Cappuccinos served with seltzer water, sideboards are excellent. Plenty of space for seating and casual conversation. Every time I  go in here I know I will get the drink the way I order it. Consistently week after week. Love the old rustic feel of the place. The staff is wonderful and friendly. Baked goods are fresh but I go here for the coffees and the preparations."}, {"review_id": "ESPyqUjlcfqWvSvYBYQL0g", "user_id": "5cwTq9Iv9z_5-s7_ZfNQlg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "Mama Carmen's ranks somewhere in the middle for NWA coffee shops. Their coffee drinks are good but the variety is limited. Their beans are decent but nothing to write home about. The quality of the service is decent but it doesn't stand out. What I really like about Mama Carmen's is its physical space. There's a really pretty/funky mural on the outside of the building. The acoustics inside are good - you can hear the person sitting across from you, and I wasn't overwhelmed by other conversations. There are plenty of big tables and electric outlets, making it a perfect place to study. I stayed for maybe an hour with no hassle to leave. There are also fair-trade items for sale. All in all, I recommend Mama Carmen's for the space. The coffee is alright, though there is better in NWA."}, {"review_id": "Ir9KUcmEVfHSAiuODYevrQ", "user_id": "WkhxVSslWMdi2RAWlc05kQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/5/2017", "text": "Really good coffee. Very close to their competition here in NWA but a step up from what we get in Chicago. Their coffee is superb. The cappuccinos are excellent. Been here like 3 times. Never disappointed. I also like their social mission. Cool"}, {"review_id": "N18F2vbCHkynlJnC2dhSXg", "user_id": "56WqmLwz3E04pZKk8r90Tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "Mama Carmen's is a very chill ambiance. There are people studying and doing work. There is a separate room for study groups. The baristas there were upbeat and helpful. They talked me through the menu and tried to make sure I ordered a drink that I would like. I ended up getting a lavender chai with a double shot. The lavender is made with bitters (?) from what I remember him saying, and it was subtle and delicious note to the drink. I love stopping at Mama Carmen's any time I'm in Fayetteville!"}, {"review_id": "TFc6FH10dhzQ-Sg-Mh-2XQ", "user_id": "qBVQY_uYYU96VVZjlOg4aA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "Decent coffee and tea menu. There are two separate dining rooms and the place is usually packed with college students. Service was nice and prompt, waiting no longer than 5 mins for a coffee when there were a few people ordering on front of me.

LIKE THERE AIN'T NO SUCH THANG AS ICED CAPPUCCINOS !!!Then he went and made my drank but it still had too much milk in it. And after all that it really was not that great. I could tell it was not made with tha love of that guy, Mama Carmen or even Jesus Christ our lord and savior!So please pray fer Mama Carmen cuz if she be a real person she is either rollin' in her grave or her office chair if she is alive. I'll lead the first one.Dear Lord,Thank you fer all that ya give us like earth, fried chicken and even the Ford F-150 Superduty. I am prayin' to ya so that you may open the eyes of tha closed hearted folks who do not believe in yer glory or Iced Cappuccinos. Please help them see your light as the truth and also the deliciousness of Iced Coffee dranks as a different truth they could also embrace. I would also like to pray fer all the poor people who cannot afford to have coffee every day. They deserve coffee more than anyone!In your name we pray,Mason Brooksyelp elite"}, {"review_id": "b9FJHBGB1wgv-oSMbr7S-g", "user_id": "ZzNH8FepkBeFip17xRlH5Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "The coffee is good and the price is what you would expect for a coffee shop. My only upset with this place is the vibe. I didn't come in wearing the same clothes as everyone else that was in there so I felt stared at and way out of place.

Their baristas, even if they've never seen you before smile, welcome you, and act like they actually enjoy their job.  They also don't act like you are an inconvenience to the conversation they were having with their coworker.  What's sad is I knew the staff, manager, and even attended the church behind this.  Now they lost their local community impact for a cash cow attitude.  The customer base too, like another review mentioned is very homogeneous.  You'd think they would realize that their \"mission\" includes each and every customer that comes to their counter and make an effort to make the atmosphere inviting to those not already part of their \"group\".Oh, and parking is obscene."}, {"review_id": "6ZQK8xVPmSat-2YeAGawWw", "user_id": "JA8PZyEgtIoDNsYz0XKF4g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/16/2017", "text": "Coffee is pretty good. I usually get an Americano 8 oz. but they almost always make it a 10oz and dilute the true flavor of the coffee. I've come here a dozen times and not once has the staff smiled or been welcoming. I have to ask them how they are and smile at them to get some sense of community. This will likely be the last time I frequent this place since there are friendly community spots like Arsaga's and Onyx and Whole Foods just across the street."}, {"review_id": "BYtT_1uzT1exo1TwEkgIbw", "user_id": "npD9KeIpB7PX3OwBMxZ3EQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/19/2016", "text": "Mama Carmen's is the perfect little shop to curl up in on a rainy day. And that's what we did for a little bit on a Saturday morning. All the little nooks & crannies make for some interesting seating arrangements and allow you to find that hidden corner when you want to be tucked away. The coffee hit the spot: great blend of coffee to milk to honey.
