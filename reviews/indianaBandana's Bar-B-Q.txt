Sides not so much.Ordered a 2-meat dinner plate.  The beef was the perfect texture.  Perfectly cooked, sliceable, soft, moist.  Not much was added to flavor the beef, so you do need to use some of the 6 choices of BBQ sauces.  I like that I have to actually chew the meat a little as opposed to meat that just falls apart.  The ribs were also very good.  A little bark to it, with a subtle sweet rub.  They were perhaps a hair on the dry side, and didn't quite come off the bone completely clean, but for me, the texture was perfect.  The BBQ game here is LEGIT!The coleslaw was decent and perfect amount of vinegar and creaminess.Now for the bad.  The boiled peanut appetizer was terrible.  The waitress warned us, but I needed to try it anyway.  They were WAY OVERCOOKED!  It was pretty much mush inside, basically barely holding onto its peanut shape.  Usually these things have a bit of snap to them and not a mash potato consistency.  The brine was perfect though.  My baked potato was also way overcooked.  To the point where the potato innards were turning brown.Service was good and friendly.I came here for good BBQ, and I got that!  But the sides I think could improve."}, {"review_id": "VdPJGEXd8TqDNAxcJOERqA", "user_id": "v_GZLU1TZy9Dg0FZ5PrrVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "The husband just loves this place!  We have enjoyed everything that we have tried so far.

The food is excellent, my favorite being beef brisket, but have never been disappointed by any of their BBQ.

The service was prompt, and the server was courteous and professional. My food arrived promptly, and the server stopped by often to check on my needs. I ordered the Pork platter, selecting potato salad and coleslaw as my two sides. The food was decent for the most part. I was not however, impressed with the potato salad, as it tasted very much like that generic, outsourced restaurant fare that is ubiquitous in the area. The pork was good but a little on the dry side, requiring the addition of sauce to moisten it up. The coleslaw was okay. One thing that disappointed me was the absence of sliced dill pickles, and fresh onion slices, which are generally a staple in Bar-B-Q restaurants around here. Another suggestion would be to add German Potato Salad to the menu (and maybe a slice of rye bread as an option). This was not my first stop here, and it won't be my last, as it is conveniently located and the food and service are for the most part, pretty decent. Next time, I'll try the fried corn!"}, {"review_id": "m2iG4GNbKsnt_Q6Qn0Mmhw", "user_id": "7Q5BhwEAeKXxsNc6W85vPQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2016", "text": "My overall busy here was okay. My food portions didn't seem huge but it was enough to fill me up. I came on a busy night and the parking lot was full. It was really hard to find parking because their parking lot wasn't surrounding the entire building. It is you shaped so if you can't find a parking spot you would have to reverse and back out and I saw a lot of people doing that. It's not very convenient and dangerous for other vehicles that are parked around.We had a 10-minute waiting time because the restaurant was so packed.

Plenty of food on the dinner platter and I always have leftovers.   ;)Dessert options are limited to fried donut holes for I believe $5.  I wish they would offer bread pudding,  a fruit pie, cheesecake or something besides donut holes.  Really!Service had been mostly fine but a couple of times our waitress has been way too casual as in calling us baby and whining about her sunburn, letting us in on how she dreaded taking a shower later.  Good God. The interior offers booths and tables and is clean but can get loud and very crowded-feeling.   Get there early for baked potatoes - they seem to run out often.Parking is tight.  One entrance, one exit.  Very difficult to turn around."}, {"review_id": "-9xSWtEnZ75PHS0yCu0nJQ", "user_id": "O7Mn1qZYLSJ5qJgwyi1Czg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/30/2015", "text": "Had the chicken plate with barbq Beans and loaded baked potatoe w/cheese.
