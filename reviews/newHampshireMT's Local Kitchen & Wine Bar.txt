The food was good but the service was so much better than our first visit !!  I had the exact same conversation with the bartender, she was so helpful getting me something that went so well with my dinner.  The restaurant sent a gift card because our first experience was so bad.We will be visiting more often and sitting at the bar!!  Thank you again"}, {"review_id": "1rRhAceU2uWvf7V1nepLzw", "user_id": "9bR_HILAQDOpejwynGCzBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Reviewed years ago when it was the original Michael Timothys [which I miss], and figured I'd update. Was and remains a great spot for drinks and usually great food coupled with great service.Bartenders are alway great and personable and over time you do hear of the chefs changing, which is normal, and the menu changes a bit and levels off again with consistancy. The rough spot right now, for me anyways, is the pizzas and the burgers. These were always their strong elevated bar food staples. They were always good to excellent, but last few times the pizza isn't working like it used to [and the price has gone up a bit] as well as the burger. Both leaning towards mediocre.Had a pizza back in the fall that sounded interesting but what was served was inedible. Was more the flavors than the execution and was sent back...and had a pizza more recent that was, again, sounding good, but was below average when it arrived. Just had that undercooked look and feel as if it was all precooked [including the crust], thrown together and heated briefly. Just didn't feel like their usual, freshly fired grilled pizza. Left us wondering if they even use woodgrill on the certain nights or pizzas anymore.The burger was subpar, burnt tasting carmelized onions that were taken too far and the burger was allowed to cool, so was not only congealed but was not hot. Clunky cold and soggy onion ring tossed inside, and an almost-white slice of tomato that was quickly removed [tomatos are so not in season]. The pizzas are not cheap [20.00], and have gotten smallish... but the price of the burger was forgiving so, not a huge deal.Other than a few recent missteps out of the kitchen, we have had too many good experiences to beat them up. Just worth noting and maybe the kitchen team needs to step it up a notch, as the some of the items that should be served fresh, just seem to be held.The bread comes out of the Merrimack bakery and is amazing, as it appears the dessert tray offerings do as well.3 1/2 stars for food5 stars for serviceAnd 5 stars for comfortable ambiance4 stars seems to be fair."}, {"review_id": "66k9Itv5RlaGOQMnodtpig", "user_id": "sJbT6zEEHavUYWMEWvvBpg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Great place!

We had a group going out and someone recommended this so we decided to give it a try. It looks like a nice sized place but I couldn't really see everything and we were in a corner off the main entrance. All the food I think is local and while the portions weren't huge, the food was great. I'll have to keep an eye on their menu and see when it changes and give them another try as it was a good place to eat."}, {"review_id": "FilaQH6XJgv41AVVGn-nOQ", "user_id": "hQ4_1ql6Y4gqVatJ1Exp_g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I brought my husband to MT's for a late valentines date i made reservations even got there over 10minutes early.

We called ahead of time and were happy to know they could accommodate us. It's a very quaint restaurant. It felt very homey and friendly. We ordered a couple off small dishes and one main one. The restaurant was really great about letting us take our time. Each dish was brought out separately and we were allowed time to savor each bite. For starters we ordered the French Onion Soup. It's made with veggie broth. It was so good. I didn't feel like it was missing a lot of flavor by not using beef broth. Our second course was the lobster Mac and cheese. This was awesome, honey goodness. Did I mention it had truffle flavor in it?! Yum!!! For our third dish we got the scallops. I have to admit I was a little weary of what we were going to get because there were a lot of ingredients mentioned in type dish. I thought it was going to be sitting in a soupy mess. It was awesome! The kitchen was nice enough to split the dish for us before it arrived at our table. The sausage with the veggies brought an unbelievable flair to the dish. We loved it! Everything was crisp too, nothing soggy. For dessert we went with the special. I think it was like a panna cotta with a lot of fruit flavors like mango, strawberry, etc. it was really good. We don't live in town, but when we are back to visit I'll be sure to come back here to see what the next seasonal menu has in store!"}, {"review_id": "ufI6maxonPy1hnh4N16g7w", "user_id": "i2dkuiHX0WzQqDDnoQLg-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "The food is delicious!

Called to ask if they had call ahead seating and they don't but we were told there wasn't a wait for 2 which surprised us.We were greeted immediately by two very friendly hostesses and on our way in we saw one (of about 8-10) outdoor tables that just finished and left so we inquired about that but it was already spoken for. About a 15-20 minute wait for the next. We decided to eat inside and were seated immediately at a table for two right in front of the window. Very cozy!Service: Very good!Busboy filled our water classes as we sat down and glasses were never empty.Waitress was very friendly and attentive but seemed new or nervous.Food: Excellent!Complimentary bread: warm, crusty outside and soft inside. The multigrain had a hint of honey and was better than the \"white\". Both better than most restaurants. Whipped butter was also very good.Field greens (to share): bite size greens easy to fork, tossed in a lite creamy dressing with homemade croutons and small chucks of ham (?). Plenty to share if ordering entrees.Braised BBQ Beef special over bucatoni pasta with brookdale summer squash snd corn. Pasta cooked al dente, beef melt in your mouth and sauce very flavorful sweet and subtle tangy.Lobster Melt with a side of fries: bite size chunks of lobster with cream cheese melted on toasted buttered  brioche bread. A little too much cream cheese for me which overpowered the lobster. Fries were a little salty for my taste and hand cut would have earned another half star.Atmosphere: comfortable, cozy and average noise level.Our window seat in the bar section was very cozy which provided privacy. Clean bathroom.Parking: on street and we did not have any problems finding parking right on Main about 800 feet from the restaurant.Would definitely return to try some of their other offerings! $68 including tip (for two), water for drinks."}, {"review_id": "jWwyF7LbG2-Mct6Pn4A_Xg", "user_id": "oHiAmHNkea-uc_JHl14HMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/12/2017", "text": "Coming to Nashua from Boston, by way of Portsmouth, has been tough on me (a self-professed foodie).  I mean, I like good food, especially when I am paying top-dollar to have someone else prepare it and serve it. :)Well, thank gawd for MT's Loacl...  Far and away the place place in Nashua that I have found since becoming a frequent diner in Nashua 3 months ago.   In fact, it's so good I am finding myself there 1 or 2 nights a week, every week (single guy / not in the mood to cook for myself after work most nights).Great menu.  Great drinks.

Didn't need the reservation as maybe half the tables were full. Really enjoyed it from start to finish. Casey, our server, was excellent. She quickly brought over a basket of warm fresh bread. For starters we had baked oysters (very good), side field salad (good), and two of us, including myself, had their soup of the day, mushroom sausage in a cream broth. This was one of the better soups I have had in a long time. I was tempted to order a second cup before the entree.Our entrees included lamb bolognese, crab cake salad, buttermilk fried chicken, and mine being their beef tournedos. All plates were licked clean. My tournedos were two 4oz beef medallions cooked to a perfect medium, served on toast rounds and topped with tomato, pancetta, and spinach hollandaise. It was served with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. Yes, licked clean.Very happy finally getting to MT's as we have been wanting to for quite some time. It's a very cozy clean location on Main Street in Nashua. We were not disappointed and will definitely go back. I hope they have that cream of mushroom with sausage soup again :)"}, {"review_id": "k2PDX7R8PZR_GJsOWDYbxQ", "user_id": "FQ6rTipeG8rg7BV-9RyEEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "DO NOT PASS UP THIS RESTAURANT! I can't say enough great things about this place to everyone I've seen in the last four days! As two people who have spent their lives working in restaurants, many compliments to the Chef and management team. Our server was kind and funny and made great recommendations. Our starters were to die for (we will actually probably try to recreate your Brussels Sprout and Apple salad!) and paired perfectly with the first of tasting of Portugal wines you were featuring that night. You cannot go wrong with the Duck Confit, or the Proscuitto either for that matter. We indulged in the special, which was a sweet and spicy pork tenderloin, and before we even realized it, we had cleaned our plates! We didn't do any dessert, sadly, but we drooled over the desserts that other tables got and I'm pretty confident that you can't go wrong with a gluten free chocolate cake. Seriously. I will be back, and it will definitely be soon.
