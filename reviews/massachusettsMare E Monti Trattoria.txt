The atmosphere, the friendly wait staff, the delicious food. Can not recommend this place enough!My husband and I decided to bring our family here after our small wedding ceremony last year, and came back again tonight for our 1st anniversary.  The garlic oil that comes to the table with fresh bread is light, the Caesar salad is crisp and yummy. Tonight I experienced a new love... the Gnocchi Alessia... the creaminess of the gnocchi and goat cheese will literally melt in your mouth. And don't forget dessert and cappuccino afterwards!!!!!"}, {"review_id": "DWmZ1YF2JKgn4sonpU7QVA", "user_id": "7xX3MTsPQs5r-Zy9y7Jk3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Fantastic food!!!

Maybe it was a mix?Veal parmigiana with spaghetti was excellent, rich and textured in all the right ways. Baked haddock with risotto and green beans was scrumptious, flaky and well balanced. I'd likely want to return and try other dishes.I'm subtracting a point for a few details.Two servers squeezed past me instead of stopping to let me walk to and from the restroom, notably acknowledging my presence but not pausing for that second or two it takes to make a customer feel like a star.Parking on the street is tricky, especially considering the snow banks and many residences in the area.Notably, our food came way too fast, less than 5 minutes, which makes it more likely that they just reheated it. Risotto takes at least 20 minutes, so they're either great mind readers or practiced reheaters. It was also annoying because I was hoping to have a leisurely conversation with dinner. Definitely more of a \"sit, eat, leave\" kind of place.Finally, this is called a \"trattoria\" but it's just an average restaurant where you can't see the kitchen. And it does look weird to have the bar right in front of you when you walk in.That said, the four stars are solidly earned and I'd come again."}, {"review_id": "ULjOUL0hfzN2kTFvFWzVKQ", "user_id": "Cx8SyXD23b24W34fEfU5ug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "My friend suggested we try this place and it's literally a hidden gem, a hole in the wall. It was tucked away on a tiny street I never would have guessed to turn into. I spoke with the owner who was so polite and hospitable. Everything about this place was nice. It has a great ambiance and the food is amazing. I ordered the salmon which was a very generous portion size that came with sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes and rapini (broccoli rabe). Not to mention the bread with oil..that was so delicious! I will definitely be returning to this place!"}, {"review_id": "zMcGF9lXwunbuuh2lQESPg", "user_id": "zF0wuFMzEm7nZuBZ_WsQ5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "We got there a few minutes earlier from their opening time. Guy at the bar was kind of rude, telling us to wait outside when there's a waiting area inside. This was quickly redeemed once a kind waitress invited us inside and seated us early. Good thing cause we were a second away from going somewhere else. I deducted a star cause he made us feel bad. Otherwise, food and waitress service were quite good!Environment: Open, clean, with a lot of seating. Designs were rustic and very italian-y. Seems great for a romantic date, or if you want to indulge in delicious Italian cuisine. Mushroom Ravioli: It was creamy and heavy on the stomach (but what so you expect with this sort of pasta dish). I found it was delicious. I loved that there was plenty of mushroom too. Flavor was very rich. I didn't finish the meal, but definitely was excited for leftovers. Eggplant (side dish): It was huge considering the price for the side order. I felt the eggplant was cooked perfectly. Not too thin or thick cut, and had the perfect amount of parmesan sauce."}, {"review_id": "LCCFrf2GyRQSzlwMIxJ_MQ", "user_id": "rVlRiyicQf1aDrf1YGO1Zg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Very solid bet for good Italian food. I ordered the steak, was cooked right and the veggies that came with it complimented it well. My mother had the chicken parm, she wasnt a fan. I tried a piece, and i could say that the tomato sauce was lacking something. Not sure what it is, tasted very pure though. But untouched by seasoning. The mussels appetizer was great, absolutely loved it. Finished the whole thing and the broth that it was cooked in. The setting is nice, very rustic and soft lighting. Parking is a bit weird, mostly street parking. I'll be visiting this place again some time next month, until then, i do recommend this place for anyone looking to try good Italian food."}, {"review_id": "UiCNrG31-E591syt1quLMg", "user_id": "SCDlBvTPZf6hC3tdCSRFEQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "My whole take on the whole Italian food situation in the U.S. is i need honesty. We all know Italian American is NOT Italian food. And I would say this place is honest. I mean family honest since they do still name it Trattoria. This is Italian American food. Don't judge me. Sometimes a girl needs a bowl of warm pesto with Prego sauce. Its just ok. The food is ok. The drinks are ok. Although the bar situation is a bit weird and at first when you walk you think you're at a Dive Bar in Arkansas. But the actual dining area is cute with its exposed brick walls and adorable art work.If you are craving Gnocchi or the creamy risotto you experienced during your last trip to Florence this place isn't it for you.But if you're in Worcester on a cold Thursday night and you want some filling food that won't break the bank then come here."}, {"review_id": "ur3fmHvbqDSho_hxF1afGA", "user_id": "TId_yQ6mEJ9FOl3vF277eA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Pretty good find thanks to yelp.

Interior is small but cozy and intimate, making the dinner experience all the more enjoyable. I ordered the pollo amaretto with linguine and parmesan--delectable to say the least. I never believed amaretto liquor would be such a compatible choice for a breaded chicken entree, yet boy was it tasty. Their \"visual\" dessert menu was very tasty too, both to the eyes and to the palate. Last thing to say about this place is to not be fooled by the location! Even though it is just off the main drag of Kelley square, it still makes for an affordable dinner experience without having to worry about contributing to the gentrification in other parts of Worcester."}, {"review_id": "Uhdr1pmWVqanooCorN8Akg", "user_id": "qNyqTw8AnvGdLcodNbCR2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Excellent quality authentic Italian fare.

I would give the food 4 stars and the service 3 stars due to one bad experience.The reason I cannot give the food 5 stars is because of the inconsistency. Things that are AMAZING are the goat cheese gnocchi (very very rich, but delish), the mushroom ravioli, and of course the bolognese with house-made pappardelle (this is a must get). Things that were fine but nothing mind blowing are the calamari and the arancini. Things that I had issues with were the amaretto torte and a muchroom chicken special. The torte had way too much amaretto extract. I love amaretto, but it was like they accidentally tipped the whole bottle in it. Maybe it was just a bad batch? I know others have loved it. And the mushroom chicken special was a complete disaster. It was just horrible. I think this was the only time in my life that I honestly couldn't eat a dish I ordered. In terms of service, they are generally \"ok\" (nothing horrible, but nothing to write home about). The reason for the 3 stars on the service is due to the horrible mushroom chicken special incident. Unfortunately that night the waitress didn't come by to even notice that I was not eating a bite or inquire if there was an issue. Instead, some teenage looking kid came over and (without any question as to why the dish was hardly touched) asked if I was done and took it away. It was really too bad that they weren't able do service recovery on this. The staff should have noticed this and asked about it. Had the manager come over to inquire how our meal was, that would have been an opportunity to mention it also, but no manager seemed to be on the floor. I still come here because the dishes that are good are SO good, but there is room for improvement in the service department and in consistency of food. Overall, I recommend. Just stick to the menu and avoid the specials. You can't go wrong with the dishes I mentioned above."}, {"review_id": "QCsmir8hj2HnEUenacNLSA", "user_id": "-WHFJpYxpvu3VRfw79NorA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "This is my favorite Italian place in Worcester without question.  It's quintessential Worcester in its location surrounded by triple deckers off Wall St (which is nothing like the Wall St in NYC).  The valet parking is a surprise then the actual restaurant is spacious and well decorated.  I am partial to the Chicken Parmigiana which is boring, but it never disappoints.  This place can get very busy and does not take reservations, but it's well worth it."}, {"review_id": "Qe9Mv0V7D16z7PAL8ZH5Jw", "user_id": "wnLt57hS02lQ36cyXGk5dw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Another hidden gem of Worcester.
