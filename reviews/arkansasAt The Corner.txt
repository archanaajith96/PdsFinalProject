On Saturday and Sunday mornings you'll find a line around the corner in line for the scrumptious breakfast that they've delicately prepared. They've got brunch staples like the breakfast sampler, waffles, and even some originals like my favorite, the Cowboy Breakfast which includes biscuits and gravy topped with fried chicken (go with me on this)... its amazing.Lunch there seems to be a whole different story. I've gone a couple different times for their lunch and it must be different cooks or something. Service can be spotty during the week and food has come out cold multiple times for both me and the person I got lunch with that day.Overall I do recommend, but for the love of warm delicious food.. go for weekend brunch!"}, {"review_id": "LyD_u6nPXo6pjUvjLzwOtw", "user_id": "HFH98woCb-LN7-BAhI4Cyw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "If you're looking for a good place to have brunch, try this spot!!!  It's a comact spot that is typically busy so you'll more than likely have to wait in line.Ok so here we go :)Ambiance: Loved the retro diner vibe!  While it's a smaller spot, the large windows provided a tranquil vibe.  Loved the red pop of color throughout the establishment!Location: It's located in the heart of downtown, so be prepared to park and walk or pay for parking.Staff: Super nice and attentive!Restaurant's Protocol: When you come in your given a menu.  You wait in line to place your order. Coffee station is self serve (near the @ symbol) and the other beverages are near the registrar (self serve as well).  After you pay, they provide you with a number that you place within the metal stand at your table.  Food: Man oh man!  The food was delicious and fresh!  I got the brunch sampler and waffles.The plating for the sampler was cute.Homemade biscuit was wonderful.  Eggs were fluffy and moist.  The pairing of the sweet fruit and cheese grits was mouth watering.  Bacon was to die for.  The waffle was crunchy on the outside aand soft on the inside.I literally can wait to go back and try the other dishes on the menu."}, {"review_id": "RtErJqNv9JD7Q6hqipoK6A", "user_id": "hfjhPcnjD3PSK_QTfE5dpA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Went for breakfast at 10 Sunday morning. The line was outside of the door, it took 30 minutes to make it to the front of the line to order. I got the hash, which was very tasty but was $17!!! Everything that came out of the kitchen looked great, but is so overpriced, $12 for a biscuit and gravy?! I just can't....However, everyone was super nice, the service was very friendly. It was just so packed and crowded, I felt rushed and it was hard to enjoy my nearly $20 breakfast."}, {"review_id": "GTQeQI_pfKTMDVmryGiiEw", "user_id": "UzVUBcqL2Ht6v-KjLNRGgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "At The Corner is Where It's At for breakfast the ole' fashion way in Little Rock!!!  Rock solid meals based on the owner's grandmother's loving recipes!  Firstly, @ The Corner is just darn cute!!!  Appointed perfectly in classy 50's hop diner tables, booths' and dining bar.  You order at the register and food is brought to you based on your number.The food is incredible... Real food, handmade with love - You can taste it!!!  The grits...These are the BEST GRITS TO BE HAD ANYWHERE!  Initially, I was disappointed with portion... Ahh until I tasted it.  These are the richest most fully flavored, heartiest grits in the world!  I could not have eaten a larger portion if my life depended on it!  I told the people I was eating with that these would win contest and probably be used to construct and edible building !!!  Incredible !Enjoy and send me a note about your grits experience !!!!"}, {"review_id": "PhU0G7dJGYOxJmDien8RsQ", "user_id": "6KdIc-HOvn_FVfIDDATJhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Absolutely fantastic experience! The atmosphere was comfy bright! Decided to check this place out while on a work-related trip to the city. Although there was a line out the door, my food came out quicker than expected after ordering. Got the Cowboy breakfast and mason jar mimosa.

The line may intimidate you but don't let it! Get your ass in line, read the menu and order. That's it . They really take care of everything else.

Ive been twice in the last couple weeks and both times the service and the food have been incredible. Each weekend has been themed with options named and related to the theme. One around Earth Day and one around the Lion King, which was playing down the street. They also have a few recurring classics that are always on the menu. I tried the Cowboy Breakfast and loved it! Also the Rafiki Toast was so so good. My friend had a crab cake thing and then just the classic Breakfast Sampler and had equally great things to say about both of those dishes. I recommend the place highly, and would go back in a heartbeat."}, {"review_id": "tPOWkIHe63yX61U7LCFMJg", "user_id": "j3DhG4pSvQ1ILqIZmCah_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Every time I'm in Little Rock I eat brunch here.

We came around the holidays and they had a special menu based around the movie \"the grinch,\" which was fun and different. We had the mulled wine French toast (which was okay) and a much heartier option with fried chicken and biscuits (which was great!) We'll be back to see what other fun seasonal things they offer in the future.Tips:1) Parking is kind of difficult, we had to circle around a few times to find street parking and walk a little distance. 2) You order at the counter and then are directed to a seat! Not the most conventional process but it worked well for us. 3) Coffee is self serve, so don't wait for a server to come pour you more!"}, {"review_id": "ffS73lYuB_FFRL53iksN5w", "user_id": "2KquSGfWJt9g0_CoQ1X82A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "BLUF:I definitely recommend coming here for breakfast/brunch. The service and food were fantastic and the atmosphere was fun. I'll make an effort to stop in every trip to Little Rock.This is a nice little place.

The service:The service was great, everyone was very friendly, the staff looked happy to be there, and everything seemed smooth even though the place had gotten packed with people.The food:I ordered the cowboy breakfast which came out maybe five minutes after I ordered. I was a little nervous as it's been a long time since I've had good biscuits and gravy but in a happy turn of events this is probably the best I've ever had. As an added bonus the cowboy breakfast comes with some fried chicken and an egg on top.
