I love to go here for dates or to bring family or friends from out of town or just to hang out. Beer 10/10. Consistent and excellent. The bear blend (coffee oatmeal stout) is one of the best coffee brews I've ever had. So smooth, I love it more than the famed \"gotta get up to get down\" brew from the wiseacre brewery in Memphis. Love their seasonal brews and guest brews so far as well. If not for the calories I would get a flight every time I came here.Food 10/10. My significant other loves their veggie burger. We each vouch for the street tacos. The chicken sliders are a guilty pleasure of mine. The fun little pickled garnish on the appetizer plates is something I really enjoy- either pickled cauliflower, carrot or garlic usually. Right now we are in love with their salads, got the jackson avenue salad last time which is SO GENEROUS with the greens, lovely house made vinaigrette is not overpowering, pecans and bleu cheese are perfect with grilled chicken for your protein. I could get it every time."}, {"review_id": "ZVNtEj2QjgTNDvATJTfE4A", "user_id": "j9Z1dcoZrwn8Ul9JTnjjug", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/6/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Came here on a Thursday night. It wasn't so busy, so you would think the service would be on point. Sadly, what I got here was a little disappointing. I love the beer that they have and I want to say this place is a solid 4 for beer.What I got today was \"The Beast\" burger. But for a $14.99 burger...it was a little pathetic. You would think for a $15 burger it would be big, loaded to the max, right? Nope. And let's just say, if you're on a low carb diet... Balter fails, I mean fails at lettuce wraps. Its not a big problem and can be easily fix, yet they probably won't.Why do I say they fail at lettuce wraps? I mean look at it! They just literally put two leaves on it. THIS IS NOT HOW A LETTUCE WRAP SHOULD BE. I know, I'm a little weird not eating carbs... But hey, everyone have their own tastes. Look, the way I see it, lettuce is cheap. And the more lettuce you put on a burger, the bigger it looks...so why don't you put more lettuce?? So I guess this is a warning for low carb, keto diet people... This isn't the place you're looking for if you're in that category. Overall, let's just say that the beer is good. The service was a bit slow, I think my waiter forgot that I ordered beer as it took forever to get... I'll probably come back, but for me Balter won't be of a place that I'll crave for."}, {"review_id": "PObyBdGHNcUDWAD5LZ2_WQ", "user_id": "G83ws5i36RnMbVpvK2G-Kw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I recently took my boyfriend there for the first time for dinner. We shared the fried green tomatoes and they were perfectly crunchy and delicious! The burrito bowl was equally stellar. My only complaint would be that it can be noisy when the restaurant is full which makes hearing each other a little difficult.

In the multiple times I've eaten here, I have never been disappointed. The portions are ample for the price, and the ingredients seem very fresh in each dish I've tried so far. On Sundays they serve a cold brunch buffet featuring an assortment of baked goods, pastas and salads to munch on. There can be a bit of a long wait during peak times, but the tables tend to open up pretty quickly during the day. My recommendations: the fish and chips, any of the burrito bowls, or my favorite: the flour and blue corn fish tacos with the pintos."}, {"review_id": "NJOuMNKWWVJpQFxldIi27Q", "user_id": "mpgutAY2YC4FiNxMNcx4HA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Omg their Mac and cheese literally made me do a happy dance!

I was skeptical of nachos on potato chips but they were amazing! Be sure to add bacon. We devoured these and not a crumb of topping was left on the plate! Followed the appetizer with a black bean burger. Super yummy and the chipotle mayo was a nice addition. The sweet potato waffle fries were crunchy and the perfect side kick to my burger.

The atmosphere is great. It's rustic and modern. There are several large community tables but also smaller ones for more intimate seating. There's a great dog friendly patio as well. I was pleasantly surprised that the beer was so great. They have 4 standards and then they had a couple special ones. We tried three of the standards and the cask ale they had that day. They were all really good. The coffee porter tasted like coffee and was smooth and flavorful. The kolsch is super light and refreshing.  I had the Tillamook burger. It's cheddar, bacon, bbq. The bacon was delicious and there was plenty of it. The burger is two small patties but they are filling and they were cooked just right with tons of juices spilling out as I ate it. The mac and cheese looked underwhelming but had great flavor. You can definitely taste the garlic and onion and it was nice and creamy. Good service as well and it looked like they had a lot of local/small batch liquors. Wish I didn't live so far away!"}, {"review_id": "I0u7-L-P89H6QQJWy1ErfQ", "user_id": "5W4J7QFZZV4AyFA_3UcW-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Love the food here and the pet-friendly patio.

Its more of a restaurant than brewery.  Lots of booths a high community tables.  I ordered a beer but I cant tell you I remember what it was.
