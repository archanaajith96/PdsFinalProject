From the moment my fiancé and I walked in to the moment we walked out we were simply amazed by the food, drinks, and service at The Birch on Elm. I would highly recommend this to anyone with an adventurous palate and a love of creative drinks. We shared the frites with mushroom aioli. The inside was fluffy and super hot while the outside was crunchy. I ordered one of the specials, BBQ pork ravioli and it was amazing. It might become a regular menu item soon! My fiancé ordered the ox tail tacos and those were incredible! The way the chef prepares food is with knowledge and care. The drinks! The drinks were sooo good. I had a glass of rosé, a traditional whiskey sour (with an egg white!!!), and a drink not mentioned on the menu. I think it was called the Blackstrap because of the dark rum, you can taste the brown sugar notes, so good. Again, I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. The service was miles above what was expected."}, {"review_id": "RUL_famWTia6Ezbyz6I_2A", "user_id": "t3GrfEfCS-Boy7kvMVK7wg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Amazing !!

Seriously. When it came to my brunch preferences, TBOE checked off a slew of boxes. Chef Provencher's menu was on the modern side and changed every few months as it was comprised of seasonally inspired dishes made with locally-sourced ingredients. And there was something for everyone too! They usually offered several familiar items such as chicken and waffles or avocado toast but there were also options for adventurous foodies such as some interesting tacos or octopus bites! Speaking of which, I implore readers to base judgements on how something tastes rather than what it is. ___Best of What I've Tried___-Avocado toast (Roasted tomato hummus, parsley pesto, toasted almonds, house sourdough): As a millennial, I've learned to love avocado toast. However, I tend to scoff at the idea of paying real money for someone else to make this for me. TBOE did a good enough job where I didn't really mind. Interesting flavors for sure. The homemade bread was a nice touch. -Crab cakes benedict (english muffin, roasted corn, swiss chard, pickled swiss chard stems, five-minute egg): Loved the crab cakes and the roasted corn. Pickled swiss chard was also a nice touch of brightness.  This place also made some of the best mixed drinks I've had in NH! They were pretty creative and exceptionally made. My favorite was the Cardstock Paper Plane (bourbon, cantaloupe aperol, cardamaro, lemon, honey) but they also make some awesome-as-hell pineapple drinks. I honestly used these to pretend that it wasn't snowing outside and I was in a warmer area. After a few visits, I trusted the bartender (Tiffany?) enough to let her make me whatever the hell she wanted. That's pretty rare for me. If you can't decide what drink to order and she is working the bar, go ahead and roll the dice with bartender's choice. Ambiance was a bit hipster, modern, clean, and classy. Couches added to the relaxing atmosphere and I needed that on weekends. They also played some decent music (think it was Sugar Rey and Rebelution on my first visit). Service was cool. Think my server was Michelle and she was real chill. Same with tiffany. ___Why I'm Withholding One Star___-Some over their items were interesting and adventurous, but I didn't think really worked out. -Poutine was salty, even for poutine. Think I'd love it if drunk. -Need to teach bartenders the recipe before the menu is released. I came in once and ordered an original craft cocktail that was featured on their instagram and was told the head bartender or whatever didn't teach that recipe yet. -Not \"as good as it gets\" for me"}, {"review_id": "-h1abDDaHTZHKd27mmiADQ", "user_id": "4jrsG-2hLz0lgyThf0DhJg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I got dragged into this place for a work meeting/event. Definitely not my type of place. Very weird menu for adventurous eaters, it feels like it's weird just for the sake of being weird.Being diabetic, I can't eat more than 30g of carbohydrates a day - doctors orders. So I avoid them at all costs. One thing on the menu seemed like it would be okay - steak and cheese on steamed buns.So I ordered that, and requested that they exclude the buns, since I would not eat them. They actually refused to accommodate this request as it \"would not do the dish justice.\" Even after saying I'm not a foodie and don't care about the presentation, they still refused.What kind of restaurant doesn't accommodate a reasonable request to omit an ingredient for a customer with dietary restrictions?Avoid this place if you have any dietary restrictions at all, since the menu changes frequently there's no guarantee that anything on it will meet your needs and they are unwilling to accommodate requests for any food that is not exactly what's on the menu."}, {"review_id": "x1g22hpqzBpSLjSauaBcVw", "user_id": "X__4-RqxoKvT6rGIFIa5Bw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Beautiful bar, nice atmosphere, very laid back. Wait staff is awesome. We spent about a good 4 hours in here talking to some regulars and even with the staff about the history on how they came about opening their business. Food was awesome and if you can decide talk to Dan or Ian to give you some options. Nice place for foodies who like to talk in abundance of all the food they like to eat. They change their menu or a regular basis about 6 times and they are open for brunch which I haven't tried yet. Overall good first time experience. We had octopus nuggets, edamame special, pork sliders can remember the exact name all were yummy."}, {"review_id": "rujTZ1mIuEUy4-KJXOpdBA", "user_id": "ZMp2fydG6vSpIiNwp68VYw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "The drinks were awesome and the service by the bartender was great but what I was given for my meal was piss-poor. First of all, let me say that we did show up 30 minutes before they closed so I understand being out of some food. We asked if we could order food and were told yes. I ordered the duck & waffles. Was told they only had chicken, which I was fine with. Once I got my plate it only had 1/4 of a waffle. Not even a full waffle. If you were out of the mix, they could have just told me but I paid for this and when I questioned it I got $2 off. So it was $18 for what you see in the pic. 3 pieces of fried chicken tenders and 1/4 of a waffle. Go for the drinks. Don't go to eat there an hour before closing because the quality/quantity of food drops. Bartender was on point though. Hate to take points away from him bc the kitchen was so shitty."}, {"review_id": "gIYNAZiSUIi52K6i4jIx4w", "user_id": "klVArEc1ufXy_qcoFoUOSQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "Pretty plating, but otherwise a pretty poor experience.Brunch time!  We ordered the chicken and waffles because I'm a champion of the combo.  We were expecting chicken tenders (the menu simply says fried, and everywhere else has tenders).  No, it was a drumstick and a thigh - which is great if you eat chicken skin and eat the meat off the bone, but not what we were expecting, not what we wanted, and we weren't warned.  But feasible, so next time I order it somewhere new, I shall ask, nbd.The chicken was overcooked on the outside (part of mine was charred) and the thigh I received was undercooked in the middle.  The waffle, though!!!  That was delightful.  A little too much butter for my taste (soggy from the pre-applied butter), but that was only in the middle.  The mushrooms were a wonderful addition and provided the salt the combination calls for, so avoiding the chicken wasn't a total loss.  Also, the special infused maple syrup they made (we each requested it on the side to be safe) was delightful - not too sweet, but definitely maple.My friend noticed a pumpkin cheesecake option when we arrived, so we decided to try it despite ourselves.  I wish we hadn't.  First, I found a piece of plastic in mine.  The waitress came over to ask how dessert was as I was holding it up conspicuously; my friend said, \"Fine except for the piece of plastic.\"  She laughed as though we were joking despite that I was holding it up.  We gave her a clear, \"This is not funny,\" look, and she nodded, turned, and continued to laugh as she walked away.  ... Seriously?Second, the cheesecake was uninspired.  The crust was, \"Meh, okay,\" the flavor of the cheesecake overall was lacking, and the texture was off.  It was more of a whipped puree than a cheesecake in both taste and texture - without much substance.  The topping was a nice tough, though; we both very much liked it, and it added an elegance to the dish.We were there for about two hours and did not see much of our waitress.  Great for conversation, bad for service.  She seemed nice, but certainly not bright, and was not very helpful.All around, a solid two-star performance: pretty bad all around, but there was some redeeming quality about each part."}, {"review_id": "EIW4A8nKuENHL1J584BsIg", "user_id": "MdX2QzEcoY_h4W42Kisy7w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Disappointing. I'd be ok with the prices if the food was great, but it was just ok. The menu is creative but the flavors weren't, and every dish we tried fell just short.  The best item we had was the tempura octopus bites, which were good but the sauce had zero flavor.  The cod tacos were just ok, the fish was crispy outside and moist inside but the sauce was bland and they came on flour tortillas.  Fish tacos should never come on anything but corn tortillas, I want to give it zero stars just for this sacrilege.  The tuna tartare was horrible, not super fresh (although the uni was fresh on top) and it was flavorless.  The drinks were great but $15 for a cocktail in Manchester is a reach.  The atmosphere is great, and the service was admittedly great as well.  If the prices were lower or the food was more memorable, I'd come here again."}, {"review_id": "5sYnU5CRncTrNxPX8LCrmA", "user_id": "IrCmkFm_00BRBHj2zE_Xhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "lunch recently, smallish, darkish place with a huge canoe hanging over the bar....pleasantly greeted upon arriving..drink variety great and watching the bartender , carefully made, though not huge....menu very different, we had the octopus app which we both thought was great, i had the braised tongue tartine and wife had the shrimp and grits, both excellent and nicely presented...you sort of have to look for this place or at least know the address as it would be easy to miss.....don't!!"}, {"review_id": "COVL5FufKy-uxFksyPI8vQ", "user_id": "Uz2c1xXp1jWOrQvhq9xeUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "I had dinner at The Birch last night for the first time.
