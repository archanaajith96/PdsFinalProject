All the dishes were on point... seasoned nicely and plentiful.  Chicken kabob grilled with a nice char but still very tender and the braised lamb shank was succulent. The yellow rice you can have by itself it was nicely seasoned. This is not a fine dining establishment but if you want good and simply prepared Mediterranean/ Middle Eastern food... enjoy this place! Oh,  yes... the service,  the night we were dining in the place was 75% full and there was a constant flow of customers picking up the take out orders.  The two waitresses working that night did not miss a beat attending to their dine in customers and take out orders.  I asked for a mint tea to have with my kunafa and the waitress said they didn't have mint tea bags. Instead she came out with standard black tea bag in cup piping hot and fresh mint on the side to flavor my tea... very clever!My colleague that dined with me the first time went back to this restaurant a few days later with his whole family and they all enjoyed their dinner."}, {"review_id": "n60j5ka0uqbMXqi6x0dokQ", "user_id": "66BZIDIjHP7xUrxbU94e7A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "As other reviewers have described, the service is dicey. The servers were all nice, and friendly, just not professional.We waited at our table for 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us.  It was only when I asked if we were supposed to order at the counter that our orders were finally taken.Chicken Shawarma was nice, and half chicken was tender (but the dark meat was dry and overcooked), yellow rice was tasty, and hummus was delicious.  Try it, just be prepared to wait a while."}, {"review_id": "ar2FTqlG9xYFoA3P97QviA", "user_id": "vF1UjblVnLV66IF4mhtS8g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "If it wasn't for the extremely delicious food I would rate this lower than three.First it took the wait staff 5 minutes to seat me.  There were three tables available and one needed to be cleaned up.Second it took seven minutes before a menu was given and no comment about what to drink.Third was the state of the men's restroom.There were towel paper on the ground, the towel bowl brush was lying on the ground.There were open trays of baklava, steps from the restrooms.My waiter ignored my attempt to get his attention to ask for bread.It was only when I used my phone did I get attention from the waiter.I think that next time I will just order my food to go."}, {"review_id": "6QzFluqqSCO9DGP9rFlaDw", "user_id": "LN08_Qyc0Xm0VekNRSgkgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I love the food here.

This place has an excellent yelp track record which is what drew me over here. The food quality was excellent. Portions are generous and prices are very affordable. I ordered the kebab platter with two lamb kababs. The lamb was some of the most succulent and delicious grilled lamb I have ever had in my life. The yellow rice that it sat adjacent to was flavorful and moist!I ordered hummus and baba ganoush as well.

Been here many times. Usually start out with some hummus or laebna(?) And pita bread. Both dips are refreshing. I have tried their roasted chicken, kabobs, schwarma, and lambchops. I get the yellow rice because im Chinese and asians love to eat rice all the time, but also because the rice is yellow and it makes my food pictures a lot more vibrant. The chicken kabob and lamb chops are delicious. The chicken is juicy and flavorful. The lambchops are cooked well with a nice crust on the outside from being grilled over the open fire. Flavors are as bold as the colors. The garlic sauce and the hot sauce they give you is great for dipping as well. I like to dip my meat in both sauces combined. Great little spot."}, {"review_id": "Ef5QbOOOO1gt9j2lzCxEYQ", "user_id": "4uN6j0T6u6vDJ4fOu3Bp6g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Ok don't get me wrong the food here is great. It's cheap and affordable but the reason I'm giving it a 3 star is because the service here today was not great at all it took about 5 mins to ask for what we would drink and we was the only people in here. My water wasnt refilled until we was getting the check and getting boxes for the food. That's why they got 3 stars"}, {"review_id": "fPFhoNNG5L09hHnga-9PvA", "user_id": "N0I0xsj4o6bARogBfEZZ9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "I initially wasn't expecting much, but figured it'd be edible based on the reviews. Well, Jasmine Grill shocked me.....I got the chicken shwarma plate with yellow rice and baba ganoush. I added a pita, extra garlic dip and hot sauce. The meat was tender. The rice was fluffy. Everything was well seasoned and the portions were a nice size. But, the icing on the cake for me was the delivery service. I'm staying at a nearby hotel and ordered through their third party, door dash. My food arrived in less than 45 minutes and was still piping hot. I got everything I ordered and the delivery guy was nice and professional. I will definitely eat here again. Good job Jasmine Grill!!"}, {"review_id": "6wc5j5eGKiPEcjclbE13fQ", "user_id": "mOanh--SkJagXdsfJU3wxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "This is an excellent Mediterranean restaurant in an unassuming shopping mall. Don't judge the book by its cover!Small little restaurant where you can order at the counter to go, or dine in and order at the table. The waiter was very friendly and welcoming. You can see the kitchen station from the tables. I ordered the Chicken Kebab plate and it came with generous portions of chicken and rice.  You also get to pick a side - so naturally I went for the side salad which was good. Dinner is super affordable here too, coworker and I ordered the same meal and a piece of baklava to share and our bill came out to $25! If anything this place should charge a little more. Great value! There are some TVs in the table area - so would be a good spot to come by if you are eating alone.

The experience is always the same.  Good food, lousy service equals mediocre. I only tolerated the bad service because it's a priced conscious restaurant. I hate to say this but the service falls under the management for not properly training your wait staff. Here's the general protocol:Once a table is seated, the guests must be greeted-acknowledged less than 3 minutes. Serve Drinks-ladies always firstSelling -suggestive sell isn't order taking Bring bread, plates for appetizers or salad to share and not wait to be askedClear dirty appetizer plates for guests before the entrees are brought to the table Checked on the guests within 2 minutes after entrees are served Refill beverages before guests ask, half empty and not half full, servers!Maintenance tables, ask if guests would like their food packed and clear table of everything except their drinksSuggest- homemade desserts Bring check & thank your customers!It's about working smarter not harder in the service industry."}, {"review_id": "T_1ntvlqUYzo1rC3OS7IOw", "user_id": "NbW0-kxkoqcjYscAZMTr7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "This is definitely one of the best places to eat for someone who likes Mediterranean food.Very authentic, right down to the friendly staff.The lamb chops weren't  good, they were perfect!

I'm glad I did... the quaint space was nice spot to enjoy an intimate meal without all the hustle and bustle that Charlotte offers at times. My food was a good size portion and one plate is enough for one person with all sides included. The only con for this place... being its a family owned business, the customer service is a little 'laxed here. A couple of the servers were in the corner on their phones ..I was finally able to grab my server's attention to get a refill. Though the service may be subpar, the food was great so I will not count them out.

The yellow rice is always one of my go to side items and is always perfectly seasoned and cooked.

This really is that good. Unexpected to find a great shawarma here in Charlotte (this isn't Dearborn, ya know) and a terrific hummus that was the right consistency.They were very, very slammed towards the end of the lunch rush with several tables needing cleaning and a long wait for ordering and then getting the check. Success is a good thing for a business, but maybe another wait-person would help?Large portion of hummus to start, with a basket of warmed pitas. Not too much longer, a big plate of the mixed lamb and beef with hot yellow rice that was light and fluffy and very nicely done. I managed to clear the entire plate.

I am fortunate to live right down the street from this place. Previously they never had a take-out menu so I never thought about it when I wanted to eat out. However, now they do and I'm there more often than I'd like to admit. The guys behind the counter work hard all the time putting out orders. And it pays off because you get quality food at a great price and time. They have an excellent lunch special and it's definitely worth coming back for dinner. My favorite is the chicken Schwarma but my parents got an all veggie dish and have not stopped talking about it."}, {"review_id": "vy_5rH5Yudrxl58ZU6W8jg", "user_id": "R4l3ONHzGBakKKNo4TN9iQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "I reallyclike this place!As the others have stated, a little sketchy looking on the outside but great place!!!(Being here at night with a dark parking lot doesn't help the feeling)  ;)I ALWAYS get shish tawook.
