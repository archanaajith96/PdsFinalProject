They have very, very decent prices2. The sizes of the rolls are a bit above average so you get a lot of bang for your buck3. The smoked salmon is amazing - get it without cream cheese though4.

Anywhere else I eat, the sushi seems to be good, but not Marc's quality. The fish is always fresh and well prepared, and Marc (who makes the sushi) is always conscious and courteous to my partner's food allergies. The staff is always attentive, my water glass never goes empty for long, and I always get what I ask for. The prices may seem a little bit more than other places, but you truly get what you pay for. The rolls are giant and certainly big enough to satisfy you and a friend. The only downside about Marc's is that it is quite small. You feel like you're on top of one another when waiting for a seat, so I do wish that they would expand to a much bigger place, as they definitely would benefit from it. I suggest getting the dragon roll or the Vegas roll, which makes a fantastic cold breakfast the next morning."}, {"review_id": "65q41l060aWOnhwEn-T96A", "user_id": "q6U7Wf3JcqLCo9XVByAb2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "This place is amazing!

This is a cute off beat causal yet intimate setting. Seats are limited so reservations are encouraged if you have an event after dinner. My husband had the beef fried rice which was bland. The presentation was nice but the taste is what matters. They were out of miso soup--tacky. I had the albacore, tuna, and fresh salmon nigiri, California roll, and rainbow roll. The fish was fresh so that was a plus. The California roll was wrapped in seaweed which is unusual, the cuts of sushi were sloppy and straggly, the rainbow roll was barely put together. Marc, was the chef and I assume the owner. I expected better when the owner is present."}, {"review_id": "vXOEY1RZGp3NpUMkVOax3w", "user_id": "TMP1A1Li0Y6vCZjY3zhIYQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2017", "text": "Marc's is a strange beast to me... I've been there 3 times and ordered out a handful. It might just be my luck but every time I try to hit this place up there's a 50/50 chance that I'll leave empty-handed. Here's the lowdown:First off, the food as a whole is great. Fried rice is huge, done up right and jammed with meat of your choice and tasty veggies. Sushi rolls are ridiculously sized and delicious - hands down the best sushi value in Rockford. Haven't had much of the hot dishes but what I've had is great. Crab Rangoon is very good but honestly not \"Go there special on Saturday (the only day they have it) and try to show up before they inevitably run out\" good.Now for the bad news: They're closed Sunday and Monday and only open for 2 hours at lunch the rest of the week, then not open again until 5:00. They're packed during all reasonable dining hours on Friday and Saturday due to the small amount of tables and there is no formal seating system, so you just have to kind of stand around in the entryway (which is also surrounded by tables) until someone up and leaves. In some cases it can be a really long wait, though no one is there to tell you that. They don't take reservations. I've tried to go 2 times only to find out when I got there that they were closed for bad weather, even on days that weren't that bad. And one time I tried to get some sushi at lunch but they couldn't sell me any  because they were out of rice and they wouldn't be back in stock until THE NEXT DAY.I get the feeling the owner of Marc's Fusion is an excellent chef and a sub-par business owner. The result is an excellent dining experience, when you can manage to get it. I still consider Marc's the best sushi in Rockford and one of my favorite restaurants, but I just wish they'd work out their flaws so they could be spectacular."}, {"review_id": "mX7Km9bCHnh7azdS0zQ2jA", "user_id": "y9rMk6BMwr7COxTV6YUKzg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/15/2016", "text": "Amazing and fresh sushi but the place is very small, a tip is getting there around the time it opens to avoid waiting for a table-- but I heard they were moving to a bigger location soon-- this should be good!

We get it order in right away: edamame and then three types of maki rolls. Edamame came quickly but the rolls took at least a half hour. This was apparently due to the overload of carry-out orders. I'm still giving the place four stars because the rolls were tasty and not overpriced. We would definitely come back. If you come on a weekend or Friday night You should expect to wait awhile for any sort of sushi: when we went, Marc was the only one making it. Secondly, the reviews that mention huge pieces in the rolls are right. These are the biggest pieces of sushi I've ever eaten in my life and some of them I had to, regrettably, cut in half. My fiancée decided to just bite the bullet and try to take down the huge pieces in one mouthful... I was prepared to give him the Heimlich! But besides being very large, the pieces were tasty.

The sauce provided had a rich, spicy flavor that complemented the texture of the calamari. The sushi itself... all I can say is wow. I ordered the \"Marc's Fusion Roll\" which had a terrific flavor. The ingredients were fresh and served below room temperature, which is an important characteristic for good sushi. The portions were huge too, 10 pieces per order! I could barely finish it, but this sushi is too good to be eaten later.Overall a great experience, one I hope to enjoy again.
