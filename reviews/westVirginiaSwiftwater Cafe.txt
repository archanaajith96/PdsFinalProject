We were on a trip from VA to IN and needed lunch. We stopped at two other places that looked really greasy and unhealthy. We held out and went to Swiftwater and we are so glad we did! The owner was super nice and accommodating. Everyone was friendly and the food came out pretty fast. I had a pesto cracked pepper turkey sandwich and my husband had the pork bbq with slaw. Both were delicious but didn't feel heavy or unhealthy. It's a cute little stop with character, as seen by this wall of fish and photos of fish the family caught. Great food that was reasonably priced, and awesome atmosphere. A must stop if you're in Charleston, WV!"}, {"review_id": "tETNfCcSoK31Ir2Dy7LjpQ", "user_id": "oa41trwew_k8ZfWl4iKIdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/19/2017", "text": "Hubby and I made easy stop off the highway while traveling through the area.  We found the Swiftwater Cafe a good place to get a quick and satisfying lunch.  No off-street parking, so that was a little tricky.   Ended up parking about a half block away.  The Swiftwater is a small place.   We chose to split a Cajun wrap and Cobb salad from their grab and go cooler.  Hubby also ordered chili.   We found all to be fresh and tasty.   The wrap was filled with a variety of ingredients and crispy lettuce.  It came with a mildly spicy dipping sauce.  The Cobb salad had chunks of real chicken, egg, crumbled real bacon, cheese, cucumber, tomato, and a couple of avocado slices.   All was fresh and of reasonable portions.  My husband said the chili was very good....seemed to be made from scratch with chunks of bell pepper and beef.   The grab and go case was a good option for those who are wanting to save time.   However, if you want food made-to-order, we found that ordering from the main menu is the way to do that.  Restrooms were tiny, but clean.  Both gender toilet rooms shared a sink in a little vestibule area, which was right off the kitchen door/dining area and the paper towels and trash can were a couple steps away.  That was a little weird, but they were working with a tight space.  A good lunch.  Nourishing, satisfying.   Better than average, not quite over the top quite yet."}, {"review_id": "BWvRtBiEIfoi-l-scufB0Q", "user_id": "9iFJ9VyxzhLkBg5aGB91Sw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/7/2017", "text": "I dropped in for and early lunch around 11:30 and SO glad I was early today... the line was long by the time I finished eating...

Food always comes out quickly. There are also ready to eat wraps, salads and sides in the cooler. Fountain and bottled drinks. All of the staff are extremely friendly. Lunch is $5-9 but fresh and always quick and correct. Everything I have had has been tasty. They also serve breakfast and have a couple soups of the day. There is seating inside and outside when it is nice. I prefer the hotdog special- 2 hotdogs with your choice of toppings, chips, and a drink for $6. All beef hotdogs and great chili!"}, {"review_id": "aiK-yC_ccLwRuSYnQxGG5w", "user_id": "VQurN_X2HqiP7TBRIbuEtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "Great place for a delicious home-cooked breakfast.

It was the last place I stopped in Charleston before heading back home to Pittsburgh. My boyfriend and I ordered two separate things to split: the southwestern chicken wrap and the pesto turkey sandwich. The wrap was really good, but I'm personally not a cilantro fan and the cucumber salsa they put on the sandwich had cilantro in it. Other than that it was great! But my favorite was definitely the sandwich. The pesto tasted fresh and homemade, and the bread (from Charleston bakery) tastes fresh and homemade. We got a side of pasta salad, which was made with a mayo-base. Normally I don't like mayo-based pasta salad, but this one was out of this world. The only thing better than the food was the service. We were greeted with a very warm welcome when we arrived, and after finishing our meal were asked by two separate people (in a very polite way) if we had had enough and enjoyed our meal. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the area! Next time I come to Charleston, I will definitely be stopping in."}, {"review_id": "PhtptizD6iXmUR13gta9uw", "user_id": "khYL9oD7Ho4cWyqStSP5CA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/12/2016", "text": "I discovered this cafe through Yelp.
