I like how you can create a bowl from various ingredients instead of having to stick with the typical quesadilla, taco, or burrito type of options. However, I do find it extremely difficult to find vegetarian or vegan alternatives on the menu. They offer cauliflower instead of a meat protein, but it appears that is the only non-meat protein on the menu. If you're vegan, you're going to have to make A LOT of variations on the dishes because practically everything comes with either cheese or meat. This is surprising because the other brands within this chain have the Impossible burger or some sort of vegan alternative. However I would say Green Lemon is one of the non-vegan friendly brands within the line-up. You would pretty much have to stick with eat carbs and guacamole at this restaurant."}, {"review_id": "3SxkkvG88WsGA5WJT6MTWg", "user_id": "Ep4gK9Vs0IxRAwsCKLXqQQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Waited over half an hour for a table of 7 and the hostess had a hostile and authoritarian attitude the entire time.

At this point, we were fed up with her rudeness and coldness forwards us and decided to spend our money elsewhere. The manager then told us we could combine the tables, but the dining experience was already beyond saving. I don't know the name of the hostess who was managing tables last night at 7PM, but if the owner or management reads this, please re-train your employees on how to interact with customers because your hostess has embarrassed your restaurant and is a huge risk for Green Lemon's reputation."}, {"review_id": "HOeCFOzOGBVI2DW3iQrjbQ", "user_id": "ib3G5cJBo8Zs7duc_QEG6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I have been coming a Green Lemon for a long time and it is my favorite place to be! Margaritas are amazing, food is great and atmosphere is upbeat and young. The only downside is the wait during high volume times its outrageous. (2-3 hour) They no longer allow call ahead options which is a down point. The customer service is usually average. Last time I called to make a reservation for the next day, the phone was not answered; however, I did receive a call back (). I asked for the reservation and the hostess took the information and placed me on a substantial hold just to tell me \"never mind\" nothing was available.

(Also the owners of daily eats). The name doesn't remind you of Mexican food but omg. The decor is very Rocco's tacos, but very comfy. Servers are efficient and wonderful.Whenever I come I always get the trio dip and chips. It's 10$ for bottomless chips and the dips are queso, lime salsa and spicy guac. Sounds like any other Mexican- American place but these feel super homemade, yes even the cheeesssee!!! It's all a nice and warm and the chips are perfectly fried and flavored.I've eaten many different things here and most everything is customizable too. The most recent time I had two tacos, one skirt steak-4$ and one chicken -3$. The ingredients are simple but plenty and pack some serious flavor. Was just here for a simple lunch but a friend got a frozen margarita with a beer (yes... together in one drink hahahaha). It's beautifully presented and was told it was really good. This would be perfect for more summer time I think. But yaaa know in FL every day is a good day for a nice frozen beer!They have great brunch food and even breakfast. But I'd prefer to come here for lunch time and dinner food. Can't wait to come back and try some more menu items anddddd might need to try all of the margaritas.. just to make sure ;-)"}, {"review_id": "tOZDfyBR3wPr4gVveoUL7Q", "user_id": "5nLsZ3ouFAlysZ8QICEaTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Green lemon is located in the famous Soho or south Howard neighborhood. Specializing in tacos and margaritas as big as your head. Green lemon is definitely a cool hangout on a Friday night. They have a live DJ that's really gives you the feel of a soho bar but one that actually serves good food. You have to make reservation or the wait can be several hours. The tacos here are great! But my new favorite is the fitness bowl. If you are not on a diet don't let the name fool you this bowl is as good as any unhealthy bowl lol and the mojo vinaigrette AMAZING definitely great hangout/ date night option."}, {"review_id": "y-_4Ta5LalAtKIUjnc3glg", "user_id": "Kp-p_FxKVj5me_kEhFQwSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "The green lime is a great example of awesome Mexican cantina food, great service and an eclectic ambiance! For a party of 3 during lunch hour (arrived around 2pm on a holiday) the wait was around 10/15min. The front of house staff were friendly and made sure to seat us right away! The inside has a ton of murals and awesome decor, along with TVs.Our amazing server Melissa got us set up with a couple Coronas (bottles are $4.25 each) and refillable chips and salsa ($3, I definitely recommend the lime salsa!). The salsa tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned chips- put some good chips and salsa in front of me and I have no self control...they're just so good!!!Our entrees came out, my boyfriend ordered the habanero beef fiesta bowl which he was amazed with, and I ordered the Cauliente fiesta bowl. When I got my order I quickly realized that it was way to spicy for me..I couldn't even get through two bites! (What did I think the cauliente would be...caliente? Duh...) even though it was my fault for not asking how spicy it was before I ordered, our server Melissa was AWESOME and quickly got me another bowl with a lot less spice in it! The staff was so accommodating and even took the bowl off my tab for the trouble which I was even more floored since it was my fault for ordering something too spicy! Overall Green Lemon is a great place food wise and service wise, definitely a place to hit up in SoHo!"}, {"review_id": "ZM0meXMhezLsZylFB0Cyrw", "user_id": "3eV2IZYAESkAO-TXsu8Zug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I grew up eating corn on a stick.

They have a private parking lot on the side and the surrounding streets have parallel parking available. The restaurant has a hip and trendy atmosphere with painted murals and eccentric colors all over. One side of the menu has a large selection of Mexican food as well as a list of taco fillings while the other side tells you all about the drinks they have. The happy hour menu is located in a small square box with about a few specials like $4 sangrias, $5 nachos, $8 margaritas, and a taco trio for $8. The nachos are definitely a bang for your buck and a great way to start your meal. It's a huge portion that comes out on a steel tray that is delicious even without meat (which costs a few dollars extra). The ahi tuna filling has fresh fish and avocado that needs a few lime pieces for extra flavor, the carne asade steak was flavorful, and the chicken gigante is basically just buffalo chicken with pieces of lettuce (would not recommend). The drinks are tasty but strong so you'll definitely feel a buzz after just one.Overall, I'd say this is a great happy hour for the portions you get at such reasonable prices."}, {"review_id": "yLYIsY-B7vuHqM-NrE_fSw", "user_id": "66gGJJZqKgLxGLA-IhjheA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We were looking for a place to have brunch before departing back to Miami. My friend suggested Green Lemon. Now I wouldn't usually think Mexican for brunch, but it was definitely a solid choice. The place is cutely decorated and walking in we are welcomed with some live music. Our server was very welcoming and friendly; and the food came out promptly. For starters, we ordered the trio dip, that came with cheese dip, guacamole and fresh salsa. It is a good starter to share while waiting for your food. The chips have a nice seasoning on them too that makes you want to eat the whole darn basket. Now for my meal, I ordered the the breakfast wrap with the cheesy jalapeño grits. Ya gotta get the grits. They were oh so cheesy and just overall yummy. The wrap was good as well, packed with egg, sausage and bacon. Top it with some salsa and it gives it a good flavor. Overall a good Sunday place. I did see lots of people there for football, so that is an option if you want to catch a Sunday game."}, {"review_id": "is93QiqhQo3karPfqV3_SA", "user_id": "IB6n1P091RhK__FU2XIFgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Since my initial review, I've been back twice!

He texted me saying we haven't gone on a lunch or dinner date in a while and I realized I was actually passing his office so I threw out that I was free right away. But my version makes me look like a more caring wife). He immediately responded that he was craving tacos and wanted to go to Green Lemon (this part is true). Since I didn't have any strong opinions I agreed.The parking lot is on the small side, but at 12:15 p.m. on a Thursday I was able to snag the last spot! When we left around 1 p.m. there were many more spots available. Soho parking is no joke so I appreciate this parking no matter how limited it may be. It was pretty busy, but we were seating right away. We started off with chips and salsa (my husband's idea, not mine). Even though he ordered it, I finished it. Those chips are dynamite! The seasoning on it is so addicting. I was scooping around the bowl to find the ones that had the most amount of seasoning. He got the spicy salsa, but I quickly determined it was too spicy for me, so they brought me the mild level. Trying to be somewhat healthy, I went with the seared tuna Fitness Bowl with brown rice. It is a big portion (although I might have been less hungry after inhaling those chips) and left me feeling full and not deprived. It comes with sauce on the side that was delicious, but I found the bowl had enough flavor on its own that I barely used it. It was about $35 for both meals (my husband got a trio of tacos) and the chips plus tip. Not terrible for lunch. I definitely felt like the meal was worth it."}, {"review_id": "jUg9ZG4jqUETapwUSlTYgQ", "user_id": "X26028b-8PmvFyprCfOiWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I just love this place, if you haven't noticed by all my reviews...lolWent in for a quick lunch before a movie, and luckily got there early enough it wasn't too busy yet!  Got parking right up front, and let the staff know we were in a little bit of a hurry to get to the show on time.They were awesome!  Got us our food quickly, and of course it was just as amazing as it always is!  Look, I'm not a fan of tacos...seriously.  My husband on the other hand would get Mexican every day b/c he loves tacos.  So imagine his excitement to have a place that has exactly what he wants and I want to go all the time too.  :p  Happy hubby lotsa lovey!  lolI like that the tacos aren't just normal tacos.  They have bowls and salads, and I always get the tacos there.  My husband isn't as much of a fan of the \"fancy tacos\" as he calls them, but he special requests them to just make the standard taco (ground beef, cheese, lettuce, pico) and they always accommodate!  TIP:We generally ask for the check when we get our food b/c sometimes it can take too long if we wait until we are done eating.  So if you're the type that just likes to eat and leave then keep this in mind."}, {"review_id": "wkSVNGSDSBiIwi86u3LBkg", "user_id": "chCmysfE2qeWxwvrQhMNYA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Okay so.... service is a total disaster.... we went on Tuesday which is understandably busy but the front desk was definitely very sassy and was taking their time getting anyone seated even though there were tons of empty tables around.

Green Lemon is one such place. Tucked into a location on the popular and ever growing dining scene on SoHo, this place was absolutely popping when I went. The music was blasting and the restaurant was lively, my type of place. Now let's dive into the essentials.The food was good. There's a variety of taco choices, ranging from the more traditional like Carne Asada and Carnitas all the way to the eclectic like Buffalo Chicken. Prices for the tacos ranged from $3.50 to about $4.25 depending on type of taco. Although it may appear a bit pricy if you are going the a la carte route, here the tip and game changer: go during happy hour! You can get sets of 3 tacos for $8. Even bigger plus? House margaritas are $6. Taco and margarita? That's a win in my book.Be aware that when a place is busy, service may be a bit slow. But other than that, servers were attentive and kept the glasses full and the chips coming.
