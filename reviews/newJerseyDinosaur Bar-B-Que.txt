I needed to meet my colleague Pete from a prior company for Lunch. Pete works in Newark now. \"I asked him where should we eat?\"I said \"I know you are going to say pizza or Portuguese but I am not in the mood for either\". Pete says \"We must go to Dino BBQ\"I was like \"Huh?\"He's like \"Of course the place is great trust me\". I looked it up on Google and realized it was next to the Devils hockey arena \"The Rock\" and I enjoy going to the Rock eg if it is near the Rock it must be good. Met Pete here great place, fun, great food, nice servers. As you might expect great bbq sauce.  No issues! Shocking!

I've been to most of their locations and never had a bad meal... til now!     Greeted warmly, sat at the bar, drink right away, apps in the oven. I was happy! I ordered the Wango Tango wings. They were delicious. Sauced with their house made Wango Tango sauce which is a nice amount of heat. Very tasty. Maybe a little too much sauce on the wings, but they were delicious.     Change of shift happened, and everything went downhill... I ordered the Tres Ninos. Ribs, brisket, pulled pork. The brisket was very good. Just moist enough. (How many of you cringed when I said moist...ladies?) The pulled pork was decent. The ribs were TERRIBLE! They were burnt beyond recognition. More sauce couldn't even help them. On top of that, the bartender was too busy to ask me once how my meal was tasting. Not even when he pulled my plate away. Then, it took a while for another drink, and the bar wasn't even full.      I've never had service this poor in a Dinosaur BBQ before. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and make another appearance before I write off this location. I will be back, but hopefully they'll clean up their act..."}, {"review_id": "t42MJ_HVlIWnEjfuVmS-jQ", "user_id": "fUnIZ6Z_hy68xjvWipXA7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I had a marginal experience in the past and rated this place at 2-stars.  I've been back a few times since and now it's become my go-to to pregame before Prudential Center events.Everything I've ordered has been pretty solid.  I'd put this at 3.5 stars but, since that's not an option, what the hell . . . 4 stars."}, {"review_id": "YddT5q_YnQqF09-wmGM31A", "user_id": "LslXIOZrJS5guPGMQwEhFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Really good finger licking BBQ.

It's so hard finding a spot that works for both the meat eater an non-meat eater...but this place satisfied us both! To start, the brisket and pulled pork sliders are great. The BBQ sauce was a perfect addition to the soft bread and meat. Next up was the combo platter-more pulled pork (choice is yours) and shrimp with mashed potatoes (gravy held) and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese...delish!! Note that everything here seems to have a spicy kick to it, and I love spicy! The shrimp and even their cocktail sauce was on point! Now, here's the part where I enjoyed my meal. I ordered the BBQ Smoked Porto Sandwich...let me just say that my taste buds and portobello mushrooms are coming around. It was either that or one of their yummy sounding salads. Salads are my go to when there is nothing else on the menu, but boy am I glad I tried the Porto sandwich with a side of whipped sweet potatoes. The bbq mayo on the sandwich was a hit with the mushroom, zucchini, onions and peppers. The sweet potatoes...I spooned the bowl clean! They were sweet and spicy. I've never had a sweet potatoes with a kick, but these worked!The alcoholic drinks...We both had the Donkey Punch then I tried the White Lemonade...both were good. Very convenient to the Prudential Center...in fact, that's why we're here. We parked at our hotel (next to the venue) then walked to the restaurant. Give them a try when I'm the area!We were there on a Saturday afternoon a little after  3.

The brisket was REALLY good, and I highly recommend it to anyone who goes. It was so soft but juicy enough to just melt in your mouth. The wings on the otherhand wasn't good at all and I don't recommend it to anyone who goes. It wasn't flavorful at all but was just plain hot and burned my mouth LOL. The beans are definitely a MUST!!

I met up with a friend who came into town for work and we started our day getting some lunch here.  We were both pretty hungry and both in the mood for ribs so we wound up getting the Sweetheart deal for 2.  Always a good time when good decisions are made.We got there pretty early in the day so naturally our food came quickly, which is always a great start. The ribs were excellent as well as the sides. I particularly liked the greens although my friend didn't and wanted them to be more vinegary. I'm sure if they were I'd still have liked them.  I was a lil disappointed at the habanero BBQ sauce, not because it didn't taste great, but because I was hoping that there was more heat. I didn't feel anything... . Maybe I'm just too tolerant for that sauce.  My friend was especially pleased with the 1/2 pints, as she likes to be able to try more beers without getting too full.  (Tip: The Victory Golden Monkey went really well with the ribs.)All in all, great food and staff made it a delicious experience.  Looking forward to more tasty ribs!"}, {"review_id": "q3dwgYuRjj7HNN2W3Qk2Kw", "user_id": "KR3Re1F5m02Y531H1YeMyA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "ONLY RESTAURANT I HAVE WALKED OUT ON IN MY LIFE - HIGHLY DISORGANIZED - POSSIBLY RACISTI was a frequent diner at the Dinosaur BBQ in Harlem so now that I live in Jersey, decided to give this location a shotArrived at 2:08 PM on a Saturday and my wife went in to get a number, surprisingly after about 5 minutes of waiting she came out and told me that the wait was only 15 minutes.  So we waited a bit and after about 15 minutes I went in with my kids.  I got in and saw there was a good amount of people there in and around the door area.  I spoke with my wife and she said we would get paged when it was our turn.  Within minutes, the hostess came up to me and told me that the waiting area was in back.  It might've been a coincidence that I was the only one there that was Asian...but there was literally like 20 people in and around the front.  Why was I the only person singled out to go to the back behind the bar area.Anyhow I thought it best not to piss off the person deciding who gets seated and we went back there and waited.  So far it had already been about 30 minutes of waiting when we were originally told 15 minutes.While we were waiting I observed that the service was reallllly slow for those that were already seated.  Like they literally were there for 15 minutes without a single person coming by to take their order.  And others who finished their entire meal before getting french fries.Finally I decided that we should just go eat elsewhere because even if we were seated it would take at least 30 minutes to get food..AT LEAST.  So i walk to the front where my wife was waiting and said lets just go.  But she said the hostess said that we were next.  But instead of seating us, they then seated 3 tables ahead of us.  1 table had just arrived 10 minutes prior with a party of 7.  The only african american group waiting.  Anyhow they finally seat us at 3:05 PM.  They seated us in the table furthest in the back where the kitchen was.At this point I had to go out to the meter to put more money in as I had only bought a 1 hour parking limit on the timer.  When I came back, there was still no server...Then a guy that you couldn't even tell was a waiter started taking orders of the table of 7 that had arrived just 10 minutes prior.  He took maybe 10 minutes to finish up that order.During the whole time we were seated near the kitchen...NOT 1 FOOD ORDER WENT OUT.  This lady was there yelling I NEED A RUNNER.  FOR LITERALLY THE ENTIRE TIME.  Seriously, do you not know where the tables are?  You can't bring the food out or something.  The food was probably already cold...So then the waiter continued taking orders, but not in the order that people were seated.  Just from the front of the house to the back. And because we were in the way back, people that seated after us were getting their orders taken.At this point we were fed up, our kids were starving, it had been over an hour and we hadn't even gotten our orders taken.  We were not down to wait maybe 10+ minutes for the only waiter in the place to slowly get to us.  I can't even imagine how pissed I wouldve been, if they sat another group between us and the front of the house...When we finally got up to leave, a runner finally arrived to bring out the food.  Thank god Chipotle was next door, as they were fast and even threw in some free chips because they knew our kids were hungry from waiting so long.Love the food at Dinosaur BBQ but man they need better management as their employees are a reflection of their leadership.  If the wait is clearly over 30 minutes, don't tell people it'll only be 15 minutes.  If you work there day in and day out, you have to be an idiot to be that far off your estimate."}, {"review_id": "NSWYsurRKi4wU-mTxFwLlQ", "user_id": "V5AsoF06KAsuqqMFqsxglA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "Food is just above middle of the line bbq which is probably the best you'll be able to find in the area.

Clearly they are mismanaged as far as the food management goes. Instead I ordered the 2 meat combo BBQ pulled pork and Korean BBQ ribs with coleslaw and whipped sweet potatoes. A few minutes later the waiter came back and said they don't have Korean ribs either. I was like \"really\"? What BBQ place runs out of their main BBQ meat items. It wasn't a good experience for my first dining there. The food tasted sub par anyway and was not impressed with the St. Louis ribs and pulled pork.

That pork had some nice bark pieces, shredded perfectly, very flavorful and tender, a great match with their coleslaw.  Brisket and chicken were both nicely moist and A-OK. Pork ribs were slathered in sauce, falling off the bone, yummy. Side of gumbo was mixed with rice, not memorable or recommended. Also not a fan of the beer-boiled peel-and-eat shrimp that are delivered cold to the table, over cooked and excessively bland.About a dozen drafts, a mix of macro-brews and NJ micro-brews. Didn't get the happy hour deets tho. On a relatively quiet Tuesday night Dino BBQ was all out of the Korean beef ribs, kitchen fail I guess. Some service fail too, it was surprisingly difficult to get beers, then when our food finally showed some was wrong and the fries were stone cold. Our man made it right eventually.Noisy but manageable, adult conversation possible. On a warm night they have picnic tables outside, be sure to ask bcos they don't seem to mention it at the host stand.Vegetarian rating: 1 star, stay away!
