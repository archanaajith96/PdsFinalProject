La Campinara serves authentic Mexican cuisine at a reasonable price. The menu allows for a variety of combinations with traditional dishes. Vegetarian friendly too! I would highly recommend their fish tacos and elote en vaso. Don't snooze on their smoothies and juices either! La Campinara is one of the best restaurants in the tri-state area.

Obviously returning repeatedly for that smoothie means I love it. The staff is always friendly and helpful.But the food I have found to be bland. First time I went for lunch and had one of the tiny little pork tacos (which was ok) but not realising they were so tiny, I had only ordered one. Then I took my husband there for dinner. We shared a torta (which was ok but nothing special) and each had our own tamale (also ok but nothing special).I'm mystified at all the glowing reviews. And I expected that an authentic Mexican restaurant with five stars on Yelp would have seriously excellent tamales, but La Campirana does not. Don't get it."}, {"review_id": "DqXloVdzAYSOiw7VC9Ti6A", "user_id": "oxNMIUED0MQ6M23IR9IuvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "If you have to choose only one restaurant in Evansville then this is the one. There is not a single resturaunt in this city that can compare on levels of friendliness, value, and flavor. They use to be located in Washington Square Mall but have since moved to this new location which is a nice size building with a separate juice bar area. Menu has plenty to choose from and even after nine or visits I am still working my way through it. The tacos, quesadilla and gordita are all fantastic but right now I am hooked on the burrito. You will be hard pressed to find a better and more authentic Mexican restaurant unless you are heading down South.

I was very happy to see a place like this being really busy in Evansville and hope it sticks around! I got 3 tacos - carnita, al pastor, and chorizo. The stand out for me was the chorizo taco. I like the option of different sauces at the salsa bar. I really wish they had tostadas, but I was happy with the tacos! I would have gotten a side, but they were priced a little high. I definitely see myself returning in the future!"}, {"review_id": "nR8batJy4IeOrfw8NjsDTw", "user_id": "LQSTOG6Auz9Ld0O7fDbMBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "The food was great.

My daughter and I are Mexican food snobs having lived in Tucson for 20 years and I've had to lower my standards for what authentic really means in the Midwest. This place gave me hope! It's the real deal! The set-up is a bit weird but the food is spot on! We both ended up getting tamales and were not disappointed! They were actually tamales! Not the pile of ground beef mush you get at other local Mexican restaurants! And the street tacos look like real street tacos! This will, for sure, be my go-to whenever I'm in town so I can get my fix of true authenticity!!"}, {"review_id": "pcjiBZboMwoD7cl6KDQZZg", "user_id": "Y0mEYxDfGSfsXVWtcUXpwQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "A sure bet.You order at the counter and wait for food while standing or sitting at a table.  With this setup we expected fast service but waited 10-15 minutes.  In all fairness it was a busy Friday evening...Atmosphere:  clean, decent decoration, high ceilings, open one year at this location.  Tables kept clean, open window into kitchen which also looked neat.Food: excellent variety of taco, burrito, enchilada, chalupa, offered w various flavorings of chicken/steak/pork meats.  You choose whether sour cream, guacamole or pico de gallo is added, also a small condiment bar for sauces.  Good flavor on burrito and birria that we had.  I don't know how authentic food is but what we saw and had was great.  Quantity was about normal so we didn't crave dessert.There is a separate room and seating for dessert items - good idea!Smoothies and fruit drinks were tempting but for $5 we'll just make our own at home.Service: efficient at taking orders, friendly, but some waiting after ordering.Price: okay.  It's on par w a sit down meal."}, {"review_id": "e9qqOgk6-rTDi2l8X74B4A", "user_id": "Oczs8WWm45yVWdn6M32h6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "This is my favorite place to eat while in Evansville.
