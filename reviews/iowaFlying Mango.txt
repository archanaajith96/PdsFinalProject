We actually pulled up to the place and at first glance were not blown away by the location or appearance, we decided to leave. Well after driving around we had a change of heart and decided to return.Best decision we made that day. It turned out to be in our opinion a hidden gem. The atmosphere was really cozy. A great place to unwind relax and enjoy some really good southern comfort food with a twist. Not what we expected! Not to mention the owner's hospitality, his passion for good food and the friendly staff & guest. A real treat. Please try the Smoke Chicken App my favorite. But here you can't go wrong. Overall a great experience. We decided to make Des Moines a once a year getaway just to visit this place and a few good distant friends."}, {"review_id": "I17mavh-x-VcNebHGfaXdg", "user_id": "pCfmOxspdenRELKLxUejaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Great BBQ and local atmosphere.

This was the most amazing dinner I've had in a while. The peeling paint on the outside is no indication of the surprise  you find on the inside. We arrived early on a Tuesday night with no reservations. We were seated in the back room. Our server brought our water and drinks quickly. She quickly walked us through the specials and menu.  I ordered the brisket salad as a healthy option ($18). I received a huge portion of the most tender flavorful juicy brisket smothering a delicious bed of fresh young greens and surprising treat of peanuts.  The salad was gently coated with an light vinaigrette.  The salad included a wedge of cornbread. I think this was the best salad I've ever eaten. One table mate enjoyed the Redneck platter composed of blackened catfish, ribs with sides. The other table mate enjoyed the special of pork shanks over Gorgonzola grits with corn bread.  His dinner was so good that it left him wanting more. There was a line waiting for seats when we left. Recommend reservations or coming very early. This place is worth the 7 hour drive. I will be back."}, {"review_id": "8WGKm1qK5ltj9_DPQCR-bA", "user_id": "8HHaDchvpG2KBtjItvSe6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Flying Mango never disappoints. This small restaurant is a Des Moines treasure. It's hard to classify exactly what genre it falls into. Their take on BBQ is refreshingly different from the more common smokehouse style. I've visited a half dozen times in the last few months and have tried a different dish each time.

The wait wasn't too long and was able to order a drink while we waited. Was a bit confused by drink menu when ordering as there were multiple of the same drinks marked at different prices. We were seated in the back which even though was crowded was quite cozy. I questioned our server about the multiple prices for the same drink and she indicated they would get it taken care of. We ordered ribs and the blackened catfish. I was really hoping for grits but they only had goat cheese grits and that just wasn't happening. My husband loved loved loved his ribs he still talks about them. My catfish was way too mushy and hard to stomach. After wrapping up dinner we received the bill to see my multipriced wine was billed at a higher cost then the 2 listed prices on the drink menu. They did adjust it to the higher of the 2 on the menu but still kinda crappy.

I went with my husband and my mom, who is usually not impressed by restaurants here in the US, she is an even more demanding diner than I am, so I was a bit nervous to try Flying Mango. We went on a Friday night so it was absolutely packed, but we called ahead so our wait was only 15 minutes. Just the atmosphere was fantastic, all abuzz, kind of a big city feel and also the wonderful smells coming from the kitchen area. I loved that you could see the kitchen in action! My mom and I split a the 24 hour brisket dish, with the cornbread  (and delicious cinnamon butter) and the collard greens. What a wonderful decision! I really like brisket, but honestly, Flying Mango's is in a completely different league. Beautifully cooked, melts in your mouth, smokey but not overpowering, flavors on point and excellently complemented by the greens and the cornbread. Hands down, best brisket I have had in the Midwest, and a pretty legitimate contender to The Salt Lick in Texas. Des Moines should be proud of this gem! Service was prompt, attentive and friendly. This place also has a nice beer selection, I had a lager from Brazil I really enjoyed. If you haven't already experienced the Flying Mango, what are you waiting for?!? You will be so glad you did. I can't wait to return. If you are  on a budget, save up some $$ and then treat yourself!"}, {"review_id": "8kTOUsm8U4zgbvwwmAK_Rw", "user_id": "QWkMoZSt0dVUBXLoTSdPHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "This has been on our list of places to try for almost two years now, and we finally made it in. We went in around 5:30 on a Friday night, and got in right before the crowd started to form. I would highly recommend getting a reservation! Our service was great. Our server was kind, knowledgeable, and FAST. She refilled our water a few times so quickly that we didn't even notice her. She was top-notch! My husband enjoyed his ice water while I tried a citrus hibiscus mule, which was one of their signature cocktails that night. We ordered mussels for an appetizer, hubby got the rubs, and I got a brisket sandwich. For dessert, we gave the bread pudding a whirl. Citrus Hibiscus Mule- A perfect drink for summer, and if you like tea (especially hibiscus tea), you will love this. It was subtle and not overly sweet, while not being bitter at all either. I loved it.Mussels- These were good. The butter sauce was delicious, and it's a decent amount of mussels. The bread that comes with it was well toasted and perfect for sopping up the sauce. I just with it came with more than two little pieces of bread though.Ribs- My husband really liked these. They had a good char on them, and covered in the house sauce (OMG), they were gone pretty fast. The potato of the day was mashed and they were excellent as well. The star of his meal though was the cornbread though, which was SO GOOD, it gets its own special review.CORN BREAD- You HAVE to get the corn bread. It is hands-down the best corn bread either of us have every had. It was thick, dense, and moist, something that many corn breads miss the mark on. The cinnamon honey butter takes it almost into the dessert realm. Next time, I might just order a million slices of this bread and die fat, covered in butter, and oh-so happy. Brisket Sandwich- Put away your knives, folks. The brisket is so tender it literally flakes with a fork. Flying Mango makes a bomb.com sauce that is perfect on top of it. My only issue is that, even with a ton of sauce, the sandwich is a bit dry. The bread they use is a drier roll in nature. I would suggest adding some mayo/butter/other topping on the side with their sandwiches to help in that department. White Chocolate Bread Pudding- Buttery, thick, yummy. The mango puree is unexpected but adds a nice acid to the dish. The white chocolate gets a little lost in the fray, though. However, still loved it and ate every bite!We had all of this food AND were in and out in about 35 minutes! We never felt rushed, and I loved that the kitchen is open so you feel like you are part of the establishment. We are looking forward to coming back soon!"}, {"review_id": "iUWoq-ihMJgw-wzwK3kCxw", "user_id": "IMYZYtOsoQKD4CRgL4DXuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2017", "text": "We've wanted to try this place out for months and it lived up to our expectations! I can't remember the last time we ate every bit of the food off our plates  We arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation so we sat and had drinks in the waiting area. Once seated we were quickly greeted by our very friendly and attentive waitress. We went with the appetizer special, catfish cakes. We were starving and ate them before I remembered to take a picture. Great flavor! They were served on a bed of mixed greens.For our main entrees I had the triggerfish and my bf had the beef brisket. Neither of us shared so I'm assuming both were amazing! I had never had triggerfish but it was light and flaky, matching well with the veggies and mango salsa. We also had a side of cornbread with honey cinnamon butter. Our dessert was the white chocolate bread pudding. I loved the bread pudding, wish it had been a little warmer. The mango syrup was good but didn't seem to pair as well and the cold temperature didn't work for me so I ate without the syrup. Still the perfect conclusion to our meal!We will definitely be back! The prices make it a special occasion restaurant but I enjoyed every bite, the atmosphere, and extremely friendly service!"}, {"review_id": "og7T66dni1ow9ozawZCcXw", "user_id": "acnFZaWmTC913XgMNJY3GA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "One of Des Moines best.

I had the special which was chicken breast topped with goat cheese and asparagus with a side of smoked Gouda potatoes. The chicken was weird and spongy and did not look like or have the texture of a natural chicken breast. It was also served cut up. What is this? A nursing home? I can cut my own food. Except for my chicken, the rest my food was cold. It had obviously sat while the other order was cooking. My boyfriend got the brisket sandwich with a side of chicken Creole. While it's nice that they will do chicken Creole as a side my boyfriend said everything was meh. The service was fine but lackluster. We got our drinks, we got our food, we got our bill. That's about it. I doubt we'll be back, especially with all the other BBQ places opening up in DSM.
