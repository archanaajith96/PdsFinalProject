I was in Shreveport visiting a friend and we decided to try this place. This restaurant was the culinary highlight of my trip. I seriously LOVED everything I ordered. The pictures doesn't do the dishes any justice. Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. I was blown away by the corn on the cobb . The cornbread made me want to go hide under the table and stuff my face like seriously it was that good. I'd definitely recommend this place"}, {"review_id": "MztwuY_8QeZklnLl1mGNQg", "user_id": "oZcaA8Wgv762u51W54oTRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Great crawfish ettouffee and amazing fried catfish.

In town on business and this was a quick walk from the Hilton. The aged ribeye was superb, cooked to perfection and so tender you almost didn't need the knife. The corn on the cob is one of the most unique creations I've had in a pub well worth the stop alone. We paired this with their signature cocktail and after two drinks and a fantastic meal we stumbled home fat and happy. The quality you receive here is well worth the price. If you stop by I recommend trying this place. It was far superior to the Saltgrass we visited last night."}, {"review_id": "Ccf7GL3gJXxO6rWyk84HhA", "user_id": "RPmAhKboQbLmnHoPSalxUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great food and drink prices.

Immediately turned away by the hostess that they are closed but we could go sit at the bar and have a beer. Would be great to properly advertise your hours and let local hotels know so they don't send potential customers to a disappointment. Seemed even more odd with the amount of people actually in there dining, which begs the question regarding the integrity of hours open? I understand getting someone 5 minutes before closing would suck but at least make an effort with over 30 minutes or post notice accordingly."}, {"review_id": "nmVO9bODMLGUpzr3bUaUGg", "user_id": "4WKkFDIyGwm9bUqoZuyirQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Awesome food and service.   Downtown Shreveport bossier.  Authentic Cajun food and drinks.

The patty itself was pretty thin, not your typical hearty chicken sandwich. Honest Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich was more filling and had better flavor. I would have liked more than one chunky tomato slice (possibly a few thin slices to enjoy with the entire sandwich) and dill pickle slices instead of that one sliver of pickle. I traded my fries for a fried corn and wowzers, that was a fantastic decision. I never had fried corn on the cob before, but I'll never eat corn the same. I will definitely order a different main dish next time, but will add at minimum 2 fried corns."}, {"review_id": "OmpEeQQm3tvhP3s8VqMPJA", "user_id": "EycZjJS9DH2wNNPa3wbGIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/3/2017", "text": "Ok.

It's just never been my taste. However, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Blind Tiger.Our server was super friendly and very helpful with recommendations. He asked about our spice tolerance before we ordered our meals and made sure we would like what we got. I ended up getting the jumbo shrimp and catfish plate (subbed fries with jambalaya), and my friends got the Cajun platter. Their gumbo (gumbeaux?) came out first and the spoonful or two I had of it was super good - gumbo I've had in the past has tended to smell too much like the ocean, but this one didn't (probably because they didn't put crawfish in it).I really enjoyed my meal - the jumbo shrimp was perfectly crispy, and the catfish didn't taste muddy or too heavily battered. My food came with tartar and cocktail sauce which I enjoyed. The jambalaya was delicious as well.The food came out quickly enough that we didn't get impatient, but took enough time that we knew they were cooking to order.If you want good Cajun food in the Shreveport area, go to Blind Tiger!"}, {"review_id": "zZDTQuU4NPyA1-lVRn6W8g", "user_id": "GwCcOcTD7WWel22mB2_DzA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/25/2017", "text": "They serve a menu of cajun favorites in a dated, pub-like setting with dark woods and low lighting.

Servers are suggestive and offer real opinions based on personal or other patron's feedback.The menu and it's selections are nothing new, however where Blind Tiger shines is (going to sound crazy) is in seasoning and taste.
