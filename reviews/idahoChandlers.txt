Of course I've reviewed them! I've been here a million times!Except, I never did. SO HERE GOES! An aggregate review of Chandler's over the course of \"a million times.\"I'll start by saying that we've had snafus there. One time, a hostess spilled a cape codder on my wife's wedding dress (we came here for dinner and a room on the night of our wedding). They made it right. That's the most notable faux pas, but I'm sure there have been one or two minor ones.That said, this place:-Makes my favorite Vespa Martini;-Has tremendously flavorful appetizers, like their tower of tun and escargot a la carole (LOVE);-Has a stellar wine list;-Hires professional and knowledgeable servers, especially their sommeliers;-Is a Boise institution (and, in my experience, has better steak than comparable joints that claim to be better).My one major complaint, which is probably difficult to control, are the people who come in. In two instances, we've encountered the following scenario: we are seated next to very drunk people; one of them is wearing gym shorts and a t-shirt or hoodie (male); the other one is dressed like a \"lady of the night\" (female); they talk graphically and loudly about said profession, often in gory detail.Dress code? Kick people out over foul language? Believe me when I say I believe in your non-right to hire out a sexual partner, but maybe comport yourself like a non-asshole while in a non-sexual mode?We can't end on that note: CHANDLER'S IS, INDEED, A BOISE INSTITUTION! COME HERE AND HAVE AN AMAZING STEAK OR SOME EXCELLENTLY COOKED FISH!!"}, {"review_id": "N0yS-IRoxLMUlAvBUz4nxw", "user_id": "JoWfzwHD7EWcOt1mT02scg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Best steak in Boise, and awesome menu overall. The ambiance is a bit...tired. Not in a distressed way, but definitely feels like it's in a hotel. That said, the service is usually top-notch, the steak is consistent, the lobster bisque is the best I've ever had, and the wine selection is unique for Boise!Let me clarify (in response to the owner's comment on my review): the restaurant is impeccably clean, very modern, and generally pretty pleasurable, as far as overall vibe goes. It's just not one of the most amazing, unique-feeling dining rooms I've eaten in. I'm aware that the restaurant is not affiliated with the hotel. The food is usually great, and the service is usually great too. No complaints, really. My second favorite steak in all of Idaho, which says a lot. I've had very few issues at Chandlers, and I've probably eaten at here 30+ times - it's always a must-visit recommendations for visitors to Boise."}, {"review_id": "Dp2QsaXTt73DriNYdY0bew", "user_id": "9sYqKAURMWJId5R2Oo8tDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "We always have a wonderful time at Chandler's. Upon arrival, the staff was vastly helpful and kind. I noticed all who work there are very knowledgeable and pleasant. The lounge was extremely elegant and stylish. I enjoyed the dimmed lighting and delicious Martinis. I opted for the \"Ten Minute Martini\" and some delicious Chardonnay. We went on Valentines Day and enjoyed the live music. I'm not sure if they always have live music but it was a lovely touch."}, {"review_id": "VaRTbkorYHzSOoViWh1tpA", "user_id": "bQ15foSCndZg5vF3KrEuZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Really good. Downstairs of Hotel 43 this place was very elegant and swanky. Nice big bar, live music every night, recommend a reservation. Started with a glass of white wine, followed with delicious Lilly pop chops off the bar menu and had the seafood salad for dinner it was the right amount of food.

Most versions served these days seem to forget they're supposed to include anchovies. Chandler's Caesar included them in the dressing and as individual pieces. I think filet mignon just isn't made for me. I prefer a rib steak or porterhouse to the filet. What they served me seemed fine. I just don't appreciate the way others do.I had a bite of a friend's lamb chop and it was excellent. I would order that if I returned. Three people in our group, including me, had recent or upcoming birthdays. They brought us a chocolate soufflé cake, complete with extra chocolate sauce and whipped cream. Oh, and a candle.That was in addition to the dessert included with dinner. Both were excellent, although I had to bring most of The Bomb home.Service was friendly and attentive the entire evening. Great experience for my first time at one of Boise's finest restaurants."}, {"review_id": "k7AXWTXOK2SDkJ8ktOzb-A", "user_id": "6jwzAVnq-0QeHhFZzO4Txw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Great steakhouse environment and meal - cant go wrong making Chandlers a stop when in Boise.

Way too long for us to be gone.But, I am glad to say that Chandler's still is upholding their great reputation and food. Service remains top notch. Their Sunday night crowd was jammed, right from the get-go. Prime rib was a hot item, fixed price dinner, and was gone almost from the start. One of our party got the last one. We did learn one thing about the prime rib, they cook two prime ribs so there only 4 end cuts. So if that is your thing, like me, call in early for a 5:30 reservation and ask for dibs on and end cut. The rest of the prime rib is done medium rare, so if you want it done more, tell the server to let them know in the kitchen.For appetizers, we went with escargot and abalone. The abalone is market price and farmed, I would guess, but still worth the price. The escargot were also yummy.Now, normally Chandler's would cry out-STEAK!!! But tonight a couple of us had the fixed price Petrale sole and were well pleased by the fish dish. The fixed price dinners come with a soup/salad and dessert. With valet parking, Chandler's is still the best restaurant in Boise."}, {"review_id": "aDWA_amTe-AI0_QkvbNweA", "user_id": "8yjGIa9pv2AWaWqxlt4DDA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "On April 19, 2018 we celebrated my daughter's 16th birthday. She picked Chandlers. Clearly we have raised her right. The service in general was what I have come to expect from a great steak restaurant. After our meals, the wait staff brought out a chocolate souffle birthday dessert with lit candle, which we didn't order (we brought our own birthday cake dessert). It was surprising, and what I thought was a nice, complementary touch.  Everything was great up until we got our check. We were charged 5 dollars per person (7 of us) to plate a slice of the cake we brought, which I get. But, we were also charged for this birthday chocolate souffle, which seemed tacky. Also, I ordered the prix fixe, which included dessert, which I never got. Its this nickel and diming and lack of attention to detail where some of the Chandlers lustre seems to have been lost."}, {"review_id": "SqKm10OUV30pIsL3pwzxpQ", "user_id": "X66bhlWD0r9VjTQB3140qQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/30/2017", "text": "We had a great night at Chandlers.

The food was delicious, perfectly prepared and extra tasty. I  have never had a tuna tower that was so perfectly balanced. I ordered steak with a scallop on the side,  and my daughter ordered the lobster.  The seafood items were extraordinary in both freshness and flavor ! I almost never order dessert but the food was so phenomenal I could not resist the chocolate soufflé , good decision, it was delicious!The wine list was wonderful. The ten minute martini was perfect. Our service was warm and wonderful! The sommelier was very good and unpretentious.  Ambiance was beautiful. On Sunday nights they have live music, the saxophone player hit  just the right note (not overbearing) and added to our enjoyment of the evening.I don't remember the last time I was so thrilled with a restaurant."}, {"review_id": "oDv27HHQ3yMvQYolLZs2TA", "user_id": "Bvnv0Wc8U6Hc7xUmV0R5IA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Chandlers is the best spot in Boise downtown for fine dining!

I have always heard Chandlers was good. I had only been there for drinks, and an appetizer or two in the past. The holiday weekend this year found me there twice. The first visit I felt like fish, because I had had beef for a week straight. I know going to Chandlers and having fish...I get it. The Sea Bass was fantastic. Cooked just right. Came with fingerling potatoes, and a nice Cesar salad.Second visit blew all of us away. I had the ribeye steak. I was the most Delicious, tender, perfectly cooked steak I have ever had. That is saying a lot folks..... It came with the most delicious scalloped potato, and a arugula/burratta cheese salad. Everyone at our table raved about their specific meals as well. They have a great wine list, albeit, a little pricey. The varietals from Napa/Sonoma were considerably marked up. We brought 2 bottles of wine, and we were charged $20.00 corkage. A little steep, but I get it.The service was on point, and the atmosphere is as good as a top notch SF, or NY restaurant.If you  want a true dinning experience, go to Chandlers."}, {"review_id": "bANBfVkAYcpZB2AT29Wqpw", "user_id": "PsDyrj9eF0MpT8r-lnRHAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Visiting from Los Angeles and was looking for a good steak. My friends have been wanting to try Chandlers so we gave it a try. Great atmosphere and the food was amazing. I had the Gold cut filet mignon which was amazing. Melted in my mouth. Needed no steak sauce and could cut it with my butter knife. My friends had cowboy cut Ribeye, and fish and they loved them! Our waiter Trey was extremely helpful with ordering food along with wine suggestions. Finished meal off with a new dessert of bourbon ice cream on a brownie with white and milk chocolate and bacon to top it off. Not a huge bacon fan on desserts but this was by far the best dessert I have ever had. I am looking forward to going back."}, {"review_id": "XSX7obZT_Rkhc7VU_QBGnQ", "user_id": "MKRti9lD-uDUPDRTH2jtzA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "Great ambience with the lighting and live music.

We didn't try any desserts, but a few of the options looked damn good.
