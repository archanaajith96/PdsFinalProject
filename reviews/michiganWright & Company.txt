Great ambiance and definitely a cool vibe in downtown Detroit. I booked a table for about 15 people to celebrate my graduation and it was such an amazing experience (they only take reservations for very large parties and there is a minimum spend). The food is meant to be shared so I ordered just a ton of different small plates for the table so people did not have to individually order. This worked out so well and everyone was happy! My favorite items: fresh potato chips, Maine crab cakes, burrata toast, roasted cauliflower, the scallops, and the night I was there they had a swordfish special that was amazing! For dessert, I loved the chocolate Whoopie pies and the butterscotch pudding was to die for. For drinks we mostly did wine, but I had an amazing cocktail with gin (not sure what it was called)!All in all, had a fantastic experience and will absolutely be returning."}, {"review_id": "nPh6W3WS7FB2bob0xoY2eg", "user_id": "PXt9Q0ZcMsZWmdeVFZa1wA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Loved everything about this place.

Has a great vibe and attentive staff.  We got a couple happy hour drinks which were great a good price. We ordered calamari which was one of the best i have had and burrata crostini. The guy next to us got loaded potato's chips and was moaning they were so good so we ordered that too. Honestly did not disappoint. They were absolutely perfect. Great balance of cheese, scallions, cheese sauce and tomato relish that was a bit sweet and balanced the dish...outstanding!!  Definitely a great place but fills up quickly.

Just wow. Wright & Company is a hip restaurant featuring tapas style dining with expected sharing of food... and it's a great thing they do because you truly should be trying multiple items on their menu. Entering the restaurant is a bit unique as you enter a building, take an elevator to the second floor, then enter a beautiful dining area with high tin ceilings, exposed brick, and a rustic-industrial aesthetic. We were quickly taken to our table (although I understand during many days there is a significant wait as they do not take reservations at this time), and presented menus. Service came promptly to take our drink orders and explain the menu overall. Our server also explained that their cocktail menu changed frequently, but I will say my drink was fabulous and was truly unique, not just a new flavor to a standby or something of the like. To the food. The food was amazing and far above my expectations. Well plated and just incredible, we had the following:+ Duck and Chicken Liver Parfait - One of the highlights of the night. The duck and chicken spread was absolutely delicious and the smooth texture was beautifully accompanied by that various toppers - very well presented as well.+ Roasted Cauliflower - A great dish that was well spiced and a step up from the traditional cauliflower side dish. This is definitely a must if you have any vegetarians.+ Pork Belly Sliders - While good, these are exactly what they sounded like. The pork belly was pretty good, but to be honest, if I return, I probably won't reorder this.+ Seared Bay Scallops - A very respectable and delicious dish. The bay scallops are the smaller cousins of the sea scallops, but still quite sweet and well presented with great finishes to round out the dish.+ Chicken Pot Pie - Probably my least favorite dish of the night. Not to say it wasn't good, but I found the bread slightly dry and without flaky crust, it was missing the typical best part of chicken pot pie. The \"filling\" was quite good, but we needed more sauce to balance all of the breads+ Gulf shrimp - While it is not the most unique dish, it was absolutely delicious. Lightly fried with very sweet gulf shrimp, this was one of my favorites of the night. Bottom line, this place is an absolute gem. I look forward to my next visit to the restaurant and am eager to try new cocktails on the menu and to try the other dishes as well. If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and try to get in if you can!"}, {"review_id": "Hs97Ry6wc3QzQdcZq8VPRg", "user_id": "4jPsIgMZT4_Ks5-myaW9Bg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/25/2017", "text": "I have a theory that the more hidden the location, the better it is (hence the highly esteemed hidden gems). The way to Wright & Co. cannot be more ambiguous--through a stairway in an alley or via a touchscreen elevator with a nondescript entrance marked with nothing more than a sign on the sidewalk--so I had an intuition that it would exceed expectations. The ambiance inside is trendy, classy, and divey all at once. With tall ceilings, marble tables, crimson colored booths, and dim lighting with sparkling vintage chandeliers, it almost looks like it could belong in one of those mansion backdrops in Taylor Swift music videos.It's tapas style and the menu consists of small plates. In my experience, 3 plates between 2 people is sufficient because the food can be quite filling. Portion sizes vary quite a bit; the shrimp came in a heaping pile while the roasted cauliflower looked like a neatly arranged appetizer.  It's on the pricier side, but well within the range you'd expect for a fancy gastropub.The drinks are conveniently organized from lightest on top to strongest on the bottom. Because of the server's recommendation, my own gravitation towards whiskey based cocktails, and my amusement with the name, I got the MISUNDERSTOOD GENIUS ($12) (ranked the most alcoholic). It was perhaps my favorite part of the dining experience here; it is deliciously strong with Monkey Shoulder scotch but balanced and nuance with a touch of sweetness from Fino sherry and tartness from black lime syrup. My friends got TENDER IS THE NIGHT ($11; Brugal Anejo, goji berry, lime cordial, Byrrh) which was good, but smelled odd partly because of the orchid garnish.Yes, laugh at the millennial toast craze, but I was pleasantly impressed by the BURRATA TOAST ($12) which consisted of a mini toast under a disproportionately large mound of burrata. I liked the bold emphasis on the fresh, creamy burrata, enhanced by the pine nut brittle maple glaze and micro greens.The ROASTED VEGETABLE SALAD ($11) is an embellished warm winter salad, with green beans, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and crisp chickpeas topped with sundried tomato vinaigrette and garlic yogurt dressing. In my opinion it is a bit tiring after awhile since there's so much of the chewy green beans which tastes the same after awhile, but overall I appreciated the hearty take on veggies.Despite my doubts, the FRESH POTATO CHIPS ($9) was definitely a grown-up version of chips. The potato chips were crispy and really did taste freshly baked, and it the white cheddar, bacon, scallions, and tomato relish incorporated familiar flavors of baked potatoes.The CHICKEN POT PIE ($15) was a gastropub spin on comfort food, with tender chicken thighs, an aromatic thyme gravy, and the pie component as a clever, guilty-pleasure buttery biscuit crumble on top.I think my favorite food item were the MAINE CRAB CAKES ($14)--an amazing, near molten softness delicately coated with a thin crispy coating. Although it was less crab based and almost half mashed potatoes, the texture was memorable and the flavors blended together well with the earthiness of the avocado (!!!) mousse, jalapeno remoulade, and micro basil.The CRISP GULF SHRIMP ($14) reminded me of the famous garlic prawns at the Lotus of Siam in Vegas, since the shrimp were fried to a light, crispy coating. I do think the sweet Thai chili sauce overwhelmed both the shrimp and the micro cilantro; it came dangerously close to what you'd expect to be P.F. Chang's sweet and sour shrimp. The PARISIAN GNOCCHI ($16) came paired with parma prosciutto, arugula, and shaved parmesan. The texture of the gnocchi is such that it tends to melt in your mouth, and the composition is interesting with the prosciutto lining the bottom of the plate.Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Wright & Co. which is perfect for a date, a night out with friends, and if you want to treat yourself. Note that they don't take reservations and they don't seat you until the whole party is present, so plan accordingly. It's conveniently within walking distance to Fox Theatre, and there are several parking lots in the area. My perspective may be skewed from SF/Chicago/Michelin obsessions, but in my personal opinion, I think their drinks are a notch above the food. While the food is definitely gastropub-worthy (on the right track or the Wright track?) there's room for some fine-tuning (or in the gastropub world, micro-tuning? :)"}, {"review_id": "TYt3FfRFNwFFrRSuFC9Sxw", "user_id": "zDaTJ0wc3L_8LmogvICk4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Worth the wait.

He went, literally above and beyond, and he was so funny too! Justin made the night that much more enjoyable. The food was just as good as it was when we first visited, years ago.

Tuna tar tar was different from every other tartar that I've had before. I liked it anyway. The fried shrimp was good, however, i think want as sophisticated as other items on the menu.

The customer service, the food and the ambience is what drives this rating. Once you step into this place you get a good insight into what you are getting yourself into, along with chipper customer service that helps create a welcoming environment to chow down on some tasty dishes. This isn't food that you just order and consume, this is food that you selectively pick out based on your own understanding of what will excite your taste buds and that will in the end elevate your mood. What was ordered was the following: Fresh Potato Chips, Maine Crab Cakes, Crisp Gulf Shrimp and Parisian Gnocchi. All of these dishes seem like simple foods that don't require a whole lot of thought but don't be naive about it. These dishes were exquisite by themselves and as a whole. Fresh Potato Chips: These were delicate crispy wafers that did not show any hints of an oily bath. They were bathed in a rich white cheddar sauce, topped with a proper tomato relish that helped balance out the gracefully sprinkled on bacon pieces. It's as if the bacon were snowflakes that were purposefully distributed among this mound of flavor. The tomato relish had a hint of sweetness to help balance the dish with cutting through the salt, not that it was salty but a well thought out dish.Maine Crab Cakes: 4 mini cakes of pure joy that are plump with Crab. Everything is well balanced as far as crab cake ingredients, you don't have show stealers that ruin your bites. They come with an avocado mousse and jalapeño remoulade that blanket it in creamy goodness, adding to the already flavorful cake and crowned with a micro green that gives the dish it's little fresh crisp.Crisp Gulf Shrimp: these fellas are finely battered and fried, bathing in a tasty Thai Chilli Sauce. Now don't be scared, this isn't spicy by any means, it's a full body sauce that compliments the shrimp. Just imagine the Gulf fried shrimp performing a synchronized swim routine in a pool of flavor, choreographed by a chef who understand presentation and flavor are one.Parisian Gnocchi: this dish is packed full of flavor, literally packed-jam packed. A plate filled with flavor pillows softly laying atop a bed of finely carved prosciutto, with a delicate forest of arugula reaching out, along with shavings of parm and drizzles of saba (balsamic vinegar). This dish embodies rich flavors that explode in your mouth.These dishes though they may seem small, they are rich and filling. Be brave and taste what you want but by no means waste a single bite or leave anything on your plate, it would be a tragedy to see food that has been thoughtfully prepared see its destiny come to a crashing end at the bottom of a waste bin.Now go eat and be merry.Oh yeah try \"Blake Flannel Mouth\", it pairs with the food perfectly adding hints of bright crisp tones to every bite."}, {"review_id": "acUrdFqxyb8Cl2MkySF6ag", "user_id": "d5l-f2xQKAwfwpDxXIsXxw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "I don't quite understand the allure of this place.

Their menu is advertised as small plates & shareables, but I find their portions pretty generous. My last visit here included 3 plates shared between 2 people and we had a carryout bag when done dining. Tried the Kale salad but thought the yogurt dressing was too tart and somewhat bitter, so not a fan of that one. But the Ditalani Pasta & Roast Pork Tenderloin were wonderful. The pork dish was huge and we could have just shared that - no need for the pasta. On the other hand the pasta dish was delicious too, so glad we tried it anyways. We went earlier than normal so that we wouldn't have to wait - and it worked, got right in and had our choice of tables. Our server, Kevin, was friendly, pleasant and knowledgeable. He steered us to some good cocktails after we told him what we liked, and he was right on the money. He checked in frequently and was the right combo of friendly but not pushy. So A+ for service. The atmosphere is fun, you can tell everyone is enjoying their evening and their food and drinks. It's nice to be in a fun, vibrant Detroit restaurant that is doing a good job.

The decor, ambience, and overall design of this restaurant are stunning and tastefully done. We came on a busy Saturday not, but caught this at just the right time as we barely had to wait 5 minutes before being seated at this awesome half-moon both that faced out into downtown. It's all about the food though, and W&C does an amazing job with this small plates/tapas style dining. Pro Tip: For a group of four , you can add one item onto tapas plates that have 3 items so there is enough for each person in the group. No need to double up each plate (Although I'm sure doing so would make you popular with your group).Here are the items we tried: 1) Burrata Toast -Sweet Potatoes, Brussels Sprouts, Pine Nut Brittle Maple Glaze  - HOLY COW this is one of the best things I've tasted in a long time! The Burrata is like mozzarella but better, and all of the other ingredients set this dish apart. We almost ordered another of these, but we had so much more food coming. 2) Fresh potato chips - These are really good house made chips topped with White Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Scallions, & Tomato Relish. BOMB. I wish I had these around every time I was sitting down to watch a movie or game. These are a must try. 3) Roasted Vegetable  Salad - This is a really good cold veggie salad that has Garlic Yogurt, Sun Dried Tomato Vinaigrette, Crisp Chickpeas mixed in with the roasted veggies. The brussels sprouts and crispy chickpeas are especially good. 4) Wild Mushroom Arancini - Maybe the best dish of the night. Everyone in our group absolutely LOVED these delicious cheesy, crispy, mushroomy bites. 5) Parisian Gnocchi - Delicious, creamy, crispy goodness with amazing Parma prosciutto and sauce. 6) Szechuan Sirloin Steak - Listen. The steak was delicious, but honestly for my money, I would rather get two more plates for the price of the steak. It's good, but it was not quite big enough to share. 7) Maine Crab Cakes - Simply delicious with an amazing avocado mousse that sits under each cake. 8) Banana Panna Cotta - We got this small dessert to share and it was delicious. We barely had room, but we made it happen. Overall, 8 plates was the perfect amount for a group of four, so by that logic 2 plates a person is perfect. Expect to pay about $30-$35 per person with that amount of food. Go here immediately.

I'll emphasize hidden once again, because it's on the second floor of a building off the main road--Woodward. There's no sign, either, so you get a very speakeasy feel, even if you are going up in the elevator. Stepping in, it's lush and elegant; the staff greets you and directly seats you to a table. I dined with my colleagues on a Tuesday evening, and the place was pleasantly packed. I fell in love with their wine and beer list! Plenty of imported crafted brews for any beer fans. I had the sour beer from Belgium, Duchesse de Bourgogne ($9), during my visit. Sweeter than most sour beers and kind of like a cider, but still refreshing. We ordered tons of food, to share because it's tapas-style, so I'll try to keep it short and sweet:- Roasted Cashews ($7)- Roasted Baby Beets ($11), complete with house-made ricotta & balsamic- Tuna Tartare ($14), the best one, perfectly done- Pork Belly Sliders ($9), a little dry- Butternut Squash Pasta ($10), large portion, sweet and creamy butternut squash sauce complements the mini pasta shells well, and the brussel sprouts add a nice textureFor dessert (can't skip that) we shared the banana bread pudding ($7), served in a sort of small mason jar, warm and topped with a chocolate hazelnut ganache (similar to nutella). I could barely move after all of this, so you know it's good. If this doesn't do the food justice and my descriptions don't make you feel tempted to suddenly eat an inordinate amount of small meals, then I guess I'm doing it wrong.

The procuitto gave such a nice salty bite, the egg was nice and runny, and the white cheddar bechamel was also deliciously salty and creamy.The horseradish potato croquettes were also good (my least favorite of the 3). The croquettes themselves were fried really well. They were crispy on the outside and warm and warm and comforting inside, and basically fell apart when you bit into it. The smoked salmon gave it a nice saltiness and I really liked the cinnamon taste that the apple butter gave.Now the short rib hash is another winner!
