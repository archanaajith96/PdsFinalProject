The staff were efficient, knowledgeable and very friendly. They have to be fast moving but in spite of the pace our waitress was very attentive and served us well. The ribeye steak was done as requested and delicious. The NY 8 Oz steak that I had was cooked just as I like and requested. The sweet potato fries were hot and well prepared with no trace of oil. We had the burnt cream brûlée for dessert and it was delicious but a very small portion. We had observed an ice cream cake portion at the table next to us and it was huge. The four people at the table shared it and required passing it twice around the table. The noise level was very high and you could feel the large dinner crowd enjoying themselves. No higher complement could be given."}, {"review_id": "72j-XWVUJ8JO6jSubkdtTw", "user_id": "NMifUocKFFYe9aWNN1BLOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Excellent food, great staff, and drinks.

Our server Jordan was very efficient and had a pleasant personality. Was a packed house, but we were still able to get in and out within the hour so it seems they plan and staff up enough to accomodate their anticipated Thurs nite crowd (not the norm for many restaurants) The little Colonel had a filet mignon and I had a small rack of their signature BBQ ribs.

We wanted to hit up water park, so some shopping and just relax.  My kids wanted pizza from the water park but I was craving some good food and a cold beer. I yelped places close to our hotel and We decided to go to Montana's Rob and Chop House after reading some other Yelp Reviews. Before our Appetizer they brought out apples with yogurt dipping sauce (which was just what 3 swim starved little girls need) they brought more apples after the first round was gone!My girls and I shared calamari for appetizer... I wanted fried green tomatoes because of other yelp Reviews, but you try convincing two 4 year olds and a 7 year old- Fried Green Tomatoes - it's good I promiseKids got meals in sweet cars - that they kept for some awesome stuffed animal beds. I got the Ahi Tuna with garlic mashed potatoes. Everything we had was great. We will definitely be back next time we come through!"}, {"review_id": "4YHxAZRS_YmxYrmONxlqsQ", "user_id": "5hcgfaq4P09UH4-yan1WBA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "Was really hoping to get blown away by the ribs with all the accolades. However my take on the ribs were mediocre at best. The rack was quite petite and the ribs just were average,  not bad, not good. There was nothing that stood out and nothing that made them bad. We did however have a great catfish appetizer and tried the crunchy shrimp that were fun to eat. Watch out if you order a double on the drinks because it is in fact twice the price."}, {"review_id": "iOuWHAArDnl1lD__gCno5Q", "user_id": "Qn5jfucYZK0FRc5C7ijF4A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "7/24/2017", "text": "I will start with the manager on duty did remove my meal and my wife's beer from the ticket.

That plate was HELL HOT! My lamb chops were not, but the plate was. Of the three chops, one had zero meat. It was all bone. This is the meal that the manger removed from the ticket. Thank you.
