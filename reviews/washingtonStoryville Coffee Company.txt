Why?- Here, they were able to occupy a larger space therefore they are able install seating areas with large comfy leather couches, coffee tables, bars and stools and a right cozy fireplace.- One wall is made up completely of windows and overlooks Pike Place (the road) and you get a great view of the iconic sign.- The space is beautiful, comfortable and spacious enough for larger groups and study/work sessions.We ordered coffee and mocha and they were strong but not bitter.We also ordered tea and hot chocolates and they were also both very good. They melt the chocolate on the spot and mix it with hot milk. The cinnamon bun was oh-so-good. Comparable in flavor with Cinnabon... but I prefer this because the butter and sugar melted then hardened to create an awesome sugar crust on all available surface of the pastry. Perfect if you're having unsweetened coffee or tea."}, {"review_id": "NLtpk9AW7z1pc0kD3rjfuw", "user_id": "rYH17FN_7hwLDVR2ERRLlA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Storyville Coffee Company is a typical coffee shop with a bit of a more modern vibe.  Overall, I liked Storyville.  For a coffee shop, there is a lot of seating, though the place was still packed.I had a hot chocolate, but it was a bit lukewarm.  And we tried a pastry (cinnamon roll), which I thought was good."}, {"review_id": "ZDf6CyfgOycAuCqoellGPw", "user_id": "_KDforIDsQS6bIaJi0_V0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "But first, coffee.

More like hypevilleExpensive coffee for pretty normal tasting coffee. Price just did not justify it. A plus: I got a free bag of coffee for signing up for their newsletter.Place has decent ambience, but is super crowded, but that should be expected since you're at Pike Place, so that's completely fine.Coffee felt quite mild. Wish it was more chocolatey and coffee-y. For the stuff you charge, you'd expect something a little better than a glass of milk with mild coffee powder.Regardless, I might try this place again, perhaps it was a 1 off mild coffee cup."}, {"review_id": "mlrYOVumf-_VEM7775vS7Q", "user_id": "oEvu2-E0q6OXB8_WxKf1-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I came here because a friend had recommended it to me. Initially, I did not expect to enjoy it so much, because it seemed like just another coffee shop, nothing I couldn't experience here in California. But as I ordered my drink and sat down, I soon fell in love with this place. The ambiance is everything. With dim light and natural light shining in, and the soft tunes playing in the background, it was the perfect spot to just relax and unwind. The baristas were super nice. They helped us with our order, answered all out questions and even let me film their latte art making. These baristas are legit perfectionists, if the art is not right, they dump the drink right in front of you and start over. During my 4 day stay in Seattle, I went to Storyville 3 times. I just couldn't get enough of this place. The drinks were good, but it was more of the ambiance and vibe of the place. This is literally the perfect Instagram coffee shop, I kid you not. I tried the Cortado, Latte and Mocha. The Cortado is served in a smaller cup, not mug, but is supposed to deliver a potent amount of caffeine. The latte was ok, pretty basic. The Mocha was my favorite. It had strong chocolate flavors, which I loved, but not too sweet."}, {"review_id": "rzWVm_yIRNJnZbokeOjrUg", "user_id": "YAaSzw0fpAYBZBNF94iNug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Wow wow wow! I would post a picture of the food I got, but it looked so good, I dug in so quick that I completely forgot to take one! It looked delicious, tasted delicious, can't go wrong with this menu. It was quite hard to find; it's on the top floor in between pike and pine street on first ave (you have to go inside first). But once I found it, it was completely worth being lost for a bit; it truly is a hidden gem, and it's a MUST go! The environment is nice, it's a little busy and loud; I wouldn't recommend for studying or working unless you're good with distractions. But wow when I sat into their brown leather couch, I felt like I melted! It was so comfortable. The ambiance with the setting and aesthetic was a nice break.The service was fantastic, the people were friendly.

It blew me away. If you are in Seattle, do NOT miss this stop - it is a coffee lovers dream. Pro tip: it is a little hidden in Pike Place Market, but you have to go upstairs when you see the sign for \"Can Can\".I have a dairy allergy and thus always need milk alternatives but am hesitant to try out new places cause I find the almond milk can be hit or miss BUT Storyville's almond milk latte was the best I have EVER had! It is so creamy, and the perfect amount of natural sweetener so it doesn't over power the coffee but takes away the end bitterness. I could NOT get enough. If anyone out there has allergies like I do, don't miss this spot! My partner tried their breakfast sandwich and he was RAVING over it - even said that it was the best breakfast sandwich he had ever had. Due to my allergy I couldn't try, but he loves his food so I will take his word for it. OH! And the tomato soup is vegan friendly - still creamy and delicious.

We stopped here in the morning to grab our coffee fix and it sure hit the spot! It's a little tricky finding a seat since it's so packed, but definitely worth it. Anyways, the interior decor is adorable and great for taking photos (for all the tourists out there like me!).I ordered an earl grey tea latte, since I'm trying to lay off coffee, and I really enjoyed it! Although it takes a couple of extra minutes to brew the tea, it's worth waiting the extra time for. The flavor of the earl grey tea is strong and delicious. Totally warms you up in the morning and prepares you for the rest of the day. It's a good alternative if you are avoiding coffee, but still want something milky/creamy. Side note: the cups are super cute too - it looks like silhouettes of Peter Pan!This coffee shop is definitely worth stopping by while you're in Seattle if you're a fan of great coffee (or tea) and delicious-looking pastries!"}, {"review_id": "mpQRq9sw_yxl5vbS08jbqg", "user_id": "XlrhaNv4cvc4y5_X7QZgBg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "After spending a few hours trying to take in as much of Pike Place Market as I possibly could, I found myself in desperate need of a cup of hot cocoa to warm me up bfore heading back to the airport.

Kristian, Storyville's owner, reached out to me regarding my first experience and was incredibly receptive to the feedback I provided. This level of thought clearly extends to every other facet of Storyville from the coffee to the pastries.We ordered a cappuccino with Coconut Cashew Mylk, Machiatto, a cinnamon roll, and a chocolate croissant. The pastries were, again, perfect compliments to the coffee. Even if you are not a self-proclaimed coffee snob, you will clearly taste the difference between Storyville and other roasters. The biggest game changer is the alternative mylks that Storyville offers. The coconut cashew is creamy with a nuttiness that doesn't overpower the coffee and that both alternative and cow's milk drinkers will enjoy.Storyville remains both one of my favorite shops to treat myself to a delicious coffee and spot to impress any visitors with world-famous Seattle coffee."}, {"review_id": "f3tPx9zKzijkAJ5ArYyBUQ", "user_id": "AChi-qcfH1u3KYGVox9hZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Whoa... did I just walk into a club, or is this Storyville? Minus the deep vibrating bass and loud bumping music, walking through those doors brought me back to my clubbing daze. There was a nice chill vibe with several pockets of people either sipping on their drinks staring at their laptops or those chilling by the fireplace. I chose to get the chai latte cuz it was towards the end of the day. 2 minutes went by and I was handed my drink. It was luke warm (wished it was slightly warmer), but the flavor was spot on. Just enough chai without it being overpowering or watered down. It was so good, I forgot about the milk they put in! Being lactose sensitive, I started to freak out half way through, but luckily, my stomach held on well. Maybe it was luck, maybe my body finally accepted it, or maybe it was soy... Probably not. Worth it? For ~$5 a drink, I felt it was slightly expensive for a 6-8oz drink. However, it's a nice place to take a break from the city feels and immerse yourself unique environment."}, {"review_id": "nxqdqCEjHfNJS3sLyO07ug", "user_id": "JUMoQGlREHd4RpT-5Vfg4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Wish I had tried this place sooner as I went to Pike Place Market nearly every day during our visit.
