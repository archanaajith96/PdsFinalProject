We LOVED it.I got the chorizo sausage bowl and my wife got the avocado toast with bacon. Both were fantastic (Food 5/5). The place is small but homey, and one of the owners informed us that a lot of the decorations on the wall were given to them by their regulars. From old school albums (Tribe Called Quest, Jay-Z) to old school comics (X-Men, Avengers), it's definitely an eclectic mix of decorations. I loved the creativity. Sidenote: it's not the fanciest place so don't expect it to be (Atmosphere 5/5). Service was also great (Service 5/5) with no complaints. It was a great and simple breakfast. (Overall 5/5)."}, {"review_id": "MvKQ9qPhcjrTGcM0RJfamg", "user_id": "6yKF5Jg7EXDWWmYk3AkChg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Allentown is a unique mix of classic and modern times. There are a lot of tastier places in and around the city. Boutique stores and family eateries are found prominently. This creative approach makes Edie's a food place for college graduates and bag packers/ tourists. They use locally sourced , seasonal produce. Good place for breakfast/ brunch as the sun rays fall directly through the glass window on the front. It's a tiny eatery with no fancy but casual look. Menu highlights include croque madame(fried egg,honey ham,cheeses Bechtel sauce on brioche) ; crispy chicken cowabunga( buttermilk fried chicken , pickles, bacon) . Omg I must add that the bacon was so delicious n made perfect. Infact it had a perfect salty taste . Drink options are not much but tea n coffee are freshly brewed . Since I am a tea fan so asked for English breakfast tea n it was amazing. Perfectly steeped in a big cup for small price. ( more quality food within my budget makes me extra generous to give stars) They need high power exhaust fan as the concept of kitchen is open. Also if they can speed up the preparation ( maybe we were the first walk in client) The guys  are very friendly though n they do delivery m pick up."}, {"review_id": "STsVDQKgWfgN9iwv6aRbiA", "user_id": "twql508qxbaNTBzSpJMmcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Found this spot on yelp and took a chance being im  VERY meticulous with my food. Walked in and was greeted with a warm smile. Felt so homey. Ordered the BAE sandwich for Babe lol and the chicken and waffles. Omg for the first time eating in the LVBA area you could see the seasoning in the eggs. The chicken and waffles were so on point. Now this isn't just you ordinary waffle. It was like a flan flavor meets the Edie's Waffle. Highly recommended if your looking for a change in the bland foods diners serve now a days. Seating is limited but did notice you can call ahead to reserve seating. Great job to the Edie's staff. We'll def visit again"}, {"review_id": "jD4aY50QSKsFeOCwyyO1qA", "user_id": "ctOwPrOBIv5X5uwVhNOXIQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Usually I am not in Allentown for lunch so we stopped by Edie's because we heard it was good. I got a chicken wrap with pomme frites and my fiancé got some wings. Everything was very fresh and a great lunch spot. Only downside is there is not much room to sit and eat inside. There is one big table for anyone to sit and two high tops. Since we had a baby we had to share the table with some folks, which was fine but probably a better place to get takeout."}, {"review_id": "eKdW7-Svwvkxh5h8bUyZgg", "user_id": "KZ8TPIwUeenIIV77OBLCVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Yes I thought you used fresh potatoes in the chorizo bowl not dried up old french fries so if you're going to change the recipe at least inform the customer they seem to be re-fried grease soaked and dried out and some of them are even crispy this is not the quality I'm used to very disappointed this time.

There's plenty of street parking in a short radius, and we sat ourselves outside in the sun. This choice may have been part of the reason that our service was slow. I ordered a chicken wrap, asking for it to be grilled instead of fried. The sauce with the chicken was tangy and sweet. This was my favorite part of the meal. The pita was chewy and the fries were sandy. The $2 surcharge for lunch items must be to offset the energy bill for the sunlight. I hope that the portions are bigger in some way."}, {"review_id": "W_OsVeD0cYePqpjDZ1IOkQ", "user_id": "bniif7m36wCoOEEzbDVJzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/1/2017", "text": "It was a nice day so family decided to take a ride where to go is the question. We looked for a spot in DE or PA cause didn't want to stay in the state. We stumble upon Edie's on Yelp & Google all gave great reviews. Okay then let's head to Allentown not like it's our first time in the city. The drive was around 80 minutes no problem cause the 5 stars say it's worth the drive. When we got there walked in will I say it's cozy no to small for that intimate it is. By the front window are two tables that can sit 6 -8 people. 1 table behind there that sits 2 one along the side wall maybe 3. I am guessing it's a take out place on those busy days. Now once we are seated our server hands us the menu prices are easy on your pocket. You will not break your budget if you sit an eat. Drinks ordered café of course and two Honest teas. To much cream in the café so traded with my daughter for her tea. Orders were placed Chicken & Waffle, Teriyaki Beef & Rice Bowl and Pancakes and Bacon with fruit. As we wait for our food the good music is playing in the background. The staff of all guys are super friendly made you feel as if you are being entertained at the house. Once our food came out there was hush over the table as we prayed. We had to give thanks and apologize to the food cause it was going to be slaughtered. When I say the chicken breast was fried to perfection I kid you not. My wife cut into the breast it was juicy cause we know if chicken breast is over cooked it's dry. The waffle fills the plate I damn near had order envy. I would've if my dish didn't look as beautiful as it did. The beef glistering the broccoli super green the carrots looking tasty. My daughter had 3 pancakes some fresh strawberries and grapes with some crispy bacon. The teriyaki beef was so tender it can be chewed with no teeth the broccoli had the bite just the way you like it. Brown rice what can you say but love it my wife tasted my plate and said I'm ordering that to go. The food is truly worth the 5 stars it has. We all were extremely happy with our meals daughter was only one to have some left to take home. We were finished our meals and ordered something to go. Teriyaki beef & rice bowl & king wings to go. When all said and done the check was $62. How can one cry about that they can't. We paid the check and added a email cause they have a points plan and we will receive $5 off our next meal cool. I told one of the staff that we drove 80 minutes to get there. He was truly thankful that we made the trip and wished us a safe trip home. Side not: there were two young ladies with their children sitting next to us. The staff brought two Ninja Turtles to the table so the children could entertain themselves I thought that was so cool"}, {"review_id": "nxiFoQPoLRQ9DtmVahPp1w", "user_id": "-BODPGpo8ViI8LqcNOdoLw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "For breakfast ordered the chorizo bowl.

Latte was weak (they made it stove top). The wrap I ordered with fried chicken and honey mustard was not good. The fried chicken pieces seemed more like scraps and the pieces were dry...my bf ordered the steak and eggs and he loved it. Interesting place to try once...we probably won't be back.

Luckily we were 'early birds' (Sat at 11ish) and grabbed a seat. The seating is VERY limited here but we were a party of 2. The menu is small, while still featuring a variety of items. I was CRAVING a croissant like no other that morning, so I saw the BAE (bacon, egg, and cheese, on a croissant) and didn't have to look at another item. Unfortunately, I found out upon ordering, they had no more croissants, and that it would instead be served on Texas Toast. This was disappointing only because I REALLY wanted a croissant. But the Texas Toast was amazing and the potatoes on the side were SO GOOD. They offer a 'brunch' option which is slightly more and offers pastries at the end, but we opted out since I didn't think I could eat all that. Though the table next to us did get the pastries and they looked amazing (cooked in house). By the time we were paying, the place had a long wait of to-go orders and a big table had just come in, so it seems like a popular local spot. It's a little hidden on a side street, but definately worth having a bite. I'll remember it next time I'm staying in downtown Allentown!"}, {"review_id": "MtnQgv0DTSeIyMZVYRSTcA", "user_id": "oCh-tTb-zSPWgfU3BuARJw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "I wanted to like this place so bad.
