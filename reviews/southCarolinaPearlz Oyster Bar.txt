So we scarfed down 1 doz raw, a few of them baked ones, some fish taco, and beers.  Oysters were decent medium sized, and properly shucked. That means, no shell chips, detached, and liquor intact.  The definitely did the oysters right. We sat at the window, and that allowed us to people watch while slurping down the oysters.. or maybe they were watching us.  Who knows...   I have oysters and cold beer.. I win..Pro tip.. Come early, you can find parking on the side of the street, just pop in a credit card.. $2/hour."}, {"review_id": "-oDou-6sdMGqMprBjjKm5A", "user_id": "3yivaHgZGp9-2IG00MRDbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Came just after 3 when switch from lunch toHappy hour.  Got the peel and eat shrimp, oysters, Mahi taco and seafood gumbo.

Upon entering, we were informed by the hostess that there would be a 30 minute wait, which we didn't mind as it gave us time to walk down and view the ocean from a nearby pier. Upon returning, I can't lie... I was a little disappointed that they stuck a party of 8 at a regular sized booth, where we were all a little uncomfortable from literally sitting on top of each other. Eventually, I asked for another chair so that I could be seated at the head of the table, to which my waiter responded: Yeah, you can go and get one from up front. Ooooookay. That was different. But, whatever right? I'm not a complainer, and I was not about to let their lack of quality service deter me. Once we were able to order, Melissa, a co-worker of mine from the South Carolina area recommended the fish and chips. I ordered that, and I liked it a lot. It took our food a little while to make its way to the table, and it was understandable, as it was very busy, but when it arrived, I was pleased. I also enjoyed their calamari.All in all, it wasn't the greatest experience, but it wasn't the worst. My recommendation would be to go during the middle of the week when they're not so overwhelmed."}, {"review_id": "5lcQBjh29b1hfRtev8HDYw", "user_id": "L6t052lKtrQnMJb0eQKbOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Shared three dozen oysters and a fried chicken sandwich.

The food was really good-especially the Ahi Tuna burger. It was lightly seared to perfection and very flavorful while the tuna steak was tender for the bigger size it was! I don't eat raw oysters, but my boyfriend devoured them- I'm going to say they were just fine! We also tried the baked avocado with egg and shrimp, that's where I took a star away as the shrimp was overcooked. It was tougher and lost its flavor. Also, I had their sangria and it just tasted like a white wine spritzer. Other than that, the idea of the small plate was creative and the drink was still refreshing."}, {"review_id": "zEodG3tM3xa0fq_qdCGU9w", "user_id": "wABHp4fGUC-0acRKhmQO2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Fresh oysters, fantastic service.

Although I didn't have any oysters they looked great and let's be honest it's hard to mess up an oysterOrdered the peel and eat shrimp which came with 7 shrimp I believe. It came with cocktail  sauce and extra horseradish if you wanted to kick things up a notch. The shrimp was also powdered with oldbay seasoning which I have never had before on shrimp but was actually amazing. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and peeled with easeThe interior of the restaurant is modern clean and attractiveCons-Yes, the cheap PBR's and Miller's are obviously priced with the intention that you will order more food / fish (which we did ) but my fiancé and I just wanted to start with a beer before ordering and I felt like the server was irritated that we didn't order food right away and it made things really uncomfortable.  Service is a deal breaker for me. Even if we didn't end up ordering more I'm. It really cool with servers doing that.  After the shrimp we ordered the fish and chips.  I felt the portions of the sides were undersized. If you are going to plate with coleslaw it should be more then a tablespoons worth....if nothing else for playing purposes.  The chips are actual chips not fries (which are not available). The chips were not great and tasted over cooked. The fish itself was good once you managed to break away the out crust of over done mantle thickness batter.  Again, just want a few cheap drinks to throw back with a few oysters? Go for itActually want a good mixture of food/ service check out other options"}, {"review_id": "qLC9VIa65LRRJvRDC9_9GQ", "user_id": "rA_Qx4Eu7ZBFdN2Abc3DUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "I visited for happy hour and got a glass of champagne, 8 oysters, and my friend got a beer.

Was deciding between Pearlz and 167 Raw, but chose Pearlz because of their happy hour (M-F, 5-7pm). Unfortunately, we were so stuffed from our last meal that we didn't get over to Pearlz until about 6:20pm, and we were told it was going to be a 45-60 min wait. They took my number down and we walked two blocks east to the waterfront park to check out the Pineapple Fountain, and walk along the Battery. They sent me a text around 6:30pm letting me know they'd text me when my table was ready, and at 7:05, I got a text to reply \"OTW\" within 5 mins and to start heading back. Our group of 7 was seated in the back near the bar and the bathroom. We started off with a round of oyster shooters (not me though, since I'm not a fan of oysters and also don't drink). Instead I got myself a cup of clam chowder. The girls waited for my clamchowder to come, which did take a little while, since we wanted to do a cheers. By the time it came out, their shooters were a little warm so wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been. Letting the oysters sit and soak up the Bloody Mary-type drink also make the oyster super strong, and one of the girls in our group found the oyster pretty gross and couldn't finish the whole thing.Really enjoyed my clam chowder. It came in a soup mug and had a great consistency - wasn't too thick or thin, so I was able to hold it by the handing and drink it like tea almost. Had wonderful flavor without being too salty, a problem I find in a lot of clam chowders.We also ordered the corn fritters, peel-and-eat jumbo shrimp, crab dip, oysters (of course), crabcake burgers, and lobster rolls. I've definitely had better corn fritters - it tasted more like a zeppole with a few pieces of corn inside and not as creamy as other corn fritters I've had. Not a bad bite since it was nice and toasty and made you feel warm inside but shouldn't be called  a corn fritter. Should give up on the corn, add a little more powdered sugar, and just call it a zeppole.The shrimp was ok. Pretty big and fresh, but didn't have as much taste as I would've liked. The outside looked like it had old bay seasoning sprinkled on, but of course you don't taste any of it after you peel the shrimp.The crab dip was amazing, our group loved it and ate way too much bread because of it. Everyone seemed to enjoy the oysters but didn't hear anyone raving about how amazing it was.The crabcake burger was gigantic and the girls who ordered it seemed to enjoy it, but neither were able to come close to finishing it.The lobster roll was disappointing. The bread was absolutely drenched in butter and so greasy I felt gross the rest of the night. The lobster itself was just ok, wasn't particularly juicy or sweet. The roll came with what looked like house-made BBQ potato chips, which was pretty good.Not bad overall for our first dinner in Charleston."}, {"review_id": "Sayp3oCXU-XN0BgqrHcVqw", "user_id": "8tpHcVFr72k99arLW40_Mg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "We had a great time here!
