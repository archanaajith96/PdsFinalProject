I've passed by here many times but I'm not the crazy hamburger fan. I don't want a peanut butter or other mad combo. Just a burger. No cheese even. In fact if truth be told I really wanted to try their banana pudding milkshake. I will be back just for this perfect shake. Real ice cream, hot fudge, bananas and vanilla wafers. It is amazingly thick and flavorful. To make it perfect, it comes with a sharpened, very wide straw so that you can easily slurp in all the chunky banana chunks. There's even a long spoon that is slightly canted so it's easy to get all the juice from the bottom of the glass. I ordered a Plain Jane burger but with 1000 island dressing instead of catsup. The burger was perfect - crispy on the outside but pink and juicy on the inside. The bun was, you guessed it, perfectly toasted but soft. One of the best burgers I've eaten in ages! I can't believe how great this meal was. I never write such superlative reviews, but Crave deserves it. They should call this place Perfect, but when I get home I'm sure I'll see why it's called Crave."}, {"review_id": "1mzKRjpJ-wC9qgzMnKSfhQ", "user_id": "iK8q7IFQTWEL30aD-EJXYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/16/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This restaurant was a fun experience! The first impression is this modern, spacious burger spot with a strong aroma, but once you get in, there's so much more. The food portions are enormous and there are so many burgers among others to choose from. I ordered the Sin City burger and the tempura cheese was fascinating. The wait staff is not the most friendly bunch, but they're kind and there if you need them. They offer a 10% military discount and this spot is definitely a must-try. Blessings! Update 16 Jan 18: Our group had a fun time once again. Food was on par with last time and we were overwhelmed with the gigantic portions. We definitely overate! This time I had the fatty melt, which was two grilled cheese sandwiches with a burger, bacon, and veggie decorations. Another good choice! One negative was that our group didn't get the military discount. We didn't ask but two of us were also in uniform. This is probably on us so we'll ask next time. We appreciate having this restaurant so close to the Academy! Blessings!"}, {"review_id": "r8fh6uTgyt3_NUK5qwAdhA", "user_id": "w7qY-x9PN-CTQRw0u45c7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Don't come here for a low cal meal-you gotta come here to splurge. Crave has some outrageous burgers that are well executed in a greasy delicious masterpiece. I've tried the popper, love stinks, fatty melt, and a special with mac n cheese and flaming hot Cheetos. YUP. The portions are huge for the price also. I keep wanting to try one of their shakes but I am inevitably stuffed after the burger. Maybe next time (maybe)."}, {"review_id": "gKNWfA4yQKDAzCISbLM-1g", "user_id": "l1oVjrUuUQl75_pm2wZJ2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Alcohol & ice cream?!? Who would have thunk it!

This time I decided on the Sin City burger. Came with candied bacon, avocado, grilled onions and a serious, I mean it, serious piece of tempura fried cheese. It's a mountain of a burger and the flavors really tie well together. About half of the cheese won't stay on the burger, just let it go and eat with your fries afterwards. I also grabbed the fried pickles, large plate and it was really large and delicious. Share it with like 4 or more adults, not 2 like I tried. The shakes are also amazing and this time of year they are featuring Girl Scout cookie flavored shakes!!! Stop in for a great meal."}, {"review_id": "js-5vt2To1hrJLwVSkTpEw", "user_id": "FjqtSuGb6ueHG95mEgDL4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "Two words: POPPER BURGERWe visited this joint after a hike, we didn't know much about it aside from that their burgers had unique toppings. The burger of my dreams, the popper, had a cream cheese, jalapeño, avocado goodness topped on. They are generous on the toppings too, great flavors and value. Truffle fries were also divine. You order as pink or no pink, no specifics beyond that, which makes it easy enough and efficient. Great service and prices, if you are on the fence, try it! My buddy was also a huge fan of their milkshakes."}, {"review_id": "fidtgeKcx35NHEcIl7ig9g", "user_id": "0RX9w878R80Ok5iPrNBv3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "If my brunch is my main girl than burgers are my side chick. However, not just any burger will do, I expect a certain level of quality in my burgers. Knowing that my bitch must be both \"bad\" and \"boujee\" my roommate suggested we go to Crave Burger in Denver. Crave Burger specializes in unique burger creations and milkshakes both of which are near and dear to my heart. I decided to go with the \"Sin City\" burger because I too like to live dangerously; crispy tempura-fried sharp cheddar, bourbon-glazed onions, candied bacon, avocado, lettuce & ketchup 12 and just a hint of love. I like to take my burgers sans onions due to the fact that onions are a garbage vegetable nevertheless this burger was stacked.I had no idea that the sexiest thing I'd hear that day would be \"crispy tempura-fried sharp cheddar\". This burger is all about the bite meaning every bite consists of each topping. I honestly don't think I stopped eating long enough to breathe once I started. I was also legitimately sad when I finished like a true fat kid. Missing my beautiful burger already I decided to fill that void with a milkshake. (Dessert goes to your heart, not your stomach) The S'more shake caught my eye; Vanilla ice cream, cinnamon sugar, roasted marshmallow, chocolate chips, graham crackers, hot fudge, Hershey's Chocolate Syrup.If I wasn't worried about my inner fat kid becoming an outer fat I could've easily put down two of these shakes. Just like the burger was all about the bite, this shake was all about the sip. Also the toasted marshmallow on top errrrr merrrrr gawdddddddddd *heavy breathing* simply amazeballs. Crave Burger is a chain restaurant so I highly recommend seeing if there is one located by you."}, {"review_id": "cHBn3m-sEqLXr1TKi-boKA", "user_id": "4T5CmrbBpWelGaY6RvT7jA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I don't know how they do it, but the Love Stinks burger is INCREDIBLE!

The only issue is that my wife requested her burger well done.  When her burger arrived it was on the rare side of medium-rare (very pink and bloody).  She returned her burger. The staff sent us an extra order of fries to make up for the mistake.  When her new burger returned it was still not well done (pink in the center) but she ate around the edges. She liked the taste but would have preferred her burger done to her request.  All-in-all, a very good place to grab an awesome burger but the customers taste need to be accommodated.  We will go back at some point and give them another shot.

I think perhaps the one night we came in where I said it was only three star might've been an off night or the burger I ate wasn't as good as most of the others. Both their Sin City burger and their Love Stinks burgers are out of this world good, and the Buffalo Bill burger was equally tasty. The food was served exactly to our expectations. Served hot and juicy with some pink. The Love Stinks burger has cream cheese with garlic, but the garlic is in no way overpowering. Delectable! We prefer the sweet potato fries which have a good crunch and are not soggy which we have had at other places. Their fried pickles are divine and the large plate is ginormous! If you have never had fried pickles before, try them here!  The burgers are what I would call \"trendy\" and not what you can find at a typical burger place which is what makes this place stand out. At this point, we have tried quite a variety and except for the one night where we thought it was just OK, the other times we've been here have all been a delight for our burger taste buds."}, {"review_id": "nkMzeOarrxCbK77B-R6PVw", "user_id": "nYYCKU90DPEgwrVVl4XFyQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I want to like Crave more than I do, since the burgers are quality beef and unique.

Therefore, it can get packed, but there is usually parking open someplace close.Service: The service was pretty good. I asked the waitress about a couple of things, and she gave me great feedback. Also, I got a cheese sauce with my fries, which was not compatible and not at all what I wanted. She was kind enough to take it off my order since I didn't eat any of it, cause it wasn't at all what I wanted. (I think she kind of knew it wouldn't mix well together cause she gave me a small amount in a separate container...)Food: The food was pretty good, but greasy. I loved their truffle fries though, omg amazing! Plus their alcoholic milkshake, I requested Kahlua with mine since I don't like Baileys. I would suggest also getting a better rum/vodka with the drink since it usually comes w/ a wells rum/vodka, which can make the taste undesirable (I tried my coworker's and it was blah). The Sin City burger was delicious but really big and kind of greasy. It was kind of falling apart so it was harder to eat. I ordered a simple burger, but my coworker got the burger w/ the PB (Nutty Professor) and said it was delish!~ Maybe if I come back, then next time I'll give it a Go... Ambience: It was a cute, small place with TVs if you wanted to watch sports. I believe the NFL draft was on when we were there. Also, plenty of tables/booths. We had a group of 12+ so we had to sit next to each other in the long booths cause they didn't have a place to put us, but that was fine with us. Don't know if it's usually able to hold big groups because of the way that the booths are set up...They did have a nice bathroom also, just FYI."}, {"review_id": "VyasU3yYKPOEkDygSa3Onw", "user_id": "W3_BtGC_RFPbE6_L4rAkJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Best burgers in the tri-state area and great service."}, {"review_id": "-M-PRDMuBpc0g-RpzemYBA", "user_id": "cdUyX8B26FmyB-grAEM66A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "Man this place was sooooooo goooooood!
