After stopping at Sushi Yoshi, which was closed, we headed to Inakaya. We had a variety of things, which were fine. The service was good, but very slow. I ordered the Firecracker roll, and was shocked to receive a roll about the size and shape of a large avocado! And it had been DEEP FRIED in bread crumbs. Looked a bit like a Scotch egg. There was some seafood buried inside this breaded monstrosity, but I couldn't taste it. It was truly terrible.The Flower roll was ok. We had a couple of other things that were OK. I look forward to trying Sushi Yoshi soon. Im not in a rush to return to Inakaya."}, {"review_id": "64PagForvXgx-i8vwBNdxg", "user_id": "tALcCpJ6upfa4mqq3fS6ew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Simple, Traditional & Delicious! The rice is perfection and the presentation is clean. The tempura was so hot and fresh, perfectly seasoned and the Server was also prompt and patient bringing us our food and Sapporo quickly. We custom made a roll, Hamachi Shiso Maki. Yellowtail rolled with the Japanese Shiso leaf makes a beautiful pairing. We also enjoyed the Honeymoon nigiri, which is Scallops with spicy mayo and placed in top of rice with a nori band. We had a spicy tuna roll as well as 2 Escolar nigiri... We live in Charlotte but often visit family in Columbia and we make sure to stop at Inakaya each time we're in the area."}, {"review_id": "ZlluP0JzdYd_ycS34uXzrQ", "user_id": "mMhSGKkSFKbgqZ4xJccqyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "One of my favorite places to go eat when back home visiting the parents. I highly recommend this place. Authentic. I've tried their udon, special rolls they have such a variety and they all taste good. We have been coming here since they first opened up. The sushi chefs are awesome as always. Try the sashimi platters if your sharing with family or friends get the sashimi for two. Very fresh fish and delicious! The appetizers are great also. We usually get the octopus and seaweed salad super good. Try the broiled mackerel too. Overall service is quick. Filling up the drinks they do in a timely manner. Love this place and will go back anytime. One thing on the weekends prepare to wait though. During the week is best to go :)"}, {"review_id": "eBotvGhqcZyuxMscZn6DuQ", "user_id": "i0FplWd6S-41Fr4Hm0FHIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "My little family of 5 went out for a dinner last week and YAY....

I don't remember much about that first visit. Had dinner there tonight with a friend and we decided to share so we could try several things on the menu. We enjoyed the tempura appetizer. It was very crispy and not at all greasy. The sushi was fantastic! I had the Vegas roll and the fried oyster roll. Both were delicious! We also tried the red bean ice cream and the green tea ice cream. The green tea ice cream was just OK but the red bean ice cream had an interesting flavor and texture. I guess were feeling adventurous because we also tried the black sesame mochi ice cream. I'm not sure I would have that again but it was interesting!We also had the peach sake. It was very good. All in all, the service was OK. No big complaints. I think I will return here again."}, {"review_id": "tR6gPOnMzP_gLK3Q_iw__g", "user_id": "qkZS0QPxhMCqxJmtPB3n6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2017", "text": "Do you like good sushi? Do you like saving money? Then this is the restaurant for you! I've been living in Columbia for nearly 4 years now and this is my favorite go to place when I get a sushi craving. The sushi chefs are Japanese and really get to know their customers. If you become a regular, they'll greet you when you come in and sit at the sushi bar.I always come here on Monday's where they have REALLY good specials on a good portion of their regular and special rolls. They are split up into 3 categories with rolls being $3, $5, or $7. Everyday they also have a Happy hour special on domestics for $2. Moreover, there's also a Teriyaki Beef or Chicken, Tempura, and California Triple Combo with soup and salad that you can get for only $12 that's available till 6:30. One big caveat is that they are very strict about the times! If it's 6:31 that's too late for the special and they won't give it to you.If this is your first time in Inakaya, they are located next to Tsubaki, which is a karaoke bar that serves food as well. The restaurant is a lot bigger than it looks. They have a large sushi bar area and 2 medium sized seating sections with options of tables or booths. Near the bathroom, they also have a traditional Japanese dining area that you can sit in if you have a large group. It's authentic with the decorations and you have to take your shoes off and sit on the floor. The Food: We ordered a lot of different rolls including the Philly Roll, Godzilla, Pink Dragon, Pink Lady Roll, and others. My personal favorite roll of all time that they have is the FIESTA ROLL. That is hands down the best roll that they have! All our food came out tasting fresh and tasted delicious as always. The sushi rice that they use is really high quality and not that sticky cheap stuff. The $12 Teriyaki Beef or Chicken, Tempura, and California Triple Combo with soup and salad that I got is a really good deal and definitely worth a try.The only areas of improvement is that sometimes they get really busy on the weekends and on days that have good specials like Mondays and it gets hard to flag down the server to put in orders or refill drinks. Overall, I highly recommend that you give a place a try! Also worth sitting down in the authentic Japanese section for a different and unique dining experience."}, {"review_id": "NL-5u3mepQ-OIvj4wzfO2Q", "user_id": "b7dSpL9HXpUHAUN1KM55Pw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "This place is just like any typical Japanese restaurant down in the south. Extremely overpriced! The food is good, that I cannot deny but the wait times can be long. Personally I think this place is over hyped. It's rice and raw fish people, when they start serving the sushi on peices steak strips instead of a dumb boat then they can charge 25$"}, {"review_id": "XkEj6rmlW4rzVbhfzzBXOw", "user_id": "yPI9H8_CmXnz99Hh-1PvBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "I love this place!!

When we arrived, the Host is not there. We waited for a few minutes for her. When she arrived, she gets my name and told us to be seated in waiting area for a while. We've waited for like 10 minutes to have a table though there are actually 4 clean vacant tables! When we are already in our table, the server came and asked for drinks. I told her that I want a water with lemon, but she returned with just a water LOL. Moving forward for our sushi orders, that server did not give us Wasabi and ginger that is always served with the sushi.For the foods, Fiesta Roll is a must try!!! We love it! The Red Dragon is alright.The Teriyaki Chicken is so yummy. The Broiled Squid is dull. I'm giving 4 star because the foods were amazing, but the service is poor! Or maybe only that particular server that we had last night. We will be back again next week and will try the different specials."}, {"review_id": "13Ho3CjwaDD_xTuwCiDslQ", "user_id": "ATvIsf08zg9ABSntqB7C2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "I live in Southern California and I have had great sushi, but everytime I come to Columbia to visit family we have to get sushi here!

I am a frequent consumer of sushi and ordered at least 6 rolls and several pieces of sushi for a business dinner. The firecracker was so bad I literally pulled out a piece of reddish brownish fish and asked the waitress what this was. She said tuna. Interesting. I've never seen tuna with that color. My boss said that roll was terrible and we didn't even touch it. It's funny how a waitress can clearly see only one piece was eaten and didn't even bother to ask for a replacement or reimbursement. We spent over $100 for 3 people and we will NOT being going back.

Service was very good and prompt.  The food was also good.  The house salad ($2) was very fresh with crisp lettuce and probably the best ginger dressing I've had.  Some restaurants have very little dressing on their salads, which wasn't the case here.The decor is very nice and based on the number of diners this must be a very popular spot.  The only downside to the meal was that the hostess came up to our table while we were eating and asked if she could move one of our empty chairs to another table.  No big deal, but then she returned 5 minutes later and asked for the other empty chair.  All in all, I enjoyed it. My wife thought that Miyo's atmosphere and menu were better than Inakaya's.  I'm giving it three stars based on the overall experience."}, {"review_id": "WczaFeYaYiArZHDbyvTYDA", "user_id": "3UyiY4KyBvjcwWKq7_ZmrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/21/2017", "text": "The best sushi in Columbia.
