I like the decor and views of the courtyard, but the food itself was kind of disappointing. I got the chicken roti and it was not very flavorful. Also tried the pate and it honestly tasted like store-bought Oscar Meyer. Actually, Oscar Meyer might be better. How I wanted so badly to like Bouchon! We went the first time about a year ago and it also was not very memorable. Wanted to be fair and give it another shot but alas...The food is definitely not reflective of the price in my opinion.

Service: excellent, unpretentious, helpful but not overbearing. Atmosphere: indoor seating area has high vaulted dealings. French bistro seating with beautiful tiling. Outdoor seating area overlooks fountains and the pool area with lush foliage. No umbrellas so shade is not always an option Cuisine:  ordered pastry assortment: chocolate croissants, plain croissants, lemon pastry, blueberry muffins and pecan roll. All lovely and as expected for bouchon, I just wish I could have enjoyed them warm. Main dishes: we ordered the croque madame, smoked salmon eggs Benedict with avocado, quiche Florentine, and the Poulet et des Gaufres (Chicken & waffles).  All were excellent, perfectly seasons and not overly rich. The Chicken and waffles was exceptional. The chicken was roasted and perfectly moist, the chive-bacon waffle was very light, and the gravy gave the dish a savory twist.I also ordered the hibiscus champagne. The rest of the table ended up doing the same. The edible candied flower floating in mesmerizing.... and delicious. It reminds me of fruit roll ups :)"}, {"review_id": "O_qzb7bf63toHF15Fb8Apg", "user_id": "VdkAX9khigCjpMGuMNWYMQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "My colleagues and I had dinner here recently and had a mixed experience.  The food and service had some hits and misses.The waitress was a bit scarce and did not come by as often as she should.  It took her a long time to take our order.

And loud. Not sure how French bistro it is... There's nothing intimate about it. But the food is certainly authentic. Upon seating and cocktails ordered, crusty bread and small bowls of warmed pistachio nuts are served. An annoyance is that bread plates didn't seem to be used, so crumbs and buttery knives were all over the place. For appetizer, I ordered the beet salad. Bite sized chunks of chilled red beets, served over a schmear of goat cheese sweetened with honey. This was delicious. Beets were firm and tart/sweet and the goat cheese just sweet enough to complement the tartness of the beets. My favorite bistro entree is steak friites, so that's what I had here.  The flank steak was prepared medium rare, exactly as ordered. The beef was covered in finely chopped caramelized onions, and served with a pat of seasoned butter on top.  Often I see steak frittes served sliced, but in this case was plated whole. The meat was fork tender and mouthwateringly good. The frittes were somewhat of a disappointment, as they weren't much different than standard fast food fries. Could use some garlic and herb seasoning to make them memorable.  They were good, and a huge serving, but not special. No room for dessert this time, although the creme brulee served to our neighbors table looked and smelled great. This is an expensive spot. The food is authentic and delicious and the setting is beautifully designed. Definitely a place to go for the experience."}, {"review_id": "9TQwPiI8YiJTPJ4Z7Vtgyg", "user_id": "dnNXirfyr8xcUS6E56oRIg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "For brunch I ordered a croque madam ($18.95). Both the fried egg and accompanying sauce, while delicious, came out lukewarm. I suspect the dish had sat around before serving. The accompanying fries, however, tasted exemplary. These thin fries had the perfect amount of crisp and salt, and did not seem oily. They set the bar for the humble french fry. However, an exemplary side does not redeem the main entree. Breakfast, especially eggs, evokes an image of a hot, just off the skillet meal.

Trust me. And you must have a latte made by Enrique himself! Beautifully appointed restaurant with a stellar staff from the kitchen, wait staff, runners, busboys and all the way to the hostess desk in true excellent  Keller style. The food here also personifies all of the greatness Chef Keller puts into each and every dish he creates and cultivates. Not per se level, but then again I've only experienced those kinds of dishes and level of service at only 2 other establishments but I digress, however everything was phenomenal. This late night, we shared an array of hors d'oeuvres, small plates and desserts. Special small plate of the night was a petite bone marrow with confit whole garlic cloves. Truly unctuous and delectable. The foie gras lobe was beautifully seared and delicately presented. The crispy cube of pressed sweetbread was beautifully crisp on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. Placed on a generous mound of the fluffiest whipped potatoes, it was a beautiful pairing. The classic escargot topped with housemade flaky pastry puffs was melt in your mouth delicious with the right balance of butter and garlic. I'm a sucker for ordering deviled eggs whenever they are on a menu and they did not disappoint. Ordered a bowl of their house cured olives and sauteed spinach to round out the meal and they surely did the job. For dessert a generous portion of decadent chocolate syrup drizzled ice cream profiteroles and a run and citrus soaked sponge cake with crème fraîche ice cream completely hit the spot. Looking very much forward to enjoying another meal here very soon."}, {"review_id": "gZHU2opX43KPFUsxKd9BEQ", "user_id": "0MFiXakgg3_W0Gmquloa2g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Celebrity Chef? Check. French froufrou and hoity-toity-ness? Check. \"You're paying for the experience, not the food\"? Check. Here's my take: The reason why The Venetian is beautiful in its architecture and design is because it's supposed to distract you from the incredibly mediocre food found at Bouchon. You feel fancy at The Venetian, therefore the food you paid for has to be fancy......right?Here's what Bouchon does well:- Service is on point. Our server was extremely attentive, friendly, and happy to answer any questions we had about whatever dishes they had to offer. Plus he folded our napkins whenever we headed over to the restroom, making us feel all fancy and stuff.- The French Onion Soup. Delicious but a little bit of a clustermunch to actually eat. Would still recommend.Here's what Bouchon needs to work on:- The rest of the food. Cold and hard bread, skimpy portions of cold cuts, and a surprisingly loose crème brûlée. My steak took a while to come out (about an hour after getting our appetizers) and when it finally did it tasted like a regular steakhouse steak. Nothing terrible but definitely not worth the asking price.Oh and I'm not sure if they know it but, despite its name, the French fry is not French. I feel like I shouldn't have to say this but...if you're charging this much money for a 9 oz Ribeye...don't put a heap of fried potato sticks on the plate. It becomes less \"French Bistro\" and more \"Outback Steakhouse\".Overall, if you're in the area...just walk around inside The Venetian and then lose yourself to a Vegas buffet."}, {"review_id": "qJWC9bvD6pD_a1JYjcAsTg", "user_id": "g56GUAlsFasjO39EZzsvsQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "STAY AWAY!!!

Aug 3, 2017.Bouchon is a very nice way to have a great meal and a great time. This was the first for us eating dinner at Bouchon. Here's the story:Cocktails. Pricey but exceptionally well made. We enjoyed both the 1806 Old Fashioned and the Knob Creek Manhattan. Both changed my life, meaning I replicate their formula on a regular basis at home. A life-changing change.Apps enjoyed included deviled eggs, mixed greens salad and the tomato salad. These, plus the exceptional bread and butter were a good start to an already good evening.Entrees enjoyed included the swordfish, steak frites, gnocchi, and poulet (chicken). Each was seemingly simple but prepared in exceptional manner and presented accordingly. No complaints... and all dishes were wiped clean with a second round of bread. Rather impolite of us, but why not... we recommend enjoying every bite offered.Dessert... profiteroles and chocolate bouchons. Wonderful.  And for me, I can't recall if it was coffee, regular or Irish. Whichever it was I was a happy diner.A warm thanks to Coby and the team in the kitchen!"}, {"review_id": "i53orsoEHcd9SC-UcCAO_A", "user_id": "FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "A wonderful dinner with excellent attention to detail. The food this place serves is amazing. The epitome of French cuisine. My husband and I wanted to celebrate the Holidays on the strip, since he is obligated to work the actual Holiday, the weekend of, offered a great package deal and we couldn't pass it up. Thus, we're spending a great weekend at The Palazzo and celebrating with food. Bouchon has been on our bucket list for many years. Tonight, it met all our expectations. We started with one of our favorite cocktails, the old fashion, Bernheim Wheat Whiskey, Turbinado, Orange Bitters, Angostura, Orange Peel, on the rocks. It's really good but strong, will certainly knock you socks off. They bring the baguette bread to the table shaped like the wheat leaf, butter, mustard and pistachios. We get our first app order, Grand Plateau--1 lobster, 16 oysters, 4 shrimp, 8 clams, 10 mussels, and ceviche. All very fresh, the oysters are small but they are from different regions and are generally small. I don't know exactly where, I just remember two came from Washington state. I get the French onion soup, one of my favorites and my husband got the salmon tartar. My soup is dark brown, rich, warm with caramelized sweet onions with beef jus, country bread & Comté cheese.  The salmon tartare surrounded with hard boiled eggs, red onions, capers & crème fraîche, served with toasted croutons. It need just a bit of mustard to knock it up a notch. For my entree I got sautéed Idaho rainbow trout with grilled cauliflower in brown butter. My husband got the roasted chicken with Savoy cabbage, roasted parsnips, bacon lardons & chicken ju and side of potato. Both where savory good. By this time both of us are stuffed, but could not leave without the best part, a little dessert. Chocolate mousse and Lemon sabayon tart. Ooh so tart but so sweet, just the way I enjoy lemon tarts. I tried the chocolate mousse but couldn't appreciate it after starting the lemon tart. Our server and his team where very attentive and courteous. Our courses where cleared promptly and water glasses filled when half empty. Overall, great meal and what we expected our experience to be.

The bread was fluffy and delicious with a great crust and the pistachios were a hit with our table!! You know you're in for a great french meal when you can trust them to get the bread right.We ordered:Escargot: Cooked and served just the way escargot should be with a perfect puff pastry on top! Pig ears: MY FAVORITE. And just $11!! If you're a fan of pig ears or chicharrones or anything with pig flavor these are a must order. I wish I could have an order of these every day!!Foie gras: Perfectly cooked and fatty and tender with no sinew running through. Hubby says it might be the best foie he's every had!Salmon tartare: Light flavor and a nice balance to all the fatty items.Mussels: Super chubby mussels and a very flavorful broth! Prepare to ask for more bread to dunk in.Salmon with spetzle and beet butter: Surprisingly good! Salmon is usually pretty plain but the spetzle was perfect and the beet butter genius.Service was very good and the manager even came by at the end to apologize for a dish coming out late but we were sharing everything family style and didn't even notice.All in all a great meal!

For the main entrée, the boeuf bourguigon - red wine braised short ribs with French round carrots, Tokyo turnips, pearl onions, bacon lardons, and fingerling potatoes - was savory and tender. The veggie accoutrements helped soak up some of the juicy goodness emanating from the beef.
