It was highly rated and looked cool. Also if we drove all night I figured we'd make it there by the time it opened at 10. So met the owner, his mom and Finch(the dog). Two of which had a birthday last night! Everyone was super friendly and of course being an animal lover I was swooning. This place looks really cool inside too. I'd love to end up back there one day!When finding it the surrounding area doesn't look like it would House a great eatery like this one. I got the chorizo waffles. They were excellent!Anyway I highly suggest stopping by if you're in the area."}, {"review_id": "ADPFaZeW1FWodKI7_LfdfA", "user_id": "FMXBbottjIZ5_b783zX1Jg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "If this was my neighborhood pub and I knew the regulars or the bartender then maybe I could get on the band-wagon and give 4 or 5 stars, but paint me as \"meh\". As people have stated it does have a great view of KCMO from an outdoor patio, especially at night. I am familiar with the space since I had been here a few times in it's past life and it is definitely more open and bright now. The waitress didn't really seem to care if we were there or not. We had to ask for a coffee refill, and was then told that it would take 5 minutes or so to make more; really!? - it's brunch - you shouldn't let the coffee pot or a customers mug run dry on a Sunday morning. We also had to go ask for the check after sitting coffee free again and with no follow up service for 15 minutes. On a positive note; they are using Blip Roasters for their coffee service.As far as interior design; it was done on the cheap, just strands of white Christmas lights hanging down the walls and some uncomfortable metal barstools at about 6 wooden high-tops and a bar with 8 or so seats.I ordered the dulce de leche waffles. An underwhelming waffle, drizzled with a tablespoon of caramel sauce, a sprinkle of cinnamon and covered with whipped cream. My buddy had the chorizo waffles and proclaimed: \"they're fine\".If I could walk here, then I'm sure I would be raving about what a hip little out-of-the-way neighborhood pub I get to frequent, but it is not a destination location. If you are driving to get here from the Missouri side, you have probably passed 10 or more better places along the way. If you are looking for a skyline view with your beverage, grab a bottle of wine and head down to Kaw Point."}, {"review_id": "f6qU1ZzhyRqiB95SIDrOzw", "user_id": "aVBZ6TW7o3Lx0BjplVYF6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "Awesome view and vibe at this cozy spot.

When I was driving here I was a little confused about the location as it's in the middle of a neighborhood, but was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. Came in on a Friday for happy hour and it wasn't busy at all but it picked up as the night went on. Good choice of craft cocktails. Only got the guacamole app, but it was great. Had some flavored beers I hadn't tried before, chia high and salted caramel, you should def try those, they were yummy. Overall great service and def a place I would go back to. Patio area was nice and with a great view!"}, {"review_id": "Vyzk5codpQsx9apm183t8A", "user_id": "pSKCLwZilYU1yp4JpHSOSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "A beautiful remodel, light & bright. The brunch menu served all day. There are quite a few selections. If you aren't vegetarian try the sweet potato hash (has bacon). It is so darn good. I had the salmon sandwich with good sized piece of salmon. It was cooked perfectly and served with an avocado spread. The side was the awesome hash.The drink prices are very reasonable in comparison to other Metro bars. We had a great conversation about a liquor we were using for a holiday drink. The bartender, Brandy, is super friendly and very happy to talk cocktail talk."}, {"review_id": "jJ9CX2jjkTUDALv38AMZhw", "user_id": "IpvssHjj-IH4M5Z7xD1Ucg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2017", "text": "After Jarachos, we stopped by this place in KCK. The patio view was breathtaking! You could see the whole city from across the river. We met the owner of the bar, Daniel who was super down to earth and gave us the background of his bar. It has been opened for three weeks now. Super clean and well kept up place! He said he is working on a great Brunch and Happy Hour Menu. We are looking forward down the road for this hidden gem and will be returning back soon!!!The only downside was our bartender... he was super nice but didn't seem very social with us. He didn't seem to know how to make my friends drink either since he had to google it up. I  mean I get it, they just opened up and maybe he was still getting trained to make cocktails? Seems like him and the owner are friends so I'm not sure if he was there to support his business or was actually a bartender. The drinks that the owner made were very good though. Overall, good place to hang out with friends and decent drinks. We will be back soon!"}, {"review_id": "JPYQK35nlxC7L8bHeM-7Tg", "user_id": "5qwqoKnKgzY9lUA1D_fPyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "What a gem !!!

It's situated in the middle of the Strawberry Hill neighborhood - really no other businesses on the block. The brick building was originally a little grocery store. It's been renovated nicely and it's very cute inside - plus the patio view is killer.The food menu is small but I love that there are vegetarian and healthy options and everything is very reasonably priced. They're now open for lunch during the week and brunch on the weekends and there are also some happy hour specials.There are only a few beer taps (6 maybe?), so cocktails are really where Mockingbird shines. There also seems to be something fun every night of the week - game night, tiki night, comedy on Thursdays, etc.All-in-all this is a great little spot for a date night or small group get together. Don't be shy of the KCK address - it's not more than 5 minutes from downtown KC just on the other side of the West Bottoms."}, {"review_id": "Fy9I1mxUUJiCkG38llA2-g", "user_id": "DneijAbp13tGi-bZ3OHTRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "This hidden gem did not disappoint!

The location is hidden (gotta drive thru at least 2 neighborhoods to get here), but well decorated, as is the inside space. The atmosphere is chill, nostalgic, and current all at the same time: old video games are in a tiny corner space with comfy seats, and the overall space is small but versatile (a bar, patio, and table settings are avaliable). Craft and well drinks are offered, as well as wine, beer, and food. Long story short, it's  a great place to come and get away or connect with others.

Keep in mind, this was my first visit, but it will not be my last. I have already invited girlfriends to meet me on the patio for happy hour and that reminds me, do they have a happy hour? The vibe and aesthetic is pretty much coffee shop meets bar if a coffee shop only had bar/high top style seating. The colors are bright and cheery, there is a good amount of sunlight from the front windows and the reclaimed wood is all light chestnut colored. The patio in itself has a stellar view and is also very wood heavy and seemingly smoker friendly with ash trays on each table, a plus for some of my girlfriends. The bar is a little small and crowded, at first I distanced myself from the business men who were drinking domestic beers and watching Polaris Fox Midwest Baja 500 Racing but after the men cleared out the female hairdressers from down the street came in the mood shifted. It became what a bar should be, a place of lively conversation, neighborhood pride, and a nicer place to wash down drinks than the comfort of your own home. This is when the bartenders presence also began to grow on me, before hand he was really favoring one of the \"I still have my tie on just left work guys\" and wasn't really paying much attention to anyone else at the bar. But after the happy hour crowd thinned out, okay cleared out there were only three of em there, he really warmed up and held a nice conversation with us gals. The drinks were a little overpriced but offered nice pairings however, it is worth mentioning the bartender did have to reference the drink menu quite a few times even though it only contained about 10 cocktails. I had a huckleberry lemonade vodka drink made with local 360 huckleberry vodka and a house made lemonade and simple syrup mixer. I also tried the caipirinha which was okay but didn't have the same punch as the ones at Taste of Brazil. It is worth mentioning it was a higher quality cachaça than I was used to so, maybe it was just smoother and at $7 this was the cheapest drink on the menu. Each of the whiskey drinks I sampled were decent, one was a bourbon riff with lemon and honey and bitters and the other was a similar drink, a variation of an old fashioned with maple syrup and lemon. Both were tasty but I had sipped better elsewhere and the whiskey was Makers Mark which is fine but with so many fabulous KC whiskeys it was a bit odd. All in all this is an off the beaten path bar worth visiting, TVs don't have a domineering loud and obnoxious presence which lets conversation shine and makes this place hold all of the makings of one of those quintessential sitcom bars where groups of friends can go to hang out and catch up on the workday happenings and community gossip as well. Thank you mockingbird for making me go with my heart on this one!"}, {"review_id": "WLVpfhsT3cQD7REj_Go88w", "user_id": "-vjwjRIgtwzRCaINwuKE8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "Decent little bar with an incredible view of the city!

If you have too then Mockingbird is your Reagle Beagle. It's a neighborhood hang out with class. The owners live upstairs and the service and staff are equal to the homey relaxed welcome. In the warmer months sit on the patio. It has the whole KC skyline as a backdrop. Inside is clean with twinkling lights dripping down the walls and a little stage that gives local artists a welcomed place. The menu is fresh and creative. They are big fans of avocados and very generous with them. This is one of our (and our kids!) favorite brunch spot too, especially when Finch (dog) is laying around.
