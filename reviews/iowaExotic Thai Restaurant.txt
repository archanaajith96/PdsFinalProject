The restaurant is visible from the 53rd street. There was enough parking outside. We were seated quickly.We ordered Thai Wonton. They were like Indian Samosas but with a sweet chilli sauce. Tom Kha soup and Chicken vegetable soup were nice.For the entrée, we ordered Kang-Karee (veg) and Teriyaki Thai Chicken. Both of these were delicious.The service was good as well."}, {"review_id": "r_yGhWsl25ej3Wsg1jNj9A", "user_id": "tqtcKRZlA9xCgPfJMKSb1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "I really enjoy and eat lots of Thai, with my go to favorites being curries or Kang.I had the green curry this evening and all in all it was very tasty. The complexity and depth of the soup could have been deeper and I usually order mine 10 star hot. And that may be why I felt this just wasn't quite to my usual.Does this get a thumbs up 2nd visit. Yes, only I will ask for more heat on my return."}, {"review_id": "_ytS3_-kpckvuWDkevuDHg", "user_id": "PahD-lN-UEITk1DvPEoJ-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I am not from Davenport and had never heard of this place but I am so glad I found it! Service was fantastic. Food was amazing. I had the Bangkok Box lunch with chicken and vegetable soup of the day and chicken spicy basil noddle. Everything was great. The crab cheese puff was not too sweet and didn't have a harsh cream cheese flavor. Thai crudite(salad) was slightly spicy and I loved the vinaigrette dressing.  Noodles were perfect with a hint of sweetness. Loved the middle Spivey sauce which was fish sauce and chili's. WOW! I will be back."}, {"review_id": "BRo0PtSkFQbLcTuanYfunQ", "user_id": "A-knGXCYAXkwZ8-iNnt3jQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Best Thai I have ever had and I really enjoy Thai.

We weren't sure what to expect when visiting Exotic Thai Restaurant, but we're very pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is very nice. Easy parking. Friendly service. Delicious fresh food.

The restaurant was well lit and, in spite of its location on busy 53rd street in Davenport, relatively easy to access. The menu was extensive, and we were seated immediately upon our arrival even though it was 6:00.Everyone in our party seemed pretty happy with their food. The spicy basil noodles I ordered were excellent, but here's the catch: they were no better than the spicy basil noodles I get at my favorite Thai restaurant in Moline but cost four dollars more. In addition to the high entree prices, someone ordered a hot tea not realizing that the tea bag would cost $3.50.  Many people I know consider Exotic Thai, a sister to the very popular Lemongrass Cafe, to be the best destination for Thai food in the Quad Cities. I would agree that it's good, but I'm not sure whether 'good' is enough in a market saturated with good Thai restaurants. I'll probably see what else is out there, in between visits to Thai Flavors in Moline, before returning to Exotic Thai."}, {"review_id": "kzXfPT800o4O_9jRpY-pNg", "user_id": "rzHSyNGFJWGOYHbXzogJKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2017", "text": "Stopped by here on a Monday night on a whim.Service was awesome, decor was nice as well.We had the Me graa ti, drunken noodles and spicy basil noodles.All were excellently prepared, extremely fresh, and very athletic.

Thai Food is a nice blend of spice and exotic flavors. Hence the name, \" Exotic Thai.\" This cozy place is inviting with friendliness. The service-friendly and fast. The decor-traditional yet modern. The prices-not bad. The location-it's kinda tricky but it's in a plaza right off the main road. The food-really food, nice authentic Thai flavors and the food presentation is attractive.**Note: If you are looking for somewhere \"Exotic\" to take your date and you live in this area or you are visiting...this is the place to come.So, check it out...I had the Pad Thai, the Tom Kai Kai and the Thai Iced Tea...all where so good and flavorful. I also had this Thai dessert, which was oddly strange but good!!!
