We arrived after nine and had no problem getting seating and served. Our waitress was Mallory - she is great!! She was knowledgeable, super friendly, and very efficient. The company should be very proud to have her!I had the veggie burger, although I definitely almost got the vegetable curry. The veggie burger was a unique, almost like jackfruit, and was seasoned well. The whole wheat bun wasn't overpowering. I would order more roasted red pepper mayo (made in house!) on the side next time.My friend had the roti roll, Caribbean medley, and the Caribbean soup. He inhaled the soup! We would have loved a roti roll option with chickpeas instead of chicken - just a suggestion!Also, they leave the water pitcher on the table Which is ALWAYS points for us. It's also a lovely shape. PROS: Service was excellent. Mallory is delightful and very apt. Food is delicious. Reasonable prices. Plenty of options on the menu. Vegetarian choices are incredible. Portions are good sized. Very tasty!CONS: Not really a complaint, but if you're there late it may take about 20 minutes for the food to come out. We didn't mind whatsoever, absolutely worth it, and I think it's a sign of their fresh food being made to order."}, {"review_id": "ijCAb_xzb-egBRW9xWA31Q", "user_id": "4eM9IUG7j3AOSEGxbyaxYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Excellent dinnerHad the jerk chicken, wow moist, outstanding flavor. staff is top notch.

The server was great and very patient with us as our party trickled in over about an hour. Our server kept on top of all of our requests and kept the drinks and food flowing just as they should be. I had the Jamaican ginger beer to drink. It was very good and had a good flavor. Similar flavor to other ginger beers but just a bit stronger in flavor and it had alcohol so that was a bonus. I had a sip of my friend's rum punch and it was as strong, sweet, and appealing to the eye. I'm always a sucker for a colorful drink with a fancy garnish.We had the jerk chicken wings appetizer for the table. I tried a small bite as I am not a huge chicken wing fan, and the jerk chicken flavor was out of this world. I will have to try on the other jerk chicken dishes they offer next time I come here. They serve jerk chicken pretty much every way you can think of it: appetizer, salad, sandwich, and main dish.After reading other reviews, I had my heart set on the Cuban sandwich. However, I decided to try a dish that was supposed to be a popular Caribbean dish that I probably couldn't try anywhere else in town called the Roti Wrap. Roti is a Caribbean flatbread similar to naan or pita bread. The filling of the wrap was chicken and potato curry. This is probably one of the best, most flavorful wraps I've ever had. Once I started eating it, I was instantly happier and that's always a sign of a great meal. The flavor was not too overpowering and the filling had just the right buttery texture to balance out the Roti flatbread. As a side, I opted for the callalo soup which was not my favorite but that might be my taste buds and not because it isn't good.The menu had a lot of Caribbean influence, but also offered some dishes less adventurous eaters will like too like a NY strip and mac and cheese."}, {"review_id": "3ZO3C_F5Jkcykpa2kthr_A", "user_id": "uU4kW8eNwga05oKpPTxI7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/7/2017", "text": "Loved this place and can't wait to go back to Tulsa so I can eat there again! Walking in, it is very modern and you can tell it's popular for a reason. I will say the hostess left something to be desired, she was busy but didn't write our name down and never came back to us. Luckily, we found a seat at the bar and just ended up eating there since she never came back to seat us at a table. The service was more than made up for by the bartenders. Both were super nice and friendly, providing excellent service. Food wise, I loved the spices and flavors in each dish. I got the snapper.  The spices in the snapper were balanced out by the pickled veggies on top. I normally don't like beans but the red bean rice was pretty good. The plantains rounded out the meal with some sweetness."}, {"review_id": "_HESl5KWlvhXsWNBu1G8og", "user_id": "Ko01Bph_vOdLw0BGvn_Sew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/15/2017", "text": "This restaurant is one of my favorite spots downtown (Archer & Main). It offers tasty Caribbean-inspired items specifically from the island of Dominica. The space itself is very nice without losing its comfy-feel. I absolutely love the colors and pictures on the wall. The owners are siblings, Eben and Ilana, and they are always super attentive and friendly. The customer service is always top-notch as well. Their house-made biscuits are SO good and their jerk chicken is my favorite (it comes with corn too!). Every Tuesday night they have their fried jerk chicken for only $12. Their desserts and drinks are really tasty as well! Every second Monday of the month, they donate a portion of their sales to a particular local nonprofit. They also have live music every second Thursday of the month. My favorite is when they bring out a latin jazz band. Reservations strongly recommended for these days!"}, {"review_id": "K9oG-Rxa0PiASpcsLz-kLA", "user_id": "6zlZ1parHLLesxvle5JA6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Delicious!  And great service.  I've eaten here on both of my recent trips to Tulsa.  And I have a feeling this will be habitual."}, {"review_id": "ggcoig37q8myB9rim-TdGg", "user_id": "FJcrgVKdLdi5mXt8ymu5iw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "For the ambience and the menu, I honestly assumed this place would be more expensive.

I have had Sisserou's bookmarked for awhile and decided to give it a shot. We went in around 615 or so and were able to get a booth without a wait. Our server was Lee. He did a great job. He was quick, friendly, and gave us a short history of the restaurant (cool story). I decided to order the Salmon Rasta Pasta and my wife had the Jerk Chicken. Our food was delivered fairly quickly and the portions are very large. We could have split an entree. My Salmon filet in my pasta was huge, delicious and was super fresh (they fly in all their fish from the Gulf daily). It may have been the best fish fillet I have had in Tulsa. The Jerk flavor on the chicken was delicious without being overly spicy. I have been to a couple of Caribbean islands and the food seemed very authentic.The restaurant is really clean and nicely decorated. The staff were friendly and quick.

The restaurant has nice decor and a very relaxed feel.I ordered the Jerk Chicken and she had the Baked Chicken. The jerk chicken had a nice spice but was not hot like some jerk chicken I've had in the past. For my taste, i would have preferred a little more heat. The dish came with corn on the cob and rice & beans. The corn was great. The rice & beans were rather bland and needed salt.Her baked chicken came with steamed broccoli and mac & cheese. The chicken tasted like it was cooked on a rotisserie. Very moist and tender. The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. My only negative was the booth we sat in was rather tight for four adults.  Will ask for a table the next time we come."}, {"review_id": "8fpNw-aVR8IUnE5JcJiD_Q", "user_id": "kLnJxPLmhEYTUcEx9y-x4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Absolutely delicious!

The bartender Victor is your waiter and also the one creating delicious new cocktails!   This night was a treat--a fabulous margarita made with roasted sweet corn (yes, seriously) and viejo tequila!  The rim was dipped in salt/cayenne which countered the sweetness perfectly!  I ordered the filet- it was cooked perfectly and excellent flavor, with a run glaze. It came with 2 sides, the yam/potato mash (delicious) and steamed veggies. My husband got the salmon special -- WoW. He loved it. It came with some awesome grilled vegetables.Usually I get so caught up reviewing the food I forget to talk about anything else!

I don't necessarily have an infinity towards Caribbean food but with reviews this good I was definitely going to try it. I had the Jerk chicken sandwich with sweet potato chips. The sandwich was delicious. The chicken had a wonderful jerk flavoring that permeated through out the chicken not just a seasoning. The chips were perfect. My husband had the Cuban pork sandwich; another great choice! The flavors were so tasty. I did pull the tomato from my sandwich and put it on the pork because it felt a little dry to me.  There was a side of mayonnaise provided but, I don't like mayonnaise, the tomato was perfect. We capped off a great meal with pineapple rum cake and a side of vanilla bean ice cream, So yummy! I'm part of the \"anti-moist bandwagon\" and usually refuse to use the word...but there is really no better option,  so I'll say, \"it was moist and spongy\"... The customer service was fantastic as well. We got greeted by the owner and made to feel like family by the bartender/server.  I can't wait to come back and try the pork tenderloin or the ox tail next time.* if I were going to drop a piece of advice, I would suggest changing the music to a modern stream.  I know it's a Caribbean restaurant but the Jamaican tunes seem to lessen the fine ambience. Just my thought."}, {"review_id": "b0grnkckpgHMd9V9jVYkxg", "user_id": "ckV1I0OhGGqtIscEa4-TbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "4.5 star review. (why aren't there 1/2 stars ha ha!)

Very reasonable lunch prices. Ambience is trendy, and inviting. Coming back soon because I had to pass up the Ahi Tuna Salad which was my 2nd choice. Pass on the burger joint and come here!

My husband had the oxtail. He loved it. I had a bite and it was very flavorful, probably because the meat is cooked on the bone.
