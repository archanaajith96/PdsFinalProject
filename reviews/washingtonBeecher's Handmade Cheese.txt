That is a 1/10 spice, yall. If i sneezed into it it'd probably be spicy. not the best mac n cheese i've had in my life but also not bad! pretty pricy at $6 for a small palm's size cup of maybe 20 penne pasta noodles but i don't blame them for charging that.my boyfriend got the smoked turkey sandwich with the original mac n cheese in it and that was toasted just right. crunchy and buttery on the outside and creamy mac n cheese and salty turkey on the inside. Not mind blowing but definitely warming to eat after walking around in a fish market all morning.tl;dr: i don't think you're missing out on the worlds best mac n cheese if you skip this place, but it's still pretty cool to go, just to see them flip those cheese logs around and around."}, {"review_id": "U2Zzh8Dgi5ITcbaww1E11w", "user_id": "SsgDGJWBNvefjY0z8XsVCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Heard so much about Beecher's Handmade Cheese.

This is due, primarily I presume, to their cheese, Beecher's Flagship Cheese. Slightly tangy and absolutely nutty, this small tub of mac n' cheese was bursting with flavors.My cousin also told me to get the crab mac n' cheese, but unfortunately, they were out when we were there.The BREADZEL was a cheesy pretzel and it was the cheesiest yummiest pretzel.There is a small table with free samples so you can taste other cheese flavors. The \"Beecher's Flagsheep\" was also very good.There is a counter facing the glass-enclosed \"cheese-making operations\" on site and it was entertaining to watch while eating your food.The seats on this counter were cute: milk cans!For sale at this location, is a mac n' cheese-making kit complete with the different kinds of cheeses they used to make their mac n' cheese... but for you to make when you get home!"}, {"review_id": "VOnJxl8GealR6XoIwpn0YQ", "user_id": "NRYJBguIFH3EtWeAdarkrw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "When my friends and I waited in line, we heard someone say, \"You haven't tasted Mac and Cheese until you try this one.

Anyways, I was proven wrong lol.FOOD: Originally, when my friends and I came here, we decided to get the grilled cheese, but then we heard that guy talk about the Mac and Cheese so we had to get it. At this point, we just tried it to try it. We weren't expecting much and we were already full because it was only noon and we had already eaten at like 3 places (we really love trying new foods). So, we finally got the Mac and Cheese and it was really good. The cheese is a little grainy, but you could tell they use straight up real cheese. Not only that, but they use so much cheese that it tastes like a legit pasta dish.Tip: If you walk to the back, there's a bunch of cheese that you can sample."}, {"review_id": "Qwz_SDzm2xh_Y6vrV1xLOA", "user_id": "DYDbzLvtOKYo1KaGo-aR7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Must try when you visit Pike's Place Market!

The price is steep, I paid around $6.75 but it was incredibly decadent and delicious. I especially loved the gooey, thick sauce that it comes drenched in and the mild chili powder spices in it!

Hell, some would probably say cheese makes life worthwhile. This is a yelptastic fact proven every time I devour a small white container of Beecher's Mariachi Mac & Cheese. It's Penne pasta dripping with a creamy blend of roasted Anaheim Peppers, Veggies, and Beecher's Flagship Cheese. This is Beecher's original location and, even though it opened less than 15 years ago, Beecher's has become a staple of any visit to Pike Place Market or Seattle. You can actually watch the semi-hard cow's milk cheese being made in two huge vats right on site. The process takes 15 months, but don't worry because they have plenty of samples to try and cheeses to buy on site, too.Of course, like any good mouse trap, Beecher's lures you (and a horde of tourists) in with a free small square of cheese. Once you taste it, the trap's been sprung ... like Dave Chappelle shouting, \"Gotcha, Beecher's!\"My advice? Get some of the Mac & Cheese for now and scarf it down while watching new cheeses being made behind the big glass windows. Then, buy a 1-lb. or so cheese to take home as a Seattle memory ... and then come back in an hour or so to buy another because you couldn't resist the first pound and ate the whole thing while walking around Pike Place Market.On the way out, take a picture (because it will be the only thing from the place to make it home with you) and yell \"Beecher's\" as it's snapped."}, {"review_id": "AOmlXVx9v9JY8Vr1GvS8oQ", "user_id": "3UhNWpWSlqhbQdAH5XvKKQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This place is crazy busy all the time.  The best thing is to order to go.  We crammed ourselves into an uncomfortable counter stool to eat our meal.  We ordered the mac and cheese which was good.  I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich which I thought was okay.  The combo of cheeses was not to my liking.  And it was not as melted as it could be.  The bread seemed greasy as opposed to toasty and it did not complement or make the cheese taste any better.  The curds were tasty and the mac and cheese was good.

I came back on Monday morning and there was no line, thankfully. I ordered a large of each of the mac & cheese. Came up to about $24. They have 2 kinds. A reg one and a mariachi. Both were really good but I loved the mariachi one more. It had corn and roasted chili in it. Both were SUPER creamy and flavorful. I'm kinda sad that I didn't order the crab sandwich. Will definitely have to next time. You don't want to miss out on Beecher's, especially if you're a cheese fan. They also have cheese for sale, which has a separate line.

The first, I had a quick taste of the infamous Mac and Cheese, nearly 9 years ago and it has been in the back of my mind ever since. I don't think I can stress it enough, but I don't particularly like or prefer mac and cheese as my meal of choice. But Beechers is the exception.Their mac and cheese is the best I ever had. I got a small cup of the original mac and cheese and regretted not getting a bigger cup. Since they use different cheeses and a blend of spices, you don't get tired eating it. I also got the smoked ham sandwich, it was tasty but you can get it anywhere. I recommend getting just the mac and cheese.There is always a line for this place, but it goes by relatively quick. It's cool that they have big windows so you can see them make the actual mac and cheese. The only downside is that because they are located near Pike Palace, there is not  a lot of room to sit and eat.

I don't know what types of cheeses they used in it. I initially didn't care for it much at first. I saved the other half and brought it home and ate it for lunch the next day at work.

We came here on two different times during our weekend here because we stayed at the Thompson which is less than 1000 feet from the best of Pike's Place.On our first visit, we ordered their grilled cheese and just watched the cheese-making process. On our second visit, I had already read that the mac and cheese was the thing to get. So on our last day in Seattle, we had \"morning\" mac and cheese. The penne pasta they use picks up every bit of the melted cheese and it's definitely one of the best macs I've ever had.I only wish there were an easy way for me to bring cheese and cheese curds on our flight back to Atlanta. The next best thing was getting their cheddar crackers (which I like more than the honey wheat ones) so we could still take a bit of Beecher's back home with us. I hear they have another factory in NY (in the Flatiron district) so there's the possibility of finding supermarkets (Whole Foods, maybe?) that carry Beecher's cheese on the East Coast. Highly recommend visiting this place to have either a grilled cheese or some of their mac and cheese.

It's about $6 for a small cup; it's a little expensive, but boy is it totally worth it! It's a cup full of penne pasta smothered in delicious cheese. It's very simple, but it's done very very well.
