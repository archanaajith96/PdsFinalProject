When we arrived, it was pretty dead inside and seat yourself so our waitress didn't notice us right away, but once she did she was VERY attentive, so that didn't bother me in the slightest.Between us, we ordered the Fish and Chips, a burger, and the grilled cheese (with sourdough subbed for the wheat bread). I had the sweet potato fries with maple bacon butter on the side. The inside of the restaurant was really nice, and they had a cool patio with fire pits that we wished it was the weather for. It's interior was definitely welcoming and cozy for a meal or a drink without the atmosphere turning into a loud bar. The food was good, but wasn't outstanding enough to imprint on my memory. Between our meals, I preferred the fish as the main. It had a nice batter consistency and solid, clean fry flavor. My grilled cheese was good, but overall very mild. It needed a punchier cheese or more of the most flavorful in the blend to stand out more. Perhaps paired with their spicy tomato soup, which I didn't order, it would have been better. The sweet potato fries were good, but not the best I have ever had and the maple bacon butter was yummy, but it felt odd to be dipping into butter. I would have preferred a maple flavored sour cream instead. The bacon flavor was always more powerful than I'd have preferred, but it was a good, real bacon flavor. Overall, it was a fine stop for lunch. It was enjoyable, but maybe not too memorable."}, {"review_id": "MA8nq9KwZHzNb-HVosLxUQ", "user_id": "yFph5MjXMnvu3H3tgLjMJQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Since moving back to Rapid City, I've had the opportunity to have drinks, dinner and lunch there a number of times.  The atmosphere and drinks are always great, most staff is friendly and helpful, the food on average mediocre to okay. There are a few dishes on the menu that are unique - however there are much better places in Rapid City if you want really good food or something over-the-top, or are entertaining out-of-town and guests or clients. I do enjoy a few of the appetizer items. Murphy's has an advantage of location - however when I have a vote where our group eats - Murphy's typically is not even close to making the list."}, {"review_id": "xfg9JfsbAxxRHFvCxlFXBg", "user_id": "olwb8niK8z2AkAnhk17o4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Love this place!

Its in historic Rapid City so the location is really convenient.  The food is typical bar food but in a more upscale sense.  The food is solid.  I had the reuben and it was done wonderfully.  I was by myself and just sat the bar with no wait.  The staff is really friendly and it is obvious there is big local following.  Apparently, there is speak easy downstairs that I missed out on because its only open during the weekend.  I was only there on business for the week.  Definitely a go to if your in Rapid City."}, {"review_id": "HnP8B7m8ax3vGexNuPxMQg", "user_id": "Cg-mtLddNSzKUn7Y_btjdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Great food, great service, and a great selections of beers on tap.

Nice selection of beer, but the beer list was pretty vague with what was on tap so I went to look for myself.Had the shepherds pie. Quite good. It could stand to be a bit larger, but the flavor was great. Was pleasantly surprised it was lamb and not ground beef. Came in a reasonable amount of time.Citradelic on tap tasted exactly like it did from the bottle. Kudos."}, {"review_id": "hJMZuEPuYLkPuvy5mBdRGg", "user_id": "lUEpW7FdTy4YomHJTwIGlg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/23/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Food was good although a little pricey for \"bar food\".

I had a 23oz Buffalo Sweat stout from Tallgrass brewery in Kansas City. They had a test kitchen menu along with their regular menu so I had the Buffalo chicken grilled cheese with sweet potato fries and friend had blackened fish tacos. It said on the menu that they wanted customer feedback but neither server asked us and so hence my review here.... Both meals were excellent, the grilled cheese was stuffed with good sized chunks of chicken and the fish was cooked and spiced up just right.

There is plentiful seating and it's definitely kid friendly. There draught beer list is also long with a good variety. Our server was really nice, but very absent. She didn't come back once to check on us after we got our food. We weren't able to order a second beer until we were asking for the check. The food wasn't very impressive. My son had the kid grilled cheese. I had the Matt melt and my husband had the Murphy burger. My melt should have been awesome given all of the different ingredients, but it was lacking flavor. My husband's burger was over cooked."}, {"review_id": "rM7_6JNQqlQiaC5Dstb7-w", "user_id": "zRHQAeIMK2iTbjEqyzW4jg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "Atmosphere is totally chill. Our waiter, Bryce, was friendly and attentive. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and Murphy's grilled cheese with sweet potato fries. The absolute best sweet potato fries I've ever had and I'm serious about sweet potato fries. More like wedges, perfectly crisp and they come with Maple Bacon butter. Shut the front door...

The Dirty Chips with pulled buffalo chicken was my choice, the wife with Fish & Chips, and our buddy the Jake Burger.Everything arrived, and was pretty good.  I expected a little more from my appetizer, but it hit the spot despite it's mediocre look.Other than that I looked around and took in the environment.  It wasn't what my buddy quite expected.  He was thinking it would be a little more sports bar, but it had a little more class than one.  There were people here for the game, but it was a calm environment where people were there to chill.After another round of beers from their menu and a Hot Toddy with Tullamore Dew for me.  We all began to dwindle our conversation and make our exit.It was a chill Sunday, in a chill environment, with chill people, and Murphy's Pub & Grill helped to create the setting.  It was good, and I'll be visiting again in the future.(PS, this is a winter review, and I will revisit again when I have some afternoon patio time come summer.)"}, {"review_id": "gYz-0z8I0oF6IDzlBGkCBg", "user_id": "gxYjmyb31JtIE-SK3c4Fhw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "This place is a little bit pricey but it is delicious.
