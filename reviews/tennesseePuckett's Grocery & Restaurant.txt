Found this on Yelp and I'm SO happy I did! If you are looking for a hip place in the heart of Nashville with a down home feel and incredible Southern food, this is your place!The fried green tomatoes were the BEST I have ever had. Besides wonderful food, Puckett's has lots of history in Nashville. It has been here for over 60 years, serving this great town. LOVE the warm inviting decor marrying rich woodwork with  industrial details and fixtures.What a cool place, can't say enough. Also we LOVED our waitress Lindsay, she models pure Southern hospitality. We felt like family!Can't recommend this place enough, will definitely be back next time we're in Nashville!"}, {"review_id": "srbp4e1Z3S1wazHbwVyNKQ", "user_id": "G1WtcPD-okGJ5ZW5NLxm3g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Solid 3.5 for lunch.We rode the free green Music City Circuit buses in from the Capitol/Farmers market area. Stopped the bus and jumped out at Church Street.FOOD ~$30 + tipMeat & 3 - ordered ribs, skillet Mac & cheese, turnip greens, and mashed potatoes w/white gravy (potatoes were a bit salty and dry, but adding the gravy with that bit of pepper helped balance it out). The sides were ok, rib was dry and definitely needed that sauce. Kids ordered fruit tea - it's sweet! They said the fries on the chicken tender plate were a 10/10! And they enjoyed the grilled cheese (as did the MIL) with fruit!Sister-in-law shared the Philly sandwich minus the peppers and onions with her husband and it was definitely tasty.Dessert was a shared fried brownie - wonderfully gooey with vanilla ice cream and some toasted barley or grains on top!WAIT / SERVICEGot seated almost right away when we walked in around noon with a party of 8.Super friendly servers, who were happy to accommodate, but who forgot a couple of things for our order. It wasn't a big deal, just remind them when they come to check in on you."}, {"review_id": "jRxcA8PZ0j0AoB7qMw2-5g", "user_id": "AraK4O9j7BFNkIiLmAaPlg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Standard breakfast fare- good and plentiful!

My husband had the biscuits and gravy.  The biscuit were flaky and the gravy abundant.  And the best part, only $4!  The coffee was a perfect medium roast that pleased both of us.  All of that for only $21 and excellent service!  I would put this at the top of the list for Nashville!"}, {"review_id": "jmdGLlKDqLFHjus1V9_dog", "user_id": "Q6h7l3gr7YByL-XhAeGP5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "We had a reservation at Puckett's for a large group, before a day of exploring and celebrating on Broadway (yes, I'm a local who was at a bachelorette party in Nashville). Puckett's is a great spot for visitors - they can get a taste of BBQ, it's in the heart of downtown, they take reservations, it's relatively inexpensive, and at night they have live music!WARNING: If you have a reservation, they will give up your table if your whole party is not there after 15 minutes. They are very busy!WARNING #2: Much to our dismay, you can't order off of the breakfast menu after 11 AM, even on a Saturday. This was a bit perplexing to us brunch-lovers.While the breakfast menu is off limits, the breakfast buffet is still available, which we all ordered. It includes: scrambled eggs, eggs with veggies, bacon, sausage links, hash brown casserole, grits, French toast casserole, fruit/berries/yogurt/granola, and maybe pancakes? everything from the buffet was pretty good - way better than typical buffet food. As they were very busy, the service was a little slow. It took some time to get a hold of our waitress for drinks and checks, and I can only image how the food ordering and serving would have played out. All in all, an easy and tasty place to eat in a bustling area. Next time I'll have to sample the lunch/dinner options."}, {"review_id": "WdOIMIbd6pZUsTteu-65kA", "user_id": "V3MobZ-Bvg-hnp7Y-QPcOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I walked into here my first day in Nashville thinking it was a grocery store and I really wanted an apple haha. I walked in, did a circle loop and walked right out. However, that was enough time for me to smell how good the food must be, and lo and behold, we were back for dinner the very next day. It was a Tuesday night and extremely busy, there were probably close to twenty people waiting for a table when we left. Luckily, we decided to go to an early dinner that night, while we hoped and prayed that the ticket prices to the Predators game would drop (they didn't).It took us a little longer than expected to be served, which was okay because the place was so busy, but once we were, the food came out right away, such was great, because I was starving? I had the pulled pork skillet over Mac and cheese, I mean come on! That's like gold plating gold. It was delicious. The pork was cooked perfectly, very rich with flavour. The portion size looks small but there are a ton of calories packed into a small skillet so it fills you up quickly. Also comes with a salad, such was great. My friend had a burger which was also good. Because we had an early dinner, we were too early to catch the musical performance, so I can't comment on that but it looked like it would have been good!"}, {"review_id": "4qXqYOY63CNoIaDfb4EjMw", "user_id": "n9EERJ-p22zg6ESKVFs3zw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I was upset that I needed to give Puckett's 2 stars because so many others have given it rave reviews.  Let me tell you about my experience though.The two of us walked over to Puckett's and it was 6 on a Saturday and we figured there would be a wait.  We were informed it would be something like an hour and a half.  We talked to them about carryout and they enthusiastically took our order and said it would be about 20 minutes.  The hostess also said reservations are needed a week in advance, which is kind of difficult when we're in town for just a few days.True to their word, our order was ready on time and we walked a few blocks back to our place.My wife had Puckett's BBQ platter and there was BBQ sauce on the side.  The sauce was great and we're thinking about stopping and buying some.  The menu said it came with homemade slaw.  There was no slaw.I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken, which the menu said was topped with white pepper gravy.  I was shocked to find that they forgot the gravy! Having no gravy made the chicken and the mashed potatoes dry.  It was like a big chicken nugget.  The green beans seemed out of a can.I think any restaurant should take as much care with their take out orders as they do with the ones served in the restaurant.  It wasn't as if I paid less.  Missing items isn't acceptable and missing the gravy changed the dish entirely.A real disappointment."}, {"review_id": "1QocSnquld-ivnUSDPwPSw", "user_id": "aGJnMKMTt0oy-kOewd0ysA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "We came to Puckett's in between lunch and dinner time on an unseasonably chilly Nashville day. We asked to sit in one of the booths, and the hostess kindly acquiesced - P.S. the booths are really long. Like really really long for some reason. Anyway, we really came to get away from the chill, and have a couple of drinks and snacks before dinner. Let's call it pre-dinner. My friends each got a flight of beer, and I got some sort a pear drink (it was like sweet fall in a glass). We got nachos and fried pickles and both were tasty, but really, I'm giving Puckett's five stars for our waiter - I can't remember his name, but he was young and considerate, he had the best suggestions, and he was super friendly.

Piggy Mac husband said it was too greasy and salty. He never says things are salty. Chicken fried chicken was awesome. Green beans were bland. Put some bacon in those things. Mashed potatoes were home style aka lazy mashed potatoes with skin in them. Personal preference I prefer my potatoes pealed. Cornbread would be better with out the jalapeno and served hot. Dessert... warm cookies with ice cream husband said cookies were under done so I would have liked them. The blueberry cobbler was pretty much just blueberries the cobbler bread part was missing.

We were there about 6:15. We were told about an hour to an hour and 15 minute wait. That was fine with us so we waited. We figured, every other restaurant would be about the same.  It was Easter weekend and Spring Break. We actually only waited a little over 35 minutes, so we were very happy. The hostesses were very kind. And very helpful when I asked a question about the menu. We were seated on what I'm guessing is typically the band strange when there is a band playing there. There were 4 tables on it. Our waitress was very kind. But, was not very attentive. It took awhile to get our waters. And then to get refills. And then to get the check. Once our food was delivered, we didn't see her again until we wanted the check. My mom ordered the smoked bologna sandwich with coleslaw. She said the sandwich was fantastic. It had a very good flavor, and they didn't skimp on the meat. It was a very thick slice. She said the coleslaw wasn't her favorite.  It, it was still good. I had the fried chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes, and jalapeño corn cake. Everything on mine had a great flavor. The chicken was almost too fried for me, but it was still very good. We were too full to try dessert, but the man behind us ordered a cobbler and it looked amazing.

They weren't taking same day reservations so we decided to take our chance and walk in, it was still relatively early (5:15 pm), as we approached there was a line out the door. Good (people wait to get in) and bad (they may not take walk ins or the wait could be long) signs but we ask and the wait is only 30 minutes. We waited at most 30 minutes before getting a seat but I think it may be longer later in the evening.Food: Wife was set on the southern fried chicken and I was debating the rib eye and or Ribs. We asked our server Austin what was the best two menu items he didn't hesitate to recommend the Smoked Meat Loaf and the Chicken Fried Chicken. When you server is that confident and he's not suggesting the priciest menu item you gotta go with it. I also wanted the whiskey flight (Tennessee versus Bourbon) and he recommended I go with the bourbon. The whisky was great and they were not small tasting pours! The meatloaf surprised me with it's depth of beefy flavor. The chicken fried chicken was also excellent. There was also these little corn pancakes that were very tasty when slathered with butter. We decided to carb splurge a little and ordered the blueberry cobbler ala mode which completed the meal (with two bulleit rye old fashioned to pair).Service: Austin took great care of us, all of his suggestions were spot on and we knew he wasn't trying to up sell us on our orders. He came by often to check on how were doing through out our dinner.Atmosphere: Relatively large restaurant with a mixture of tables and booths with a bar at the back. Lots of activity with a stage towards the front, we didn't stay long enough to enjoy the music but it's a great space.Value: Super value, Meatloaf was $15, Chicken was $14, everything was very affordable for the quality you receive. We did have 4 drinks which bumped up the price but my $22 whiskey flight was more like 4 individual whisky servings so that's more like 7 drinks!Overall: I may have to come back again before leaving town to order that Southern Fried Chicken, the front desk person said it was the best in townKeto: You can definitely stick to a Keto plan but it will take tremendous will power to stay away from the mashed potato or that little corn cake. It can be done but you'll need an iron will!"}, {"review_id": "mXuBVbypaKxA81W_7LLg-Q", "user_id": "HzRaMrqXUvIdV6u_qp07_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Great food and atmosphere!
