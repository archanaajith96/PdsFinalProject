Was hanging with a friend for a beer and decided to eat. He had never been so went with my suggestion to give it a whirl. Considering there is only street parking now we found spaces and were able to meet up. I was able to secure two bar seats near the window. My favorite spot is the bar at Boda. Just like the casual setting. But have been in he dining area and it's great too. We had a cocktail called Aries because that is my sign send thought it was a sign being my birthday is next week. Anything for a drink. . It was great. The bartender was so nice and attentive. When my friend arrived and decided to have the same drink I was having, I literally look up and down the bar and with a nod, a tip of my glass and a gesture toward my friend, he had a drink in front of him in no time. It must have been the alignment of the stars. My friend went with my suggestions to have the Quail Eggs and he ordered the duck and I had pad Thai. When the food arrived he was so impressed. And once he started eating he could not understand why he had never been to Boda. It was a nice casual evening where we enjoyed our meals, talked about the meaning of life and actually met some nice people sitting next to us. All in all a great night."}, {"review_id": "wwfA4QAFwKCIpbR8x8BLhg", "user_id": "VEkf1XMww4QvkiEzb_DJxA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This is a 3.5/5 for me.I ordered the Thai iced tea and it was TOO sweet, so I didn't bother with it anymore. It isn't like the Thai iced tea that I get from Asian restaurants back home in Boston.The fried squid was good, but they overdid it was the chili sauce (the kind of sauce you dip egg rolls in). I got the chicken entree with rice and it was really good. The fish sauce for the chicken dish, the waitresses asked me what level of spiciness from 0-4, I got a 2 and was a little disappointed because it didn't taste spicy at all, but that's not their fault. The bok choy was really good, but I wish they didn't drown them in super salty soy sauce.The skewers were okay, just don't wait to eat them when they cool down because they get super chewy...Service was okay. It gets REALLY packed and loud around 7:00pm, we came around 5:30ish and was glad that we did."}, {"review_id": "fm1PioxWqfGEUGscRzRaCw", "user_id": "HIlzzI-3e6ODLEnT3Ota8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Boda oh Boda.

How have I not been to Boda before! This place was absolutely fantastic. My husband and I decided one date night that we wanted to eat some Thai food and several friends had recommended going to Boda.We walked in and there was a little hallway with several people waiting for a table. We were kindly greeted by the host who took our names and told us that it would be about a 40 minute wait (which we expected given it was the weekend and prime dinner time). After taking our names, the host handed us a drink menu and offered to get us some drinks if desired.We sat down at some chairs in front of the kitchen to look over the drink menu, which had many delicious sounding cocktails. After about 10 minutes, the host came over to us to let us know that a couple was wrapping up their dinner and that he should have a table for us shortly. We were pleasantly surprised as we had expected to be waiting for a good 40 minutes.Within minutes we were seated at a cute little table in the back dining area. We were greeted by our server as she had already seen us with our drink menu and knew that we were ready to place our drink orders.I got a delicious vodka drink called the John Daly and this was super yummy. It was a ginger-peach infused vodka with elderflower, lemon & iced tea. It was like a luxurious alcoholic Arnold Palmer! We looked over the appetizers and decided to go with the crispy squid..... YOU MUST TRY THIS! I have had calamari at a ton of places, but this was some of the best. It was a perfect proportion of breading to squid, and the sauce it was in was absolutely PHENOMENAL (has a good zing to it)... Literally it was so good, I had to eat the lettuce garnish that the crispy squid was served on!For my meal, I went with the Kee Mao Noodles with chicken. Not sure if this is with every meal, but I was able to choose the spice level of my meal from a scale of 0-4. Being a person that loves spice, I went with a three. The meal was wonderful. After the first few bites, I thought I could have gone up to a 4 in heat, but by time I finished my meal, my nose was getting a little runny..... so a 3 ended up being perfect. Everything from the noodles to the chicken and vegetables was cooked perfectly. The portion was also great... at one point I didn't think I was going to finish (which is rare for me).I have to also say that the service and staff here is really spectacular. From the host to all the servers and bartenders, everyone was extremely friendly and working hard to provide exceptional service. It was really wonderful to see an entire team of great people that seem to really enjoy what they do.If you haven't been, I highly recommend you put this place on your \"to-go\" list!"}, {"review_id": "i-Li9mKnVmCAJcgjN5l5Dw", "user_id": "Fqb8xpHK1hN8pIgVB8NoGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Spur of the moment choice to go here for dinner was a huge hit.

I went here for my birthday because it was one of the only restaurants open at the time. Although I was skeptical at first, the food surprised me. Brussel sprouts are one of my favorite foods, so as soon as I saw them on the menu, I was sold. When I got my meal, they came glazed in an incredible sauce. I finished off a generous portion all by myself, and I would've eaten more. This place is usually hard to get into, there's not a lot of parking, it's pretty dark, and they don't serve lunch.

All of this time, I have been missing out. Well, better late than never.My husband and I are lukewarm about Thai food in general, but this experience has really changed our opinion. Not all Thai food is equal.First - the employees. Extremely pleasant and welcoming, but also focused on the business of ensuring customers are efficiently managed throughout the dining process. Matthew our server was FANTASTIC. Pleasant, patient with a warm personality. He was attentive to our needs as if we were his only table. We were not, we were there on a busy Saturday and he took time and care with all of the customers.Second - the atmosphere - I loved the space. It is tardis-like - much bigger on the inside. It has a warm feel to it, like I was dining in someone's rustic home. A lot of character in this space. They have done a great job fixing up this space.Third - the FOOD...oh my gosh, I woke up the next stay still thinking about everything from the sticky rice ball, to the quail eggs, to the crispy pork belly appetizer...everything made me so happy. It really is tough to eat while smiling a big smile. My noodle dish was fantastic - apparently so good, that I forgot to take a picture :( Everything we ordered was so fresh and the flavors were bright and rich. The portions are just right, not too big or too small and enough to share a bite with family and friends...if you can spare it.Because we had just come from the Maine Brewer's guild, we only had soda and water for beverages, but I can't wait to return to try some of the drinks off of the creative menu. Soda comes in cans...FYI. We had diet cokes. The water container never ran empty...actually I don't recall it ever being filled, but I know we were drinking a ton of water. I am guessing it was because we were all looking down at our dishes. :) Like an olympic swimmer doing the crawl stroke, your face is down most of the time, only on occasion turning up for a quick breath of air.Parking - well, it's the city. Be prepared to walk, pay (unless it is after 6pm). After consuming all of the delicious food, we welcomed the walk back to our car.If you like Thai food or non-fast food asian food. Please do give this place a try."}, {"review_id": "md8PiKzh7qQwczfIv995wg", "user_id": "Nv9mS3IYt6Hk9uBmJJttWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "The food here is very creative, but not overdone or overly complicated.

Me and my gf came for a late dinner; and it was quaint and lovely as ever. The place is small, but the wait wasn't too bad. The tapas are unique and some were quite pleasant. The quail eggs are a must there, so we tried them thinking they would be something good. No more than ordinary eggs to me. Just tasted like salted sunny sides, nothing much else really. We also tried the pork belly; arriving on skewers ready for consumption. They were a little rough, very chewy; not the way I'm used to eating pork belly. The Pad Thai though is Bomb! Loved every bite, we got it mild to please everyone.  But, I still loved it! Good flavor of fish and cashew, so nicely blended with crisp sprouts and beautifully cooked noodles. This is what we should've stuck with all night, or got two plates. Thanks Boda, I shall return for your late Pad Thai craves and local Maine beer, Cheers!!"}, {"review_id": "JL8QBREFYdLHLOjhmdtA2w", "user_id": "V-oKpS4lGRcAW7o3KkTcZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "Anytime someone asks me where I would like to go to dinner, I will probably always say Boda.

My husband and I had heard great things about Boda, so we decided to give it a shot and we hoped that this would be Maine's saving grace when it comes to Thai cuisine. When walking into Boda, we were instantly greeted by the host who stated that it would be about a 30 minute wait. It was clear that they were very busy with the hustle and bustle of waiters coming out of the kitchen with endless food and the small group of people that were also waiting to be seated. My husband and I sat off to the side of the bar where there is an open window where you can see some of the cooks making the food, which made for a cool vibe. As we waiting for our table, we were also approached by a bartender and were asked if we wanted a drink while we waited, which we thought was really nice, however, we decided to wait until we got seated. We were eventually seated after about 15 minutes of waiting, which was great. Our waiter promptly took our drink orders, to which I ordered the Thai Basil Tom Collins (just give me all the Thai basil and everything!!!) and it ended up being really good! The restaurant had about 4 items that were specials, which was tempting, but we opted for options on the regular menu. We started out with the crunchy squid for an appetizer and I ordered the Kra-Prao Chicken for my main course. The crunchy squid was amazing! It was in a spicy-sweet chili sauce and it was everything you hope for when you hear \"crunchy squid.\" My main course was good. The waiter asked me what I wanted as far as the heat or spice and I said 3 out of 4. I think I could have gone up to a 4 and I would have enjoyed my meal more. I was happy with it, but I was a huge fan of my husbands meal which was the Key Mao Noodles with chicken. Overall, my husband enjoyed our experience at Boda and would definitely come back. It ended up being Portland's saving grace as far as Thai food!"}, {"review_id": "WFa0TEMKIpKfYupWc6MFVw", "user_id": "Vje9AcZL9kPyFqgDvvISOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "How have I eaten at Boda so many times and never reviewed it?

Wow where to start? What a great meal. We were able to be seated right away on a Friday evening, which was great, and our waiter came by soon after being seated to greet us and take our drink order. For an appetizer we ordered the chicken wings (at the recommendation of the waiter) and for dinner my husband and I each got the pad Thai. The wings looked and tasted great! The pad Thai was some of the best I've had. It was presented in such an interesting way - wrapped up in a thin egg omelet. It was an innovative way to present a standard dish - except this was no standard pad Thai! It had glass noodles and was just so flavorful. The chili powder came on the side so you can make it as spicy as you like, my husband and I are both fans of spicy so we used all of our chili powder. Service was great.

Located outside of Old Port so you'll have to walk there if you're hanging out in that region. Small restaurant so be prepared to wait a little bit. Food is good (the duck is good, but wish the skin was crispier). The pork dish is phenomenal. The only thing I'll mention is that they have a dessert that sounds like rice pudding. It comes with a coconut cream to pour on top and the coconut cream is SALTY. Taste it before dumping it all over your rice pudding because if you don't love the sweet/salty combo, you might regret your decisions."}, {"review_id": "lWkK2cch0RnfAZEhL7-fEQ", "user_id": "GjamMoWQmwhiIv2ZxYbnQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2017", "text": "While planning for our first visit to Portland, I came across Boda and both my husband and I were incredibly excited.Knowing they didn't take reservations, we got there early before the doors opened...and joined the line of 15 folks waiting to grab a table. The interior is nice and, oddly enough, reminded me of that monument of American Thai food - Pok Pok - in Portland, OR.  Tables had enough room and the interior was very nice. We started off with cocktails. My husband got a Mai Tai which he deemed \"Good but not *his* Ma Tai\" - translation: too much fruit juice. I got the Thai Basil Tom Collins which was out of this world - I seriously want this recipe!We started with a Sticky Thai Rice Ball (NOMNOMNOM), Pork Belly Skewer (a little lacking in flavor and seasoning), and grilled octopus from the grill. My husband was over the moon for the octopus - which was very tasty. Then we split an order of the Woon-Sen Chicken Pad Thai - what a lovely way to elevate pad thai. The egg omelette that the pad thai was wrapped in was perfectly cooked and the glass noodles were seasoned to perfection. I loved that the raw bean sprouts, lime, ground peanuts, and chili flakes were served on the side so you could dress your serving as you wanted. We also split a braised beef dish (with tofu and mushrooms) that came with jasmine rice, some pickled veg, hot pepper oil, and Chinese broccoli - this was an amazingly tasting and soul satisfying dish.Really enjoyed our entire meal and are looking forward to heading back to try more of the menu the next time we're in town."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/boda-portland?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
