I had the chicken, fried okra, and as always I think every where I go I order Fried Pickles!! I cant get enough of them. My husband got a backed potato with meat on it and it was so big. He really enjoyed it. The customer service was amazing. The lady made sure we had enough stuff to drink and made us a to go drink. They were very nice here. I loved the red phone concept. You can call on the red phone when you are ready to order. That is a good idea, that way if your not ready then I don't feel like I'm wasting any ones time.  Also sometimes when You are sitting there, a celebrity walk in. I am a big hog fan so when the assistant coach Scotty Thurman walks in, it is a big deal at least for me. I am old enough to know all about Scotty and when he played etc. But however, My husband is fired!! He refused to get a pic for me LOL!!!Great place to eat we will definitely be here again!! Thanks for the great Service"}, {"review_id": "nBVRm1nUPkvtPb8WuN6_Dg", "user_id": "d2JRE-YQgW4hBvuhIYVxDA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "The fried pickles are incredible, and the cookies are good.Everything else -- the pulled pork and chopped brisket -- was a bust.

I love the location on Mission with there great breakfast and friendly service. The B&B location, however, is very disappointing. This tiny, hidden shack is more than unusual to get to and is quite dirty once you go inside. I seen cobwebs all over the place and a dark and dreary interior. The sauces are pretty flavorful but the meat is very dry and sits out for quite a while. I happened to look around the smoker area where I found cigarette buts around the food in a dingy hut. The owner assured us this was not normal and would be cleaned and comped some of our meal. I returned and found the same atmosphere weeks later with no changes made. Very, very unpleasing."}, {"review_id": "x8VvMC0dxtfW7AT8DPaNvQ", "user_id": "amTzgPxA28Ey3t_Gmkie_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I'll just say, this is what BBQ is supposed to be.

It must stay in business on liquor sales and the patio. Pulled pork was very dry and not very tasty. Sausage barbecue was average at best. Regular and spicy barbeque sauce both tasted the same. Only good thing was the fried pickles which uses the same batter that the fries and onion rings have which is a carryover from when it was B&B I have eaten BBQ all over the country and this place is easily in the top 10 worst BBQ places I have ever eaten I would give it one star except for the service which very timely and spot-on.  Only complaint was no one ever asked me \"how was your meal\" or \"was everything okay\" which I would definitely would have told him that it was not."}, {"review_id": "GxpStQZ8pn3s35F_H4rQWA", "user_id": "PVzY-cx3pZritq5C6Jutaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "I'm pretty picky about my BBQ.

They weren't good. Too much breading, a bit greasy/soggy. Then our main plates arrived. We got brisket and pulled pork. Both were very dry. We had to soak with BBQ sauce to eat. The machine and cheese was the best side with the others feeling like they just opened a can and tossed in the microwave."}, {"review_id": "9--LtR4qDzk6SB6pjOuwzg", "user_id": "Dh8jcfxa8mP1v_70AfyiZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/4/2017", "text": "Coolest restaurant!!

The rib was so tender it fell from the bone, the potato salad was one of the best I've had and the beans and French fries were tasty as well. I had the plate meal with 3 sides a rib and beef brisket I think it was and pulled pork. All the items in my meal were amazing and my friends food looked just as amazing. The home made cookies were one of the best I've ever had and I tried the chocolate chip cookie. My only complaint was to order your food you use a phone at your table and though I like the concept it was also confusing for a new customer and it was more of a inconvenience considering we had 3 separate orders and it just seemed complicated at that point. I also like seeing my waiter or waitress and having some personal connection but as far as food and service it's a 5 Star I would just reconsider the phone order nonsense but that's my only criticism. Keep it up penguin Ed's!"}, {"review_id": "tiTAD_5-QfGbgJ0PG71gGA", "user_id": "J_C57bI431rcOvnSf27xoQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "Good food good atmosphere.  Kind of feel like a little piece of Memphis in Fayetteville.  Ditch the little bowls though.  Just put my food on a plate.  I hate having to fight to get them out of this dinky bowls.  Wish I could call out employees as there were all great but no name tags.  The one I'm assuming is The manager needs a lesson in people handling.  Corrections should be done in private but I'm thinking she doesn't know that."}, {"review_id": "G7-mM02yoYXloq3bd0_-nA", "user_id": "6_My9EU-SCSr_OLwVCeO2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "One of the best black bean burgers I've had in NWA.

We're from KC, so we are well acquainted with good BBQ. I truly believe that if Penguin Ed's were to open up in KC, they would fare very well. The brisket was melt in your mouth tender, the smoked chicken was to die for, smoked sausage was sliced thin and smoked to perfection, and all the sides we tried paired well. (Gotta love that fried okra) As fantastic as the BBQ was, the scene stealer were their homemade fried PIES. Freshly fried while you waited - crispy perfection on the outside, decadent filling on the inside. And a quick note about staff and service: servers and waitresses were quick with refills and attentive, restaurant was clean and had the nice, laid back atmosphere of all of my favorite BBQ joints. If we're ever in the area again, we will definitely revisit Penguin Ed's."}, {"review_id": "_f_HJwOkKqQVfZCwiYkMPg", "user_id": "c6QCSGfVmLlrqhXGLy7hHQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "We had a very good lunch here.  We started out with a half order of fried dill pickles and they were outstanding!!  Hand battered (not cornmeal like most places do.) They were fried golden brown, with some of them stuck together in glorious nummy clumps. Imagine savory pickle funnel cakes dipped in ranch dressing. I would go back just for the pickles.My husband's pulled pork was tender and juicy and ordered \"Memphis style\". My polish sausage sandwich was fine. Nothing to write home about, but not bad.His potato salad was very good--he said not the best he's ever had, but good. The bite I stole tasted homemade. The BBQ baked beans were also good--better than the brown beans I ordered, which were a bit bland. The biggest disappointment was the fried okra. After the dill pickles, I was really looking forward to seeing what they did with the okra!  But alas, they were those little frozen okra things that you get at cafeterias all over the South. Boo.One thing about the sauces.  My husband ordered his pulled pork mild and I ordered my Polish medium spicy. I'm not a spicy freak (why I ordered it medium, not hot), but that is the mildest \"medium\" heat I have ever had. The server said the clear bottle is mild and the red bottle is the spicy. I used the red bottle sparingly, but there was no need for caution. So don't worry about getting too much heat. The service was as outstanding as the pickles. They were almost to the point of overdoing it, but they were all so sweet and I'd rather have too much attention than not enough."}, {"review_id": "cG_EymWayQvoeZpBlNODpA", "user_id": "kQDYD9bFbvANpAAkeZDZ1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "Wonderful food and very cool atmosphere!
