While there are many places to try, Flying M is my absolute favorite. Having the location inside an old mechanic garage makes this place really stand out. There is plenty of parking nearby if you can't find a space in the lot. The second you walk inside you are greeted with the smell of fresh roasted coffee. The space is huge! The main seating area is right as you walk in but there is also another huge area with a balcony, allowing a lot of people to sit comfortably.The quality of the coffee here is amazing. With a wide variety of options to have your coffee made, everyone should find something that they like. I recommend the Mocha, Breve, and Americano. The menu seems to change a little depending on the season, allowing you to try something new quite often. They also brew tea here and it is equally as good as the coffee. You can buy tea by the cup or get a whole pot for yourself. The house made chai is one of the best I've ever had.There is a large variety of baked goods as well. Giant cinnamon rolls, different kinds of sweet breads, and huge cookies are just a few things that they offer. They also sell cold soaked oats here, which is a nice alternative to hot oatmeal. The baked goods also seem to change depending on the season, but they are all delicious.If you're looking for a great place to hang out with family or friends and have good cup of coffee, Flying M is the place to go!"}, {"review_id": "G0lxGJ3byXBjuRdat0nWwg", "user_id": "Y-fPeP9dmciMYg83esNSWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "My favorite of the two Flying M locations in the Treasure Valley. The downtown location has a somewhat chaotic feel to it (the gift shop/seating space are all sort of meshed together), in my opinion, while the Nampa location provides the relaxing space you look for in a coffee shop. The Vibes:This shop has fun and edgy details throughout, like the eccentric wallpaper in the restrooms. While at the same time it offers a lot of natural light in the daytime with its massive storefront windows...and I am a sucker for natural light! Pop in on a weeknight and you're likely to find it filled with students from Nampa's NNU campus. If you stop in on a weekend night, expect to find a crowd in the back area of the shop surrounding a stage with a local musician playing. I've gone to a few of these shows (for a cheap price of about $5 each time) and have enjoyed myself tremendously. These local concerts are the kind of thing I envisioned as a little girl when my mom would talk about going to poetry slams or local shows at the coffee shop down the street as a young twenty-somethin'. The Coffee:Drinks at both this location and the downtown one are solid. I typically order a drip coffee from here, and the roast is perfect--not too dark, but not weak either. I've also had their mocha before and that was good. However, I recommend asking for 1/2 or 3/4 the normal amount of chocolate so you can get a better taste of the coffee...but that's just my preference. :)"}, {"review_id": "xE8tgoScgmIZ95yxY791Cg", "user_id": "nnBV58x6KJWmli_zQR46iw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Yummy coffee and great atmosphere.  Happy to have the Flying M in Nampa.  Can't wait to go back."}, {"review_id": "YmJSkemSaQjeWjXuUES9NQ", "user_id": "wsG-t03VwskJ1sfQw4Jrjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Always good, huge gathering area to lounge while drinking your beverage of choice.

The Flying M is THEE place to be. My wife and I visit this coffeeshop in Nampa regularly not just because of its delicious coffee, laid back culture, and friendly customer service but also because there is PLENTY of seating options for all types of people. If you want a quiet spot to study, you can always go upstairs. If you enjoy a nice distraction every now & then while potentially running into someone you know, the front space is perfect for you. I feel like the Flying M is suitable for any situation, whether it's meeting a potential employer for an interview or laying low with your significant other on a Saturday night, Flying M is the spot. Happy Hour is from 4-5pm and they now serve beer. Don't believe me, come check it out!"}, {"review_id": "WwX9shvJAuPS6tGpLKwKSA", "user_id": "-gC_-Vf7IaT6uqmQzF-99A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Sister to the Boise location, this Nampa spot earns the popularity of the original.

Favorite drink is their Carmel Latte Smoothie, which is like a frappucino, with perfect creamy texture. Favorite baked treat is their Almond Croissant. It is TO DIE FOR. Reminds me of the French Galette des Rois, the traditional Three Kings Day pastry pie. There is a TON of seating. Possibly due the walls of windows, which makes it really bright, it's a little chilly for me personally, so I always wear layers. The gift shop is full of delightful and unique coloring books, playing cards, journals, and other trinkets. There is a lot of great local art and their merch is super artsy and wonderful."}, {"review_id": "tn4E9IN0ewrQE12NLEbdFw", "user_id": "LiWm3gaXfDtGVaknNjk-cA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I do not claim to be a \"regular\" here.

Previously, I gave 'em four stars but this is a FIVE STAR business if there ever was one ... friendly staff ... lots of seating ... a gift shop ... and very good items on the menu.I ordered my \"usual\" ... a 16 ounce latte, with an extra shot, which was served in a nice ceramic cup. The barista created a work of art ... I almost didn't want to spoil the foam-art.The latte was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S !!! I also ordered a snickerdoodle, which was very tasty and, perhaps, a teensy-bit over-priced at $1.70 ...This is simply a great place and I gotta get here more often than I do."}, {"review_id": "TiT5fFDYlZ-j-Ezxi4Poig", "user_id": "WzOsH43RUOmkB4me8eBEcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "Favorite coffee shop in Nampa!!

Just a personal preference. They have some snacks available but not so much for meals.  They do carry Croissants, pastries, cookies and the like. They no longer are a music venue, and there are no more free refills. They used to display local artists but not anymore. There is an interesting if pricey gift store. Many of the things that attracted me to this place( music, art) have gone by the wayside. The nearly 2 dollars I was asked to pay for a previously free refill really turned me off last time. If I'm going to have a ham and cheese croissant and a cup of coffee I don't expect to pay for a refill. It's still a neat venue for a coffee shop, but less of a destination and more of a get your coffee and get out place now."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/flying-m-coffee-garage-nampa?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
