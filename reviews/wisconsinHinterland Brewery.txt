All the sausage was fantastic and the pretzel was the perfect balance of chewy and crunchy. My date ordered the Blackened Barramundi.  That might be the most delicious fish I have ever eaten.   I wish I had ordered it.  Drinks- We ordered simple drinks but they were made perfectly Service- The service was some of the best service I have received.  Our drinks were always filled.  We were checked on enough that it wasn't annoying but also not too long.  Any special requests we made were handled quickly. If you want a place to go for a special date night, this place should be at or near the top of your list.  The atmosphere is fantastic.  It is a little more pricey than your typical restaurant but the food and service you receive is worth it."}, {"review_id": "bKUpZfgXrpgjdQ19r9XgSA", "user_id": "utaM2d1eLWuHD8Tgd4HYuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Service was slow, but great atmosphere.  Good food but a little priced, you're paying for the atmosphere literally across from Green Bay Packers Lambeau Field."}, {"review_id": "VJYSrNqH9wqq3Y3-4Ey_Rw", "user_id": "_68U0qQFLqBdjAAPgz3VuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/23/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My wife and I decided to visit the new Hinterland in the Titletown Entertainment District ... we were glad we did.  We were pleasantly surprised!  We decided to stop for a drink (no food).  Their tap beer list obviously features their own beers as well as a healthy variety of guest taps. We found the prices to be very reasonable.The decor brings you immediately into a lodge-like atmosphere with taxidermy mounts, log trim and two fireplaces.  The seating is arranged like a beer hall with ample seating right at the bar which enables you to look right into the kitchen as your food is prepared. A nice touch!  The second floor provides you with the place where you could have your own private party with equal views of Lambeau Field.On this winter night we were able to watch the Christmas laser show projected off of the face of Lambeau Field -- great location!  As others have noted, it can get a little noisy at times but what do you expect ... it's a beer hall not a church!  In our opinion the new version of Hinterland was long overdue.

I personally think the beers here are pretty horrible and have had issues with beer quality in the past.  I had the Maple Bock which was pretty lackluster in the flavor profile and I also had the barrel aged barleywine which I had to send back because it had an apple flavor profile that shouldn't be in that beer based on the description.We got here during dinner time on a Friday evening. There was no wait for a table so we were seated pretty quickly.  The waitress was pleasant and friendly when we saw her. We ordered drinks first and then we ordered our appetizers. A few minutes later we ordered our dinner.  The apps came out and looked amazing but what was REALLY disappointing was that 1 minute later our dinner came out.  We felt rushed to eat our appetizers because we didn't want our dinner to get cold.The food quality for me was really tasty!!  I enjoyed everything we ate... from the shrimp and pork belly appetizer to the pork steak I got. On a side note... read the menu carefully. I ordered the Porterhouse thinking it was the steak but the menu clearly stated WOOD FIRE GRILLED PORK PORTERHOUSE. So definitely my bad but a word of caution for those who don't read everything :)Would we come back here? Potentially. Pricing is pretty high here but damn the food was tasty. Not being someone who gets to Green Bay fairly often I can imagine there are other restaurants with similar quality but not priced as aggressively.  The building and surrounding area is pretty awesome. Worth a visit at least once."}, {"review_id": "K-cHOUuEtcTskC0mHGUdBw", "user_id": "9fjGRNPTtsJyxtFC_O0x8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/3/2017", "text": "Green Bay - you da bomb with the brewery game. Hinterland has the most GORG spot right next to the stadium, with an 2 bars and multiple dining areas (inside, outside and upstairs). We went to pregame before the Packers vs Bengals game but always wanted some food before we went into the stadium too. We were placed inside, next to the main downstairs bar in front of the open doors that led outside where there was a band playing. Literally the most perfect pregame setup for us, plus we had plenty of televisions surrounding us to watch the games before ours. There menu on game days is smaller, as to be expected, so there was a lot of shareable plates. Which was perfect for what we were wanting and I can't wait to tell you about what we got to eat! The Green Bay \"BBQ\" platter was something the server hadn't seen yet since it was a new addition and let's just say he was recommending it to the other patrons after seeing this masterpiece. It was a shareable plate of country style pork ribs and sauerkraut, smoked pastrami, smoked pork belly, German potato salad, eye rolls and beer mustard. The pork belly was the ULTIMATE stand out and after both our food experiences in Green Bay so far, apparently they know how to do their pork belly. Cause it's easily the best I've ever had.The German potato salad was a unique flavor to this plate and was a great addition. The pulled pork was tender and tasty. The pastrami was fall apart mouth-watering. The perfect pairing to our brews. Oh and looking for a easy to drink brew for Packerland? Grab their Packland Pilsner! It pays homage to thei team and it's easy to put back. Definitely take a peek at this spot if your in Green Bay! We will be back I'm sure."}, {"review_id": "wQuKIviDf0C1oHn38TP9Og", "user_id": "ih7khYWny8OyZLxQFeqnGg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "If you're turned on by being across the street from Lambeau, this may be a good place for you.

Location is super convenient, parking is easy (on non-game days), and the food and service were both very good.There is also a lot to do around Hinterland, including a kids play park as well as a winter snow sledding ramp because, you know, it's cold in Wisconsin. Overall, this is a pretty good place to go for good food. It's a little more expensive than some of the other Packers pre-game spots, but the experience is totally worth the extra cheddar (cheese joke for the win!)."}, {"review_id": "m0CpZu7VDz6-pcC9qY5Flg", "user_id": "q3ixAMFAH2KnAwCLXGxhlQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "Meh. Space is cool, love the antlers and the weird deer sorta floating in the corner. The collection of mounts by the bar is cool. Lay out on the ground floor is a mix of large tables and a row of bench tables. The bar section is sweet, big televisions and great stools. It is LOUD! No seriously, do not go here if you have a hard of hearing friend. Do not go here if you are looking to have an intimate date. It's super dinny and conversation was mute. Loud drinkers watching the game are going to dominate the sound. Bar service was fine. Nothing overly awesome, but I was able to try a few tasters before choosing a decent Pale Ale. Table service was not good. Maybe our server was new, maybe having a bad day. Maybe she just isn't any good. I think the latter. Food was good. Pass on the meat and cheese plate. It's just alright, definitely nothing to repeat. The fried cheese curds both goat and cheddar were good. The sauce was weird. The special was fried Perch - it was great. I split a burger, and the kitchen actually plated and gave each of us fries which was a nice touch (no extra cost) the burger looked amazing but it was just alright. Won't be ordering again. I really wanted the ribeye but it's not served downstairs. The nachos looked pretty damn yummy, maybe next time. Overall, I don't think I will go out of my way to dine here again.

After 20 years of being located downtown, Hinterland's new home is in the shadow of Lambeau Field in the new Titletown District.I've heard a lot of people say the new layout of Hinterland is not what they expected, but going in without appearance expectations, I really liked the new space. The ambiance is chic lodge / chic man cave. Huge wood burning fireplaces bookend the downstairs dining room, mounted moose and elk (I think?), as well. Stylish wood and leather furniture and animal hide rugs near the fireplace. The outside of the building is very industrial / metal heavy, the inside is not much warmer. The acoustics are a challenge, it is very loud because of how little cloth there is. There are easy ways to resolve that without sacrificing style though, like adding foam padding under chairs.There is no view of Lambeau Field from the restaurant area (we didn't go upstairs), but there is an outdoor area (complete with garage doors for that indoor/outdoor feeling) that will likely be wildly popular on game weekends.We enjoyed a quick bite of two pizzas and a few beers. I had the Blackberry Berliner sour, which I loved! The pizzas were phenomenal - great thought was put into the toppings (I had pesto, artichoke, roasted red pepper and my boyfriend had prosciutto and pepperoni) and the wood fired crust was perfectly done. Service was a bit scatterbrained. We are at the bar in part because we were strapped for time and also because I loved the window into the working kitchen - a cool feature! There was a major disconnect between who was helping us and it took a long time to get drinks or food ordered. It's fine though, honestly, that would have been resolved by sitting at a table. We noticed that some tables are family style, where you may end up sharing a table with other groups. This is not common in Green Bay, so I'm interested to see how it is received! I enjoyed our brief experience a great deal and plan to come back for a full dining experience again! Great job on the new building, Hinterland!"}, {"review_id": "mmO2f1ewgKhKvNaNF1rtyg", "user_id": "iXDNrZNhPuiO0CWXX6x8ZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/14/2017", "text": "I had only been to the old location one a long time ago, but when I was in town I wanted to check out the new digs near Lambeau.  It did not disappoint!They have a great selection of brews, from their usuals to seasonal, guest, special offerings, etc.  I settled on the Blackerbrry Berliner Weisse, and it was very good (it's advertised as a sour beer, and that holds true!  The food menu, while not extensive, did have some unique offerings.  The Cherry Wheat BBQ Pulled Pork was great!  The portion was great for me (a smaller eater), but I could see that for someone with a larger appetite it might not be enough.We order dessert to go-the Pretzel Bread Pudding was good, but nothing amazing.  The server was friendly and attentive, and was patient when we needed extra time to digest the menu.The one downside (and it's a fairly big one) is the noise.  We came early on a Saturday so it wasn't busy, but it got busy as we sat there.  Because it's an industrial style decor everything echoes and gets very loud-I'd hate to be there when the place was full because at half/three-quarters full we had to shout to be heard across a table of 3.  Also, we sat by the garage doors and the sun beating in got very warm, though I'm not sure how they'd handle it.I will definitely go back the next time I'm in town, I just would aim to go during an off-peak time when it's less noisy and I can enjoy more."}, {"review_id": "mXYuaeqFwNRF-oOzUXTeVg", "user_id": "33t6SbYrgbaHQKOc3H6Qfg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "Great place to do a brewery tour!!!  This is so cool .  This place will be packed come football season!!  (No Pun intended)!!  I would recommend making the trek up!!"}, {"review_id": "BsrZg4J_X-8hx_h9EF_ivA", "user_id": "oViqEqzfvZgvNZqNrvSK-g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "9/24/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I waited a few days to put this review in, because I wanted to make sure that I had a better prospective on our experience this past Friday night when we had reservations in High Gravity for our anniversary dinner.  My initial thoughts stand - other than stellar customer service from our wait staff who did their absolute best in a horrible situation, the entire experience was terrible from start to finish.  However, I want to make it clear that our wait staff was amazing - friendly, courteous, and did their absolute best to make a bad situation better! As someone who is in a service industry and understands how it it to deal with customers on a daily basis, they went above and beyond.  Truly outstanding service.The evening started off on a bad note as we wanted an intimate evening out, and the ambience was loud and rambunctious; which is great for a pub or beer hall, but not so great to a place that is trying to advertise itself as a high end dining establishment.  It was so bad we practically had to shout at each other, and our server, to make ourselves heard.  There was a loud group up there that should have been moved to a more appropriate place, where they could have continued having a fun night out without ruining all of the other diners experiences (we did see a few other couples walk out).  This was an abject failure on their managements part.  A bunch for sound absorption panels would go a long way to helping this issue.Our first course, the sweet potato and apple soup was very tasty; however, it was obviously sitting under a heat lamp for too long as it had a very unappealing skim on top and the \"toast\" served with it was very dry.  It did have a very good flavor though.Our next course, salad, was great.  Nicely crunchy, bitter, greens served with a wonderful vinegarette.  It is saying something when the salad is the only thing that came out of the kitchen perfect.My entree is where it all fell apart for good.  I had ordered then $46 ribeye, and what they served me wasn't worth anywhere near that price!  It was over cooked, bland and had a strange sweetness to it, that along with the deep fried taste, was just terrible. The roasted sweet potatoes were extremely over cooked (just mush with you skins), and the mushrooms more resembled potato chips than they did wonderfully sauted mushrooms.  The kicker was the deep fried kale on top of the steak, as there were  large leaves of deep fried kale, that were not drained or blotted on top of the steak before serving, so they tasted like fry oil only.  I'm not sure how this dish even leaves the kitchen, let alone trying to pass this off for $46.  My wife's scallops were well prepared with a nice color to them, but the risotto had obviously been sitting for a while as it had separated and the mushrooms were, again, more like chips (or improperly reconstituted dried mushrooms) than anything else.  And 3 scallops for $38 is not a good value for the quality received.  We have had scallops in 2 star michellin restaurants cost much less and get more than what this dish presented.  You do not have to search far in Green Bay, or the Fox Valley, to get a better scallop dish at a better value.We came into High Gravity with high expectations as it was billed as a fine dining experience, and we left with nothing but disappointment.  The service was fantastic, and I can't say enough about how appreciative we were, but I don't know that we will come back for the food.  The beer we will come back for, but not so much the food.  What is really disappointing is that, for High Gravity, they charge really high prices without following up with the appropriate level of food quality.  If you are going to charge the same, or more (!), than Sandfords, Ardent, c1880, or Hinterland (!) in Milwaukee or others in Green Bay you have to be able to back  up the experience - from the ambience to the food and they failed on both of those levels.  Everyone has a bad night, but a properly managed establishment will overcome those times and make sure the customer leaves with a smile on their face and an anticipation for coming back, neither of which we had.I'm going to leave this review in a positive note.  As I've mentioned, the service was fantastic.  Our wait staff went out of their way to make us happy, and to try to rectify the issue we had with our dinner.  They even went as far as supplying us with a gift card on the way out.  I can't speak enough on how wonderful they were (Shannon!) in a very tough circumstance - they went above and beyond, and were the one bright spot in our experience."}, {"review_id": "qfpnfk4HUBP_048j4RRY4g", "user_id": "WV5XKbgVHJXEgw7f-b6PVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The last review was for the old location this is for the new location.

We liked it so much we asked the bartender about it. The charcuterie board was okay nothing overly exciting on it. The meats and cheeses were of decent quality. The location is spacious and the bar was large and it was easy for all 5 of us to pull up and settle in. You can now watch the kitchen staff work which I found interesting.

The service was absolutely atrocious! It was a Wednesday evening, so it was not overly busy. We were seated right away and then waited at least 15 minutes while the waitress in our section made eye contact at least 4 times and then completely ignored us. I finally went back to the host station to ask about service and the hostess somewhat apologized and said she would find our waitress. I then observed her joking around with the other hostess before finally going to find our waitress. It was another 5 minutes before the waitress came over to get our drink orders. I ended up ordering a hamburger, expecting a hand pressed, thick burger and was very disappointed by the $16 burger that was obviously a frozen patty. For that amount of money for a hamburger, it should be amazing. I will say that the garlic fries were very good and my husband said his pizza was delicious.  The waitress was less than attentive and took another 10 minutes to box up my husband's pizza. For the prices and hype, this was an extremely disappointing experience.  It took an extra half hour+ just waiting for our waitress.
