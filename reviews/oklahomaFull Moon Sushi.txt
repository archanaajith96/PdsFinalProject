Nestled in downtown Norman, we were able to find parking on the street and made our way to the door.There weren't a lot of people, but it was also a little later than dinner time. I think there was a game on, so, yes they have TVs and the Thunder was probably playing. The server was great, I wish I could remember her name. She helped us with some sushi recommendations and we ended up getting 4 rolls. Only one was fishy tasting and so my friend didn't like it, but the rest were great.I really liked the ambiance and the cool bar feel. I would go back again."}, {"review_id": "TBelVgu__OUOeBz0qywd6g", "user_id": "VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Full Moon Sushi happened to be catering at a work-related conference I was attending.  They had several platters of pre-made rolls and nigiri all ready along with a mini sushi bar set up.  After days of enjoying Tex-Mex, lots of juicy brisket (BBQ and German-style with mustard), I was relieved to see sushi in Oklahoma!I was skeptical at first. Oklahoma is a land-locked state although they do have lakes for bass and catfish.  No idea where they get their fish, but the nigiri is actually pretty fresh and tasty.  Rice was seasoned with vinegar and loosely packed the way I like it.The nice surprise is their special Psycha D roll.  I saw the sushi chef make one for the bartender so I requested one as well.  It looked like a California Roll but turned out to have asparagus, tuna, cucumber on the inside and cashew, green onion, and sriracha on the outside.  Good amount of crunch and spice.  It had some lime creme fraiche to help neutralize some of the heat but I wound up washing it down with a can of Sapporo."}, {"review_id": "jqrOpycS1nu7oX3wHD2K_w", "user_id": "ts3PXAL80WgUNlsVGOkR4Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "So I'm writing this review in confusion. I'm confused with how this place has 4.5 stars and how there's a cult following.To start with a positive the service here is fantastic and the crab cakes are some of the best that I've ever had. The place has a cool hipster vibe that may be better suited for a different cuisine but that's neither here nor there.The sushi however, is some of the worst I've ever had. It was so fishy which tells me that it's either not fresh or a bad cut. Their rolls would say they'd include certain ingredients and there would literally just be a speck of whatever it is in there. The roll options just seemed like different variations of the same thing. Almost every rolls has spicy mayo or cream cheese. Which I love cream cheese but I'm sure there's people who don't. Bottom line come here for the free edamame, some drinks, and an appetizer or two. Skip the sushi which is the main attraction. I personally don't recommend but hey you might like fishy sushi like everyone else in Norman."}, {"review_id": "nQQ6cFmfQZzfnWcNA9Ccgg", "user_id": "ljVCilZb4ZJWo1m6r2tA4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Habenero heaven was super spicy just like I like it,  gyoza was savory chicken.

Not much variety when it comes to the types of fish or sushi rolls they offer and they are pretty expensive for what you're getting. Honestly, a lot of them seemed similar, you really have about 4 different flavors to choose from because they are so similar. Service was good, the place was clean, staff were very friendly and it looked like local art work on the walls being supported which is great! The food was decent, not terrible at all and it's nice that they offer to fry all of the rolls for a small extra fee. We tried the Tokyo, Shrimpalicious, and Tsunami. All were good and well plated but I did not feel like it was worth the price. I did appreciate the edamame though, thanks for that! I would suggest either lowering the price a bit or increasing the size of the rolls to match the prices."}, {"review_id": "8a10XO7r3t5g4wISJl8JpQ", "user_id": "-gY0O1J2Y91mdftZUhwXjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Fave Sushi place in Norman .. great happy hour specials!  Super helpful staff and welcoming.  Clean and just trendy enough"}, {"review_id": "etfv1yS3calP9fRDV-48ug", "user_id": "I_6or9vQiL9qoSz5PuW4fg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2017", "text": "Somehow, some way, sushi in Norman Oklahoma is possible and Actually good. My one reservation is that they seem to love jalapeño, whoever the chef is puts it in so many rolls, and I am spice sensitive to the maximum. This is obviously all about preference, but of course you can also request to not have the jalapeño in the roll and your mouth tingles will not be a problem!We had the spicy tuna, a staple roll that I try at every sushi place, they spice it with a dab of siracha on top, not my favorite thing, but once again, if you like spice then you do you! We also had the rainbow, sesame salmon, and the special that night which unfortunately I cannot remember the name of. It was drizzled with the spicy mayo though, and if I can handle a spice then it will be a spice mixed with mayonnaise, because mayonnaise. Rainbow roll was the overall crowd pleaser between the two of us! And there you have it! The service was excellent, the food delicious, and the overall vibe very casual! Check it out!"}, {"review_id": "5NMHTSuVa81zMh-_pg-hgw", "user_id": "wCrgN9nFGFMbF362DciaVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "We had an early lunch and the waitress' attitude was repulsive. I would've taken aloof cluelessness over her brooding passive aggressive hatred for my face. I highly recommend eating here because the sushi is so amazing that I will come back and so amazing that I gave it 4 stars and even gave her a 10% tip even though 65% of me wanted to leave nothing. The sushi is hands down the best I've had--take into consideration I've only ever lived in landlocked states, but these rolls held up against the likes of the OKC metro and Santa Fe, NM (a culinary dreamland).

Best in Norman. Not only do they have generous sized portions of nigiri and sashimi, but their fish is always fresh. Come on a Wednesday and you're likely to get an assortment of Hawaiian fish fresh flown in. They also have a large menu with rolls to please everyone, from the Okie who likes cream cheese in their roll (not me!) to the heat lover (anything with the cherry death sauce or the habanero-mango sauce). My favorite rolls: Hamachi Verde, Psycha-D, Snake Pliskin and the Rainbow Roll (especially with fresh Hawaiian fish when available).Service is always friendly and fast.

This place turned me into a sushi fan! :-o  I've always liked nigiri, and their salmon nigiri is really fresh and plentiful.  With $2 salmon nigiri for their happy hour between 3 and 6pm every day, I got hooked.  I learned you can get rolls made with something other than seaweed (soy paper, +$1/roll), so I started trying different rolls here and there.  Soy paper changes sushi for me.  It got rid of the texture and taste that kept me from enjoying rolls.Well, crap... I just got a new expensive hobby.  I'm now a full blown sushi fan who can't get enough, dreams about the lion roll in my sleep, and craves it on the regular (2am, 9am, 3pm, 6pm... it's always time for sushi, right!?).  Seriously, what did they do to me?  I can't get enough.  Hubby is happy as he now has a new partner in crime to rack up a giant bill for dinner.Now that I've explored their sushi rolls more, I'm upping my rating to 5.  They have some really awesome creations, with yummy sauces that are fantastic. Like little parties in my mouth!  Their chefs are super flexible and make substitutions and omissions as requested.  I've been many times now, and I've never had off-tasting fish.  It's always super fresh, every single time I've gone.  If you are like me and get soy paper, be patient, as it takes longer because it's harder to work with.My previous review on the non-sushi items, atmosphere, and staff still stand.  But because the sushi is so fantastic, the somewhat uncomfortable atmosphere is cast to the side.  I don't care anymore.  I just want my sushi!"}, {"review_id": "W1Hf0Lyt5p_B__Aqk7UcwA", "user_id": "XZ93a0IHuM-1_YtI_SR73w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/3/2015", "text": "From word of mouth I've heard really great things about Full Moon Sushi, and they were right for the most part. I had their calamari appetizer which was a great start to my meal (I loved everything about it - the texture, the sauce it came with, good size). From reading other reviews I decided to try the meek monster, which did not disappoint. I would probably get this almost every time. I also had the squidbilly which was decent but nothing too special. Definitely look out for their happy hour specials! I'm not a fan of the sushi they offer at the time but I love their gyoza, which is even better when it's half-priced!The staff was very attentive and provided great service, something I haven't seen a lot of in Norman lately. The ambiance is a little different from your typical sushi restaurant, but overall casual and not bad. Full Moon is not my absolute favorite sushi place, but it's probably the best sushi bar in Norman, so you'll definitely find me there from time to time."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/full-moon-sushi-norman?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
