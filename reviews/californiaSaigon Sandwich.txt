Saigon Sandwich and L&G Vietnamese Sandwich are two that are literally across from each other.I decided to try Saigon Sandwich first as it had a 4.5 star rating with almost 3000 reviews. It is small shop that generally has a line out of the door. The good news is that it moves pretty fast. The menu is pretty limited with I think 6 different types of Banh-mi which includes steam pork, roast port, pork pate, roast chicken and the combination. Prices of most of the sandwiches are $4 with tax.I generally get a couple of roast chickens which are enough for a full meal. The sandwiches are solid. The only complaint will be that the French roll is a little to crispy, but I like it. Not much else to say expect that Saigon Sandwich stands head and shoulder over all the other Banh-Mi restaurants in the hood. Generous 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 is how I'd rate this place."}, {"review_id": "0hGV0wF8ygfu9ICHkRidtg", "user_id": "BQmYrlTD5uUu8OHnFEw3Ew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Tasty AND cheap sammiches stuffed with a bunch of veggies and your choice of meat. This hole in the wall is ran by two ladies who are fast multitaskers! I got the fanci pork sandwich with their dessert drink and it came to a total of $7 :DMy sandwich had a nice crunchiness to it and the veggies were fresh with a hint of sweetness. I also loved their mayo based sauce which I believe ties all the flavors together. This tiny shop has two seats inside. I managed to grab one and devour my sandwich while I stared at people with a stuffed mouth. Will be back again to try the other meats!"}, {"review_id": "ud3Q9RnNLC9BO0XBzMS8uA", "user_id": "oVAJfFVaAdWSq7kJqR0Ckw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Best banh mi in all of sf! Super cheap and made to order. A sandwich there will cost you 4 bucks and some chump change. Their pate is bomb and I love that they load up their sandwiches with it. What makes their banh mi bomb is their uniquely dense French bread. Their bread is different that other banh mis I've had before. Almost like a cross between a croissant and French baguette. It's perfect. They load each loaf with loads of meat and toast your sandwich minutes before serving. They also don't skimp on the amount of pickled veggies either. This place is winner in my book. Always worth digging into my couch to find enough change to get me a combo banh mi at Saigon Sandwich!"}, {"review_id": "uskQ09dVF1My0TX-nIhxYA", "user_id": "rrfHL-1xvGM3kDaXsNDkQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Hands down the best banh mi I've ever had. Although the prices have climbed up a bit ($4.75 for the combo sandwich), this place is still incredibly affordable compared to other Vietnamese sandwich places (~$7 per sandwich). Definitely a hole in the wall kind of place but don't be mistaken, this place is the place to go! The sandwiches are STUFFED with meat and veggies, these ladies do not skimp. The pate is out of this world and the signature sauce that they drizzle on each sandwich is basically liquid gold. Packed with flavor and super satisfying. They also have a veggie option with tofu!"}, {"review_id": "CuQVO4_OQfDSWPxcXHRxxw", "user_id": "ETzbhhLnpSqBYfZtXc8mWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "//LocationIf you can get over the fact that this place is in the tenderloin it's a must visit! Also, during lunchtime or the day the area is bustling with people, so the location shouldn't deter you from this awesome spot! //FoodThis sandwich was amazing, the bread was a little tough for being soft roll but the ingredients in this sandwich come together really well and some people prefer tougher breads. I got the pate and for people who are wondering what that is, it's similar to ground beef but mushier. Personally I tried it because it seemed unique but I'd probably go with a different meat since I didn't enjoy the consistency of the pate that much.//Price-Service Often people get worried when they see a long line, but we came here at 12:30 on a Friday (peak lunchtime) and only had to wait fifteen minutes considering there was about 8 people in front of us waiting. The women making the sandwich and taking the order are quick and efficient as they seem to have been doing this for a long time. The real steal of this place is the fact that it's $4 dollars for their regular sandwiches and 4.50 for their combo, which has different meats in it. In SF price is always an issue but this spot is affordable and tasty, so I'll definitely be here again."}, {"review_id": "R8EJ-X9PY_upxYOPv_SPvQ", "user_id": "KlbSsB2F6VH5AwY9HL8ovA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Wow, this might be simultaneously the cheapest and also the best banh mi I've had in my life. At $4.00 for a roast pork banh mi, it doesn't get cheaper than this. While everything was good, I think the sauce is what made the banh mi truly stand out. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the special combination banh mi.It's important to note that this place is cash-only.

That day I also saw that they had a sign up declaring their food safety rating was in the 70s, which fell under the category of \"needs improvement.\" At first, I thought maybe it could be something I ate from the day before, but shortly after I showed symptoms so did my boyfriend.

I've been going there for sandwiches ever since the store opened. The staff used to be friendly. Today I went there and ordered a fancy pork sandwich. The long was so long and I waited 30 minutes for my sandwich. The Vietnamese lady who took the order was so darn rude. I was very disappointed with my sandwich. As I always finish eating the second half of the sandwich, I found a piece of thing in my sandwich. It looks like a piece of hair right on the fancy pork. So disgusting. I almost vomit. I would never go back to that place ever again. Such a disgusting place!!!!  I had a stomach ache after eating that gross sandwich.

It was one of the first places I came to when I visited San Francisco in early 2016. Almost two years later, and it remains one of my favorite locations in the city. The ladies working there have warmed up to me (probably because I used to show up nearly 3 times a week for a few months), and $4.00 for a filling sandwich is a steal- not to mention the taste is better than any other spot I've tried.AMBIANCE is quaint. It's a tiny shop- if you arrive after 10 am, you'll notice a line forming down the street. It's that popular. I learned to arrive between 8 and 9 am, where there is little to no line. There are a couple chairs to sit, but with everyone in line to get food, it's a cramped experience. Walk down Larkin and turn right on Turk to find a few spots to sit and enjoy your meal.FOOD is always amazing. I get the roast pork banh mi, which is delicious. They really stuff the sandwiches with the meat, veggies, and sauce, so you always get the bang for your buck (take notes, Chipotle). There's lots of Vietnamese treats inside- I've tried a few and highly recommend them.RATING is a favorite five. I adore this spot. If you are considering this spot on a list of things to do or try in the city, this should be #1 (make sure you get there early- they open at 7:00 am, so no excuses!)."}, {"review_id": "jQDyuKKj2wWaMgBAjK1FgA", "user_id": "9kldnKWlnNZTh17EFbzESQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Ahhh...No. I do NOT know why people love this place. Other than it's a cheap eat in a damn expensive city. The food here sucks out loud! There's also only two spots to sit. If you miss out you listen to people gloat. I ordered the chicken and it's essentially sliced deli meat on crappy French bread, with waaay too much carrot. The only thing that dresses it up is the sauce. This is the sorriest excuse I've ever seen for a Banh Mi in my existence. If you're cash poor, I can see why people eat here. Otherwise avoid this place. I don't eat pork. I can't speak to the quality of that.

When it comes to this quintessential French inspired sandwich, I personally think that the bread is key. Unfortunately, the baguette from here was too hard and crumbly.

While each sandwich offered a wealth of delicious flavors in each bite, the disappointing quality of the baguette is unforgivable in my book.If you want stellar banh mi, you'll need to drive all the way to east side San Jose...or fly all the way to Vietnam.

If yes, you're going to love Saigon Sandwich. Value: excellent - $4 even, cash only. Size is hefty - I ate two my first time here and it was a bad idea. Taste: top of the line - they're churning out sandwiches so quickly all the ingredients are incredibly fresh. Service: it's okay. Brisk but effective, at Saigon's price taste and value they can pretty much do whatever they want and still have a lengthy wait. So I don't begrudge them this at all! Also the line moves quickly and the place is very shallow, so don't be put off if you see it stretching out the door and down the block. If you're in the Tenderloin and not a vegetarian this is about the best lunch I can recommend. Like all the best restaurants in SF the menu is extremely limited: chicken, pork, fancy pork or combo sandwich options. I think the chicken is best. If you want a side they also have packaged chips (not sure about price) and cups of tapioca desserts ($2). The 3k reviews don't lie. Check it out! (Especially if you happen to be on nearby jury duty. It's easily the best option)"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/saigon-sandwich-san-francisco?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
