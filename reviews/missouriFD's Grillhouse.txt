After checking Yelp, we wisely ordered the Hushpuppies as an appetizer. It is the best $1 appetizer I've ever had. My wife had the Hawaiian Chicken dinner with sweet potato casserole and carrots. She quickly confessed it was some of the best tasting chicken she'd ordered. The sweet potato casserole could be dessert but is scrumptious as a 'vegetable' choice. I picked FD's Combo and chose stuffed shrimp, crawfish etoufee & crab cake. The seafood rivals any Florida fish house or Gulf Shores, Alabama establishment!  Spiced right and fresh ingredients make for a superb combination!!  It was scrumptious and a huge serving with the cole slaw and sweet potato casserole!My mother-in-law opted for a Chicken tenders dinner with loaded baked potato and carrots.  She thoroughly enjoyed about half and took the other half home. Our waitress, Taylor, was extremely efficient and friendly. She apologized they had run out of baked potatoes and asked both my wife and mother-in-law to choose another side item. They both were wise enough to pick sweet potato casserole. But about half way through our meal, Taylor brought each of them a loaded baked potato (as they had just come out of the oven). What a nice gesture and wonderful customer service!!I could go on & on, but trust me when I say it was a 5 Star dining extravaganza!!  We will be back soon for lunch and again for dinner, too."}, {"review_id": "xrSAD37FrOHopQ9BGHhx6g", "user_id": "z46hBZp_xu--bQuOp67w-w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Went on March 22, 2018.Calamari that I ordered was pretty good and so were the fish tacos (as well as the shrimp gumbo), but one of the reasons why I came here was to buy someone a steak. Steak doesn't seem to be their forte, unfortunately. The steak was ordered medium well done, and what was brought out was medium rare at best (i.e. bloody). They must have been understaffed, because it took so long to get the attention of a waitress that by the time we got the steak back we were done and ready to leave. The fact that we could hear another party behind us complain of precisely the same issue (an under-cooked steak) leads me to believe this is not an uncommon problem. Even worse, when we got home we discovered that it was still under-cooked (for the level of doneness that was requested). This is not a bad place. I've visited twice for lunch (although, I didn't order steak on the second visit). I found the experience decent both times. I'm not sure if there are better fish tacos in the area, and the calamari is pretty great. Bummer about the steak though."}, {"review_id": "6l3vEI4XhDXqwwIVMuWiEA", "user_id": "5e90Lt24WCI3fvKIIhjYxg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "FD's Grill House 012618,My Daughter and I ate here tonight out of necessity and time constraints as it was about 1930 and the Texas Roadhouse next door had a 1 hour wait line and we needed to be back at the Holiday in at 2130 for story time. 1 hour wait is no problem; Coach's story time was non-negotiable. 15 minute wait that turned into a 10 minute wait got us seated in a hurry. This is what I had for review* Ice tea no sugar. w/lemon* Starters: Classic Calamari* Entrée: Red Snapper Alexander; buttered corn; southern coleslaw* Desert: Shrimp Gumbo We were seated and made drink orders and were allowed to menu for a bit when our waitress came and took our order. We ordered the Classic Calamari to share and I ordered a cup of Shrimp Gumbo to sample. Calamari arrived with a cup of marinara sauce and a lemon half with a seed bonnet. The bonnet should be used by more restaurants as it eliminates seeds from dropping into your food while you squeeze the lemon juice of it. It also eliminates the accidental squirting of innocent civilians. Calamari was lightly fried and not overcooked, rings only and no tentacles to be found. Marinara was neat.Gumbo arrived in a small cup as ordered. The remarkable part was that there were three large shrimp and sausage pieces in a perfectly colored and flavored roux. After I cleaned out the cup I was wishing it had been a bowl. This was good stuff.My Red Snapper Alexander was served on a 12\" white platter, grilled and nestled on a bed of rice, covered in an Alexander sauce. Alexander sauce is not something I see very often. It  is a thinner version of a white gravy made with butter as a fat, then flour to make a roux and you then add enough clam juice or seafood broth for a desired thickness. There were also four pieces of crawfish and three small shrimp that could have been cooked in the sauce. I couldn't tell from the flavor and the plating looked like it was mishandled from the kitchen to the table. It was kind of homely looking but tasted great. The buttered corn I ordered as my side was placed on the left side of the plate and was sweet and buttery as advertised. My second side was their southern coleslaw. It was good but not remarkable.The restaurant was nice and dare I say upscale, it was very clean and modern. Wait staff was properly attentive and were not overworked as the place was full and there was a good flow throughout. They have a little something for everyone on the menu. It's not too extensive or exotic but does have a lot of fish and shrimp type plates. Worth a go if you can't get into the Roadhouse.I write these reviews to assist you in the food experience and not so much the service experience. If you enjoy my review(s), please click compliment or follow me. God Bless!"}, {"review_id": "MgS8C2WOPKLB6GvsqvU1MA", "user_id": "YlLTErD5Hn2erJ6T1eExCQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "FD's Grillhouse is a very affordable restaurant where you can order burgers, chicken strips, ribs, steak or fish tacos! I love the wide variety their menu offers. The restaurant kinda reminds me of an upscale version of cheddars/Applebee's. We started off with the dip trio appetizer, which comes with bean dip, salsa, and cheese dip, but you can substitute any of these dips out for spinach dip! Our server was very attentive and quick, but we did feel a little rushed when we first sat down."}, {"review_id": "7qc6qPGo2ZaHGLqpg7YXkA", "user_id": "JYNQhQpHZ3CVTZyKfPVouQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "We are from out of town, but visited this place after reading the good reviews. I must say this place is a good quality restaurant that has varied selections for anyone. That being said, I was a little surprised that they only offered 2 soups (clam chowder or gumbo). We were seated right away, but the booth was a little crowded from table to seat (and neither are movable). It's a little noisy in there as well, so be prepared in case you want a quieter establishment. The waitress was very friendly, and brought our drinks in due time. I ordered the firecracker tacos because I saw multiple reviews that they were tasty. I was not disappointed. The tacos arrived fresh, and the firecracker sauce was just right - not hot at all but a mild heat. The fries were seasoned well. Another in our party ordered the Salmon salad. She said it tasted very good, not fishy like some of the farm raised salmon at other restaurants. The salad was a large portion as well. I really liked this place. My fellow Yelpers came thru again by steering me to a good dinner in unfamiliar territory. The prices are very reasonable for what you get. Thanks again Yelp!!!"}, {"review_id": "PhY0ZQXC4fVPyh74GKvEog", "user_id": "Iav_-b9JZYFvV_BCHHPCkw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Wonderful Clam Chowder and Incredible Fish Tacos. The Chowder has more clams than any I've had anywhere and I doubt one can find better, even in the northeast U.S.The Fish Tacos are unique. They are wrapped more like a burrito, but they are stuffed with perfectly fried (or grilled) catfish and nice proportions of cheese, fresh veggies, and a great house-made sauce. The Gumbo is also very tasty with a lot of shrimp seemingly added on top when served so as not to over cook the shellfish."}, {"review_id": "UNCTbx6VlQTwzR2w5SwscA", "user_id": "MreCDanf9crlKR9ZUcb2Kw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I work across the street from this restaurant!

I was greeted and seated as soon as I walked in. The place looks upscale but it is casual with good lighting and nice ambience. I ordered the Firecracker Shrimp as an appetizer - highly recommended! It's crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside and it's seasoned with just the right amount of spice and creaminess. For my main entree, I got the 7oz Top Sirloin and Gulf Shrimp dinner plate. It's $14.95 and comes with baked potato and a choice of side. I replaced the baked potato with mashed potatoes and gravy and had Southwest Quinoa as a side. The plate also comes with a small serving of rice and an onion ring.My server also recommended the fried catfish so I ordered a piece to add to my plate. It's only a $1.50 per piece! Glad to have tried it - it's flavorful but not too salty.My overall experience at FD's Grillhouse was good. My server, Nicole, was really friendly and attentive. Quick and excellent service.

I was not impressed. Cheddars is much better! We got here at about 4:30pm and the parking lot was pretty empty. We got inside and there was a 20-25 minute wait. There were visibly empty tables so I don't know why there was a wait. Our server was nice, but only offered to refill our drinks as we were getting ready to leave. Our food was to our table within 5 minutes of our order, which was great, except the food it's self was not all that great. Once again cheddars is better. My chicken tenders were soggy and not crisp. My carrots were of a mushy consistency and tasted like they came out of a can. My daughter grilled chicken was chewy and hard to cut. The prices for the food were average. The building is out of the way and was kinda hard to find. I will just go to cheddars next time.
