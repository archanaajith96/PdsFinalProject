They have excellent drink specials, good food, and a friendly staff. I felt at home the minute I sat down and immediately felt like I was at my own local pub. The crowd was relaxed and in a good mood even late at night. The entire place had a coziness that is great for a group of friends or stopping in for a drink for a date night. I genuinely appreciate places like Swingin' Door that feature PBR on special along with a tasty craft. Good work team, good work."}, {"review_id": "fN1Idyq9YWZQ0AbvK95A1Q", "user_id": "QkNuVpkhV_wTApylrKOMDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I was in town on business and looking for an place to have a simple meal on my last evening in town. This place was walking distance and had good reviews on Yelp, so I decided to give it a shot. I guess it was a good sign that the place was completely full when I arrived, including the entire bar area. That was a bit crowded and noisy for the low-key dinner I wanted to have, but would have been good if I had been looking for a lively beer-and-appetizers deal. They told me that it would probably take a while to get a table in the restaurant area, but I decided to wait since I had nowhere else to be and it was COLD outside. Their estimate was pretty accurate and it did take quite a while, but once I was seated, I was read the list of specials and asked if I'd like something to drink. My beer (Spotted Cow) showed up quickly even though the place was at capacity. My waitress, Katie, I think, was very nice and made suggestions regarding beers and food. I was so hungry that I didn't remember to take pictures of my food, but I had a daily special mushroom soup to start and a Spicy Hungarian: a 1/3 lb. locally-made spicy sausage on a french roll with sauerkraut. The sausage did have a nice kick to it and the sandwich was very tasty and more than enough food for me. Katie checked on me periodically to make sure I was doing OK and didn't need anything else, and the bill was processed efficiently. I really can't have asked for more. I would come back to try some of the more interesting specials and regular menu items."}, {"review_id": "5N7VxNPrSnHZvs7HWRJkiQ", "user_id": "2YgeEVXH8jSg1k4Tw2sK2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I'm so happy that we came across this place when visiting Milwaukee for the first time for a baseball game, and better yet that we luckily came on a Friday for the fish fry. My partner and I both got the 3-piece cod (our stomachs are always bigger than our eyes) and the potato pancake special, and of course a couple of Moon Man beers. Everything was fantastic. The potato pancakes were some of the best that we've ever had, and the cod was delicious and perfectly done. We came at a good time (at around 8 p.m. on a Friday) and we were seated right away without a wait.

Although it is a bar, I was pleasantly surprised to find it has a separate and well appointed dining room. It is comfortable and intimate. The lighting is dim, the ambiance is relaxed, the music is FANTASTIC, but not too loud. It is easy to carry on a conversation here. The tables near the windows are lovely. The service was great (thanks, Ana). The drinks are a great size - we really enjoyed the \"Man-mosa.\" The food was delectable. They have a short, dedicated brunch menu with off menu breakfast specials. They started us out with a complimentary glazed donut which was mouthwatering. We also enjoyed the french toast, the beet salad with ahi tuna, and the eggs with potato pancakes/ hashbrowns, and bacon. I look forward to returning, and bringing my family next time!"}, {"review_id": "s31y3NTk4Cb9vb5lAZ8FQA", "user_id": "7brw50bVrBWkhuSQ1WL_lg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Best \"Bar and Grill\" I have been to in MKE to date.  Something for everyone on the menu ... vegetarians, gluten free, meat eaters ...We tried the Brussel sprouts (SO good ... sweet and spicy pecans with siracha sauce)  and onion strings for appetizers.Their homemade creole soup was AMAZING.  Such good flavor.  they had 3 homemade soup options.We all split the vermouth carrots ... they are a must.I had the beet salad with blacked ahi ... the tuna was done perfectly (rare - medium rare) and the dressing was great with the marinated beets.The others at the table had the sliders and said they were delish!

Good food, good drinks, good service, good prices, and friendly atmosphere.Every time we're seeing a show at The Riverside, you'll find us at Swingin' Door beforehand. Usually we'll wait for a table in the dining room, but since they have these super handy \"tables\" that sit on the bar top, we've started just staying at the bar.The Prime Dip with battered fries is my go-to. It's huge, and served on a fresh baked French roll which is the perfect mix of soft and chewy, and melts in your mouth when dipped in the house jus. The battered fries? Some of the best I've ever had. Oh, and the pickle they serve on the side is amazing too, and I'm a pickle fiend. Only downside is you're going to want more than one, and they now charge you 25 cents for each extra pickle spear. I don't care, they taste so good.I'm a sucker for Schlitz on tap (what? Schlitz pairs with anything!), but, they also have a superb cocktail menu. Oh, and they're home to one of the best drink deals in Milwaukee: three cans of PBR for only $5.The food specials are also always a great option. I mean, really, we've never had a bad or even mediocre dish.

I had the Spicy Hungarian sausage - wow, really good. I'm not a huge meat eater and sausage for lunch seemed a bit much but so glad I did. Large sausage on an even larger bun (that I mostly skipped). Hubby had the Ahi Tuna Steak which was also very good. But...The Spicy Vermouth Carrots. These are freaking amazing. The server explained to us how they make them and I was excited to try it at home until he got to the \"secret spices\".
