Bravo on your 4 Stars from the culmination of 2,000ish reviews.So, coming in around 7ish, we were immediately seated (no wait). Maybe it was cause we were a small \"party.\"There were utensils, menu's, and condiments waiting for us on the table.After chattering, my friend and I settled for: 9-piece sashimi, the Mizu Jumbo roll. Oh and we also got edamame, salad, and tempura. Let's just state three facts: Food is expensive here. Portions are big. Everything is fresh.The Mizu Jumbo had a lot stuffed in it (e.g., shrimp tempura, eel, asparagus, and cucumber) with lots of toppings (e.g., tuna sashimi, avocado, tempura flakes, tobiko, green onion, sriracha aioli, unagi sauce, and sriracha) on top (ha). To put it modestly, it was flavorful. I was also super full about 3/4 of the way through the roll (but then again, I was munching on edamame).The service was excellent from both Juan and Ji-eun.Last but not least, the interior is pretty nice (a mixture of dim lights and brighter lights scattered throughout a spacious, classy, and clean space). You can witness like five sushi chefs concocting their sushi masterpieces. There are both booth and regular table seating available. What else...they offer free valet parking?I'm not sure what else to say. Here's to Mizu!"}, {"review_id": "-0uWsss01iSHVEoWrsv_dQ", "user_id": "ZP6YU4rFqumYAL7V5RFT8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Instead of waiting for a table on a Friday night at Mizu, we opted for a spot at the bar where multiple TVs featuring sports lined the wall. We watched the chefs as they churned out plates after plates of orders like an assembly line.Soon as we took out seats, the waitress brought us two glasses of water and two bowls of miso soup.Thereafter, one of the chef handed us our first order - spicy tuna salad sprinkled with roe eggs, cuts of avacado, cucumber, and generous cubes of tuna. The refreshing, mildly spicy salad covered in a creamy miso sauce left my palate yearning for more with each bite.Moments later the waitress brought out the chirashi - a bowl scattered with thick cuts of tuna (3), salmon (3), hamachi (3), and chutoro (3) nicely set atop a mound of rice. Tamagoyaki (a light, sweet Japanese folded omelet), butterfly shrimp, seaweed, and shreds of daikon complemented the beautifully garnished bowl. Unbeknownst to us, the chef added three extra pieces of tai (red snapper).A seat at the bar is great because there's not much of a wait for your order and you're entertained by the non-stop action in front of you, however, it's bad because servers are constantly reaching for orders that may be set in front of you. Nonetheless, it was a satisfying experience worth a return visit."}, {"review_id": "4tbhghQbMfk-Qv6_skNBug", "user_id": "xiPHebmfOciA-qlwYkr-3A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Rolls are okay. 12-15$Wouldn't get the Sashimi again.

Chicken, beef AND salmon teriyaki. Black cod and get this, spicy pork! They have a lot of fun rolls that use a lot of different seafoods and different sauces like spicy mayo, sauce of eel and the on trend sriracha.

I think we were seated at 19 mins, but her accuracy left us impressed.We tried:-yellowtail tartar: good, but it tastes the same w/ and w/o the quail egg mixed in-gyoza: mediocre; just about the same wherever you go-crunchy roll: HARD PASS. We were hungry and definitely ordered, and this was the worst thing we ordered. We didn't even finish it.-various pieces of nigiri, which my fiance said were okay-miso black cod: flaky, soft, melts in your mouth, buttery goodness. So delicious!Service was ok.

The service was pretty bad. Where do I begin? The hostess seated another big party before us even though we arrived first. She wasn't courteous and barely made conversation or eye contact. Our server was rude and distasteful. He stopped at our table to take our order and only came back to drop the order off. He didn't come back to check in on us any point in time after that. In fact, our drinks were delayed and my friend's drink was never placed. I would rather go to other sushi places and give small business my money instead of this place due to their service. Sorry but they lost me there. I literally JD to flag a Spanish speaking bussed to get a box to go. Thank goodness I speak Spanish otherwise I would've felt like I was burdening the waiter by asking for a box to go. Food:Crispy rice w/ spicy tuna - ok presentation with little flavor and rice just not crispy. Sun missed roll - this was also ok. Fish tasted fresh but the sauce didn't compliment the combo of Spicy tuna and salmon. Garlic edamame - this is hard to get wrong. Nonetheless it was A+ Rainbow blossom - it was tasty, scallops were crispy, this roll seemed freshly made. Spicy tuna poppers - ummmm this one was interesting. Order if you like spicy (wasn't to spicy for my taste though). Yami Yami - friend tells me this was really good (the nice guy). Fish was fresh and instagram worthy (his words not mine)."}, {"review_id": "VN2Pbp1D-BM30UpoIiTCoA", "user_id": "zTJuO3-aHV9Z8tMPnmfjow", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I had a reservation for a party of 5 at 7:15 pm.

From walking in the door to seeing all the artwork being served to people, it certainly is a dining experience. The whole restaurant is smartly decorated in a tastefulModern decor, (with the exception of some spotlighted and strangely out-of-place *wall decorations - artificial flowers on each pillar). The long sushi bar is against the back with five sushi chefs busy preparing their orders.The tables neatly laid out to maximize the amount of guests and the servers very attentive and efficient (as each table were ready to leave a waiter would say a farewell and immediately change the table - Bravo for efficiency! But there was some *small bits of food under our table.We ordered the Winchester Roll and the Miso Cod. Pre-meal servings of miso soup (great dashi stock flavor and not too salty!) and the token salad (which looked like someone had hurriedly chopped some lettuce and literally splashed/drowned the lettuce with dressing, as if someone barfed it up. Don't get me wrong, the sweet dressing with mayo and sesame seeds was delicious, but the *presentation was just not appetizingly made.  The Winchester Roll and the Miso Cod were first rate in taste and presentation, and were absolute works of art. Just beautiful! The Winchester was tasty and was larger than other sushi restaurants (more for your money). Though, each piece of the precision-cut roll was *too big to fit completely in your mouth - something that is essential for any sushi - and I laughed seeing my wife's cheeks blow out trying to eat a piece. And the Miso Cod was flavorful, moist and tender - it just melted in your mouth! Though the deep-fried shavings of potato was a good substitute for crispy rice noodles, a few guests at the next table were amused seeing me trying to eat these crispy potatoes with chopsticks. There was no easy way to eat them, and in doing so *I looked like a horse chewing on some hay. . .Of course, this review would not be complete without mention of the restrooms. Assuming the women's room is the same, the men's room was neat and roomy, with clean sinks and mirrors. The ever-present smell of urine, however, made my nose wrinkle - not a good sign for a restaurantof this caliber.It just irks me when restaurants who really have a good thing - great food, great service, an efficient staff, wonderful and artful chefs and good decor - just ruin it by not going the whole nine yards, so to speak. Asterisked above, mismatched decorations, not a clean floor under the table, main course artful, but the salad looked like vomit, sushi should be bite-sized, not so large as to make someone look like a puffer fish, sides, toppings difficult to eat, and smelly restrooms. I would give this establishment a full five stars if crossed every t and dotted every i and really went all the way to make this a total dining experience rather than focus on the main attraction."}, {"review_id": "AzYN_QCYmfiNMiTIeIeyxg", "user_id": "Bz18uiLmkBp7ojnjnZH6Yw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Do you love sushi and live in the South Bay or vacationing in the area?Definitely give Mizu Sushi Bar & Grill in San Jose (or for those in the Orange County, Southern California - Tustin, California location) a try!Using high quality ingredients to create their dishes, Mizu offers a fusion of Japanese and Korean flavors.One of the reasons why we selected Mizu Sushi Bar & Grill was because it was one of the few restaurants in San Jose that was open past 10.Parking near the area was quite easy as it's near a shopping complex.  But what surprised me was the interior.The place had a good viewing of the chefs, televisions showing sports games, bar area with its blue neon lights.But you know a restaurant is popular when it's packed.  So, this was great to see!Customer service was excellent as the waitress knew what to recommend, was very good in letting us know the level of spiciness for the various sushi rolls.While I would love to visit this restaurant moreso during the day or afternoon, the restaurant serves quite a bit of dishes and from what I saw, the atmosphere was busy yet vibrant.My experience at Mizu Sushi Bar & Grill was quite positive and the food was delicious and didn't taste as if it was left standing for too long.  In fact, it was created fresh and that's all I can ask for.  Ingredients were well integrated in my roll and for the most part, I know I will be returning again!Mizu Sushi Bar & Grill is recommended!"}, {"review_id": "aZ_U85D62c60uQ51RFVq4w", "user_id": "DAz8Jl25YvdbXjRX4_Pt5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Japanese Korean fusion.

All the rolls we've ordered are really good. Cajun Tuna Sashimi ($15): This is my favorite dish. Thinly sliced seared tuna in cajun seasoning with green onions, carrots, and jalapeno​s. The sauce is super tasty! Comes with 8 pieces of seared tuna, super light appetizer. This is definitely a must-have. Salmon Carpaccio ($11.50): Also a very light dish. The ponzu sauce makes the sashimi slightly tangy. I also liked this appetizer, however, ​I found myself dipping the salmon into the Cajun Tuna sauce. Mizu Jumbo ($16.5): Includes shrimp tempura, asparagus, cucumber, topped with tuna, tempura flakes, avocado, green onions, tobiko with spicy aioli. Extremely yummy. Each piece is big and took two bites to finish.Crispy Rice w/ Spicy Tuna ($13): Decent order. I personally can't eat spices very well. This roll was too spicy for me being topped with jalapenos and siracha sauce. But my family seemed to enjoy it. The reason I didn't give Mizu 5-stars is that​ when we got our check, it was over $200. When we looked at how many dishes were ordered on the check, it stated 10. However, we counted only 9 plates ordered. Turns out they overcharged us for wagyu tataki (~$20) that we didn't order!! Not sure if this was a mistake or intentional, but with our party of 8, it could have easily been overlooked. However, when questioned, the waiter promptly adjusted our check. They could easily slip in a bogus order. And we almost fell for it. After this incident, I went on Yelp and found several similar stories as well. So BE CAREFUL and double check when paying, especially when you're in a big group."}, {"review_id": "8crnhhAHFcAkeOPArAneKg", "user_id": "1WdZ6aeZKPik8kljg8-YFw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "Mizu is a great date spot and has some of the best sushi in the South Bay. We came on a Wednesday night at 7 pm and were seated immediately. The decor was festive and romantic. We ordered the Yami Yami and Rainbow Blossom. Both dishes came quickly, in 10 minutes. Rainbow Blossom: 5/5 stars: Flavorful tuna and smoked salmon on top, and REAL crab meat (not imitation!) inside. Arranged very beautifully. We weren't expecting this, but there were lots of deep-fried balls of Scallop (i think) and wasabi mayo. very delicious! Yami Yami is 3/5 stars: I wasn't a fan of the super fishy smell emanating from the Whitefish. The rice was deep-fried, which was interesting but it made the roll fall apart very easily. We couldn't really pick up a single sushi piece, as the entire roll was connected. The flavor from the salmon and wasabi mayo was good, but tasted very similar to the rainbow blossom. I wouldn't get this particular roll again. And I would try to order rolls that are more distinctive from each other. Mizu has a huge array of sushi dishes to choose from, as well as entrees, soups, and salads. We were interested in the $25 sashimi platter which has 9 sashimis, but ultimately thought it wouldn't be enough food. Ordering two sushi rolls was very filling, as Mizu is more generous than other sushi restaurants portion-wise.

Ever since I had a bad experience at my old time fave Sushi O Sushi.. I've been on the hunt for a better sushi spot. My budget usually allows for my boyfriend and I to dine at the AYCE sushi spots to avoid breaking the bank but my boyfriend wanted to take me here for an early birthday dinner! I am pretty tired of going to those sushi spots where all the rolls are doused in unagi sauce and spicy mayo to cover up the lack of fresh fish so I was so happy to find that Mizu made very fresh tasting rolls and did not overdo it on the sauces and they did not skimp on the fish at all!We ordered the:Honeymoon special - perfect appetizer to order on a date! It comes with two pieces. This dish is on fire...literally!! It came out flambé style and a great way to \"heat things up\" on a date ;) Ok enough with the puns! This was was good. When it came out I asked the waitress how do I eat it. Definitely DO NOT put the flaming piece of sushi in your mouth unless you want serious burns. Wait a couple of minutes for the flame to burn out and then eat it! My only issue with this is the alcohol used to make the flame was on the rice making it taste odd but it was still good!Sashimi appetizer - this one came with 9 pieces. 3 hamachi (yellowtail), 3 salmon, and 3 tuna. My boyfriend and I loved the yellowtail the best. It was so fresh and melt in your mouth good. The salmon was fatty and delicious as well. The tuna was alright we didn't like it as much. Maybe it was too lean? I probably prefer the fatty tuna. Rainbow Blossom roll - this one had a great presentation. It was delicious and definitely didn't skimp on the fish! The top was covered with little mini deep fried scallops which was very good! And the fish was fresh as well as the crab used was not imitated. It has spicy mayo drizzled over the top but it was not overwhelming at all. Alaskan roll - my boyfriend's favorite is the lion king roll which we didn't see that they had here, so we opted for this baked salmon roll. It was very simple not too mayo-ey and it was great! It didn't come wrapped in foil or anything and it was delicious and simple. Overall our experience was nice. We came the day after Xmas on a Tuesday night at around 6. Wait time was 30 minutes without a reservation. It was a full house and the waitress could have been more attentive but in her defense it was very busy. Our waters didn't get refilled until we were paying the bill. So service was 4/5 and the food was 5/5. We will be back for another special occasion!
