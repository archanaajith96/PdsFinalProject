Like within a few weeks of him taking me there, he, like a little puppy, asked me uber excitedly if I'd been back since. Haven't had a chance dude!I was surprised that at 9PM on a weeknight a) there was a line b) kids were awake in said line for dinner! You know it's legit if the line is long that late. My friend led the way and ordered a handful of tacos. I got a chicken, al pastor, and a carne asada. Al pastor was the best of the three. All over-flowing with fillings and a really good fresh tortilla. Their salsa bar isn't too bad either, especially the non-spicy salsas. I checked into Yelp to get the free chips & salsa, and I'm glad they were free. Quite the disappointment, the chips were stale and the salsa was just bad. Save the check-in and spend money on something else like a quesadilla or an extra side of guac or even an extra taco!"}, {"review_id": "NgjMpREXqzE-6WrbtuWCvQ", "user_id": "ATzhj6cbaGZnNV5E4OAZCQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "We tried the food here based on the recommendation of a friend and after seeing the reviews on Yelp and Google I knew it had to be great!There were four in our group and we came at 1:00pm on a Sat. It was packed! There wasn't a lot of parking, so we felt lucky when someone pulled out of a spot right when we turned into the lot.The smell of smoked meat hits you as soon as you get out of the car. It smelled like we were at a BBQ joint and not a Mexican restaurant. It smelled like some really good smoked meats were waiting to be eaten!Then there was the wait... We waited in line for close to 30 minutes! I realize this restaurant is highly rated and has a loyal following but that line moved REALLY slow! And because the place is SO small and not laid out well, people are walking in front of you and behind you the whole time you're in line. If you're someone who doesn't like people in your personal space (like me), then turn around if you see a long line here.After we ordered we waited another 10-12 minutes for them to call our number. I highly recommend getting your salsa while your food is being prepared. I wish I would have thought of that because there was another long line for the salsa. I waited another 10-12 minutes for salsa and when it was finally my turn, the green salsa was completely out and it was way too loud and busy to get any of the employees' attention. By the time I finally got to sit down and eat I was irritated and thinking this would have to be the best Mexican food I've ever had to go through all of that waiting. It wasn't! In fact, after having to go wait in line for salsa for so long, my food was barely warm when I got back. We decided between the four of us we would try everything on the menu. The food was good and I would say better than most of the competition (Filiberto's and most of the local taco joints). On this particular day, having to wait about 45 minutes from the time I arrived to eat and then the food not being very warm by the time I ate, there was no way this place seemed like it deserved the high ratings. And it was a bit pricey for a tiny place in the older part of Mesa. For my wife and I, we ordered four tacos, a Gordita, a burrito and two large drinks and it was almost $30! The burrito was large and the lemonade was good. The Gordita, which seemed more like a Tostada, was overpriced and so were the tiny tacos. (Except people seem to have all accepted paying $2.00 - $2.50 for street tacos these days). The other two people in our party who have lived in the area a lot longer than we have (35 years vs 11 years), said it wasn't as good we hyped it up to be).When we left at 2:00, there was no line at all! So maybe we'll come back another time when it's not as busy and see if the hot food and shorter lines can make it a better experience. For now, it just seems like yet another place in the Valley with a really high rating on Yelp that doesn't deserve it."}, {"review_id": "yTIDiYq7q-5xFQ4-DXdOuw", "user_id": "bI0lvh1gm7lcI3nOrQTc7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I was in the Phoenix area for Spring Training and was craving tacos. I knew there would be a lot of great Taco places but I decided to give this one a shot . Small private parking lot on the side that wraps to the back of the restaurant . Outdoor seating available under a overhang with heat lamps mounted . Table seating inside very minimal . Clean for the most part. I came around dinner time on a weekend and it was starting to get crowded. Walk in, order and wait for them to call your number . Salsa bar to the right of where you order / pick up your food. Person at register was friendly and you could tell people in the kitchen were hustling . I ordered tacos (corn or flour tortilla with several meat options ) , quesadilla and free chips / salsa with check in (at the time). Order was quick. I sat outside (more space then inside). Tacos were BOMB! so good and filling . Quesadilla was good along with chips and salsa . Price was decent . If you are in the area and want some good tacos fast, come here!"}, {"review_id": "E5WeDLMDHUUKBwJc8TI6kg", "user_id": "TCPLaprJm4FFei2DkW6K6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "We rarely venture over to Mesa. And even when doing so, food options seem incredibly limited while browsing through Yelp. Backyard Taco always shows up in searches, but I always feared it would be a situation like up in Anthem, where a place gets glowingly positive reviews, not necessarily because it's good, but because it's the ONLY place available, so the locals simply just don't know any better.I can confidently say that this definitely isn't the case with Backyard Taco - as their tacos easily made it to our shortlist of some of the best that we've found in our search.The standout taco is clearly their asada, that has that lovely charcoaled and smoky flavor that I have such a hard time finding in Phoenix. The other tacos, including the al pastor and birria are good, but their asada is clearly the most popular for a reason. The mesquite-grilled approach is a style that I wish more taco places would adopt.Things can get pretty hectic at times. When the lines get understandably long, you're often cutting through in order to access the salsa bar and might have a difficult time finding seating. But it's never been a significant issue during the handful of times we've visited.On a side note, I've always been kind of baffled why their second location in Gilbert doesn't receive quite as much praise at the original spot in Mesa. Nevertheless, in terms of cheap tacos, this will always be a favorite choice.Highly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "hlpOPGKdfYQqiXNBrbYQow", "user_id": "LS0Cj5IiH28NnSChCLPSQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I love backyard taco. Even though it is far for me, it is awesome and worth the drive. I love the open kitchen, the huge grill, and all the workers just making it happen. I usually get anything with steak. Steak tacos are money and so is the steak burrito. Man it's so filling that burrito. It is all simple, clean, and quick. They know how to do Mexican food. The salsa bar is pretty money. I'm not sure if they are their own recipes or ordered somewhere, either way it's awesome. The pickled red onion is one my favorites and the cucumber. The green salsa and pico are my go to. Taco Tuesday is the play. They have discounts on tacos during Tuesday from 2-10. For about 3 adults and 2 kids we order about 15-20 tacos and are straight. I usually eat 5 myself. If you want amazing tacos and one of the best in the valley go here"}, {"review_id": "3jEewX9uAZoTPyb2TAslsQ", "user_id": "PlHNL9OL1-RKf2qLwt25VQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I've heard many things about this place.

It's a busy taco shop with both indoor and outdoor seating - so don't be surprised when there are flies flying around your table inside as well. You can see them cooking your food and grilling your meats behind the counter. There's also a self serve salsa bar to the right of the line. What I really came for was the Crazy Potato al pastor. I tried some when my brother brought one home the other week and it was delicious! Spoon full of meat, potato, and cilantro. Well, when I had it for myself, I quickly found that the cup didn't give me the portions I was looking for. It came with plenty of potato and cilantro but not enough meat to last evenly. Good idea though! Loaded potato in other words. We also ordered one of each taco. In my opinion, I've had better carne. However I am a fan of their pastor. Tip: check into Yelp for a free side of chips and salsa."}, {"review_id": "iJIJvsRLPQfA3Ip-SCATzA", "user_id": "L4dg-hA4Ek0M9sSBMJCqWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I have been to Backyard Taco after my first review numerous time. It has now become my go to taco place especially for shredded meat. The consistency, quality of food and delicious taste keep us coming time and time again. I have recently tried their crazy baked potato and it was just as delicious.I usually go for the vegetarian one and I'm always tempted to try the one with meats but I have not yet. I also always order Jamaica which is my favorite drink. So cool and refreshing, I just love the flavor. The atmosphere here is very casual. I have come here during the day, at night, afternoon, it's always busy and buzzing with people. Prices are pretty average. Their menu options are pretty good but I always order the exact same thing which is Birria because I just absolutely love it. It's always juicy and tasty, I have not been there a single time and wasn't happy when I left. They do not serve any seafood items, so keep that in mind if you're interested in fish or shrimp tacos. I have come across their new Gilbert branch once. It looked really nice on the outside, very different from this location which is the original branch. Due to distance, this will probably always be my favorite location."}, {"review_id": "vV1W1I_ouiXNkrZcRTAZsQ", "user_id": "lWwlPEbkR-yUt057Oc_wjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "Well, as you might already know from the other reviews, this place is awesome! The food is excellent. The pastor tacos are excellent, so is the chicken, and carne asada...did not order birria so cannot vote on that one but one could only assume it would be equally amazing! I must let you all know something...get the Papa Loca! It is Stupid good. The tortillas are good, the salsas are good, the service is great but the darn Papa Loca is THE BEST on the menu. Upon walking in, or should I stay, standing in line outside waiting to get in. The anticipation starts. It's like \"give me my food! NOW!\" You want it, bad. It all there right in front of you like a candy store...just have to wait your turn. The best thing about killer food is when they only have four meats on the menu and four ways to order them (love that). That is a wise, strong call for \"we got the best, don't need random hipster crap to fill a menu\" :)The place was beyond packed, the wait time was rather quick considering though. I wish they had one of these set up more like 'sit at bar, enjoy a Mexican beer and kill six tacos' places in addition to this awesome place. For now, this place is holding the bar really high for every other taco shop though. Keep it up there Backyard Taco, great job, great everything :)PAPA LOCA!!!!"}, {"review_id": "LT85chw31wVV7X-qzXkXwA", "user_id": "-kQkrKDXs12XiXVz18Bvxg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "We enjoy the Gilbert Backyard Taco, and thought that we would give dinner at Backyard Taco Mesa a try. Wow, what a difference in locations!This location is in a rough area of town. It is sparsely lit, with lots of foot traffic in the area. There is no drive-thru here, which was disappointing. The shop itself was small and very busy. I noted that there was outdoor seating in the front, and also on the east side of the building. The parking lot was small, dark and congested. The interior was busy, and was a disorderly, hot mess. If it is busy, you will have a hard time walking in. The line goes from the ordering counter out the door. Once you order, there is really nowhere for you to go. So everyone is still standing in the ordering area. This also happens to congest the area in the back corner where folks are trying to get to the salsa bar. When it was my turn to order, the gal at the counter walked away. I was not acknowledged, and just stood there like a dummy. A man who struck me as the franchisee or manager asked if I had been helped. I said I had not, and he asked me what I would like to order. However, he just walked over to the girl who had left me in the first place, and told her my order. They squabbled Â for a minute over things she had to do first, then she approached the counter. She asked again what I would like. I ordered two al pastor quesadillas, an order of chips and salsa, and two drinks. She then tells me that the card system is down, and she has to write down my card number and charge me later. I should have said no and walked away, but I felt obligated at that point. I asked her about the destruction process once the charge was entered, and she did little to dispel my worries.My food comes out rather quickly, but no drinks. I tell the gal I had two beverages, and she snaps at me to go to the drink counter and someone can get them. The only person there is the owner/manager guy, who I will say was very personable and took care of my drinks. (Not before asking \"No one got your drinks yet either?\") I got home with my food, which was underwhelming. I don't know that I would call it a quesadilla, because I'm pretty sure that there was zero cheese. It was more like a larger sized taco, with fatty al pastor with too many onions and abundant cilantro. But even the cilantro couldn't help this flavorless, ill-cut meat. Also, I'm pretty sure I got the bottom of the chip bowl. I had ONE whole chip and a bunch of small pieces I could eat with a spoon. While it's hard to mess up drinks, and the diet Coke was normal, my Jamaica tasted as if double the powder was put in by mistake...so sweet! I had to transfer cups and add water.I would not likely visit this Backyard Taco location in the future. And please, cross your fingers for my credit card information's safe and thorough destruction!"}, {"review_id": "q6_PG-eoOt9gj8zshxx48w", "user_id": "m29etug8MChCOmBrKWYwpw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Great tacos but NO BEER!

They do have taco Tuesday for $1.80 a taco, if I remember correctly.Regular price is around $2.20 or something close to that. Came around lunch time, right before he got super busy.Right after you parked their car and you're on your way inside, you can smell the meat. Always a good sign. They have a pretty big menu with all your basic stuff besides tacos as well. However I came wanting to try the tacos. I order a al pastor, carne asada and Pollo on corn tortilla. With everything that comes with it. Then I went over to the salsa bar, which was pretty good. They have a maybe for types of salsa. They had the spicy, on the green, and two other ones. And I had Limes which i loved. They also had the cucumber and the radish I believe. And they also had some of the onions, purple looking onions. And of course the pico de gallo. Overall, the salsa bar was amazing. You can keep refilling as you desire.Didn't take too long for the tacos to get made. Service was quick. cashier was friendly.Check the picture for the tacos.Taste:Overall, I could eat all the tacos a second time at the same sitting.Full of flavor, I also did add pretty much all these salsa and toppings on my tacos. The meats weren't too dry And they have flavor.For the al pastor Taco, they do have pineapple, but I did not get as much meat as I would have liked.For the carne asada and the pollo, you get a decent amount. Tacos were falling apart after I talked everything on the tacos. Use a fork.Parking lot is Tiny, and if you do come here around lunch time there might not be any parking.Restroom is clean.They do have outdoor seating as well with water sprinklers during the day.Seating inside is possible, could become limited real quickly.Overall, would definitely come here again for the tacos, especially on Taco Tuesday because of the price.
