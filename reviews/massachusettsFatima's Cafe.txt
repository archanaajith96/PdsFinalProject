Our vegetarian friend found it when visiting, so she convinced us to try it. So glad we made the trip to Worcester North!  We greatly enjoyed the fruit juice made with berries and juice, a great portion for the $3.50 cost! Maybe could have been a little colder is my only \"complaint.\" I enjoyed the texture of the seeds too.We split the trio of empanadas appetizer, all delish, I really enjoyed the mixed veggie. The other half enjoyed the empanadas so much- a trio of beef made up their entree. I got the lamb wrap- hilib ido, WOW. like lamb brisket!!!!! Crisp notes, soft tender, flavorful meat, with sweet onions and peppers melted alongside; and a crispy, panini pressed wrap.  So yummy. Our vegetarian friend really enjoyed the veggie stews that she ordered. We got to try to silky \"spicy\" lentils (I was happy they weren't fiery hot!) and the yummy eggplant cauliflower stew. Can't wait to come back and try more!!!Notes: we happily arrived two weeks after the installation of new signs that identify the corner, the restaurant, AND the back parking lot!!!! Parking is available on the side street behind the store, and out chef / waiter informed us there was parking just after the store too (route 12 is a one-way here)"}, {"review_id": "2ipIaw5x71q936cmCSY2dA", "user_id": "As3CtS0HJ7IUBipw_RiJCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "After driving 45 minutes, we unfortunately couldn't give this place a shot.

If you're going to rent your ENTIRE restaurant our (despIte the party only taking up half the restaurant), maybe you could note that on your yelp or something.

The food here is so delicious. We ordered the spicy lentil and mixed vegetable samosas to start and they were great. For dinner we ordered the player to share which came with the spicy lentil, mixed vegetable, and eggplant stews on top of the Ethiopian bread. It certainly didn't disappoint. It probably should have feed three to four people, but my boyfriend and I just couldn't stop enjoying the delightful flavors. Unfortunately neither of us had enough room to try the Ethiopian doughnuts so we will just have to make another trip to Worcester someday."}, {"review_id": "TlEgpqToYEiWgR2qoji88w", "user_id": "H1HpkJObwWx1_d17uX3qpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This restaurant's food was delicious!

Kudos for bringing an unusual cuisine to Wormtown. It's African (not Middle Eastern as described on Yelp). This whole in the wall features a simple menu but the flavors pop. My fav was the piping hot veggie samosas and the lentils. The chai was amazing but I wish they had almond milk vs cow milk. Regretfully, they don't serve any nuts/nut milk on site.  The chapati fell a bit short as I found it rather oily and dense.  The place was packed by the time we left at 1 PM. A welcome addition to the local dining scene."}, {"review_id": "dw_WDU2D9eYk0XcxWW4llw", "user_id": "6GgfZk5X1iCuigdGAEXPeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Love this place. I get the samosas, the rice with sugoo, and Ugali. All flavors are on point. Great vegetarian selection and they'll add meat to anything. The food was not spicy, but they have a sauce that adds a nice kick if your palate can handle it. The owner and staff are extremely friendly and I get a great plate of food for a reasonable price. I typically do takeout so can't vouch for service, but the food is worth discovering this hidden gem in the north side of Worcester."}, {"review_id": "bum3wRh23771RVU9ZHGmLQ", "user_id": "PMCuIuGGiGMuxd3SWrGxIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Where else can you get great veggies, muhadara (toasted lentils, onions and brown rice), goat stew, samosas, delicious Chai, and that wonderful flat brad, Chapati -- all served with such joy?  You can't go wrong here, and if you're like me you need to be walked through the menu and so you shall."}, {"review_id": "-Fy4lgRo0n9qw53HCbJEYA", "user_id": "iTIRy8i_bJoYUk9FZKTd-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Great food, very casual and welcoming...a small jewel!The samosas were exceptional and the goat stew, delicious."}, {"review_id": "oVYYzH9Uw75z_vf79OypYw", "user_id": "iotJAs4ERb-x16L3slgvZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "The biggest reason I signed up on Yelp is these guys.  One of those little restaurants with so much heart and soul behind it.

This is a place that I want to bring everyone I know to. The food is incredible and there is nothing else like it in Worcester County. Seriously, try this place. The food:I have had the ugali with sukuma, the Somali Anjero with goat curry and various vegetable dishes, and the Kenyan chai tea. Everything that I have tried at Fatima's is succulently delicious and has you wanting more. I am especially fond of the goat curry. I also really have enjoyed getting to try Somail Anjero as opposed to Ethiopian Anjero. Somali Anjero is thicker and has a more sour flavor, which I find delicious. The Kenyan chai is very sweet and tastes strongly of cardamon, one of my favorite spices. It definitely works well as a light dessert. The service:All of the people I have met at Fatima's are very kind and welcoming. The food comes a little bit slowly, but that is how you know you are getting the best product!"}, {"review_id": "8FXQ4u6JJ849rbpdBJ2K_A", "user_id": "y7BzSKnMF8sDziou9N2tbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Stopped here for dinner after visiting WPI.  The owners were super friendly and gracious and explained the whole menu to us.  We ordered the samosas and they were delicious.
