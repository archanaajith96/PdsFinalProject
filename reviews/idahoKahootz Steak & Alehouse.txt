Wait staff were very friendly and attentive and made sure our wait was pleasant.Kahootz has a great lunch menu (dinner looks even better), especially if you're into red meat. Special for the day was clam chowder and fish and chips,  after all, it was Friday (when will the Friday \"fish\" thing ever end?).Chose not to go with the specials - wife decided on the Hawaiian Chicken Salad (they were nice enough to bring her a sample of the dressing before she ordered - always a 5 star move). She said it was very good, but way more than she could eat (don't you just hate people who say that as you're licking your plate clean?).  I went with the Rueben Sandwich, which was excellent!!!!! Well, almost. It is served on marble rye bread (a Rueben staple), Swiss cheese (another go to item), Stienfelds kraut, \"tons\" of House Roasted Corned Beef (maybe not tons, but a huge amount), and homemade 1000 island dressing. It is the last item that poses the problem with perfection - the amount of 1000 island dressing, mixed with the kraut, made it impossible to pick up the sandwich in a normal manner (the dressing basically soaked through the bottom half of the sandwich) - i had to eat it with my fork and knife. But that little inconvenience did not in any way take away the taste of the sandwich - excellent!!!!!!O, i did order a craft beer with the meal - Pako's Eye-P-A (cute, huh?) from Snake River Brewing. Wait person ask if I wanted a glass or mug - I like handles, so went with the mug - sometimes it pays to read the menu and actually listen to the wait staff - a glass is 16 oz and a mug is 25!!!! Made for a long afternoon nap - lol.All in all, Kahootz was a good experience, one that I hope to repeat in the near future."}, {"review_id": "PfsvTzx-HiQgct7sI12YlA", "user_id": "kPK2CDrMrjl12Z7J2akczQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Decent food and the beer selection was plentiful.  Not that great for kids: no milk-only soda and water.Nice place to sit and have a brew.Not sure what the draw here is.  The menu isn't as expansive as other ale houses but they seem to have a solid local following.This will probably be a Meridian must-do as time goes on.  Pretty ok"}, {"review_id": "6dLVTySy8X4d9iuEQ7vsWw", "user_id": "ypRJ5E7XYTexT5p9aK2ySg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "This place has amazing blue cheese dressing!!!  The appetizers are huge - definitely can double as a lunch order.  They even have steak specials at lunch."}, {"review_id": "szUesD-U-j4GprLxCqDs8Q", "user_id": "4uiTSfCDRKIWYT51KrKkvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We took friends who were in town visiting and wanted to try something local.  We arrived around 12:15pm and were pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a wait.  Everyone was happy with their selections of beer, apps and lunch entrees.  We will definitely be going back for lunch again soon!"}, {"review_id": "TDXcALeqJ9Jz1Qzd854Fvg", "user_id": "T_CNXu7zD9g2gpukFebgzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "We love this place.

The food is excellent, fresh and great specials daily. The steaks and prime rib won't disappoint! Also they have a ton of beer on tap!!!  Give this place a try...I dont think you will regret it...plus you get to support locally owned, which is never a bad thing!!4 stars not because of food, drink, or the staff those are all 5 star worthy. I gave it 4 stars because its very small, loud and sometimes very hard to get in. Also the decor is dated and dark."}, {"review_id": "k7trRQjeW0KI95pfOhzAEg", "user_id": "1oRnfHPSfHESzTy5hSchNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Forget about those roadhouse or Chandlers this is the best steak I have ever had.  The Bloody Mary was Bloody good.

I live right by this place... why didn't I find it sooner??? The top sirloin steak was perfectly cooked, so tender, so juicy, so flavorful...  The queso... How good can queso get? Apparently, stupid good. The beer I got was basically chosen via eenie meenie minie mo, and it ended up being the best beer I've had (Cheers, Honey Brown by Dundee brewery)! The quaint friendly ambiance and great service was the icing on the cake. This is probably the most incoherent review I've written, but I'm in disbelief.

I know, we are supposed to order steak at a steakhouse, but sitting outside in 95 degrees...fish seemed a little more appropriate. Since we were going with the tacos, we also ordered the queso dip. It was very good...loaded with jalapeños and onions, but the Tillamook cheese makes it great. The tacos were just ok. The corn tortillas were undercooked. The Cod had good flavor, however. The salsa is too mild for my taste. The service is excellent.
