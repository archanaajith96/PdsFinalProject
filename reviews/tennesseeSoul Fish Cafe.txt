Was there for work, but my family came up to spend Easter Sunday. We spend a lovely day at the zoo, then found some of the best food in Memphis. My sister had a Cuban sandwich, that was one of the best I've ever had. And yes, i stole a bite of my sister's sandwich, who doesn't do that to their younger sibling even in their 30s? I got the catfish platter, because, being from Mississippi, I needed to know how their catfish and hush puppies were. And they were WONDERFUL! I love a good hush puppy, and I could have made a meal out of them alone, but luckily I didn't have to, because the fish was just as good. But next time I eat here, I'm gonna eat that dang cuban sandwich. That was a my only regret."}, {"review_id": "8AiwKp8SaPm0Bq6t1Y29Nw", "user_id": "bxg2BqOq50e6UAaQrvBn4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Simply put: Quite possibly the best catfish I've ever had.After a long day of touring Graceland, we were starving.

I am just always satisfied with the quality of service that I receive each and every time I visit. I am in love with the new renovations. They have added a patio for diners who like to sit out and enjoy the weather. The inside is more spacious and it just feels bigger and better! On to the food! The food was awesome. I ordered a catfish basket..my fave! The fish is always prepared freshly and just right. It is seasoned right and not fried to hard or to softly. The sides are always amazing as well. The server was so friendly. She frequently checked on us and each time she did it with a smile. I have been dining with them for years and I KNOW I will be back! haha"}, {"review_id": "19yYDjZLWmRJRVF86B4QJA", "user_id": "mIxD836RkGWVmYyF6V5mzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "The catfish at soul fish cafe is delicious.

It was delicious. We ordered a side of zucchini with the catfish. It was a good combination with the catfish. The catfish basket 4.4/5Much crunchier then the blackened catfish. Tasted great!The catfish dishes were heavily seasoned with salt. Tasty but some parts were a little too salty. The fries and mac and cheese were okay, nothing memorable. Service was on point, our food came out fairly quick and refills were taken care of quickly. It can be a bit chilly inside, take a light jacket or sweater. We were seated immediately with no reservations made. Parking was a little cramped but we managed to find a spot. The interior decor is nice and modern.

We had about 12 people and they took great care of us. Our waitress was Merry Beth and she got everything right down to the last detail. Before I start talking about the food, disclaimer that I usually do not like fish. I'm not a picky eater but seafood has never been my thing. That being said, I ordered the chicken tacos. They were delicious and they showed up fast. But the food really worth mentioning was the catfish. My boyfriend ordered the catfish and got one piece blackened and one fried. I didn't get a chance to try the fried (it disappeared fast) but the blackened catfish was amazing. It melted in my mouth and I wanted more - which is big coming from me. We were in and out of Soul Fish pretty fast and the service was so smooth. Thank you, Merry Beth for taking such great care of us!"}, {"review_id": "m6ZIWe01mTmGqMz-WUWaEw", "user_id": "EvAsrko43gpGTMh25R2Lhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/26/2017", "text": "So I have a biased view on catfish based on a local fish house in the town I grew up in... but Soul Fish is AMAZING.The catfish is breaded in this delicious mixture and isn't ever greasy.

Their food is excellent and fresh, and the service prompt and friendly. The fried catfish is great- it has a crisp and crunchy exterior- not greasy- and a soft and flaky fish interior. Recommend pairing it with their sweet pickled green tomatoes- you can't get those everywhere, and they are DELICIOUS. The sides are all very good. They also have an excellent oyster po-boy- crunchy french bread with a soft interior and the oysters are big and flavorful. They don't skimp on the oysters either- this is a good size po-boy. Soul Fish features a good selection of local Memphis beers on tap for $5 a pint. Parking is free but can be tight in the restaurant parking lot. Lots of street parking available nearby in Cooper Young. Family friendly place, with enough room between tables if you need to squeeze in a highchair or stroller."}, {"review_id": "onZN3Hw_Qo9SMSytcTStkA", "user_id": "mDbW2WU6TIgbMoWyaaPaRg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "So incredibly average, what an utter disappointment. The catfish was small and fried like how I imagined Popeyes would fry catfish if they had it on their menu. The hushpuppies were bone dry and to top it off I paid $15 for three pieces of small catfish and hushpuppies.Paid $3 extra for coleslaw to counter the dry hushpuppies.

I had the cat fish dip as an appetizer. It was good. It tasted like a cross between chicken salad and tuna salad. But not fishy at all. It was served it with tortilla chips. I think it would've been even better if they served it with saltine crackers. Husband had the catfish basket with collard greens. He seem to like it. Ate the whole thing. I had the blackened shrimp and Cajun cabbage. Both were delicious. The hush puppies on the other hand, were a disappointment. The first ones that came out as part of our entrées were cold. Asked for a new ones. When they came out they were slightly warmer. The consistency and taste of the hush puppies were average. Nothing to write home about. The atmosphere is eclectic with the pictures of fish on the walls.
