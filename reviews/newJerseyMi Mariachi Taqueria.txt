However, on my 2nd visit, the tacos were really dry and underseasoned. 2) carnitas (roast pork) - also dry3) loganiza (sausage) - also dry4) Campechano (Heart & sausage) - It has a nice chew but sadly also dry5) asada (beef) - tough and dry6) lengua (beef tongue) - dryI used their entire container of cilantro sauce but it wasnt enough to overcome the dryness of the tacos. It is about $8-9/4 tacos.Credit given to the nice ladies that take your order and they are not expensive. However,  If I could pick between Taqueria Downtown vs here, I would pick the latter"}, {"review_id": "g4rAsrUXPDXhIOtjvcbaYg", "user_id": "6HiQQYZYhAjSmAuX89abNA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "As much as I absolutely LOVE the area (including NYC), good taco places are strangely few and far between. Full disclosure: I lived in Texas for five years before moving here and so I acknowledge I might be too picky when it comes to tacos and Mexican food. And so even though I'm giving it four stars, I will say it's probably closer to four and a half.This place is really good, WAY better than all of the places I've tried around here, and it's inexpensive too! It's in a small but not too small place near Journal Square, like a hidden gem. I am smiling as I'm writing this review.First ordered the chips and salsa~ was good. First of all, their chips were fresh made and thicker than the chips you might get at the supermarket; nice thick chips (corn tortilla chips, me thinks). Their salsa is green and limey, something different from the red you usually get at other taco places, but I liked it. We ordered tacos~ got the pastor and longanisa (though they have many to choose from). I especially digged the pastor since it came with tiny bits of pineapple that cooked along with the pork, giving a nice sweet and tangy flavor to it. Wanted to try the barbacoa but the waitress said they only have it on the weekends. Guess I'll have to come back on a weekend.Ah, so happy to have found this place! Will be back!"}, {"review_id": "0TGdIiElS3uACY4Mr0x7VQ", "user_id": "U31EtAEDIALiHdaQqMQsTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "the tacos were so meaty and tasty.

While there are a few seats inside, I usually order takeout. My go-to orders are the tacos (I get soft shell). I've had chicken, beef, and carnitas, and I'll ask for cilantro and onion. If you order three tacos, you can get them all with one meat OR two one meat and the third another kind of meat. You can't get three tacos with a different type of meat.

It's cheap, so unbelievably filling and the staff are friendly. I can't tell if they make their own tortillas but I have a feeling they do as the tacos have that unmistakably fresh taste you only get from super fresh tortillas. The al pastor and pollo go down well in my household but I order \"vegan\", and the staff are totally understanding about leaving out cheese and crema - it comes with beans, rice and usually avocado. The red salsa will blow your head off but the green has a nice, but milder, kick.

Mi Mariachi is one of best restaurants in JC and tied in my book with Boulevard Drinks for the best eats in the square.

Don't be afraid to try something new, the beef in the lengua tacos is so tender, you wont regret eating outside your comfort zone."}, {"review_id": "jmwrNPgQ_qD4VRUM4idA9w", "user_id": "2LpJb4uHZAeYmbEoPp2rUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "Shockingly inexpensive for insanely good food!

Yelp wants me to write more, so Is it possible to describe perfection? The sizzling heat of the grill seems to be seared permanently into their burritos whose corn tortillas crinkle delightfully, their integrity tested by the goliath of meat and dripping cheese they hold. Contrast this to the cool refreshment of imported Mexican Coca Cola or the bottles of Jarritos chilling lovingly in their fridge. Are you in love? No. Love is the feeble word we use for an ineffable sensation evoked by the food here. The food of Mi Mariachi. Did that help you? Probably not.
