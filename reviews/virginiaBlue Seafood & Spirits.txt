I inched my way to the front door ensuring the entire world knows \"I\" was first in line. The door opened at 4PM sharp. I beehived my way to the bar, picked my seat & attempted saving a seat. Within 15 minutes of opening, the bar was full! All seats were taken! I invited a friend who invited two more people and unfortunately they missed out. Snooze ya lose. The bar is NOT a place for large crowds or saving seats for late arrivals. Period. You will be overthrown by the regulars & I don't blame them! Lol. I would be the same way! The bar is the only section for the happy hour specials. Cut-throat! I totally get it. There are tables available for large parties. Arrive on time unless you like waiting. There was a wait for the dining area within 30mins of opening. The staff greeted me and all hands were on deck. Matt, the bartender was grinding through drink orders. The crowd at the bar felt like they were regulars, this was their normal Friday night, and I was the virgin! Ha! How exciting!!!! The energy was there. Not knowing what to expect, the chef came out with ceviche. The flavors were perfect! Lime juice, cilantro, onions, shrimp, & perfection! I initially ordered a wine, crabcake, & shrimp tempura. Then, the folks beside me ordered Oysters Rockefeller that weren't on the menu. Uhmmm yes please!! :) By far, one of the best Oysters Rock I've had in my lifetime. Then, folks on the other side of me shared their calamari!!! WHAT!? Winning!!! I was in like Flynn! Hahaa I made BFF's with some awesome ladies on both sides of me who were giving me recommendations the next time I visit Blue's! The bartender also delivers little baby sweet potato biscuits w/ delicious butter! Man oh man was I loving this dining experience! Haven't had one this memorable in awhile and I was certainly a pig-in-mud! Hope to come back soon and meet w/ the regulars I laughed with during this visit. Outstanding establishment, service, & food! Top-notch & a must try!"}, {"review_id": "kx9q0aTsTHoCt1ZfWMVNSA", "user_id": "oAdS1AI3gQHGFLVXb5qsjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I've been looking for a reputable, well priced, delicious seafood place for a while now. Too many tourist traps with mediocre food. But this place lives up to the 5 star reputation. This place gets busy (most of the locals know about it) so be ready to wait a little if it is a Friday/Saturday. But don't fret!!! The food is worth it.  Seating: good for small to mid-sized groups. No outdoor seating. And there's seating at the bar. Service: EXCELLENT, friendly, fast Cost: delicious food for a good price, not overpriced like the boardwalk. Food: mouthwatering, spiced perfectlyAmbiance: casual to semi casual.Overall I loved this place. Wonderful menu selections cooked to perfection! Raw oyster options are shucked perfectly (no broken shell or dirt left behind) and presented shortly after your order is placed. Fried oysters are plump and juicy. This is a great place to bring friends and family as well as out of state visitors. I'll be adding it to my \"must eat at\" places in Virginia Beach!"}, {"review_id": "6u3cpQew4Nx0Urw_S_pAcg", "user_id": "mZXW8WQhwpDOoFCP_j7lzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "THE BEST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE I'VE had in at least 3 years.  Food, service dessert, presentation, customer service...  HELL YEAH!!!As an entrepreneur, you absolutely appreciate when the owner ensures you and everyone around you has an optimal experience.   Every meal was better than the reviews, the three deserts we ordered for the table were all exceptional, it looked almost as good as it tasted...Did I mention the Waitstaff and Owner were perfectly attentive but not annoying?A completely unexpected experience during a much needed vacation."}, {"review_id": "spHoIwKGz8MK8RTKE21yUw", "user_id": "MrMJgS5RA5R3_B3KbyDWvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Amazing experience. Dinner is always best when served with plenty of options. Started with dirty martini that also included some fresh lemon and rosemary. I'd say give me one more blue cheese olive but surprisingly refreshing! Appetizers for us were soup, calamari and a dozen oysters on the half. The dip given for the calamari made us all want to lick our plate and fried calamari was pleasantly cooked. Soup was good flavor but not a standard she crab soup we have read about - spoonfuls of crabmeat with each bite and very very good. The oysters weren't bad - i search for salinity but am sure it is time of year. Dinners were fish of the day - tilefish - perfectly cooked with sauce to complement and not overtake. Scallops i was told were lightly fried (they come blackened grilled etc)....my fault for thinking lightly fried meant they were sautéed. It means they are breaded. I hate breaded seafood but this is very light and perfectlydone. My son LOVED them. Crabcake was best my mother says she has ever eaten. It certainly is up there. And HUGE - 2 in a dinner. Everything here is done with GREAT care and attention to taste. An attention to delivery would be my SLIGHT snarky issue.....serve the drinks then tell what specials are, then apps, clear, salads/soups, clear, then dinner  - i hate apps and salad plates on table when entrees come (and this is a slight observation because service is amazing and friendly). Bottom line: it's a NOT MISS and I can see why it is so hard to get a table!"}, {"review_id": "v8dIhAvSVswC9UBXOfizJA", "user_id": "ZLvEL2lgecSXWBBsOigBMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "Our first visit.    Spot on service and cuisine.This is an independent restaurant serving up some very tasty dishes.   And it must be a known favorite with the tables all filled and people waiting by 5 pm.A pleasant and unexpected surprise was the chefs offering of a crab salad amuse-bouche that was outstanding.   We had the corn crab chowder for starters.  If it was indeed the cup we ordered vs the bowl, I'd have to say the portion size was large.  The chowder was piping hot and delicious.  On this visit we opted for two of the specials.  The first ($30) was the crab stuffed salmon with a spinach cream sauce.   The second was ($26ish) a drum fillet blackened.   Both were accompanied by ribbons of parsnips, green beans, and carrot; and a choice of asiago mashed potato or steamed white sweet potato.  The sides were a great compliment to the dishes and -prepared expertly.    The salmon dish was rich and filling.   The salmon was perfectly prepared, flaky yet not dried up and over cooked as is so often our experience.    The drum was cooked to a white consistency and easily forked apart. The chef and owner made frequent rounds in the establishment, demonstrating what one can only assume is genuine interest that patrons were getting the full enjoyment from the dishes.Happy hour will be our next venture.  It is applicable at the bar only and includes $2 large shrimps and $4 crab cakes.... we can hardly wait."}, {"review_id": "bhjONmPEsircPkL_5RV3Ww", "user_id": "u8ybdg4OLkRXgkzR42PkSg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/29/2017", "text": "After dining here many times, I can truly say this is a top notch restaurant. The atmosphere is really chilled and I love the bar's light pendant. Speaking of the bar, the drinks are delicious!  There's a couple of TVs on both side of the restaurant but it's streaming some underwater show. The restaurant itself is small. When you walk in you might bump into the first guest table. There's really no foyer to be waiting around to be seated.Ok, so for the food! Every dish I've had was cooked and seasoned just right, and just prepared well. My favorite side is the Hayman potatoes.. it's a white potato that taste like sweet potato when it's at its peak and the owner goes all the way to the Eastern Shores to get it! Every dessert is equally delicious. You can't go wrong in whatever dish you pick. The waitress and the owner is very friendly.

You can't go wrong with anything here, from the drinks to the food, to the bathrooms even! To start, I had a fantastic margarita called the Great White. It was served in a large, water-sized glass and had fantastic flavor in addition to a good amount of tequila. For an appetizer, I ordered a crab cake. Unlike many crab cakes, this one had a large amount of great tasting crab and just a little bit of breading. The sauce on top tasted good, too.The sweet potato biscuits were amazing, along with the apricot butter! Honestly, this biscuits are easily bite sized, so we ordered two more helpings. I ordered the tempura shrimp for my main entree. I should have ordered the half order (3) instead of the full order (6) but I ended up eating everything anyways. The shrimp tasted fantastic. The vegetables and sweet potato that it came with were also great, too. Finally, the bathroom is fantastic.

Something has happened to my go-to spot for crab cakes.  After  years of dependable, quality seafood, last night's visit was a sad shadow of what had always been an outstanding experience.  The service was sub par and had the waitress checked on our meals, the visit might have been salvaged with meals being remade.  As it was, the meal was entirely too salty to eat....like the crab had been harvested from the Dead Sea salty.  The crab cake was mushy, full of filler, dark \"crab\" and had at least three times too much salt. There was narely a crab lump in my cake. You can visibly see the difference in the pics.  They have changed the fish to flounder with their normal combos....sad departure from the Covina they have always had and the second most average fish after tilapia.   The fried oysters, usually two bite sized, were very small...literally quarter sized..but cooked appropriately and not salt ladden.  The potato biscuits were under done. The veggies were also extremely salty. It was a sad meal for $25-27/ plate.  The bright spot was the white sweet potato...it was novel and delicious....but I didnt come to a seafood resturant for a potato.  When they offered a box for my uneaten meal I told them it was unedible...and it was the first time any inquiry was made.  The manager appologized and blamed it on their internet/computer problems.  They made the meal gratis but it doesnt excuse the overall lack luster performance in an establishment that set the bar so high.  The chef owner was not there but with so many changes, my partner and I question if there has been a change of ownership or management. He has never not been there and the service and quality have always been above par. I have eaten there every 4-6 weeks for several years. I am so saddened, I dont have words... next time, if the chef owner isnt there, I will leave as obviously he is the key to everything there."}, {"review_id": "KkQKHMgyvY9lbzhF2KheXw", "user_id": "vc-e0nAz-5WIwNtiUJmm9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "We were at the door at 4 pm and we're very glad to be early.

It's in a strip mall but the reviews were so good we couldn't pass it up. We waited longer than originally told for a table but only because it's a small place. We got seated and ordered a few drinks to start. Pineapple Mojito was delicious. They gave us sweet potato biscuits with apricot butter and they were awesome. We were also served an amuse bouche of crab claws with micro greens and remoulade. Yum! I ordered the crab cakes which were two large broiled crab cakes, a succotash of sorts, and mashed potatoes. The crab cakes were the best of the trip. So good!! They did not skimp on the lump crab meat. Everyone at the table loved their food, service was excellent, and the chef came around to ask us how the food was. How nice! That's always so courteous in my opinion. They could make so much more money if they moved to a bigger space though. I definitely plan on coming back next time I visit VA Beach."}, {"review_id": "xIw-9J64THhk5jPn9Kn30A", "user_id": "g6RNbhrkhxQCaKlsSeuVbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "The seafood was fresh, delicious and expertly prepared.

Finally a gal pal and I made a dinner date to meet up here after work.  She bailed at the last minute and I had been thinking about it for weeks (and all that day) so I came by myself. They were busy at 6pm and had one table by the door or the bar.  I chose the bar so I didn't have to sit by the door and also so I wouldn't be by myself.  I normally make friends at the bar.  I did!  I met some people who live in my neighborhood (Lago Mar) and we spent some time chatting and they gave me their advice on what is good on the menu since they appear to eat here all the time. The bartender was friendly and greeted me pretty quickly for as busy as he was.  I ordered a water and decided to go with the seaside scallops because I love them.  They came with veggies (green beans and carrots) and a white sweet potato.  I know what you're thinking - a white sweet potato?!  Wtf is that?  I know, me too.  But the lady I had made friends with said it was AMAZING and I had to try it.  So I did.  I'm SO glad.  YUM.  Who knew?!  Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly.  I was very happy with my meal. I took my husband home a slice of Key Lime but he didn't love it (he's trying to be healthier anyway). Delicious!  I loved the small-town restaurant feel where most people were locals and the owner comes out to talk to them bc he remembers them.  How charming!  I'll be back.
