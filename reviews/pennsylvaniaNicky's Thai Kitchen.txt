My party of 4 was seated immediately. Pretty attentive service throughout the whole time. Crab Rangoon - Cream cheese was not extremely overwhelming. Perfect balance of crab as they don't skimp on it. This comes in about 8 pieces.Pineapple Fried Rice - Pretty solid with large portions. Once again they are generous with their meat which I appreciate."}, {"review_id": "9saM4dBUlJSHUaqVNfvlLw", "user_id": "mw071rj-CZ7QnIiPzRr1xg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Great Thai food in downtown Pittsburgh.Staff are pretty friendly for sitting patrons.

The service that was provided was great! You can see how well the group worked as a team. Water was constantly filled, dishes were bussed in a timely manner, and going above and beyond our server offered to take the group photo first.Food for me personally could have been more tangy/tart/sour. I like a heavy hand with kaffir like leaf, lemongrass and galanga. We ordered the spicy noodles (tofu), duck curry, green curry (chicken), curry noodles (beef), mussels, Tom Kha (seafood). The family were happy with most of the meal except for the mussels. There were shells but a lot of missing mussels. I wouldn't recommend the mussels or the curry noodles."}, {"review_id": "SfwWEc517mqudd9l7-HL-w", "user_id": "SVI4wBw1gflpCEZu8OEiFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "You need to make a reservation before you come here because it is always packed.

I ordered takeout chicken pad thai, tom yum soup, and crab rangoons. The pad thai was the worst of the bunch. Heavy on the noodles, not enough sauce, making the dish dry.. and the chicken was dry, as well.The tom yum soup wasn't bad, it was actually pretty good.The crab rangoons were very good. The review would have been higher if the entree was great and the appetizer failed, but... this was a flop of a dinner.Also, the woman answering the phone was rushed and a bit rude."}, {"review_id": "5Oi_PJ2hHiR1-GIW1MdUdw", "user_id": "lAf9Fx7BWwqRzpEoTYadJA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Nicky's Thai Kitchen is a beautiful dining experience tucked away in the middle of downtown. I might spend as much time staring at the golden mirrored ornamental designs around me as I do the menu or talking with my friends, which is not to say that the quality of the food is anything less.I am always impressed by their wide selection of curries, noodles, and appetizers. My favorite dish so far is the panang curry - the notes of lime, basil, and cilantro are soothing and comforting, the right mix of sweet and savory, perfect with a side of rice. Their appetizers are delicious as well - I recommend the deep-fried shrimp cakes which go well with the accompanying light cucumber sauce. Just writing this review makes me want to go back when I get the chance to have the same exact thing as last time even though there's so many things on the menu I promise myself I'll try next time."}, {"review_id": "0A_76oL1cSAK3XwZbAGddw", "user_id": "8JvUGKKcTfAmkTBOmUIMzA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "I used to live in Pittsburgh and have been to the original Nicky's Thai in the Northside.  My parents swear that is the best Thai food they've ever had to this day.  While I was in town over the holidays my husband and I had dinner at this location.  It's probably been 8 or 9 years since I've had Nicky's Thai and honestly I was a little disappointed with it.  The décor and the atmosphere was nice and the food was tasty but non memorable.  The drink selection was really poor with the exception of Chang beer which is what I drank the whole time I was in Thailand a few months ago.  What turned me off the most was that the portions were absolutely ginormous, and the entrees were expensive for Thai food.  If they didn't serve enough food for 3 people in an entrée they could lower the prices to something more reasonable.  I split an appetizer and an entrée with my husband and it was more than enough food.  Maybe the original is still better but I wouldn't rush back to this location."}, {"review_id": "py0y8FWBqFgj_Q-A8KRqLA", "user_id": "WieEJJhp-mofgqPXCB3fzg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "This place has a beautiful interior and a quick-to-help staff; however, the food is not very consistent.

We made reservations but were a bit late because of traffic and luckily they were super nice about it and weren't busy so we were able to be seated. I got the Thai tea ($2.50) and it was SUPER good. I thought it was very well done I drank mines super fast! We ordered the Panang and pad see eaw. We got them 5/5 spicy. I didn't think it was actually 5/5 spiciness. The Panang was solid and super yummy, but the pad see eaw was super disappointing. To make it spicier, they literally drenched it in red chili flakes. It gave it a super weird texture that wasn't even spicy, so I didn't really enjoy it. I feel like the underlying flavor is super good, but when it is drenched in red chili flakes, it tasted really odd. The Panang comes with rice, and it filled like half of the bowl it came in. There wasn't a good Panang to rice ratio so we ordered more rice and it was $3!!! I thought that was kind of crazy, it was more expensive than the drink! Also, the extra rice is a lot of rice, so I wish that the rice that came with the Panang actually filled the bowl so you didn't have to order $3 rice."}, {"review_id": "cjwcWunX6Ajob64CSLNd_g", "user_id": "fh0b0oyW6NVvN4JjviDOMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "We were seated quickly and served quickly! We went for lunch very near to opening and it did get quite busy.I had the spicy noodle (I think one spice away from the spiciest?) and it was great! Glad I did not get it any hotter. The noodles are thick and delicious, I could bathe in them all day. The serving size is enormous, to be expected, I could not finish, but they gladly wrapped it up so I could take it home.Service I will mention again, is very efficient, which I enjoyed.

She had heard really good things about this places and so she dragged me along. They close from 4-5 just FYI in between the end of lunch and to prep for the beginning of dinner. So we had to walk around downtown a bit but I would say that the wait was definitely worth it! We got an appetizer of egg rolls which were pretty good and flavorful even without the sauce. And she got green curry and I got red curry! The serving sizes were pretty decent but I didn't like how they gave us a bigger bowl of rice to share, rather than our own individual bowls. But the curry themselves were super delicious and the rice was perfectly cooked.The service was weird but oddly really attentive. Like even if I took a sip of my drink, they'd come to refill it right away, which I'm not complaining about. That was nice. But the waiter who took our order and the waiter who refilled our drinks and the waiter who took our plates away, were all different people so I didn't really know where my tip was going. . . or who I was supposed to ask when we needed something. But I mean we were taken care of, so I guess that's what's important.This place is a little pricey, but then again it's downtown and it was for dinner. So that's somewhat expected. I would definitely come here again."}, {"review_id": "6BBwScos1IPUxl6lP6ekXw", "user_id": "h4MPk8UK1OwhFlWECVw7SQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Some of the best Thai food in Pittsburgh can be found at Nicky's Thai Kitchen. Upon entering, you're transported to another world - the interior is lavishly decorated with golden statues and other cultural decorations. During several visits, service has always been exceptional and prompt, and the food is always absolutely delicious. Some notable dishes that I've had are the Sen Mee Pad See Ew, Thai Basil Chicken (note that the entrees don't come with a side order of rice), Drunken Noodles, and the Crab Fried Rice. Their appetizers are exceptional as well. This one time they had Thai style chicken wings that I still dream about to this very day.

All the food here is amazing. Recently I went and ordered the spicy peanut stir fry entree! It was delicious as usual! I got a 3 out of 5 spiciness level and that was perfect for my taste buds. My only minor complaint would be is that the chicken could be softer. It was a little bit hard but nonetheless still very good.I would recommend calling ahead for a reservation as it can be packed especially on a weekend.Service is mediocre, I have had experience where it was very good and experience where it wasn't that great but it really depends on how packed the restaurant goes.I would highly recommend Nicky's for Thai out of all Thai restaurants."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/nickys-thai-kitchen-pittsburgh-4?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
