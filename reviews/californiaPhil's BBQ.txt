Maybe it's my experience with BBQ... I don't know. Here's what I got:Quarter rib plate with slaw and fries. I added a beef bone and pulled pork. Before I get to it all, as I said in my tip, I was hesitant when I found out a couple of things: they do not have brisket; they only have one sauce.Anyway, the rib bone was really tasty. That was my favorite. If you come here, get one. The ribs and pulled pork were good enough, but they taste wood cooked, not smoked. The slaw was good, but the fries did not taste fresh. Three employees told me that the fries were fresh cut and fresh. I don't know about that. If so, something is wrong. I've eaten enough fresh cut fries to know that these were not there. The one sauce was not my cup of tea. It's sweet with a bit of pepper, but not my type of sauce. I like KC style on NC sauces. This is not that. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I'll say that for sure!"}, {"review_id": "Ar4npr3qCcv1ZzsqudPhNQ", "user_id": "wcQ_c6NvMmvplHUDor28zg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I'm not necessarily a BBQ snob but I've lived in Texas and have had some damn good BBQ. I'll say Phil's deff lives up to the hype. Came here on a Monday night with a colleague of mine while in town for a symposium. I heard so much about the long wait but luckily we were able to order under less than 20 mins. Score! I got half a pound of baby back ribs, a side order of sausage links, and corn on a cob. My colleague ordered baby back ribs, pulled pork, and veggies. The baby back ribs were fall off the born tender. Wow! So good! It had this unique smoke flavor that's remarkable. The sausage link was absolutely delish. And so was the corn on the cob. Nom nom! I tried my colleague's pulled pork which was very good, too. My meal was so satisfying that I finished it all. I was certainly not lady like devouring all the meat but who cares! I was careful enough not to ruin my favorite shirt tho. They got plenty of napkins and those wet wipes! Service was friendly and attentive. I even met the owner Phil and saw him serving customers himself! This is indeed some damn good BBQ that's totally worth my money.

They certainly do their best to ensure you have the best experience you can. They even have signs saying that if anything is wrong with your meal, you can just tell them and they'll make it right. Oh, and the food is phenomenal too.I went on a Saturday afternoon with a group of 6. The line to order, which is usually quite long, only took about 30 minutes. After ordering 5 beef ribs, a half rack of pork ribs, and the macaroni salad, the estimated wait time for the food was about 20 minutes (yeah, there's a lot of waiting). Unfortunately, something happened with their computer system, and we ended up waiting about 40 minutes before asking them what was going on. They were quickly on it, and we got our food almost immediately after, along with some gift cards and some of their signature BBQ sauce and dry rub (which I am happily using now).The barbeque itself was tender, juicy, and abundant. Although it may seem a little pricey, the portions and quality definitely justify the cost. There was a little more char than I personally like, but the deep flavors from the smoking balanced it out quite well. I preferred the beef ribs over the pork ribs not only for the beastly aesthetic of weilding an enormous hunk  of meat in each hand, but also for the yumminess. The macaroni salad was also excellent, and I would recommend it as one of the most delicious \"palate cleansers\" you'll ever have. Would definitely go again!"}, {"review_id": "ZFbRhdVGfeQyBJ8z1lRjJA", "user_id": "vF4kLTg3W9dO4tSdXLWMLw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "We ate here in the past on vacation and my husband remembered it fondly.

I've been here a total of 3 time now and every time it was a good experience. Food is always freshly made and when I dig in, I can taste the quality of the meat. It's never dry and over cooked! Lots of flavoring in their BBQ sauce so a little bit goes a long way~ they give you a little cup of it with your food so you are able to dip your meat in if needed.Today, it took FOREVER for us to receive our food. First, the waitress who took our order up front got it wrong. So we had to go back in, and the manager had to cancel it then reorder everything. So that made it take longer than it was supposed to.. We got the situation all figured out, thanks to our server who was sectioned in the patio area. I honestly feel like Phil's is very overhyped. Yes, the food is good but is it THAT good..? I don't think so. The first couple bites is pure bliss because of how hungry you are but after, you kind of get sick of it. Just my honest opinion. Even if portions are pretty good for 1 person, we weren't able to finish our food. They also have hand washing areas and to-go stations, which are very convenient!I know the lines and wait can get pretty long but luckily we only waited about 15 minutes.

Too bad it didn't come with bread rolls but I managed to finish my food. To drink they had Coke products which is a plus to me. I drank raspberry iced tea this time. So good! After we were done eating, the lady came by and cleared our table immediately. That was very efficient. I definitely like the friendliness of the staff here. One of the ladies even gave us to go cups which is what I'm not used to. That was definitely cool of her. Only negative here would be parking and the long wait at certain times.

The BBQ ribs may be the star item here, but we were craving chicken so for a first visit decided to get pollo to go. With carry out, especially on a slow weekday afternoon, the expectation was that I'd be in and out in a jiffy since I'd already called in my order and had folks waiting in the car. When I arrived, there was no line at all. The cashier was very nice, found my order in system and rang me up right away. However, I had to wait about 15 min to receive my 2 white meat BBQ chicken halves and a small side of rings, which is not ideal given that 1) the order was small and straightforward  2) there was no line and 3) supposedly they have everything ready and just need to bag it up when you get there. The guys cooking in the back were just joking around and in no rush to help the cashier expedite even though she tried multiple times to get them to hurry up. Once I had the food in hand, the onion rings tower did not disappoint--the rings are huge, crispy and delightfully savory due to the spiced beer batter. Would have been great to have more ranch dressing in which to drench them. The BBQ aroma from the chicken was appetizing, but the chicken itself was disappointingly dry in the middle.  I get that ribs are the focus, but hope Phils can work on rounding out carry out service and chicken cookery consistency."}, {"review_id": "n2Yd2oKekgMGtn8HWdpz_w", "user_id": "zvQ7B3KZuFOX7pYLsOxhpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "San Diego's #1 Most Reviewed Business on Yelp! D'awww how frickin cute! I wrote a Yelp review 5 years ago back in 2013 while I was still in college. I wasn't really a yelper at the time but it's fun to look back at old reviews. It's time for an update!After living in San Diego for 7 years now I've been to Phil's BBQ maybe 5 times or less. It's delicious but the intimidating lines keeps me from making this a regular stop.I honestly hadn't been to Phil's maybe since 2014. I recently visited again last week since my sister and brother-in-law were visiting from out of town. It was my bro-in-law's first time in San Diego so I just had to take them here for dinner!I took them here on a weeknight in hopes that the line would be shorter and it was!!!! We came last Wednesday evening around 8:30pm and there was no wait at all and plenty of tables! If you're visiting from out of town I would highly recommend coming here on a weekday or weeknight to avoid long lines.The three of us shared the full rack of ribs (12 ribs) and we got two large sides of sweet beans! It was just the right amount for all of us!The service is great at Phil's! They have self-serve drinks, utensils, bibs, plates etc. It's definitely a casual place. We did't get to try the bar this time around but I saw they have a bar in one of their rooms!Now that I know the secret to avoiding long lines I'll try to come here more often!!"}, {"review_id": "xeUd7-eWlK96KVqiLbJ2LA", "user_id": "aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I had the Phil's Sausage Sandwich and this was something else.I wish I had tried other meats as then I would be able to gauge this place honestly but the link was coated and cooked in their bbq sauce that made it like a thick bbq caramel glaze on it that was a texture I had not had before."}, {"review_id": "zlA8OUsBiH_5b2v9F6huCw", "user_id": "amKuvJtW35lBe0o265H62A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Visit: Wednesday, March 28, 2018I love to bag on Phil's BBQ because I resent being made to wait in their line by my friends every time I visit San Diego. I'm finally glad I had an experience that I can't really complain about.We arrived pretty late, at 8 pm. The line wasn't as long as it's been in the past, and we waited for maybe 45 minutes. Naturally, we were starving, so we shared a full baby back rib dinner and a full beef rib dinner, with macaroni salad, fries, and corn on the cob on the side. We also ordered cole slaw and a sausage link. Just in case we didn't have enough food lol. My main complain in the past has been that their sauce is way too sweet, so I always ask for it on the side. I have to report that everything we ate was delicious. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the sauce seemed less overpowering this time. The beef ribs were massive, and we barely finished half of that. The sides were all very tasty as well. The sausage was a bit on the greasy side, however. The staff was super friendly. The bussers were very attentive and made an effort to help us with whatever we needed. One thing I'd note is that the cutlery wasn't very clean and still had some grease on it. Pretty gross, but nothing that can't be easily remedied. I think I'm finally ready to say that I like Phil's and that it's almost worth the wait. I still don't think I'd decide to eat if here given the choice, but I'd be more than happy to tag along if somebody else wants to come. For the amount of food you get, the prices are very reasonable, too.

After waiting in line for approximately 35 minutes, I placed an order for a half rack of baby back ribs with fries and sweet baked beans as my sides. You order at a counter and seat yourself afterwards, but there's a waitstaff who come to your table every now and then to make sure you're having a great dining experience. Let's talk about the food here. The ribs are smothered in a sticky, tangy, mildly spicy, lightly sweet sauce that will have you licking your fingers. The meat was very tender and fell off the bone with ease as I sank my teeth into the succulent goodness. There was a light char on the exterior that added a nice crispy texture around the edges. The fries were mediocre, but they give you a heaping pile of them even though it's considered a \"small side\". The sweet baked beans were peppery which balanced the sweetness very well. I usually don't like beans, but I really enjoyed these. Everything is so efficient here. They have the menu blown up and displayed outside where the line usually extends to and beyond, as well as inside the restaurant before you reach the counter. That way, everyone already knows what they want by the time they reach the counter and there's no holding up the line. There's a hand washing station and an area where you can grab to go boxes as well. They also have signs everywhere reminding their patrons to alert a staff member immediately if there's anything wrong, which really goes to show how much they value customer satisfaction."}, {"review_id": "ZKrbUeDZTxbE-AqDhBAc3w", "user_id": "fN-hqdLsiLwHccNEjwVq0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "There is always a line here during popular eating hours, but it is WORTH THE WAIT!
