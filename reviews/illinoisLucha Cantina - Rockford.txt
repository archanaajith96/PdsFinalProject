Our group of 40 loved the food and said they would never go back to cold cut sandwiches. If you are having a party or dinner meeting and need someone to cater, I highly recommend Lucha Cantina.You will look like a genius."}, {"review_id": "TNcIidHH5tazG_8V-mAbmw", "user_id": "g3axyateHGPk3ahBzyZ2ug", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "So - still trying to figure this place out. Let me start by saying that my tacos - as a discrete element - were fantastic. Generous with the filling, flavorful, all around great. I had the carne asada and was beyond impressed with the execution. Also deserving of praise - the salsas, I had the smoky red one and the cucumber tomatillo one, really, really good. Expectations exceeded, there.For the rest, though, the experience was uneven overall. I ate at Lucha as part of a large group (14-ish), which always colors the experience slightly, so I will focus on the areas that seemed most off regardless of the size of party. 1. The service was excruciatingly slow from the moment we arrived. So much so that we were taking bets on when we would actually leave the restaurant. We arrived at 6:30 on a Tuesday and were seated immediately in a large room - which tells me they knew we were a big group (I was not in charge of logistics). However, we did not get waters or have drink orders taken until almost 7pm. We got our chips and salsa at 7:15, and finally had our dinner orders taken at 7:30. The restaurant did not otherwise appear to be busy, so I am not sure where the problem was.2. The menu is diverse, but in an unfocused way that made me nervous about how good the execution could be. The menu features both \"typical\" Mexican fare, but also a quinoa bowl, a salmon salad, mac and cheese and a burger featuring PB+J. The impression is that it's a Mexican restaurant, but also whatever random idea occurs to the manager. Odd.3. There are NO CHANGES ALLOWED. Unlike most Mexican restaurants, there is no a la carte menu where you can pick a few different small things. So, choose wisely because if you ask to combine taco options, you will receive only a \"no\". No context, just \"no\".4. Prepare for what I consider to be extremely petty upcharges. Want the gluten free tortillas? 15 cents apiece. Sour Cream? 30 cents. Guac? 30 cents. What even is that? I have never seen a pricing structure like that, ever. You can quickly add dollars to your order, just by requesting condiments. The menu prices are decent as they stand, just beware that any personal preference will cost you.5. Drink menu is robust, but drinks themselves contain little to no detectable alcohol. 6 bucks for a class of ginger beer and ice with a vaguely rum flavor is ok, I guess. Companions also named the mojitos and margaritas as weak. Not terrible, not great. 3 stars."}, {"review_id": "MoPdpbdBSAtCCnotxyd3zA", "user_id": "_tHSAp8CgI14if0rnD2aHw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "So-so Mexican.  Portions are generous, perhaps overly so, but the flavors are bland.  The salsas and guac are adequate, as are the chips.

Being recently vegan (3 weeks) there are always options and small accommodations that any restaurant should be able to make BUT they didn't need to make any because they had vegan options!!!   Big plus but I think it missed the mark on taste.   Always starting with a cocktail is a must n it's a good thing their strawberry bourbon mule was vegan!!  ;)           I had 2!!  Complementary chips n salsa was delish!  Guac app was super good!  Nice n chunky with  jalapeños but not too spicy that the kids couldn't eat it.  Their hummus was absolutely the best I've ever had!!!   We also ordered their  house made tator tots n they said they were good.  I didn't have any because they had cheese in it.  Looked amazing tho. I ordered their vegan burrito with no vegan cheese because I didn't like the brand they had.  It was disappointing.  Filled with a ton of rice (80% of it was rice), beans, onions, kale n broccoli.  Served with a side of rice n beans.  It was strange.  I was expecting onions mushrooms n bell peppers at least like a fajita wrapped like a burrito but that was not the case.  Big miss here.  Also tried the vegan quesadilla which I thought was better but it had the vegan chz which I don't like.  Nice balance of veggies (same veggies as my burrito minus all the rice n beans) Our server was great.  Dry humor that only a few would get but def accommodated when he could to our vegan needs."}, {"review_id": "YPA6WUyC4BePTx-HUAB0WA", "user_id": "v951oA4pGYQOrPhZEKuZsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "Hello, how are you today? Are you in Rockford and would like a great meal or some cocktails? Then please find your way to Lucha Cantina Rockford, with locations in Vail, Breckinridge and...here?Thank goodness. Keep in mind that they don't do authentic Mexican street food. No, it's kind of a Ski resort meets Mexico fusion. For example, their red and green salsas are not authentic, they are better than authentic. So are their rellenos. Do you like a good salad? No greazy ground meat salads here. Everything is fresh, made carefully to be as healthy as possible while still being flavorful and fun.I haven't been to Barcelona but Lucha has some of the best sangria I've had. The best thing though at Lucha is the friendly server attitude. I love it here.I think 'lucha' means 'fight' which to me nicely represents the place. It's kind of meaningless but still badass.

I had the meatloaf sandwich previously and it supposed to be known as a a favorite at there other location RKFD but from trying the sandwich, it wasn't all that great. The sandwich was a dry piece of meatloaf between bread and cheese. Most recently I went here because a friend wanted to go. We tried the tacos and the enchiladas. I was actually impressed this time with what I chose to eat. I do enjoy the salsas. They have a great variety and there drinks are really good. Overall, I don't recommend the meatloaf sandwich.

The food was mediocre. Not great but also not bad. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas and didn't love the tortillas as they were quite dry.

The poblano pineapple is soooo good. Queso Is also great! Veg options leave much to be desired unfortunately.
