This time we had the time to stop in since we were 5 min away at a dental appointment with my dentist in Fairfield (who by the way everyone should use as he is the BEST!!!! HANDS DOWN-Dr. Cuevas).We arrived early in the day, not too busy and were greeted by Luke, he couldn't possibly be nicer. I was happy he was there, not only he made us feel welcome, but since this was our first time he also explained the menu to us. I enjoy having a beer and told Luke what I normally drink, and asked him to pick for me as I really don't know much about beers. Luke nailed it! They were so good, and to my surprise the pineapple cider was my favorite. Brewport serves pizza, salads, beers, and drinks. I ordered a veggie pizza and my daughter had a cheese pizza, the crust was perfect and flavors were all good. You can have an individual or a large pie, they have thin crust which I like. The brewery is rustic, industrial and hip, but pretty. I will consider stopping here in the future, and I hope Luke will be working because he made this a positive experience.

Even with St Patrick's Day crowds and an event at the arena. Thank you Brewport!!I was intending to try different beers but enjoyed the Dr Porter's Stout so much I stuck with it for the evening. I tried a few different pizzas - white with spinach and mushroom, the brewmaster, and plain mozz - all great. Loved the thin crust and the delicious sauce.

We came in on a quiet winter day. The place was about half full, not too noisy. We ordered some pizza, and started to sample the beers.The interior of this place is really nice, wood and steel aesthetic. There are some nice murals, and a great little nook of memorabilia and brewing ephemera, highlighting some of the historical brands of Bridgeport. The beer is fresh, and interesting, and tasty. I had a couple of different selections, including one of their historical recreations. Lee stuck with one of the IPAs, which was also very tasty.The pizza was great! It's the nice, thin crust New Haven style, which I've grown to love since moving to Connecticut. It comes in little fingerlike pieces, which ... is sometimes awkward to eat, but we made do.I really enjoyed everything about this place, and we'll definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "Qw-Vtsf5Z6G6MepNcTPYLw", "user_id": "sBgR7lRY09Ddmv2I7e9hqA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "Walking up to brewport, the place is... impressive.It's large, it's striking, its factory feel and warehouse industrial atmosphere is current af and who doesn't love brick and reclaimed wood?It's a massive place, big brewery-big beer list, small pizza list but big flavors.I really enjoyed this spot and being so close to the ferry was a big bonus for us Long Island folks.

My Italian brother in law (actual Italian, not a guy from West Haven with a diamond earring and a Sopranos poster in his living room (hi uncle Joe!)) describes this type of pizza as \"so thin it doesn't fill you up.\"  I think is a compliment.. Italian people tend to express things more abstractly than native English speakers. But he's Italian so obviously he knows pizza - even if he is lactose and gluten intolerant AND allergic to tomatoes. The beers don't really do it for me. There are a lot of great ct beers.

They also have really kind managers and waitresses that put on a puppet show by request if you say the secret password, 'TARA.M-Is-A-Backhoe\"; BUT! They only do it if your 2-year-old asks.

I started visiting my wife's family on Long Island NY nearly 10 years ago! When we started going, her cousins were little girls between the ages of 11-14, and the only things we could relate on were video games and cartoons! Back then, the prospect of sitting around a table sharing drinks seemed so distant, and when it finally happened this year, I felt like I was in a time machine or something. They'd moved from NY to CT (Trumbull to be specific) and I wanted to get out of the house before the holidays hit full swing. So I searched the trusty Yelp app and found Brewport. It looked cool, urban, and real laid back, and they offered both beer and cocktails. SCORE! Brewport is in Bridgeport, under a traffic bridge, on the way to the Ferry back to LI. The side of the building has a big mural of a lighthouse, nicely done in hipster fashion, that leads in to detail on the brewing process. Essentially it looks like a big ol' warehouse that they converted into a brewery, which I'm sure is what happened! Walking in you hit a gift shop and host stand which leads into a large open room (I'm guessing used for bigger private parties) and the main bar/dining room. The bar area houses the brewing equipment, and there are large roll up doors to a patio and a few other private party rooms in the back. But perhaps the coolest feature of this bar is the two story seating they offer! Yep. They've got a row of big booths beneath an INDOOR second story level of seating too. They also have high tops and bar seating too!Most of the crew ordered beer flights ($14 or so) which come with four hefty 7oz pours. IMHO none of the beer was world class, but it certainly wasn't bad. The menu has a lot of great descriptions and tasting notes of their beers, which makes the experience that much more fun. The dunkelweiss was the favorite by far, and it said it tasted of banana, and that was so true! They also have cocktails on the menu too! I ordered a riff on the boulevardier, with campari and rye, and really enjoyed it. If you're into bitter flavors, this is a great choice. My cousin grabbed the Mai TaIPA, a beer cocktail riff on the classic Mai Tai, which was also great. Most breweries wouldn't go this far with their cocktails, so I really applaud the effort here. The only miss was the \"Old Fashioned\". The menu mentioned root beer being in the drink, and I figured it may have a splash, but this was basically a mug of root beer and I had to send it back. You put those two words on a cocktail menu and it conjures up something specific, and this was SO FAR FROM IT. Lets face it, alcohol can either make the holidays a lot more entertaining or, in some cases, just plain bearable. In my case, I was looking for a way to amp up the fun factor, and that's exactly what we found at Brewport. It just may become an annual tradition!"}, {"review_id": "3kX1LAerWSkVLr26exzyQg", "user_id": "w53ShjiDGQzbX-wmUG_jJA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/19/2017", "text": "Great place to stop before a Bluefish game. Brewport is a spacious brewery with ample parking (if you arrive on weekends before 5pm), decent beer, and OK pizza. I ordered a flight (loved the South End Pale Ale) and a Brew Master pizza. (Note: The Small pizza is ~14\" and the Large pizza is ~16\", so it's never worth it to get a Large if you're a party of two. Better to just get two Smalls and have a decent amount of pizza leftover for the next day.) Also, I'm not a fan of greasy thin-crust pizza that's cut into squares, so I didn't particularly enjoy my meal, but my flight, La Fin Du Monde beer, and Disco Paloma cocktail were delightful. I also spent an hour in their game room (jumbo Jenga, checkers, chess, and Connect Four) which was filled with energetic kids and their parents. Ultimately, I think Brewport's space would be better suited for 20-30 somethings, and should move away from being the \"family-friendly\" brewery that it is now. (Note: SHOTS ARE NOT ALLOWED, for the purpose of keeping the environment casual, but I think it would definitely bring in more traction if they turned up the music and let the liquor flow.)"}, {"review_id": "A4p00uUMwvgAGYGvEmapKA", "user_id": "W6nMsnSkXCuUsfq4ve_syg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "Brewport is a spot I have had on my radar for awhile now and just recently made a visit while passing through town to grab some beers with my fiancé.  It was pouring rain when we came so it was pretty busy, but we grabbed two spots at the bar.  Brewport has a cool industrial feel, high ceilings, garage doors, brick walls and a great open kitchen were you can see them popping in delicious thin crust pizzas.Brewport offers a selection of their our brews as well as a few guest taps to choose from.  I got a sampler (4) of some of their current offerings.  They offered a good variety of styles (IPAs, Porter, etc.) I thought the session IPA was the best that I tried, perfectly balanced and full of flavor.  We weren't planning on getting food but once we saw those pizzas we had to grab one to share.  You can pick form their list of speciality pizzas, or make your own (red or white sauce base and choice of toppings).  The red sauce full of veggies was excellent.  This crust is to die for, perfectly crisp and the sauce was amazing.  Service was great and there was a nice variety of people here (families, kids, middle-aged, etc).  My only issue was there is no TVs... It was college football saturday and this place would have been somewhere we stayed longer if we could watch our games for the day!
