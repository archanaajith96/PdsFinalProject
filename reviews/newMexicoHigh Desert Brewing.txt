It was so bad we were thinking of leaving but we just walked a mile to get here so we decided to tough it out.I had the chipotle chicken burger which had good flavor but the chicken was kind of dry and stringy and the bbq sauce overpowered the chipotle sauce. The green chile cheese fries were great but a little too spicy for me. My friend had the mushroom burger which was pretty good apparently. They had a decent alcohol selection. I don't think we'll be back though."}, {"review_id": "bqd--rf71Ho9iQy2tJEwCA", "user_id": "ixBigHmSphGD4pPw8tYCyw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "I was pretty disappointed with the ambience here. The menu made me think it'd be a modern, airy place... what it ended up being was a small dark dive bar with broken and torn booths.The food, however, was pretty good. My starving hiking group enjoyed the quesadilla ($7), green chile cheeseburger ($8), green chile cheese chicken sandwich ($8ish) and green chile fries ($6) for lunch. The chile was HOT! The beer left something to be desired."}, {"review_id": "ffZ1h4gqpNP0noht3UgcHg", "user_id": "ch3cugiBsKq8gVCVFPT8Dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Great food at a cheap price.

We had 3 different beers which were all excellent - the Irish Red Ale, the Brown Ale and the Belgian Pilsner. We each had a burger - 2 with fries and 1 with sweet potato fries. Burgers were delicious and the sweet potato fries were some of the best we've had. Would definitely recommend this place. If we lived in that area, we would be regulars.

We stopped by on a road trip.Make sure you check the prices and menu before you go so that you can estimate what the place is likely to be like.  But, as long as you're cool with it... its a friendly, very laid back place.  The food was better than I expected.My husband is a microbrew beer snob but he raved about the Octoberfest here.  He doesn't rave about much, he's a grouch so it must be good.  I'm not into beer myself so I can only pass the information on third party."}, {"review_id": "KeJfIqfqJTdvLbqPv6vYQA", "user_id": "bhstwMI-j7XMO9lyLIXMwg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "8/25/2017", "text": "Sticky rings from previous beer glasses on every table, flies everywhere, hot inside.

Have lived here for many many years and finally found the time to swing by here after hearing moderately good reviews on the green chili cheeseburger and nachos. All of us in our party took the recommendations of the host and got the green chili cheeseburger. The food wasn't bad but there are countless other restaurants in town like The Game where you will get a green chili cheeseburger that is second to none.There were plenty of tables available so we sat down immediately however, it took at least 10 minutes before anybody even acknowledged us in the restaurant. The food came out relatively quick however the Green chili cheeseburger was definitely not what I expected it was lacking flavor, appearance, and the fries were soggy and not tasty at all.I know this is a bar so you're going to have the odor of alcohol but when I say it was overwhelming, it was like they have not cleaned the restaurant or the restrooms in months. A previous reviewer referenced it like a frat house and I couldn't have said it any better.I do not drink, so I did not have any of the beer they have available so I cannot rate them on that aspect. With all of the restaurants here in town with quality food I cannot recommend going here for any reason whatsoever and will not return. Others may have a different opinion when combining beer and nachos however my experience left me with no desire to return.Service: B-Atmosphere: CFood: B-"}, {"review_id": "iGxbpdfIKgSMEhMKqVBN_g", "user_id": "_uxVmvGjeLiepqZDI25toA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "Stopped in for a pint and some food after seeing White Sands National Monument.
