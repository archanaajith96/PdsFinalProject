To my surprise, you up go to the register and order instead of having a server. The staff is very friendly and guides first timers if they are confused on the ordering process. Xoco has a variety of happy hour specials ranging from margaritas, tacos, appetizers, and build your own guacamole. Happy hour runs Tuesday-Friday 3-6pmWe had the happy hour margaritas, happy hour build you own guac (we added tomatoes, and spicy roasted poblano), chicken tinga tacos (4) tacos total), the tacos de papas, and the baja chicken sandwich. The food was amazing and the highlight of this lunch was definitely the sandwich, since the sandwiches are made in a wood burning oven the bread is phenomenal."}, {"review_id": "nAlCqkPxYIWPmNbPlnR8vQ", "user_id": "-6v_LFbfmSbIx2ZSnVtixQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "This place is awesome. Rick Bayless does authentic Mexican street food. Great food, ambience kind of sucks. But staff is nice and food is so good I don't care.

I was quite disappointed after I tried the popular Ahogado. The sandwich was dunked in a tomato spicy soup. I asked for mild but their mild was more like medium. It was pretty spicy. The bread was good but I would have preferred the bread not to be dipped in a bowl of tomato soup. The flavor of the carnitas was good. My bf has the Pepito. It was pretty good. The carmelized onions were really good. It kind of reminded me of a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. I liked his sandwich more than mine. He thought mine had more flavor. The one thing I was looking forward to were the Churros. Pistachio glazed churro wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Looked good but the glaze tasted artificial. We had chocolate peanut churro as well and this one actually tasted better than the Pistachio but it wasn't amazing either. Overall the food was decent and reasonably priced and service was good. I would probably come back to try other stuff."}, {"review_id": "aJIwGi7ZrKlFAoNNn0btDg", "user_id": "XvDCc88bf48VumWuVchl0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I recently discovered the Sat morning breakfast avocado toast.

I especially liked the Fully Loaded Guacamole for its freshness and rich flavors. I also liked the Tlayuda, a large thin fried tortilla topped with bean paste, avocado and other good stuff. The Ahogada, which is one of their signature dishes, is a sandwich that is partially dipped in soup.

As we were in line, a host came around with tlayuda for everyone in line to sample. YUM. We were also able to order drinks as we waited. I ordered a limonada, very authentic and fresh! I was pleasantly surprised.I loved all I ordered and would highly recommend all: Carnitas tacos, torta de milanesa de pollo, Churros, Guacamole with all the toppings. I can't wait to visit again and try out the other dishes.Very casual restaurant with great food and customer service.

Due to the small space this restaurant has, you have you order first and they seat you based on your party size. It is pretty standard method of seating. I have no complaints because everything was seamless and smooth (during prime lunch time, too!). I had the Pepito Torta! The bread was crispy, but not too tough and the filling was pretty good. The green sauce it comes with was absolutely mandatory to help cut the heavy caramelized onions. Unfortunately, I am a believer that food served should always been good without the sauce. The accompaniment sauce should only enhance a meal; not make or break the dish.Overall, it wasn't mind-blowing. It is everything a SoCal girl expected in Mexican inspired-food in the Midwest. I knocked 1 star off because the taste was a 4/5 and the price did not help. If it was a few dollars cheaper, then this establishment would have definitely gotten another 5 stars."}, {"review_id": "jHzElLpI6RGqTk0s_UVBhg", "user_id": "jyD0PR9TueJMca0xCgwFfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Churros.

I have completely given up on this place. I guess in the past four years, I forgot what a disaster it is to pick up food and how \"just OK\" their posole is. I'm going to order some damn chiles and make it my damn self. Is that enough damns? This is the mood I meant every time I try to pick up food at this place.Picking up an order here is a complete clusterfuck, just too much activity, no streamlined process, no set person to check in with, and your food may be sitting there getting cold while they pack orders for Caviar or other takeout services. Happened again today, and when I commented on it and felt my relatively cold container, they tried to tell me it just came out. No it didn't, cuz I just stood there and watched you. I ordered an item you literally have to scoop into a container, and it's not like they started cooking at when I ordered. Maybe they intend for all their food to be reheated in the microwave, but that is not what I am trying to do with a takeout container. I'm trying to walk a couple of blocks and get it to my house and just eat it all right. Â They have a decent food product, but they really need to work on their online ordering and pickup process. Right now, it's more disorganized than a Chicago government institution. To top it off, the posole was very salty but not very flavorful. Coming here is just an unpleasant experience but I don't think I will repeat. Is it crazy that their O'Hare locations are much more efficient??"}, {"review_id": "NuVTdZ1LMS78NnDtErzt1A", "user_id": "pk6UlPAJiw0-0s7zvX4TZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "One of my favorite lunch stops. I had had the Ahogada twice and it was just amazing. The pork sandwich is excellent but the spicy tomato broth is the real deal. I got my broth spicy this time and I would compare the Ahogada to an awesome pork panini with a spicy tomato soup.

I went again on a Wednesday night at 6:30 pm and I was the second in line to order. So - if you really want to try Xoco, come during the week, not on the weekend. Service was quick and the cashier and the host were both nice and friendly. I tried their chips and salsa (good, no complaints) and the ahogada which is a pork carnitas sandwich served in a tomato broth. A sandwich..in a tomato broth? That's right, that's what I said. I was a bit skeptical at first because I don't exactly like..soggy bread (who does?). Anyway, it actually worked. Being able to dip the sandwich into the broth made the eating experience more fun. The flavors were really good and I'd actually highly recommend this sandwich. I also had their Mexico City thick hot chocolate - $4 for 8 oz which is expensive. It was a pretty thick hot chocolate (yes I know it's in the name)..it was interesting and would not get again.

It's pronounced sho-co (don't worry, I asked ;) ) and they have everything you need and more for such a lil' place: tortas, soups, tacos, hot chocolate (the serious kind), churros, a guac bar and even shared breakfasts to-go. I've been twice for the happy hour and they have some pretty dope food and drink deals. You can get palomitas (popcorn), dollar fifty chorizo tacos, five dolla margs and $3 beers! Perf place to meet up with friends after work for some cheap yumyums. I've had the pleasure of trying two of their most popular tortas- the ahogada and the woodland mushroom. The former is a pork sandwich in a bowl of soupy red sauce. It's a little bit spicy but nothing over the top! Since that torta got kinda soggy, my preferred one was the mushroom. QUALITY veggies with chipotle garlic mojo, goat cheese, black beans, arugula and 3-chile salsa. So unique. So decadent. Must eat again. The dealio is that you walk in, get a table number, order at the register, sit down & they bring you your order. There's a stretch of trendy restaurants on this part of Clark Street, and I'd definitely recommend Xoco for a quicker meal that's sure-to-please."}, {"review_id": "jeaziBSDYUzMNsEpcUT8Tg", "user_id": "fe-NbubsPUo6Y9NQQibF5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Loved the cubana sandwich! I was afraid it would be too greasy but the sandwich stayed in tact and held the grease in. It was a perfect blend of salty and creamy. Came back another day and tried the churro sundae with a friend and while it was tasty, I probably won't bother getting it again. The sundae is Mexican vanilla flavored ice cream (tasted like horchara to me) with churros, sprinkled with bacon caramel popcorn. The bacon caramel popcorn had the actual bacon flavor and texture, as if little bacon pieces were actually on the popcorn!I'd love to come back to try more of the sandwiches!"}, {"review_id": "dWv52r_rD1cGWWagPNwgXw", "user_id": "MKTrPMPWriQuc5GkuYpFcQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "My friend was really wanting to eat at a Rick Bayless restaurant so we decided to go here before a night of going out. At around 6 on black Friday. It was busy but I think we had just beat the crowds since we were able to get seated within 10 minutes. The ordering system is a bit interesting, but you basically get assigned a table number, and you order at the counter, telling them your number. Then you get seated at that table. We ordered the chicken tinga tacos and the pork tacos. We also ordered a side salad, but I think they might have mixed us up with another table because instead of the side salad, we got the pumpkin seed dip.We hadn't ordered the dip, but they let us keep it, and it was really good! It's almost like a hummus, but has a different flavor that I can't really describe. The chips were a little salty, but the jicama and cucumbers were both really fresh and tasted great dipped in the dip. The chicken tacos were really flavorful and well cooked. The avocado added a nice creaminess, and the salsa on the side provided a nice kick. The pork tacos, on the other hand, weren't as saucy as the chicken, but the pork was so so so tender! The salsa verde that comes with it gives it just enough flavor to prevent from being bland. I really like the pork ones because they weren't drenched in sauce to make you feel unhealthy.The salad we had ordered wasn't coming but when we asked about it, they actually brought it out. Again, I think they might have messed up and given the dip to the wrong table, but it was nice that they let us keep it and still gave us the salad. The salad was pretty bad though, in my opinion; the dressing was just off for me -- too vinegar-y I think.Overall, Xoco has a lot of hype because of it's celebrity owner. The restaurant is a twist on Mexican, so if you're looking for authentic tacos, there are other places to go. The atmosphere is busy and lively, and the prices are acceptable for the area. I would probably be willing to come back to try one of their tortas if given the chance!"}, {"review_id": "OcR3UP6i_WUYr-LXJe0KTA", "user_id": "J3PHcPBvvip7gzZggTRuIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Busy place in river north.
