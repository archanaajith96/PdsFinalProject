One time I waited 2 hours, this time I waited only 4 minutes (and it was super empty inside @ 4pm). The service is good, nothing too special. You get to pick from two sets or you can order your meal a la carte. It's a little bit on the expensive side, seeing you can get the same at an ayce, but the quality is pretty good. Good enough that you can splurge once every few months. Their doshirak is superb, egg stew is delicious, and the overall vibes of this place are spot-on! Concept has always been great at KHDB. The only complaints I have is that they barely give you any banchan (side dishes) and that they don't have any rice paper. It's not needed, but my American friends usually really look forward to rice paper when they go out for Korean barbecue."}, {"review_id": "P-YzBUyomAfKCUadGGeABw", "user_id": "gqfH-DkwRx0ao5cfGmdeLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "This was by far the best KBBQ place I've ever been to in my life and I've been to many.

After killing time at Gaam for 1.5 hr, we were finally summoned back to the restaurant for our table. Thankfully, they had a niffy text system that alerts you when your table is ready so we didn't have to stand and wait the entire time there. We ordered the small beef combo which came with the brisket, boneless short rib, and rib eye. It was just the right amount of food for our group of three. And I have to admit this Korean bbq restaurant is worth the hype and the extremely long wait. Thank god they had someone cook the meat for us because we were too busy stuffing ourselves with the tender and flavorful meat. But on the other hand, their corn cheese was bland and not cheesy enough. No complaints about the other banchan offered except that there is a charge to refill the seaweed?  Like come on, it's just seaweed. But I guess that can be excused because the Korean meat is so damn delicious!

Every \"Baekjeong\" restaurant is filled with traditional posters and furniture that makes you feel like you're in Korea. Baekjeong was ranked as one of \"101 best restaurants\" by food critic Jonathan Gold and named as one of the \"99 Essential Restaurants\" in 2013 and 2016 by LA Weekly. Most importantly, Yelp ranked it as \"Top 100 places to Eat 2016\" - how can I miss it!!They offer valet parking for $7, and $ with validation. Just do it, it's a lot easier and it's almost impossible to find parking outside the complex. Friday night at 7pm had a wait around an hour (exactly what they quoted), which wasn't bad at all. There's a check in station where a waiter will record your name and phone number, and you'll receive a text when the table is ready. That way you can walk around ktown with no fear!Banchan was amazing - not as many options as most korean restaurants, but it's great. There's instructions on how to eat their Badkjeong SSAM - lay a piece of dried seaweed on your palm, add pink radish, soybean sprout salad, romaine salad, sauce, kimchi, and top it off with bbq meat!!!! It's the bomb. SO GOOD. The seaweed is extra charge for refill. Sprout salad and Romaine salad comes in a giant tub, both are delicious, and you can keep asking for more.The grill is circular, with side compartments of liquid egg, corn cheese, and minimal grilled veggie. The waiter comes to your table and grills everything for you. We went with the beef combo, which is a very great value considering 1 meat is $40+ already. It feeds the 3 of us with full stomach!Beef Combo - thinly sliced brisket + seasoned prime boneless short rib + prime boneless short rib/prime rib eye + beef brisket soybean paste stew / kimchi stew.   THINLY SLICED BRISKET was good, it's a great starter. Cooked super fast, it's easily charred and the slightly burnt ends are amazing. PRIME BONELESS SHORT RIB is the absolute best!!! The meat quality was phenomenal, cooked to medium, and the meat to fat ratio is heavenly it literally melts in your mouth. Dip it into their house sauce, it's incredible and enhances the flavor dramatically. SEASONED PRIME BONELESS SHORT RIB is good too, a close #2. The seasoning was good with soy, garlic, and other stuff. This one is fatty and melts too, and is good on its own without dipping sauce. SOYBEAN PASTE STEW was gross...sorry.Worth the wait, worth the traffic to LA, worth every penny. Just come!Favorites:* beef combo small ($69.99)"}, {"review_id": "L055dlRnhBeSqkMjd93zqg", "user_id": "-RApyq06DMBii7ovXtQnfw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Meat is very good quality.

You'll usually find a wait here (and anywhere else in this plaza) so if you're in a rush don't bother. The plaza offers valet for $7 ($5 if you validate).

Our waitress got this frozen face all the time. It seems none of the ventilation hood is working. There is smoke everywhere. I got tears in my eyes because of the smoke. I never had that before in any of the KBBQ places. They only have 1 toilet for women and 1 for men, their employees are using the same toilet. The wait is long. And the toilet won't even flush.

The experience was largely similar, with only a few differences - particularly with the banchan composition (the TC location provided potato salad, white kimchi soup, and rice paper - this location does not, but does supply seaweed ...).All in all, definitely at least a 4-star experience at this non-AYCE KBBQ joint. Service was fairly decent for the most part, although I should note that the staff was conspicuously clumsy when it came to cutting/cooking our meat - 2 different servers repeatedly dropped pieces of meat on our grill into the liquid egg section ... xDThe customer seating is quite uncomfortable, and parking was extremely limited on a late Thursday night (we had to circle the block and surrounding blocks several times before we got lucky and found a curb spot). On the other hand, we only had to wait less than 5 minutes before we got a table, and the restaurant is open until 1:30AM every night (plus, it never hurts when a restaurant is blasting Seven Lions in the dining area).All in all, if you're looking for full-service non-AYCE KBBQ late night in K-Town, this is a legit option.

Unfortunately their combos are a bit bigger which makes it harder to get variety for a party of 2. Quarters does a better job in this area. The secondary dishes (egg, cheese corn, veggies) are also not that great - Quarters steam egg is better, the cheese is also better but there is no corn, and veggies are both there for show. However the meat is on par with quarters - the ribeye is great, the sliced beef is great, the pork jowl is a bit fatty but great too.Where Kang Ho-dong is better than Quarters is the sides, where they offer similar things but KHD provides the turnip wraps and Ssam sauce on request. For people into making their own wraps, KHD is the clear winner. Personally I'd return to Quarters for the easier variety and better egg + cheese but wouldn't mind going to KHD if the group is bigger or the wait is shorter."}, {"review_id": "iParJyTWNOM0jdoxBWALUg", "user_id": "xg8h8TfP1Hb741fXnpvm2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "First time here a couple of nights ago and definitely not disappointed!

It's on the pricey side, but you get for what you paid for right? $20-40 a person. It's very spacious, so you have breathing room compared to all-you-can-eat KBBQ places. Unlike a.y.c.e kbbq places, the sides are slightly different: no rice paper, potato salad, fish cake, rice, BUT they have cheese corn, scrambled eggs (that cook around the grill), dry-seasoned seaweed, and an omelette (?idk what it is actually lol).Service: Never have I ever had such great service at KBBQ. Our server, Kevin, cooked our food perfectly while serving 3 other tables. He would cook our meat and turn off the fire to let us enjoy; then, he'd come back shortly once everything is done and start the next meat, nothing over cooked, nothing undercooked. They also don't rush you to pay, which is excellent.Food: I'll just talk about the selections of the Beef Combo (Small, $65, was enough for 2 people). The selections were served a way to fill the customer yet have us enjoy the meal as it progressed.1) soybean paste beef stew): mildly spicy stew that packs a whole lot of umami and other flavours.2) thinly sliced brisket was actually thin and tender surprisingly compared to your cheap a.y.c.e brisket that you have to cook yourself. 3) prime boneless short rib: literally the climax of the meal. The marble of the meat already shows it will be succulent and tender. After Kevin cooked and placed these medium-rare pieces into a heart shape (since we were a couple, cute, cringe). The meat melted in our mouths.4) seasoned prime boneless short rib: this is the conclusion of your meal and makes you wish you had more prime short ribs. This one isn't as marbled and tender as the climax, but the marinade, fat, and slight char make it almost if not equally satisfying to eat.Overall, great experience, but make sure you have money! My problem is that it was pretty expensive especially for eating uncomfortably: sitting on short, hard chairs  (small wooden chairs, no cushion for my butt, no back support 'cause it stops half way up my back) and using uncomfortable chopsticks (those thin metallic ones, hard to hold, gets heavy as you hold it, can barely pick up anything with it)."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/kang-ho-dong-baekjeong-los-angeles-4?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
