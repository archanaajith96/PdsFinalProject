From the sea foam walls to the little trinkets on the front desk, I loved the homey vibe that it gives off. Also, it smelled SO good when we walked in. We later found out it was the soup du jour, tomato soup, which my friend ended up loving! I took a chance and ordered their French sandwich with ham, pear, and a few other simple ingredients, and it was honestly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in Norfolk. For a side, I chose the pasta salad, which was also pretty great. The selection of craft sodas were pretty solid! I got a ginger ale that I really enjoyed. Overall, I would definitely recommend them for a simple but delicious lunch!"}, {"review_id": "Uj4yiTwpsCdlGOF99vYgDw", "user_id": "llNEW4qRUflzQs3hyetqSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "Really cool interior and I loved the pinball machine. Great mix of people with several regulars.I enjoyed the goat cheese, candied walnut salad with a side a salmon. Very big portion as I couldn't finish it. Ton of goat cheese!Friendly service with a wide selection. There were at least 9 others things I considered ordering.I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "f95e94TgMHB4zr3Ro3kIjQ", "user_id": "mGRr4CfnlavBOqzlwkjWOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "I live walking distance from this place and go semi-regularly. This place is tiny, the kitchen is open and equally tiny. That said, they turn out quality food. Also of note, they probably have the best meatloaf in the city. Simple food prepared well at fair prices is what I want from small places and that is exactly what I always get here. Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "-5yesFeFHH0Dk1VxpPOrMg", "user_id": "Pu_Itw0HT3KV8sfeEmEtfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Decided to explore out today in Ghent area of Norfolk. I found this place which had great reviews which made me check it out and nothing short of amazing. Has the mom and pop feel to it but the food is much more superb than any mom and pop shop. I definitely understand the great rating. My overall experience was great, food was fast & excellent and I look forward to returning."}, {"review_id": "Nt-mUoe4OhpRot-ewhgw3Q", "user_id": "ZvkbHmIQg0z28aPoLB8-QQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "Omg, why are we so late with Ten Top?!It's a small restaurant - 5 tables, a row of high top chairs at the window to people watch and eat. Eclectic and funky cool, bright decor. Lots of colors, chalkboard signs, and even a bunch of little tchotchkes at the counter beside the chips. You order your food at the counter, & choose your own seats. Today, we chose the Pimento Cheese with French bread as an app (big portion & delicious.) Fiancé Duane D. had the gryo sandwich with potato salad - he loved it!! And I chose the special - crab cake sandwich which comes topped with a mound of Pimento cheese, and strips of perfectly cooked bacon. My side was also their potato salad - huge chunks of potato, such great flavor too. Their prices are so great! My special was $9.49!! Great price for a huge amount of delicious food. If we lived closer to, or were in Norfolk frequently, this would be one of my go-to spots. It was just a little hot in there, hot day, and maybe the ac wasn't on too strong. But who cares. Food was amazing. We will be back, definitely."}, {"review_id": "cvD1oQbSjCGlIw2jGa8gHA", "user_id": "_eftsQ8CtVaGaxUsptWP7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/5/2017", "text": "Why did I never realize this place was here?! I have been missing out for so long...This place deserves much more attention than it gets. It is tucked away behind a few shops on Colley Avenue with a tiny inside and small staff. The food tasted GREAT. So great, that I can't wait to go back.I got the Grilled Turkey & Spinach Flatbread Sandwich, which I would honestly give a 9.5/10. You'd think this sandwich was bland based on the name, but it tasted amazing with its thin bread, gooey cheese, and great quality seasoned turkey.They have a few baked goods that looked amazing that I will have to try next time. They also have a drink fridge with some interesting choices you don't usually see elsewhere.This place has been around for a while and has a GREAT menu variety. Check it out the next chance you get!"}, {"review_id": "DeP8SqBm40486NsFgQh1gw", "user_id": "_mPrUh0PhG8BpGs-RQkaWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "ATTENTION EVERYONE YOU MUST EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE SO ALREADY. YOU WILL THANK ME LATER. Let me first start off by saying that the inside/outside is a little rough. I was skeptical at first, but decided to give this place a shot because of all their positive reviews. You order at the counter and then you are free to sit wherever you would like-seating is limited because of how small the space is. I ordered their special for the day, which was a wrap. I can't remember exactly what it was called, but know that it came with spinach, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, and chicken. The wrap was very refreshing and tasted delicious. My fiancé ordered their grilled turkey and spinach flatbread-OMG!! It tasted so freaking good! I would highly recommend that anyone unsure of what to order, order this! Let's just say I ate more of his than my own. Each entree comes with a side of potato salad, pasta salad, oranges, cole slaw, or a bag of chips. My fiancé and I opted for the pasta salad-very good! I can't wait to try more of their sandwiches and wraps! We will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "eY4aAvW0N9RPVyKjVz74ow", "user_id": "1riK6beX-Weo6jm03PFLRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "My first and last time I came here was sometime in 2015 and it was a mistake for not revisiting this place any sooner. After having a smoothie from Strawberry Fields, I was looking for a spot to eat and luckily The Ten Top was right around the corner. It was a little busy when me and my girlfriend walked in and we both kinda had an idea of what we wanted. My last experience here I had the greek lamb hoagie with a pasta salad and it was BOMB. I didn't feel like looking through the menu so I got it again and it tasted just as good as the first time I had it. The mozzarella cheese that is melted on top of the lamb really intensifies the texture and flavor of the hoagie. Small location and good service. The Ten Top instantly became one of my top 5 spots to eat in Norfolk."}, {"review_id": "uaZUZCXG9elJKOBlVQwuqg", "user_id": "co64BGDz5U4i-VOwhJgn5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "We stopped by one afternoon last fall.

Why the 3 stars? I once was put on hold for 15 minutes, and decided to just walk to The Ten Top and was on hold until I walked in and let them know. The waitress was embarrassed, but seemed more intent on changing subjects (probably so her manager wouldn't realize) than acknowledging the screw up. I usually get the turkey apple sandwich. It tastes like they roast the turkey themselves, it is hearty and thick. I usually prefer thin/smoked turkey but it's still good. Potato salad is good, as is chicken salad. Everything is basic but fresh. I've had the cheese tortellini and thai peanut noodles too, huge portions for the price and quite tasty.However -- I have had the greek lamb hoagie and that was terrible! It was more of a spinach/cheese sandwich, with about 4 small pieces of very tough/flavorless lamb. I ended up just picking the lamb out."}, {"review_id": "xOOEbt9f1w2erAblyhvnQA", "user_id": "2sGjMoK-sKeZyi5G0390JQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I love ten top! I love soup.

There's a small, dedicated lot, but mostly street parking either on Shirley or Colley. Great spot for lunch.. love that lots of the salads are made in house. You could see the work going on in the prep kitchen. About 5 tables inside as well as some bar seating, so don't bring too big of a crowd, but they're open for lunch and dinner. Multiple specials available daily, including 3 soups that were available. I got the goat cheese and candied walnut salad and added a crabcake - good size salad for the price and I ate half of it and took the rest home. Husband got the chicken salad sandwich on yummy ciabatta and the habanero potato soup. And they had a kids menu, so Max got a grilled cheese with orange slices on the side and he made sure to mention to the lady that \"this grilled cheese is even better than I thought!\"Even though it's a QSR, lady came by to make sure everything was tasting good. Overall, pleased with the quick lunch and will return to try more fresh items."}, {"review_id": "GkSm8XXkxYSOaFsRYUAuug", "user_id": "8QKlX8LI02gsJMsSkMDz8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "If I move away from Norfolk The Ten Top will probably be the thing I miss the most. The food is amazing! I have had so many of their sandwiches and specials and have never been disappointed. The portions are big enough that I usually eat half for lunch and the rest for dinner.

I appreciate a good deli that slices their own meat and gives good portions and unfortunately they are hard to come by. I have only heard good things about this place, so I'm glad I stopped in. Its a small place and I wouldn't recommend coming in with too large of a group, I was by myself and found a seat at the window. I ordered their lunch special for that particular day. Smoked Ham, Pimento Cheese, Chipotle Aioli, House Pickles, Arugula & Tomato on a French Baguette with pasta salad. The sandwich was massive and with all those ingredients on it, I liked that it came on baguette instead of regular sandwich bread, because it would have gotten messy.  The ham was some of the thickest I've ever had, but the pickles and aoili did get lost in the midst of all the pimento cheese and I dont really remember tasting it. It wasn't a negative for me because overall the meal was perfect and I will definitely be back again."}, {"review_id": "Z9GiSlW76O1WJvT0Rho-Vw", "user_id": "9WvMB1HUVkj4DZrey0jE7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/31/2017", "text": "Does get much better than this.

Portion was good as well, and I was super hungry! Next time I think I'll skip the pasta salad, it was pretty heavy on the dried seasoning which I didn't care for.

This is my first time here but it would be hard to find comfort sandwiches in the nearby area better than the ones here. Better than Frill bar across the street for lunch. SERVICEExcellent. I was hesitant to order the meatloaf, but Rick (one of the owners) recommended it (based specifically on my interests/cravings), and checked up on me twice afterwards. RICK'S MEATLOAF SANDWICHSo good. If I wasn't hangry, I would've had to take some to-go bc it's a decent sized portion.  I had the homemade potato salad which tastes amazing. I can tell it was handmade recently and wasn't a brand name type that from a huge grocery store. It was so soft as if it was whipped along with nice chunks of potato and celery. I'll be recommending my GF (who lives in the area) to come here. Tl;dr. Better than \"No Frill...\" for a filling quick (homemade) lunch."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ten-top-norfolk?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
