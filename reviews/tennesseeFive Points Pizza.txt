I'm from NY and I love NY style pizza & Five Points definitely comes close. They have a restaurant and next door is a carry out area. I've never eaten at the restaurant only have gotten carry out or from the window late night. There's a ledge and some bar stools on that side if you do want to stay and eat a slice.The have the traditional cheese and pepperoni and also have the prosciutto and basil most of the time on their menu. They also have a veggie and meat special daily. All of those can be ordered by the slice if you don't want a whole pie. You can also order their other specialty pizzas but it would be the whole pie. I have had tried all the toppings they have for by the slice and you can't go wrong. The last time we went we ordered a pie (spinach, mushroom, and Gorgonzola) we added Italian sausage and it was delicious!! The crust is thin, the tomato sauce is tangy, and all the ingredients are fresh.My absolute favorite and a must stop whenever I'm in Nashville."}, {"review_id": "7vereEHOG4BBS43gSLxnyQ", "user_id": "GFRqTfOT-73lzNwsvCWJpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "I've never seen such a busy pizza place before. The indoor eating area was packed. The take our area was a little less busy. We were hanging out at the bar next door. It was humming but, not like this place. I YELPED Five points and saw that it lived up to all the physical hype. I walked over there and stood in the take out line and ordered some talked about garlic rolls. I sat on a stool and waited and quicker then expected out popped my garlic rolls. I'm a fan. The rolls were delicious dipped in the sauce. The people who were seated around me were pleasant and chatted with me as I waited. The majority of the guests are locals. This is a bit out of the way from the tourist crowd.If I'm in the area I'd come back."}, {"review_id": "RnXHRk_3CAGqiVJXh_zJmw", "user_id": "bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "I have not had a crust this thin and crispy since Brooklyn! Major props to this place for having more than just the usual cheese and pepperoni slices available- their Proscuitto & Basil slice was really great, and they also have featured veggie and meat slices, maxing out at $5 apiece.Service was quick and friendly. Location has a slice counter with takeout or a small dining counter, as well as a separate dine-in area for the full restaurant. Late-night hours and lunch specials are available, as is a highly recommended habanero-cream sauce for dipping your crust."}, {"review_id": "353Pe1MNokLXw6LMziQeAw", "user_id": "ab_v0tIf7A8SH4ppUny2kg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Visiting here from California so it was our first time. The place itself is modern. The food was delicious! First we ordered garlic knots which were amazing! If you like garlic do yourself a favor and order you some knots, you won't regret it. In regards to the pizza we ordered two 14\" pies that you could split in half's to different types. We ordered half Bianca and Pesto on one, the other pie was habanero cream sauce pie and T-Rex. All 4 of these were delicious! My personal favorite was the Bianca, if you are a cheese lover this is a must to try. Pizza here was great the only thing not so great was the attitude of the workers. Our server was quick however not talkative and didn't have a very pleasant attitude. If you're ever on this area don't hesitate to visit, it will not disappoint."}, {"review_id": "Xx7bCCUR3oBPgQmtpjCezw", "user_id": "XCRHoUfI2ZE5N108qCxHzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Hadn't been here before and had heard wonderful things. I've only been to east Nashville a handful of times, but I definitely need to visit it more. There isn't parking for actual space, so be ready to find parking elsewhere.  The actual restaurant is quite small and seating is limited. There were five of us girls and we opted to squeeze into a booth. Let me just, with the amount and size of food, I wouldn't do that again. Lol. Service started a little slow but ended great.  Very attentive once we got our food. We came for lunch. I ordered the lunch special: two slices of pizza and a drink. I didn't want to order regular slices, so I ordered two of their daily specials. Meat and prosciutto. Since I had read great things about the garlic knots, I HAD to get a half order. Did I mention their food is huge?!  I probably shouldn't have ordered that much food lol. I left with a box. Pizza was great and the knots were amazing. Oh and huge.

Yes please!My family and I ordered the garlic knots and the 20\" T-Rex pizza. Needless to say, the 20\" was plenty enough for a family of 4 (two of the people being 7&1) and then some. The slices themselves are HUGE. I could have easily been full from one. The garlic knots:They come in a full order (4) or a half order (2), with a side of marinara sauce. They are covered in  garlic salt, oil, and garnish. The marinara sauce makes the knots much better, however. They didn't seem like anything special, but we're good enough that we would probably order them next time. T-Rex pizza:Covered in sliced meatballs, Italian sausage, pepperoni, and spicy capicola. This was a mighty pizza, packed with meat. The \"T-Rex\" is an appropriate name, you'd have to be a monster with an appetite to eat that giant pizza in one sitting. The spicy capicola wasn't super spicy, but added a good little kick every few bites. The crust was cooked perfectly. Crispy, but not tough. Next time we will stick to the 18\"! The restaurant building is split into three sections: Take out, window, and dine in. The dine-in area isn't very large, and has a small bar that they direct you to wait by if there's no seating immediately ready. We came at dinner time and ended up only having to wait about 15 mins, not bad at all. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Our server was super nice to our two boys (7,1). Our oldest was given some pizza dough to play with while we waited, such a cute idea! Our meals came out quickly and was eaten even quicker. We ended up leaving with almost half he Pizza however. So maybe we'll stick with the 18\" if it's just us again. We would go back again for"}, {"review_id": "wmyAmbGeTEU3fS_dq01qFg", "user_id": "vst6BtiWFIJN0OeKKZWddA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Best pizza!!

As I was heading to the airport to pick up friends that were visiting I was racking my brain to think of something which would be quick, easy, affordable and a crowd pleaser. Five Points Pizza fit the bill on all of these stipulations. This New-York style pizza spot has a late-night window and a restaurant. Their menu has salads/starters, stromboli and pizza. They even have vegan pizza which was a selling point since I could bring one of my friends here. Five Points Pizza has beer, wine and cider on their drink menu. My friend and I split the Greek salad ($6) as a starter which is the perfect size for 2 people. The Mediterranean feta dressing works well on this salad. To appease my vegan friend three of us shared the 'Vegan pie' which is Daiya vegan cheese, spinach, artichokes, red onion, whole roasted garlic and chopped basil (they don't sell vegan pizza by the slice). We ordered the 14\" of this pie but when they brought it out it was actually the 18\" ($25) which ended up being fine so we could take some home. My friend ordered the meatball stromboli as her entree ($9) which was delicious (she gave me a bite). The dough was baked to a beautiful golden brown and the fillings were great. This is served with a side of marinara sauce. Service was okay but the server we had was a bit of a smart aleck. When my friend ordered she said \"We'd like to split the vegan pie, the one with the vegan cheese on it\" and he responded with \"Well that's what a vegan pie is...it has the vegan cheese on it\". He kind of made her feel stupid for saying that, which wasn't necessary. As I mentioned above the pizza size was incorrect but we were fine with that. I would definitely come back here as the pizza is great. I have yet to try every pizza place in Nashville but this has to be up there at the top. I heard that they will be opening a second location off of Charlotte Avenue in West Nashville so I will eagerly await that day! Also just a note-parking can be a bit tricky in this location. We got street parking on S. 11th street but we were lucky."}, {"review_id": "H3ndFh5KS4qrlVRuevboiQ", "user_id": "wfjfBG3qN9ayxNzWo-OLBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Great pizza !!!

Being the Yelper I am, naturally I had to scroll through reviews before dragging my boyfriend and friends here on a Saturday night. There was an hour wait... so if you come on the weekends, be sure to come at an odd time (i.e. not a typical meal time) otherwise you'll be waiting for a WHILE. The host took our name and a phone number, so we actually went to wait and have dessert before dinner at Soda Parlor but after an hour, we were confused as to why our table wasn't ready yet (mostly because they told us it'd be a 45 minute wait) so it was only when we actually got back and asked that they told us they were cleaning off a table for us. So be wary when waiting, and be sure to ask if it's been a while. We ended up ordering a 14\" pizza (half T-Rex and half Hawaiian) and a half order of garlic knots. The garlic knots were good! The ingredients were fresh and there was plenty of garlic for my boyfriend to not want to come near me afterwards. The pizza was subpar. It really isn't as good as everyone keeps saying it is. It was way over cooked, even burnt, and honestly, I've had better pizza at Pizza Hut. It kept falling apart and there was zero cheese pull. What kinda pizza doesn't have cheese pull!? It was disappointing and I was just sad because I love NY style pizza and this just wasn't it."}, {"review_id": "BkFjV7uuMyF2oKJ5STl3bA", "user_id": "3IH8qG5FNKZuMRY5TSlgYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Delicious pizza!

The topping options were endless, the beers on tap were all local, crafty and delish, and the staff were more than awesome in helping us find the best options. After sampling a few beers the waitress recommended, as a table we ordered two IPAs (forgive me I forget the names) and loved them both. For pizza we all ended up getting different slices from the specials board. Honestly I can't tell you all the toppings but basically they were freakin delicious and perfectly filling. Not too salty or greasy, and no short handing it - they give you all the goods!The bathrooms smelled very nice and were gender neutral. Parking was easy and free on the street or in the back lots. There's tons of unique, small business shopping nearby. The staff are incredibly kind. The prices are amazingly affordable. They have, what seems to be, every local newspaper and magazine on hand.
