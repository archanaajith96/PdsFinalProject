The food is so good and each time I've been there I've gotten the same kebab with different sides and it's been consistent and the sides have been delicious and fresh. The price point might seem a bit high at first but you get a lot of good food for what you pay.

Yes, my breath was on fire. The food was perfectly spiced. I will warn you that the kobida is spicy, so steer clear if you're not about that life. I ordered the lamb kebab before, and I wasn't crazy about it. Personally, I think the kobida is better than the lamb. My order was accurate and ordering was easy. It's pricey, so I'll space out my takeout orders accordingly. Also, I think it would be helpful to have a description of the meats. For example, I had no idea what kobida consisted off. So I Googled it. Also, is it lamb cubes or ground? I could ask, but sometimes it's better to have the information readily available."}, {"review_id": "rHFnr1uMFXJ_4mAhgcbTRA", "user_id": "VyD8dp6UDqekRNxpJ5mbbg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "So me and my boyfriend Jacob were out shopping and began to get a little peckish...we hopped on yelp like usual, in search for something new and stumbled across this place..and we are so glad we did.

From service, to menu knowledge, presentation to flavors this place has it all and they do it with perfection. I've had my eye on this spot for a while, I mean you must be doing something right to have a 5 star yelp review and almost 300 reviews, right?I had the Chicken skewers with chick peas and eggplant as my sides. Let me start by saying everything is seasoned to perfection.My plate came with a flavorful rice and a pita like bread that I imagine they use on their gyros as well, it was warm and pillowy and everything I'd hoped for. The eggplant was probably my favorite part of the dish, I couldn't get enough. My chicken was juicy, flavorful and seasoned well.The dish was so cohesive.... everything just flowed into the next part of the meal ( even though I ended up piling stuff up on the bread almost like a sandwich)I honestly can't find the words to do this place justice, until you get in here and try it for yourself you won't know what your missing!PS the dishes come out looking like every single one of the pictures posted tooTip- If you like Spicy food ask for a side of their hot sauce!!"}, {"review_id": "sLt4ZtQ72HlLUji35LKdBQ", "user_id": "TrU49Ydk2ZMjlh0rtOVj7g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "That's just how quickly things can change. I feel compelled to downgrade Mazari after today's visit. Changes have taken place that do not reflect my glowing 5 stars of the business 9 months ago. Staff changes have occurred over the past six months. The original chef Mike is gone and it has not been the same. However, in my two visits preceding Mike's departure I have been able too keep them at a 5 with Marvin running the kitchen. A man who I first saw smoking outside the business began to clean the exterior windows. Today again new staff that I have not met. The man and woman were friendly. The dining room was clean and dead at just before noon. That quickly changed over the next 15 minutes with 10 customers entering for eat-in business. The bar space continues to not be utilized and had miscellaneous items including a drill on top. My order a chicken kabob, kabuli rice, egg plant and chick pea. Prices have remained the same. The plate was ready in about 10-12 minutes and it was shocking to see they have now moved to paper plates and plastic utensils. Several reasons why I disagree with the practice of paper. However, it's the business that suffers from FREE marketing of those beautifully plated dishes by users on Instagram. The first noticeable item was plating, not nearly as pretty on paper and runny egg plant sauce. The chicken was tender and flavorful, the rice as good as I recall from other visits. The click peas seemed off and my favorite egg plant although tasty had so much broth it soaked the paper clear through. Also a big change to the pita which was a nice large piece of pita you could make like a taco. Now it's thin layers of pita cut in triangles. Overall the food a 4. The man I first saw clean the exterior windows came back to the kitchen to help with the crowd. He did not wash his hands. I then later saw him put on gloves. I was pretty disgusted. I'm in no rush to return and I suspect very recent changes this month will adversely affect their perfect 5 in coming months. 3.5, rounding down."}, {"review_id": "B3tn48SWrhjy1C6hdZPnWw", "user_id": "Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Review #077 - 2018When I saw this place pop up with 5 stars, I knew I had to come and try it out.  My girlfriend was very accommodating and willing to try this spot with me.When we showed up around 7:20 PM, there was only one other couple dining in so I was a little confused as to how they got such great ratings.The couple sitting there told us that they've been coming here since they first opened, when it was originally owned by the parents.  That alone tells me that the food must be pretty darn great!While all the dishes were well seasoned and tasty, the meats were unfortunately a little tough.  The lamb and ribeye would have been much tastier had they been cooked medium rare or even medium.  But they were well done so they were kind of dry & tough; however, my girlfriend said that she would consider coming back again with her husband."}, {"review_id": "tsueDWEeik1G_h1LpiqoSg", "user_id": "hWDybu_KvYLSdEFzGrniTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "A really excellent dinner here with Mom this week. From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look all that fancy which is okay because all the magic happens in the kitchen. And magic it absolutely is. They're turning out some terrific kebabs here at Mazari!Order and pay at the register and then find a seat. I'd recommend choosing a table where you can see into the kitchen. It's almost a show, watching this guy put together the plates of food.We got one lamb kebab dinner and one chicken kebab dinner which took about 15 minutes to be put together. Being able to see into the kitchen, we could see that the kebabs are pretty much cooked to order though the sides are already done.The plates are large and they're very nicely presented. The white sauce is a sour cream and mayo mix. Don't miss out on it. I got mine with the kidney beans and brown rice. Mom got the potatoes. Both are big portions and deliciously loaded with flavor. You will clear the plate as I did.Quite inexpensive for food of this excellent quality. It's not terribly fancy but the dinners are delicious and well prices.

Seriously, enough for two.2) I didn't feel heavy after eating half my meal. This means I can eat a lot and not spend the rest of my day sleeping.3) Hell yeah, this food is good. I had the rib eye kebab with eggplant and chickpeas. Every bite was amazing.4) There was so much food that I ate until I was content and was happy that I was going to enjoy Mazari at home.5) The problem with leftovers is that they don't always taste good. Leftovers were so good that I wished I purchased two meals.Guess that means I'm going back!Oh, by the way, there's nothing fancy about this place. Just a hole in the wall-like location off the beaten path that serves up some delicious ass food.

However, I cannot justify the slow service and lack of positive customer service attitude. This was my first time here, and since I am not familiar with Mediterranean foods, I asked the cashier/cook/manager what various things were. Although he answered my questions, I could tell he was getting annoyed. Thus, I ordered two dishes quickly and sat down to wait. There was one couple that ordered before us but we still waited 20+ minutes for our two dishes! That's shockingly slow for a restaurant, and I'm hoping it's because they cooked everything fresh...who knows... Hopefully they are able to better handle a lunch crowd on weekdays. This would be a great place to go with coworkers but I cannot take the chance of spending half an hour to order and receive my food. But if speed is not a priority for you, this place does make some very delicious chicken kabob, gyro, and Afghan salad! The eggplant side was amazing and I loved their homemade potato chips. I would probably come here again to give them another chance at customer service and maybe give them more stars.

If you all remember the Highlander restaurant, Mazari now occupies that space. I was so determined to come here that even though google maps steered me wrong for about twenty minutes, I still didn't give up and finally found this little piece of heaven on earth. So, just FYI, maps/yelp directions will bring you to the wrong area. Just look directly across the street from the cemetery on witchduck and you'll see a little sign with an exceptionally large parking lot. Mazari is an order at the counter type of place, with whiteboard menus and self-serve coffee/tea. It is very casual, but offers exceptional food! I ordered the gyro plate with brown rice, chickpeas, a pita, and eggplant. The portions are more than enough for one serving, although once you taste the food you might not be able to stop. Everything is seasoned to perfection and the gyro meat was so tender! The chickpeas were great but let me tell you about this eggplant side dish... it is phenomenal! I think I finished the eggplant before anything else on my plate honestly haha. My boyfriend said the chicken kebab plate was really tasty as well. I will 1000000000000% be back for some take out (and plenty of more eggplant)!

It's spacious and there's a big TV, so to enjoy your food on any channel is a win.The food is made to order, the meats that is, and the side dishes are staying warm in their flavor/juices giving its robust taste. My favorite side is the eggplant. However way they cook and season it, it's the best eggplants I've had. The chicken and beef is grilled tender and the sauces accompanying them is delish! There's also vegetarian options.The guys behind the counter are nice and helpful when trying to figure out what to order. You can see them cook or put your food together because the kitchen is right behind the counter.
