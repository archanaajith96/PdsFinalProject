I came here for a drink before a Red Sox game and there was available seating at the bar.I ordered the Bloody Mary (half habanero and half vegetable vodka).

The high ceilings, Amber stone-like chandelier lights, mahogany tones, and red leather hightop booth seating -- I felt transported to a grand retro sci-fi hotel lounge.The food: French dip, endive grapefruit salad, oysters on the raw. French dip was scrumptious! Generous medium-done beef pieces stuffed into a delectable French baguette with a rich au jus sauce. We had to send back the endive salad -- leaves were overly wilted, its bitterness was overpowering, and could not taste the balsamic glaze enough. Oysters were great (it's BOSTON), but wished they had happy hour $1 shucks!Would be back to try other options :-)"}, {"review_id": "AXwX3logqyJTh-95zvhI-w", "user_id": "581NruH_Ns8_FH7jr9wLiQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "I was in here a couple of weeks ago.  The headline of my review would be \"cool place but my experience was a slightly disappointing.\" First the positive:  Eastern Standard Kitchen has got great ambiance.  It feels old school and classic with wood paneled walls everywhere.  The service was exceptional and really could not have been better.  We ordered appetizers of mussels and bone marrow and both were good.  I had not had bone marrow for quite some time and thought it was perfect.  The cocktails were better than average and the wine selection was decent also.  We had a delicious bottle of California red.  The entrees were where I was disappointed.  However, someone in our party ordered the salmon and totally loved it.  But I digress, my daughter and I both ordered the bone in sirloin and both ordered it medium.  Mine came out medium rare, was tough and not very tasty.  I chose to eat mine as I really don't like to send things back.  My daughter's came out rare and we didn't have any other choice but to send it back.  Then it came out rare again (?!?).  Finally, when it came out the 3rd time, it was medium.  They did take her meal off the bill but it was all pretty disappointing.  I am not sure what the chef was thinking.  I am not sure where they sourced the beef from either, ...as I have had better from a 2nd rate supermarket.  Anyway, I may go back ... but I will stick to the seafood and stay away from the beef.  Overall an OK experience but based on other ratings and reviews I was expecting more."}, {"review_id": "71gzjdfavW8vIaLryWS7LA", "user_id": "FC1ZSB9fd4WlDMSAbEjq8Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I came here for lunch. The service was shockingly bad.Our waiter was on top of everything in the beginning. He took our orders, and our food came out about 30 min later. I had the salmon which was delicious by the way.After waiting forever, our waiter came back and asked us if we wanted dessert. BIG MISTAKE. I should not have ordered desert- that meant sitting there for another hour just to eat a slice of cake. I had the flourless chocolate cake. We waited for 30 min before the cake was served. Our waiter never checked on us. I literally had to chase him down to ask for the check, and that took several attempts. That took another 30 min. Never coming back for lunch again. Service is so slow- its a waste of time. I don't have one hour to eat desert, and I do not want to spend 30 min trying to chase down my waiter."}, {"review_id": "AazDy_F-qWGOOKXWic6rMA", "user_id": "hTzcHtk4-0QJnFUbkKpd5Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We don't live here but relied on the reviews give when we chose this restaurant for lunch. Walking in you can tell it is a more upscale restaurant, and the pricing also reflects that.To start the service was not great at all. I'm not sure if she just saw 2 young adults and then wrote us off or what. Other people around us looked like they were getting plenty of attention with 2 managers stopping by to talk with them and clear the table. There was no recommendation on the menu (she could tell we were struggling with what to choose too). To start we ordered the calamari ($12) and the carafe of red wine ($18), the only 2 things I can say we enjoyed. My husband ordered the pasta and I ordered the salmon dish. When I ordered the salmon she asked how I would like it cooked and if med-Med well would work. I agreed that's how I liked my food. It took quite a while for the food to come out and when it did my plate was cold, and my husbands was hot.The pasta has no seasoning or flavor to it, but the noodles you can tell are possibly hand made and good.My salmon was over cooked, no flavor at a and cold, which was a huge bummer to me. It came with cauliflower and a sauce on it.Over all I would not recommend anyone coming here. The bill ended up being $71 for food we could have made ourselves."}, {"review_id": "lAV9mPf2FMk-dXtvzeXi5Q", "user_id": "c9agK_ZTBwqWn1hE7V7dyg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "A place for high-end cocktails and excellent food set in a lively, elegant atmosphere. I have been to Eastern Standard about 10 or so times and have always been impressed. Overall I would rate the cocktails 5 stars and the food 3.5-4. I have yet to experience a better place in Boston for consistent, innovative and delicious cocktails. I am particularly impressed by their egg/egg-white based drinks. The mixologists are well-versed and always have recommendations for subtle variations and new concoctions. Food-wise, Eastern Standard delivers consistent, solid New-American cuisine. The pricing is as would be expected with main courses in the $24-30 range. On a recent night out I ordered the Maine Salmon. The fish was cooked excellently, medium-rare, and served with a nice squash puree. Our table had the butterscotch bread pudding for dessert which was warm and delicious. If you are looking for a lively night out, be it with friends or a date, Eastern Standard offers an overall excellent experience."}, {"review_id": "S6JD0FmdDcOKoyyc0uXLnw", "user_id": "75EVFWNFhPeCojuj2DoOXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Garrett, you have hired and inspired the best in the business !     Everyone in ES is 5 star ..... tonight we had touchpoints with Sebastion, Paige, and Conor.  Conor is a star.   He hustles without sweating.   His eyes are everywhere but also focused on individual needs.  He care about his co workers.   He not only thanked Vanessa for cleaning a spill, but also helped her."}, {"review_id": "GAygC3LeR7pnJowbxPvoxg", "user_id": "YGcUF64YqnvQb9kwGLth2A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "Great location, cool vibe and good service. I really liked sitting at the bar and watching the bartenders do their thing. The food was just okay. The wine was great, plus they have little half bottles!!I enjoyed the half bottle Mayacamas Chardonnay (2014)- delicious. Paired with the salmon and brussel sprouts. Salmon was a bit over done with decent flavor. The brussel sprouts were large and fresh, but not nearly as blackened and crispy as I would like (to each his/her own!).I returned the next day for dinner (it was next to my hotel..) and tried the Steak Frites and subbed macaroni for fries. Steak was ok- nothing to write home about. The macaroni and cheese is a huge serving and pretty tasty, but beware it is a STRONG cheese (not your standard cheese)."}, {"review_id": "BwjxwdUK1bC7-NF3fTwgcQ", "user_id": "3aUjjC7KzF-uOg7isjHUYQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Great late night snack and drinks place.

I came here once in the summer for drinks just for drinks/people watching. I got the rose, which was excellent. Very prompt service.I also came for brunch in the fall and it was just as nice to sit outside - they bring out very strong heated lamps (and I'm someone who gets cold easily!). I got the eggs in purgatory and a Bloody Mary. The eggs in purgatory was good, poached eggs were done just right so that the yolk runs when you pierce it. However, the portion is not big and you'll probably still be hungry afterwards. The bloody mary was pretty good! I'm usually not a fan of bloody marys because they usually put too much horseradish sauce into it, and this one was more light-handed with it. I got it with a 50/50 mixture of house vegetable and habanero vodka and it was pretty spicy already. Overall, excellent quality of food with great service and ambiance."}, {"review_id": "mjjFnDOsuSEfbxlZUX051Q", "user_id": "LOsNYJiTc_g93rVM__guiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I eat the same thing every time I go here.Eggs Benedict with a well done English muffinVery well done home fries ---which are fresh real potato wedges ---excellent!!It was my families Easter brunch---such a wonderful setting in such a nostalgic old style Restuarant ----absolutely fantastic.Even the coffee taste better here.Their menu is quite unique with mussels and clams.

This was my 3rd/4th time here and it was just fabulous as always. I used to order their moscow mules everytime but they have discontinued serving them in the copper jars which kind of kills half the fun so will be sticking to wine. I believe their other cocktails are great too. We ordered the cheese plate and the calamari. Both decent along with our drinks. Its a great date spot as well. It is pricey so be willing to shell out the big bucks but its always a good time, so i dont mind. Their servers are courteous and their service is relaxed.

The roasted bone marrow app was delish. Loved how they added hen of the woods mushroom to the dish.My gf had the baked rigatoni and i had the ribeye. The rigatoni was yummy but filling. The ribeye was fatty goodness. Although i can do without the blue cheese butter. The waitress was very generous with her wine pours for my girlfriend. Her 2 glasses were more like 5 glasses of wine. In addition, for the bread pudding dessert, they wrote out happy birthday which was nice of them.

It's definitely a little more pricey, but you're paying for great quality food.

The staff are very friendly and attentive. Some of my favorite food recommendations include the polenta (lunch), grilled cheese sandwich (lunch and dinner), the burger (lunch and dinner), the desserts are all delicious, and they have one of the best hot chocolates I've ever had. I haven't had it myself, but I've gone with people who love their seafood and claim it's some of the best in Boston.All in all it's definitely worth trying!

The food is good, service is solid, and the ambiance (it truly is beautiful) is great, but when combined, it does not create a 5 star experience for me (I simply think there is slightly better food around in the category that I would put them into). I will say that they make some great cocktails - so they do get some brownie points here. I do also like the half bottle of wine options. I would say that to improve, Easter Standard should maybe try to be a little daring in their menu choices. When we were there last (not sure what has changed), nothing seemed to stand out and a lot of it seemed basic and not out of this world.
