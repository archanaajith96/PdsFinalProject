Valerie started us off with Bloody Marys that we're just the right amount of spicy to be perfect!My husband was unsure what he wanted for breakfast and Valerie suggested the Eggs Benedict which had corned beef hash underneath and was delicious ! I had the hash and red onion omelette which was not only cooked to perfection but definitely enough to feed 2! The service was wonderful, friendly and warm from the moment we walked in. If you're looking for someplace different for breakfast give them a try you won't be sorry."}, {"review_id": "2w8s72Z4iDaYHkKyzULi-w", "user_id": "1i9qqhUqn_1eR5bj3LKCYA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Each year around St. Patrick's Day my elderly mother, my family and I go out for an Irish meal in memory of my father, a bona fide Irishman. We miss him so much. We tried this place two years ago and the food was horrible so we crossed it off our list, but a neighbor told my mother that it had changed ownership and we should give it another try. So, tonight, we did. I would review the food, but the problem is that we had a terrible experience with the pierced, tattooed woman who was sadly assigned to us as our waitress. Please, I have nothing against tattoos or piercings, but I do have a problem with mean, snarky, rude waitresses! I won't go into detail, but my impression is that the happiest people here are indifferent and the unhappiest people here are, well, embodied by the nasty woman who ruined what could have been a lovely evening. A few samples of her behavior:1. I would like the reuben, but with turkey instead of corned beef...Mean Waitress: We don't HAVE turkey.2. I am here with my elderly mom and the music you are playing (70's headbanging, acid rock, and loud!) is not quite what we expected. It's actually really kind of awful. I was wondering if you might play something else, perhaps some Irish music?,,,,Mean Waitress: This is a jukebox selection (I honestly don't see a jukebox anywhere), so somebody paid for it so I can't very well turn it off because they paid for it (duh) and we always just play classic rock. It's what we play. Me: Gee, thanks so much for your gracious response...3. She finally just sent another waitress over to finish up. The new waitress was just fine. So, in my mind, whether the food was good or not is irrelevant, because even if it was James Beard worthy, who'd want to deal with crap music and a waitress with a really bad attitude?It's true - one bad apple DOES spoil the whole bunch. Never again. RIP, Shannon View Inn. I am sure the employment market is tough, but until you hire some friendly, kind staffers, this family will never again darken the door of the Shannon View Inn. A sad, sad experience."}, {"review_id": "c9grbiDC9nu53RMUPJY2Rw", "user_id": "r1NU8pUS_Gf3FLt_Fj_Ytw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "I went here today for the first time to get some breakfast and I wasn't super impressed.

Less than a mile from my hotel, this was the perfect choice for a good meal and a delicious craft beer! I had the Reuben with fried along with a Wachusett Octoberfest Ale and couldn't have been more satisfied with my choice. The Irish pub was full of locals and business travelers all gathered to the backdrop of a cozy pub with plenty of TV's to watch sports. It was also trivia night, which is always a good way to unwind. The music between questions was right up my alley, playing a mix of 80's & 90's Alternative Rock. I greatly enjoyed my evening at Shannon View Inn.If you're in the Providence area but don't feel like making the drive to Federal Hill or Downtown, stop by Shannon View Inn for some comfort food and relax!"}, {"review_id": "JFpf-sE5NUR5JcQF8cGj7w", "user_id": "8HfsL_1Ne6ldx3dyvMWu6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Stopped in here for a quick bite while I was in Warwick RI, right down the street from the airport.  When I arrived it was quiet and service was great.  The BLT was fantastic and the extra $2 for a side salad is definitely a better option than the fries.  Then 5:30 hit and it seemed like the floodgates opened. The overwhelmed bartender who seemed to be the only one serving at the time could have used some help. There was another staff member sitting at the bar I'm not sure if she was on her break or her shift had not started but maybe you might want extra staff on during peak times. The food was great but I bolted out of there as soon as I noticed I would be lost in the crowd."}, {"review_id": "ld7oTr0UcOTeJqKy6d0_vA", "user_id": "8aj0ms7u9QsH2aD-C04daA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Wish I could comment on the food but I Sat there and was ignored for 15 minutes without ever placing an order.  Not even a beverage order.  Got up and left.  Horrible service!!!!"}, {"review_id": "ZRmqiDf1a1TkIOTrVa_2TQ", "user_id": "VQy7vcxbxAr5b9IyZ-InzA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "Good food at reasonable prices.  Attentive servers.
