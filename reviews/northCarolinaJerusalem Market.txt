I was under the impression that you could order food and eat there, but other than one little 2 person table, there's no dining area. We opted to drive downtown and go to the restaurant, but we had a lot of fun shopping here and I got some neat candies to take home to the family.

They had different chocolates, spices, candy bars, dried fruit, and any kind of traditional dishes that you would like to take with you. In the back however there was a deli sandwiches  and a few sides  and some desserts like baklava. My friend and I mainly roamed around this part just so we could see all the different things that they had to offered. We definitely left with a wide array of chocolate bars. The owner checking us out was the sweetest after he saw that we were just buying candy bars he offered to slide us two more so that we could know what his favorite was. Love this place! I could be in there for hours and just explore."}, {"review_id": "faCuPgPuPFPeZe2XH4z3pQ", "user_id": "28p8NK5687A5MzEOB4w2Qg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/25/2017", "text": "Not really a restaurant.

The sandwiches are absolutely fantastic, I indulged in the Turk, I got two since they are quite small in quantity but make up in quality. I really like the pickles and the pita chips. It is hard to get lost on the way there since the new highway exit just opened, just keep left on gate city and you shall get there.And on the other hand the size is deceiving, it does fill you up!"}, {"review_id": "weCIu145W3OdxrquAcVTww", "user_id": "SJgyVQ09-IrF4rbmoEnPyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "I just visited this place and the food was fantastic.....I had the Armenian wrap, hummus with pita chips....Everything was fresh and delicious!

The owner and his family are always super friendly and ready to answer any questions you may have. Everything they make in the deli is delicious. My favorite is The Turk. They always ask if you want onions & hot sauce (shatta) on your sandwich. Definitely say YES to both. They also have wonderful cold salads. My favorites are the foul (fūl), hummus, and the potato salad!Aside from the deli is a tiny middle-eastern grocery store selling canned goods, spices, snacks, candy and tea. They have an assortment of bulk dried fruits, candies, and nuts for sale by the pound in jars as soon as you walk in. Don't forget the Turkish Delight!The Jerusalem Market is a wonderful hidden treasure! Stop by for lunch and you will be coming back for more!"}, {"review_id": "EzuDMJ6tWduHOSEqJseVVA", "user_id": "BKuuWttdfhekYpq-Z3naiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/26/2016", "text": "This is a review for the new restaurant downtown. I was in town for furniture market and got to my hotel late. My assistant and I walked out looking for something to eat and stumbled in. They greeted us and told us they were having a friends and family preview night and weren't open - but then proceeded to invite us to come in and help ourselves to food. The generosity of spirit is matched by the quality of the food. I only wish I were in town more than twice a year. I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "W3772mfXqTsMQPQHSgTI_w", "user_id": "a32bDLnYc8Qx31VcKSGP6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "I rarely can be bothered to write reviews, but this place was that good. I wish there had been more of us dining so I could have ordered and tried more things.

I could spend a half day in here just lookin' around at all the stuff they have. I won't rewrite what all the other reviewers have already written about the place, just stop by and check them out, it's great. The organic cold pressed olive oil here is the real deal and top notch, I'll be getting my oil here from now on fo-sho. I haven't tried anything from the deli counter in the back yet, but the items they prepare look & sound great. My dad's a bit of a chocolate freak, so last week when I stopped here I racked up on some of the awesome candies they stock, got all my Fathers Day shopping done here in one shot, great place to do a little gift shoppin'. I bought for myself this little Milka chocolate bar that had a strawberry yogurt filling, that little jewel is crazy good, Milka ROCKS!!!"}, {"review_id": "Eyb9b_o3VhRuWzPGQD5PyA", "user_id": "0bK3TZ7h2llC0HR4kNzPGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "Great food in both locations.

I actually had to look up what falafel was before ordering it. I am more of a burger man. I did enjoy the falafel wrap, however. Falafel has the texture of fried chicken crust, which I had to get used to. There isn't a crunch, but a mush texture. I did enjoy the lunch, despite having to get used to these new things. The menu isn't huge, but there is plenty to pick from if, like me, you may want a safer selection. The rest of the market was very nice, and a great place to find those hard to locate middle eastern ingredients."}, {"review_id": "03YNS1ucMPkFsgC283R-fw", "user_id": "siKO_ccP3f6aN8qrKYeClQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/17/2017", "text": "Great little place in what seems like the middle of nowhere.

I went in for a quick lunch and was not disappointed!I ordered Falafel and really liked it! I only have it when I go to New York, mainly because I haven't seen/looked for local places that offer it.This one was the best so far. Light, yet filling! Fresh, warm, crunchy, all rolled into one. Accompanied by a small olive and pickle on the side. The place is on the smaller end, so I recommend ordering your food first! (go straight to the back) then walk around and explore the little market which is jam packed with goodies. I love these unique, cultural places- you can shop around AND get a great lunch! Definitely recommend it if you are looking for something different. Good for vegetarian meals. \"It's so tasty too.\"- L.B. :D"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/jerusalem-market-greensboro?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
