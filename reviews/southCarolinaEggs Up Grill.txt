The service is always incredibly friendly and often, they will get to know you by name or remember what you're into for breakfast.  The food is even better and super customizable. Want one egg cooked one way and another cooked differently? no problem. Want your waffle to be sweet potato, but without nuts? no problem? Want to chat with your server who has bacon and eggs earrings in? No problem -- she's got the recommendations on deck!The food is always filling and of high quality. I recommend getting the home fries and if you're into doing lots of carbs in one meal--a sweet potato waffle. You will love it! Oh, and on weekends they are always busy, but they give you coffee while you wait and you can check in on Yelp to put yourself in line."}, {"review_id": "fYjzDpcpeNQd7m5I7GYotw", "user_id": "8OZEER43TDga3_tXSkJckA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "This was my second trip to Eggs Up, and Kelsay's first... and we have nothing but great things to say!Kelsay got the \"Slices, Strips and Spuds\" plate that features two slices of french toast, home fries and bacon. I got the \"Fruited Plain\" which is french toast topped with fresh strawberries, blueberries and bananas. Let me tell you, the french toast here is some of the best we've had in Columbia. It's thick and really has a great cinnamon flavor, and once you slap some syrup on there it's a done deal!Kelsay loved the home fries, and I was jealous I didn't have any myself. Overall the service was fast, and everything that hit the table was fresh!We definitely recommend Eggs Up Grill, and we will be featuring them on our instagram page @redplatespecial !"}, {"review_id": "XtHcSX0O3EJEhb8ntPrHrw", "user_id": "67TJhVdELf8_CXWoR6Yd7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Fast service, friendly staff.  The food is pretty good, but the coffee is so watered down.  This lost them a star.Well I have bee back twice since my last  review and the coffee has noticably improved!"}, {"review_id": "bdfqcswiz9pqkjG9c9F3Rg", "user_id": "0n7kXbA5oAac1e7ngX0D6A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "A friend of mine referred to this place as a dive...  it's a chain. It looks, smells, tastes of a chain. The food is average and mediocre at best. You can get just as good a breakfast at ihop or Denny's. The customer service will also leave you wanting more. After hearing all the hype I was expecting great things... it did not live up to the hype. At all. Not even close.

The oyster roast and ballet brought us into town yesterday, so I was excited to try this place on the way back to Augusta. First off, Rachel, the server was great. I let her pick between the regular eggs benedict and the tomato Florentine one and surprise me. She chose the original and I'm happy she did. It was delicious. The home fries were, as well. This is actually another corner of Columbia I haven't visited and liked the drive in from downtown. The other two friends I was with enjoyed their breakfast and both said they would be back. Augusta really needs to up their breakfast game. Between this and OHOP, we will just have to start taking turns between the two when we make the trip to Columbia, which is becoming more often. Will be back to try more!"}, {"review_id": "gOLeqefwO_Dg3NgwbLvIGA", "user_id": "dhF-BtaM62hDPUXEqIAyMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "This surprising brunch spot had lots to offer. At first glance, it doesn't look like it'd be as big as it is based off the outside, but the interior decor was spacious and clean. Parking is a bit limited based off how many people can actually fit in the restaurant. On a Sunday morning, there was quite a line outside, but thankfully, I was able to add myself onto the waiting list from the yelp app. You're immediately seated from there and provided drinks. The service was amazing and the workers seem to be happy working there. I ordered the steak and eggs with grits and there famous Cuppo Cacao, which is half coffee and half cocoa mix. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, so I preferred more of the chocolatey taste. I ordered a medium steak and got medium rare, but the flavor made up for it. It was perfectly seasoned! The toast was great-- the perfect slather of butter, and a hint of garlic and salt. Overall, the experience was great for a brunch spot. I will definitely be revisiting."}, {"review_id": "QnUpRLgn8WBxap0vfe1Riw", "user_id": "RJK9Cfu7B2AJkCJuCzv_OA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Excellent service and quick.  The eggs Benedict was good, a little light on the hollandaise sauce.  The home fries were very good, the omelette my daughter ordered was light and fluffy with a good amount of mix ins.  The Philadelphia omelette used a velveta cheese instead of provolone or even shredded cheese. The corned beef hash was good.  Good for a sit down meal with the family."}, {"review_id": "3Xmo44n37P-8uiyZSfs1lg", "user_id": "j5n2vW0uWyElU4YkPD9PXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "I'm gluten free and had a great experience here!

I am amazed Columbia! Food is not fresh.Food comes from a Sysco frozen food truck (therefore GMO and bad quality ingredients).The dishes are pathetic - they lack any soul and energy behind them. I ordered eggs and potatoes and everything came out wrong. Eggs were bland and potatoes were mushy when they should have been crispy.It's really sad, this and 2 other spots are the only brunch places Columbia has. WAFFLE HOUSE is infinitely better than this place. You will literally get the EXACT SAME FOOD but for less money and better execution. Don't believe me? Sounds absurd? Go here and see for yourself. The only difference is you'll wait 1 hour at 1 pm on a Sunday at this place for some uninspiring boring bland egg dish.

I made an initial post and promised to the end result. I ordered the Sweet Potato Waffle and grits. This was truly delicious, the syrup that came with the waffle was delicious! My waffle was nice, fluffy, and the ends were crunchy (just how I like it)! My grits were delicious as well, not too buttery at all. The customer service was on point from beginning to end. Trust me when I tell you I will be a returning customer especially since I am most importantly huge on customer service. Everyone that was having brunch woh me enjoyed their meals as well and even ate some of my food. Yeah it doesn't take a lot for me to get full.
