Fantastic family business!!!"}, {"review_id": "zYwUyIWNuT7oqXXVUVFLWA", "user_id": "iJzsRe1GjVkQbuhWWiAdWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "The staff is extremely beautiful! The food will make your mouth like the Phoenix exploding out of the fire! I feel like they import the pizza from Chicago or New York... cappy's is behind the world's first teleportation device.

The sauce is Tangy and robust, the sausage large and flavorful, and the toppings plentiful.  I will definitely be back to the place many times while I'm in town, and maybe even when I'm not, it is worth the drive, from anywhere.."}, {"review_id": "kVJ_1Kt_m1F7c_CYc4fTKg", "user_id": "wiLTri1tSya5U5oe80wI-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/29/2016", "text": "Funky pizza place in an unlikely location. Solid selection of brews, but the pizzas...Ahhh the pizza. I can't speak to the Chicago style, but the New York thin has a delicious crackly crust. Fresh tasting ingredients and sauce.

The music and menus are fun too!"}, {"review_id": "PeSIaJCPpnCbgUQc_uqPqg", "user_id": "zmqn0KeAxQTJJXljR7nhww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "Okay so me and my boyfriend were looking for a cool place to eat that we have never had before.

Once I walked through the door and the smell of pizza hit my nose, I knew that I made the correct decision. Cappy's has a cool laid back vibe. You can help yourself to their beer fridge and they will charge to whatever you pick out. The staff was very nice and provided excellent service. The Chicago style pizza was exactly what I was looking for. It took a while to prepare, but that's to be expected from the style. The pizza was tasty and very filling. It was a little on the expensive side. $18.25 for a small Cappy's (think a supreme pizza). But they were generous with the toppings and was a good enough value. I would come back, but I'd try their New York style pizza next time."}, {"review_id": "4wV0liB5Uw-hj4j8kF1jFg", "user_id": "sCzOiPDxMtLV8mP7MC92gQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "We love this place, but my wife and I think the crust has changed.

Oh, and delicious Chicago-style pizza. Just off of C Avenue, behind Scooter's, the place serves New York, Chicago, and calzone pies. The only drawback is, that they do not have enough seating to serve the people. Wait times can sometimes be pretty long.

Nice ambiance, very low key. We were seated within minutes of arrival. The wait staff were meticulous with cleaning off the table before we sat. We looked around and all of the pizzas looked so good on all the tables around us. The waitress we had was very friendly and attentive. Now to the good stuff. We ordered a large (16\") plain cheese NY style pizza. It came out of the oven super quick and we dove in. People, this is some seriously good pizza. Everything you'd want in a pizza, gooey cheese, light sauce, and a nice chewy crust. We devoured it in record time. I will definitely be back here again."}, {"review_id": "09JYpqLx4E8cgjtkdqbi-g", "user_id": "FaWCKiJyBhBEWiT2wB4NQQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/13/2015", "text": "I am so disappointed.  When I first had cappy's pizza, I was so happy.  The Cappy beat out even Tomaso's Mombo Combo, which is quite a feat in my eyes.Unfortunately, as the months went by, I feel like the quality of this pizza place has gone down. The first offense was takeout where the crust was black, and I mean burnt to a crisp and tasted bad.  I've had takeout where I got home and the pizza had been hilariously tipped to the side so all the ingredients were only baked on maybe a fourth of the pizza (the cheese was still there so I know they saw it and it didn't move in the car) and the last time I was there, we waited quite awhile for a pizza that was soggy.  The server said that there was something wrong with the new baker and a lot of dough had just been turning out that way.  Yuck.  I would have had to eat it with a spoon; I am not exaggerating.If Cappy's can get back on the level they were when they opened, I would go back, but honestly there's enough good pizza places in Cedar Rapids unless someone else buys it for me, I'm probably not going to try it again. Why waste time and money?"}, {"review_id": "IrISQ1KZUIksASuoIV72IA", "user_id": "9hQ0NCGCasQTzH9HiV8Wow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/1/2016", "text": "We decided to try Cappy's pizza as we were looking for a sit down pizza restaurant when we were in Cedar Rapids.

They also have a good Gluten Free pizza too (a must for my wife).
