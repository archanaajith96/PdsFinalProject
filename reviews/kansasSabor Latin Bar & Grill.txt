You could say it's a version of Latin food, with all the details that make it great missing. We ordered the paella which was just food placed on a bowl of seasoned rice... it was not cooked in paella style and was completely missing the crispy rice (socarrat) bottom that defines this dish. The pupusas were acceptable, but at $16 for 2, they were no better than the ones we get for $1.50 each in Charlotte. The fish tacos were again merely acceptable and what the deemed 'black bean mouse' was just refried black beans.  The portions were good, just overpriced for the quality of food."}, {"review_id": "YUt4nIliUXAjUKvd2SaB0Q", "user_id": "n024hqmFFUIRIfP2heQ3AA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Love the variety of food from numerous Latin-American countries.

The minute we opened the front door and smelled the delicious aroma I knew we struck gold. From the decor, to the waitress to the incredible menu and best of all taste of the food. I'm learning if a restaurant can pull off a vegetarian dish as this one did it will be a winner. I'd give it 6 stars if I could."}, {"review_id": "WChaNUr0hrb2RPd5jAsfTw", "user_id": "xToMHNl-tLagY4ccNFF4CQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "AWe had dinner at Sabor and it was amazing!!!!

My Husband and I really really enjoyed our experience and dinner tonight. Great location downtown Wichita with easy parking. We had Ryan for our server and he gave us excellent service! The queso and corn appetizer which was so very tasty. And we shared the meat plate for two. I wish we had a little more time in town so we could eat there again. The medley of sauces that came with our plate of meats were all great and different. At least we have leftovers for tomorrow. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a couples night out or dinner with friends. Their mojitos are really tasty as well."}, {"review_id": "hV6DH0GeOddOI4c1RJuEEw", "user_id": "nfNbBaIFhBIcbWPXP7XyYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "If you are looking for a great meal this is the place only in town once a year for short time and never disappointed!

My favorites include their queso with corn, sancocho soup, paella, the parilla plate for two, cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes, and the arepas. You can't forget dessert, the churros and tres leche cake are so good.  The staff is always friendly, the restaurant clean and open and great for for a night out. Make a reservation though if you're dining in the evening, they can fill up!"}, {"review_id": "l_rclSNAev5z_m5uIi3cZQ", "user_id": "1tpydgN_7-D4e7uc2iG9FQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/4/2016", "text": "We came to Sabor for a birthday. It's located in Old Town in Wichita near the old town Warren. The staff is extremely friendly and professional. If this review was based on service only it would be a 5 star rating. We made reservations a few days prior and seated fairly quickly when we arrived. The decor was very welcoming and trendy. They have a wide variety of cocktails- from cosmos to mojitos and more. For an appetizer we ordered the Platanutres (plantain chips with avocado crema)...which was very delicious. It came with a chimichurri sauce and was amazing!For my meal I ordered the Beef Tenderloin Medallions which was around $24 I believe. Most of the items were priced between $14 and $26...I was a little disappointed given the high price, because I felt the taste didn't match the price honestly. Everyone at the table pretty much agreed. The steak just wasn't very flavorful. Also, they do not have a kids menu. Maybe we'll be back to try some of the lower priced items and try some different items off the menu."}, {"review_id": "KHwdYrbtVoVY3Uu6VpG35w", "user_id": "ThyjOXkkUNrrN1m7Mxh66w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "I had a really great dinner here, I would recommend!

We elected to dine in the more casual outdoor seating area... it was a beautiful evening in Sept and we enjoyed the fountain view. The Indoor seating was more posh/formal.  We started with coconut shrimp appetizer which was perfectly phenomenal.  For entree, my sister had the plantain & pumpkin seed encrusted mahai mahai w/ corn tomato salsa and cheddar risotto. I had the beef medallions topped w/ crispy fried onions, and served with asparagus and avocado pasta.

Service was fantastic and very polite and friendly. The starters were served quickly and all our drinks were delicious. My mother especially liked the Pink Flamingo. We had the Queso and it was more than enough for 7 of us. I had the Cobb salad and my wife had a sirloin served with green beans. The salad was fantastic with great flavor and it came with a whole chicken breast on top. My wife's sirloin was cooked medium and was perfect. It had great flavor and was plenty for her to have leftovers. The green beans were delicious as well. Overall a fantastic experience and we will be back for sure. *My wife is gluten free and Sabor had plenty of selections for her to choose from."}, {"review_id": "oSY3FZzGt94gBUxIy8KUKw", "user_id": "NlTZhHJKuhvirYJ7wLGbgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Loved this place.
