We ordered one of the lamb curries and asked for mild spicy - big portion, really tasty with so many great spices. We also had the paneer masala, also mild spicy,  which was just excellent - cheese was fresh and the curry sauce on point. Topped off the meal with chai teas.Aside from the amazing food the service was just as amazing. Very kind and attentive staff. Will definitely be back when I'm around Manchester"}, {"review_id": "PbRWGx9c5V2KEO7m02j8OA", "user_id": "l0U0PfzzVMm9s4KshP6T0w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "This was a near perfect a first visit as you can get. I had been here at whatever Indian place occupied it many years ago, but this was my first visit back since they had changed over. The inside was immaculate, front door to bathrooms, with big windows to let in the light, plenty of room between tables so you're not in cramped quarters despite the smaller size and none of the hokey decorations a lot of places use, just some  appropriate pictures. The food came out quickly for the amount we had ordered and we made out way through perfectly cooked naan, delicious coconut soup and meals of veggie vindaloo and chicken tikka masala. The spice level was just what we had asked for and the food was cooked perfectly. The service was great and we were well attended to the entire meal by our waiter for drinks and getting the check. The prices were very reasonable, with dinner prices ranging anywhere from $11 to $16. They also offer a buffet every day for lunch if that's your thing. It'a always good to have another solid Indian option in the area and I'll definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "y_uMoK-iCEnFkBbhioWwjQ", "user_id": "_kY-D2OD3WXpOsKNkXbEsQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "The service was terrible, half way thru the meal our server disappeared.  They tried to over charge us for part of the meal that came as a combo as individual items.  Be very careful with your receipt, and review carefully. Seemed pretty shady they offer a combo then tell us (although it's on the menu still) that the items were a separate charge. Also the dish they bring when you sit with 3 sauces and a cracker/chip I'm going to call it  \"the Nepali version of chips and salsa\"- does come free but FYI if you want extra of any sauces or cracker / chips there will be a 2.99$plus surcharge.The food was decent, and fast.

I can't adequately express in words how insanely delicious everything was. The flavors are intense and well-balanced. I got mild or medium level spice, which would be medium or hot in general American terms. Perfectly fine with me. A few of the dishes I had were chicken chili, goat biyrani, chicken tikki masala, saag paneer, chicken saag, and of course garlic naan. I'm considering getting one takeout dish (chicken chili is my leading candidate) and splitting it for four or five lunches for work. They are that big and the aroma will make everyone jealous. The delivery I got included the three pre-meal dips and tortilla-like cracker. Nice touch. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They love talking about their delicious creations."}, {"review_id": "YrjQRE6fCuG4LehdJFrbBg", "user_id": "woj0pRhcjW51MJUNh6hflg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Enjoyed the food and service...flavors were different than other places which made it even more delicious!!!

The business was out of pakoras and chicken tandoori when I got seated, chicken got replenished in 5 minutes and gone before I could get any. Waiting 10+ minutes on pakoras and still none. Noticed one cook on a cell phone, still on it 10 minutes later...which can explain the lack of food in part but there are 2 other cooks.Food on the warming line is lukewarm, health inpectors take note that the heating elements were never lit when I was there, how can you possibly keep food at a safe temp? At least the somewhat tired looking saag paneer has flavor. Potato and cauliflower curry - cauliflower is still rock hard, not close to being cooked; I told the waiter and it's still sitting out there. Chili chicken looks like it's been around for a long time, never was replenished and not worth risking a bite. Pakoras - mushroom - finally came and at least they are good. Decent mint / coriander chutney,  onion chutney good too. They bring bread to your table and it's hot and good, oil still dripping off it.Tandoori chicken got replenished and I got a couple small pieces, hot and juicy but lacked flavor. Bang! waiter dropping utensils when clearing a table. And the place is far from packed.Chicken tikka masala sauce tasted average, nothing special here, there were only 3 small pieces of chicken swimming in at least 1/3 gallon of tepid sauce. After telling the waiter, they brought me a small bowl with some nice pieces of chicken in tikka masala sauce, and it was hot food. Went back for more saag paneer but there was only one piece of saag looking forlorn in that more tired spinach.Won't be back. Maybe the head chef wasn't there when I was eating, but whoever was there wasn't serving good food or much food. They need to get the chafing lamps lit, too, that's a big potential health issue"}, {"review_id": "YBnDVD6fT_aeaf7j2Jh-rA", "user_id": "0WOFLA3aEhO4aM4UY5vRlw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "The food is good ...

All dishes were very fresh (could be hotter) and had very nice flavors. The buffet had fresh salad appetizers, pakoras, rice, tikka Marsala, paneer saag, chicken tandoori and so much more. The lentil soup was very good, as well as the garlic nann. The service was very friendly! The mango pudding dessert was very sweet and delish. A few small things worth mentioning- -No small sauce dishes for the sauces- we had to use the soup bowls. - No lemon slices on the buffet! :-( -No soup spoons- or they were hard to find at least.

We had dinner there last night after lamenting that our old 'go to' central Asian restaurants had become less than worth the money. We googled ethnic restaurants in Manchester after getting out of a late medical appointment . Found this on line with some good reviews and thought 'what the heck'. We LOVED this place. We had Nepalese dishes- Allo Bodi Tama Soup, Rayko Ko Saag, and the Nepalese vegetarian Thali. It was all more than we could have expected. Similar to Indian but with subtle differences in flavor, ingredients. We had ours spiced Mild since it was late in the evening and the spice was just right. Flavors insanely delicious. The meat eaters menu is extensive and still plenty for vegetarians.Service was excellent and friendly. Staff are obviously well educated and gentile but not stuffy.  Portions generous. Clean and simple decor but charming ambience. Easy to get to (in the plaza with DMV and the closed Shaws right behind A Market) and plenty of parking. The chef (Owner?) came out to greet us and ask about our experience- where do you get this service anymore?Price was right- $45 for pappadum with chutneys, 2 soups, Thali, one other entrée with rice and we came home with lunch for today.The take out menus are now in our cars so we can call ahead for take out when we are in the area. The phone number is programmed into our cell phones. This is our NEW GO TO PLACE!

The downside is we arrived after 2 pm and they were just about to shut down the buffet. Some of the dishes were on the dry side and others were just warm instead of hot.

The food is excellent and the menu has both Indian and Nepali items. The staff is friendly and very attentive. This restaurant is located in my neighborhood and is surrounded by quite literally dozens of other restaurants. I prefer to patronize Kathmandu owing to the excellent quality. Highly recommended are the traditional momos, any of the curry dishes and, my personal favorite, the Tandoori mixed grille. It doesn't really matter what you choose, however, you will not be disappointed. They also serve wonderful beers like Kingfisher and Lucky Buddha which are largely unavailable elsewhere in the city. Finally, as someone with food allergies, I appreciate their genuine help with food selection and the sincerity of their concern.

It is as good if not better than places I've been in Boston and NYC. The lunch buffet is an amazing value and always has a great selection. The Naan is served fresh every time, perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. The spiced and stuffed Naans are done perfectly too- just the right amount of flavor without overdoing it. I find it difficult to make a dinner recommendation, as I have tried just about everything on both their menus and have yet to find something less than stellar. Any of the goat or lamb dishes are always a huge hit- the flavor of the goat with bone is so robust. The sauces are always perfectly seasoned and appropriately rich. The \"medium\" spice is pretty darn spicy for the average American palate, so keep that in mind when ordering. If I had to pick a favorite dish here it would be the Nepalese Fish Curry. A very generous portion of perfectly cooked firm chunks of swordfish (yes, delicious fresh swordfish!) cooked in a fragrant curry over basmati rice, it really is a standout dish.  Don't forget some tandoori mixed grill and pakoras.Home run from start to finish. Great portions at a fair price for the absolutely incredible quality... go in with high expectations and you will still be blown away."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/kathmandu-spice-manchester?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
