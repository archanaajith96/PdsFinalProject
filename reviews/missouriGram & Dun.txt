When restaurant week rolled around, my friend and I immediately made plans for dinner here.For my appetizer I ordered the goat salad. The goat salad was pretty good, but nothing special. While I liked the herbed goat cheese more than I thought, I enjoyed my entree and dessert much more. My hanger steak entree was cooked a perfect medium rare and was paired nicely with seasoned potatoes and mushrooms. Overall, a great classic meat and potatoes type of dish! Dessert ended on a sweet note with the Gram & Dun Bar. To my surprise, this dessert was the highlight of my night. I especially enjoyed the salted caramel. While it was a small part of the dish, I thought it added a nice sweet and salty component to the otherwise sweet dessert. All throughout dinner, my friend and I were treated very nicely. Our dishes were brought in a timely manner, and we were periodically checked on/had our drinks refilled. With great food and a lovely atmosphere, Gram & Dun is a perfect place for a date night or grabbing dinner with family/friends."}, {"review_id": "D2kP6vGMpFKTQACp4HBnlA", "user_id": "mauKzyigOG-IJN1EM3SQ1A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "My wife and I have enjoyed visits to Gram & Dun several times over the last few years... We enjoyed dinner with friends here during KC Restaurant Week, but usually we just come for dessert and drinks after an evening at Country Club Plaza. For our dinner visit we made a reservation and were seated immediately, but usually when we just pop in after dinner we never have a problem being seated quickly.The drink menu has great options and the desserts are tasty. I love the ambience and the beautiful fireside patio."}, {"review_id": "5kmic5bNITOYFTlolC5Hew", "user_id": "dYjq7knhdELnYlT-2RouOA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "I finally checked this place out after being on my list for so long! Overall, I'd say I had a good experience. My table shared the french onion appetizer, and it sounded better than it tasted. Bummer. But my potato gnocchi was out of this world good. Really good. I guess I'm getting to that age where I'm complaining about the noise level . . . well, here we are. It was really loud, especially for a weeknight. Service was pretty attentive and polite. The funniest incident of the night, by far, was a  ridiculous charge made to my friend's bill. She ordered a whiskey, and they asked her if she wanted the specialty ice. Sure, why not. So then her bill comes out, and she has this super petty charge of $1.50 for a cube of ice. We were dying. They picked the wrong girl, because she wasn't having it. She made sure the waiter knew he should let people know that specialty ice comes at a price.Next, the manager came out. Adding to the pettiness, instead of just taking the charge off of her bill, he asked her if she WANTED the charge off her bill. We all died a second time. I mean, it's $1.50, just take it off her bill, why are you coming to the table to talk about it? The whole thing was ridiculous. Make the whiskey price a little higher to absorb the cost or tack it on somewhere so that it just doesn't look so tacky to charge for ice. It was just bizarre."}, {"review_id": "QMcUH-LeGsoUAR8JbfxMIQ", "user_id": "mkwJtFIABb4B7-9X3oPpUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Been to Gram & Dun twice now, both for brunch. First time I went with my family and I was super impressed. We originally got three planks (chorizo, walnut & salmon), but ended up ordering another chorizo one because it was so delicious. My family got the Shrimp & Grits, BRB, and Burnt Ends Mac & Cheese, and I got the Tico hanger steak. Burnt Ends Mac & Cheese was amazing (I finished off what my brother couldn't eat) and so was the Shrimp & Grits. The Tico was rather unimpressive/unsatisfying, and while my sister enjoyed the BRB overall, she said the biscuits were pretty dry. My second trip I ordered the Krispy French Toast. Had this been my only experience with Gram & Dun, I probably would've rated it 3 stars at the most. Nothing about the french toast was krispy. It was a soggy mess which no syrup or berry-mint  compote (also, not that great) could save. Others who ordered biscuits also said they were rather dry. I'd like to go back for their happy hour sometime and maybe try some other dishes. The service both times has been great and the design feels super classy."}, {"review_id": "OvcHDOvh6t5aechpLcQwVg", "user_id": "yObKy2ZwJgWVUCwRk1RVaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "My fiancé and I flew into Kansas City from Houston and this place was recommended.  We had a great brunch with drinks and food that were all top notch.  Our waitress was awesome and even thanked us by giving us drink tickets for Southwest.

The environment was very boujee and felt very high class. I was like the girl from Pretty Woman while I sat there in jeans and a t-shirt. Food felt very expensive and fancy too, luckily we got it at restaurant week prices. I ordered the \"smoking dun\" drink, it tasted alright, just wish it was actually smoking since it was said to have smoked salt. Maybe I just misinterpreted the name...Only complaint was the service. Having not been to places this fancy before, I wish the server was more welcoming / checked up more often.

The bar area has a good view to the river and street, which not every restaurant has this kind of unique location. We ordered two dishes: Asian pork wing and chicken & waffles. Asian pork wing - crispy on the outside and very juicy inside. I really like the chili souse, which is sweet and a little bit spicy. Good appetizer to get !Chicken & waffles - it's combo of fried chicken and waffles. Nothing much to say about it. It's just a perfect dish if you are craving for a delicious and spicy fried chicken. Decent portion, recommend to share this dish if you aren't that hungry !Overall, this is a good restaurant to go to in the area."}, {"review_id": "fx6O0lKFs0wBk3rxC1PbYg", "user_id": "3it4-yd92g0fniTb5GwtCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "The chicken and waffles, chips and dip and toast options are amazing the shaved Brussels sprout salad is REALLY DRY (hence the four stars)- the salad gameNeeds to be stepped up."}, {"review_id": "GMZt36yHAesjixqR8hPdCQ", "user_id": "z6CJG99mAxIKQMT655PK0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/26/2017", "text": "This restaurant easily hits ALL of my top restaurant checkboxes on so many levels. So glad I was able to make it here for dinner on my business trip to Kansas City.*Service: Absolutely incredible. We made a reservation a few days before our arrival. Apparently, patio seating is first come first serve, so we made the decision to hold a table for 10 people inside instead. However, once we got there, our table was not ready so we had to hang out at the bar for 30 minutes. Which was fine, because our drinks came out quickly. *Starters: Once we were seated, to our surprise, the restaurant gave us FREE (2 orders) 'Asian Pig Wings' and FREE (2 orders) 'Not-So-Standard Potato Chips. Both were OUT.OF.THIS.WORLD. And to top it off, we didn't pay for it. Like, seriously!? *Entrees:- Burnt End Mac & Cheese: house bbq, fontina, pecorino, chicharrón crumble 22 (MY FAVORITE -- I would love to eat this everyday if I could)- Loaded Baked Potato Gnocchi: housesmoked bacon, cheddar curds, sour cream, chive 19 (PERFECTION)- Shrimp & Grits: blackened, jalapeño, avocado gravy 23 (THE FLAVOR WAS DIVINE)- Chicken & Waffles: honey butter, texas pete, maple syrup 22 (HUGE PORTION AND SUPER CRISPY)*Desserts: - Gram & Dun Bar: chocolate mousse, ganache, peanut nougat, salted caramel, pretzel, peanut butter cup ice cream (SO SO DELICIOUS AND WELL-BALANCED. THE FLAVOR WAS STELLAR).- Crack-er Jack: popcorn panna cotta, roasted oat & peanut crumble, salted caramel (SO FLUFFY AND SMOOTH)- Strawberry Profiterole: choux & strawberry gelato, raspberry ginger coulis, coconut gel, toasted coconut (LOVED IT)- Lemon Cloud: lemon mousse, curd, citrus shortbread, vanilla cream, basil gel, torched meringue (YUM. NOT MY FAV, BUT STILL GOOD.)If I could choose one restaurant in the United States to recommend to a friend, it would be Gram & Dun :) Truly so impressed."}, {"review_id": "ZwFxCQG6bpyL-wPzBDi-hg", "user_id": "6z9rcXC24kC6PhH1ffZ8_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Let's keep it real, I love all the Bread and Butter Concepts joints.

When dining in New American restaurants, you'd typically expect to find prime steaks and fish topped with fancy ingredients. Yes, Gram & Dun does have those things, but they also offer Asian-inspired fare (Asian Pig Wings, Pork Soba), comfort food (Chicken & Waffles, Shrimp & Grits), and an upscale spin on American classics (Burnt End Mac & Cheese, House Burger). I wish I could try everything on their intriguing menu, but had to settle with just 5 items:1. Asian Pig Wings: 4/5. Smoked pork with crispy sweet skin (note: not chicken wings)2. Burnt End Mac & Cheese: 3/5. It was good, but my complaint is that the pasta was overcooked.3. Chicken & Waffles: 5/5. Amazing. The waffle was standard but the chicken was perfectly seasoned and both of them went so well with the accompanying hot sauce and maple syrup. I'm usually not one for butter on waffles, but their butter has a sweetness to it that's divine.4. Beef Fat Fries: 2/5. They just tasted like normal fries to me.5. Gram & Dun Bar (dessert): 5/5. Chocolate mousse. Caramel. Peanut butter cup ice cream. Ganache. Nuff said.The service here was excellent. We had a pretty large group but our friendly waitress Jo and the rest of the staff took great care of us. Our glasses were always full, our finished plates were quickly taken away, and they were kind enough to throw a birthday candle on one of the desserts for the birthday boy at our table. Plus, they didn't kick us out after we sang a pitchy rendition of happy birthday."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gram-and-dun-kansas-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
