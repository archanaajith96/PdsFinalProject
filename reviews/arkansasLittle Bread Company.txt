The atmosphere is quite laid back and the outside dining area is hidden just enough to add to the relaxing vibe.

Their food is fresh and flavorful, with a little something for everyone on the menu. Their case always has various quiche and cakes. They serve an assortment of pastries, our favorite being the pecan sticky bun and strawberry pinwheel. Their breakfast sandwiches are savory goodness. Their patio is eclectically charming. For the cons:The indoor seating is small, only 6-7 tables, which would be fine, but this one guy takes up a 4 top every morning we have been there. He sits there for hours, long after he has eaten. During poor weather, people will be standing waiting on a table to sit, but he won't budge. Just sits there looking at phone or computer. Sometimes the staff is super friendly, other times they've been a bit abrasive.The breakfast potatoes are hit or miss. Sometimes they're super firm and not cooked through, other times they're burned."}, {"review_id": "Y4EyMzxneGKA8jYWi60jVg", "user_id": "cTGlqi9noFZpkf_Qv-mkTw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "Stopped by after going to the library with my toddler. I would give 5 stars but I did feel like my entrance \"cramped the style\" of this place- definitely a hipster hangout, and my 9 month preggo stroller pushing self did not fit in.  The clerk never came back after I signed the receipt to ask if I wanted a copy. However, I am so glad I went because I ate the best chocolate croissant of my life- and I don't think it's the pregnancy talking. Perfectly flakey pastry, heavenly chocolate center with a delicious chocolate drizzle. Their cherry cheesecake turnover was perfect too- not overly sweet, the perfect ratio of cheese to cherries wrapped in they same delectable flakey crust. I will be going back!"}, {"review_id": "FDtDmdw3nwcAD6lIG8Df2g", "user_id": "rldfReV7NweR2SHwIfCh8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I don't see any reason not to give this place Five  starsFast service easy line movement comes out the kitchen the way you request small space good folks and always people watching hard to pick breakfast or lunch"}, {"review_id": "Bo33v0qP2VsmAGseXvHMhg", "user_id": "4pU-kZLQK87gVpnFgA0vdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I adore the cream puffs and the garlic grilled cheese.

The house blend coffee was delectable with no astringency. The bagel and garden herb cream cheese was a perfect prequel to get me going for work. There are some good sandwich choices but some of the bread lacks heft and is surprising with bread playing an integral part in the name. Cookies are hard but taking them back to the office for a quick toss in the microwave to soften makes them good for an afternoon snack."}, {"review_id": "tM5jhtCxmBh-mhwC9y6Aug", "user_id": "1dy8IOXaZ7Lz7mXf5tFOKQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "They have flies.

Usually stop here to feed a sweet tooth. The turnovers are all phenomenal. Have tried the quiche before and they're rich with flavor, but other than the combination of veggies, it's not something you couldn't make at home- just tastes so much better when someone else makes it!  My favorite though is the giant cream puff! It's huge and more than enough for 2+ people to share. I will say though that if you want a variety of their items to choose from then you need to get there early in the morning. They sell out of the popular items like the pecan rolls and chocolate croissants pretty quick so I've never actually had the pleasure of being able to try their most popular items."}, {"review_id": "OB7W111VX_s0PnjEkw23_g", "user_id": "R7Gmv06cwhLLKpaBcPfgrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/21/2017", "text": "If someone has written a bad review for this place, take it with a grain of salt.

This place has been on my list and finally I checked it out.PARKING/WAIT/SEATING:We met around 10 in the morning and it was busy! There is street parking. Saturday's are pretty busy with the farmers market happening up the street at the square. However, this day I was able to find parking close by. Also, it is free to park on the weekends!There is seating inside and outside. Since it was a cold morning there were only a few people on the patio and everyone else inside... so it was very, very crowded in there! I luckily found a seat a few minutes after walking in, but I had to practically dive to it haha. You get in line to order, then they call your name and you go get it.CUSTOMER SERVICE:Customer service was good.FOOD:I just had some hot chocolate and a cream puff. First of all, the cream puff was ginormous and very yummy. Way to rich to eat in one sitting haha. I definitely want to come back!"}, {"review_id": "d0E01DV3Pwk3WMgNOL2iQg", "user_id": "LIvR3XdUX-7VFwICd7dYRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/20/2015", "text": "o.m.creampuff. This place is such a gem bursting with charm. Inside there is seating but outside is where it looks the magic happens with a wooded area to the side and a front patio. When it's busier, be prepared for lots of 'excuse me's!' as you'll be shuffling around in line while making room for people refill their coffees and coming/going. NBD, this place has a great vibe and everyone was in full of grace. I don't think I've ever had an in-house made cream puff before LBC... it won't be my last (good thing I live 2 hours away!) It's balanced with the perfect cream to chocolate to pastry ratio - nothing is too overbearing. It. is. enormous!

First of all it's the ONLY place in the area that I've found with good bagels. Their everything bagels are done right and not mass produced like most of the area restaurants. So far I've tried the everything bagel and it was delicious. They also have good coffee with free soy milk!The atmosphere is perfect for meeting with friends or even hanging out on your own. Although the indoor eating area is a bit on the small side - the outdoor patio well makes up for it. There is a  ton of space outside to hang out and the side patio is adorable with and almost feels like you're not downtown at all. There are plants, covered seating and even a fountain.
