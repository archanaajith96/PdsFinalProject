Had heard lots of great things about Foreign Cinema so went in with some high expectations. They frequently change their menu so sometimes the dishes can be hit or miss. We really enjoyed the baked goat cheese, tuna ceviche, and the flat iron steak.

If you can, sit outside, they have heating lamps and play movies in the background on the white wall.We ordered the ceviche and goat cheese as starters. The ceviche was tasty, but what really made it was the taro chip. The goat cheese dip was amazing, I'd definitely recommend.I had the fried chicken which was a mix of sweet with a hint of curry. It came with hummus which was a nice touch to the chicken. I'd definitely come back again for this dish! This place has a ton of bloggers though which was a bit distracting while you're trying to eat as they were snapping photos of everything and everyone...  BUT other than that this place awesome.

The bartender made sure I tasted the Bulleit Bourbon in Kentucky Mules cause I was feeling GOOOD after my second of four. The chefs working in the kitchen get a round of applause because they killed it in the kitchen! Everything we ordered was the BOMB diggity (yeah I wrote that).

We've been wanting to dine here for so long but always failed to reserve a table. This time we made a reservation online 2 weeks in advance for 7:15pm on a Saturday. The ambience of this place is super cute and romantic. We sat in the outdoor patio area, where the movie is projected.  There are stringed lights draping above you and lots of space heaters to keep you warm. The movie started around 8pm, as I totally forgot about daylight savings time and it was too light outside until then. What I loved about this place is that they change their menu all the time. We order a melted cheese plate (can't remember the name) for an appetizer. For my main course I had the curry sesame fried chicken. The flavors were very unique and unlike any other fried chicken I've had before. My boyfriend ordered a Kobe steak plate, which I'd probably order if I were to go back.For dessert we ordered the coconut tres leches cake. The servers were sweet enough to put a candle and a little birthday message for me. The dessert was also yummy and they have a wide variety to choose from. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, is because where I was sitting the space heater obstructed my view to the movie and we didn't have a speaker to hear it. Though it's not a huge deal, still would been nice if I was seated elsewhere and could hear the movie. Overall, this is a great date night spot or place to celebrate an occasion. I hope to return one day and try out other great things on the menu and possibly their brunch time offerings!"}, {"review_id": "au41lQrw0Nd1Jhxm7kpMZQ", "user_id": "BbzwxRNLHKCQ1aiC-Tr4Zg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I was really excited to dine at Foreign Cinema -- so excited that I made a reservation here a month and a half in advance! We came here for an early birthday celebration, and requested to sit in the courtyard where a film is projected onto the wall every night. As a quick note, the film starts at dusk, so if this is part of the reason for dining here, make sure to make a reservation for ~7:30PM. Our reservation was at 6:30PM, and because I totally didn't account for the Daylight Savings change when I made the reservation, we were only able to see a small portion of the film that night (Eve's Bayou). We were seated immediately at our preferred patio table, which had heat lamps overhead! Both the servers and waiters were courteous for the most part, and gave some insightful menu and drink recommendations (because everything looked so good!). However, over the course of our meal and when we were ready to order, we found it difficult to get their attention, especially when refilling our water glasses when they were low. Totally understandable as each waiter had many tables to attend to, but I wish they had checked up on us a bit more.Right after ordering, we were presented with four bread slices and butter. You may have been told to not fill up on the bread, but at a restaurant like Foreign Cinema, even with an appetizer, entree, and dessert, you may still leave with your stomach not fully satiated. Therefore, don't be shy asking for more bread! It's delicious and surprisingly light.In terms of the drinks, we ordered the Macumba and the Felicity. Both were fruity and on the sweet side, with the latter being a bit stronger. These drinks came well before even the appetizer, so we actually finished these off quite quickly. Brandade (4/5) -- This is essentially a dip with thinly crisp ciabatta toast. The dip is made with salt cod and tastes like high quality fish sticks! This dish was a wonderful appetizer to warm us up and to open our palate for our entrees.Cocoa-ajwain Kobe flat iron steak (4/5) -- This dish was perfectly cooked to the desired medium rare, and the included cabernet butter balanced out the fattiness of the beef. The thinly sliced potatoes and roasted mushrooms were a welcome addition in terms of adding a variety of textures in every bite. This entree was what I had expected, and while the cocoa-ajwain was interesting, the flavor didn't really come through for me.Salted caramel ice cream profiteroles (4/5) -- We don't usually order dessert, but we saw that a neighboring table had ordered it and it looked like they enjoyed it. The dessert is two large cream puffs, which is perfect for sharing. The pastry itself was buttery, sweet, and soft, which I felt mixed well with the saltiness of the ice cream. Foreign Cinema is a worthwhile restaurant for its unique projected movie and its wonderful Californian cuisine. Located in the heart of the Mission, it almost feels like you've been transported into another city once you are inside the restaurant, away from the hustle and bustle of the streets outside."}, {"review_id": "Fdf4jFkr90AKIwhJZUfbJw", "user_id": "CvHVh4JAVWMW_R2ClWMc6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "My boyfriend made a reservation for this place a month prior, so we were seated very quickly! The first thing I noticed was that their outside seating is heated during early spring. It was so nice not feeling cold while still enjoying the open view of the sky (there is a clear tarp, so that the entire area can be available all year). We first ordered our drinks and once we ordered our appetizers and entrees, we were given bread. We didn't get the dessert menu until after our main course was over so pace yourselves! The drinks were boozy-er than other upscale places that we've visited - not that we're complaining. They were delicious and very delicate in flavor. We had ordered: Macumba - delightfully mango-y, but not overwhelmingly syrupy or sugary. Felicity - spicy! Easy to drink. The bread! Wow the bread was so good. We ended up asking if we could have more slices - and they did!For our appetizer we ordered the Brandade: for lack of better words it tasted like a delicious fish stick without all the gross artificial flavoring and deeper flavoring. I had ordered the Alaskan Halibut for the entree. It was almost perfect. The sauce paired perfectly with the halibut and the yukon gold potatoes that came with it. However I did wish that the sauce was a little move viscous. For dessert we ordered the salted caramel profiteroles. The profiteroles themselves were delicious, and the ice cream paired nicely but I felt that they were a bit too salty even with the chocolate-stout sauce which added more bitterness than sweetness to counterbalance it. All in all, we had a great time. The waiter didn't come to our table as much as we wished, but the entire experience including the movie that was projected onto the wall (thus the name foreign cinema) was worth trying!"}, {"review_id": "Ipfx7molVZem17CnijhCSg", "user_id": "7eHOl9OjI1Y_ymJQKmQK6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Heard amazing things about Foreign Cinema and it was definitely worth the hype! Make sure to make RESERVATIONS well in-advance! My date luckily snagged a dinner reservation for 9:15PM on the same night, but we arrived early 8:30PM and they were very strict with the timing. No wiggle room unfortunately. So we hopped our way to the adjoining bar lounge. Since it was gonna be a long wait anyway. The bar was super busy and cozy but we got lucky and snagged a table upstairs. Got two drinks, wine and a beer and watched a silent film while we waited :) the ambiance and decor was very chic and cinematic of course!When our time came, we again got lucky and was seated in the main outdoor/cinematic open space. Heaters were everywhere so we weren't really cold. The Walt Disney movie, Saving Mr. Banks?, was playing on the big projector against their wall. Service was amazing and I wish I remembered our sassy, charming server's name. He did a wonderful job recommending the tartare and fried chicken.Food-wise, I was overwhelming impressed by the quality. The only thing I wished was for MORE foods! Cause it was so delicious.

It was delicious. My friend and I sat outside in the patio area, luckily there was a heat lamp since it was a little chilly outside but the area is super cute I would definitely sit out there again. I love the decor! Also, definitely make a reservation for brunch or else you will not get in; it is worth the effort. I started out with a cocktail, the high fidelity. It was super refreshing and a lovely shade of pink thanks to the hibiscus that is in it. After much debate I decided to get the burger, I know it sounds boring but it was delicious! Also, pro tip add the brown sugar bacon!! You will not regret it and it will leave you wanting more! During the meal I ordered a greyhound and of course it is fresh squeezed grapefruit juice; which was my entire reasoning for ordering it in the first place. The service was really good throughout the entire service. My friend and I had a great time and like I said I can't wait to go again.

It would have been easy to be annoyed but our waitress handled it with aplomb.  We walked in on our reservation an hour early (yep you read that right!) and they were able to accommodate 9 easily.  Once seated, our poor bodies weren't used to the rainy weather of the evening so they made a lot of effort to bring the heaters to us in the covered outdoors.  It didn't quite work out but the effort was greatly appreciated in making us feel comfortable.I started with one of the whiskey flights.  My server didn't initially tell me what was what and made an effort after ten minutes to stop and ask if I needed assistance.  Great way to make it up!  The whiskey was absolutely wonderful and a great way to try what they had.  To start, we got the shrimp cocktail, baked fromage and smoked salmon.  All fantastic.  The shrimp were especially massive!For dinner, I had the flat iron and they easily accommodated the fact that I didn't want potatoes and added more rabe.  So delicious.  For dessert I had the creme caramel.  It wasn't great...a bit like an average flan and the crispy boba didn't add what I wanted.  I did try my colleague's banana creme pie and it was so good.  Kinda like fudge with banana in the middle.  Oh and did I mention they show old movies on the screen?  I was catching up with my colleagues so I didn't get to watch but nice touch."}, {"review_id": "ukgTtGvmkBzZeJ5hgfpwTQ", "user_id": "HWBTOG4T5nloTNvP-ZE_bA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "I was here with a group this past weekend. The food itself is fresh, but there was something a bit off about the burger and fries. The fries were really fresh, very similar to In-N-Out's fries. However, the burger itself was not so hot for the price that I paid for it.  The onions were kind of rubbery and had a weird texture. The burger was plain and did not have much flavor to it. I was also disappointed that there were very few sides to come with it since there were no pickles or tomatoes. The bun was also much smaller than the patty. To top it all off, the ketchup did not taste like ketchup, but like a whole different sort of sauce. We came as a party of 8 to celebrate a birthday, and the service otherwise was terrific. The staff member was nice albeit a bit slow with the process and was able to serve a cake that was purchased from another venue with candles initially, and then bring back a sliced piece of cake for each person at the table. There was no plating fee for the cake. If I were to come back, I would definitely not recommend the burger and fries, but the other options seemed fresh and healthy - just pretty expensive."}, {"review_id": "PM22srV0z60HxSNJh4xZQA", "user_id": "NAH8YYMRDszNoZq0IagTlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Been here a few times for mellow weekend brunches, but this place is definitely magical at night. The venue is immaculate, from the entryway that makes you feel as if you're walking \"the red carpet\" to the beautiful dining space inside with open kitchen, all the way to the patio dining area where there are lights strung overhead and a featured film projecting onto the wall up above. Check the website to see the current month's feature, as of now, it's Baz's \"The Great Gatsby.\" The ambiance of the venue is absolutely stunning, and all staff are super friendly, engaging, and willing to explain all the menu offerings if necessary.  Food prices are reasonably fair, for example, you can get a plate of large sea scallops for about $30. Fresh and locally sourced oysters sold by the piece, a half dozen, or dozen. Drink prices are pretty typical, and it might be worth opting for a carafe of wine for the table since you get quite a large pour. Everything tastes phenomenal from the bread to oysters to salads to mains. Scallops were probably the largest, sweetest, and the best quality I've had so far in SF. Cooked to my liking, they were served with a helping of veggies and beautifully plated."}, {"review_id": "2HB-fZmKNTgAWF9WadS25g", "user_id": "GhnqHTT1vKkLc0Z1rGsQ1A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "I have an unfettering love for Foreign Cinema - it was one of the first real restaurants I treated myself to as an adult; I've brunched here. I've dinnered here. I've recommended it to countless people.The space itself is very cool - indoor/outdoor dining space carved out of an old movie theater - they play movies on a projector against a wall during dinner time.The last time I brunched here, I thought it was very okay. I shared the following: -Pacific tuna ceviche ($16): cara cara orange, avocado, citrus dressing, red onion, habanero + taro chips-warm brandade, blended salted cod, potatoes, chili served with sliced baguette ($15) The ceviche was fresh and tangy. Paired with the orange + avocado, each bite had a nice zesty, creamy texture. I liked it a lot. The salted cod was a nice deviation from what my sister and I would ordinarily order. It was baked salty mixture of cod + potato that you slather on pieces of toast.I ordered the Dungeness crab frittata ($20) as my entrée. It comes with fromage blanc, Yukon potatoes, harissa vinaigrette, jalapeno + topped with an herb salad. Despite having the harissa vinaigrette as a dressing, my frittata was very bland and a little unimaginative. Good, but not break, and certainly not worth recommending to others.Times are a changing with the San Francisco food scene.

I was so ready to watch a flick while enjoying a luxurious meal, hell, I was ready to take some goddamn notes for my next youtube video.. ya feel me. But none of that happened because the movie was turned down to the lowest volume, almost mute with no subtitles to make up for it so I felt like I was being trolled. Sheesh. It isn't what I made it out to be in my childish imagination but one could wish. Oh yeah, the food was good btw. I highly recommend their take on calimari and the roast pork! And their service is excellent beyond words, instead of trying to watch the movie, I just observed their technique when serving customers... Total art-form, not joking.
