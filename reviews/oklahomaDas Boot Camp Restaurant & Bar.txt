Affordable food and drinks, good beer (I loved the Munich Dunkel), $2.99 for all the shots, happy hour has amazing $4 boots! We love it! The food is good, my husband votes for the Reuben, but I love the Black Forest ham sandwich served between two soft pretzels. Cheese curds are great as are sausages. Lots of TVs for watching sports and a good time. Seriously best happy hour and best prices on shots. All food less than $10."}, {"review_id": "gj1LCjb0CFpWgP4RD9FPRQ", "user_id": "tgcWrgv691jA6gJx3uoftw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "This is one of my favorites, but I gave it 4 stars instead of the usual 5 because it seems the service has downgraded just a little bit. I'm hoping this is just a temporary glitch in their past flawless rating. The last time I was here they burned my sausage, and this time I had the wrong order altogether. Again, I'm hoping this is just a coincidence and not a forthcoming trend. Otherwise, the food is great! My favorite is the cheese bratwurst and German potato salad. If you like food that is seasoned with vinegar, you have to try the German potato salad!! If not, their fries are very good as well!"}, {"review_id": "udAtX7xQzD60I1JxcNj4RQ", "user_id": "fQH1D1lrhRYgTB6Ce-0_uA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/30/2017", "text": "Tried for the first time last week and it didn't disappoint.

They have delicious, locally brewed beer. The dunkelweizen is my favorite, but I think I've had all but 1 and they have all been pretty good. Also, if you go during their happy hour, you can get a \"boot\" (32oz.) for $4, which is a steal.The food is tasty and flavorful. My go-to is the sausage sandwich with buffalo or white polish sausage. Their burgers are also good. Side items like desserts, pretzels, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, etc. are good as well. Prices are fair in my opinion.The restaurant itself is nice and open and the staff are friendly.This is a great place to get a boot and watch an afternoon OU game - especially since just about all of our kickoffs have overlapped their happy hours!"}, {"review_id": "VX8uhoZ5DhhcGWQL-L5o7A", "user_id": "jkLLrfTlvxvbZtvBbkgG-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/25/2017", "text": "Found this gem of a place while at a family reunion in Norman. I've eaten at German restaurants all over the country and this place was the best of them all. Not only is the the food fabulous, the beer selection and serving sizes from a pint up to a 3 liter boot. The service is great. We were with family that had never eaten German food and the manager was very attentive and although busy took the time to explain the apps and entree to them. By far the best Jeagersnitizel I have ever had, the mushroom and bacon gravy was amazing. But most of all it was the most affordable German restaurant I have eaten at with all entrees and sandwiches are priced under $10.

Casual German eats....schnitzel sandwich, jagerschnitzel, spatzle, cheese noodles, cabbage, potato salad...it's all delicious! I come back to eat all the time.DRINKS: The only thing I strongly dislike about Das Boot are the well drinks. They market them as $3 wells, like several other Norman establishments, but they are almost undrinkable. The alcohol is just too harsh. Now, everyone I know says their brewed German beers are great, and the boot deals are awesome (after 9pm, I think they're like $4?). So I'm only commenting on the wells.Moral of the story: Come for the food and a boot of beer, and you'll have a great time!"}, {"review_id": "eQxwanrmgSwGtvWzyI9Hrw", "user_id": "uAufFBj8hbkdHKuUjMY34g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2017", "text": "Wonderful German food joint with a fresh vibe located in downtown Norman. Did not try any of their beer, but most are served in boot steins that match the light bulb covers (also boots). Was with my sister and Mom so we were able to try many items. I went with the Buffalo Sausage. A lot of taste and came on a Pretzel roll with a bed of sauerkraut. It had an indicator next to it on the menu that it was \"2 Pepper\" out of 3, and supposed to be spicy. I didn't taste much spice. Also tried the tomato salad (highly recommended and very fresh) as well as the Jaëgerschnitzel. Great taste and a very filling me. The red cabbage was super delicious too.Has outdoor seating and very conveniently located.

We entered this Restaurant to eat some German food.  The place was packed because of the festival.  But they were very efficient in getting us a table. We were told a fifteen minute wait but was seated in 10. The restaurant itself is a lot larger than you would think.  I holds lots of people and it had big community table, individual tables and a popular bar area. The lighting is very unique. The lights are glass boots. TV,s are a big plus.  We had a sausage sampler and was so good. They give you a sample of three of their most popular sausages along with a nice mustard sauce.  The spicy sausage is very spicy. You should have some beer ready.  The German sliders on a pretzel bun were great. My wife loved the potato salad but I thought is was lacking in flavor.  My cheesy noodles were very good. However the fried onions had no crunch to them.  Now that I've been here I will order differently and get the Jagersnitchel on top of the cheeses noodles. Or some variation of that. I was not able to order my beer in a boot because of the Festival which gives me reason to return. That will be a fun experience.  I saw many other items that I want to try. I look forward to returning to Norman Main street and having another meal here."}, {"review_id": "Zw9fPsc07OBTVgrHZ7J4TA", "user_id": "eS1mGdfYXgbvPvanUPs0UA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Took some clients here to talk about the deal.

Anyway, this morning I woke up and despite the greatness of last nights meal, it feels like there's a jungle cat tearing his way out of my rectum. fans love to see it. have been informed i WAS in fact thrown out of the establishment after hurling an incredible amount of profanities at that hispanic family in the restaurant."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/das-boot-camp-restaurant-and-bar-norman?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
