It's very affordable ( about $8-$10 per plate) and very cozy. We had the Pot of Gold and it was filling and flavorful. The thing that I enjoyed even more than the food was the family that operates this place. Mom checks people in, Penny Ann is a waitress and the cooks are family as well.  Such nice people with an incredible story if you ask.  We live 45 minutes away and will definitely be back.

But the Utah tendency to exaggerate and aggrandize is on full display in reviews for this place. I just don't get it.The pancakes are NOT fluffy. And they certainly aren't the best in SLC (or anywhere for that matter). These are dense and heavy, and they are served with fake maple corn syrup.The gravy for the chop steak was super salty. The flavor was not pleasant. Barely edible.The potatoes on the side were equally unpleasant. Overcooked and without any flavor.The location is eclectic, and that's fine. In fact, it's kind of fun.

Sunday brunch after check in was 2 hours once our food arrived.Any hangovers in the bunch were given 5 cups of coffee before a speck of food. Hahaha this was post St Patrick's. Needless to say this was the most stressful experience even with my closest friends.Once the food arrived (omlet with bacon added), any special orders were forgotten, the omlet was bland and sweaty (you know what I mean), and the$15 per person after 2 hours and separating any last minute friends to another table...Never worth it.I thought the long wait time indicated amazing tasty food.

Perfect American brunch items and the food tasted oh so good.There was a steady flow of customers (we had to wait about 10 min for a party if 6, COMPLETELY worth it though). The dinner has a 50s feel to it which makes eating the American brunch dishes even better. The waiters are very attentive, refill your coffee frequently and the food came out quickly and hot!Heavenly hot cakes. Enough said. I could have had multiple stacks. If you check in on yelp you get a FREE fried scone. It was incredible. And if you sign up for their newsletter you get a FREE piece of pie. I got the chocolate peanut butter. You could say i was in a sugar coma for a bit.

I'd rate the rest of the food and experience at 4 stars.  If you give value a high weight when you're looking for a breakfast joint, however, this place would rank near the top."}, {"review_id": "EkJrQBfhti_bQn_pt0iJ9g", "user_id": "1nQgh9EsgAF-KpJ-hxIkfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "We came around noon on New Year's Day.

Even after we arrived, we still had to wait 20 minutes. Service is a little slow but the staff is really nice. I got the Arizona omelette with pancakes and the free scone that comes with the yelp check in.The scone was probably the best part. It's like a funnel cake. And the honey butter that it comes with is delicious. The omelette was good, nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about either. The potatoes that it comes with are awesome they are like chips! And the pancakes are super fluffy. I think next time I'd order the breakfast burrito because it looked amazing. Was I impressed? Nah.

It's like classic diner food but  two steps up in quality. This review is to specifically compliment the takeout service here- I ordered a TON of food and everything was packaged SO excellently. For example, pancakes came separate from the fresh fruit, which came separate from the whip cream. When a restaurant really takes that much time and care to package their food for takeout so that it travels well, it says a lot. I love a restaurant that pays attention to detail, and that is why I will always be loyal to them for my pancake and breakfast burrito needs :)"}, {"review_id": "EHwZ9pd0IxTZNpqC9NH57Q", "user_id": "f0-k8NFA_N4tY-v8ONsmYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Friendly, fast, good food, real small cafe vibe.

My husband had to get up and ask for water 15 minutes after we ordered. Then they only brought three. The server had two free hands and just one water. So our one friend--who happens to be black--wasn't given a water. At first, we made jokes about how they weren't giving him water. Then they brought everyone else's food except his. He finally asked for the water. I don't want to call racist on this, but it seemed strange. The food was mediocre, but not bad. The guys who took our name and worked the wait list were nice enough. I'm shocked a place like this had a wait. Everyone was a family or in sweatpants. Definitely not much of a brunch scene.We never saw our server until she was dropping the checks (we had intended to order something to go but at that point just wanted out anyway). She never checked on us, refilled anything, or even brought syrup for pancakes. Then she finally drops the checks. We're trying to sign and fill in her tip, and now she wants to clear the entire table. She obviously wanted us out. Again, decide for yourself about the possibility of racism. I put myself through college as a server. I have never not tipped in my life. This was a first for me, but there was no way I could give this woman \"a tip for service\" when we received nothing of the sort."}, {"review_id": "RHAq7y3HeqAC97QZnLPd_g", "user_id": "nr9o0I056x__LnbBwfjcLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "The food was good.
