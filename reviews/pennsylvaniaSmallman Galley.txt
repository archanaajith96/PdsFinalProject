For a consumer this concept is great because you get to try what new ideas the new chefs are coming up with and if you have picky friends, they'll find something in the many options available.I decided to try Colonia, because I have a weakness for Latin cuisine, and I love the idea of a restaurant exploring the less mainstream options for Latin food. I loved the pupusas and pao de queijo.My friends selected Brunoise and Iron Born for their lunches and we were very happy with the food.The drinks were equally tasty, all in all a very successful outing.Our only issue was with service, some of the people that work there seem to be unfriendly and a bit overwhelmed. Perhaps this should be part of their training, customer service."}, {"review_id": "UNYM0rrRc7LzmZC6Uie4Qw", "user_id": "mIye8goJosaeKCyMI1UK1w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I've been looking forward to trying this place every since we moved to Pittsburgh a year ago. We finally carved out a Friday night and three of us went to Smallman Galley for dinner before a night out.It was packed. I guess our mistake was coming on a Friday night. I get that it's a cafeteria-style place, but when you're looking for seating for two hours it really kills your experience. This place is way too small for how popular it is. It doesn't help that they serve alcohol so people just camp out all night.The pizza place was sold out and the other places were sold out of a lot of options as well. Some of them didn't even have time to mark what was sold out so I waited in line for 20 minutes to get a tea at one point and then was told they didn't have any.We never did find seating. I waited in a random line that us customers had kind of established and when I was at the front of the line, oblivious people kept just taking seats. Not against the rules, though, since the line wasn't official or anything. It was just chaos. We ate our food standing up in a random corner. I don't remember if it was good because I was just so angry about standing and hot from the crowded room.This being said, I would like to try it again on a slower night. I'll post an update if I ever make it back."}, {"review_id": "w-32fNkpxO9kelwFubVCaw", "user_id": "z2YVGKKcup6mjQmDQ6arEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I love this place! Great food and drinks. It's 5 resurants and a bar. The bar is where I start. If you want a finely made handcrafted cocktail this is the place for you. I suggest the Boston Sour as it is my favorite drink to have here.Iron born pizza should be on a best of Pittsburgh list. Deep dish pizza crunchy, chewy delicious crust. Innovative toppings and sauce options. The mushroom pie is my favorite. The main problem with Iron born is that it's soooo good it's hard to pick an offering from the other options.The next restaurant is Colonia, with a menu of dishes from Latin America. I have had the Pupusas, stuffed corn tortillas topped with slaw. It was better than the Pupusas I've had in other restaurants. I hope to try their other options soon.Banhmilicious is a Vietnamese restaurant that has a beautiful bone broth. I could drink it by the glass. They have pho and banh mi also.Brunoise is a French option I have not tried but the risotto looked really good."}, {"review_id": "T9NXAHjdw8El6xBY_HdGpw", "user_id": "eG1Tur78lGPRLPysNSzadQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "mm mm mmmmm. Excuse me as I scarf down this entire box of pizza, as there will be absolutely no sharing. Hand Forged, and all mine. I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to the City of Detroit in its entirety, as I previously dismissed your pizza as a gimmick, or even n imitation Chicago deep dish. I know...fighting words. But Detroit style pizza, really?! Apparently yes really! By way of Pittsburgh. Smallman Galley has been on my radar for quite some time now. The four restaurant open concept is pretty cool if I must say. Out of the four, Hand Forged easily topped my wish list; I mean it's not often you run into this style of pizza. The two sauce pie is perfect for undecideds like myself: half white, half red. And feeling extra fancy, I opt to add pepperoni to the red side. After one bite, I float into pizza heaven. Red sauce, oven crispified pepperoni, creamy white sauce, mounds of cheese, and fennel sausage(you can put that stuff on anything and id eat it). This is nothing like a Chicago deep dish! The chewy crust makes all the difference. And with the oven browning the edges, you get both chewy and crispy crust in one bite. Like I previously stated...pizza heaven. Pittsburgh is legit one of the most underrated culinarily destinations in the country in my humble opinion. Never disappoints. Add Hand Forged Pizza to the list of greats. As for the other three restaurants at Smallman, as long as this pizza is within arms length, I might never get around to its neighbors...like ever. By the way, for anyone wondering which is better, red or white? Well that's easy. The winner is....me. For having consumed both."}, {"review_id": "6MPqLkRFCI-fdG6GxA4ugw", "user_id": "Fd3GvZTer-2_EwMzL3ptAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I have wanted to come check this place out ever since I saw some photos in my feed from an event organized here by the Pittsburg Yelp CM and so was super psyched when local Yelper Phil G suggested coming here for dinner.It was easy to find parking just a block away and yay, no payment needed after 6pm. Walking into the Smallman Galley, I knew I was in for a treat straightaway - it just had a buzz and a vibe I could feel in the air! And I loved the curated restaurants! In one evening I had food from x3 continents! Vietnamese Ice Tea (Asia), Papusa (South America) and Chestnut Soup (Europe)! How cool was it to be able to travel the world, food-wise, without leaving Pittsburgh!So my thoughts on food & menu as below:Colonia - cuisines of Latin America1) I ordered a Pork Pupusa ($6.00) and this was topped with a really lovely tarty fermented slaw with jalapenos pieces that would occasionally pop up and dance in my mouth and cause me to drink up my glass of water in a gulp. I loved the fresh taste of the corn tortilla but one thing - this is a massive plate of food, so would recommend getting it as an entree to share.2) Yelper Phil G ordered the dessert plate of Churros with chocolate dipping sauce ($6.00). This came pipping hot and and I was super happy that the sugar and cinnamon taste was restrained. For me the highlight however was that dipping chocolate! Reader, I licked that bowl clean - yes, both my dining companions teased me, but I dont care. That Mexican chocolate was so lovely and whatever spices were added, it was thoroughly addictive. Absolutely Recommend!Banhmilicious1) I got my drink from here - a glass of Thai Tea for $4.00. I feel these guys are a wee bit cheap. I requested the Thai Tea to be without ice and rather than getting a full glass, I got a 3/4 glass full. I was really taken aback when handed the drink and didn't query the lack of getting a full drink, but wish I had. The taste was superb, but honestly not sure about coming back here, cause I felt like I was gypped from them!! brunoise1) I had the most incredible parsnip & chestnut soup with orange slices from here for $8.00, and frankly it was the highlight of my meal. I so want to go back and try everything from the menu here. They were making fresh chirozo when I ordered the soup and that smell was divine! The texture of the soup was so silky smooth and each spoonful was hearty and falvourful! The burnt orange added an incredible taste!! If you like French Cooking, then go here cause you are in the hands of a master!2) My other colleague ordered the dessert from here - a lovely Lemon Meringue Tart for $8.00. I loved the taste of the mint that was used and the concord grape sorbet was just massively refreshing and to my palate, didnt taste grape-y at all. In fact I thought I was eating something made of apples and prunes and we went back to the restaurant counter to confirm what the Sorbet was made of.Overall Verdict?? GO GO GO!PS - I thought of knocking a star down b/c of the service received from Banhmilicious but brunoise & Colonia's food made me so happy, it overcame that lack!Yelp 67/2018"}, {"review_id": "gJTY8v6OLHoYDO2l77X1mw", "user_id": "oAkiKNAfRSbVKJ--oCB_iw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I love it here so so much!

It was truly one of the most delish sandwiches I have ever had. It was made with Brazilian cheese bread, which is basically a carb from heaven itself. It cradled a dippy egg and some roasted turkey.

So, I went for the popular choice and I am glad I did that.It is very delicious and I am not sure what they topped it off with. But it seemed to be a mix of cheese and mashed potatoes. I loved the pie and it is neither too heavy nor too light. Just the right amount for two people. My friends ordered curry and noodle soup from the Vietnamese restaurant.

You find a seat, leave the number on your table, and the wait staff brings your food to your seat. We ordered from all four of the stands and everything came out about the same time!

As someone who is very indecisive, this plays right into my alley. Furthermore, the idea that this space is helping chefs develop their menus is very heart warming! It's nice to know that these small businesses don't have to worry about their location costs when making the best food they can! Although it's a lot of different flavors, the ability to try a bunch of things and share among a few friends or family is priceless. It's my favorite quality about this place: diversity in the menu. Also, we took recommendations only from the waitress and I can safely say she has good taste!We got tacos from the Vietnamese place, iron born pizza, and a burger as well. The tacos were so good we got seconds and tasted very fresh. The tortilla complimented the sauces and meat nicely, which was surprising to me. The pizza was thick and the dough was airy and sweet. It was almost as if you could taste the amount of time and effort put into making that dough. The burger was delicious. It was juicy and flavorful and just made me want to eat more.I would highly suggest coming here with a large group of people so that you have the chance to share and experience more!

For example, I ordered a Detroit Style pizza from Iron Born, and although it was alright, it was just that. A lot of bread, and some touches of finesse on the top.More disappointing was Colonia, which gave a nice presentation and ambitions for a fancy dish, but made a mediocre food. For the flank steak, the meat was essentially rubber and the rest of the veggies were very strongly flavored. For the chicken bowl, there were these donut shaped starch things, and a ton of extraneous veggies. I'm not even sure if there was chicken, but the dish was so salty I didn't bother finding out. Overall, my impression of Colonia was that the chefs were trying too hard...I think it's important to  keep the essential parts of the dish simple, not to over salt things, and not to crowd the plate with a jambalaya of ingredients.Overall, I had an underwhelming experience, but Smallman is still a very legit place with great options and cooling culture."}, {"review_id": "09C5qDJwhHaeUxYNCKBM4A", "user_id": "WQnfyig39Xg5ni98ci-VBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "If you can snag the seats, this place is a great group spot for brunch.

Not just this brunch, but all brunches everywhere.-Bahnmilicious (Vietnamese food). This is the place I ordered my brunch dish from. I had the Jasmine rice and Chinese sausage (fried egg, cucumber, picked vegetables, and sweet sauce.) The whole thing was SO good, but the deliciously sweet sausage was hands down the star. The fresh veggies and rice in (what tasted to me like a fish sauce) were great as well.
