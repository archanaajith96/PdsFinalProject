Interior of restaurant reminded me of an old school Italian restaurant back east. Low lighting and quiet inviting ambiance. Opted to sit outside and take advantage of the sunset and warm weather. Not all that well lit but the river is so pretty to look at and LOUD!Restaurant was closing soon when I showed up. Asked the server what was the freshest filet on the menu and he recommended the steelhead. As you can see by the photo I almost licked the plate clean!  The fish was cooked perfectly as were the veggies. The sauce was nice and creamy but not heavy. Perfect serving size! Didn't leave stuffed and uncomfortable. Great experience! phenomenal dinner! Highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "7chKB0E-p8MfueI4L2PQ3g", "user_id": "9ebVaSNs9WbKACo5tXZpzA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Awful experience, awful food, and awful service. Ordered a $50 steak to have my steak knife slammed down on the table by a waitress and the steak horribly charred. No flavor, my vegetables were cold, and the mashed potatoes tasted burnt because the intensely charred steak was placed on top of them. Me and my honey are young and not typically too picky however if I am spending upwards of $100 on a meal, I expect the upmost professional service, atmosphere, and presentation. This restaurant delivered none of those things. I will never eat here again."}, {"review_id": "kK0g7JMq5HXBjHmhgMNA2Q", "user_id": "iCsGGQIAqXzM23s-22CcJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "This place is great! I've lived in Spokane for years but never got around to dining at Clinkerdagger because of the prices--until now! We celebrated a 20th birthday here and were met with great service and amazing dishes. Yes, it's a bit expensive, but it's great for a special occasion!I got the Chophouse burger and it was delicious; other attendees had the pork chop and the wild mushroom ravioli, both which received raving reviews. The appetizer salads are also delicious (and reasonably priced), as was the Brie cheese plate! Our waitress was nice, attentive, and willing to help with questions; we appreciate that! Overall, a great experience that I can highly recommend for anyone looking for a nice evening out!"}, {"review_id": "DPgxzM64wM9ItcqH3E0sew", "user_id": "9zRyLAWjy8K6wg4H9W32Aw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "Clinkerdagger's has been a Spokane staple for so long and for good reason!You can't beat the river view, the decor during the holiday season is especially beautiful, and the food is consistently good with a little bit of something for everyone!I HIGHLY recommend their prime rib and creme brulee.

The view watching the sunset over the water cannot be beat and the walk-through of this old flour mill really is pretty cool! (Think and old ship deck-like feel.) 4 Stars for the drinks! They were delicious and filled to the brim (even though my martini didn't make it to the table as full as when it was poured at the bar) but it took far too long to get to me and a decent amount was left on the tray.  2 Stars for the service and the food. Despite sitting at the bar for close to 20 minutes, it took nearly 10 minutes just to place the drink order and another 10 for the drinks to be made. As mentioned above, they were delicious once they arrived (I got the 3 Berry Cosmo) but the wait was unnecessary. Once I placed my food order, (20 minutes later) I immediately asked the waitress for a straw for my water and a dessert menu and 20 minutes after that, one of the two came back (the straw.) She actually said \"I didn't forget, it just takes me awhile!\" (aka...she forgot.) Sadly, the dessert menu never showed up and even if it had, our 3 hour dinner had made us one of the last people in the place. As for the food, my rib eye came out lukewarm, at best, and by the time it finally did arrive, the sun had set so much I could barely see to eat it. The only light source was a lamp on the patio 20 feet away and some small string lights on the railing behind us. This Rock Salt Roasted dish is supposed to be their specialty and it was tasty but I question it's $37 price tag. Would I come back here for a date? Maybe, if we had no place to be for the night. But a First Date? Hell no! What a nightmare that would be if it didn't go well!"}, {"review_id": "1iNI5nXwAtDnKL1dfMHoeQ", "user_id": "0oxs7weckFXu4YXmd0gXYg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Yuck yuck yuck. My Experience started with being unsure of where to enter the building because there is no sign for the restaurant.  The server was nice but that's the only Positive thing I have to say. I had a blueberry crush cocktail which tasted like cough syrup and gasoline. For an appetizer we had the fried calamari which was super salty. For dinner i had the peppercorn crusted New York strip and it was actually more of a chicken fried New York steak. It was extremely greasy and that's the only flavor. Yuck. I will not be back."}, {"review_id": "96lR8STdqWKzmgy86R9YoQ", "user_id": "9TSuwILGyLr3SicufUlqeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "The Clinkerdagger is great!  A colleague told me that this place is a Spokane gem, and that if I'm ever in the area, then I'll have to get the prime rib.This was a really tough pick because there were at least 7 things I wanted to try.   Due to the recommendation, I went with the prime rib, and I didn't look back.  The meat was perfectly cooked and the horseradish was amazing.  I don't know how someone could give less than 5 stars...

The building is shared by other businesses and restaurants. Clinkerdagger is in the back of the building overlooking the river. The entryway makes you feel like you're walking into an old timey speakeasy or something. There's a cool stained glass window as you come in that's very pretty. The big windows in the restaurant give a great view of the river. I sat at the bar to have my dinner. The bar area was a bit small, but the rest of the restaurant looked spacious. I know this is a steak and fish place, but I got the Wild Mushroom Ravioli and Braised Short Rib. It was great. There were plenty of ravioli on the plate, with a smallish piece of short rib. I'm not complaining about the short rib at all...it was delicious. But the ravioli and sauce are supposed to be the highlight of the dish. The sauce was rich and savory, with pieces of tomato and spinach in it. I'll be having cravings for this dish in the future."}, {"review_id": "XIVufm5z9bmklw8EaSWgCw", "user_id": "kP0Su_i8GHUIDQuAuwBeSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I absolutely loved my experience at Clinkerdagger. We had a party of 8 on a Sunday evening and our waitress was incredible. She was speedy and checked in frequently to refill our water, etc. While the food is more expensive then I'm accustomed to I would definitely recommend this restaurant for special occasions. We started with garlic bread and calamari, both of which were delicious. I tried two of the cocktails which were also amazing. One was Blueberry crush, I would definitely recommend it for anyone who likes sweet drinks. Our main dishes though were what put Clinkerdagger over the top. I had the BBQ Mahi Mahi with potatoes. It was so delicious and well made and even the leftovers tasted good. The other dish is the meatloaf Wellington which my boyfriend highly recommends! Overall I really enjoyed my experience!

The restaurant is located in downtown Spokane inside a plaza building, which reminds me of Pike Place Market in Seattle (haha). The inside interior is cozy along with the seating above the Spokane River. The slanted windows remind me of SkyCity at Space Needle in Seattle (again - haha). We wanted to stay away from the typical American meals, such as sandwich or burger, so we ordered from the Chef's Specials menu. I ordered grilled salmon with arugula, potato, and orange sauce. My boyfriend ordered grilled pork chop, seasonal veggies, and brussel sprouts topped with Bourbon sauce. Well, the overall experience was good. The waitstaff are very prompt and professional, and we didn't have to seek extra attention elsewhere. Looking at the river while eating food, it was not a bad idea for a rainy Saturday. I personally thought the food could be better, for the flavor was quite bland. The salmon dish could have gotten a bit more orange sauce, and the pork chop dish could used a bit more Bourbon sauce as well. When my boyfriend requested the Bourbon sauce, it did not have that \"smoky\" or \"reminisce\" flavor of Bourbon but still contained the alcohol traces behind.We would come back to Clinkerdagger again, but we will order something else from the menu."}, {"review_id": "xDkg1se5-EaQidnDFed6Ig", "user_id": "BMnj_MIfuX96a-CrcM6TaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Omg amazing i loved it!!

Filled with different restaurants and trinket shops. I think they even have a little chocolate shop. This is my first time at Clinks though as I wander through the hallways to get to the entranceway of Clinks. Can you pass a couple restaurants and enjoy the smells. Once we got to the entrance I'm not even kidding as I was walking in I felt like I was going to go in the haunted mansion it was super rustic mid evil type feeling! I loved every moment this is such a neat place. We had reservations and got seated within a minute there was a complication somebody was in our seats so I didn't get to sit right beside the window it was a little bit across from it but it was a booth seat  so I didn't mind because they were very comfortable. And the view from our table was an amazing best view in town for sure. I ordered their house red wine most places I find the wine taste a little bitter at the end I don't know why but this one was a sweet and smooth ... no bitter aftertaste. Good thing I didn't order the bottle we would have been in trouble there. Ha ha  For starters we got an apple walnut salad, Caesar salad and the best tasting calamari I have ever had! Usually I'm used to it to be robbery calamari this one was soft just about melted in your mouth. I would definitely recommend the calamari to anyone. Our server also brought a warm bread I kind of like chunks of garlic on there. We got a couple refills. For our entrée I got the 16 ounce prime rib medium $45 and my table also got 10 ounce filet mignon $48and a chicken penne pesto substituted for fettuccine$20. Everything was delicious as to be expected. Holy my prime rib was huge I didn't want to share but I gave a bite to everyone a sample. Lol. For dessert we had apple cobbler which I was told was too sweet. Pumpkin cheesecake just perfect. And I had the pear bread pudding not to sweet or bland just perfect. I did order a \"death by chocolate\" $11 drink I had a couple sips it tasted to artificial for me to even drink so I would not recommend this drink the server was nice took it off our bill. Maybe for dessert next time I'll have to try the hot mocha instead   Until next time Clinks. I think I will be full for the next week."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/clinkerdagger-spokane?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
