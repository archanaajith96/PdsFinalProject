I really love coming here to get desserts and to order their birthday cakes!! I bring my siblings and friends here to get a variety of treats and split them up to try them all. My favorites: 1. MILK BREAD!! Soft bread with a creamy, almost pudding-like texture filling. I always get a couple of these each time I'm here. 2. Fruit birthday cakes - sponge cake with icing that is not too over-bearingly sweet. You can get these in slices!3. Fruit pastries - I don't know what they fill these croissant pastries with, but I'm a huge fan of it. They always put fresh fruits on them too. Overall, it may get pricey because you'll want to get everything! Definitely worth a try for anyone who like desserts that are refreshing and aren't too sweet."}, {"review_id": "JDMt67UbHH7XTD8KNYfJXA", "user_id": "8Co-CRKeeDsYeoDHWSDGKA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Okay sooo apparently KC folks don't know their boba. Being from SoCal, I know boba like the back of my hand. This was hard, chewy, flavorless boba. The smoothie part taste like straight up water and cheap powder flavoring. The desserts were highly disappointing and weren't fresh. I came on a Friday night and to top it off, the cashier did not say a single word to me except the total. I said hi and she just smiled and told me how much, gave me my change and that was it. I won't be back and can't recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "ToAjjaE7hLbUrcK95TDBtg", "user_id": "Hi10sGSZNxQH3NLyWSZ1oA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "I prefer Three Les Jours and Four Les Hours to Two Les Jours, but they're all pretty good.A truly delicious Bakery with decent if slightly high prices for Kansas City - but average for Asian bakeries. It's just that there aren't many of them around here, so it's pretty cool to come upon this one, so to speak.It's way down in Overland Park which has more ethnic places then you would probably imagine.

This time the whole family tagged along. Everyone loved it. We went around noon and they still had a decent selection of items. I've updated my review with new photos. This place is magical! My daughter and I stopped in for a treat tonight. We loved it! Their selection was a bit picked over due to the tone of day, but we still managed to score some delicious treats. We'll definitely get there earlier next time we go. We had 2 drinks, a cream filled pastry called a \"milk cream cornet\", a sugar coated donut called a \"twist twist\", and a slice of cake. The sugar coated donut was my favorite. It was crispy on the outside, but fluffy on the inside. Truly wonderful! The whole cakes in the case were gorgeous. I know where I'll be getting all of our birthday cakes from now on. :)The place was very clean! It has a very relaxing atmosphere. The interior colors are soft and the lighting is perfect. The employees were very sweet. I have no complaints at all. Can't wait to go back."}, {"review_id": "IgQzwWziqUImWdJxbX3kVg", "user_id": "eDFrmALBc-HcJi3xXIV6RQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I'll admit when we got here the cases were literally empty of the delicious goodness I was hoping to see, but we came for the macarons anyway and they were in stock!

However, when I brought this up with my coworkers, they mentioned that there was a Tous Les Jours in Overland Park, KS. A name that was familiar to me from my days back in Houston, TX. I immediately rushed over there after work, in order to satisfy my craving, as well as to bring some home to surprise my boyfriend.The Tous Les Jours here is very similar to the ones in TX. They offer a similar selections of items, and the quality is also on point. The only difference is that they serve croquettes here, which I do not believe I saw back in Houston, as well as The Roasterie Air Roasted Coffee.I really enjoy their melon bread, coffee kaya bun, custard bun, and tarts. Their cakes are really nice, fluffy, and not overly sweet, and their croquettes are crispy and hot, making it a delicious savory treat when it's cold outside.The only thing that I've tried and disliked here is their milk tea. It was really sweet, and the boba at the bottom was hard. However, they specialize in baked goods, not boba, so I can't really complain about the quality.Overall, if this place wasn't so far from where I lived, I would definitely come here more often, but when I'm in the area, I'll make sure to stop by. Plus, this is where I plan on getting all my cakes for special events because I am hooked!"}, {"review_id": "TBLcJ1d5kO6taUhPgH62RA", "user_id": "r5b2VV4jJRw-tI6ulglxOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "A Korean bakery in Kansas City?! In a city where Korean food I believe is pretty limited, I'm glad a bakery (also a huge chain in Korea) found it's way in Overland Park for fellow Koreans such as I. The one downside is the distance....anyone not living in OP it's going to be at least a 15 to 20 minute drive.  Now for the pros. The bakery has a lot of the traditional Korean baked desserts that you would expect to find in Korea, or in bigger bakery shops in cities such as Los Angeles or Chicago.  They also have regular baked white bread and custom made cakes as well.  They also have a glass section in the middle that contains all different kinds of little dessert rolls, sandwiches, and sweets.  The restaurant also serves as a cafe and serves many hot beverages such as coffee and tea, even bubble tea. After 8pm, their daily made specials are half off (the baked goods in the glass displays)! So that's definitely a steal as a well. Of you're new to Korean baked goods, I'd recommend any of the pastries that has mung bean for a sweeter taste. They also have koroke which is pretty much a fried donut with different stuffing in it like kimchi and curry (don't knock it til you try it it's super good). I come here once every 2-3 weeks to get my Korean cravings fixed !"}, {"review_id": "2y2xeH787EJ_Zumh8r9hlQ", "user_id": "Y3nzTZhiwcKcsJBEHY2QfA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "I've been to Tous Les Jours in CA, so I amso excited to revisit the bakery again. Oh how much I love a French bakery style.I picked up quite a lot of things from here. From breads, pastries, and cakes, all great quality. Milky bread filled with cream is my favorite. They just added Croffins into their menu early this summer, so check thay out. It is definitely awesome, the best one goes fo Matcha Croffins. Their birthday cakes are awesome (birthday cakes are not only for birthday!) I would come here everyday if I live in the area.

The prices here are as sweet as the confections, hovering around $2-3 each--perfect for the first-timers who can't decide what they want or returning customers who have decided they want it all.If super sweet isn't your thing try the Sweet Pumpkin Donut or the mild earthy sweetness of the Snow Pea. Of course, you could always try the more savory fare from the warming cabinet if you're looking to avoid sweets entirely.

They have Roasterie coffee, smoothies, Boba tea and hot tea available.  They will make your favorite coffee beverage as well.  There is a water station too.  The place is pretty big and you could work from there just not sure the Wi-fi situation.  They have high chairs as well.  The ambiance is very chill and relaxing.  It is quiet and just feels like you are out of the city.  The staff is so sweet.  We got five pastries and shared them all.  We had a huge cream puff with fresh strawberries, the cream was not super sweet, it was just perfect and the pastry was fluffy and soft but not at all mushy from the cream.  One pastry was like pizza topped with ham and cheese.  So incredible and could be a lunch or dinner.  The apple pastry was the winner, buttery crisp.  The almond pastry was second up.  Just like an almond croissant but crispier.  The cream cheese pastry was crispy on the outside and soft inside with just a smidgen of cream cheese.  Everything was so balanced there was not too much of anything so it was easy to eat.  I can't wait to go back and try more things."}, {"review_id": "Tw7R0QBYr671TVreJNSTnw", "user_id": "5Yq0ua6gofvUxOlDO7ni5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "We came to this cafe for macaroons and were absolutely shocked to find they had much more desserts.

Warm savory pastries or sweet cream filled beauties fill the cases. It's so neat and orderly. Right at the door the  reality of this tasty bakery is tangible. The smells of cakes,and breads baking, and coffee brewing is divine. Price, calories and ingredients are all visible which I kinda love/hate. Love the prices but visual reminder of calories holds me back from eating two days worth in one sitting. I feel like most of the case options are around $2 and than it goes up. The cold case has macaroons, tiramisu, parfaits, sliced and whole cakes. I picked up a matcha cake for a birthday party. It really suited the person but it really didn't have a strong matcha flavor, it was very subtle. People who didn't even know what matcha was or why it was green loved it. All the cream used is lightly sweet as are the pastries. Whole loafs of fresh bread are also available. They can run out of the favorites early but I always manage to score a treat.Once I've made my choices I head to the register, where every time the most kindest people  greet me and I also order a drink. Once seated by the window, on the bench I can see the space almost in it's entirety. It's small but doesn't feel like it. Behind the counter their is a big window that I can see into the baking space. As I'm eating my current option I'm thinking about my next visit. Their is one long table and small ones all light wood. The feel is clean, crisp and smells divine. The location is really the only thing about it that could be tricky. It's on the back of an outlet shopping center off of Metcalf and 103rd. So you can't see it from the road but also hiding back their is an Asian market and cafe. Also located fairly close is a beautiful park with a trail."}, {"review_id": "Um6YWRAWSeTyMYvcgexRWg", "user_id": "2FAYIIecGFsfcxUbwSRqjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "In town for a family reunion and found this place looking for a desert shop.  Best find in KC to date.  Came in grabbed a tray and loaded up on the sweets in the server yourself cabinet.  Then up to the counter for cakes and macaroons.  We got a raspberry and a lemon macaroon.  Set down try them and I instantly go back to the counter for one of every flavor.  They were that food.  Stand out favorites were salted caramel, lemon and raspberry.   For us that is all were excellent.
