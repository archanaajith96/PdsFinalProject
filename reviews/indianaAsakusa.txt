When we explained that we ordered tempura, our server removed the sushi and abruptly walked away. He didn't even offer to get us the correct appetizer!30 minutes later our entree arrived. It too was incorrect--our server was no where to be found to correct the incorrect entree. Total fail--and waste of 2 hours!"}, {"review_id": "gdzzdQLlpSN1YFerfrhJzg", "user_id": "aR8cccKx8RaI2Y50ggLJEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Great sushi and service.

This has been a long time go-to place for my friends and I whenever we are craving sushi. One of the best in Fort Wayne. They have a large menu with a variety of rolls to choose from. My favorites are the specialty rolls. Don't forget to check out their lunch specials! There's always a really good deal! If dining during dinner time, expect a little bit of wait time as this is a popular place and there is not a lot of seating. The atmosphere is clean and intimate with dim lighting and oriental style dividers between tables and dining areas. The staff is always so sweet, friendly, and knowledgeable about items on the menu. Highly recommended! Can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "SYQUJiXimV9VxbLSvW6K9w", "user_id": "teI6niIeMvJlo1-moK83tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "As I make my exit from Fort Wayne, IN, this is the restaurant that I will miss most.

The sushi is light, fresh and well rolled. The sashimi is crisp, and melts in your mouth. The teriyaki meats are tender and tasty. The rice and veggies that accompany these dishes are succulent and savory. The service is also top notch--attentive but not overly so. I always have a great time whenever I go to this restaurant.

I really wanted to love this place. It was my go-to in 2010 and 2011, when I lived here before. I loved it! Is it because since then I lived in LA, CA and experienced fish fresh from the ocean? Is it because in MI I was a mile away from one of the best places in MI? I don't know. Either I've changed or they have.We went the other night and it was OOOO KKAAAYYY. If I didn't know better, it would be good. But since I do ... the fish could've been fresher. The presentation could've been brighter. The rice could've been tighter. The service was good although our server had a bit of bedroom-voice going on. He was a good server but my husband and I did laugh about him trying to seduce us. Lol. I don't know. Since we moved back, I was looking forward to going here again.At this point I'm ready to try any of the other local places that get good reviews. That makes me sad!"}, {"review_id": "Nfz4DGRQvNYzRDieRrP_5g", "user_id": "vCYjSND9ik9HWeLzZT4pGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "Had a lovely dinner here with colleagues on a business trip.  The restaurant has a really nice ambiance and although they get busy, the staff is prompt efficient and courteous.

At first I was afraid of trying this place because I had Asakusa off of Jefferson pointe before and it wasn't that great. However, my friends convinced me to try it at this location. I'm glad I did because it is delicious! They have other foods such as tempura shrimp, salmon, etc if you're not into sushi! I'm a fan of sushi from cooked to raw! I highly recommend getting the bonsai roll! It's probably the best roll they have there. I don't remember seeing any specials that they have except for the combination (sushi with two entrees). I'm usually there for dinner so I'm not sure what their lunch menu is like. The reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the rolls are filled with a lot of rice. Also, it falls off easily once you pick up the roll :(. Very disappointed in that BUT the deliciousness makes up for it. As for pricing, it is the typical sushi price ($10-12/roll)!
