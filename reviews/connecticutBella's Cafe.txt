I have had meals at this establishment that have satisfied my soul for weeks. This visit, I didn't feel the same. Construction has not begun yet so that wasn't a factor. It took an unusually long time to be served. We sat for about 20 minutes without any beverages. No water, no coffee, nothing. When I made eye contact with our server gave me the 1 minute finger sign. She brought over coffee and tea but still no water. We ordered breakfast like eggs, bacon, home fries and a souffle pancake to share knowing it was going to take 25 minutes, but asked for the eggs to come out first. To my shagrin the waitress came over with the lemon souffle pancake, which was beautiful, but tasteless and no eggs. When we did get the eggs, the bacon was overcoooked, the potatoes lacked flavor, and the toast was dry. No butter jelly, or jam accompanied them. I was dumbfounded! I have never had an experience like this at Bella's. I'm not sure what happened but it wasn't a beautiful day."}, {"review_id": "ZNRNoehDbdbfsgIWO3W4rw", "user_id": "U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Considered by many to be one of New Haven's best spots for Breakfast and Brunch, an address nearly three miles Northwest of Yale's campus cutting down on college traffic and making it a distinctly locals-only sort of place, Bella's Café played host to a memorable meal on Saturday morning mostly on the merits of its Food but also due to the customer service.Originally opened in 2000 and still packed over seventeen  years later, the counter and tables at 896 Whalley Avenue available via walk-in only beginning at eight o'clock Tuesday through Sunday, it was no more than thirty minutes after Bella's opened for business that parties larger than one were being informed of a wait, the benefits of arriving early and traveling alone yielding a spot at the Bar where Coffee was filled quick, though the man acting as host could not seem to keep from bumping into chairs throughout the meal.Offering all-day Breakfast until 3:00pm on weekdays and 4pm on Weekends, Saturday and Sunday seeing no less than six specialty items plus an equal number of Mimosas added to an already respectable menu, it was with a tall chair shifted away from a man and woman talking politics that options were perused and an order placed, the Croque Madame Soufflé skipped due to the presence of Mustard that was never in the original recipe even though many places seem to think it should have been.Using seasonality as a guide during warmer months and serving a heartier menu during Autumn and Winter, Bella's famous \"Italian Style\" French Toast so popular that a gluten-free version was created to join Griddles, Eggs, Omelets, Salads and Sandwiches, it was after considering the local favorite that the decision was instead made to invest in two specials, the flip-side to quick seating being that a solo diner can only eat so much.Waiting perhaps thirty minutes for the bustling kitchen to produce an order, the barman and his female co-worker checking in frequently and keeping Coffee topped off, it was now with a fair number of folks standing in the foyer that two large plates were set down carefully with sides of warm Maple Syrup from Vermont, the Buttercream slowly slipping off a stack of three fluffy Pancakes made with Flour and lots of shredded Carrots plus Buttermilk, Pineapple, Coconut and finely chopped Walnuts.Quickly understanding what Westville residents have been raving about, the Syrup almost unnecessary as the Pancakes themselves were nicely balanced and plenty sweetened by Fruit and Frosting, it was moving on to Bella's Sticky Bun French Toast that taste buds once again were delighted, the lack of Syrup provided for this plate completely justifiable as each buttery housemade Biscuit was soaked with creamy Custard and layered by a sugary Cinnamon Smear."}, {"review_id": "kFDWQGvk1uUs2qFEL2siDA", "user_id": "DuNi6Rgk8eZjFahCyFxp6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Delicious food with a southern comfort feel!

The wait for a party of two was 45 minutes to an hour. This time I brought my partner to try them. I had a special Banana Foster French Toast and a special sausage Apple and Chicken. He had the Tuscan Omlet and a short stack of pancakes. Visiting again, I am realizing their service IS a bit slow. Not to a terrible point, but plan to hang out and chat before food arrives. If you need a quick meal, this might not be a good stop.As for the dishes this time, my favorite bite was the sausage. It had good flavor and texture-wise was moist with a good amount of 'chew' to it. The french toast special was good but rubbed me wrong with a strong rum flavor. My partner tried it and said it was mostly my preferences against alcohol-y flavor, but that it was on the heavier handed side. As for the omelet, \"the asiago was sharper than expected. A little too much for my undistinquished palatte. But well made and portioned,\" according to partner. I thought it had a rich depth of rustic veggie flavors and the asiago went well. The side potatoes and biscuit were both classic, basic, and delicious. The pancakes \"were good 10/10. They were a bit larger than expected though, for a short stack (two plate sized pancakes for the $5.00 shortie). Soft and fluffy texture with a lot of flavor.\"Overall, glad I came back and hope to come again!"}, {"review_id": "qFoXSTt6gfmWtD65ULcvKQ", "user_id": "fxJJCJnw_SkrH3u7k3aAYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "So good... very delicious Shrimp and sausage grits.

My mom and who family friends had an amazing meal here! The restaurant has a wonderful homey feel and kind staff. Mom loved her cheesesteak. It looked so good and was a great portion. And if you enjoy sweet potato fries, the ones here are super crispy and so good!I loved my strata!! It had artichokes and sundries tomatoes and spinach and it was huge!! I couldn't eat it all of my life depended on it. I definitely recommend this if you're not sure what to enjoy. The ladies had chicken salad on cranberry walnut bread and both loved it. They said to try it for sure. And the table of us enjoyed the chocolate French toast. It's perfect for sharing!! So yummy. Bring from Long Island this is a long way for me, but 1000% worth it!!

The gentleman today was so nice. Your food is always amazing...yet a year or two ago I would've given you a 0 based on the way you treat people when they come to eat. For example when my husband was parking the car with our two young children I was asked to get up after I was seated and wait for him as the wait staff sat others! Then once he came they told me I had a 20 min wait.....hold on there peeps I was already seated and then you asked me to get up.....now I gotta wait.....smells like you don't want me in your restaurant!!! Wow they couldn't wait not even 2 min! needless to say they didn't care how people felt when they were asked to get up from a table.

Their special changes monthly !! Everything was so good. I admit the wait is a bit long, from getting a table to waiting for the food. It's took over 30 mins for our food but that's how busy they are ! And how good their food is!! The vanilla chai tea was very good and not overly spiced. The crab dumplings were stuffed with crab and had this amazing sweet sauce. The chorizo hash was delicious. The chorizo itself had a kick but not over powering. The proportions are huge ! Everything was so good and totally worth the wait.  Last time we went they ran out of their brunch specials. Shrimp and grits is an delicious alternate that's always on their menu"}, {"review_id": "AiyvzNuj4_Ms84_ubx66xw", "user_id": "U85MLgBTeIf6QHaaRsOPpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "Highly recommend!

The only downside is that it was quite pricey for what it was.

My friends ordered the buoy omelette which we all enjoyed immensely initially, but after awhile, we started getting sick of it.
