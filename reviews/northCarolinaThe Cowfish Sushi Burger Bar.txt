When I arrived at cowfish I was surprised, originally the restaurant that held my heart for best burger was hops ( bar and burger joint in Greensboro). But cowfish won that with the black truffle burger. I couldn't be more happier with my experienceAlso shout out to Natalie for providing the best and I do mean the best customer service I've ever received in my life !!!!!!!!!!"}, {"review_id": "-UuLlGqunAELyD-18ByvYg", "user_id": "ecI8jn7R7H2jL7na6NexFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "To be honest I have never had Cowfish's Sushi only their burgers and I always tend to go in May close to my birthday lol! When I arrived the first thing you notice is the parking. There are plenty of places to park. They have a deck on every side of the restaurant and a open parking lot on the back of the shopping center. Because they don't take reservation the wait is ALWAYS sooo long. But this time I didn't have my child with me so I sat at the bar. My friend, Kenya likes Cowfish a lot because they offer a variety of sushi. We ended up ordering the mango sushi, bagel roll and he crab Rangoon dip and it was sooo good. Our servers were cool. They kept our water filled up and our food came out sooo quick. The atmosphere is that of a bar loud, fast pace and live. I like Cowfish because of its variety."}, {"review_id": "YaWuvDeZUmr91hIcKNxhLg", "user_id": "x_Frpa8QWc25FDJ5BJM8tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I've been meaning to try Cowfish for months now - glad I finally got to do it! Their entire menu is MASSIVE, so take a look at it before coming. Service was a bit slow but the food is worth it!There are three different styles of burgushis you can get (in a bento box, burgers in sushi roll form, or sushi in burger form). I went with the 4-S (Sear-iously Sensational Sushi Sandwich is its full name haha). It was seared Koji marinated tuna and yellowtail, topped with Asian slaw, red peppers, daikon sprouts, cucumber. It was served on grilled spring roll wrapper \"buns\" that were filled with kani (imitation crab) and sushi rice. It came with a side of sambal sesame soy and a choice of side - I chose seaweed salad. The burgushi was so enormous I couldn't pick it up! I loved the entire meal and especially loved the concept of the sushi rice-filled wrapper \"buns\".My friend got a Fusion Specialty roll instead of a burgushi. She really enjoyed the Firecracker Roll. It was shrimp tempura, kani, tempura flakes, yellowtail, salmon, spicy mayo, masago, tobiko and scallions, served with ponzu dipping sauce."}, {"review_id": "22yGhBQu2XC8C4Wk4kUslg", "user_id": "F1OR0Fg96zFs-DERiEJUGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Dinner.

I love the food, interior design/ decor, and overall experience. You can have sushi, burgers, or a combo of both! Server: was nice and quick. She was helpful when asked about the dishes.Food: was fresh and delicious. The plates and food was decorated in a really cool and nice way. It was appetizing. My partner ordered one of Burgushi Boxes, which was tasty but the burger was very small. I ordered the motherload which was amazing. Fresh and yummy.Environment: They have an aquarium, which is pretty cool. The decorations all around makes it nice and an amazing experience. If you tell them you have a birthday, the servers would come to your table and make little noise with drummers and what not. Pretty cool. It seems like its always busy so make sure you don't go there and expect an immediate seating. They don't take any reservations.I would totally recommend this place for a nice dinner date, group or family gathering."}, {"review_id": "gV-BebUnuy_KRE59Vu7hLQ", "user_id": "gtDR_RxUmJNHitQQ012SUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "OMG!!!!!!

Since this was a three hour drive from where I live, and I did not want to be disappointed.So we arrived at 1:30 on a Saturday and there was still a wait for a table. I guess that's a petty good sign if there is still a wait that late on a Saturday. We were told the wait time would be 15-30 minutes for three of us. In reality, it only took about 12 minutes. When was the last time you were quoted a wait time and it wound up being less then the shorter time?!We were sat and it took about five minutes for the waiter to get to our table; clearly, they were busy. We ordered beers and they had a Wicked Weed on tap. I'd always wanted to try one and the IPA I had was delicious. All three beers did come a little flat, I could tell they'd been sitting on the bar for a couple of minutes before they were dropped off. For apps, we started with the steamed edamame with sea salt. Since my friend sadly doesn't like spicy, we didn't get smoked salt or Sriracha salt. Good app. From there, I had the black truffle bacon cheeseburger. It was a good sized half pounder and I requested jalapeno bacon on it.  When I bit in, it really tasted like regular bacon, I didn't notice any heat at all. The burger came on a brioche roll with the cheese, roasted shallots, sautéed mushrooms, and roasted garlic aioli. It was an awesome combination. Juicy burger and a great complement of toppings. I got two huge coconut onion rings for a side with some horseradish aioli. These rings were so thick! Putting them together, each order could have been about half an onion. The aioli was a great dipping sauce, the horseradish was really potent on the back end.For three burgers, an app, and five draft beers, our total was just under $100, not bad at all. I have no interest in sushi, so I can't testify to its quality. I can't say my experience was flawless. But in terms of unique burgers and beverages, it's absolutely worth checking out. And I think next time, I need to try a shake."}, {"review_id": "_d74BJw_0H-Fawz6wbE8Jg", "user_id": "VZsPfTXTjTAFbNa4gq21OA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "This place was very nice and the food and cocktails very good, but because they do not take reservations, we wouldn't go back.Arriving at 5:15 and not being seated for 2 hours is not worth my time.

I tried to visit the location in Charlotte, but the wait was over 2 hours. Needless to say, I finally got my chance. The restaurant is a little hidden. I drove by it twice before I spotted the location. Parking is great and there is plenty. The wait was about 25 minutes, which wasn't too bad. We sat down and because I'd already perused the menu...I knew what I wanted. I ordered a house salad, veggie burger and fries. I didn't realize the salad would be as large as it was. I could have not ordered the fries. Also, I shared a dessert and it was so delicious. We ordered the tall cake. I would definitely go back. It's more of a family place, so probably not the best place if you're looking for a more intimate dining experience."}, {"review_id": "SwboIkfTTHF1dn4KySsdew", "user_id": "kQGIMp_2UEgGq0IPETFQSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "I love, love the option of creating my own sushi roll!

A place at the bar miraculously appeared and due to reasonably attentive servers that were running around. I had a drink, a bison burger and was out the door in about an hour - terrific!The bison burger looks amazing, they don't hide the patty. It was hot, fresh and juicy. Truly, the first bite, all the planets aligned and I had to close my eyes and bask.

They do accept reservations but it is a check-in process through an app. About 30 minutes before arriving, we checked into the app to put our name on the list. It didn't note how long of a wait there was; but, we were hoping it wouldn't be very long.When we got to the restaurant and told the employee that we checked in via the app, he told us there would be a 2 hour wait. Ah!! Having gone here previously, we knew that bar seating was first come, first serve. We asked if we could do that and he said yes.We stood around the bar area for a bit to see if any tables were open. The place was PACKED. The waiting area, the bar, everything. Luckily, we found a spot to stand and waited behind a couple who were just getting ready to leave. They leaned over to offer us their table. Of course we were super grateful and accepted; but, we did catch some glares from other guests who had likely been waiting a while. The waiter had also encouraged us to sit at the table. Our waiter was fabulous and the service was so quick. We had our food out in no time - even with them being so busy. He caught me taking pictures of the food for Yelp, hehe! The food is really delicious and different; so, I definitely encourage people to give this restaurant a try. Just beware that you may be waiting for quite some time if you don't snag a table in the bar area. There's a lot to do (shopping, bottle shop, bowling) right around the restaurant to pass the time."}, {"review_id": "YUEakuyQ3B2i3sR9MEdZag", "user_id": "bzTummv6l894ygxdSB-aQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I had heard a lot about this place so I had to try it out myself, the food was sooooo good!
