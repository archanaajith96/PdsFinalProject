Their service is phenomenal; they frequently check in, offer assistance, keep drinks filled, and provide large portions of their high-quality food. Yeah, the price is a bit high, but it's worth it for a really nice date-night with my wife! Their take-out (ordering online) is Absolutely.the.BEST. My wife and I appreciate the convenience of ordering online before leaving work and it being ready for us as we stop by on the way home. Even with ordering to-go, they are kind and friendly."}, {"review_id": "AE5EvjEKGzaiBsUohleMKQ", "user_id": "IxC_jYxhtmJD8JqZHfSOOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Great ambiance, great food.

At first, we weren't too impressed but we slowly got hooked. They have a pretty good selection of items. Pretty much what you'll see at other places. Some dishes to definitely try (but since it's a buffet, it's pretty safe to try everything) are a tofu scramble, chili chicken, potato cakes, and their bhature-fry bread. I like how when they have fresh naan they bring it around to the tables first before they deposit it on the buffet. For the most part, their customer service is spot on, keeping drinks filled. If you order tea, it does take a bit of time. Minor quips- I wish they would list what items they have each day, we tried to find a pattern but doesn't seem like there is one. I also wish the buffet price was listed and whether a drink is included."}, {"review_id": "tc6NQbK7xYp7AUqPWG0Smg", "user_id": "99XCrbxA9CD9cEDhnDNJLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "My husband and I randomly decided to eat here one day a couple years ago, and every time we've passed by it since I kept saying we needed to go back. We finally did for my birthday dinner and I am SO glad! It was a busy Friday night so we had to wait a while, but it was so worth it. The experience is very authentic and the food is absolutely delicious. You HAVE to try the mango or strawberry lassi (I believe that's how you spell it, it's a yogurt drink)...it's like drinking \"nectar of the gods\" as I call it! Also make sure you get some of their naan, any flavor. I've only tried the traditional chicken dishes but we've loved everything we've tasted. If you're not into spicy, heads up - choose the mild! Even the medium is pretty hot, but the mild is definitely good for any taste buds. So so so yummy and we'll definitely be back sooner this time!"}, {"review_id": "BHtzGWe2LMa_vO7h4Ki71A", "user_id": "5rnGhI0yGDlxeijoEYMXZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Excellent food options for vegetarians and vegans too.

There were 6 non veg entrees compared to 4 for veggie, disappointing, if you are a vegetarian.But the disappointment does not stop here, it lingers on through the end of the meal. I have never ever had a preparation of dal makhani (lentil) with big paneer cubes in it. That's an awful combination coz you have to spoon out the paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in order to enjoy the yummy dal. I tried to eat the cheese with mint chutney but it was so bland. One of the veggies was 'kadi' which is essentially a buttermilk curry. This particular dish contained way too many pakoras which made the kadi difficult to relish. Cauliflower dish, naan and aloo tiki are tasty. Ironically, there was naan and bhatura for bread but no chick peas to accompany the bhature. I wonder if this is how things go every day. Maybe, it was the spoiled dough which they reused by deep frying it into bhaturas. Because, the bhaturas tasted a bit sour. For the buffet, food items are not labeled and or placed in order. If you are a vegetarian, you may get confused as they bring in new stuff and place it just anywhere they can place the container.I am tired writing about the main course.Let's talk about dessert as that's more exciting.The rice pudding (Kheer) was like 0/10. Either the kheer itself was too old or they simply used cooked old white rice and added it to milk with sugar.There were no condiments or dry fruits in kheer which is irrelevant at this point, because the rice tasted like pieces of small stones.The mango rice had no mango flavor in it, and was again like eating dry flakes of uncooked rice. So I have literally no idea about what they meant to serve in mango rice.Gulabjamun was either uncooked or I could not figure out what it was supposed to be.So, after being so patient, I lost my cool and gave up even trying gajar ka halwa. But my husband stated that it was also too soggy and tasteless. It appears that they are cutting big corners.All in all, dessert food is extremely low quality and inedible to a great extent.I wonder people have not gotten sick eating  some of he food that is served here."}, {"review_id": "QtKDN9hCd--_7bACY7KvwA", "user_id": "rzzgLQwXQVHmDCm8Ai9xQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Polite wait staff. Nice comfortable atmosphere. We ordered lamb tabdoori (with raita on the side), chicken coconut korma, and garlic naan. The rice that comes with is also delicious. The wait for the food was a little slow especially considering they weren't very busy when we went but not a big deal. Lamb was also a little drier than I hoped for but doused with raita was still very tasty. If you're sensitive to spicy food then get the lowest amount of spice. I like spicy food and got medium heat which was a perfect amount of spiciness for me.

Enjoy really bad BO from some of the servers5. Ask for the check and no one understands you6. Wait 5 min at the front desk to pay since no one brought you the check7. Enjoy a serious gastrointestinal blow out 5 hours later for everyone in your party that leaves your evening and plumbing ruinedDon't let the awards at the entrance fool you, this is not the Indian restaurant you are looking for.

When I got the food home, it was hot and delicious. It came with a generous side of white rice (mixed with carrots or something?). Everything was perfect. I'm a spice wuss so I ordered it all mild, and it something was just a teeny bit hotter than I would call \"mild,\" but honestly, I liked it.
