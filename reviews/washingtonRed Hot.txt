The food menu keeps it to hot dogs, sausages, a couple of sandwiches, and some vegan options. There are a couple of sides to go with it, and everything I've had off of the menu has been damn delicious. My personal go-tos from the hot dog part of the menu are definitely the Hound Dog (hot dog with peanut butter and bacon), the 6th Ave. Strut (Cream cheese, onion, and tomato true to Seattle Dog style), and the Rainier Reuben (1000 island, spicy brown mustard, swiss, and sauerkraut). If you're a fan of sauerkraut, you can't miss the Rainier Reuben!And for the love of all that is holy - get the nachos and ask for some extra napkins. You'll be glad you did! Don't even get me started on the beer - their list is always full of amazing beers from all across the style map. I love a good IPA and a puckering sour, and they've always got options. My more stout-minded friends also always have something to try there, as does every person I bring there. If you're in the area, TRH is a can't-miss spot that'll leave you with a happy belly and maybe even a little bit of a buzz.

It's awesome (yet again!). I got my North End Not Dog, veg, with a side of sauerkraut. Everything is so reasonably priced, good for vegetarians, vegans, and meat eaters, and the staff is super prompt and friendly. I also got a lavender cider, which was delicious. So, for two dogs, a side of beans, sauerkraut, and a cider, our bill was less than 20 bucks.

They keep it fairly straightforward here. But, there's certainly more to it than that--you probably could make all of this stuff at home, but Red Hot offers a wide variety of creative hot dogs and drinks, and serves them up in a friendly, fun, casual environment where hipsters and sportsball fans alike seem right at home.Not only do the ballers and the beardos coexist here, but also the carnivores and the vegans! The menu has this, that and the other kind of meaty hot dog, but we were here for the nifty selection of vegan dogs. Red Hot serves several types of Field Roast (yay!) sausages with all kinds of cool combos of toppings. GF got the Veganerwurst and I got the Kommisar (don't turn around, uh-oh...). Both of these dogs were Old World-inspired (think sauerkraut plus other Germanic goodies); they were tasty and heaping with toppings, served on fluffy poppy seed buns. We also got some Fritos on the side and washed it down with a draft root beer.Looking forward to returning to try some of the other vegan dogs and exploring the extensive micro beer list. Bonus points for being two doors down from Ice Cream Social."}, {"review_id": "BzCcS6wt60Sj6cObY_PCPQ", "user_id": "VLMoj6fovhYVEZWOaPiAcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Late night eats!

Chili is the equivalent of corned beef sweet mush with no beans. If they make it in house they definitely shouldn't. Hot dogs are flavorless and dry. You get what you pay for here. Cheap food, cheap taste, pretty presentation to cover it up. Waitress was unengaged and distant. Asked for a side of cilantro and this is what I got. That's like asking for some sugar on the side with your coffee and being given one. Overall disappointing experience.

Me not being from the area, it was pretty easy to find. The establishment itself is a pretty decent size, lacks luster in the interior and a bit dark but hey what are you gonna do. Customer service is what you should expect it to be, friendly and helpful, nothing over the top. It is obviously a bar type place but I only had one mission: to order food. They have a good selection of food, not too much variety of different types, it's mainly hotdogs but still not bad. I already knew what I wanted to order which was something off of the vegan menu. I got the North End Not Dog and wow wow wow was I impressed! You most certainly could trick someone into thinking it is a regular hotdog, but with much more flavor!! They use a vegan bratwurst and man is that the star of the show. Toppings are perfect on this particular hotdog, minus the relish. The peppers on it really top it off and just makes an explosion on flavor in your mouth when you bite into it. Price is eh, $5.00 before tax for a hotdog, but it is definitely quality food that they use. The food alone gave it a 5 star for me but the reason for the missing star is that they don't have any type of sides (French fries, tater tots, etc.) which is a bummer because who actually likes to eat a hotdog by itself??This is obviously isn't going to be an every week stop in for me because I live minimum 30 min away. I really wish they had a location in Seattle as well but whenever my mouth is watering for a vegan hotdog, I now know where to go!"}, {"review_id": "qbVhr1tCNxzLhgaZ0T9G-A", "user_id": "kXWgIZlMeXXsC7_A0QtdnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Decided to try a new place tonight and came across Red Hot on Yelp. Fun little bar with a relaxed feel. Server was straightforward about the kitchen closing when we arrived, food runner was also friendly. Great menu with something for everyone including vegan hot dogs. Tons of craft beers and ciders on tap. Hubby had the Portland Concord Grape cider and I had the Ghostfish white ale (not on tap). We enjoyed the Filthy Nachos with grilled onions and The Red Hot and Destiny City Slawdog. A little spendy for a hot dog, but a fun atmosphere and great beers made this a place we'd come back to try some more of the menu."}, {"review_id": "9oVk9_IVaQCT2-Eshng4OA", "user_id": "6J4xAbZd3tzjBGDQkuO8-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "There's nothing bad to say about this place at all!

It's not only functioning on all cylinders, but it's knocking it out of the park at the same time. Those two analogies have nothing to do with each other, but that's how awesome this place is.***BJCP Beer Judge review***Incredible beer selection. This is not your everyday average craft beer offering you see at many places. Whoever is doing the beer purchasing KNOWS beer, and they have some truly legendary offerings on tap at all times.The hot dogs here are as delicious as they are creative. I think at this point we've tried over half of the dogs, and my current favorite is the salsa verde... runner up is the peanut butter bacon dog (the Hound Dog I think). We tried a slamwich last time, and it was good too from what I remember.The icing on the cake is the late night breakfast they do Sunday nights. Their pancakes are just as bomb as the rest of their food. Still have yet to try their brunch on the weekends, but we have extremely high hopes based on everything else.Easily deserves to be in the discussion for best beer bar in Tacoma.
