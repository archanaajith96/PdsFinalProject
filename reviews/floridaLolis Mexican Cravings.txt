To be honest it was the best meal I had in Tampa during my entire stay and the whole meal cost me less than $12.The al pastor was absolutely lucious with that pineapple flavor mixed in. The carmarones had a tang that awakened my senses. When I bit into the carne asada, Drake came down on a cloud and sang me a lullaby into heaven. Service was so friendly and efficient. This place is seriously legit. 900+ Reviews and 4.5 stars don't lie."}, {"review_id": "8Zo6-mGmZ7f-EA3LIGLr8Q", "user_id": "JQhJdV-Y9hxGf306AlSjYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "A no frills Taco shop, you order at the counter and sit in picnic style tables. The air conditioning is a portable unit and theres hardly any room to stand inside. It's in a busy road with a dirt parking lot in the middle of nowhere.They don't have a self serve salsa stand or club cards, promotions, combos, catering, or a guacamole cart that comes to your table. None of it.So why the 5 stars? Because who gives a shit. You're coming here for some bomb ass tacos and that's exactly what you'll get. The carne asada here is made with rib eye. It's perfectly marinated and tender and makes for one of the best carne asada tacos I've ever had. Layer on a bit of lime and their green salsa for the perfectly tangy carne asada taco experienceCarnitas: tender and juicy. Not too fatty and certainly not a bite went to waste.Chicken: my least favorite of the tacos here. It's not bad but it's also not the greatest chicken taco around so I'll probably skip it next time. It was a bit dry and didn't have much flavor.Pastor: oh man they got this one almost perfect. The pork is seasoned just right and they lay on a slice of seared (?) pineapple on top. It was a perfect combination of spice and sweet. The tortillas are made here fresh, so is the salsa. I actually will occasionally make the drive out just to eat here it's that good.You just can't go wrong with these tacos, so don't taco bout it and go get some and see for yourself."}, {"review_id": "x5Z3Kyh7vH4VftfFNQBWFw", "user_id": "nok8EGzOP8NTefKcR1EG4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "As everyone else has indicated, it IS in fact the best mexican food in Tampa. The place is extremely small, relative to the number of customers they get. This does lead to parking problems, especially during busy times (lunch and dinner). The wait can be as long as 30 minutes as well to get your food.Okay, enough of the cons. The pros drastically outweigh the cons. The food is absolutely amazing! My favorite tacos are lengua, campechano, pastor and ribeye. Delicious meat over freshly made tortillas! Tamales are on point as well.Try it for yourself.

Not only are the tacos cheap, but full of flavor and spices! We ordered the Ribeye, Pork, and Chicharron. The food was made and brought out extremely quick included with your tacos, there's also a side of the green sauce, red sauce, onions, and lime. The green and red sauce complemented the tacos so well, I had to dip my taco in before each bite. The inside is a bit smaller if you want to dine in and there is also outside seating, but they also have the option to take out if you're on the go. One of the best tacos I have eaten, anyone who is in the area or stops by in Tampa needs to try these tacos out. If you're not in the mood for tacos they also quesadillas, sopes, and tortas to choose from! Especially with the price point for the amazing food you'll be eating it is definitely a place to stop by. Can't wait to come back when I stop by in Tampa again"}, {"review_id": "3giu2rBzPA6c7iCo0ZCTEw", "user_id": "nAsPdQylvJb3bX-ViC7hXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "What can I say about this place .

I've always said Tacos El Rancho in Orlando were thee best tacos I've ever had and the tacos at Lolis were either as good or better. I ordered the lengua, pastor, and fish tacos.

Many options to choose from.  Just pick one.  They are all good.  They come with a green and red sauce.  The green is amazing.  Spicy and sweet.  Good fresh flavor.  The tamales are amazing.  Heads up.  Sometimes the sell out.  Get there early."}, {"review_id": "Dj8s4ZWwJ4Gfi_-L9_NqpQ", "user_id": "BHxAC6N1iv2TrRKik4uPgQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "The price point is awesome. For less than $3 bucks you can get a flavorful taco with a spicy green sauce and a sweeter red sauce. Please note seating is limited so be prepared to wait for a table. Great spot for no frills tacos. Parking is also somewhat limited so you can park next door in the gravel lot. A lot of people ordered rice milk with the tacos. The rice milk here is super sweet. It's not bad, just a little too sweet for me. The tacos come with a soft shell and cilantro and onions.

I ordered 3 tacos: chicharron, ribeye, and fish and a side of retried beans and horchata. It's hard to know what you're going to get with chicharron, this place did pork rinds. They were alright. Lots of toppings certainly helped. I would prefer pork belly. The ribeye was alright - not as flavorful as a carne Saad's or some other steak option. The taco was a little dry - I guess you could add toppings to fix that - but they were already a little pricey.Fish taco was the better one. Solid fish and toppings. It was almost near the quality of Cali Tacos, but Cali Tacos in my past expedience is superior (it's been awhile so I could be wrong).The tacos weren't bad - they just weren't that impressive either. The side of refried beans came in a tiny container - it was good, but a better portion would've been better.Probably the thing dragging down this review the most was the horchata. I'm from California and horchata is really important to me. The horchata here was syrupy and didn't have a good flavor to it. It almost tasted like powder and I started coughing after drinking it.Order total was around $14 which isn't that cheap for tacos and a drink.Overall, Loli's is definitely not a bad place for Mexican food, but definitely not the best in Tampa. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there."}, {"review_id": "IHH49qqAY9gQrkKWmvCmoA", "user_id": "TeZ6d0EWdIfQWR3dS0RboA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Best tacos in all of Tampa!  Every time I've come here during the busy time of day it's been well worth the wait.  Try the fish tacos--- best I've ever had."}, {"review_id": "cep9ziOi8FKIfNpIskGzYw", "user_id": "3HFMEAMA9xU8B47UIODONg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "I tried Lolis Mexican Cravings at the Yelp Fairytale Masquerade party on Sunday. My husband and I visited them once before at there Benjamin Rd. location last Fall but I neglected to leave review. Lolis stood out at the Yelp party because they were cooking the tacos \"to order!\" and offering custom toppings. I happened to be standing next to two folks who did not want cilantro on their tacos (a Mexican herb as common as salt to us) so they re-cooked their tacos on the spot and added no cilantro for them. I really appreciated the custom \"made to order\" tacos. Many of the other vendors were serving cold food. This was no bueno. Lolis were fresh and oh-so tasty. I had 2 chicken tacos but I know they are all yummy. They had 3 sauces from super hot - to their mild tomatillo sauce (green). My husband and I will definitely be visiting Lolis in the near future!

It's probably because my hands are too busy shoveling tacos from Loli's into my mouth for me to write or do anything else. All I can say is that street taco establishments can sometimes be few and far between in some areas, and Loli's is pretty much the perfect cure for any taco craving. And considering how tacos are to Millennials what meatloaf is to Baby Boomers, I felt it my civic duty to report on the significance of my findings at Loli's Mexican Cravings. I've lived in West Tampa for the past 8 years now, and I've been to all of the Mexican restaurants worth mentioning in the Tampa Bay area -- from fast food to hole-in-the-wall. My Mexican cravings usually have to come with a schedule, because there really aren't that many impressive taco joints around me. We have the usual \"favorites\" like Tijuana Flatts, Chipotle, and Taco Bell. But let's face it, those are all \"fast food\" choices.Enter Loli's. This was a house that is now a taco factory. Okay, it isn't literally a taco factory, but it might as well be. This is a well-kept \"secret\" off Benjamin Road, sandwiched between Waters Ave. and Hillsborough Ave. If you're in the West Tampa region, and you haven't yet tried Loli's, you are missing out on something that will surely satisfy your taco cravings. Their menu is simple - tacos, quesadillas, the usual. But there's something about the way they prepare their tortillas that has such a fresh, flavorful flavor. These are as close to authentic as I think we can get in the area. I've technically never had a taco from Mexico, but if they are anything like the way Loli's makes them, then I'll need a new airline rewards account. The tacos are relatively bite-sized - maybe about 3 or 4 bites per taco. The price point is fair. The venue itself can get a little claustrophobic when it's crowded, but I think that's what makes this taco experience endearing in a way. And the staff is all-around fairly quick considering how busy this place can get at times. Come to Loli's for a most-excellent taco experience."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/lolis-mexican-cravings-tampa?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
