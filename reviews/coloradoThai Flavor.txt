But it was luke warm - not hot as it shud be. Service is negative 5 stars. They dropped off the food and basically walked away. We needed bowls and some hot sauce so we had to request that but they didn't even stop by our table, we had to make our request as they were walking by! Literally didnt stop while we made our request. They didn't stop to check on us, if we needed anything else. Ordered a Thai tea that we never got... But they didn't forget it on the check! We aren't paying for stuff we didn't get. I expect servers to stop by ur table and check on your meal and ask if everything is as it shud be and if you need anything else -- That wud be a 5 star service that deserves a 20% tip. They mostly care about getting orders from customers so that they can just get some $$. Cheap cheap cheap. Food is ok...nothing to write home about. We got siriracha noodles, peanut sauce with tofu, Thai flavor with chicken. 40$ for watever food, 0 service, and no drinks.. Want good Thai food?? Do urself, ur tastebuds, and ur wallet a favor and go to Tommy thai or pearl of Siam. Will not be back. Now we will go get real food and dessert somewhere else."}, {"review_id": "G7qQaXXo4rRQ0nPZdax8Aw", "user_id": "DOXC-_siuEjvKSHMG8X6aw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/22/2017", "text": "Today was my fourth or maybe fifth visit to Thai Flavor. Although their food it not the best Thai food I've had (never been to Thailand, but I've had better Thai food in Manila), Thai Flavor is the best Thai restaurant in the Boulder-Denver area. We love to order the larbs, the eggplant stir-fry, the pineapple fried rice, and the crispy Catfish salad. Today I ordered the Crispy Catfish Salad and the pork larb. As always, the food was great.I would have given the restaurant four stars, but there was a server today that was very unpleasant. She's not a waitress. She's an older woman who serves water, cleans the tables, and goes around calling everyone \"Honey.\" She likes to chat with customers, which is fine. But often her stories contain a lot of information about herself that seems improper to talk about in a restaurant. Anyhow, she came over to my table and said--as I was enjoying my fresh coconut juice--(you know, from a real coconut), \"I would never order that in a restaurant. In my country we eat that at home. Look at you, aren't you having a hard time? You should never order that in a restaurant!\"There's probably some sort of transliteration going on, or maybe she isn't quite \"there,\" but to me that was just plain rude."}, {"review_id": "r077B5OMSmFHR2jW6wi8Yw", "user_id": "46Wi08T5D3phf3SMgi7U3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "I can't say this is the best Thai food I've ever had. I can say that the quality is good, you get plenty of food and it's cheap, cheap, cheap. Come for the lunch special which has a number of dishes priced at $7.99. I'm pretty basic when it comes to Thai and always judge a Thai restaurant based on the Pad Thai or Drunken Noodles. Since said noodles are not part of the lunch special, I have opted for the chicken and pork Pad Thai respectively and have been pleased. As for the ambiance, it's nothing fancy. After all this is a restaurant in a plaza, right next door to a pizzeria. As for service, their goal is to get your food to you quick, refill those drinks and have you on your way. It has never been particularly busy but this seems like a place that gets a fair share of the lunch crowd. They seem to know that and it's appreciated. P.S. There is a $10 minimum for debit and credit cards. This can easily be achieved by ordering a lunch special and sharing an appetizer. For $10, this is money well spent."}, {"review_id": "69w1JZqJtsgDVU2Hp1eGHg", "user_id": "7wFfX-ON141OM7Gw8q0v0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "Usually in this part of town for Korean food.  It's a bit of a drive for us and there are some great Thai places near Denver (e.g. Thai monkey place on Broadway). We stopped by here because the restaurant we originally planned for had a 1.5 hour wait (*cough* Aki *cough*) and really glad we did!I got my usual, the chicken Pad Thai, medium spicy. This place has a nice spice gauge fitting to what I'd expect.  Authentic at a spicy level I can do.  Their medium is a little less spicy than Thai Monkey, but definitely has a kick compared to Aloy Thai downtown.  The portions were huge and I had to pack some home.  Price is reasonable. We went for dinner but did read that they have great lunch pricing. This place is located in a small separate plaza really close to the Pacific Ocean plaza.

In fact, I have yet to find a better papaya salad at any Thai restaurant in Denver. The service here is extremely fast considering it is a small family business. The restaurant is decked out in Thai decoration making for a quality dining atmosphere. My girlfriend and I ordered papaya salad, chicken Tom yum soup, and chicken pad Thai. The papaya was fresh and prepared with ample amounts of onion and tomato. The chicken Tom yum had just the right amount of sour to complement the sweet sauce of the chicken pad Thai. The servings are large and more than capable of feeding two hungry people. I love this Thai restaurant!

Judge a book by its cover if you will, but I am telling you, you will be MISSING OUT. This thai place is the BEST I have had in Denver. Audacious words, I know. But I have gone here for the past 6 years and it has consistently been amazing. I love their drunken noodles and any of their curries (panang is my fave but green is also bomb!). But the one thing that makes them stand out leagues above competition is their thai iced tea. It gets NO better than this. Generous portions, the perfect combo of milk and tea.... It is to DIE for! I always get Thai Medium which is enough to make you wipe your nose a few times and finish your glass of water. Its perfect for me.

I was happy to be one of the first reviewers for this place. I did love this place until we had a breakup, the honeymoon phase is over. Experiencing subpar service, raising prices on this growing economy, I understand; but, the cherry on top was when I ordered takeout during lunch, was never informed assuming it would be lunch price like it had been the past 7 years I've been here, well it wasn't. I received what was a lunch portion for $13 of Pad Thai that was gravy-sweet. I was then informed the lunch price is only valid for dine-in only, pretty unfair for those that can't afford the luxury of sitting in and dining, but either have school or work to tend to. Sorry guys, there are a  lot more options in Aurora for Thai, I'd go exploring if I were you."}, {"review_id": "okRLgKR6C-N5el-rrOwnXA", "user_id": "VmmNe5oqovR_9e0hkvILUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/7/2017", "text": "Well this place is really good.Solid, authentic, family run Thai.

It was the perfect weeknight option; the food was ready in less than 15 minutes, and the portions were big enough for my husband and I to eat well and take leftovers for lunch the next day.The flavors really wowed us. My dad, who always complains about food not being spicy enough, ordered Pad Thai that was truly \"Thai Hot.\" He was not disappointed, in fact he even got up after a bite to grab a cold beverage to cool off his mouth. My husband got drunken noodles and they were absolutely delicious as well. I was happy he chose hot, because the spice was more manageable for me. The only part of our meal that was less than fabulous was the dumplings. I would bet money that they came from a sack in the freezer. Service was awesome.

Service is quick and polite, dining area is clean and tasteful. The hot food is actually hot (spicy).

My favorite is the stirfry with Thai (baby?) eggplant, peppers and garlic which I get with the shrimp. I have no idea what is in that oily brown sauce but I can't get enough of it. Great cream cheese wontons too!The lunch special here is mediocre, but it's basically the same chicken thigh/rice/cheap veggies and sugary sauce with a spring roll you will find at any Chinese restaurant for $7, so stop being so damn cheap and get one of the regular $10 dishes and you won't regret it."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-flavor-aurora-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
