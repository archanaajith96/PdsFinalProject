Perfect for dinner that is healthy, and still leaves you wanting more (that's why you should get baklava to go) The owner is friendly and welcoming.

I walked in here at 6pm on a Wednesday night, and there wasn't another soul in here. That's their loss. Anyway, this place is a tiny -- and I do mean tiny -- gap in the middle of a strip mall on the border between Fargo and West Fargo. Tiny in that it may seat 40 people if packed like sardines. On this night, golden 1950s rock tunes were playing over the loudspeaker -- not what I was expecting but I'll take it.The chef gives you a nice explanation of the six main dishes -- chicken, beef, or lamb kabobs; Italian crab cake burger; or beef or lamb Mediterranean burgers.  I knew I wasn't having either of the two lamb dishes, so I went with the chicken kabob plate. It comes with rice and Mediterranean salad. Heaven.What else did I find? Moroccan tea, which I have specifically never heard of, is a nicely spiced hot tea, served in a fancy little tea pot (pictured). Hummus within which you can feel the chick peas, and flavored beautifully. You really should go here and eat. You will not regret it."}, {"review_id": "wOEO06oIn0axpnYNAIt1og", "user_id": "eBSi_YB7h7Xh8EM386f05Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/21/2017", "text": "Like someone else who mentioned, the owner and his customer service is a stellar 10/10. However the food is more like 7/10. The owner is Moroccan and opened this restaurant a year ago. Based on my small talk with him, he runs the place alone and has no help. Kudos to him for multitasking all aspects of the kitchen. I ordered the beef kebabs and substituted rice for salad. In addition I got hummus with pita. The hummus was good but lacked flavor. The texture was less creamy as other places. The beef kebab was a little dry but had good flavor. For the quality and quantity of food, it's expensive. 3 thin skewers of beef on some salad and a small side of hummus with a pita was $18."}, {"review_id": "GdYb3b6IplTr0twgRH3E8w", "user_id": "muuKQ633S3ptipokfmg12Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2017", "text": "What a great experience. Came for the first time to enjoy lunch and got a warm reception from the owner. The restaurant was busy but not packed. The decor is bright but plain. It appears to be a counter order but we were seated and provided with delicious green/mint tea and homemade hummus. It was nice and course, not over refined. There were toasted sesame seeds, fresh garlic and lemon juice. The pita was to perfection on the grill. Yummy !I tried the lamb kabobs with Greek salad and saffron rice. The salad was fresh with crisp lettuce, sweet tomatoes and tangy white onions. The dressing is a light balsamic (not overpowering) with generous oregano and other spices. The saffron rice is perfectly cooked with a slight firmness, not mushy at all. Very delicate flavor. The lamb was charred nicely, tender, juicy and fresh. Good spices with a hint of mint. Beautiful. My wife enjoyed chicken kabobs which were tasty, flavorful and delicious. The food and drinks are served on proper China and glassware with metal silverware. Clearly the proprietor knows how to prepare food, serve food, great customers and make a restaurant which is much more than the sum of its parts. A highly recommended restaurant."}, {"review_id": "hkPBo80KdINmqeNup8y3Eg", "user_id": "rDXR7r3q5DXX-xFUx0tx1A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/9/2017", "text": "HOT SKEWERS! NO WARNING!My fiance and I went here this afternoon to grab a bite to eat. She had an orange soda and lamb cabobs. While the food was fairly good and the owner was nice, when he brought her food out to her he gave no warning whatsoever how hot the lamb skewers were. Which all business owners need to do. In the process she grabbed it and it left a blister on her thumb.

Hummus was fresh and the pita bread was soft and fresh. I ordered the Lamb Kabobs while the wife ordered a Mediterranean Beef burger. Both of our dishes were served with a side salad. Lamb kabobs, well flavored, and served on a bed of rice. Beef burger, served on a pretzel bun, was cooked to perfection. The pretzel buns are delivered from small outfit in Wisconsin and are awesome. Portion sizes are perfect. We finished all of our food, but did not feel like we overate. A very small menu to choose from, but that is a good thing.
