Lol), this is the place to go. My husband & I went & got the combo platter full-fed plate for both of us. It came with hush puppies, pickles onion, fries, cream corn, & 4 4-8 oz. of your protein ... we asked for 3 sides of lean brisket, & 1 of hickory smoked sausage. Sausage has cheese inside so i personally didn't like it but my husband did. The cream corn, the closest thing i can describe it to you is if you've ever been to Bill Millers Its Kinda the same as their sweet corn but it has a little twist to it because they put pieces of jalapeños here & the corn is also a little tooo soft. But still good."}, {"review_id": "qDv18HCT4DuBPPVIIJpeVA", "user_id": "ExVdMMgUKftrRZLJo2lwkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Service was quick and friendly. The food came out fast! A friend, who was not hungry, ordered fries with pulled pork that was in the appetizer menu and love it! She had lunch and still took half of the dish home. It was huge!!!I was expecting a bit more for my ribs. They were well seasoned but not fall of the bone as I would have liked them to be. The pork burned ends on the other hand..... I could eat a family size portion of it and would ask for more!!!! The fatty bits were perfectly balanced with the meaty soft bits. The sauce it was tossed in was sweet, salty and tangy. Amazing!!! For sides - sweet potatoes fries, can't go wrong with anything fried and baked beans."}, {"review_id": "cA0c-Pkz0h_f5mIJYD9Dow", "user_id": "aXM_xP5wxS6sHazC2GP4fw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Hearing how great this place was on yelp and the people who ate here, I was disappointed about this BBQ place. Me and my boyfriend are huge fans of BBQ and have tasted multiple places to get. The wait time wasn't long so that was pretty great. However, it took then a whole hour to take our food out. I was so disappointed because we had to eat so fast. In addition, the food wasn't my favorite. I honestly think the food was ok but not the best I have eaten. The waiter was sweet and ended up giving us a free dessert because of the wait that ended up being the best thing of the night.

This place showed up as highly rated so we went! The parking lot was packed but we found parking on the back side of the building. We decided to split the 'Well Fed' combo with ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket. It didn't look like much food at first but ended up being enough for 2. The ribs were definitely the winner of the day. So tender and tangy; bbq'ed to perfection! Next up was the brisket, a little fatty but good nonetheless. The pulled pork was next; very tender and flavorful. I didn't really care for the pulled chicken. It lacked tenderness and flavor in my opinion. The Mac n cheese was delicious! Very cheesy! The sweet potato fries were tasty and crunchy. I definitely recommend giving this place a try. Our waitress was great. The space was great and there looked to be a rooftop deck as well."}, {"review_id": "t-f-vQKd3okhS5LcFWCecw", "user_id": "QanV5AtttYtMFfzX6x1-SQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "So I thought I had good BBQ before but now I really really know I had good BBQ. A short wait for our party of six, we ordered the nachos with chicken for an appetizer. They had a little kick to them! Very tasty! I took the bartender's advice and got the \"burnt ends\" which are amazing nuggets of carmelized brisket with BBQ sauce. I am not a huge beef fan but I could be if I had this meal choice available to me all the time. So incredibly tender and delicious. And oh my goodness those BBQ beans! A must have. I also got to try some of my dinner mates collard greens. A first for me. They kind of tasted like spinach with a thicker texture. Not bad! Oh and those hush puppies. I never really had a hush puppy that I thought tasted good. I didn't realize why people even ate those until now!! The ginger lemon jack drink was so yummy! Great food and great service!  I'm so full and happy right now."}, {"review_id": "L77C6_MR62PPHIZCzij0Vg", "user_id": "TviI9ML9TJmA0BBRclweeQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "And this is why I am fat. For real. Pimento cheese fries topped with brisket? You have got to be kidding me.Between the beer, fries, BBQ sampler and banana pudding (yes, dessert too) it didnt take long for me to start hating myself. The only redemption I had was that everything we ordered was shared- but still.I really love pimento, its a little weird and I think you have to get used to it, but it was sooo good on the crinkle fries. The little char from the broil just made it better, and topping it with brisket put it way over the top to the gluttonous side. So obviously I liked it!For our shared main we split the sampler, where we had a chance to try their smoked meats along with some sides. The smoked veggies were awesome- one of the more surprising flavors of what we ordered-and I would order double of those next time. I got the mac and cheese as our second side, but after those fries that was way too heavy and too much cheese. Out of the two, the fries win hands down.Meat wise I preferred the pulled pork and the chicken, though everything was quite good! I've got a thing for banana pudding so if I see it I order it, and I am keeping a mental list of best ones around the country. This one comes in third place! Yum! (Magnolia's in NYC is still in first place, if you are curious).Everything here was good, but not mindblowing. I was also a little underwhelmed by the service and the bar staff, they were not very attentive (no, it was not very busy). We also had to send two things back, one was incorrect and the other cold (the mac, which made it a bit gloppy and unappealing the first time around). Overall quite good, but not a \"must go back asap\", for me."}, {"review_id": "49HystTX8rf8zG8iP6Y2EA", "user_id": "6dpLXShP-do8bDCEglovbQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Excited to try this place given all the reviews.  Got on the waitlist on Yelp.  My table was ready but I couldn't be seated without half my party there and my coworkers were late arriving.  The hostess was very accommodating and didn't give away my table.Service was OK.  Our appetizers arrived before our drinks.  My drink was $3 off for the daily drink special and the contents reflected that... barely any alcohol, and pretty much a cup of crished ice water.I ordered the burnt ends with Mac n cheese and collard greens.  The burnt ends were really good but the sides were just OK.  Some commented the collard greens needed to be drained as there was too much liquid.  The hush puppies had good flavor and were the perfect bite size.  A big disappointment at the table was that they ran out of ribs while we were ordering.  It was probably around 7:30 p.m. Apparently, they run out of ribs every night.  They smoke meat on a daily basis and sell what they have until they run out.For those who ordered the combo plate that comes with ribs, they were asked what they wanted in place of the ribs.  My coworker picked burnt ends and then was up charged for it.  They were not told it would cost more and I think it's ridiculous since they were picking something else because what was part of the entree was not available by the restaurant."}, {"review_id": "z-bQhKphn68swXAHO9gXSQ", "user_id": "9cHXK314MC9Y6nwI6-ehIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Still the best bbq in charlotte!

Our waitress was very rude to us and made multiple smart comments. I didn't catch her name but she was a loud blonde. Yes I appreciate someone who is friendly and joking a bit but you are also suppose to have a level of professionalism. She also took forever to bring us drinks and refills. A wait is understandable but when I see you joking around at other tables and taking your sweet time, I get impatient.The poor service here was unfortunate because this place is worthy of 5 stars. The drink selection was pretty good and included some local beers. I went with Wooden Robot's overachiever which was a nice fruity pale ale. For food we got the brisket queso dip which was yummy and I got the pulled pork with bacon wrapped jalepenos and hush puppiesbfor my entree. The pork was fresh and flavorful, just the way I like it. The sides were a nice compliment to the pork as well.

Midwood is one of the best that Charlotte has to offer. I've been here about 3 more times after 2012 and I have to say the improvement has been drastic. No wonder that Obama came here when he visited Charlotte.This place was thought by my parents to try out, and well because of their dietary restriction/dietary preferences BBQ is always a sure winner. Something that serves fatty keto diet like options will always win them over. What won them over when it came to Midwood was the question: What type of cut would you like? Lean, Fatty, or medium?\" Yep. That was it. The past three times that I have been here, we've ordered the platter and just shared. We also got the jalapeño poppers which was always a treat, however be warned that the spiciness of the peppers can go either way. It could be a little spicy, or it could have a little more kick to it. I guess it just depends on whatever your tolerance is.For the combo option, we ordered 2 briskets, ribs, and sausages with sides of jalapeño peppers and greens as those were always nice to have. And for a pig out feeding us all for $34, it's not a bad price and definitely should be looked at if you have multiple people with you or just two people eating. Service was pretty good, nothing to really say about that, we came during the afternoon so it wasn't horribly busy.Check this place out, the BBQ is good, I would say stick to the briskets, ribs, and wings (if you're looking for chicken). I can't vouch for the pulled pork or the chopped chicken as I haven't had it in a while."}, {"review_id": "is0T4EbtEALtnljdXvG4qQ", "user_id": "0KGCdp9W8jz9KJRsABb66g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Solid as ever; solid as the others.

Beer and drink selection is also great at very reasonable prices. This location is of course still family friendly and very casual.

We were immediately seated by the hostess and waited on.As tourists of the area, Midwood was actually our backup choice for BBQ in the city as we were hoping to try Lexington Barbecue, which was about 40 minutes north, since we had read about its authenticity to the region, but it was closed. On top of it, we had read that Midwood was Texas-style BBQ and not Carolina-style, so we were really hoping for Lexington to be open. With all that said, we saw all of the rave reviews for Midwood (4.5 stars from 1100+ Yelp reviews) and the fact that Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton had dropped in, so we thought it had to be somewhat good, even if it wasn't representative of North Carolina.After a review of the menu, we went with a combo platter of Carolina chopped pork, beef brisket, chopped chicken BBQ and hickory smoked sausage, and a classic BBQ plate of burnt ends. For our sides, we had the hushpuppies, classic mac & cheese, coleslaw and BBQ baked beans. Like I said earlier, everything was good, but nothing was interstellar ridiculously great. The real standouts to us were definitely the brisket, burnt ends and sides. The brisket was very tender and juicy. The burnt ends were fatty on one end and meaty on the other, just the way we like them. We loved all of the sides, not much to complain about there. The sausage was also good, but nothing to write home about. As for the chopped (pulled) pork and the chopped chicken, they were a bit dry, but that was to be expected considering what type of meat they were, so make sure to douse them in lots of the house BBQ sauce. In closing, we liked the down to the Earth atmosphere inside and the modern BBQ restaurant setting. Our waitress wasn't extremely friendly, but she wasn't rude either. They just did their job as expected. Also, other waiters who were wrapping up for the evening passed by during our meal and made small talk so that was appreciated. We just wish we were a bit more enthusiastic about the food after our visit."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/midwood-smokehouse-charlotte?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
