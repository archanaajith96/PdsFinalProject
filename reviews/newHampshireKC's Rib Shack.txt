After skiing in Vermont, my friends and I stopped here on our way back to Boston and this meal sure fueled us up! For the 4 of us, we ordered the shovel and smores! The novelty of the shovel was hilarious but the food in it was superb! The sides were just as good as well! I would recommend doing this, especially if you have a ground of 4-6 people because everyone gets a taste of everything and theres plenty of food to go around! The best part of the night was our extremely attentive server. She had such a great attitude throughout the night.The wait was nonexistent here since the restaurant is huge (although you'd never guess from the outside). The pig decorations are really cute too!"}, {"review_id": "8AUJrPT3IpaelSlnbvREPA", "user_id": "yzVlmiaDFaqZh-3gY4UMsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "This place was just fantastic.  Quick service, great sized portions, amazing smoked food.  Make sure you get the dirty rice and the pig tails.  We had the combo platter for 2, but there was enough food for the 3 of us.  Even my friend's little girl lover her food.  She kept snacking on the pig tails (don't worry they are not really pig's tails).  The brisket was perfect, ribs fell off the bones.  We sat in the main dining room, but we found out later that there is an upstairs sports bar that was really great.  Would love to watch some sports on there.  They also have a Tiki bar that is open in the summer.  The hostess said the outdoor patio is rocking during the summer.The building is soft of set back off the road, but once you get there you will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "1o2GuweXU78e-EAfanku5g", "user_id": "PnLmb9KWLZEZXbIfHB-oug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Whenever we are in the area on Kc's we make it a point to stop in.

Just come here and eat! We had the \"build a pladda\" for one which we shared, pulled pork, brisket and spare ribs with a side of Brunswick stew, beans and slaw. It was a magical, food coma inducing meal which left dazed and confused for the evening. Thank you KC's, it's a damn shame that there is not a place like you where  I am from. P.S: Have the maple bacon ice cream, no really, just do it."}, {"review_id": "I3xKDK1ceHsVJAai5Du2EQ", "user_id": "7z6-X3V4k8IO8t3lU4HtrQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "We wanted to try this place out because it is the only bbq place in manchester (to my knowledge). The outside seating was super nice and the smell of fresh bbq enticing. We ordered the 2 people platter with ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and bbq chicken. The only item worth mentioning is the ribs. The rub used on them was great. Texture was also a good balance, not too hard or soft, great for gnawing on. The other meat items were dry... So disappointing. I'd recommend you just get the ribs... just the ribs."}, {"review_id": "ADZIamGW2POGKxNaiQzb5w", "user_id": "IBPNYI3P09-Kf8sXg2YHlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Best BBQ place in the area.

The 16 piece is plenty to share. We got 1/2 in the house made buffalo & 1/2 in the spicy Caribbean! Both were EXCELLENT...spicy but not like your face was burning off. The sweet cornbread with the wings makes a great side to cool things down. Lots of cool NH vanity plates line the walls."}, {"review_id": "fAXmso7vbxq2cXJHJB_xvw", "user_id": "fU-oPUtA-Oq9On7_ttMFRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Very good Ribs in this restaurant and the Bread best!

I had the pulled pork sandwich and iced tea. The pulled pork is tender and moist. Very good. I would recommend this to anyone. I've had the ribs before and they are delicious, but if you like pulled pork, go for that. Several BBQ sauces to choose from right at your table.

It is a little weirdly set up. The parking lot is to the side of the entrance... which is on the side of the building.. the natural entrance (or where it may be) is where the back kitchen door, dumpsters and leaking trash cans are.. strange and almost immediately offputting. I am not one to stick my nose up at that, but some may. It is in fact one of the very few BBQ spots in the area so they get away with it. Classic rock radio def a plus! Interior decor is confused... old timey barn with jugs and old signs? Orr.. bar area with shiny new metal fencing and hammered on artwork and Ads from wearestartingabbqplaceto… .  Lets just let the food speak for itself then!Plastic silverware... thin plates on plate coasters.. reminiscent of a backyard bbq.. but with air conditioning!  Brisket entree was my meal of choice and the meat itself was good but lacking in smokey seasoning. Sides were passable but next time I may just pass on them altogether. Wings are a good app choice with some brews... but seriously when are they not?What stood out were the different sauces. I particularly loved the spicy sauce - not too hot or too thin! I'll remember this place when we want to come back in the summer time. It was just cold on those metal chairs even in the autumn.. i'd imagine it to be too chilly in the winter.. Speaking of chili I would love to try the chili, it looked good on someone else's table but I just didn't have the room in my belly."}, {"review_id": "mJS8xvOs1t2r-WpEGF9U0g", "user_id": "FJz5dLmUVWVSnmS_bk9Qgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Best bbq sample platter that I've had in a long time.
