Authentic and flavorful this small local owned establishment is no secret. Always filled with people, do yourself a favor & give it a taste. I've tried several of their options. You get a large bowl (I always have leftovers) for $7.25+ a steal if you ask me. It's not a fine dining experience, more of a welcoming, homey atmosphere-if that's your jam you'll love this place.It's become a weekly stop for me."}, {"review_id": "khvAF8hzM58InI5BgU5vTQ", "user_id": "eGPVQgF5-T-pfOmG0Lb4xA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "So fresh and good.

The staff were very nice and it was like being welcomed into a family dinner. Their pho was pretty good. Always a good classic comfort food for a nice cold day!! We also ordered other rice and noodle dishes! Those were really good!! Unfortunately, I can't pronounce the name of the noddle dish but if u show the picture, I'm sure they'll figure it out! But seriously, you must try it!!! I'm adding this dish to my top three must eat Vietnamese food!!"}, {"review_id": "8uDP_EgkllOs6zZ9eM2-Yg", "user_id": "Dgli-CDNjDU0YPthLocL2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Best pho in Bridgeport. I don't know why everyone keeps talking about Pho Saigon down the street when THIS is where it's really at!

I'm finally writing a long overdue review after getting my foot in the door!)Friendly, authentic, can't beat the prices! The broth tastes like it's actually been slowly simmering for hours, and the herbs they provide are fresh and fragrant!

Regular pho #1 is actually pretty good surprisingly. It comes with a few slices of beef (not good quality imo), beef tripe, beef balls and some tendon type of meat, but the broth and noodles are good. Broth tastes comparable to the ones in ny. Definitely a nice spot for lunch or dinner. Prices are relatively cheap ($7.50 for #1) Self serve tea yay (DO NOT GET THE BUBBLE TEA). I ordered the bubble milk tea and it was overly sweet and tasted mediocre with rock hard boba. I know they aren't known for their bubble tea and whatever but if it's this bad, don't put it on the menu.Would recommend to those in the area."}, {"review_id": "BWA5j-zhGK1j0e8CquLO8A", "user_id": "knlnq1RcqYaM_j5I6lF4pA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "This place is phenomenal...I have been trying to convince someone to go there with me forever, but they were skeptical because it's in Bridgeport.

We saw the great yelp reviews and on a cold night, this was our comfort food. After going to the Beardsley zoo, we came here for take out. It felt very Asian to me with the way the condiments and utensils were laid out on the table and the small cozy space. There weren't too many people at 5pm but the few tables that were there seemed very satisfied. Got the fresh spring rolls banh cuon (3 big shrimps in each roll, and 4 rolls in an order) ~$8 to share. The peanut sauce that came with it made the rolls soooooooooo tasty~ Hubby saved the remnants of the sauce to pour over his bun when we got home. I got for my entree the Bun Bo Hue (spicy soup with pork/beef/fish cake(?) and bean sprouts and rice noodles. SO GOOD! Since we got it to go, by the time we got home, it was only luke warm. So I heated up my soup and added in the noodle and veggies (nicely packed in a separate container so everything was fresh) and i got too spice happy and dumped the whole chili oil container in my soup and made it too hot. The chili oil was fragrant and really spicy so add slowly. The noodle was different from pho or bun in shape but I liked it. It's like a fatter version of bun noodle. The Hubs got Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio Trung (2 full spring rolls, cucumber, 2 big grilled shrimps, lots of delicious grilled pork and fried egg and vermicelli noodles with some peanut dusts on top). It was really delicious and well priced at $10.50. Wish there were more noodle b/c there was so much meat and veggie left over and not enough noodle to go with the side stuff, but great flavor and delicious side dish when my soup got too spicy (thanks to hubsy for sharing). Will definitely go back to try the other dishes but very satisfied with what we had ordered."}, {"review_id": "9ZALyNskW1bhHofuSi0iig", "user_id": "Z46hJ0h8CWqgHMp7VoyZaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Best pho in town love coming here .

If you are in the mood to satisfy your pho craving, this is the place you should go to in Fairfield County. In addition, the noodle (bun) dish, Bun Thit Nuong Cha Goi Tom Trung, is quite satisfying. It contains grilled meat and shrimp, noodles, vegetables, rolls, and a fried egg. One bowl of deliciousness.The menu offerings are limited compared to many other Vietnamese restaurants, however, they execute the pho, goi cuon, and bun dishes well. Sauces and condiments are available on the table as with most Vietnamese establishments. Pho choices are loaded with meat and the usual accompaniments are provided....culantro (saw grass), bean sprouts, Thai Basil, and Jalapeños. Often I request half the amount of noodles due to rarely finishing the normal portion provided. I generally add a few drops of fish sauce into my broth for an extra depth of flavor. Goi Cuon is freshly rolled and not prepared in advance. Therefore, the rice paper remains soft. There are 4 rolls per order and they are generous with the size and amount of fillings. Definitely an appetizer for sharing. Cha Gio could use a face lift. I find the rolls are often dry or overcooked. Furthermore, I'm use to having the appetizer with a variety of greens and herbs to roll them in. This is not how it is plated here. Minimal green leaf is provided. Bubble tea is available with bursting bubbles or jelly. I prefer the chewy tapioca bubbles so I usually order an avocado smoothie with jelly.  I am disappointed that the bahn mi is removed from the menu. Hopefully, this item will return. This use to be one of the only places to obtain this delicious sandwich in the area. Overall,  go to this place for pho, bun, and goi cuon.  You will not find a better choice in southern ct."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-hong-thom-bridgeport?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
