Came in on a Sunday afternoon so they weren't busy. The server was helpful in giving appetizer opinions but we opted out and just ordered entrees. I got the bacon Gouda burger and it was... ok. Is it crazy for me to admit that the best Gouda burger I've had this far was from United Airlines in flight menu? Anywho. Wasn't wowed by the burger, it had bacon pieces instead of full up strips of bacon and the Gouda smear was creamy but I would've preferred just normal Gouda instead of it being mixed with who knows what to make the smear. The fries were your typical frozen variety with some seasoned salt to make them not seem like your ordinary fries. Overall wasn't impressed enough to want to come back. Maybe we just ordered the wrong choices?"}, {"review_id": "jTLvtNLoeGgK8goWGyY4Rg", "user_id": "Krlkw1EBJ8wV5zPG8mSnTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Quick service, with great options to choose from!!

I came in for lunch the other day and ordered the chicken pot pie. It has a very soupy filling with peas and mushrooms.

Other gastropubs tend to add in unusual or un-pub like plates to their menu, but at Blackbird, the food is very \"comfort/pub\" oriented (think pot pie, fish and chips, meatloaf sliders, por roast, and burgers). The pot pie is actually quite good but you'll have to wait a while for it to cool down before digging in. My other 'go-to' choices at Blackbird are the pulled pork sandwich and the smoked chicken with gorgonzola pizza. The beer menu's not bad but it definetely could be a lot better. The style of the place itself is nice but I much prefer the main area, the second floor feels somewhat isolated. Overall, it's good pub food for extra dollars and probably the only place close to campus that has a slight touch of urban/upscale style."}, {"review_id": "Qpk48pfpVIR4A22gHnkXPw", "user_id": "fKXohnXgbxNEVgsAwpl9_w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/15/2017", "text": "Super disappointed in our experience.  My first trip to Oklahoma so I took to Yelp for my options.  We luckily found a parking spot which I could imagine would be hard on a super busy night. I believe the 2 restaurants next to each other merged together now to be one large place.  We were seated upstairs in an awkward set up of a room.  The server had to maneuver between chairs to refill drinks.  For a gastropub I was confused by the menu.  Very burger and pub food driven.  Not at all what I was expecting. Nothing memorable about our meal, service was also unfortunately awkward.  I ordered a vodka tonic and took one sip and realized it was club soda.  No biggie but it took forever for the problem to he corrected.  I think this restaurant needs to figure themselves out.  Really direct the energy and focus on being a gastropub and delivering a unique experience.  I unfortunately was not feeling the love."}, {"review_id": "kKDX04AUpeRANrkX-uby4A", "user_id": "5UAj092bUxjZ8MUYWFyVvg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Pretty disappointed. First, the menu on Yelp looked nothing like what they actually offered. Burgers and everything else were different. We didn't ask to have our burgers cooked a different way, but then again, we weren't asked so I would've assumed medium to medium well. Nope. All three were rare... very pink/red in the middle. My bacon/Gouda spread didn't have much taste. In general, neither did the burger. The beer mustard that came with the burgers was also strange. Just didn't seem to go. I replaced my fries with their brussel sprouts. I think this is why some don't like brussel sprouts. They were boiled and mushy. Not good at all. Disappointing all the way around."}, {"review_id": "JQlNj1bgahbI5pmUfrzgZg", "user_id": "PcgtOrx8nNChB__ccEPPDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/27/2016", "text": "Ah \"gastropubs\", code for = expensive pub food.All the food here was very comfort-oriented.  Which is fine.  I'm just living in Alaska now and I'd love to see some more veggie options!  Not even vegetarian, just some more roughage!  Crispy roughage is so rare north of the wall...That said, the tap selection was above average for the area and the dark, moody ambiance was top-notch.I'd definitely come back for a couple drinks, but I'd probably have dinner somewhere else."}, {"review_id": "G2XEW2hOFys0FPbrVX8sTA", "user_id": "nD2R62j9GiQlIdzuM1AxAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/27/2017", "text": "The pot pies are the real show stealer here!

I was one of three people sitting at the bar. The other two were obviously friends of the bartender and I got to listen to them sing and at one point, do some sort of cheer. Awesome. College students. So the service was spotty at best. I had the chicken pot pie. The menu looks like it's comfort food your mom would make, but your mom would make it better. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie after reading so many positive reviews on it. I honestly thought they brought me the Veggie Pot Pie at first. Chicken was scarce and it tasted strongly of mushrooms. I have no problem with mushrooms, but they were very large and very potent tasting that it was a bit of a shock. I think when you expect chicken and you taste mushroom, it throws you off a little. I felt they should have noted the mushrooms on the menu purely for the fact that they are so bold in the dish. Had a side of Brussels sprouts to get some vegetables in, they were just ok."}, {"review_id": "fIRikF_YW4Cg9USp24mMDA", "user_id": "CRwDgm6zXXdQuTfHG5zoBw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/17/2016", "text": "As one of the nicest place recommended in Campus Corner, I was expecting a little more.  To be fair, it was pumped up so much, I went in expecting more then what was delivered.I really liked the setup:  outside seating both in front and back of the restaurant; inside the bar is located forward and to the right; with dinner seating on a second floor and to the left.  For the size of the restaurant, they definitely have a perfect layout with great deal of intimate seating, as well as, seating for large groups.The hostess... I'm not sure if she realized she was working for a restaurant vs. a department store as she said:  \"How can I help you\"  :  I wanted to respond with:  \"a size 7 in black patent\" ...

Absolutely spot on!However, the quality of service at the restaurant left much to be desired. It was very clear that our waitress was a new waitress which is perfectly fine, if the staff supports that individual instead of trying to pick up pieces of her job leaving her unable to perform her duties on the restaurant floor. Additionally, I nearly was run over by a tall, young gentleman, who did not understand the etiquette of allowing a guest to cross an intersection before moving himself. These types of mistakes indicate a lack of leadership within the front of house staff and need to be rectified to improve the overall guest experience.Additionally, for how beautiful the front of house is in the quality of the food being presented, the restroom amenities were subpar at best. I have seen better restrooms, cleaner restrooms in Chinese buffet style restaurants, and that was very disappointing as well.It is clear that ownership has a focus on the quality of product being delivered. However, they do not recognize that the quality of the product is not just the food but the atmosphere of the entire establishment and the quality of service being provided, which on this particular occasion was unsatisfactory."}, {"review_id": "PUOonWo-9I1Zma0tSGnQfg", "user_id": "UDuoH9Hz9j_al8tniJGsSA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2017", "text": "I've been here twice and both times were great, it has good food and an atmosphere for everyone.The Good:- Atmosphere: this place is big and has a large variety of seating options from bars to lounges to patio.- Food: The food is solid and definitely a notch above standard pub fare, but the real star is their pot roast.

If you're going with a big group, the eclectic menu definitely is a plus. The food was actually tasty--my fish and chips tasted impeccable. I love the french fries and could've more if I had the opportunity! A couple other folks in my group noted that the portions were not comparable to price (i.e. too little food). I could've done with a little more food, but I was also super hungry, so, shrug. Blackbird was fairly quiet during our meal, which I chalked up to summertime around campus, but even with barely anyone else in the restaurant, the waiter treated us like an afterthought. As in a \"Oh yeah, you guys are here\" kind of attitude. The service wasn't horrible, just not terribly attentive. Maybe Blackbird is better during dinner?

Service was great and fast, very clean, and the style and decor is top notch. This place was huge, private party rooms on the second floor, large environment on the first floor, a HUGE drink menu, plenty of LED screens, and modernized. Actually, it looks more like a modernized saloon. But, where it fails to receive the maximum 5/5 stars is due to the actual taste of the food. To the eye the dishes were mouth watering. To the tongue it became slightly bland or not living up to the eye's expectations. Meatloaf was par, mac and cheese needed flavor and thickness (was too watery), and the Shepherd's pie was only fast food quality. I am not sure why it just did not hit the spot. Will be back to give it a second chance though. If anything I will be back for the large selection of drinks."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/blackbird-gastropub-norman?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
