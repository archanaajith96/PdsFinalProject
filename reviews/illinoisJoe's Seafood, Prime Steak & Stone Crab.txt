We went here for our anniversary because you know, stone crab claws and enjoyed a really great meal. Our waitress Emilie met us at our table with two complimentary glasses of champaign to help us kick off our anniversary. She gave us great recommendations, knew exactly when to check in with us but gave us space to enjoy our dinner. She was assisted by a man named Fluffy who was also awesome but we are unsure how he got that name. Anyway, we got excellent service.We ordered additional drinks. I went with an old fashioned and my husband ordered a moscow mule. Drinks came off fast and the drinks were perfectly balanced. We kicked off dinner with some Kumamoto oyster and, of course, stone crab claws. Do yourself a favor...get these claws. They are beautiful, precracked and DELICIOUS! I always laugh at myself when we come here because they have amazing seafood. They currently have a Halibut special that I was extremely tempted by BUT, I keep going back to steak. It is just so good here. I went with the Filet Oscar this particular evening and had zero regrets about it. Steak was cooked perfectly and I got to control how much how much bearnaise sauce I put on it (but let's be honest, all of the sauce ends up on the plate...so maybe that should just say the pace of the sauce). The crab and asparagus...again a delicious part of what makes filet oscar so amazing. My husband went with the strip steak and was extremely happy as well. We shared an order of fries. The fries came out piping hot and managed to get the salt to fry ratio perfect. We wrapped up this indulgence by sharing a slice of key lime pie. The meal and service we just excellent. If you are here in Chicago for a visit, make sure you make this place a part of your trip. You won't be sorry.PRO-TIP: This restaurant is part of the LEYE group.

Not sure I've ever experienced such friendly and helpful service before.Ambiance is nice and the location is great. The restaurant was busy on a Saturday afternoon so definitely make a reservation.Food is overall excellent. I recommend the King Crab Louis salad, which is delicious, even without the dressing (which I didn't eat). The baked sweet potato was also delicious, and my husband enjoyed his Mahi Mahi. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the bread basket, which was lacking in freshness and taste.Overall Joe's was great and we'll definitely return if we're in the area."}, {"review_id": "AHluPoSeTBmoTbkilq5kFw", "user_id": "6Zx7YiKFYXwqWXQBqSxoYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "This restaurant runs on precision. Everyone is very good at what they do from when you sit down and the bread comes, to how the food is delivered and dishes removed. Chris, our server, was outstanding!The food is quite good too, with all the fish and meat classics. We started with the very fresh tuna tartare and the classic shrimp jonghe. For entrees we had the sea bass and Dover sole. The sea bass was light and flaky with a light teriyaki flavor. The Dover sole was deboned at the table, as it should be, and perfectly done. It was a nice size with a side of browned butter. We had a side of the grilled tomatoes with spinach and melted cheese. It wasn't my favorite, but the others liked it. We finished with the special dessert of strawberry ice cream cake. A real treat to finish the meal. One complaint. They won't seat you until your whole party is there, so there is a crush of people by the entrance waiting. I usually get to a restaurant first and have a glass of wine waiting for my wife."}, {"review_id": "D487psdUpMg69iM3IVLiYg", "user_id": "Ns-Toil0UYy72Qj2amPpNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "Definitely one of my new favorite special occasion restaurants! Came for restaurant week and had an amazing experience. The food was amazing. I had the restaurant week option with stone crab claws that came with creamed spinach and hashed Browns and my husband had the ahi tuna filet mignon off the regular menu! Everything was delicious. We didn't try the steaks, but they looked really good at the table next to us. The service was top notch, which made the experience even better. Our server made great food suggestions, and even threw in a free slice of key lime pie for my husband since my restaurant week meal came with banana creme pie and his didn't coming off the regular menu. In his words: \"I can't let you leave without trying our key lime pie\". This is a place I would make reservations for since they seem pretty busy, but there is a really big bar area out front with the full menu. I can't wait to come back and try some of the options off the regular menu!"}, {"review_id": "UHteljkwTrUnbYWAEdTlLA", "user_id": "FiZn-x6ZSoKyeskbxpvE1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "As a Florida girl, I have to say this place is pretty good! Reservations are SO hard to come by but the bar area is really large so I feel like it wouldn't be that hard to just drop by and grab a seat there. Ambience: formal, but pretty packed, making it not very intimate. Wasn't my favorite. Prices: the seafood dishes are pretty good prices. The steaks on the other hand are pricey (not any more so than the other fancy steam places in the city). The people next to us got steaks and they looked really good (and they seemed to enjoy them) but it still just doesn't seem worth it. The desserts seem reasonably priced given the portions. Drinks: YUM! Granted, they are also pricey, but I have the sangria and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Almost all the people around me got one. Food: I'd say 4/5. I got the grilled seafood platter (shrimp, scallops, lobster). The shrimp were a bit over cooked and the lobster were a bit undercooked. The scallops were just right! The Mac and cheese side was super tasty but the seasonal cauliflower side was bland. My husband got a seafood pasta dish and he said it was good but he regretted not getting what I got. The waiter gave us a free half slice of meh lime pie and it was ALMOST as good as the key lime pies homemade in South Florida. Serious nostalgia. Service: excellent! Our waiter was super accommodating and he gave us free dessert. He let me taste the sangria before I ordered it which was also awesome!"}, {"review_id": "HiUyZBQ8mOlN9_JsCd69Pg", "user_id": "jKEOeE2Qu6W4JGHG9Oy55Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "First time trying stone crab and I am hooked. There is really nothing like it and the claws here have so much meat. At the advice of the waiter, we got the Select size (6) claws to share between 2 people, which was perfect. Would come back just for these guys alone. The 30oz porterhouse was also great for sharing; the tenderloin was amazing. Nice ambiance inside. It's hard to get a table at times but the bar/hightop seating is free for all. We came on a holiday at dinner time and there were plenty of open tables - we'll probably do that next time rather than wait for a reservation."}, {"review_id": "qLu-xiIFXhpBsFaDYi9jJQ", "user_id": "ncvgNeEsAIAuMWYFN2blhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "This place is operated by the Lettuce Eats group, which operates more than 100 restaurants mostly in Chicago and some other major cities. I have been a Lettuce Eats member for the past year, where I can earn dollar credits for future application to my visits.I was lucky to get a 7:30 dinner reservation for two here on a Monday, which I reserved on Friday. I was here for the first time in early February 2018 when it was snowing with about 1 inch of snow on the sidewalks already. I walked from my Warwick Allerton hotel. It was treacherous.When I arrived the place was packed with patrons. I arrived a bit early. I felt lucky to be here in this cold snowy evening. I checked our coats. They were not ready to seat the 7:30 reservations. I enjoyed my $14 El Diablo special cocktail at the bar high top. See my special cocktail menu pic for further info. Isabel was effective to serve my one round of cocktails. Promptly at 7:30 they started the 7:30 seating. I was impressed that this place is well run like clockwork. I was one of the first couples to be seated. All servers are dressed in formal attire. I enjoyed my seafood pasta, which was quite filling with my prosecco. See my pics. Chas was also very knowledgeable and accommodating to our table needs. Every year I receive a $15 birthday credit. I had received two birthday credits of $30, which I applied to my bill. My total bill was $152 less my $30 birthday credits so my final bill was $122 less gratuities. I also received triple points due to the triple point promotion. With my triple point award I was able to receive $30 additional reward dollars. I will definitely return here and other Lettuce Eats restaurants. More to come, when I have some more free time.  I would definitely rate Joes as one of my top ten restaurants in Chicago.

This was the perfect atmosphere with terrific food and exceptional service from all members of the wait staff. This is definitely a nice place and most of the people here were dressed relatively well, but there were others, including our group, that were dressed more casually. Whatever the case, we were treated the same and everyone that came over to our table were extremely friendly and made us feel comfortable the entire time. The food was equally as great as service. In terms of my meal, the chopped salad was delicious!! Perfectly dressed and very fresh. My Steak was cooked medium rare and the side of broccoli was crispy and delicious! Ultimately, I would highly suggest this place for a celebratory occasion, date night or casual dinner.

We started with the stuffed mushrooms, which were just a little too salty this time around though we ate them anyway!I had the petite filet and mama had the NY strip; they were both very good. We also shared jennies potatoes, which again, were good. We somehow made room to share the apple pie. It was a generous portion of pie but only a small scoop of ice cream...that's a surprising thing to scrimp on. But those are minor complaints.

It was warm and comfortable inside, with dark wood beams. Ive never made a reservation to eat here, but I have had to change plans because they were too busy. So reservations are a good idea.

I have also been to the original Joe's in Miami South Beach, but apparently the chain of locations outside the original location is different ownership. Frankly, I like the chain better. I've been to the Las Vegas location in Caesars Palace many times, and always love it. 5 Stars. Last night was my second trip to the Chicago location. It is just a good. Despite downtown Chicago being very quiet last night (10/31/17), Joe's was relatively busy, but not packed. I was by myself so had hoped to just get a spot at the bar, but every seat at the small bar was taken. There are seats at a counter along the exterior windows so I grabbed a seat there as there were several available. Service was prompt. I ordered the Select size claws which is 6 claws in the pound. $49.99. If you are not familiar with stone crab, this price is fair. Same you would get at the original location in Miami. I have found a place here and there that does them for less like in Tampa, but it is few and far between you will find them for much less than $50 for a pound of decent sized claws. As always they were cracked well, easy to eat, and with their awesome Joe's mustard sauce. If you like shellfish and have never had stone crab, you need to try them, and get them at Joe's to make sure you get an authentic experience. Also, make sure you get them between October 15th and May 15th. Outside of those dates the stone crab season is closed so you would be getting claws that had been frozen. Once frozen the meat gets stringy and very hard to pick clean off the claws. When fresh it is an amazing delicacy!"}, {"review_id": "bplJ2YlRpTjMKfjm2Ogs-g", "user_id": "JNwbtElYIEGm7IGRjoCr1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Amazing dinner!

They take quality to another level here. This place is no different. We all had seafood and the quality of each cut was amazing! The only tough part was portions. My friends ordered the snow crab (good but not my favorite), the sea bass (tiny, tiny portion), the ahi poke (excellent quality) and I got the fish and chips. The cod was good, the fries were unique with this malt seasoning. But overall, I've had better, esp in Chicago. Also, we finished off with the key lime pie and apple pie.... both good but again, you can find better desserts in Chicago. This gets a 3.5 stars from me.
