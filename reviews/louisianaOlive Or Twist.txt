I think you have to really want to go here to enjoy being here. When myself and a friend of mine went we sat at first in the separate dining area, or what appeared to be the separate dining area. We were not served or greeted even while we sat over there. So we decided to move closer to the bar where most of the activity was. At least that's where all the employees and barflies were mingling with one of the other.So we sat at one of the very small tables you know, with a little couch, anyway we immediately got service that was average at best. The food was average as well. If you like Cheers, the TV show, then this might be your place to go. We were just hungry and out looking for a new dining experience. Unfortunately this was not a good choice."}, {"review_id": "Lmb2coZjKUpz9mABIy228A", "user_id": "uDMVdKN96iTB9RlMHx2Isw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "I had heard AMAZING THINGS about the mimosa cocktails at Olive or Twist. I had also heard that the food was \"meh.\" My fiancé and I went here after getting massages as Vida Pura. Our masseuse even told us \"try the mimosa cocktails!\" Yet for our experience, the food DEFINITELY was better than the cocktails. I love a good mimosa and a good margarita, so I went for the Mimosa Rita while Zach had the London Springs. The London Springs tasted like it had artificial cucumber flavoring in it, and my Mimosa Rita tasted like a shot for every sip. For brunch I had the grillades and grits and Zach had the chicken and waffles. There were no leftovers. It was amazing.  In conclusion, I'll definitely come back here for the food, and not the mimosa cocktails."}, {"review_id": "iWebx1CVkAk_HoO_eCck_g", "user_id": "tcELdUUtd6e-OwI9k5_Ocw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "We visited on the night of the National Championship so it was pretty busy. There were plenty of tvs to watch the game on, but it was pretty loud in there. We were seated near the entrance, but it took a while for our waitress to come and take our orders. My friend has a gluten allergy so she had a difficult time finding something to eat, especially since gluten-free and vegan options were not clearly marked on the menu. Therefore, we had to keep flagging down the waitress so she could ask the kitchen if a menu item could be made gluten-free. Our cocktails were pretty good. I ordered the Dirty Bee's Knees which was light and refreshing. As an appetizer we ordered the spinach dip and asked to substitute in gluten-free chips. We also ordered the shrimp and grits cakes. When the appetizers finally arrived the kitchen forgot to substitute the gluten-free chips and so we had to try and find our waitress again to have her get us a new dish. The shrimp and grit cake were delicious and the spinach dip was pretty good.For our meal, we ordered the capreasy salad and the buffalo chicken and waffles. Neither meal was particularly impressive, especially when considering the price.Overall, I was a little disappointed after hearing such good things about this restaurant. Our waitress was missing in action most of the time and it was difficult to find gluten-free times on the menu. On top of that the food was pretty basic and due to the long wait didn't even come out hot. However, the cocktails were great! I'm willing to give Olive Or Twist another chance since many of my friends have had so good experiences so hopefully my bad one was just a fluke."}, {"review_id": "3CGvxIsFqyo3hXJKGBS43g", "user_id": "WplMar5SGC8dMaM1khOTCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "This is a great little spot. They've recently completed an expansion so you get the feel of both a bar and a restaurant. On Tuesdays they have a $5 burger night. The burger comes with hand cut fries as well. To add bacon or cheese, it's a $1 extra. The burger is fresh ground meat and pretty tasty...but even better for $5! The main menu also looks pretty tasty with daily specials throughout the week. Also, there's a HUGE selection of spirits to make just about any drink you can think of. For $10 you can play Bar Roulette. Basically you pick a few prompts and the bartender surprises you. I didn't play this time, but would love to next time! Overall, I can see this spot being great for both dates and girls nights.

I've had very good times here, however the other night was an exception and when I thought about it, my visit before this one wasn't typical either. Mainly, this has to do with service. We walked in the other night and were going to sit in the dining area. No one greeted us so we did that embarrassing linger at the host stand thing until someone finally came over and told us that in two minutes, table service would cease and we'd be limited to the late night menu. Uh, OK. Seemed like we had just made it with 2 minutes to spare, but it was clear that this was not an option. I recalled that last year, something similar happened, with a dining room full of tables covered in dirty dishes and no staff/no patrons. It was just weird.What made this visit especially disagreeable was, unfortunately, both the food (one item on the late night menu that could be veganized) and bubbly (now limited to a sweet \"Champagne\" and a less sweet, passable Prosecco). So, I got the red bean hummus sans meat and was told the Champagne was drier than the Prosecco but with one sip, I almost spit it out. What swanky cocktail bar serves lousy bubbly? I could have sworn they used to have a sparkling rose, but I could be wrong. And the red bean hummus was so overloaded with garlic, I found it inedible and barely touched it, except for what my boyfriend ate (he loves garlic, so if you do, maybe you'll like it). The other thing I've noticed is the change in clientele. The place was filled with college students. Baton Rouge is a college town, however I always found Olive or Twist to have a diverse clientele, unlike several other bars I've been to in town. Normally, I find myself not wanting to leave this place, but we were in and out in about a half hour. I miss the old intimate space and attentive service. I hate to say it, but I doubt I'll be back. This is NOT to deter potential customers, however! I am super picky about lounges and only love a small handful of those that I visit."}, {"review_id": "oz-WAZvSGqiBr2vCWM95oQ", "user_id": "6lfFEeeF8snEs64e-oodQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I've only been here for happy hour and this place lives up to its name. They employ only mixologists in the bar or at least it seems that way. The staff are always friendly and service might take a while, but that's because they take their time making each drink to perfection. If you aren't sure which of their hand crafted cocktails to order, just tell them what you like and they will either suggest something from their menu or make something new for you. From the food menu, again only having been there for happy hour, their warm baked goat cheese is my favorite!! Their bacon brussel sprouts and house fries don't disappoint. This place has limited seating so arrive early if you'd rather sit than stand by the bar."}, {"review_id": "2lgwOeTI4T7W83E6jQjQ8w", "user_id": "WaQs6MSljM0N7pGLpeMIYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Arguably the best happy hour in Baton Rouge of you need a good cocktail! $5 craft cocktails just can't be beat!

We did find some great offerings though. The place was clean and bright with outdoor seating available, however it was cold so we opted for indoors. The host, who was also or waiter, was friendly and attentive. He did get busy with the lunch crowd and was the only one seating, waiting and bussing tables so we had to flag him down a few times for refills. My roasted veggies quesadilla was wonderful served with a great onion aioli, slightly crisp and not greasy at all. My husband got the boudin and something poboy and was also impressed. The only thing that was annoying was the music, classic rock, which was way too loud for communication, especially for a lunch crowd who may want to chat about business."}, {"review_id": "CSd4emilw00n8_tkCVI2GA", "user_id": "8yDKD0PJ5GFlXONNSzNp0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "It's restaurant week in BR!

It was astounding to be ignored with no eye contact at all for over an hour while man bun complained and watched his phone and TV with zero work in an hour plus, while the rest chatted and milled about until you could catch them for any service at all. Seems there must have been an ownership or mgt change as the intimacy and bartender interaction is gone. Also, listening while one of them complains about other customers the whole time you are there is not enjoyable.My bourbon flight was just thrown down in front of me with no explanation or commentary at all. Wife enjoyed her Bleeding Heart cocktail. (Not sure that was the name)I will say the two food items we ordered were very good.....brined fried chicken breast with brussel sprouts and bacon and a Cobb Salad.Again, after we finished eating, shoved our plates sideways and had no drinks we sat for over 15 minutes trying to see if we could order dessert cocktails but it was not to be so we checked out.Thank goodness the Astros game was on one TV. We will certainly return and hope this is a minor hiccup. If not then we will not be regulars anymore.Food 4Drinks 4Service 1Averages to a 3.

Olive or Twist's selection of their menu was disappointing and did not meet my exceptions at all. In the past, I had lunch there and was thoroughly impressed so I had to come for restaurant week! The appetizer we ordered was a vile concoction of what seemed like leftover gumbo poured on a side of fries. Moreover, on to the entree, the Grits + Grillades was very unappealing.Brittany, our server was not attentive at all. She not refill our drinks, the only time she attended to our table was at her convenience on her way to serve the table outside. I saw her a total of three times. The first time to take our order, the second time on her way to her bigger table outside & the last time to drop off the bill. At the very least, Nikki offered her condolences on our unpleasant experience-- to accommodate us, she offered free drinks or to come give them a chance at 25% off our entire bill which I very much appreciated and made me want to give it another visit."}, {"review_id": "MeLabZOlfmEHdrbC2d0-6w", "user_id": "zfwfYLdxwVZfR3cCflUIdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/6/2017", "text": "Pros: Banana Foster French toast and the chicken and waffles are crazy good.
