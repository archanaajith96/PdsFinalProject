All I wanted was the paczki and it might have been one of the best desserts I've ever eaten.  There is a sugary crispness on the outer shell and chocolate chip cannoli filling inside, and they don't skimp on the amount of filling but it isn't too much.The employees are beyond friendly and helpful.  Telling us to be careful during our first bad weather day of the winter season and letting us try one or two items.  Really awesome place."}, {"review_id": "kup3e5raQ5xYZi36-dbHJw", "user_id": "ChVzzjR8Q_hOwHXbLjGZ6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "My coworker brings pastries from this place into work every once in a while. everytime I try something different it's better then the last thing I tried.  I wasn't a huge fan of cannolis before I had some from Tringali's and now I can eat an entire box of them.  I have yet to visit their store front on my own, but look to bring my husband there soon."}, {"review_id": "Aza2GWUQkKgIx0rAs4Lo0A", "user_id": "BuVltJ-G9sPWVnEgolSHLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2016", "text": "I almost don't want to write about how good they are in fear that they will run out of their amazing canolis when I want to go. I haven't gotten anything from Tringali that I didn't love. My go to's are the chocolate dipped canolis and a sfogliateli (no idea how to spell it, it's flaky, sweet, and filled with canoli cream). But everything else I've tried has also been amazing. They have every pastry and cookie you could think of as well as fresh bread and a small grocery store. I go out of my way to stop by. It's a great way to surprise family with a sweet treat as well! I believe they have been in business for quite sometime, and if they keep doing what they're doing they are going to stay in business for a long time! If you're in the area, need treats for the office, a cassata cake, sweets to get yourself out of the doghouse, anything at all, they are amazing. Would definitely recommed stopping in for your sweet tooth - they'll even leave a cannoli out of the box for you so you don't have to go home with an opened box and missing treats!!"}, {"review_id": "Yg138szXSI70_MOWqWYC6Q", "user_id": "AS9NMD2tzo5dtF_z3p1dbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/11/2017", "text": "The best baked goods around!!

I mean the lady said good morning but that was about all. She didn't even look like she liked her job at all or wanted to be there, which is sad because who wouldn't want to work around that amazing food? But oh well. Reason 2 - they had frozen cheese cake and not fresh? I've never been to a bakery that didn't have fresh cheese cake and only frozen. Big disappoint to me. But over all the pizza bread was fresh and and rolls were a day off but half off and still fresh in my book. The cannoli was pretty good, not the best I've had but I am from New York and from an Italian family who made food like this all the time for the holidays.

They are real ones too, not like those gross ones from Walmart or Kroger. It's hard not to stop in daily. Lol! They also have fresh baked bread. It's good but plan on eating it right away.
