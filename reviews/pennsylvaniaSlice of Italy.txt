This has honestly made me love this place even more. Thank you, Slice of Italy! *ORIGINAL REVIEW:My family and I order from here all the time! We are fortunate enough to live close by but I don't know what we will do if we move farther away and they can't deliver! It's one of our favorite go-to places.We have tried most of their food and have not been disappointed but their standouts for me are their garlic knots (make sure to pay extra for the cheese and the sauce, IT'S WORTH IT!), stuffed pizza (it's like a stromboli/pizza all in one!), and their cheesesteaks (go big or go home - the 16 inch is where it's at!)I have nothing bad to say about this place. The only reason for the four-star instead of five is that they do sometimes make mistakes if you have modifications on your online orders. But overall, it doesn't beat the quality of the food. I definitely recommend this establishment!"}, {"review_id": "2mecO1uhmaTefR3Qor_VUg", "user_id": "XVWRQvQiVu3RvWsIAzv8Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Small little pizza place but great quality food!

Everything was fantastic, and the server was smiling and friendly. Portions were huge... I could only eat half of my spaghetti parm. I definitely recommend!"}, {"review_id": "JxW-Q0UXclzPGO-Lag1-UQ", "user_id": "JuNbPA6TKsYuCVCQzTcBOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Traveling through the state and looked on yelp for a good Italian place - the voters are right!!!

Great staff; super friendly and attentive cute and not kitschy decor. We both had the small garden salad- super yummy; all fresh: mixed greens, olives, red onions, croutons, carrots and a touch of cheeseMy mistake when I ordered the marguerite pizza. I expected sauce with tomatoes. It was basically a white pizza with tomato slices and s touch of basil. Good, but not what I expected. The dough however is great!  I'll order a cheese slice next time Definitely will give it another go next time we're back in town"}, {"review_id": "1ysbf2MNzbEPvCZE_W_ykw", "user_id": "byBujnjO-aT5IaGQk9SBgg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "Don't order the white pizza unless you want to fill your arteries with cheese. The pizza literally weighed like 4-5 pounds. We didn't read their list of ingredients, but white pizzas aren't supposed to have motz and 4 other cheeses. It's supposed to be just ricotta. After ordering my pizza my husband went in and they pulled it out, he said it's ok if it goes in longer we ordered it well done. Slice of Italy said, oh you ordered it well done? He repeated those instructions on the phone. The pizza was still rubbery not at all well done, what if he took it out when he originally wanted to?  He also said the Caesar dressing would be on the side. I had to throw out half of my salad, since they only sell large and it was coated in dressing. Don't waste your time purchasing garlic knots they are smaller than donut holes. I really like their grandmas pizza, which is why We went there over Potties across the street. Should have went with my usual."}, {"review_id": "fYw7LebCYCmROADqgihl_A", "user_id": "mJ_Kll4xbyEtDK5dId-3eg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Crust was thick, doughy, and soggy.

I do wish the sauce had a little more tomato richness flavor rather than dried out oldness.Fries were ok.The hoagie may have been better with less bread and more meat, but the ingredients were good and fresh.Not the best place for eating in. It's small and sitting next to the door made me feel like I was eating pizza while sitting in a pile of snow.I appreciated the pizza shop music playing low in the background. A lot of people were crammed in there both to eat and pick up food.I'd go there again if I was in the area and in the mood for Italian but wouldn't go out of my way for it."}, {"review_id": "5YuA5AbNtS1ulf47fudZug", "user_id": "MzpAFJgwP-Pt_rz-S8eCeQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Extremely disappointed. I ordered a chicken sub from here and it does NOT say on the menu that there is mayo on it. I've never seen more mayo on a sandwich in my life. The bread was soaking wet all the way through and falling apart because of how much mayo was on it. I cannot eat mayo and the restaurant closed before I could bring it back. Very upsetting. Horrible. How can you put something on a sandwich that you didn't say was on It on your menu????

In Allentown for the weekend and came across this jewel of an eatery. Called ahead to see if they had a 2 top available and the cheerful voice on the other end said, \"absolutely. \"That friendly voice turned out to be Cat,  who was also our server. I kid you not, Cat was handling the dining room as well as assisting with take out orders and never once did she falter. Efficient, attentive, and friendly you could not ask for anything more. Great service with nothing but a good attitude!Now, onto the food. Being first timers we tried several items from the ample menu. We each had a slice of pizza, one sausage and one pepperoni. No sausage crumbles here,  nothing but the real deal Italian sausage, sliced thin. Excellent sauce, perfect crust, and Buffalo Mozzarella made for an excellent appetizer. Likewise the pepperoni was equally delicious.Whatever you do, do not pass up the garlic knots. We had ours with sauce and cheese and they were amazing. More of that great bread,  redolent with garlic combined with the red sauce, and cheese, so good you'll want to smack your Momma.Our entrées were just as amazing. Linguini  with red clam sauce and eggplant parmesean. The eggplant was thinly sliced and fried just right. Nice and crisp, covered with sauce  and cheese. Glorious.The Linguini was freshly made, served with plenty of fresh clams, that amazing garlic infused red sauce. Neptune never had better.Located in a strip shopping center the place was clean and well managed by the owner George who seemed to know everyone by name.If you're ever in the area this is a must do if you want great italian."}, {"review_id": "_GX8ilvP6CeMho_lGz_LAQ", "user_id": "TrY3mL00SK9Rop7mWCZzhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "My favorite place for Italian food.

Once checked in at our hotel I starting Yelping. I called a franchise restaurant to find out their wait time was 1.5 hours to 2 for a 4 top. When I called Slice of Italy I was warmly greeted on the phone by who would become our waitress,  with - we have a table now,  would you like us to reserve it for you?  Sure I said and thus began a wonderful dining experience.  Upon arrival we found our table (1 of about only 10) was clean and our name on it. The staff just couldn't have been better the entire evening.  Small Venue but huge on customer service.  I believe I heard Italian being spoke behind the counter but not positive for what that is worth. The tables are directly next to the open kitchen so we watched our pizza being made. The man who I assume was the owner inspected it three times in the oven turning it each time.  It came to us a perfectly cooked crust.  Thin slice crust, gargantuan, traditional Italian sauce (unsweet) and excellent flavored cheese for 12.99. I had a pasta made from the top right corner of the menu where you can \"build your own\".  Vodka sauce and penne was my choice as it had onions, ham and peas in it. I asked for extra garlic hoping not to offend.  Bingo!  A home cooked masterpiece arrived. My son had a small calzone that came out on a round pizza pan.  It filled half of the large sized pizza pan.  Again, perfect crust, massive and excellent flavors. Forgot to mention eggplant fries for appetizer were definitely different.  Don't order them unless you like eggplant because that is exactly what the taste was.  No beer either,  I asked to see their list and was told that they are a BYOB restaurant. I did not try that out and ordered a coke.  Imagine the same for wine but I did not ask so unsure.  We had quite a bit left over when the owner stopped by and asked how everything was? Great we said and he asked if we wanted to box everything up to take with us. Sure we replied and said that we had a small fridge back in our room.  No problem he replied and came back with hotel sized boxes for us that fit perfectly in those small fridges. We paid and left a 25% tip.  My wife was in the car while I waited inside for my oldest to  come along and the owner walks up to me and says, \" I heard your wife talking about wanting a pretzel from the place next door which was closed.  Do you think she would want one?  Of course I said yes but wondering how.  He said they give him some leftovers when they close so he walks a bag of warm pretzels out to our car and gives them to my wife!  Phenomenal!  I am 52 years old from northern Va. and travel frequently up and down the east coast in search of these hidden gems.  New York City is a must for us and I say Slice of Italy ranks up there in freshness of food and taste.  We all have our ideas of the best pizza so I won't argue with anybody on that but this place is in my top ten.  Service is beyond good so what's not to like?  The owners knew most everybody who stopped in here and he treated us the same or better.  I will DEFINITELY stop back here next time in Allentown and hopefully get in early enough to visit an open pretzel store as well.
