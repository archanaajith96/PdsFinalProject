It is a great place for breakfast/brunch/lunch (any day of the week), a sweet treat, or a boozy cocktail. Alison and her team hand craft amazing coffee drinks, cocktails and food. Weekdays are great for meeting friends or colleagues for coffee and a nosh (no bakes and boozie brownies are my favorites), or breakfast fast or lunch. Weekends can be a little busier, but worth the wait for a pumpkin waffle (or the recently introduced French toast). Want a Bloody Mary or mimosa with that waffle?! They have a full bar and will craft a cocktail to your liking. With an always rotating selection of whisky, Boots is also a great stop for an evening (afternoon?) Old Fashion. Alison sources produce from local farms like Urban Eden Farms (which has an amazing CSA, btw), coffee from local roasters like Evans Brothers and Doma. This is a local gem of a gathering place. Whether you are vegan, vegetarian or an omnivore, you will find something to love at Boots Bakery!"}, {"review_id": "WAttdo35SHTwHRqIrqpyKw", "user_id": "1u4aRn3W7P8EHpha5cICRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I was really surprised to find a vegan restaurant in Spokane. They make the food in bulk and have it in a chilled case. We split the breakfast scramble and the curried veg dish. I was a little upset to see the they heat the food up in a microwave. I feel the could do a little better. Non the less the food was pretty good. I preferred the curry vegetables over the scramble which had a strong nutritional yeast taste.  We did not try the waffles which I have heard are amazing. Next time!"}, {"review_id": "cfAUB_2EbTDP4r0xexLZfw", "user_id": "MJHYxIzp70VLWdwcOWTo9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Envision a victorious vegan menu.Inviting invigorating visions of sated hunger pains just for you. Their passion for food is stronger than most, but get a cup of black coffee and taste the perfect roast. Their mug selection plentiful,Their vegan cupcakes incredible. Their waffles desirable and their seating fashionable. I have no qualms, except maybe one or two. Some things a cackle of moms, I'm sure would complain about too. First is the mural of two lovers on the wall. An artistic depiction of friends having a ball. Great artwork, good shading, that's not the complaint. But I'd rather not have my coffee and a show of no restraint in paint. The second is last and there is nothing you could do. I'd rather not pay for parking to participate in perfectly good portabellas."}, {"review_id": "pH-Cg1sOzJcbRfB4BIcsYg", "user_id": "taQ3SZLNPAGYs_uVPtm-iw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "So I don't have exact dietary restrictions. There isn't any need for me to be gluten free or vegan, and I'm not but I enjoy all types of food. I love holistic wellness, and things that are good for your body and places like Boots supplement that for me. My most favorite thing ever is the vegan cupcakes. They are just delicious and I had not a single idea that they would be so so so good. The buttery (but not butter) goodness is unreal and will change your life."}, {"review_id": "0vv6wGgqG29zfIDBP5nSXA", "user_id": "Sg_BvnTHsbc1AABiJjaiPA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Tasty vegan dishes, served deli style. Order from the options in the display case (plus pumpkin waffles and soup of the day) and they'll literally microwave whatever you want heated, so you have your meal in minutes. I chose a trio of salads/sides. I feel the coconut curry chickpeas were surprisingly bland, while the kale salad was super strong. Filling and overall tasty though, and felt like a healthy lunch to fuel our day. There was a special beverage (switchel) with apple cider vinegar and ginger etc. that seems like it'll cure any illness. Spicy, tart, and cozy at the same time."}, {"review_id": "rGMn_JMhiKScTmSlg_v-Fg", "user_id": "zgiWETKckSxZgisDI71tng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "Vegan gal here. This place is wonderful. Vibe is casual and warm. Great coffee and cupcakes. You can ask to buy the day old cupcakes for half off. Ordered the breakfast faux sausage fritata and it was savory and flavorful. Owner is very kind and checks in on customers. A greAt place to bring visitors and brunch. For my daughters birthday we ordered cupcakes with no frosting. Our idea was to save a little money and give the kids a fun activity : decorate your own cupcakes. Boots was very understanding and the cupcakes were delectable. They were nice enough to give us a complimentary tray of frosting on the side too!"}, {"review_id": "eFTmNTRx9zJocQ4zmPQ_8Q", "user_id": "6X1R--1z7GENvQZPTitXPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Really cute place for both savory and sweet treats! They have a lot of vegan and GF options. First time there, I tried the pumpkin spice waffles with chai butter and maple syrup. The other times, I had their fruit bar and strawberry cheesecake cupcake, which were also both pretty delicious. Service was quick, but there can be wait during peak times. The workers are friendly. The only downside was parking availability. Since this is located downtown, most will be street parking. I would definitely come back again!"}, {"review_id": "epzlie2lR3Z_oKqkjleiNw", "user_id": "1kZIf0vqVqRDJ3-1GIumVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/9/2017", "text": "100% vegan bakery, deli, bar, coffee house.  We ordered 2 salads for breakfast and 8 baked goods for snacking on the road.  Everything was 4-5 stars.  It's a shame they are 6 hours away from us.Recommendation to the business owner:  change one of your 3 Yelp categories to \"Vegan\".  We almost skipped right over your listing."}, {"review_id": "xe5JBGI6f-Ae52p3O5HYCw", "user_id": "Bi0Pu2mBFdklTngJ7Yz99Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Delicious americano.

My pumpkin waffle was pretty good but nothing too special, the butter was interesting. Weirdly enough it was actually borderline too spicy.

I was looking for dessert after dinner, and typically find a good local cafe to enjoy a mocha.  This place had good reviews, and seemed like just the thing, especially since they advertise a bakery! They had just two chocolate baked goods (surprisingly), but there was a mini bundt cake that looked just perfect!  Looks are deceiving as it tasted like a dried sponge mixed with some cake mix. I also ordered a medium mocha, and while it tasted pretty good, it would have been really great had it actually been hot.  Instead, it was cooler than hot tap water.  Seemed really strange on a cold rainy night. In short, I would try this place again only if a friend vouched for it.  Perhaps this was just an off night, but I doubt it.  After reading some of the other reviews in detail, it seems that even though people have issues or complaints with this place, they still give it 4 & 5 stars.  $9+ for lukewarm coffee and bad baking just doesn't make sense to me."}, {"review_id": "iJZbQotZpcvJk25--Pf2Hg", "user_id": "n6A3enNYzQsFBXuVcfozPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "i can't eat the dairy or gluten and i found this amazing bakery in spokane of all places! i ate a delicious lemon cake nobody would ever guess it was gluten free and vegan! i'm super impressed with the quality of food and thankful for options! most of the items i saw were gluten free. i love this place i want to drive back to spokane just to come here. thank you!!!!!!!"}, {"review_id": "wUX5ifqCJUfq4HYwnnz3eA", "user_id": "_VMN6t3E5X6N6NTPVtKIBA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "So, this place is very trendy.

I have food allergies, and sometimes struggle to find places I can eat, especially if I'm looking for pastries. Their cased items list gf, vegan, soy free, etc. so you can see for yourself if it's something you'd like to order based on ingredients if you're into that. I happily chose a ginger cookie which is my favorite thing I had from there. SO GOOD! We came back a few days later and I grabbed a pumpkin waffle to-go that was delicious and satisfying. We tried a few things that were all great, but the poppyseed bread is a tad bit too sweet with the icing on top. I'll also add that the service was friendly and as prompt as possible with two people working. The customers seemed to know one another and enjoy chatting. I'll definitely be back on the next visit."}, {"review_id": "VZBdpAc8QcihZ6OQ6U7JDQ", "user_id": "nDFb4_tu8bCbx0PVcunelQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "As a lover of delicious gluten free food, I seriously appreciate the baked goods at Boots.
