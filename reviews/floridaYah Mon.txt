I'll admit that the service was incredible and my waiter was amazing. The food on the other hand was not up to my expectations and it took forever for them to make it.  My roti was horrible and I'm ashamed that they even served it to me. The jerk chicken had good seasoning on it but it was dry. The ox tails were good though. Don't order the Sorrel! I don't mind paying 12.99 for legit Sorrel but this stuff wasn't up to park."}, {"review_id": "DO605ScKJe0dU-EoSsi1kA", "user_id": "8qTQdWYoEpyWegIWDk5MlQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "I guess, I'll be one of the few bad reviews - but I was so disappointed. I've visited this restaurant before and it was amazing. This visit reservations were made well in advance for Valentines night. The first few minutes was similar to our first visit, drinks/placing our orders - after which we never saw, who we thought was our server, again. We then waited nearly an hour for entrees. Watching guests who came in well after us (and who obviously appeared to be friends with management) be served and nearly complete their meals. We only received attention after flagging down another member of the waitstaff. During our wait we were never asked if we'd like additional beverages or even an explanation. Once it was clear we were annoyed, food was quickly scramble together and brought to us and excused given by management. However, at that point, dinner was a bust and we just wanted to get out to enjoy what was left of the evening. Needless to say it was a crappy Valentines night meal."}, {"review_id": "tOuBw3IQjsg3EwhBTfriLA", "user_id": "muvuCp-PjnyyBAJZNFG2lg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Another delicious Caribbean food dining at YahMon.  19 residents of Bayshore enjoyed the night with a Beautiful ambience well decorated Feb Valentine Theme colors of red and white.  The food was so delicious and everyone ate all their food and the Virgin fruit drinks are very refreshing to the last sip.  I picked this place for our residents monthly valentine celebration event and it was a night to remember.  Family owned restaurant that shows a lot of personal touch inside this restaurant.  Located across the pharmacy window pick up of Walgreens.   Entrance is either by UPS or WALLGREENS just in case you can't see the small left side entrance before the Selmon Freeway bridge."}, {"review_id": "PlF_9jb-bGUvNQiSmBRctQ", "user_id": "IOX4m9-sWTcjaqDy3r_O8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Delicious! Very tasty Caribbean food. The ox meat is ridiculously tender, juicy, and delicious. They close a little early, so don't plan to go if after 7 or else you'll feel rushed. The staff is really nice and courteous. Tables have white table clothes and it's beautifully decorated. Only beer and wine is sold. However they do have liquor flavored wine. Weird but delicious! They sell tequila, vodka, and rum flavored wine shots. Never had those before but they are great! It's in the back of the Walgreens on Platt. If their location was closer to SoHo, this place would be packed every night!"}, {"review_id": "NGlf7yeC0HpF8S7AtFcB2A", "user_id": "nXoMel2fnA_dbgtZgpS0Uw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "Wrote a review for this place a while ago but don't know what happened to it. This is my hubby's favorite place to dine for Caribbean food. He is completely hooked. The food is amazing and so are the couple that run the place. You will always find the wife in the kitchen and the husband on the floor working hard. They always remember diners and go out of their way to serve you. The place is kind of in a challenging location but it is worth the hassle.The inside is dimly lit and romantic. You'll hear soft Caribbean music playing in the background; a nice compliment to the meal. I have tried most of the items on the menu except the dessert items. That's so weird for me right? Anyway, after my month long sugar cleanse I will make it my priority to sample some desserts on my next visit, I may even have dessert before dinner hehe."}, {"review_id": "l6UmS8-iXrIAEpaBSXL8bA", "user_id": "2corY4tdT_E4QXGTpzv7zw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "This has to be my favorite  restaurant by far 5 out of 5.

They had the tables decorated our severs were andre and Shawn and I must say they were wonderful.  I had the Caribbean platter which came with brown stew chicken, curry chicken, jerk chicken, with rice and beans and salad. The presentation was great. We also had the brown stew fish which was amazing. They played happy birthday and brought out a delicious bread puddling warmed with rum and raisin ice cream it was magnificent.

They graciously accommodated our party even tho it was nearing closing. The decor is very nice, more than I expected. Ceiling to floor white curtains decorate the windows, white table cloths, servers appropriately dressed. Gives the restaurant a fancy but not stuffy air. We ordered several different items. We heard about their wings, so we ordered jerk and bbq. We also ordered cheese bread, chicken curry and rice and beans. Everything was great. The wings were spicy but fall off the bone tender. Cheese bread was (go figure) tasty. And the chicken curry was delicious. Not a too strong spice, but tender and the meat was plentiful. The rice that accompanied it was good, maybe lacked salt. Service was also 5 star. They seemed to have a team effort, and it was noticed. Definitely glad we tried Yah Mon!"}, {"review_id": "FLAaD3yMTYMhsNBbuzGhAQ", "user_id": "1TSNnpcp-BFxlSe0gRCCUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "First Impressions...So you're having flashbacks of the beautiful island and the wonderful food?  Wat gwan?! You want the taste of the island without incurring the cost of an all inclusive resort well Yah Mon is your place.  Seriously, everyting is irie!  Andre a.k.a, front of the house a.k.a, owner a.k.a, your waiter, a.k.a--jack of all trades makes you feel right at home. He's personable, attentive and I would say \"easy on the eyes ladies\" but he's married to the person who's preparing your meals so sorry ladies \"Get your life elsewhere\"!  Anyway.....My husband finally pulled me away from our newborn to enjoy my favorite food in the universe (well besides my beloved Italian food) Jamaican food!  I knew I was going to love this place as soon as I walked in.  It was last Friday night.  Very quiet. Nice low music.  Soccer on both television screens.....and the decor--Black, white, elegant, & super simple.  I live for motivational/inspirational quotes so to find them on each table and spread throughout the restaurant was pretty dope! ....and the FoodAs an appetizer we ordered jerk chicken wings.  I'm not quite sure why I didn't get a patty as growing up in NYC (those were a childhood favorite) but the wings alone were hot, fresh, & downright awesome.  Grant it, they taste very similar to the jerk wings I make using the marinade I brought back from Jamaica last summer but they were still delish! Mr. Predictable, oops I meant, Mr. husband ordered the red snapper!  There's something about being presented with an entire fish on your plate (head and all) that just feeds his soul.  I, on the other hand, prefer to not see the face of what I'm eating although that fish was so good.  Seriously people--I don't care for a lot of fish.  I tend to stick with salmon, whiting and tuna but this darn snapper was very well seasoned.  I've never had anything like it.  I'd even go as far as saying, it was better than the one he ordered at our resort in Ocho.  One day I will attempt to prepare it for him but for now I'm too afraid to do so.  I personally ordered the oxtails plate which came with rice & peas, a really fresh side salad that I totally appreciated after eating those jerk wings (with some type of homemade vinaigrette) and plantains on the side.  The oxtails were tender and paired well with the rice.  The only thing I would change about my order would be to add more sweet plantain on the side as I love them soo very much.Are Lasting Impressions!Everything was ridiculously amazing!  The only thing I honestly did not care for was the rum cake I ordered to go.  Perhaps I should have ate it at the restaurant but \"me tummy was full mon\" Other than the cake, I totally am head over heels for this place.  I will definitely be back within the coming weeks. So without further adieu, Ladies and Gents, it is with much happiness & pride that, I present to you under very high recommendation, as my 100th review --Yah Mon!  Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "nzglX08DjGVvUnfn1lASmA", "user_id": "H-JD6TeGQ2OBULx3Afj4PA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "This is my favorite place to eat in Tampa.

Upon arrival you receive a bread basket, croissants and some other soft bread with cream in it. I liked the croissants. We ordered jerk chicken wings as an appetizer and holy moly, they were actually spicy. I was in love! I love me some heat.For my entree, I got the brown stewed fish. The flavor was good, but given all the plating dishes it was a bit difficult to comfortably eat without fear of knocking something over (sides come in their own bowl, fish came in its own plate, and all of these bowls and plate sit on top of another serving plate). The side salad was good. The rice and peas I was not a fan of, the rice felt undercooked and overall it just tasted rather dry. Everyone else at the table got different sampler platters. I tried some and thought the brown ox tail was good as was their curry. We got a roti on the side and that may have been the biggest offence of the night. $5 for 1 plain dhal puri roti. Crazy sauce! It tasted okay, but the outer edges weren't cooked well so it tasted doughy. The ambiance is nice, classy table setup, thematically decorated for valentine's day. Service was a bit slow. If you're looking for an upscale jamaican dining experience, this is it. Otherwise, there's a lot of other good spots around town at a fraction of the cost."}, {"review_id": "iYaS7spysga7q7Nx2suV3Q", "user_id": "UQKxRmpP8-wimOrsB1umWA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/17/2017", "text": "Yah Mon is a hidden gem in every sense of the word - not only because I just now discovered the place, but its location is literally tucked in the back corner of a small plaza near downtown Tampa. I would never have found it without the power of Yelp, and I'm very glad I did!It's situated right next to a laundromat, and across the way from a pharmacy drive-through. Parking wasn't an issue when I went, but perhaps on a very busy night it could be a little tight trying to find a spot. Admittedly, it's not the most posh or romantic setting - but the interior of the restaurant is in absolute contrast to the exterior. It is gorgeously decorated, with great care clearly being taken to exude an atmosphere of elegance and calm. The staff are absolutely amazing - the gentleman who waited on my table was of the utmost professionalism, friendliness, and helpfulness. I can't say enough for how stellar their service is!Getting down to the food, most of what I had I thoroughly enjoyed! I started off with a watermelon soda, which is the perfect mix of sweet, spritzy, and refreshing. My friend ordered a plate of jerk chicken wings, and while I am adverse to spicy food, I did try one - amazing depth of flavor, but the heat kicks in IMMEDIATELY so I wasn't able to finish even one wing. For my main course, I ordered the Taste of the Islands platter, which consisted of oxtails, curry chicken, brown stew chicken, rice and peas (beans), and fried plantains. The oxtails were out of the world delicious - incredibly flavorful and fall-of-the-bone tender! The curry chicken was my second favorite, also with really well-developed flavor, and one of the few curries I can get that's actually NOT spicy - yay! I wasn't a fan of the brown stew chicken - I've had brown stew chicken at other caribbean establishments and this one was far different from any other I've tried. It tasted very tomato-ish, and the gravy was thin and watery, almost vegetable brothy, rather than the thick, rich, slightly sweet gravy I'm familiar with. I also ordered a slice of rum cake, and found it to not only be not very sweet, but it tasted very strongly of raisins...which was unfortunate for me who doesn't like raisins! But in all fairness, perhaps that's how traditional rum cakes are supposed to be, and I should take this as a lesson learned to not order that dessert going forward!All in all, I really enjoyed my experience here. With the exception of a couple dishes not quite meeting the expectations of my palate, I thought their food was delicious, high quality, decently priced, and the staff and ambience are superior to any other caribbean restaurant I've been to. I would definitely recommend giving them a try, whether it's for a date night, family dinner, or catching up with a friend - it's a really nice spot!"}, {"review_id": "yP-reAQDHSAsuIAQ8zoA7g", "user_id": "_j2UmEZVYvT-sqpnJz2UDg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to try this place for the first time Saturday night.
