My fave, the Blue Blazer, combines crispy fried chicken with creamy blue cheese for that hot, melty texure, plus a spicy red cabbage for a refreshing zing...of course on a sweet potato biscuit!  I also typically get the side of seared greens with garlic and chili flakes, for taste and health reasons!  The semi-sketchy location also presents parking challenges; they have taken over the lot accrossed the street.  Still, car pool for safety and convenience. There are 5 tables inside but space is tight with the small establishment. Outdoor seating is small and minimalistic - raised wood counter with milk crates for seats; they've added 3-4 picnic tables too. The concept fits the southern charm environment but the lack of spots could be an issue during peak times, especially if you want to sit with a group. When busy, the staff do a nice job of greeting and serving with a smile. The street corner can have heavy traffic so please keep that in mind if you have kids in tote."}, {"review_id": "eFRGEvcyXouj7nvvz7z09g", "user_id": "sCOjoM_buXFVrnAFLVYktA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Handsome Biscuit is a well known place in the 757. If you have never been, you know you saw your friends posting about it. Located in Norfolk near ODU, it's a gem. The location is very small so if don't grab a table, just know you'll be standing or eating outside (I hope the weather is nice). I had the Hella Fitzgerald and I would def have it again. The chicken was the best part. We also tried the Peanut Butter and Jelly one. That was different, but a good different. The biscuits were warm and fluffy and the \"fillings\" are unique.

From the traditional Shorty (eggs and cheese on a biscuit) to the A. C. Slawter (pulled pork BBQ and apple coleslaw on a biscuit), Handsome Biscuit offers a wide assortment of biscuit based breakfast and lunch entrees. Since the diner is so small, most people come in and get a biscuit to go, though there are a few tables inside and a quiet outdoor seating area in the back. The prices range from roughly $4 to $7 depending on the biscuit, with the intricately prepared biscuits costing slightly more. With that said, the prices are entirely reasonable given that each biscuit is huge and so are the helpings of whatever it contains.Between 9 AM and 12 PM are the peak hours so be prepared to wait if you arrive in this window. The line moves quickly regardless, and you'll be enjoying your biscuit in no time. If you're looking for an affordable and filling breakfast served by an authentic local business, Handsome Biscuit is a great option."}, {"review_id": "x9w92Y07YcSPlyMjIl81Zg", "user_id": "pmX_OHLkQ8n3DPC8ZmKErA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "I have been told that I have not been \"living\" since I have never eaten here before until today.Parking was alright when we arrived but they can get crazy busy so I can imagine the small parking lot becoming full fairly quickly.

I'm not the biggest biscuit fan unless the biscuit is like drowning in sauce, but this place made their biscuits very well. They're made from sweet potatoes and were not too dry. This place does get crowded on during weekend brunch so get ready to stand in line if you go then. But the line moves pretty fast and they get the food out quick. Not too much indoor seating, but plenty outdoor seating.I got the Hella Fitzgerald with over-easy egg instead of bacon. It was delicious omg. The Hella Fitzgerald seemed to be the most popular dish, and now I get why. The cheddar and gravy were perfect with the fried chicken. The fried chicken was super crispy and juicy. This place looked super hipster and your typical brunch spot.

I had the \"Hella Fitzgerald\" sweet potato biscuit sandwich with bacon, cheddar, and sausage gravy. It sounded so good on paper, but when it was executed in front of me I was just left wanting more; furthermore, my initial experience was what kept me from coming back for about 4 years.  Throughout those 4 years I heard nothing but how everyone was loving what HB was serving, and how they were always improving upon their recipes.  I finally gave in and decided to give it another try, and I'm glad I did. I once again got the Hella Fitzgerald, but this time I got their famous hash browns and a side of Lupo Hotsauce.  This time around the food tasted so much better.  They really perfected the recipe of their signature breakfast sandwich, and the Lupo (which was not previously available) added an element of spice that took the whole thing to a new level.  Their hashbrowns were a nice complement to the sandwich too.  Overall, it turns out all the Handsome Biscuit needed to be great was some time.  They're expanding their menu, and they've even opened up a second location.  I can't wait to see them get even better in the future."}, {"review_id": "f9N-bCK49uYYVZ4Nv9V4Dg", "user_id": "PpoXts9bHpHbOqMIHXNa2w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I don't get the hype with this place - long lines and very strange tasting menu items that cannot be customized.  I just don't get the draw.  I should caveat this and say that the last time I went was several years ago, so maybe it's not still the same.  I'll have to go and check it out and update this is I find my comments in error."}, {"review_id": "PxspVqp1gI-HFZ0oHXhl7A", "user_id": "Vrej0IMEY61PR7cp5xo-7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Delicious!

I came in for an early lunch, between coffee shops and chowed down.I went with Fitzgerald - fried chicken, bacon, gravy - WOWZA. It's a monster of a biscuit/sandwich and kept me full will into dinner.Well, ok. I also got the hash browns. 4 chunks of amazing hash browns. Crispy outside and delicious gooey potato inside.At the recommendation of the gentleman at the register I got the homemade soda - delicious and refreshing. I don't recall what fruit it was, but it was really good!They have a few seats inside, but really it's going to be outdoor seating. Luckily it was really nice out, so I didn't mind.Chill playlist while I chowed down outside made for a pretty dope ambiance.

I cannot remember the names of the meals, because silly names were made up for them. When we got our food, it was good and large in size. The sandwich I ordered came with the gravy.

My favorite biscuit by far is the Stevie. Their chicken is just cooked so perfectly and the way the mustard seed and syrup pull the entire thing together is just chaotic genius. Oh, and the biscuits themselves are never a letdown. The overall way their biscuits are presented and the way the flavors come together when you take a bite is always a magical moment!The side of hash with some Lupo sauce on the side is a complete MUST. You gotta try it! And although they aren't known for their desserts, their cookies and brownies are super good too. The portions are pretty big and honestly could feed two people, so be aware of that. Although it might be so good that you won't want to share.The customer service is great and quick. They are always willing to help you out with a decision especially if you're a first timer. There's indoor and outdoor seating, but not much of it; luckily it's never been overly busy when I've gone.
