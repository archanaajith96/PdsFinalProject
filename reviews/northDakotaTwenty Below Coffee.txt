Twenty Below is true artisan coffee. Eco friendly, super star service, excellent coffee. You are charged for to go cups, but I get it and if I didn't need one, I would definitely want to hang out and enjoy the atmosphere anyway. Bring your friends, close your lap top, put down your phones, and enjoy the coffee and toasts and talk to the people your with."}, {"review_id": "kZ-VyDU_IyO8y_sy0cj_Pg", "user_id": "C2q6cv4JE9twXKoe_AyZKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Came here for a coffee on a 10 degree morning and was greeted with a warm welcome, great coffee and super friendly and helpful staff."}, {"review_id": "0D0puPCM7yYLkUElziliJQ", "user_id": "1BT7VwV_ut7UssiApsBPnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/24/2017", "text": "Our second time here- in two days. Friendly and welcoming service. Comfortable ambience- I could just sink into the couch all day.  Food:The hot toddy toast was tasty. If your gonna use jalapeño jam I'm expecting it to have at least a little bit of a kick. If I'm paying $6 for toast you could add a bit more almond butter. The bread and crust were great. Drinks:vanilla bean latte was my favorite. The flavor was well balanced. Carmel latte not so much. The caramel and espresso flavor don't mix well. Dirty chai was well flavored but a bit too watery. Extra star for being environmentally friendly.... Compostable cups/lids, sugar in bowl to spoon out instead of packets, no plastic/styrofoam in sight! Love it! I'm looking forward to coming back to try the matcha latte!"}, {"review_id": "UYhIa_nF3BvmCHsWleSQGQ", "user_id": "hq0iTJTV7gA31VHFenk1iQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/6/2017", "text": "This place a beautiful decor with a very hospitable staff.  I only stopped by for an espresso which was okay.  To preface my review, I have been a barista for many years in seattle and by no means do I think I know everything about coffee but a couple of things erked me about the experience. I find it frustrating when cafe's try to educate people on their unique nomenclature.  I think you should just refer to your espresso as espresso instead of 'triple ristretto.'  There was technically nothing triple about the dosing as 18-22 grams is very common 'double shot' or simply espresso dosing.  Also, there was absolutely nothing ristretto about the shot.  They were much higher in volume than most espresso I get around the country at the same dose. With all this being said, I am a self identifying coffee snob.. but I can taste and see quality when it exists even if my experience doesn't fully support it. This place looks and holds quality as an utmost standard and is no doubt an absolute gem in Fargo. You're a special cafe without having to prove it with a different naming mechanism than everyone else."}, {"review_id": "uS3uy0OcgpKagR-e2o0O_g", "user_id": "YaLxfO1sCqQPSy-7QKkd1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Incredible atmosphere, delicious coffee roasts, and inspiring vision for the Fargo community."}, {"review_id": "4lUC9A2T4BWlVA-xvsObyw", "user_id": "Rg5nLMSEnY8XtUZcRZDrsQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "love this place! best coffee shop in Fargo! employees are always so nice and considerate. make sure to try the oat milk in your drink!!"}, {"review_id": "i414XCIUnzn986xavQggDQ", "user_id": "TbSz8Hs2dHUz2lTS55kOXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "This coffee shop has great coffee & such a welcoming atmosphere!

Oh and they also prepare and serve some awesome coffee, the best waffle I've had and amazing baked goods. The space is very different than most run of the mill coffee shops. For starters, they have a coffee bar like a sushi bar where you can watch your drinks being made and interact with the 'barista'. They have comfortable couches and community style benches with free wifi. In our case, the owner Mike made my caramel latte and we chatted about pretty much everything under the sun. What stood out was how humble Mike is but also his involvement with the community. The caramel latte and the blueberry waffle are some of the best I've had. The waffle was served with goat cheese!! Who would have thought that the two would go together so well. They make their own caramel in house and it certainly reflected in the taste. The waffle and some other  baked good are gluten free. The entire menu is intriguing and I would love to try more of their offering on my next visits."}, {"review_id": "f4MDFyo5Y8KT8iVykhN-MA", "user_id": "BEPsIY9ZXzFni1uC3GXxRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2016", "text": "This place is wonderful! As soon as you walk in the baristas greet you and make you feel like old friends! it was very obvious who had been in there before and they had many customers names memorized, I was super impressed! on to the food: the coffee came fast, hot and delicious. I ordered an Americano and they did not skimp on the size at all. The coffee with a more nutty medium/mellow test and didn't need sugar to not taste bitter. the shot was pulled well and had a good layer of crema to prove it. They had an assortment of gluten free maroons that were absolutely delicious. they were not traditional flavors and that was really awesome! my Americano and three cookies came to about $8 which is completely reasonable for a good tasting cup of coffee and cookies. I highly recommend this place for studying or catching up with friends and be sure to get some cookies! p.s. the couches are super comfortable."}, {"review_id": "zwEATtGKH-pDfMg6tiBOqQ", "user_id": "DYJmLo4rTABUpVjWvJL7Og", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2017", "text": "If you are in or drive through Fargo and love or even just like coffee this is a place you MUST try!!!!!The vibe offers a good blend of college students and professionals that can even seem a bit refreshingly ambiguous. This makes for an extremely approachable coffee shop experience that is open to everyone, no matter your knowledge and experience of coffee. Every staff member that I met was jovial and Mike remembered me by name all three days I visited. There are a range of drinks from a nitro cold brew to a Eropress and what seems like everything in between. For those of you who work remotely, this is a great place to sit down for extended periods and bang away on the ol keyboard. Calls may be a bit of a challenge, but what coffee shop isn't. They do close over the noon hour which I found a good time to get something to eat and take a break."}, {"review_id": "Gh62IbCU9DQuVSTdHom3lQ", "user_id": "1GvHfv91lzAYtGKvy_VYyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/6/2016", "text": "This is a true gem of the Downtown Fargo area. As a new member to the community this place has welcomed me with open arms AND they have amazing coffee. I mean it is the best coffee I have ever had, bar none, hands down, its the best. Why is it the best? Because you can get several premium coffee grounds that are brewed in a variety of fashions to extract a particular taste, strenght, aroma etc.. from the coffee. Don't ask me to explain it all, I am only a few methods in but I have not found any I have not liked. The place is a little intimidating at first.... Mike maybe you should make a big version of the brew methods chart??? It seems pretentious here as well at first glance. In the end every staff member is there to make you feel at home and serve you great coffee. They go out of there way to make your day a little brighter.  Half of the battle of customer service is making the customer feel at home, they accomplish this from the very moment you walk in the door. It is no wonder they have so many regulars."}, {"review_id": "2YMZZ9HlSgyZ-48cwMMtAw", "user_id": "pxRszHLAnbJcU9oG00KdQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "The service is fantastic and the coffee is pretty good.

While the cappuccino was a bit more expensive than competitors, it was fantastic. It was brewed well enough that the espresso wasn't overly bitter as some coffee shops tend to be. A little too 'hipster' for my taste, but not unexpected.
