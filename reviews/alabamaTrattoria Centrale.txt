I camped out here with a laptop over lunch and tea on a rainy Wednesday. Since there were always a couple of tables free, I didn't feel too bad for staying so long, but they would have been well within their rights to kick me out. Instead they gave me a extra slice of pizza because they thought \"the first one was too small\" and refused to let me pay for an iced tea because they \"were going to throw it out anyway.\" And the two items I actually paid for - a slice of veggie pizza and the bowl of lentil soup - were both delicious. Maybe it was a slower day than usual and so everyone was less formal, but I'll bet the staff are great like this all the time. I hope these guys make good money off tips and regular customers. Great spot, super friendly and welcoming."}, {"review_id": "V_H3e-eBkEaAwMMl9m9pPw", "user_id": "2DCKZKJhVuHPaT7_tf0Khw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "After an evening at Topgolf we were looking for a different spot to try....thanks to all the great Yelp reviews it was a pretty easy decision to try this place out. I have to admit I was a little surprised when we walked in to find that it was a very casual environment. Very few indoor and outdoor seats available. You seat yourself and get in line at the kitchen/counter to place your food order. As we stood in line to order our food I liked that they cook every dish fresh. So they don't have a huge pasta dish that is sitting back there on warmers that they are scooping out of. They have some different twists to traditional dishes, but if you aren't super excited to try their version of spaghetti with their ingredients you can ask them to hold anything and it's no problem. That's why it's a huge bonus they cook the dinners fresh with each order, otherwise you wouldn't be able to hold things.I went with their 2 slices of pizza and a small salad combo meal. I wasn't overly excited about the salad because it was arugula which isn't my favorite. To be honest outside of kale it has to be my least favorite in the salad family. To my surprise with the salad dressing they offered, this was really good! I would probably order this again. For the pizza I went with the broccoli pizza for one slice and their version of a meat lover for the other slice. Started with the meat flavor this was packed with flavor. Really flavorful sauce and the perfect amount of cheese. The downside this was so good the broccoli pizza really didn't impress, which is too bad because it was probably really good, just not as good as the first slice.Prices aren't too bad and the atmosphere, even though it is very casual, is really charming. It seemed like quite a few people got orders to go. I would guess that's because wait times to get a table can probably be rally bad at regular meal times.Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Food had great flavor. This place would be worthy of a return visit...if you haven't been here before, try them out."}, {"review_id": "yZft6s5c14iWpG5pN9Xg4w", "user_id": "3-i2FV18OyiicGgNYfsMAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Trattoria Centrale will always have a place in my Foodie heart. It was, after all, the setting of my first interview for my first book.Just as memorable? The Cider Waffles ($11). Accompanied by cinnamon apples, candied pecans, maple syrup and bacon - this loaded breakfast was as pleasing to the palette as it was to the eyes. Layers of flavors. Yum.I would have preferred my bacon candied to counter the sweetness, but I digress. As is, it's a winner. I (almost) felt bad for my company that morning. They sipped on coffee, while I DESTROYED my dish. Almost (lol I offered, they declined, so there's that).Meanwhile, I'd like to circle back and try out some of their lunch menu. The eatery, which is in downtown Birmingham, has a glass divider which allows you to watch their artists at work. This includes making bread, which was cool.I give this place one thumbs up - the other thumb is still eating the cider waffle!"}, {"review_id": "U1a_dNIlpV31uauqgRXnNw", "user_id": "6_d_HhciAacx7Ntj1xIFsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I would like to update my review this year to include our Friday night dining experience which included some fantastic pasta and a delectable bowl of Tiramisu!Let's be honest Birmingham. There are not enough Italian restaurants in this city. Especially ones like this that hit a very reasonable price point. We arrived to meet a couple of friends and enjoy a almost candle-lit dinner. I liked it because there wasn't a line out the door and its such a small dining room that it just felt really quaint and private. We arrived without the need for a reservation. It was filling up inside but we managed to snag a table. I ordered the bucatini all'amatriciana w/ meatballs, shiitakes, leeks & pecorino. WOW. It was fantastic. There's nothing like a great bowl of perfectly cooked pasta. The meatballs were also some of the best i've ever had. It was THAT good. Finally, for dessert, we ordered the Tiramisu. It's an ALL TIME favorite of mine. I'd heard from an acquaintance that it's one of the best in the city  and they were right. It was fantastic. If you're looking for a reasonable Italian dinner spot, try the special Friday Dinner menu at Trattoria Centrale. It's an outstanding meal that will make your weekend feel that much longer and better!"}, {"review_id": "KlAXEdaT4lcLtGK1yY4C_g", "user_id": "e6MfKsE55-KXAK6eGp7z5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Love this place for coffee and didn't realize it had a cult brunch following!!!

As to be expected, I came around late noon and there was still a line forming out of the door. Luckily after ordering, a friend and I managed to snag a table outside. Service was efficient, fast, and everyone was more than friendly and accommodating. I ordered a little of various things so that I could try a little of each. My orders consisted of the French toast, breakfast pizza, and frittata. They use challah bread for the French toast and let me tell you, it is more than lovely. Portions were huge, but it wasn't just quantity, it was also quality. Everything tasted more than amazing. The only thing worth noting is that it is a relatively small space, so yes, it does get very cramp with how busy they are. Definitely a top pick in my brunch rotation from now on!"}, {"review_id": "k0TuMik2ghJUz6F--5vEUA", "user_id": "gd2bDddpEbl0YHMNvIbDHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "This is one of our favorites for lunch and brunch so I was excited to try their Friday night dinner.

We are big tiramisu fans so we had to get that also but I wasn't impressed at all. Everyone else at the table loved it so maybe it was just me but I didn't like the texture.

If you do, then you have to try Trattoria for brunch. They use Challah bread with marscapone in between then topped with blueberries or strawberries with maple syrup and bacon. This dish will put a smile on your face for weeks because it was beyond incredible!! Another item that was out of this world was the peach scone. Sometimes scones can be hard as rocks. This one was soft, warm and very fresh. The only downside of this restaurant on Sunday brunch time is the long wait in line. You order at the register and because there are so many people, you might be in line 20 to 30 minutes. Good for them for having such a high quality of food that customers are willing to wait in line that long!!"}, {"review_id": "-nRI0BoDozi1LnEFY-PX7Q", "user_id": "Qz7XU2bJfdAR_va18B5Ulw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "I love coming here for breakfast/brunch! The food is amazing, I usually get the egg frittata that they made for the day or one of their scones. Their food is always fresh and I love how you can see them cooking behind the glass. I really like how you can order a meal here for around $11, but you can also order just a scone or a frittata for closer to $5 if you want. Sadly, the space is really small so finding a seat can be difficult during peak times.

Okay, how many are recognized Yelp stops?The reason I bring this up, is because we stayed at the Redmont Hotel during a recent visit to Birmingham and we were looking for a good spot to eat. Trattoria Centrale was one I had bookmarked before our trip, so we figured that we would try it out!I wasn't sure what to think once we walked inside, as it actually seemed super busy, but everyone seemed to know what to order. The full menu is located right next to the entrance. The daily menu is located on the overhead chalk board. We both ended up ordering frittatas. I will tell you, faithful Yelp review reader person, that their frittatas are SUPER FLUFFY and practically melt in your mouth. No joke! Totally surprised!I had a cup of their coffee, which was delicious as well. I know I can't just judge a place by their cup of coffee, but seriously you have to have a good cup of coffee when you are out grabbing breakfast. Lucky for me, they brew Octane coffee here. I'm always looking for local coffee, and I found it here!Even though the place was busy, service was really quick and seating was not a problem. I'd come back here again, for sure!"}, {"review_id": "K-_BUgtm-lPiSX_LIuluGA", "user_id": "PockA0Z-HXY_bdnp2qVtyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "I love this place.

Arrived about 12:30 on a Friday, and surprisingly, I missed the rush. The menu is short and simple. Lots of choices when it comes to pasta, but three simple choices for pizza, i'm sure that may vary from ay today. Today's selection was a pork pizza, pepperoni, or veggie.I got the lunch special which was two slices of pizza with a side mixed salad (each pizza slice is only $2.75). The dressing was balsamic vinaigrette and appeared to be homemade and was very tasty. The salas is simply mixed greens, so don't expect a bunch of vegetables or anything.Staff was super friendly, i actually engaged in a conversation for quite some time with the person who was taking my order. The pizza is heated upon ordering so it takes a few minutes while they place your order in the oven and get everything together. Well worth the wait though. Small seating area on the inside, may set about 20 people but the tables are small The outside is the same way.I've heard great things about brunch and that you need to be there before the door opens up so that you can place an order or consider the trip wasted. I live on the other side of town and the location closes at 3pm so I don't see myself visiting often unless i'm on a quick lunch break like today."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/trattoria-centrale-birmingham-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
