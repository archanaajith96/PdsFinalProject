Get home to see the cheesy garlic bread looked and tasted exactly like the frozen cheesy Texas toast you get from the grocery store, only cut in half... Not impressed Ziggy's!! The pizza was mediocre. Maybe if we would of dined in our experience would have been better, but that damn cheesy garlic bread made me mad!"}, {"review_id": "xG9_XXtMeuVfo5EVJsqlCg", "user_id": "V6ppuVNQDdvv26BNxs7NHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Great pizza.

I think I will give Dempsey's next door, a try tomorrow......"}, {"review_id": "mnV-psUprRPzSU-2LfH5Vg", "user_id": "FvgHMzoaIrcZdUBQthzFfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "Overall good for lunch     Service: Excellent      Food: Excellent      Atmosphere: Friendly     Crowd: Family oriented"}, {"review_id": "wS8rgqo0vThpxYPRUtwvpg", "user_id": "D5w6HdM8vjpZ4-SUxI11Rw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/10/2017", "text": "Love love love this place.

We had a little bit of a wait to be seated, but it was totally worth it.Ordered BBQ Chicken and Missi's mix. They were both delicious. Missi's Mix was the perfect combo of meat and banana peppers.

Beer was fresh and hit the spot with the fantastic pizza.The staff is very friendly and attentive.

The pizza isn't your traditional pizza pie, but rectangle served on a tray.     I went with a party of 5 on a Friday night. The room we dined in was an extension to the building. It did not have central AC, only fans which this particular day was blowing around hot and humid air.

I've ate at Dempseys so I knew right where to go, but it's a cute little house/cottage looking place in Clifton square off Douglas east of Hillside. There's a nice patio with plenty of seating. I made sure to go during their lunch special, a piece of pizza (I got two large squares) of the one specials with pineapple and Italian salad. Great fresh salad and amazing pizza. I ordered one of their \"supreme\" style pizzas to go for family. It was great all around. Wonderful service. Charming bar area.
