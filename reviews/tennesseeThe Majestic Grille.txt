You don't have to be dressed to the nine's but you should certainly be respectable. I'm talking linen table cloths and cloth napkins, etc. But that doesn't mean the atmosphere is stuffy, because it isn't. It's a very relaxing and unpretentious place. It seems that it was an old movie theater, I believe, and they were showing old movies on the screen on the wall (what a fun touch!).We kicked things off with a round of their signature drinks (rather well made) before enjoying some bread and a few apps. For dinner I had the filet and it was delicious! They cooked it perfectly and the accoutrements (veggies and sauce) were the cherries on top. YUM! The rest of our group had an assortment of items but everyone agreed that the food was on point.The prices are a bit higher but, as I said, it's a nice place. They are by no means outlandish. And the service and wait staff attention was at a level that kept the meal flowing and enjoyable for everyone.We had a great dinner here and I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a solid dinner spot in Memphis."}, {"review_id": "jPjGtSzwWpu1wiUy7Rhy_w", "user_id": "D_P7_4ZR3VHc4acHFdtSfQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Wish I could give at least four but this place missed the mark. They lost our reservation that we made using their system. When we showed the confirmation email they sent us the staff still could not find our reservation. To top it off they said \"they would see if they can fit us in.\" Very poor in my opinion. The complimentary biscuits were a pleasant surprise and my wife loved that they came with plenty of butter. I had the crab cake Benedict which was par for the course. The cake was dense and lacked larger chunks of crab. The eggs were different temperatures; one was completely runny and perfect while the other was significantly over cooked. The English muffin was smaller than normal and there was barely any hollandaise. The side of potatoes, onions, and peppers was perfectly cooked and the potatoes were very tender without being dry. You should try it but be wary of their reservation system, especially because you must have a reservation here for brunch."}, {"review_id": "WNZaiDX9ELXKtbpCqDHeNQ", "user_id": "cHXlUUtC1FyqdQDScA0JFg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "This was our first visit to Memphis and The Majestic Grille was fantastic. We went for brunch and everything was great. Dress code can be anything from suit and tie to shorts and a tshirt....whatever you feel comfortable in. The decor and setting are definitely first class.You can do a bottle of champagne with your selection of juice for only $15 so very reasonable and you can't beat the options and price. We tried the grapefruit and orange juices.Their homemade biscuits were super good and I'm picky about my biscuits. Our kids loved them as well. Add some gravy and you are in heaven.Overall the food, service and venue was fabulous. Would definitely go again. I do recommend making reservations!"}, {"review_id": "Vn4xAEy8WQa6OFfMmBcPpw", "user_id": "ebKoBKf8OcMDDAUmm_QLAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "It was a happy accident that we ended up here for Easter brunch, but it turned out to be better than the place we were originally schedule to dine.Sat in the upper level, where we really got to appreciate the architecture of the place. For those unaware, the building was first a silent movie house, built in 1913. Note, the bathroom is downstairs only. The waitstaff is excellent. For brunch, biscuits came free, and mimosa very well priced at $4. Brother said the French toast was nothing special, but he says this about every French toast. Grain of salt. Dad had the andouille frittata, and he was all about it. Looked amazing. I had the crab cake benedict, where the eggs were perfectly poached but atop obviously frozen fish-stick-like crab cakes. Lastly, the cheese grits were good but could be cheesier. All in all we'll certainly be back to try more at such affordable prices for a great experience."}, {"review_id": "-IT3qys7ZBxq42TTfLy6uQ", "user_id": "ObJUkjEYXTAHl6xFjFQjNg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "First of all: Saturday brunch with mimosa's. I love that you can get a bottle of champagne and decanter of fresh orange juice with orange slices to keep your glass full at your table. I loved hearing all the cork \"pops\" the whole time we were there. The ambiance and decor is cool. We were brought a basket of warm biscuits with butter. Very nice especially once you have started on the mimosa! I appreciate butter but would have loved (and expected) some fresh jam. I noticed in another table the plastic single jellies like you would see at a diner. What? That didn't fit this place at all. Our breakfast was delicious. The bacon was great-not flimsy or too greasy, eggs cooked right. The crab Benedict was fabulous. The breakfast potatoes were seasoned wonderfully. I never thought of myself of one to like grits. Perhaps it's because I never really tasted good grits. These were off the chain! This will definitely be a must stop every time I'm in Memphis from now on. Super staff too!"}, {"review_id": "1PYczyjy0M-qJSqiVnYQ8Q", "user_id": "jHq3BSrhiqANPKj_lGHb3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "I came here with my family after seeing the early showing of Wicked. I had never been but my sister suggested it and since it was so close by we decided to give it a shot. They had just opened and luckily had a table open for six people. We ended up on the top floor. My mom worried it would mean they would forget us but there was a bar up there which almost constantly had a waiter or two doing some errand or another. I liked that we were on the top floor because we had a perfect view of the movie screen they had showing some old black and white flick. Apparently this used to be an old movie theater. It was such a unique feature that if I ever returned, I would request to be on the top floor but even closer to the screen. They had a pre-theater menu for Wicked, which was having another showing that night. I ended up selecting from that mostly because I didn't see much on the main menu that appealed to me. I might try the flatbreads next time or the lemon chicken, but not much beyond that unless a friend let me try theirs. Unfortunately, we had an extraordinarily long wait time. I mean to the point where we had run out of conversation topics and were all just staring at one another and the empty bread basket. My dad was saying he didn't think he'd want to return here, which I don't think I've ever heard him say over a wait time. Both the waiter and the manager went to check in on it. A lady came and apologized for the wait but we hadn't been fed yet so we were pretty quiet. When the food came out, two of the meals had been undercooked. What really saved it for my parents is that they took those two things off the bill. They also gave us a free flight of dessert for the long wait. We each grabbed a different one so they didn't have to worry about bringing any doubles for anyone. I would come back, but with a patient group.

I love the ambiance, the staff, and the food. It is located on Main St. in the heart of Downtown across the street from the historic Orpheum Theater. Yes, you will have to pay to park whether you pay the meter or park in the lot across the street, but that's a part of dining downtown. However, it is well worth it! This is a great place to go for a romantic date night or lunch. They have a reasonably priced menu. I normally get the smoked salmon or a mixed green salad. It is DELICIOUS! They also have a fantastic lunch menu with prices as low as $8! Not bad for such a fine restaurant. The staff is always a joy and the take pride in their service to their customers.

It is located right downtown in Memphis and they open at 11 am for brunch. I was a little surprised to find that given the weather, they don't even open up their front entry way for Patrons to wait until they open. So make sure you bundle up if you get there early as you will have to wait.Once inside, the restaurant is quite beautiful and very elegant. We were seated quite quickly. We ordered a bottle of champagne for mimosas and had orange juice and grapefruit juice, both of which appeared to be fresh. The price was very reasonable at $15/bottle.They brought homemade biscuits with butter and honey while we waited for our food. There were 4 of us and amongst us we had the crab cake benedict, biscuits and gravy with eggs and a side of potatoes, french toast with a side of bacon. The biscuits were small but the gravy was delicious. The french toast had a nice little crunch coating on it...not too much just enough to set it apart. The crab cake benedict was delicious as well.

Perhaps I didn't order the correct food but I sampled from different dishes that my family members ordered and really don't have much to say about them. I ordered the in house smoked ribs and they were extremely dry and under seasoned. We didn't even get a side of bbq sauce to try dip the meat. The burger tasted just like any burger and the pasta was nothing too spectacular. The best part of the meal was the bread and butter. Bread was made in house and just super moist and flavorful.  The flat bread crust was crispy and I would rEcommend getting if you do come here. The service and atmosphere were outstanding.

Once I saw they had a screen with old movies playing and I saw the menu content, I was completely sold.Turns out...I was right. Everything from the walls to the lighting to the palm trees equals perfection in my book. The minimal lighting is just my thing. I love, love, love restaurants that have great acoustics and low lighting. So relaxing. The old black and white movies just are the cherry on top.I was just able to try the burger, but that was also just the way I like it. Lots of grilled flavor, toasty buttery bun, pink in the center.

I was very happy to have found this lovely haven from the heat where I could sit with my coworkers and relax after our flight and before our crazy week starts on a beautiful and large patio.We sat outside in the shade and there was a breeze, perfect for some Mimosa filled people watching. Also I must say, getting a bottle of non-bottom of the shelf champagne and a pitcher of OJ to share for $15 was AMAZING. I'm accustomed to the absurd brunch prices of DC, so I will be longing for the Majestic Grille brunch for a long time.The Filet Mignon Benedict was light and tasty, the meat was cooked a little more than I would like, but they didn't ask what temperature I wanted it cooked to. The home fries were served with peppers and onions, yum! They also served these perfectly fluffy biscuts with a sweet butter that I had to keep myself from filling up on.

We walked in and thought the interior was elegant but as a sucker for outdoor dinning - went with the patio option.  Salads and some veggie flatbreads were the only good vegetarian options on the menu. The \"old post Waldorf salad\" and \"artichoke with spinach flatbread\" is what we went with. Presentation was superb - the taste equally food. The salad was fresh and nicely mixed. The flatbread was crisp and veggies on the top were delectable. Really enjoyed the simple meal. Their house focaccia bread with whipped butter serving was modest but the bread was warm and yummy. Quite surprised why not many patrons were dinning outside - granted it was warm and a bit humid, but was still pleasant. Soon found out - bUgS!!! Be prepared to eat and be eaten if you sit outside.

I was excited to try the majestic grille after hearing about their delicious brunch. My friend and I showed up around 10:48am on a Sunday and asked for a table for 2. The host told us that unless we had a reservation, she couldn't seat us because they were completely booked....but kindly informed us that if we went down the block and around the corner, we could find plenty of places to eat. Well thanks, I guess. The restaurant barely looked full. We were told we could sit at the bar, but that was first come, first serve and of course that was full. As an out of town guest, I was completely turned off by the restaurant. No where on the website does it say that reservations are REQUIRED for Sunday nor does it say that their first come, first serve bar is only big enough for about 15 people. Maybe leave some tables available for those who are walk ins, instead of turning business away next time. Just a thought."}, {"review_id": "oHUOac_EwPFK7HaCjcoQQQ", "user_id": "nD__ks_tx2L9qkvlyn_N_w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The Majestic gives you the feeling that you are not in Memphis anymore.
