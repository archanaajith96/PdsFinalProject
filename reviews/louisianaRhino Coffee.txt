I am visiting from San Diego, it's been about a year since I've been here so I for sure wanted to come back for the coffee and food. All I knew is I ordered this delicious jalapeño biscuit sandwich with avocado and bacon... what I forgot is that those are add-ons. I'm docking a star or two because they didn't upsell avocado, bacon, or the Jalapeño biscuit! I would've definitely paid a premium for that. I'm sure my egg and biscuit will be delicious anyway.I'll change my review once I come back, hopefully before I leave this trip."}, {"review_id": "qCd5fOZpuCv55mToRM7i0Q", "user_id": "amB6jtxIOUzsn_dfanYMjA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "When I arrived, there were 4 people standing behind the counter. I think I stood there for a good 30 seconds waiting until one of them finally stepped up to the register. I ordered a cold brew coffee and the tomato pesto sandwich on my visit today. The sandwich came at reasonable time, but the barista forgot about my coffee. After I reminded him, he quickly brought out my order and gave a \"free drink\" coupon to make up for it- which was a plus. Personally, I think the sandwich was a bit overpriced. However, it still tasted delicious. I wish they had a fruit or veggie option to substitute the kettle chips for. This place is a nice environment for light studying or coffee dates/catch ups. Probably wouldn't suggest the place for a quick coffee run...but do recommend if you're not in a hurry or you're planning on staying for a bit. There's plenty of room inside and outside. Also, cheers to the one barista who took time to start conversations with customers"}, {"review_id": "RYgeqRrw_m8wRJ36zN973Q", "user_id": "lmjrL9BIBt7kr4EpeMOSBg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Espress\"NO\" ! Walking into Rhino Coffee I was so excited to spend only $15 on two large drinks that are smaller than Starbucks venti!!!!!! Yay!! I was also thrilled to have tasted it and felt the cinnamon crunch between my teeth. It was amazing!!!! I've never had to chew my coffee before, it was delightful! My Instagram photos turned out great with the addition of cinnamon in my teeth!!! On a serious note, today on an early morning Starbucks run I paid $7.50 for two venti iced americanos with light soy. For an afternoon pick me up we decided to try Rhino Coffee because of the great reviews on yelp! No exaggeration the total was $15 for two large \"east side lattes\" with soy. Had the drink been consumable the price wouldn't have been SUCH an issue. Maybe just order a black coffee instead."}, {"review_id": "XI81ZcxNt3eSKu3GdVllWg", "user_id": "qKtjtdISb8UigO7WuuaAmw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "We ordered a chai tea latte and an Americano, both were watered down.  Definitely a disappointment in addition to the extremely long wait time."}, {"review_id": "T4yaS326uEskqyP7tf2qkg", "user_id": "qRvsaSrw72KfzTnVn1t3Og", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/19/2017", "text": "How have I not left a review for this place yet? Rhino is a wonderful addition to Shreveport/Bossier. I would venture to say it is better than any other local coffee shop AND any national franchise. Rhino offers a wide variety of breakfast, brunch, lunch, and even dinner. I would highly recommend enjoying a chicken salad sandwich on the back patio. Magic.The wide variety of coffee drinks is delectable. You can't go wrong with an Iced Lightning. In fact, if you only visit this place once in your life (once is not enough, but if...), you need to indulge in an Iced Lightning. It is a staple, if not a signature. Rhino never disappoints with seasonal drinks as well... you don't ever want to pass up a Wooly Rhino, a Candied Pumpkin Latte, or whatever winter coffee creations they have at a time.This is the best restaurant/coffee shop in Shreveport/Bossier. If I have one negative thing to say about Rhino, it is that there isn't one where I live now. (I lived in Shreveport for 25 years. Every time I return to visit family, my husband and I make it a point to have at least one Rhino stop while in town.)"}, {"review_id": "KFL6Q4pa9MCTVHXTgYkYDQ", "user_id": "AKV4k6dwrZvI-LBrbS_HmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "Had the candied pumpkin latte with almond milk. It was very enjoyable! Comfortable place with different rooms and a big window which is great. Wish they would serve in actual cups instead of paper as it destroys the experience and makes it feel cheap.

Immediately once pulling up I knew I was in for a treat. I came around noon on Sunday and it was pretty busy. It didn't take long for me to place my order. I originally had in mind I was going to try the coffee but it was peak heat in the after noon so I got Blueberry Lemonade, fruit cup, and roast beef sandwich. I found me somewhere to sit and within about 20 mins my food came to my table. Food was really good. Service was also good. The atmosphere inside is rustic but comfy. Stepping outside I decided to eat out on the back garden patio area. It was perfect shade and definitely a nice view.

A bit pricy, but so is starbucks, the coffee is very good and more importantly, local. They have interesting seasonal drinks, some of my favorites being the lavender latte and the wooly rhino which is like a creamy coffee icee. The ambience is chill. A lot of students like to hang out here, either studying or just chilling. Surprisingly a lot of adults as well, such as professionals on a lunch break or having casual meetings.

Everything else about this place is great; the pastries, breakfast items, and sandwiches. Very cozy atmosphere, plus it's local! The problem is, they underwhelm on the most important thing a coffee shop is supposed to do; make good coffee. Their coffee tastes burnt (espresso and drip). Reminiscent of Starbucks... except Starbucks has the excuse of being a worldwide chain that over-roasts their beans to avoid inconsistency in their brews. What's Rhino's excuse? If you've ever had French Truck or Stumptown in New Orleans, Rhino's coffee is definitely not up to par. Unfortunate, because everything else is great! Just... hard to give more than 3 stars to a coffee shop with mediocre coffee. I still frequent this place when I'm in Shreveport, both because of how great everything else is and because of limited alternatives."}, {"review_id": "qkxSoBuQz9YFckSvPHQeCg", "user_id": "bth93DgxalpZaQmWnVtFfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "Great local shop with well trained Batista's.
