This was the first place we came to wine and dine in Detroit on a birthday date weekend, just my wife and I. And first things first, we were wowed by the friendliness and warmth of our waiter Omar. He got us some stiff dirty martinis and nice succulent, juicy calamari to begin with. We also got another meaty favorite appetizer called: \"Albondigas Caseras\". These were tasty lamb/beef meatballs in a cumin flavored tomato sauce and garnished with some almonds. Unique Cuban twist on meatballs. As the Friday hours wound down, we got in our dinner order before the kitchen stops cooking - around 10:30 or so. A delicious, juicy skirt steak meal called \"Churrasco con Chimichurri\" served sizzling on the iron skillet it was made on, with roasted potatoes, fresh veggies, and the sweet authentic touch of some plantain pieces. Loved the shareable meaty meal and after having appetized on 2 top choices prior.We ended the night dancing to some live DJ salsa music lessons and then open floor DJ dance too. A wonderful date night in a festive, unique atmosphere to Detroit. A grown crowd, that doesn't get rowdy. Reasonable pricing, and excellent wait staff. Really a must try for apps, drinks and late dinner and dancing on a Detroit date night. Ideal for the 7pm-11:30pm window in my opinion. Two thumbs up!"}, {"review_id": "NzwdZy85-A4EoXMWQu0AzA", "user_id": "fVGtxs1XN6rW0jsIPXMhyg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Horrible is an understatement!! Made reservations 1 week ahead of time to have dinner after my graduation ceremony. Service was so incredibly slow and inattentive. Took our server 15 minutes just to come over and greet our table. Our appetizers took 1 hour!!!  Our waitress disappeared so we were asking the bus boy for more water, coffee, and bread (since we were hungry and that was available) After 1 hour and 45 minutes of waiting for our dinner we asked to get the check to leave. The table next to us who arrived long after us had received their food. When asked why, they told us they called ahead. I called and made reservations and spoke with someone to confirm my reservations. Why was I not told to preorder my food as well? By this point we were tired, hungry, and very upset with the subpar service. Our waitress finally emerged and told us she was in the back cooking because they were short staff. Why wouldn't you cook your own tables food?! We had to argue with the hostess to remove the food that we never received. There was no manager in sight. The hostess was not very friendly from the get go, but then to charge people for food they never received? And not even apologize for what had happened was extremely shocking. By this time it had been 2 hours with no food. I was shocked that they wanted to charge us after we had been waiting 2 hours and still had not received our dinner!! The only sincere apology for the horrible horrible horrible service and circumstances was the bus boy. The waitress just kept making excuses as to why everything went horribly wrong. I honestly believe she forgot about us or forgot to put our food in. Needless to say the 8 of us left hungry and very unhappy. This WAS my favorite restaurant! We Have been coming here for three years, each time the service gets worse. Yesterday just crossed the line! Completely unacceptable way to treat your customers. I advice anyone looking for good service to go elsewhere. Unless you want to wait over 2 hours for your food!"}, {"review_id": "abM2jW9cd2Y7amArLvQ8mQ", "user_id": "PKLwQp8v_xE9hWG9ZwTIpg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Ok so good paella. Good tostone's and that's about it. Croquettes are ok too. The salmon I got was smelly and I had to send it back. I also think the skirt steak was not so good.  The tres leches is not bad.The wine selection was poor. Awful actually!!!! They need good wine here with the heaviness of the food a nice bottle of red can carry you a long way. Please expand your wine selection. The bar tenders also have an attitude for no reason especially the female bartender was just full of attitude. She needs to bring it down a notch. The male bartender did not know his wine but he was nice and tried his best. Or perhaps this place just does not cater to the wine drinker and apparently they just place it on the menu to be appeasing for no reason.Another thing is starting the salsa past 10 pm is obnoxious!!!! Who does that? People leave this place by 10 there was barely anyone there. They at least need to start a little earlier so people get to enjoy it. The restaurant was empty by 10 and as we were leaving they said dancing was about to start!!! Does not make sense. They need to start latest at 9:30 pm or sooner. This aspect of has always frustrated me. If you want salsa go to cantina diabolo instead more dancing there."}, {"review_id": "ZO5E5kmay8hK_s95xfGyTw", "user_id": "C-zRQRICTNk6zaxnQ1VdmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Great place downtown for live music, dancing, and/or really good food.

They are thick sliced pieces with not a ton of breading (just the way they should be). The sauce and capers make it so flavorful. We also had the ropa vieja last visit and it was delicious, and I'm not even a big meat eater!

We had a large party of 10 for my 30th birthday dinner. Let me start off by saying the food was overall good and our actual server did a good job. This is where it went wrong, upon delivery of our food a hostess came up to our table and said \"you will need to finish up by 10:30pm because we need to move your table from the dance floor. It's company policy. When your party called they didn't tell us they wanted to stay for salsa.\" I responded \"so you're telling us we need to rush through our dinner\" (Mind you it's about 9:30pm and we all JUST got our food and were planning on having desert.) She said \"yes, I have to clear this area by 10:30.\" At this point I told the hostess to bring me her manager. The manager talked to one of our party on the side and assured us we were fine and not to rush and that the initial encounter should not have happened. Okay great but everyone was already in a bad mood because of the way the hostess approached the table and nothing was done to make that better. I left feeling unappreciated as a patron after paying for a nearly $700 tab for my party. An apology to the entire table or at least a measly round of drinks on the house would have at least shown that they were sincerely sorry for the actions of their hostess, instead the next time I want to drop that much on dinner I will go somewhere else."}, {"review_id": "cnBcKIUU6z-icDYGkQV5xA", "user_id": "AsNIsOI8uthp6qfQhW36_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "I know nothing about Cuban cuisine or culture, but I know a lot about flavor!

This is one of the most popular \"hidden gems\" of Detroit. Make sure you try this place!Good size restaurant with outdoor patio in the warm months. Their drink menu is amazing, I've had everything on it. My favorite drink is their caipirinha, comparable to a Brazilian mojito. You can add flavor to it. What makes it unique is the Brazilian rum - this drink is sweet but not too sweet. Very refreshing!They have a large variety of tapas (appetizers) and a full menu. My favorite tapas are the calamari, papas rellenos & empanadas. I can honestly say everything I've tried here I like, haven't had anything I didn't like. My favorite entree is the ropa vieja - such a treat! The beef is so tender, juicy & bursting with flavor. It takes a strong Despina to order something else off the menu since I love their ropa vieja dish.Most dishes come with a side of veggies and fried plantains. The plantains are the best!

When you normally order sweet fried plantains, you should get at least 5 or 6 pieces, here they short change you and only provide two. Two pieces is not a side dish, that's a plate decoration. The dishes are over priced. A typical Cuban restaurant back in Miami will be at least 25% cheaper. Shame on you Vicente's. The Cuban cuisine is supposed to be a very warm and homey almost sould food (but obviously for Cubans) like experience, and you have turned it into a factory for quick money and no love or TRADITIONAL Cuban styles. Also, the waiters feel like they're pushing you out too sometimes.I get why so many people like this place, it's the only one around that is a Cuban spot, but they have not done a good job at representing my people, their love for the food, and the good vibes that we bring. Pick up your game.Revision 2: I have heard they have changed general managers, I will be visiting them in a few weeks to see if it is any better.

I arrived 20 minutes before her and asked the hostess if I could grab a table outside while I wait. While mulling over the menu I ordered a beer to pass the time and try and decide what I'd eventually get for dinner. After my friend arrived, she really wanted a lemonade and asked the man filling up our water glasses if she could order a drink. He replies \"well, I'm just a bus boy....sorry\". No \"sure, I'll grab your waitress\"...just awkward.For an appetizer we ordered the Albondigas Caseras which are beef and lamb meatballs simmered in spicy tomato cumin sauce sprinkled with sliced roasted almonds. Flavor was decent but the meatballs were dry. For dinner, we ordered the Cuban Style Paella which has lobster, shrimp, calamari, scallops, Spanish sausage, chicken, clams, mussels, vegetables and Spanish saffron rice. Quoted 45 minutes to make and $30 PER PERSON.We see a storm brewing and after getting sprinkled on decided to take it inside. It was fairly busy, but they were able to sit us at a table top by the bar. We sit down and a few minutes later the bartender came out and told us we have to move. Ok.....He directs us to a table a few spots down and we sit. The girl who originally seated us near the bar comes back and asks why we're at the table we're at. Uh, because we got moved? She says we need to move AGAIN, to the table across from us. She and the bartender started arguing in front of us about why we had to move again and it was all kinds of tense. The paella eventually came and the waiter asks if we wanted to take a few pics before he serves it. Yes! The paella looked really good; gorgeous color, decent amount of seafood. When I started to dig in my excitement turned into disappointment. Every single piece of seafood was overcooked. Lobster? Overcooked. Shrimp? Rubber. Mussels? Not even cleaned properly. Also, there was no crust on the rice. You know the slightly crispy bits of rice at the bottom of the paella pan? Got none. I don't know how to explain it, but the rice left an odd aftertaste too. You get a ton of food if splitting for 2 people but $60 for a whole paella, and one that isn't even that good is steep.Half an hour without water or even being asked if I wanted another beer our waitress comes over and asks if we want dessert, to which we say yes. And she's off. 10 minutes later there's no sight of her with the dessert tray to take a gander at. Well, the bartender comes over, fills our water (finally) and too asks if we want dessert. When we told him we already told our waitress we do he's off to go grab the dessert tray for us to look at. My friend goes for the flan, myself the tres leches cake.The flan was good! Tres leches? No. For a cake described as  a\"Latin American moist sponge cake soaked in three types of milk. Topped with fluffy vanilla Meringue\" man it was dry. I ate a little bit and left it in the fridge at home overnight and that seemed to make it more moist. I don't know what kind of meringue they're talking about because it's not, it was an inch thick layer of whipped cream.At the end of the meal, the waitress came by with liquor and little chocolate shot vessels and asks if we'd like one, as she previously described it as a \"digestion aid\". We say sure, and take the grossest shot of liquor that tastes like vodka ever. Little did we know, because it was never mentioned, it was $5 a shot. I thought it was complimentary as at no point was it ever made clear the cost. I've been to restaurants before who do the complimentary after dinner shot, so they do exist!While our waitress was nice, I was in that place for 3 hours, service was really spotty and the food was a let down."}, {"review_id": "ZgT2XbEnb7ZHVazvMEGHgQ", "user_id": "6InyxxWLYI0J9y4342o12Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2017", "text": "I was in Detroit on business when I yelp'd places near me.  Vincente's was highly rated, close and sounded intriguing so I decided to stop in.  Let me say...forget the auto industry.  Detroit needs to advertise this place to put it back on the map.  Everything I tried here was phenomenal.  Vincente's is not fully Cuban however.  I have a friend who is very much into Cuban food and he said this place is kind of a cross between Spanish and Cuban.  I have no issues with that as I am not a purist.  A bunch of things sounded delicious here so I couldn't fully decide.  You'll see by the pictures what I decided on.  The Chorizo and Mushroom dish...I cannot stop thinking about.  It was beyond phenomenal.  If I come back again, I'm having two!

I love the idea of trying a small, variety of dishes so I don't miss out on something. I also love the concept of sharing food with people.It was my first time dining at Vincente's and I'm so glad I finally did! We couldn't have asked for a more perfect night for this kind of food. We got there pretty early in the evening (6/6:30pm), and wanted to sit outside on their patio. There was a wait for that, but nothing crazy - we just stepped next door to the comic book store to kill some time. Eventually we came back to the restaurant, and sat at the bar for a drink, but our table became available which was good.After sitting down, we looked over the menu and decided to share some tapas:* Tapas Vegetariana - mix of zucchini, carrots, portobellos, an other veggies and seasoned so deliciously!* Tortilla Espanol - a staple I have to get at every tapas bar I visit! Spanish omelette with potato, peppers and a delicious sauce on the side* Tamal Cubano - not vegetarian, but my friends ordered this: pork belly and other delicious veggies wrapped in the classic tamale corn husk* Queso de Cabra - goat cheese melted atop tomato slices* Avocado and tomato salad * Platanos Maduros - sweet and savory and such a delicious treat for the endOverall everything was pretty tasty. The best things were the veggies, goat cheese and tortilla. All three were bursting with flavors and actually all of them went well together! Where this place loses marks is the salad and the service. I was heavily disappointed in the avocado salad. It was literally a few greens, some grape tomatoes and random slices of avocado on the perimeter of the plate. It was absolutely nothing delicious and was $14. So not worth the money.They also lose points on service. I understand it being Saturday night and it was the firs really nice night in Detroit, but there was only one server working the patio and clearly she was overwhelmed. Flagging her down for anything was a process, so we had to just ask for everything any time we saw her. But, that's not really her fault, that's the fault of the restaurant not adding another person out there. And lastly, they don't seem to regulate the solicitors who walk by the restaurant. A homeless man from the sidewalk literally came into the patio and was asking every single table to order him food. No one from the staff seemed to notice and/or cared or did anything to ask him to leave. Maybe they can't really help that, but either way, it was mostly just sad and kind of awkward. Other than these things, I don't have a single bad thing to say about this place. While they don't have a ton of vegetarian options like other tapas bars I've been to, and they don't have Patatas Bravass (c'mon!), what they DO offer is great and filling. I will absolutely be back!"}, {"review_id": "hWLPktM-e6Nw30KlYEmkMg", "user_id": "JOa0Qh9hacmeWdv-Wk_onA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "What a great place to spend some time!
