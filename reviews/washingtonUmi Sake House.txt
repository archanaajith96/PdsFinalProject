Even though we were a walk in on a Saturday night with a fairly large group, we were seated within 15 minutes which was awesome since we were very hungry. Might I note that the interior design is exquisite with a wooden vibe to it, which made the dining experience that much more enjoyable. As there were so many delicious options, it took a group some time to decide what we wanted to order. As our rolls began to roll out onto our tables, our mouths were watering. After spending some time documenting on social media the goodness we were about to dive into, we began to grub. I must say, we were not disappointed by anything we ordered.. It was all so delicious! My personal favorite was the Moonraker, it had a slight kick of spice to it. I most definitely would recommend this place for any & all sushi lovers :)"}, {"review_id": "bXa2Y2hYxkrbMGqdv-Ff2g", "user_id": "fgoI6vk9o967j-4zbqM_lw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I used to enjoy coming here in my early 20s for happy hour. While the sushi is pretty good and reasonably priced, our experience was overshadowed by the poor service and mediocre ambience. My husband and I recently made a reservation because we had plans in the area later on and still had to wait 30 min for our table, which ended up being in the middle of the room. We were constantly bumped by servers passing by in a hurry. It was loud and hard to hear each other (we aren't that old). Perhaps our experience was also tainted by the couple at the table next to us with a toddler who was running back in forth in the aisle. This is not a kid friendly restaurant so while I admire them going out to dinner as a family, this behavior was not appropriate. This was not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but it would have been appropriate to ask them to not block the aisle. If you go, I recommend you lower your expectations, go during happy hour with a friend, and find a seat at the bar."}, {"review_id": "-1GeEFRebeBZUnadVpkvWg", "user_id": "s62g7EDUY0RP8uWwaBvFuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Always a favorite to visit during weekends. There can be long waits but I believe it is worth it, coming with 2 people usually gets you in quicker than big groups. Their warm goods such as sashimi are very pleasant and have a cute little tea candle light underneath to keep it warm. Overall lots of choices, just a little too expensive. Definitely only a place to go on occasion. They have awesome deals during happy hours.Umi came very highly recommended by people who live here and of course through Yelp. Given that I was looking for something truly special the other night, I decided to venture out from the city center and give this place a try. Even for a table of one, I needed a reservation so that I could sit at the bar and have the omakase. It was well worth it!Nestled in what I am not learning is the Seattle area, Umi Sake matches the style of cuisine that you would expect. It's upscale, modern and caters to those who are true foodies and are willing to pay a pretty penny. Ambiance is really cool and modern and sushi chefs at the sushi bar are very friendly."}, {"review_id": "7r0z2sSm6kG68KuHHxTSAA", "user_id": "0YEcvhgtpPpE_dmmkRx9rA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Umi Sake House was a refreshing change from my recent sushi experience. Its located in Belltown and has a seemingly unassuming store front. However, when you enter into the restaurant it has a modern vibe and ambience. You are escorted down a hallway to the main dining area that features a full bar and sushi bar. We were seated promptly and made it just in time for the happy hour. Out of our order, the california roll, and sushi sampler A were included in the happy hour. Along with this, we ordered a few things off the happy hour menu: pomegranate limeades, cowboy roll and ultimate dragon roll. The pomegranate limeades were fresh but a bit tart for my taste. The cowboy roll was interesting. It was a deep fried roll with cream cheese on the inside, cucumber, and then spicy crab meat on top. It also was garnished with bacon bits. It came spicy mayo sauce as well. I had never tried a sushi roll that included bacon so that was a pleasant surprise. Although it was not my taste, my boyfriend enjoyed it.I ordered the ultimate dragon roll because I am a big fan of unagi and wanted to try Umi Sake House's version of the dragon roll. The dragon roll was quite impressive. It was your typical dragon roll with a california roll base with unagi on top. But, it came with half an eel on top so it was overflowing onto the plate. This roll was one of the pricier rolls on the menu, at about $25. I wanted to try it since it was my first time being there but I think I'll opt for a cheaper version of it next time.Overall, the ambience and food at Umi Sake House was great. The ingredients were fresh and they used real seafood in rolls that commonly use imitation crab, like california rolls. That upgrade really made a difference when it came to taste. My overall experience was positive and I would recommend this restaurant to others in the area looking for an authentic sushi experience."}, {"review_id": "YFeznCiVU7G94MoLRGQhUA", "user_id": "mRz772a5aMQqq8M2lXLmmw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Seattle is apparently the town of happy hour, according to one happy-go-lucky Lyft driver I had on the way back from this place. Indeed, Umi proves that to be true.In a quest to find a good sushi experience, we stumbled upon Umi Sake House and tried to squeeze in last-minute to their happy hour. The bar is open seating and we were fortunate to grab two spots just half an hour before it closed. Happy hour is apparently the talk of the town, because there were several people waiting for seats both at the bar and in line for the front-of-the-house happy hour seating. We got there at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday and were served promptly. My significant other got a well drink with tequila and pineapple juice, while I tried their plum wine. If you don't like the taste of alcohol very much, I highly suggest getting the plum wine. Not only will you feel pretty classy (or maybe I've just lived in a college town for too long...), you will also be surprised at how sweet and crisp the drink is. Waters were also refilled quickly, a big plus for someone who wants to pace their drinking.The happy hour menu is a little limited but we made do with it. We ordered sushi combos A and C (one with shrimp and one with eel), along with the crispy prawns. Sushi here is on-par with other high-quality restaurants I've been to before; the nigiri samplers were excellent and the tuna is some of the most buttery I've ever had. Five pieces for $9 is an excellent deal. The crispy prawns are a real showstopper. Our bar neighbor was so intrigued by them that she asked us to give her our thoughts as we ate them, and the ultimate consensus was that they were great. Crispy egg noodles cocooning around giant prawns are a fascinating concept, and taste excellent when you have them drizzled in sweet chili sauce.They have a good Yelp cash back deal, but I didn't notice it wasn't applicable on Saturdays. This is a perfect place to enjoy a hip happy hour without going into credit card debt."}, {"review_id": "eZaAYo1-LIKXoIrzmLhyrg", "user_id": "aXuxyyTDs5RGoFrhajPLYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I don't really rate Umi Sake in the top tier of sushi restaurants I've been to, but it sure is a good place to go to if you want quality sushi at a pretty affordable price. Given my only visit here was of a cheaper variety since it was during late night happy hour, I thought that a more comprehensive review would be required if I ever came back here.I've been on a significant omakase kick for a while, and I feel like omakase is the only real way to rate a sushi restaurant against another because you get to see the type of fish available and the quality of the fish. Ended up getting the $60 sushi omakase, which is 16 pieces. I gotta say, I was thoroughly impressed. Not the most rare selection of sushi, but it was extremely fresh, there were some pretty decent fish selections in there (hello toro!), and the price per sushi is really difficult to beat. If I had this type of omakase in SoCal, I'm almost certain that it would've cost at least $80.Service here was pretty good, despite it being super busy in here as usual. Umi Sake is very popular in Seattle and always filled up, so I was pretty impressed that our food came out in a quick and orderly manner.Speaking of the above, if you can get a reservation do it. It's not hard to get one on OpenTable. Don't try to walk in here without one unless you like waiting.Bottom line, I won't ever consider Umi Sake a top sushi restaurant. But it's pretty damn good at what it does. Will be back."}, {"review_id": "d0UK6Yk3vZ8UdLqNChN66w", "user_id": "_0hdXqQMhschXeiWTfgYLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Wows this restaurant is very pretty and quite big as well.

The Dynamite Bake was probably my least favorite of them all. It wasnt anything special.The pricing was a bit on a the expensive side for the amount you get.

A solid sushi place in a decent location (along 1st Ave), with a great selection on the happy hour menu!The biggest gripe I have about this place is their prices - it's nowhere close to the quality of even the nearby Wasabi (just up the street), but you're paying a heck of a lot more for a heck of a lot less (portion size).1) VARIETY/SELECTION: 8/10. It's not the \"most\" selection, but they do have something for everyone - sashimi, kalbi beef ribs, dessert, and sushi rolls.2) FRESHNESS: 9/10. Similar to Wasabi and other sushi places around Belltown, the fish is decently fresh, the kalbi beef ribs are consistently decent (not perfect - sometimes they're burnt), and the rolls are always made to order.3) VALUE FOR MONEY: 6/10. The best example I can give here is that the \"chef's chirashi bowl\" is $30-something, but you get 14 pieces of fish - which means that every piece (keep in mind none of the pieces are that big) is at minimum $2. In general, this place is pricey - $20 for a 8-piece sushi roll.4) SERVICE: 7/10. I've been here enough times that I can say that this place isn't bad if you're there alone or in a two-person group; any bigger, though, and you're going to have some *slow* service.5) CONSISTENCY: 7/10. No experience has ever felt \"great\", but even when it was \"good\", there were times when I didn't get a water refill (empty glass, mind you) for 25 minutes, despite having plates delivered and removed all throughout my time there.I'll come alone (or a small group) for Happy Hour, since that's the only time when you get a reasonable price for food, but other than that, the only thing worth ordering is the sushi rolls when sharing with other people. The primary sushi / sashimi menu choices are not the best, and the chirashi bowl is way too expensive to be worth trying more than once."}, {"review_id": "UWnBmVGjWlvq-R1CmimcPQ", "user_id": "aeqV4LCKZUl8mWPSgTe-CA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Delicious!! We came here on a quick overnight trip to Seattle, and with so many options nearby it was hard to choose only one spot for dinner! That being said, we were not disappointed. Arrived shortly after opening time on a Friday and the bar was already full so we went to the sushi bar. Service was pretty good but the place filled up quick so we could tell our waiter was really busy. Cocktails were good, then we started with the crispy prawns (awesome) and some spicy lobster soup. To me it resembled Tom Kha with a coconut broth. Soooo good!Sushi rolls were great although it was so hard to narrow down to only a few. There are almost too many to choose from!

My rolls always taste \"fishy\" here and the seaweed on the spicy tuna roll was so tough I had to pull it out of my mouth like a 2 year old and onto the plate since I couldn't chew it down.

With their happy hour prices I also don't leave with a completely empty wallet.I've not been for dinner, just happy hour, so I can't say if sitting at the sushi counter ends up giving you a higher quality sashimi or fresh sushi experience, but a few rolls when they come out of the kitchen aren't quite as good as others. The California roll was clearly premade and in the fridge so they could turn them out pretty quickly, and even the sashimi sets came from the kitchen so some of the fish was a little better than others. But for the price, you can't hardly find anything as good.Service is pretty good here, they check in, but we had a few times they missed an item that we ordered. Luckily they are quick to fix it and bring whatever it is as quickly as possible.The cocktails don't always hit the mark, some of them seem way too sweet, but they have a sizable list to choose from.I'd put Umi at about 3.5 instead of a full 4 stars, but I think it deserves better than 3, so decided to round up.
