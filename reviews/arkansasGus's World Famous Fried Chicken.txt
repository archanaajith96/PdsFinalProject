We drove 27 minutes (and invited a friend to dinner) only to be greeted by a locked door during operating hours???? Is this real life? We checked our watches and iPhones, checked the hours on the DOOR, Yelp, and Google, then made the phone call. Through the window, (and behind the locked door and closed sign) we saw about 5 tables being served.So... We're not talking some small, no-name, mom and pop shop in the middle of nowhere here, this is GUS' World Famous Fried Chicken for Pete's sake! [NO OFFENSE INTENDED to the 'small, no-name, mom and pop shops in the middle of nowhere' that keep their posted hours!]Oh, and get this... when we called at 8:12 to inquire (because we just knew we were being punk'd), we were told by staff that they had indeed decided to close early because they were \"not making our sales goal today.\" (She literally uttered those words.)What's the logic in that? They had 3 patrons (that we know of) standing at the door and ready to help with the day's goal in that last hour that they were scheduled to be open. How do you make sales by locking the door, especially when the staff is still on the clock? I don't claim to know the ins and outs of restaurant operations, but isn't that counter-productive? Who's call was that?(Sorry, but inconsistency really gets my goat!)Silver lining: I finally got to try Flying Fish tonight (I've had it bookmarked for some time now) so their loss was FF's gain.Thankfully, it wasn't a total bust as we ended up having a great night... But, DUDE! C'mon."}, {"review_id": "7lJhkvvs3NpgalXL2AOAiw", "user_id": "m-IZMSO_Y-tG9PLJE18Plg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "My favorites fried chicken!

I would say if you want high-quality fried chicken in Little Rock Arkansas you should probably go to this place. It's located in downtown Little Rock right on the Arkansas River.

I work at an office with 100+ people. I am the receptionist they give me a list of what they want to order and I call it in. I called today at 10:27am someone answered the phone and said they don't open until 11am, no big deal thought I could call in it early since it was a large order, she hung up before I could ask if she could just write it down. My issue is with REB, I called back at exactly 11 and placed 8 separate orders, I understand it may have been a little unorganized but it took me less than 5 minutes to correct the orders (while still placing the other orders no time wasted). Since this was our first time ordering from Gus's by recommendation, we were a little unsure on how to sub sides. Reb was frustrated with our order and verbally said \"golly and Jesus\" each time I asked someone to clarify their sides, very rude and loud...AGAIN, this was our first time if we knew how to order I wouldn't have to ask my co-workers to clarify the sides. It took less than 5-6 minutes to place our orders, I thought it was extremely unprofessional and unnecessary for his commentary. Next time our office places an order I will not call it in or add my own order to the list, hope the food is better than the service."}, {"review_id": "BWJ9JpTQA3-Ie2sc5-8UAA", "user_id": "2KquSGfWJt9g0_CoQ1X82A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/2/2017", "text": "BLUF: If you want fried chicken, this is a great place to go.
