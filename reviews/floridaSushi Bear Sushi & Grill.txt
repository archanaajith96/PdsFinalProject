The wifey had their chicken hibachi. The Jax roll was actually really good! It had shrimp tempura inside and shrimp on the outside. I took off the avocado though. But they had a dash of eel sauce on it! Bomb! The volcano roll is a little different. Not the typical artificial crab meat on top, had the 'crispies' and conch on top. Not bad. The wifey had chicken hibachi. It was okay she said. Your typical chicken hibachi. They also gave this tempura'd crab sticks doused in shrimp and eel sauce AND Edamame as free appetizers (like the bread they gave you when you go to Carrabbas, lol). The service was great, Ling and Colleen was the bomb, tentative, and polite. We went for a birthday and they gave the birthday day a sweet candle and gave enough coffee cake for the table. Excellent food and establishment!"}, {"review_id": "8j7Xy6nGqMcEnJinrbddTg", "user_id": "hPKjBGJwvn_MasD3rZyp3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Amazing!!!!!I'm visiting a lot of sushi restaurants, this one is one of the bests!The food is amazing, the service is high leveled,and they brought me a roll on the house!!!I will Definitely come back!!!"}, {"review_id": "vvZeM-cEp9OL795GQ5qrBA", "user_id": "S_wUbRlGbQj5paZh4ZvubQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "We went here last night to celebrate our Anniversary and it was so amazing! Clean, atmosphere was great, cozy and Haylee was our server and she was so personable.  We immediately ordered our Ichiban and kirnin beer with Sake and the immediately bring you included clear soup then they showed up with a roll for free and apparently they give you for dinners little taste samples of an actual Sushi roll (and it was almost full size) and and of course they were so good, we ordered one of them as an appetizer. So for dinner I ordered the Crazy girl roll, Volcano roll, Appetizer was Tuna tataki. My husband ordered Steak and shrimp Hibachi and tempura roll as his appetizer. We then ended our night with something small of fried Oreos which came with 4 so it was small and perfect and they went above and beyond and put HAPPY ANNIVERSARY WITH THE #11 on it to make the presentation even more special ending my night on a A+. We will be back!"}, {"review_id": "TozSlrf4F4UoThRpI6gcFA", "user_id": "CKuRtUfPk9GTTiBygGL6KQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Great place for sushi. It was my 1st time.

Boy were we wrong. We were seated immediately for lunch, and were brought a free sample of a holiday roll. We had 3 servers come by and check on us throughout lunch. We ordered and soups were brought out almost immediately. I got a salmon roll and vegetable tempura. Both were good. I loved the presentation of the roll. About halfway through our lunch the lights dimmed and a happy birthday EDM song played throughout the place. All the servers came out with a piece of cake and a crazy candle contraption that spun. They gave it to the table next to us. It was definitely a unique experience."}, {"review_id": "NhAqtPo4npLHQ3uLFxZ-ag", "user_id": "_kgC4cRgSv8d60oljIrrQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "I've been here several times, but never had a chance to write a good review. Sorry, did I say good review? This sushi place deserves more than \"good.\" It's unique from the rest of the sushi places I've been to. You may ask why is it unique? Besides the superb customer service, this place is the only sushi place in Jax that gives complimentary food! How amazing is that?Sushi Bear Sushi and Grill offers a wide selection of authentic Japanese food, ranging from sushi to vegetable tempura to steak hibachi grill and much more! Located on a small, quiet plaza, this place is worth a visit. People usually spend about 1 hr here. It gets busy during lunch hours (11 AM - 1 PM) and dinner hours (6 PM - 8 PM). Waiting can be around 15 or 20 mins. Parking is spacious, so that's not a problem at all.My experiences? I've been here many times, but never got a chance to see the live music. However, that doesn't mean my visits were not worth it. Long story short, this place is amazing! It has beautiful decorations, great staff and service, clean bathroom, friendly environment and atmosphere, delicious food, etc.. simply just amazing! When you walk in, you are greeted with a friendly smile. Depending how busy it is, you may choose to sit at the booth or table. I always dine in at the booths because the seats are more comfortable. The server takes you to your seat and asks for your drinks. While you are glazing through the menu, the server walks around and asks if you are ready to order or have any questions. This is what a great restaurant must have: attentive and helpful servers. The servers are always checking on their customers, asking if the food is okay or refilling the drinks, etc. Even the owners (husband and wife, family owned business) walk around with a friendly smile. My fiancée and I ordered quite a lot of food. It's because we both love Japanese food, especially their fresh and authentic sushi rolls. After we ordered our food, the server brought complimentary soup and holiday sushi rolls. Simply, \"on the house\" sounds good to me! I believe that if you order a lot of food, you get more \"on the house\" food. Throughout our dining experience, we got from complimentary appetizers to dessert. The food? They were absolutely amazing and delicious! The sushi rolls were perfectly done. Every bite satisfied my taste buds! The tempura were kind of oily, but soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. That's how I like it! The steak and scallops hibachi grill was so flavorful. Long story short, every item on the menu is simply amazing. I cannot ask for more!Overall, I am very sorry that this review is so long. Words cannot express how delighted and blessed I am to have finally found my to-go place for sushi. I live in the Southside and it's a 40 mins drive to this place. I wish that they will open another location in the Southside. Due to the popularity, they will open another one, right? Anyways, this place just deserved an awesome review from me! I will be back for more. Highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "4bEI-nOc-1v7OrolfrYRtg", "user_id": "567xJ442_bKKo5O1mpNagw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Great, great, great sushi place! Between the server's attentiveness, and food quality, it's worth the visit. The rolls I ordered were well made and the rice to avo/fish ratio was spot on. Some places try to skimp on the fish and pack on the rice, not this place. When I ate the roll I could taste the avo and Salmon, not a big bite of rice. The rolls themselves stayed together well and the presentation was pretty, too. The rice was definitely the right texture and seasoned properly. It's all that a sushi place should be in my opinion. Will definitely be back and quite possibly, it may be my go-to sushi place in the area."}, {"review_id": "bg6voLUnCygLOqQaJGyLXw", "user_id": "wzVwv7h1fw-rmgrM8xA-cw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Short wait time.

It's for the all over dining experience here...-Starts with free sake or wine for checking in on Yelp -they shower you with free soup and a tasty small fried sushi roll/ edamame - the rolls were good, I particularly liked the crazy girl...very good, I wasn't sure if the jalapeño on top would be too overpowering or spicy but it wasn't...it was delish- Hibachi ( we got steak) was very good, steak cooked as requested and served with noodles and fried rice- Free small dessert for the tableSo you see the theme...people like free stuff, it makes you feel special and appreciated for coming to their restaurant...Sushi Bear understands this and gets a nice following because of it!  :)"}, {"review_id": "nWhAae43GDIFI5j_R6z48Q", "user_id": "h4POyUnCpNLH45GcD01JVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2017", "text": "Alright y'all, I am a sushi lover, an eater of all things sushi, a sushi bear if you will. This place is so centered around the guest having a great experience, that they have delicious sushi on top of that feels like a bonus. The service here is a team effort, every server/manager is there to meet you every need. They also offer complementary fried crab with eel sauce and shrimp sauce with every meal, and a dessert! The fish is always fresh, and the rolls are a great size, the rice is perfect. I normally get the sweetheart roll, Jax roll and shrimp tempura, you have to roll me out of there, I always leave feeling so stuffed!
