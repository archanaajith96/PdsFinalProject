We started with the bone in Bourbon wings, which were to die for. They were tangy, spicy, and tender. My pear and roasted pecan salad with grilled chicken was good. It met my expectations.The prime rib sandwich was their delicious version of a French dip. The meat was tender and delicious without being too salty. The bread it was served on was crisp. The side of mac and cheese it came with was also a nice addition."}, {"review_id": "JPtGqMhrO1s-NVwtX7BFmg", "user_id": "wRB4ydleVCuCHDS8kIIkNg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "I have been to the Half Barrel many times when I lived in Rochester and it used to be my one of my favorite restaurants. Sadly, I think the quality of the food and service has slowly been declining. On a Saturday evening my husband and I arrived, it wasn't terribly busy and we were seated right away. It took us awhile to get drinks and even water. It took another 15 minutes for us to be able to order food. I ordered the tacos with a yam as a side and my husband went for the burger (ordered medium)and fries. Now I've had their burgers before and they've been perfectly cooked, full of flavor and dripping with juice. Today the burger was bland, dry, and over cooked. The fries were still delicious as always, but our table didn't have ketchup and it took us awhile to get some. The fish tacos were about 80% coleslaw with a little bit of fish pieces. The flavor was good and it packed some heat, but kinda felt like I was just eating coleslaw tacos. The yam I had as a side was the real winner. It came topped with a flavored sour cream and crispy bacon. This literally saved my entire meal and I would get this again and again. It did take us about 45 minutes to finally get our food, and we weren't the only one having problems with service. The table next to us got up and moved entirely and I heard another table asking where their server was because they hadn't seen anybody for awhile. I'm sad that the quality isn't consistent with Half Barrel because I really think they have what it takes to be a 5 star local eat. However, the prices just aren't worth the hit or miss you get with service and quality."}, {"review_id": "APkSrO5amnMRWVxYqWT9MQ", "user_id": "IeRlvi3QWgO1KOqZvYtWTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Came here while visiting and my husband and I sat at the bar and had an awesome bartender Andy. Super friendly and very attentive. My husband got the bbq chicken flatbread and he said it was just ok as it was pretty cheesy greasy. I got the chicken amablu, and it was great! I love their home made S shaped fries as they were a great twist than your usual French fry.I would go back alone for the bartender and fries for sure."}, {"review_id": "cBZ8-C4tN4poEaS6puA-gA", "user_id": "Ln3Un3bRt36JJczUAto5EQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "You wont think great food would come from a bar but you are WRONG!!!!!

It took him about 10 minutes to greet us after casually strolling by several times and obviously seeing us.   Then he brought our drinks, took our order for our appetizers and we didn't see him again until we were done with them. I guess he assumed we didn't care to order entree's. My husband and I both wait tables part time and he missed out on us tipping on more than just a couple appetizers. We went down the street and ordered entrees and spent good money there and had great service. Overall, super disappointing to feel like we aren't as important as his other tables."}, {"review_id": "VsIJD4ArxNHR68Nr18AE8A", "user_id": "ZDo8vZYC_-u1Zi2zrsAyLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/24/2017", "text": "I've been on a string of good eats lately. In Rochester on business with 2 other co workers and decided to try The Half Barrell last night for dinner based on Yelp reviews and the proximity to The Doubletree Hilton, where we are staying through tomorrow.Ambience is what you'd expect from a new american bar establishment...darker tones and more dim lit. Our customer service was excellent - our server was named Adam.We started with an appetizer - pork belly nachos. Delicious. My entree was the 10 oz Iowa cut strip cooked medium rare with gorgonzola butter and a side of the fried mashed potatoes. It was one of the top meals I've had. The cut of steak was mouthwatering.Everything hit the spot - taste, presentation, customer service, and the amount of food. I highly recommend and will be back if back visiting for business. My co workers enjoyed their orders as well."}, {"review_id": "UiGBydw_RzJIuJ0Rtf151A", "user_id": "_cBmV5i-aPc7W_xU4b8uTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Perfect (& dangerous) place for Whiskey Lovers! Large whiskey selection to choose from. If you can't choose, do one (or a couple) of their flights. When I came here, there was no wait (but that was Christmas weekend when DT Rochester was a ghost town). You can make reservations online thru Yelp. Food was amazing! Highly recommend the following:* Cheese Curds : Less breaded (& better) version of mozzarella sticks * Steak & Blue Cheese Penne : Perfect amount of blue cheese, not too overwhelming. Good amount of steak chunks (delicious).Staff was friendly and drinks/food came out fairly quickly."}, {"review_id": "fqTJN0aD471JRk_3lRbAcA", "user_id": "aZPTQYoSrI-sEbOp-_UUAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "This place was Da bomb!!!

While I do not drink whiskey I can appreciate the extensive selection they have. If your a whiskey drinker this looks to be the place to be. They also have a good selection of microbrews and other alcoholic drinks. I tried the Effen A off the beverage menu which was a little too sour a drink for me but the waitress did say it was sour when I asked her about it, so my bad. Next I had a Moscow Mule next which was delightful. We tried the pork nachos which are very flavorful and very filling. For sure a must try.  I ordered the midwest chicken wrap with fries which was also very good. My husband had the barrel burger which he found tasty. Both of us had to take half of our dinner to go because of how full we were from the nachos.Our server was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable.

We had the nachos and a burger. Beautiful plating but flavor and cooking techniques fell flat. Nachos had a full layer of cheese that wasn't melted. Hamburger needed some more umph and seasoning. The grilled onions on the burger were undercooked and still crunchy and a bit sharp. Waitress was pleasant but not the brightest bulb on the tree.  OMG! Make sure to check your bill. They're charging 13% sales tax when the law is 8%!!!! Fortunately the bartender adjusted our bill and called someone about it."}, {"review_id": "GD0IxMuMs0GnsUOXQRxRtg", "user_id": "SPmaZWRB_6RqSifoMw4dsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "The food is pretty good.
