My personal choice and ice cold Diet Coke to wash down the juicy burger.  I got the Seoul Burger and it was very tasty. They also ask you how you want your patty cooked so be ready, I personally chose medium rare. I went on a Tuesday and they have a pickles special so you get a small cup of pickles that comes with your meal. Very yummy and I will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "NPbPW7KUhKDBG9HpoJiSNw", "user_id": "xC03BbSzbstgE1Dt9r1d7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Burger Seoul is a strange concept in a strange spot. It's an artisan food truck alone in a parking lot, next to a dingy convenience store, and it serves spectacular food.We tried the Seoul Burger and the Bulgogiger. Both were great, but between the two, Seoul won out. These are gourmet burgers disguised as fast food -- good balance of unique flavors, large patties, and remarkable structural integrity despite how juicy they are (I don't know how you'd take this to-go; they're JUICY).The guy who runs this place is eccentric, but clearly down-to-earth and loves what he does. I get the feeling people would go here as much for him as for the food. I took off a star because of the location. Because it's in an outdoor parking lot, there isn't much seating, and during the rainy season it's probably not a pleasant place to hang out. The music blaring from the speakers also made ordering difficult. Burger Seoul does not serve drinks, so you have to go into the convenience store which makes this a 2-stop shop. Overall, Burger Seoul is definitely a unique experience worth trying."}, {"review_id": "GDL8s6gUO2sFg1PHs14R5w", "user_id": "84-C18WKfMjcky7RM7js3A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "UPDATE: I've downgraded my star rating from 5 to 3 for shady business practices. A $100 bill is legal tender and you are lawfully required to accept it. I wouldn't have been so upset but then, to add insult to injury,  you added a $1 surcharge if I used my debit card. Outrageous. These burgers are gourmet-level dishes. I've been here a half dozen times and they are consistently incredible. The  buttery garlic fries will hit the spot for those savory cravings that have you roaming the chip isle at Safeway. The burgers are obviously lightly hand packed so they are big and juicy instead of the dry and dense burgers most places sell.Don't let the unassuming food truck located in a mini mart parking lot turn you away.  You are missing out if you die before experiencing this perfect fusion of Korean flavors and the all-American burger."}, {"review_id": "0YT7YkDReLZ4XAfhtefp2A", "user_id": "i709UNX8JTmEqCUyg-Fj8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "4.5It's got Seoul, soooooo~~~ul everywhereee! Not sure if you can tell, but I was craving soul food and Burger Seoul is exactly where I had to come. The best type of food to be chowing on while watching heart-strings-tugging \"PLUS ULTRA\" action!Love: The fries. Soooo crispy and flavorsome! Whether you want it savory or straight up [light] sweet, they bring excellence. Love their thin, sweet, and crunchy Sweet Potato Fries. On those savory-itching days? Seoul Fire Fries all the way. A beautiful mess of their sweet and slightly spicy sauce, smattering of Parmesan cheese, and soft pork meat. One of the most enjoyable fries I have had up to date. Find myself craving them from time to time..The best burger on their menu goes by the name of \"Fire Soul\". Nestled between two sweet [what I suspect to be] brioche buns are layers of tender pork, their delicious sweet and spicy sauce, plain lettuce, and (what I really enjoyed) their take on Korean cucumber kimchi to create a perfect burger; a wonderful testament as to what \"fusion food\" means. As for the Seoul Burger, I found it to be quite bland the first [and last] time I had it. Great quality burger, but nothing which made me say, \"this is the one\". I, clearly, have the title reserved for the Fire Soul. I've also tried the burgers with gluten-free buns... do not do it. The buns are so dry and wheat-y you'll have wasted all that is good and wonderful. Do not do it. Unless you're already accustomed to it, then go ahead. For the sake of those who merely want to taste it out of curiosity, heed my warning.Ample parking and perfect to eat there on a sunny day. Two tables are set beside the truck for those who want to stay in the area. And if you want to eat the burgers at the pinnacle of tastiness, I'd say do it the moment you get your paper bag. The buns will get soggy quickly (within 20 minutes).With food it's always \"PLUS ULTRA\"!! Glad Tacoma has a gem to call its own."}, {"review_id": "NYEeaKhw77ejCqz7-_h0og", "user_id": "QK_XjNZuI3ssvZDh6GlEeQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "First time visit today. I had a training up the street and walked down at the end of the day. (It's a 5 minute walk from the DSHS office on State St.) Very glad I waited until the end of the day! (so messy!)I got there a little before 4. One car waiting before me. Someone from inside the truck yelled they'd be with me in a minute. I'm checking in on Yelp and she's at the window. She scared me. I ordered the Seoul Burger, medium, add cucumber, light sauce. Also ordered the garlic fries. She said 15 minutes. Total was $13 and some change. I didn't see drinks and she didn't offer. So I walked over to the little corner store and bought a diet coke. Wait wasn't quite 15 minutes. About 10.I could smell the garlic fries through the bag on my walk back to my car. They smelled amazing. Yeah they're just seasoned with garlic powder, but garlic is garlic on a well cooked fry! They were so good!OK... What you really wanna hear about... The burger. It was HUGE. I had to unhinge my jaw for the first bite. Flavor of the burger was amazing. Like my dad made it! There was a bit more sauce than I wanted so my bottom bun got a little soft, but it didn't fall apart. The sauce didn't have much flavor to me. Adding the cucumbers (pickles) is a MUST!Ask for extra napkins. I used all TWO very quickly. Thankfully I had a roll of paper towels in my back seat! I recommend this place to any of my fellow carnivores! Skip the fries and get a snack bag of chips and soda from the mini mart.Thanks Jin K. for telling me to just do it!!"}, {"review_id": "OORjQH8pO6wf3oslN6WN7g", "user_id": "4QAG8xYFW407ymlvfcXQYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "The first bite I ever took from a burger Seoul burger I was overwhelmed with so much regret!

I'm just going to admit it, I went to burger Seoul twice in a week!  but I couldn't stop myself from wanting to try another item on their menu! After all I have 5 years of missing out to make up for!! First time I got the Seoul Burger because if they are putting their name on a burger then it must be the best. Even the smell of that delicious burger was to die for. The bread was nice, buttery and soft and the lettuce was so crunchy! The burger was flavorful and paired well with their special sauce, which btw they sell on the side! The second time I had their Bulgogiger; plenty of Korean grilled ribeye with that super crunchy lettuce and Korean pickle. Oh so delicious. The owner is there all the time and he's super friendly.

Since all burgers are packed togo, we took ours to Pt Defiance to enjoy... and they were still warm. There are 2 guys running the truck, so be patient getting your burgers and ordering - they're made fresh and with care, so even though we came at an off hour, it took a few minutes for our burgers to come out.Be warned - their burgers are HUGE, meaty, filling, and messy. They pile A LOT of meat into the burgers and there's a lot going on, making the burgers thick. The bun is more like a brioche bun, so very soft and easy to bite into, but not without potentially getting sauce on your lap. Luckily they do a good job wrapping it, but there was a small puddle of sauce at the bottom of some of my burgers (thank goodness the paper held).Between my family of four we were able to finish 3 burgers w/ some difficulty. We got one of each kind on the menu and ordered a side of sweet potato fries and garlic fries.Bulgoi-er: Definitely recommend for someone not use to Korean spice, as this has the good ol sweet n savory flavors of bulgolgi beef. The meat was good and tender, and the cucumber was a nice refreshing texture.Seoul Burger: I actually felt like this one was the spiciest burger - it has a bit of a kick, but I'm not sure from what. It's an interesting fusion burger... especially when you add the cheddar cheese to their Korean sauce. Yet it works. The burger was thick and juicy. and the veggies made for a nice combination.Fire Soul: This was my favorite... yet despite the name and description, it wasn't actually that spicy? Maybe it had to do with the huge pile of pork slices in the burger... not that I was complaining, but it had great flavor that kinda negated any spiciness. Same with the cucumbers, which made for a good crunch.Sweet Potato Fries: As far as sweet potato fries go, these were really good! Despite their size, each fry was quite crispy and bursting with delicious sweet potato flavor.Garlic Fries: Unlike most garlic fries... these don't have globs of garlic topped. Instead they seem to use a garlic oil to top the fries, giving it a subtle garlic flavor. This makes the fries cleaner to eat, which is funny considering their burgers are hella messy. But I don't think they were that great, even if the fries nicely crisped at its size. The garlic flavor was a little too subtle. Head to Cheney Stadium next time for garlic fries.Overall, great to have a unique burger spot on 19th St Tacoma! Also kudos to these guys for choosing right kind of Heinz ketchup packets, the kind that you have an option of peeling open or tear n squeeze. It's the little things."}, {"review_id": "vTWjpbeodpbLaT1DkDPwMw", "user_id": "pg_foer0w08Rjr3-7OEnSQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/22/2017", "text": "YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!  My pics don't do the food justice.  As you all know I am a HUGE health freak and do not consume red meat, pork, dairy, any type of carbs in the form of bread, pasta, rice, etc.  However.... I was not going to play around with my wacky substitutions when trying Burger Seoul for the first time.  I tried the Bulgogi burger and sweet pot fries, and my hubs had the Fire Seoul with the garlic fries.  SO DAMN GOOD!!!!  The ingredients are fresh, I did not feel sick at all afterward.  The meat on the burgers was immaculate... so much deliciousness!  They do not skimp.  The sauce was delicious, and even the Fire Seoul was flavored to perfection.  I will for sure be coming here again... but here are my two tips for you if you decide to try this Korean goodness...1.  DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT get it to go.  We decided to go home after our anniversary celebration at a couple local breweries because it was getting late and cold and we wanted to be comfy.  While the burger was still amazing, I have a feeling it would be even better right from the truck.  The fries were good, but not that awesome considering they were cold by the time we got home.  Next time I will be dining on location, and YOU SHOULD TOO!2.  If you are in the mood for an all American style burger, this is not your spot.  While we will be coming here again, and again, and again.... if you are not in the mood for this style of burger then you will not be satisfied.  The burgers do have a sweetness to them (which I guess DUH is the marinade...)  We did not try the regular burger, so maybe I am wrong to say this, but both our burgers were on the sweeter side.  So again, unless you're trying the regular burger, this won't be what you're looking for unless you want to try this style of burger.  Either way... you will not be disappointed!  Please give this awesome food truck some business!  What a great addition to the Tacoma food scene :)"}, {"review_id": "RRnEn75AwfCwJ3vvGPfXrQ", "user_id": "s6Fu-qH88pw9_fifg-wknA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "It might not look like much.

Korean cucumbers instead of pickles, spinach, Seoul sauce instead of the usual condiments, and a patty that is juicy, flavorful and just the right thickness.If you're looking for something that is different from anything you've ever had before try the Bulgogiger. It's bulgogi + Burger, and it's AMAZING. Juicy, full of flavor, tender but some crunch. You cannot go wrong with this one. I haven't tried the fire soul as I'm not super tolerant of heat but it sounds good as well.The garlic fries are good too. Perfectly crisp steak fries tender on the inside. Somehow not greasy and just then right amount of garlic flavor. These aren't like stadium garlic fries where the garlic is so pungent and raw but more subtle but still good in their own fashion.If you're in the area definitely stop by and try them out.
