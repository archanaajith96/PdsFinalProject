They take such care in everything they make. Believe me when I say they make EVERYTHING in house. From the ice cream, to the variety of cones (plain, chocolate waffle, vanilla waffle), to the chicken salad wraps, and freshly made soups. There are always lunch specials to choose from. If you have any food allergies or intolerances this is the place for you. There's even a little kiddie corner with books and blocks and such. They have something for everyone"}, {"review_id": "ITysMCeC5EuXymqLPqrnfA", "user_id": "FvXY-tzPWmn2XB-ZIs3Vuw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "I'm so happy to find a delicious local ice cream shop!My friends and I checked out Ellen's on a weekday. The flavors are great and some of them rotate based on the season. And of course, the workers will let you sample the ice cream before you make a decision.OREO ESPRESSO. yum! definitely my favorite and also my first time seeing this flavor. I loved it and I would highly recommend it. I got my ice cream in a cup, but you can choose between the cones and add toppings!There are weekday specials, so check out the sign outside the door or in front of the register. Some days are half off coffee products or 1/2 off of a scoop of a particular flavor.*If you can only have dairy-free ice cream, they don't offer a lot of options. Maybe just 1-2, depending on the day."}, {"review_id": "4nykEbR9ZcxoxSuz41_n9A", "user_id": "AIXFzsxjQTTxZ0AUxvXpxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "This local ice cream shop is located in downtown Charleston. They make their deliciously eclectic flavors in house and offer a wide selection of ice cream, coffee, and lunch/dinner options. Parking is a little tricky when there is something going on downtown. There is street parking and then a parking garage located behind the building. It only costs a dollar if you park for less than an hour. I opted for the chocolate waffle cone with two scoops -- raspberry chocolate chip & espresso Oreo. Both were delicious and the chocolate waffle cone was the best choice! I'm a sucker for a good homemade ice cream spot. And Ellen's did not disappoint. If you are in the area, come by to check them out."}, {"review_id": "LDPJgyZGTSlHsC2pRh07TQ", "user_id": "4FDMtqj1Pyg3kLUzIE0f1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/5/2017", "text": "Long story short, It's good enough, but we've had better. Let me start with a question mark. Why the 5% surcharge for using a credit card for payment? Moving on, the overall experience was positive, and the shop is definitely in the most (and the only) happening part of downtown Charleston, it turns out. Staff were friendly and did a great job of acknowledging us and other customers before they walked up to order, and the space, including the men's restroom, was clean and comfortable.Now the ice cream. There's a local ice cream shop where we live that is quite possibly one of the very best we've been to, so our expectations were high. While the waffle cone was gigantic and my mocha almond was delicious, yet not quite as good as, say banana ice cream at our local shop. The mint chocolate chip ice cream with extra fixings (hot fudge and roasted pecans) was spot on, and the serving size for both was very generous. I'd be happy to stop here again."}, {"review_id": "-3m4xU0Od0vhdzAG3VCJsg", "user_id": "O1n3NH_g5UoscHuihkREjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/30/2017", "text": "Delicious ice cream, great space and greatlocation!  You can eat inside or at one of the outside sidewalk tables.  They have soft serve or traditional ice cream, enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "Crp-Yxs8FCc3YmqMx87dSw", "user_id": "ek1vAUCyu-CQU2sZlbWRpQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "This is a cute little place with a bunch of different flavors and options. I'm a huge fan of hot fudge brownie sundaes, so I opted for that... Honestly, that was probably a bit of a mistake as that doesn't appear to be their forte.  First off it was a tad bit pricey for what's given, and secondly the fudge and brownie weren't warmed. They simple grabbed a brownie out of the counter shelf and put it in a bowl, added a scoop of ice cream and put some chocolate sauce on it (I had the option for nuts and whipped cream, just decided to keep it simple).  And while I could see the brownie being better if it we're warm, the chocolate sauce would still be below average in my opinion. On a positive note, the vanilla bean ice cream was very good and gave me hope that I probably just made a bad selection. I'll definitely try it again, but probably just go with a simple scoop or two of one of their different flavors of ice cream. I'll update my review when I do!"}, {"review_id": "a5zOC1XO9oHyB4ZxJMMHzA", "user_id": "RtfBrYB9LaI7IEeiZgCqCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "I'm an ice cream aficionado and try to taste local ice creams whenever we travel. Ellen's certainly hit the mark. The espresso oreo was flavorful and not full of yucky white part of the oreo and the mocha almond was full of almonds - big bonus!

Huge scoop sizes at reasonable, fair prices for the quality. Some of the flavors I had were better than comparable flavors at famous places like Toscanini's in Boston or Jeni's Splendid ice cream. Recommend getting the ice cream special flavors of the day, because they're likely experimental flavors that don't often appear on a standard ice cream shop menu like the pear thyme sorbet or whiskey vanilla that I had on the days I visited. Friendly quick service too, even when there were long lines. Such a nice ice cream spot in downtown Charleston."}, {"review_id": "4gYF_t4l77qlkuWvzJr7Xg", "user_id": "npD9KeIpB7PX3OwBMxZ3EQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/17/2016", "text": "We were passing through WV on our way to Ohio & I remembered Charleston being a good stopping point as the interstate passes right by the center of town making many options available. We wanted a treat of some sort and being that it was May and the middle of the day, ice cream sounded really good. Using a trusty little app, I found Ellen's and after doing some recon work, I knew we had to try to stop here. It was well worth the stop!One of the flavor specials they had (at the time) was Mexican Chocolate. It had just the right about of spice to make your throat tickle. Scoop that into their housemade cinnamon waffle cone and this girl was in heaven. They are a well known spot in the heart of downtown as their were people of all ages enjoying a cool treat.

This was my first time in Charleston and I was surprised by how few people were out and about. But without fail Ellen's was always full. It's located on the cutest street with other restaurants and bars walking distance. If you're just stopping by its also a short walk to the waterfront to see the Capitol building and the skyline. We ordered chocolate chip strawberry and almond brittle. It was delicious and I really liked that it's made right there, makes it a lot more special and authentic. Ellen's also had coffee, wraps and salads on the menus. Seemed relatively healthy though we only ordered ice cream... So what do I know.
