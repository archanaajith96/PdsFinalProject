Date of Visit: 5/15/17When on the East Coast, I do my best otter impression. Lucky for me, my colleagues were willing to cozy up to the bar at Atlantic Fish and do the same. The cocktails were tasty (try the \"Where's My Bulleit?\" - Bulleit Bourbon, Amaro Nonino Quintessentia, Angostura Bitters) and the apps were as fresh as can be (oysters, Ipswich whole-bellied clams). In true glutton fashion, I went with the Captain's Platter for my main course. Shrimp, scallops, clams and haddock - All fried to perfection and served with hand-cut fries. The vibe was casual, loud, and fun, and the bar staff did a great job of keeping both our plates and glasses full. If you're looking to stuff your face with all the goodies of the sea, Atlantic Fish Company won't disappoint."}, {"review_id": "nxdpdv6GCLOBVGAwCVOZvw", "user_id": "vQztUY9a0VPzuuNeB9-dzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The four stars is mostly for the service.  For the food:Crab artichoke dip - addictive and delicious.  Served in a bread bowl that IKept picking at throughout my entire meal. Seriously a must. Linguini and clams - this dish is a usually a favorite of mine but not at Atlantic Fish.  Unfortunately, just underwhelming and I wish I had tried something else.  Skip it!Goat cheese salad - this dish was a complete surprise. My friend's order that left me with a little entree envy.  The distinctive component is the crusted goat cheese that was fried perfectly and oozed a bit as you cut into it.Cocktails - if you are in to smoked mezcal they have great mezcal mule for you.  I couldn't handle all the smoke and switched to  a basic mule that I also enjoyed. I wish they had more sauvignon blanca to choose from but solid. Dessert - peppermint pie.  Light,refreshing, and just enough chocolate to be decadent and delicious.  Great dessert on a hot day. Now for the best part...the service.  I wish I had our waiters name, he was hospitable, funny, knowledgable and even treated us to a game of trivia. Which, after a very long conference was needed just as much as the cocktails. Atlantic Fish was good and definitely worth a visit, but I am not in a rush to get back with all the other seafood restaurants in the city."}, {"review_id": "-gptwExKuBJLxjxOG0LTyg", "user_id": "tNq35k92WAkSLSqeof03hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "The atmosphere was great. The restaurant has an upscale look and feel but the patrons act and dress casual. It is an enjoyable mix. Most importantly, the seafood was awesome. I ordered a clam chowder bread bowl for my appetizer. The clams were very fresh and the chowder was creamy. In addition, the dish was very unique. The bread bowl came in a glass bowl. As a result, there was chowder inside the bowl and more chowder outside of it that drenched it. I have mixed feelings about it though. The chowder inside was hot. On the other hand, the chowder outside of the bowl was cold because the heat was absorbed by the outside of the bread bowl. The sourdough bread bowl was solid. It was thick and soaked up the chowder well. Nevertheless, I could tear pieces of the bread off a bowl and dip them in the chowder so I am not entirely sold on it being pre-soaked with chowder on the outside. It was still good but I wonder if it could have been better.I have no mixed feelings about the fish and chips I ordered. It was one of the best I have eaten anywhere. The fish was cooked perfectly: smooth, tender, and fell apart in flakes. The fried batter was thick and very crunchy. The fries were fries and nothing special. Even if you do not want fish and chips, I definitely recommend ordering a fish dish. The other seafood dishes coming out to the dining area looked great too.If you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary.

The service was wonderful. The ambience is a little subdued but not too much. Great atmosphere!They have a very extensive by-the-glass wine list. I had a nice Pinot. They also offer 9 ounce and half bottle pours. My husband was happy with the nice selection of craft beers.We started with the bacon-wrapped scallops. These were so tasty and perfectly cooked. The scallops were tender and the bacon crispy. They came with some stone ground mustard.For entrees, my husband had the seared Atlantic salmon. I had a taste and thought it was good ( and I am not a salmon eater). It's more mild than the Alaskan salmon. I had the lobster Diavolo, lobster over linguini with a spicy red sauce. Everything tasted great, but the lobster was a little rubbery."}, {"review_id": "DC-W-3TMhTbw159FdGNMZA", "user_id": "boKyzKPxsc52lXSwrkul_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I had a great dinner at Atlantic Fish Co. The seafood was really fresh and well prepared. I started with the Lobster ravioli (I normally do not order ravioli, but seeing how many times they incorporate this into other dishes, I thought I'll give it a try) which was very delicious. I also had a cup of clam chowder (highly recommend). I had a hard time deciding on so many grid choices but decided on the SF Cioppino. Not only was the seafood fresh, and the broth was delicious, the portion was hugh! I am  big eater for a small frame guy and this is the first time I got super full with this delicious seafood stew.Just a great dining experience.

We started off with a dozen raw oysters, with 3 different types: Seattle, Massachusetts and New York, all fabulous.  I like that they will do a mix, allowing us to try the different varieties.Next course was dinner.  My husband had a 2lb Maine lobster stuffed with crabmeat out of the shell.  It was cooked to perfection.  I had the pan seared scallops, cooked perfectly paired with asparagus and sautéed string beans medley. We ended our dinner with creme brûlée, another one of my husband's favorite.  Definition a must have.  As always, exceptional food and superb service.  The ambience is elegant enough for a business meal, friendly get together or a romantic dinner for two.  I highly suggest making a reservation since they are always busy, even if you dine at 9:00 pm!  Ask for Lenny to be your server...he is fantastic!"}, {"review_id": "1TFVjhkP2S3cT1i65H2HTw", "user_id": "-pwMcNa_RSjmpyDfNc6NAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Being in Boston you've got to have New England Clam Chowder, don't you? Here you'll have the best one with intense creamy savor. Take the one in a loaf, because the bread itself is good too. If you like fresh homemade one with a crust of course. The seafood is fresh. We had Tuna Tartar with avocado which was good. But mostly thanks to fresh tuna. Bit I'd rather have another serving of chowder instead:))"}, {"review_id": "xmpJKAQ5BjYRBb9zQfKVgg", "user_id": "hTzcHtk4-0QJnFUbkKpd5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "We ate here for our early anniversary dinner.The food was pretty good, but I can't give it a 5 Star. When you sit they have a wine sommelier come up to you and ask what kind of wines you like. Ultimately she showed us the most expensive bottles on the menu. Normally we're fine with that, but most were $100+, but when you look on the Vivino wine app or google most are roughly $7-$15 a bottle. Pretty strong mark up.My husband ordered the lobster pasta, and I ordered the steak with side lobster. The lobster pasta was really good, but the lobster in it was a little tough.The steak with asparagus, and lobster on the side was delicious.

Also the oysters were super fresh and clean and served nice and cold. The fried seafood was very good and not greasy but less crispy than how I like.  The crab cakes had really big chunks of crab. The lobster roll was chalk full of pieces of lobster but a little bland, and the bread was nice and toasty.  The fresh sea bass was flaky yet succulent.

I completely went all out on my visit here. It was such a warm night that we asked for a patio seat for dinner. We had to wait almost an hour so I highly recommend making reservations. After waiting we got seated at a perfect table that was facing the street. Our server was so helpful with her recommendations and very patient with all of our first-timer questions. We ordered sangrias and Riesling both of which were delicious. The appetizers were also great-the Brussels sprouts, delicious lobster roll, clam chowder, and crab dip. Already pretty full, I ordered the seafood pasta which was ok. It definitely had a ton of seafood in it, but the sauce could've been more flavorful. My creme brûlée dessert was great. I ate way too much but it was worth it.

I've been here numerous times to treat someone to a nice meal or celebrate an occasion. The service is always attentive and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is buzzing, but not too loud to prevent conversation. The specials always change so there is something new to try each time. The bread here is great! It is warm, soft, and tastes as if it has some butter, so no need to add more on my part.I usually get the clam chowder and lobster ravioli for appetizers, both are top notch. The bacon-wrapped scallops are also delicious!For entrees, I've had the lemon sole a couple of times. While I've never found sole to be an intrinsically delicious fish, having it breaded as well as complementing it with bacon lardons and bacon vinaigrette has made it a staple choice for me.For my most recent visit, I tried the seafood fra diavolo. While it has a hearty amount of seafood, I found the scallops to be a bit tough, the mussels were a bit sandy, and there could have been more spice/heat added."}, {"review_id": "znsydji2VPhwlaIv574llQ", "user_id": "brulF_5mP6lk1uo77wThHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "It was an incredibly relaxing and high end dining experience.
