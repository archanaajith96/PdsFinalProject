I've only eaten there twice since I discovered it two weeks ago (or so) It's fresh, delish, and most of the staff is really nice. The chicken salad, steak special salad and roasted veg sandwich are all delish; oooh, and the caramel cake. One of my favorite things, roasted garlic, is on the \"pickle\" bar which I love. A new favorite for sure. Maybe I'll have lunch there today."}, {"review_id": "m8vdXv97yhvEeYWpr-KY2w", "user_id": "Jxq7VaO7-PLX4n_TUUpEzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "I'd give it three and a half stars if I could due to the declining quality of the pizza. They were better when we first started going, but they've been a bit lacking lately. The best things about this place are the fresh brewed tea (nice and strong, and the sweet tea is sweet without being cloying) and the table of add-ons that you can have with any meal (roasted garlic, yum!).You order at the counter, they deliver to your table. Pizzas, sandwiches, soups. I rather like the spicy shrimp pizza. Everything's a little fast-food-ish, a little processed-tasting, but not badly so. Certainly better food than sit-down places like Applebee's or Chili's (I don't know how those two stay in business, I really don't). My wife recommends the veggie pizza and the cuban sandwich (if they have it, that one seems to come and go).The only problem with this place is consistency. Your dinner is being made by teenaged cooks, and the variation in quality reflects that. It's hit or miss, but only once has it been bad to the point I wish I'd gone elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "SxMfXqFwc0_YTWCJgUB2IA", "user_id": "G-qlJhL2OJb1K3YJJq3o9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "I had a really great experience here!The staff were helpful.They let me exchange a side when I didn't want it anymore, and they always have great coupons!"}, {"review_id": "3pqte3cTEHnC_ADCvunkwg", "user_id": "k2xzbmd7-QaAWuMg__SElw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Ordered chicken salad because my Dad's Widow wanted it.

As soon as you walk in the door, you are greeted with a smile and fast service! All the employees seem happy to work here which is an indication that corporate and management are doing a fantastic job. Now let's talk abut about the food! They have many salad variations and the portions are good for the price. Lately I have been leaning towards the ahi tuna salad, it has nice flavor and there is no need for salad dressing because it's lightly seasoned so why add more salt and calories? For goodness sake it's a salad not a buffet bar- keep it light. However I know majority of people in this city like salad dressing and I have to say they are somewhat made but beware they do contain oil! The mini pizzas are decent for what they offer and I haven't had the sandwiches but I know they use the same meat as they do for the salads so I'm sure they are delicious. But save your carbs for their delicious moist cakes, strawberry is my favorite."}, {"review_id": "vIlyGKgN9ZESpyrs0DVAfQ", "user_id": "KNdG5Q500DYCsb72vQnvFg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/2/2017", "text": "Always fresh, fairly quick. No one beats their Caesar salad. Their croutons are phenomenal. The sweet tea tastes a little strange but isn't terrible. Deducted one star because they are SO overpriced. 3.50 to add chicken to my salad? Absurd. Check to go orders before leaving!

Yes, parking was a wee bit problematic, but luckily for us, someone was just leaving as we were pulling in - or else we would have had to park at Sam's club across the street. They have a lot of parking - it was just THAT busy.  They have a huge menu posted on the wall - but trying to read it through 4 or 5 people who are also reading it - well, my eyes aren't like Superman's x-ray vision. But they had a few take out menus on a table, which solved that problem without me having to be born on Krypton. My hubby had a Newk's Club Sandwich \"Hand-Sliced, smoked ham and oven roasted turkey, thick-cut bacon, Ammerlander Swiss Cheese, Aged cheddar cheese, tomatoes and romaine lettuce. Topped with mayo and made-from scratch honey mustard.\"* And the honey mustard is made every day... and my hubby LOVED it. He said the bread was perfection the meat very meaty (yes, guy words there) and just enough honey mustard and mayo to complete it without the bread becoming soggy.  My hubby loves crispy bread that stands up the sandwich that it contains. And he ate every bite - which is huge for him. He usually only eats 1/2 to 3/4's of a meal. And as for me - well my eyes were bigger than my stomach. I really wanted pizza, but the soup selection was driving me crazy. If we had come Yesterday, on Wednesday, it would have been Lobster and Crab Bisque... oh my... I was wishing I had a time machine! But as it was Thursday, they were offering a Tomato Basil Soup that I just couldn't pass up. And I figured what the hay, I'd get a pizza too, since I really wanted it.  So the Deluxe Artisan Pizza was ordered. It features \"Campioni Pepperoni, mortadella, smoked ham, ripe roma tomatoes, red and yellow bell peppers, steak cut portabella mushrooms, imported katamala olives, artichoke hearts, house-shredded mozzarella and provolone cheese over tomato sauce.\"* By the way, when they said smoked ham, they mean smoked ham steak. NO deli meat here. There were generous cubes of ham - and you could taste the smoked part. Yum! The roma tomatoes were sliced - NOT diced, so it didn't disappear with the flavors. Artichokes were from a jar - but let's face the facts - no one serves fresh artichokes.  The katamala olives were pitted but left whole. I would have preferred them to be sliced. They really wanted to roll off my pizza! I was only able to eat half of the pizza and half of my soup, although if I had a bigger stomach, I would have tried to eat everything right there! But that gives me Leftovers! Next time, My hubby and I will only order one Artisan Pizza and share it. That would have been plenty for us! That is, IF I can talk him into splitting a pizza. I have a feeling he might just get stuck on the Newks Club Sandwhich and never order anything else off the menu! *grin* But that will mean more for me.... Oh, and did I mention how FAST we got our food? It was fresh made for us, and within 10 minutes, Boom. On the table. We were expecting to wait quite a bit longer, as they were packed, but they handled the overflow quite nicely. Kudos to Newks! *Quote directly from the Newk's Menu"}, {"review_id": "45RYEMxqU4bXFGpoNsPoIg", "user_id": "UP8C-H-hSMtrbXzcJ5jidg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2017", "text": "Awesome place. The food was excellent. Really great quality. Environment was good for the kind of place it was. Customer service is the only thing I found wrong.

They smaller, kinda more like a tradition authentic Italian pizza. We picked sausage and pepperoni and it was delicious. One of the best pizzas I've had in awhile! I also got the tomato basil bisk which was also very smooth and delicious. Seasoning was good. My girlfriend got a salad and it was huge. Still a salad nothing fancy.

They were very busy when we went so may have been an off day. The bathroom had toilet paper and paper towels on the floor and smelled of stale urine. There was food on the floor under pretty much all the tables. I was the only one in the group to order a salad and it took the longest in comparison to pizza and sandwiches which seemed odd. The salad tasted good but was not mixed very well. All of the dressing and toppings were clumped together at the bottom. Not a huge problem but it was pretty messy to try to toss such a huge salad at the table. Overall it is a good option over fast food but quicker than a regular sit down restaurant.
