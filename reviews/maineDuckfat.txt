With it's yellow and orange awning, it screams to be known on Middle Street, and their food is known by locals and tourists as something to be desired. When you walk into Duckfat, it certainly has a European vibe, with tables put together in a very tight space. It's always pretty dark inside, but with some modern lighting, it gives it an easy coolness vibe. In the nicer weather, there are also benches placed outside for outdoor eating. I have been to Duckfat on multiple occasions, but I have yet to actually eat at their location. If you plan on going to Duckfat, be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes. Due to their small location and limited seating, this causes wait times to fill up fast, and they do not take reservations. Because of the close proximity and the boisterous atmosphere, I prefer not to eat at the location, because I typically like to relax while out to dinner, however, the take out is where it is at. Just the other night, I wanted myself some poutine and a duckfat shake, so I ordered to go, as I normally do. I was told that it would take about 15 minutes. When I went to go pick up my order, I was able to skip the large amount of people waiting to eat-in, and I left with my food in hand! So, if you are able to get the take out, DO IT, and go eat on the Eastern Prom...or in the comfort of your own home. The food that Duckfat offers varies from sandwiches, poutine, fries, and some charcuterie and other spreads, which again gives it that European vibe. I have only ever had the poutine, which is beyond amazing. With the Duckfat fries...it's definitely a heart-attack waiting to happen, but it is oh, so good. I may not have had their sandwiches, but they do look amazing, and I will be sure to get one on my next visit. Duckfat also provides some milkshake options. I tried the salted caramel duckfat milkshake, and it was an explosion of caramel. Between the duckfat and the salted caramel, the flavors are incredibly elevated to make for a sweet treat. Duckfat is an establishment that is sure to stay and be a staple in the Portland food scene. I just wonder when they might expand their venue to fit their demand, however, it hasn't stopped them just yet."}, {"review_id": "MhVhHL5bxszEQnnHo5QQoA", "user_id": "twa9qBd-0-zlGZbRXek7NA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I've heard so many great things about Duckfat and had never been to Portland before so knew I had to hit this place up before leaving. It did not disappoint! Came with a friend and waited outside 10 minutes before opening time on a Sunday so we were able to get seated right away. The space is small and seating is limited so I recommend coming early or you will most likely have to wait quite awhile as this is a very popular Portland eatery. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I got a blueberry cider to drink - refreshing! Had a hard time deciding what to get to eat because I wanted everything, but went with a small poutine topped with duck confit and a fried egg. Ahhhhhmazing. It's in my top 3 and I've eaten quite a bit of poutine. Definitely on the salty side, but hey, that's what makes my tastebuds dance! I don't quite understand people who like bland, underseasoned foods. Weirdos. I left Duckfat with a very happy belly and can't wait to go back and try some other things. Highly recommend this gem!"}, {"review_id": "c1lM0kTGnp_V9r9N723z2g", "user_id": "ZZeqTlp6L8liPtArB0W--g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Duckfat was our very first stop on our very first trip to Portland, and boy will we make it our first stop on every trip to Portland! Duckfat takes something as simple as French fries and makes them extraordinary by deep frying them in, well, duck fat. We split a large order of the French fries and chose the curry mayo and truffle ketchup as our dipping sauces. Both were tasty choices! The French fries were so crisp and yet so fluffy on the inside. They were perfectly seasoned too. We also had to get an order of the poutine to split. So glad we did! The gravy was so good, and those cheese curds? Out of this world and plentiful. I had heard good things about their milkshakes, so naturally we indulged ourselves. I had the Maine blueberry, and my boyfriend had the original vanilla. Both were so delicious and not too sweet either. I've been dreaming of Duckfat's fries ever since our trip and can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "Xa6KkrmwnpgPe6-KUbAmFA", "user_id": "qC50T_ldJ96wPBNDD6vtEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I get why this place is so popular. Beyond the stellar Yelp reviews that brings all the tourists in, the food is equally excellent. Be prepared to wait. I somehow timed my visit just right and only had to wait about 10 minutes. The pagers work for about a block and a half and highlight a couple other bars and shops in the neighborhood you can visit while you wait. There is one large table for groups of 8, but you'll probably have a shorter wait if you show up solo or just bring a friend. I tried the Belgium fries. If you plan to sample lots of different things, just get a small. The fries are amazing. Honestly I've been to Belgium a couple of times and ate my fair share of fries and the fries at Duckfat were on par with the best fries I had in Brussels. You get your choice of dips. I tried the truffle ketchup. It was good. I also ordered the B.G.T. panini (bacon, goat cheese, and tomato). It was great, and Duckfat was partnered with a charity where if you ordered one of these paninis they would donate a meal to charity. Some of the other menu options I didn't get the chance to try - I was just too full - include milkshakes, doughnut holes, and poutine. There is also a nice list of local craft beers available."}, {"review_id": "-t16D1C2blJKPhE45HzVnQ", "user_id": "YkZarGOu8P9r3ISxya_BIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Came to Maine for the weekend to eat some lobster rolls, but wasn't disappointed to stop by Duckfat. We had to wait about an hour to get seated on a weekend evening, but that was a little shorter than other restaurants nearby. The place is small--there's two tables out in a covered patio area and maybe 10 tables inside. It feels a bit cramped, and I'm not surprised that the wait was so long! We shared some duck fries and brussel sprouts. The duck fries were good and came with your choice of dipping sauces, but it only came with 2 of them and you need to pay if you want to try the other sauces (though regular ketchup is free!). The fries were really good, but I couldn't tell anything special about them being fried in duck fat.  I got the butternut squash soup of the day and the leafy green salad. They both tasted fresh and were really good. Overall, I'd be happy to come hear again, but would probably want to check out the other restaurants in the area if I'm ever back in Maine."}, {"review_id": "BwtkJJM7WF9JBK6hPmkR3g", "user_id": "faIA5RWG--up9PADEa0k9g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "3.5 stars This place specializes in duck fat fries two styles: plain with a specialty sauce or poutine. I ordered the poutine since there are such good reviews for it. They were incredibly salty, and the gravy left a lot of flavor to be desired. The fries were cooked well though and I think I would have enjoyed their regular fries more. We also ordered the meatloaf panini and duck confit panini. The panini bread was terrific in both--super crispy. The duck confit panini lacked flavor, and it was mostly just salty meat. The meatloaf was terrific, I would definitely order this again if I came back. The seating is limited, so it might be hard to get a seat at peak time. At some of their seats, there is a magnetic board with words so you can create some poems. Overall it's a pretty cute place and a solid destination to sit and catch up with some friends."}, {"review_id": "q9JcBGuwLEyYXhKOc1Aqfg", "user_id": "UdR_LY_X02e0hikUdVHK0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I hit this restaurant up the first night my husband and I got into Portland.  The wait was maybe 30 minutes (week night), but it was a beautiful night so I didn't mind hanging out outside while we scoured the menu for the perfect order.  We starting out with the poutine (which our neighbors quickly copied) and they were a great start!  For our main course we shared the slow roasted pulled pork cubano.  I really like that the menu isn't too cumbersome.  Sometimes it's too overwhelming to order and I get an unnecessary feeling that I'm missing out on something.  Everything was so good and I would definitely return during my next stop in Portland!"}, {"review_id": "DPLWmk8oMo8SEyB91T4pNQ", "user_id": "zoQwKvJIgV88r43KDKoEYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Had the small poutine with egg.

Fuck yeah you're going to wait. My friend and I spontaneously walked in Saturday in the early evening around 6. At that point, neither of us had eaten since 10 AM and we were STARVING. We didn't read Yelp reviews because we were too busy salivating over pictures, but unfortunately, we missed the memo saying that 1) they didn't take reservations and 2) the wait was definitely going to be forever long. So we decided to nix it for the night and try again Sunday as soon as they opened up. We were about the 6th or 7th group in line and barely made it in, even when it was pouring outside.Small cozy interior, shared hightops with different parties which wasn't such a big deal to me. Very lovely wait-staff, and everyone is so friendly and helpful if you have questions.We had the small poutine to share, and I ordered the overnight duck confit and my friend had the roasted delicata squash. That poutine was amazinnggggg and if we weren't so full from scarfing down our paninis, we probably would've went up a size. They also have beer and wine for those who'd like to wash down the grease. It's been two weeks since I had Duckfat and I'm still craving.

The restaurant is tiny but on the table buzzers lists the nearby cafes and markets that are within range - huge bonus for a spot not using a text alert service. FOOD: Being from out of town, we opted to split a few mainstay items (poutine, brisket panini, and the \"original\" milkshake) in addition to trying something off their specials menu (duck fat fried brussel sprouts). I'll be honest, I expected more from the poutine as it was very salty. It was decent but I kind of wish we had just tried the Belgian cut fries plain with different sauces. The panini was good but nothing stellar. The milkshake was delicious and definitely easy to split - in fact, I'm not sure how someone can finish an entire one on their own with the amount they give you. The brussel sprouts are what sold me on Duckfat - they may have been the best brussel sprouts I have ever had (and this is coming from someone that makes sure to order them off every menu). They were perfectly roasted with maple bacon, apple, crumbled croutons, and a vinaigrette. Buttery, crispy, deliciously umami - they were fantastic. My husband and I wanted to steal the unfinished serving from the couple next to us who were \"too full\" to finish theirs but we restrained ourselves. SERVICE: Our server accommodated our option to split everything by serving halves of our panini on different platters and giving us two glasses for the milkshake - very sweet! Small gestures like this definitely leave a lasting impact. Everything else was efficient and timely as the restaurant requires quick turnover for its size. Please make the brussel sprouts part of the regular menu! I would totally drive up from Boston just for a bowl of them."}, {"review_id": "UAEJ8TwEDqZNyBgiVMmaqw", "user_id": "Tzoft1rz7DoCZqLqKi0OEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Are you here yet?

If you go and there is a wait, I'm telling your right now that this is WORTH THE WAIT. It has a great beer selection, yummy sandwiches, and you have got to try a milkshake if you go. I was here this past weekend and my fiancé and I opted to go to this place twice in a 24 hour period.

My suggestion is when there is a line, if it's 30+ minutes, take your little buzzer remote and head over to East Ender for a drink at the upstairs bar (pay right away so you can leave whenever) and that way get a buzz on before you get your grub!You may think a place that specializes in fancy fries wouldn't do salads well, but in fact their smoked duck and kale salad is one of my favorite items! As are the paninis if you are looking for something more hearty. Obvious, the fries are not to be missed and I would never skip the truffle ketchup...EVER. I mean if you can't put avocado on something, might as well put truffle on it.This place is always packed and it can be a tight squeeze with a lot of noise so prepare to get cozy with thy neighbor.

Small for how popular their menu is and well worth the wait to be seated. We came in Easter Sunday early afternoon and only had an 8 minute wait. We were sat along the wall counter with other diners. Specials were clearly posted on the wall board as well as table tents for each group. We choose the large fries with several dipping sauces, grilled Brussels sprouts, and brisket panini's.Sherri our waitress was fast and friendly. We ordered our drinks, Miller and a blueberry cider and it was almost like she turned around and back again as she placed them in front of us! Fries and sprouts were up next with the sprouts coming first. These had a delightful pickled taste as well as onion and bacon! My husband who is not a sprouts fan even enjoyed them! We were glad we went with the sauce sampler since the ketchup has been \"trufflized\" and didn't taste the same. Our sandwiches were delightful and filling! We had to take home our left overs. Prices were reasonable and well worth it.

Well, if you go here and don't get the fries then ya goofed hard. They're completely addicting, and I loved the truffle ketchup! I also highly recommend the cubano; the pork was so tender and savory. We weren't a fan of the cauliflower, it seemed to have more raw than roasted pieces, and I hoped for more of a kick from the harissa.

That's the only downside of Duckfat. I mean that hasn't stopped me from coming here dozens of times but it's frustrating each time. While people wait the will be standing on/over you. It's very tight and you might have to share the 1 of 2 tables inside and 2 outside. There is a counter where it's nice to interact with the staff who though very hipster love talking about the local food scene and work very hard with long hours. You can do takeout but those fries have a very short expiration. You gotta eat those babies fast and once you taste them that won't be a problem. So those hot Belgian duckfat fries are just the best appetizer with the dipping sauces. Personally a big fan of the garlic mayo and truffle ketchup. We've also been known to order another fry as soon as they bring your first batch and keep doing that so they are always that fresh. The do seasonal soups which I've been a fan of all of them. They are hearty so I have to choose if I'm doing a sandwich or soup. Favorite soups have included -Pork and Root vegetable soup-chorizo kale-tomato As for the sandwiches the only 2 I get are the -Meatloaf with chutney its to die for-The BGT, bacon*goat cheese*tomatoI've tried the Duck Confit which is to rich for me and the Cubano which is kinda boring compared to the first 2. They make Duckfat fried donuts served with duckfat caramel. Though the caramel is so good still before they use to serve this with churros which were way better then the donuts. I know they are similar but the churros were much better in my opinion. So if you can tolerate waiting outside in the cold for a long time and then dine with people standing on top of you then your golden cause the food is quite special."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/duckfat-portland?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
