There was even an omelet for the vegetarian in the group! Service was fast even though they were busy. The sausage gravy was a tad salty but still delicious. Biscuits were crumbly.Must emphasize again = portions are huge, two meals worth of food per each order. They're obviously feeding Midwesterners lol.Very affordable too. Got 3 meals with a side and two coffees for under $22.00! The important part is - this gem exists in the Quad Cities!! (It's hard to find good food out here that doesn't make your stomach upset.)I would highly recommend this place! Hearty, wholesome, very filling, savory, worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "nBKRUlClqghG6S_ZpSsPmg", "user_id": "fDFDgv61Uoimya2vmRNOZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite places in the Quad Cities to eat.As a practice, I have gravy put on the side anytime it comes with a meal, my grandfather made the best gravy either side of the Mississippi River. I also never eat biscuits and gravy out because I am so picky and I hate being judgmental about it knowing most people will never live up to his standards. They do here. They have redeemed my faith that restraunts can make AMAZING gravy. The biscuits are light and fluffy with plenty of country sausage gravy topped with crunchy bacon.The gravy is a perfect accompaniment to the chicken fried steak, which alone is crispy on the outside but tender and full of flavor on the inside. It is thankfully missing all that tough grissel that I so often find inside my favorite dinner.Not found on the menu but their signature item is a stack of cinimman roll pancakes, ask for them. You will find them to be be sweet, and soft with a small bit of caramelization drizzled with a cream cheese frosting.The staff are the best, drinks are kept full and they are unobtrusive. The dining area is large and inviting.Stop on by for the best experience."}, {"review_id": "daC1Tq68wRIzeWUSzWzwcw", "user_id": "XyThP0tTZiPtsFY1kkxHfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "I cannot express how this pancake house treats its locals. I did hear they are expanding their dinning area.. seeing as there is a line around this location every Sunday I can imagine why. once I waited 30 minutes to be seated on a Sunday! The food is Amazing! Worth the wait.They have new dishes seasonally which I adore. Most of all.. I love everyone that works there. Let me start by sharing a story... A man a bit out of sorts was talking to himself outside in the cold. One of the waitresses asked him to come out of the cold. They gave him a hot plate of food and & sat with him on their lunch break. They go beyond dedication, its love. It's in their hearts and you can taste it in their food. They have incorporated culture into every dish served here. Just like their employees. A must see in the area."}, {"review_id": "3N8M2zxvodxpU-R81OVqMA", "user_id": "pNanfS3gJthwH1V-4cQU-g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "Perfect breakfast spot for those wanting an excellent value for a wide selection of food items. Expect a bit of a wait on weekend mornings, but totally worth it. I really recommend the chorizo recipes, the Mexican Skillet tasted great! I also tried the Chicken-Fried Steak. I really liked the steak, but not a huge fan of the gravy, almost tasted like it had a bit of Valletta Cheese; I just like the original whole milk, flour, and sausage. All in all, great spot for food and especially the cinnamon pancakes!"}, {"review_id": "oERTjKUYjoFmZYw8_jKjmA", "user_id": "eUuAZg180ewAFkf3lMZKGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This place is amazing!    There was a line out the door and had a 20 minute wait.  The food was beyond worth the wait.  We went with a group of 4 and it was all our fist time.  Everything sounded good.  So we tried a variety of items.   The table agreed the best thing we got was the biscuits and gravy.  Followed by the cinnamon roll pancakes (they were a bit sweet for me but the pancakes themselves were good).  The other meals included boarder burrito (awesome chorizo and flavor), western omelette (standard and very good.  The omelet was not runny which can be an issue when you get tomatoes), panini breakfast sandwich, corn beef hash and eggs (it was home made corn beef - not from a can)The food was cooked perfectly, our order was accurate, and service was great.  Whenever in town, this will be my new must go to breakfast place."}, {"review_id": "G89j5TMmUqnVZZ0htJ2JMw", "user_id": "epslSySO6S3nh4rb7kBk7w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "We came here for Breakfast on a Sunday morning. Found out about this place on Yelp of course!The place is located downtown and it's street parking. The place is pretty busy, but we found a place to park.We were seated right away. The hostess tried to sit us at a table with another group who we didn't know. Very awkward. I asked to be moved to a booth.I started off with coffee, the pot said Farmers Bro coffee and was very good. They had French Vanilla creamer which was perfect.I settled on the Mexican Skillet which was excellent. The skillet contained Chorizo, Country Potatoes, two eggs, green peppers, onion, tomatoes, jalapeños, cheese, guacamole, homemade salsa, and sour cream. I added Pico de Gallo. Wow, what a fabulous dish, so many fresh flavors made this a spectacular start to the day. This is a generous dish so I had to take half with me to enjoy later. The ingredients just were so fresh and amazing.The Pancakes were just average for me, nothing special.I would definitely come back for Breakfast if in the area."}, {"review_id": "IF0FR9NfMQagILTP-Z7Ldg", "user_id": "yoado_mxNt4ddoLraJVCow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Ate here yesterday with my partner and son for the umpteenth time. This is the best place for breakfast in the quad cities. Can't beat the food quality, price, and service. We have never had a bad experience even when there is a wait. Our favorites include the Mexican skillet, breakfast burrito, all of the kids meals, and of course the cinnamon roll pancakes. Oh and don't get me started on the coffee- I usually will request a stop at a coffee shop before going out to breakfast so I can drink some good quality bean juice, but not if we are going to QC pancake house. The coffee is delicious and fresh every time.I can't say enough good things about this place- if you haven't been yet you need to go.

Oh.Em.Geee....I am waffling between being depressed that I don't live in the Quad Cities and thankful that I can still fit in my yoga pants, since I would fast become a weekend regular...calorie count, be damned!!I should have shared with my dining companion as the portions are generous. Having opted not to share, I took it as a personal challenge to do the best I could to join the clean plate club. While I failed and membership eluded me on this visit, I'm proud (and ashamed) to report that not one speck of gravy remained on my plate.If you are in the area, you MUST visit. I'd love to try their homemade hash...or one of their giant omelets...or that waffle concoction smothered in strawberries with a tower of whipped cream. But actually, I'd probably order that same meal all over again...at least the gravy...maybe on a burger...or on some fries...Food is fresh, made to order and cooked to perfection. Coffee is rich and brewed well. Uber friendly staff that ensures your coffee and water never hit that half-empty mark.OMG.

Approximately 20-40 min of wait time. I was alway reluctant to wait but today I decided to take the plunge and do it. There was a 45 min wait and I was expecting simply heaven. Pictures of everyone else's food look amazing, the smells were real, and the hunger had taken over me. I had the Koffee Break skillet and normal pancakes. To put it simple, it was just alright. The potatoes tasted like potatoes, but other than that, everything else tasted like the mixture of cheese they had topped it with. I understand that because they were so busy, maybe they had a hard time preparing food of their best quality, but it didn't change the fact that all I tasted was potato and cheese. The redeeming factor was the price for the amount of food you receive and the server had nothing but a smile on the whole time."}, {"review_id": "GanvLnKYnK75gT0o2xyPxg", "user_id": "xWUBi4dDiViizjP24quxlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This was the best breakfast I ever had in the entire QCA.
