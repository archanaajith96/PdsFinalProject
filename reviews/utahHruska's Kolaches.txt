Like legit, I can't think of anything bad. I guess occasionally they sell out of my favorite things but that is a good problem to have. It means that they are doing things right. I would recommend any of the savory breakfast kolaches. I really like the sausage and gravy and anything with egg. The location is fine for getting in and out and taking a fat load of kolaches to work or to friends. This is bar none the best place to get kolaches around."}, {"review_id": "0ZTbYSYgP61g1ecpVWiGeA", "user_id": "qkzh5ldhbGXEDvJhjPfRiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Wow - choices, choices, choices -Everything I ordered here was delicious.

Boy was I missing out! The lines you frequently see out the door in the mornings are worth it. They have such a variety of flavors and they are just so fresh, warm and delicious! I didn't stop to take a picture before gobbling them all up. The raspberry cream kolache tasted like a perfect homemade roll with raspberry jam. The savory flavors full of meat egg and cheese were to die for, way better than any McDonald's type of breakfast sandwich you've ever had. I am sad we are moving and won't be able to return, but this place is a MUST try."}, {"review_id": "1ehiRWOR4qpjvBh_b8cBeg", "user_id": "ZVTg-a_ExBXh6-KysckGGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "This place pretty much lives up to the hype for me. I used to drive by and see lines out the door to get these Kolaches and had no idea why. I finally decided to try them out and I was so glad I did. I am now a regular there. I usually go with the bacon egg and cheese and the raspberry kind. Make sure to get there as early as you can because they stop baking at 9:30am. And then once they sell out you're out of luck. If you've never had a Kolache I'd highly recommend trying it at least once to see what the hype is about."}, {"review_id": "YrusjbbJhpYp4GL4BYwf4A", "user_id": "SUabcGIPsUFWschNhPdZBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Love this place.  Visiting from SoCal, found this place, and loaded up.  Worth waiting in line and for the freshness to come out of the oven.  The pastries are not loaded with sugar, but loaded with flavor."}, {"review_id": "0NS9xoNIwo3-LbpJtvAJAA", "user_id": "V83URnRDwfYjCc8V1RYWEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I feel like I need to update my review here.

But better get here early cuz there have been multiple occasions when they've sold out and even closed early. Based on an average experience, there is typically a line (sometimes out the door) but it moves fast and the wait is a nonissue. Depending on when you get there, there are a lot of flavors to choose from, both sweet and savory. If you show up later, there will be fewer options but that may be a good thing cuz you're either forced to try something new or you don't get overwhelmed by the options and slow up the order time. So really, it's not a big deal either way. My favorites have been the chicken cilantro, sausage egg jalapeno, pulled pork, and any fruit and cream cheese kolaches. They warm it up for you so when you take a bite, it tastes like the perfect breakfast comfort food. The portions are large, one is good for someone with an average stomach size. But I'd recommend ordering at least one savory and one sweet to balance out the flavors, and duh, eat more kolaches!"}, {"review_id": "VUxtUEugMgy2WVw2Wz-XBg", "user_id": "gKTHSD85iTwfZExiO2cctA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "I missed my early morning train, had 15 minutes to kill, and was late, sad, tired, and hungry.

It's an inexpensive delicious breakfast. Even though the lines are often long it moves quickly and it's totally worth it. I get a sausage egg kolache and a raspberry one.

Filling is abundant. Great price. They ran out shortly after I arrived around 11am. Get there early. I've read some reviews about the whole box vs bagging and i think it's a real tension at this place. The gal stopped filling my order and demanded to know if I was having 8 or more. (Box vs Bag) no biggie but she seemed annoyed. I bought 5. Little patience please or just relax.Great product. Customer service could up its game.I loved all the jalapenos! I notice their sausage is very peppered so very hot...which i like but my kids didn't.Very orange flavor of pork carnitas.I'll be back to sample more."}, {"review_id": "WMZ0GWr3tqU2abDAeBybMg", "user_id": "eAYyPwGQ-Am-sOvCHI8Hqw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Okay, this place continues to be a place I regularly return to for a breakfast/brunch pick up.  The food is consistently fresh, made everyday, and very tasty.  I have a preference for their savory selection, the jalapeno egg and bacon is a favorite, but I've also tried some of their other more edgy combos.There is a constant line that usually forms...but don't be concerned, it isn't ever a long wait.  Good weather provides plenty of places to enjoy your Kolaches...but plan on taking them to go in times of bad weather.  The seating indoors is minimal."}, {"review_id": "lrOGcDYkaZOlulV42uqVug", "user_id": "9-pcVBvRxeaMs6rLDOTh-Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "So ive been to Hruska's Kolaches in Sugarhouse and I just have to say I LOVE THAT LOCATION!!! but this Provo location is lacking  cause they're customer service is a 0/10I stopped in this morning to buy half a dozen for work and I asked the girl if I could have a box and she said I had to buy 8 to get a box?? Which I think is ridiculous cause I'm already spending 12 dollars on kolaches to buy the six I was already getting and they wouldn't even let me have a box?? I just don't really understand that logic. Anyways I tell her I need the box cause I work at the hospital down the street and I'm already carrying all kind of equipment for work and a bag would not be convenient and they would all smoosh into one by the time I got there. But she says 8. So we move forward and I buy the 8 because I had to for the box. I ask her opinion on what two I should get since I wasn't really planning on it or needed them. Then she sighs this big long heavy sigh like I'm inconveniencing her (I'm sorry I understand that you probably get asked this a lot. But you also work here as an employee and are the expert to the flavors) But I just didn't feel friendly after this whole interaction and it left me feeling irritated all morning and personally I don't think ill come back to this location on the way to work for my clinic anymore. Also note: buying the 8 kolaches made them overlap in the box and they had to stack a little when the 6 would have given the perfect amount of room for each?? I dont see the logic."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hruskas-kolaches-provo?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
