A lot of the options are build-your-own, and you can select as many toppings as you would like. Tons of options, and everything is super fresh and high-quality! Some of the toppings include fried cauliflower, chickpea salad, hummus, roasted eggplant, seasoned onions, and tabouleh. It's also quick and easy to order, and your food is ready almost instantly. It costs about $6-9 for any of the meals, and the portion sizes are pretty large so you'll definitely be getting a solid meal for the price. I like this place a lot!Tip: Students can get 10% off if you order with the Snackpass app! (or 25% off if it's your first time).

Not only did he pile on the chicken, but then I added the following: cucumber salad, chickpea salad, babaganoush, garlic sauce, roasted cauliflower, pickled cabbage, a stuffed grape leaf and topped with tons of tatziki and their special white sauce on the side.

The lamb kofta is seasoned to perfection and super tender. The chicken shwarma melts in your mouth and they meld perfectly with the soft rice.

Since I haven't had much Mediterranean food, I got every topping; it was great to have so much variety in my bowl. You can even ask for extra of toppings if you favor certain ones. I especially liked the fried cauliflower, pickled turnips, and chickpea salad.The portion here is great and it definitely lasted more than one meal for me.

I think in the past I've had a chicken pita which I liked, so I'd probably stick with that or a salad, if I come back.  They have online ordering, accept Apple pay, and provide a free drink with your Yelp check in, but being in the heart of downtown prevents them from having reliable parking, which could also be a deterrent for getting in and out quickly."}, {"review_id": "oPu9OTk5hMiIe_eu9dgfmA", "user_id": "_yrWWc93xAK1f-WZ2Bvo9w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "Pitaziki is fine food with fine service in an okay restaurant.

Last night was my third time ordering from Pitaziki...I always get the same thing, which is the meat combo. Now, the description of this dish states that it comes with pita. And given the name of the restaurant, I would think they'd be handing out pita like candy to their customers.The first two times I ordered, I got my meat combo, but not a single pita to be seen. For a carb lover such as myself, you can see how this could be problematic. But both of those times, we ordered delivery, so I didn't want to make a fuss about it. The meat combo is delicious, a hefty combo of both chicken and steak schwarma that's delicious and full of flavor, rice, veggies, and hummus. It's easily 2 meals which for $11 is really awesome!Last night, we did pickup for the first time, and I made sure that pita was included with my combo. Got home, stuffed a pita with some meat....and OH MY GOD!!!! It was the best pita I've ever had in my life! So fluffy and flavorful and obviously freshly made...it was an EXPERIENCE!!! So while I'm in mourning for the two times I did not get to have this otherworldly experience, yes, Pitaziki. You have me hooked.
