I've been here twice and tried the Barbacoa burrito, pizza burrito, and pesto sandwich. Out of the three, my favorite was the pesto sandwich; but the most flavorful was definitely the pizza burrito. Although I love this concept of \"meat substitute\", I think Buds can do a little more of adding more seasoning so customers wouldn't have to drench their food in hot sauce. Maybe I'll come back to try something else next time."}, {"review_id": "bPZktGaHTuEtXi_lSHdEkA", "user_id": "h8OE89HziXVT1GU5OcogcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "I've been vegan for a year and a half now. I can honestly say that these were the best sandwiches I have ever laid my taste buds on. My boyfriend and I got the philly cheesteak and the buffalo chicken. They were both 5 star sandwiches, but we preferred the buffalo chicken, rating it above and beyond, where no sandwich has ever gone before. The ranch dressing and the buffalo sauce was out of this world. The chicken was outstanding. I was hesitant to come here at first l thinking, \"I can make a sandwich at home, there's nothing special to a sandwich.\" Boy was I wrong. I cook often, and I have a decent amount of skill, but there's no way I could recreate this. It was heavenly. Even the perfectly toasted bread was to die for. The service was incredible too. The girl helping us was super friendly and sweet! Oh! The price. The price was SO affordable! I feel like they could be charging much more. I would pay $12 for one of those sandwiches, but for both sandwiches it was only $14. I'm blown away. I wish I didn't live in Alaska, I would eat here all the time. I have a feeling that meat eaters would love this place too, how couldn't you?? If I had a real Philly cheesesteak or Buffalo Chicken sandwich, I would be in a heavily sedated food coma afterwards, but this was not the case. I love being vegan."}, {"review_id": "7Of19knyAgjjgt-85lkp-g", "user_id": "q9kJIjVirGNnSYInxf7wkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I said it before and I'll say it again, I LOVE BUDS! I love the staff, the food, and the fact that I get to eat it. :) I'm slowly in the process of trying the whole menu but I'm enjoying the journey! The cookies are amazing and made fresh daily and out of zucchini cookie dough?! It is the same cookie dough they use in the ice cream at Monkey Wrench which rules! The cookies do sell out fast so I always try to go when the first open. Plus, they are hot if you go right when they open and the wait is never long!My two favorite sandwiches are the buffalo and deli classic. The buffalo has the perfect amount of spice and the flavors are incredible! The deli classic tastes so fresh and the turkey tastes so real! I do wish I ordered the deli classic on their french bread because the wheat bread was a little dry when I had it, the sandwich was still delicious. The barbacoa burrito might be my all time favorite which is weird for me to say.. (I live for sandwiches!) It tastes exactly like barbacoa and everything inside the burrito is so tasty! It's always so hard for me to decide between the buffalo and barbacoa burrito everytime I go! I HIGHLY recommend Buds to everyone!"}, {"review_id": "gKDv-bIUO9BeyDgyDwHELg", "user_id": "DIckqqZNAQwL5ySdqWIJyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "Can't believe how busy this small place it.

Visiting from San Diego I wanted to make sure and try this place since it had really good reviews. This place did not disappoint! The food was delicious and fresh! Being someone who is not vegan but is trying to eat more of a plant based diet, this was so good. My husband got the Chicken Pesto sandwich, you really couldn't tell this was not chicken. I have the Barbacoa (jackfruit) this sandwich was so flavorful and the meat really tasted like pulled pork. I was shocked!My only cons were the place is tiny, not a lot of room to sit and eat (we actually went to the park so it was perfect) and the line was long and took forever.Other then that a must try!"}, {"review_id": "R5Epyngk23nwMX67SGs_6g", "user_id": "AiDNUbTTQkDZwTiV56cx_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Absolutely amazing !!

Leave it to a place called Buds: a throwback to the kind of sandwich/sub shop that seemed to mark my father's young adulthood: local ingredients, local idiosyncrasy, local crowd. I love it, just as I loved the Barbacoa: featuring the sleeper star, jackfruit, in addition to some other savory and healthyish ingredients + a heavy dose of chipotle BBQ sauce, fresh guac, and ginger sour cream so good it's palatable for the sour cream haters among us (me). Leaving the Salt Lake City airport for a ski weekend in Park City, I couldn't have been more stoked. Buds was the proverbial chipotle BBQ icing on the cake, and if all goes well, I'll hit it on my way out. Long live the sandwich shop!"}, {"review_id": "UVowHmAKTZIkLSgFyhVhCA", "user_id": "CNoRo7poNnZ92XvLo7JaKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Love me some Buds!!

Anyway my thoughts on each:-the pesto sub: if it's your first time, get this one. it is without a doubt the best sandwich here. I'd recommend extra veggies/fake meat too if you really want to do it right.-the pizza steak: if it's your second time, get this one. so warm and yummy, the marinara sauce and cheese sauce make a bomb combo -the buffalo: if it's your third time, I'd get this one. Not as good as the pesto but still downright delicious. Haven't had a fake meat buffalo sandwich as good as this one.-the cheesesteak: if it's your fourth time, I'd get this one. Not as good as the pesto or the buffalo but the cheese sauce is pretty delicious. Warning: you will feel rather gross after eating this but it's just skip your next meal.-the deli classic: was decent. if you aren't in the mode for a ton of fake meat but just want a little bit, this one might be a good fit for you. I wasn't wowed with this sandwich though, I think Buds has much better sandwiches. -the barbacoa burrito/sandwich: was not a fan. I've had the barbacoa sandwich from even Stevens and I'd recommend that one much more than this one. I have not had the fresh veggie/Mediterranean veggie so can't comment there. But check this place out it's yummy af"}, {"review_id": "QPuPxLKOQAQbFV2XCbc6mw", "user_id": "ZnYUKdeURohXs6HF8Sdnkg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "This place is awesome. Usually you can expect to go broke paying for vegan food but the price is right at Buds. You can get a pretty big sandwich here that is stuffed with vegan protein. The sauces and seasonings used are pretty good.You can also expect to get friendly and quick service here.They have some nice outdoor seating but nothing indoors.

That's how good their sandwiches are!!The barbacoa burrito was phenomenal. Amazing flavor from the BBQ jackfruit/beans and ginger sour cream!! I don't really even like BBQ, but I swear, the flavor is incredible. The reviews don't lie. The tortilla was kind of soggy by the time we got home, but it was wrapped perfectly, so I was able to eat the entire thing without it falling apart or getting messy. I was incredibly full after devouring it, although I initially thought the burrito looked a bit small. I would totally recommend it to anyone interested in trying jackfruit. I've made it myself before, but Bud's does it waaaay better. The buffalo chicken was awesome too! The creamy herb aioli and spicy buffalo sauce made the perfect combination. The cheesesteak was great and stuffed with creamy cashew cheese, peppers, onions and vegan steak. I enjoyed it, but secretly pined for another barbacoa. I did like that the sandwich bread was scooped out and loaded with as much filling as possible. They were huge but entirely contained, easy and relatively clean to eat. I wanted to try their chocolate chip cookies but they were all sold out when we visited. Seriously get there early if you want to try one.Basically, don't skip Bud's.

I had read a lot of people like the barbacoa burrito and it sounded good to me, wow was I wrong. I couldn't even finish it :/ it was not for me. It had jackfruit in it which I guess is a meat substitute that is a fruit?? Not even sure but wrecked my system. The upside is, my wife had the pesto sandwich. And it was utterly delicious. Looks like I just ordered the wrong thing. I might make it back someday and go for that cuz it was good. Also, this place is vegan but they have vegan chicken sandwiches.

Parking at times can be a bit of an issue, as there is not much of it. There's no restrooms or indoor seating, but they do have a communal sitting area, complete with cool red tables and benches right out front. You order at a tiny window on the side of the building, then go around to another tiny window at the front, where you receive your meal. They're always super quick in getting orders out. They're very affordable! With most items on their menu priced around $7. Also the servings are huge.One of the things I love most about Buds is their delicious crunchy vegan sourdough Hoagie rolls, they are so good you could easily eat the rolls on their own. I'm proud to say that in only 4 visits to Buds, I have tried all their sandwich and salad offerings. LOL!  They have mastered the art of turning jack fruit into a pulled pork substitute.  My favorite sandwiches are the Deli Classic and the Cheesesteak.  All their dishes are like an explosion of flavor in your mouth. You would never know they were vegan unless someone told you. I recently took my FIL to Buds, who is an old school European Omnivore, he couldn't tell the difference.  If ordering The Buffalo, beware! It's super spicy! Buds is the perfect place to go for lunch during the week for a quick bite. On the weekends throughout Summer, I usually pick up a couple of sandwiches, chips, soda's and taco salad and enjoy my goodies on the shore, after a great long swim in the beautiful Jordanelle Reservoir. Buds is one of Utah's top vegan eats. They recently opened a new Mexican inspired restaurant called Boltcutter.  I'm dying to check it out!  If it's half as good as Buds, it will be a winner."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/buds-salt-lake-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
