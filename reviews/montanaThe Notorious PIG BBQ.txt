Visited Missoula for the day and stopped into this place for a quick lunch. Probably the best pulled pork I've ever had, especially with the assortment of homemade barbecue sauces. My friend ordered the ribs which were equally as amazing. We split the mac n cheese, potato salad, and beans sides. All were so delicious.

Boyfriend and I stopped on our way through town for a quick lunch. I got the pulled pork sandwich (yum) and he got the burnt ends sandwich. They have different BBQs for the style you like - I'm a KC BBQ sauce kind of person and it was pretty good! You order at the counter inside and then sit down. We sat on their patio outside (dog friendly), and my only complaint was there was barely any circulation on the patio. While it's technically \"open\", it is very enclosed so it was hot and muggy (even more so than it was outside already). We are super fast because the heat and lack of air movement made it unbearable. Some fans should fix that though! Would definitely recommend for a quick lunch!"}, {"review_id": "4ticRX6Cr3J7gqFlpn9TbA", "user_id": "iRJ9r8fXduur7-f-tziaaA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I don't understand the hype.  Sauces aren't great.  Meat is not phenomenal.  And these use STYROfoam :(("}, {"review_id": "f0Q2OL1WdVjWoLgTa1gU7w", "user_id": "KtoPBK1wECLymuFKfI7_ew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "DO NOT miss this place if you are in Missoula.

Did a yelp search for restaurants before we left and saw PIG had great reviews. We put it on our list to visit. OMG PIG! It was the best BBQ I have ever had. When I think of the perfect flavor for a Babyback rib, they got it. It seemed like a brown sugar rub with an awesome BBQ sauce to finish it. We also tried the burnt ends, pulled pork, and brisket. Pulled pork I didn't care for too much. Burnt ends were great. But for me it was all about the ribs and the brisket. Both were the best I have had. I've toured Texas, hit up Big Bob Gibson's in Alabama, but this place was the best. The sides were awesome. Can go wrong with pork rinds, awesome beans, and delicious smoked Gouda Mac and cheese. We went twice in two days and was happy to lay down my money. I always tell my son that if you don't smell the smoke outside, keep going. When we got out of the car we knew it was going to be good. Customer service was awesome. There was no wait for the food. And we had four different staff members stop by to check on us. Can't wait to come up and watch my son play ball and eat great BBQ."}, {"review_id": "YXrwhChCVP_ZXllT_wUxow", "user_id": "CTbZkj7g6vzc-u1NmtBblA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Sadly I have not eaten here yet, but my wife and I deliver Uber Eats as a team.

With a name like Notorious PIG how could you not stop?! We ordered the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches which were the perfect portion for lunch.

I leave very sad. Why sad? I ate all my food and I want more; Not because the portions were inadequate, they weren't, but because I ate everything. I got the half rack of pure joy and a quarter pound of brisket brilliance. For sides I enjoyed the finest baked beans ever made. These beans are proof enough that God wants us to eat pork so it can be paired with these beans. Jack didn't need magic beans to find his fortune, he needed the recipe to these beans.The other side was a fine helping of deviled egg potato salad.  It was good but had the misfortune of being on the same plate as the beans. Even the water was perfectly wet.If you have not been here, get here. If you think there is no reason to go to Missoula you are wrong. The Notorious PIG is reason enough. The staff was delightfully enthusiastic about their food and seemed to enjoy working there. Food, service and glorious baked beans. You can't ask for more. Ok, you can.
