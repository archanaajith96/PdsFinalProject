The Cellar is in the basement with very dim lighting. VERY romantic! It's a small restaurant, I like it, small so it was perfect for me. The tables are a tab bit close it each other, but it's ok. The food is AMAZING good with a mouth full of flavor!!!! OUR WAITER WAS DARREN AND HE WAS AMAZING, GREAT AND KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE MENU AND DRINKS!! They have beer you have never heard of, they will also give you a tour of the restaurant. I mean we REALLY ENJOYED OURSELVES!!!"}, {"review_id": "WK8XOCFLUHkZLxIvUR4uGQ", "user_id": "Wx91MbpHKLnGrY2gEULLMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Excellent food, service, and drinks. I was visiting Charlotte for business and was there for about a week. I literally could not stop thinking about this place, had to go a 2nd time in the same week!When I walked in I was sure I went to the wrong place or wrong address. But the restaurant is downstairs. It feels significantly different down there being a speakeasy, think Prohibition era meets modern cigar lounge feel. I can see this place being a really nice date spot or great for catching up with friends. The menu had many options But some of my favorites were the duck flatbread, tuna tartar and the scallops entrée. I was most impressed with the drink options. I had the smoked butter pecan old fashioned, it was amazing! I also had the bourbon barrel aged quadrupel ale from Three Philosophers and I was dreaming about it the next day, if you like dark beers with bourbon kick this is for you.So onto the service. If the beer or food options mentioned above don't peak your interest I promise you that if you give your server any inkling that you're looking for some guidance they will be more than happy to help you. We actually had the opportunity to go into the Cellar and what I mean by that is their beer fridge that looks not unlike a humidor. Fun fact: that's where their name The Cellar comes from. It houses many beers they have on site.It's not every time that you go to a restaurant and feel like you got the city experience. When in Charlotte visit The Cellar."}, {"review_id": "pMSFL8a1eW9rIOBylejFsg", "user_id": "0KGCdp9W8jz9KJRsABb66g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Speakeasy vibe that falls short in some areas.Walking through an American Pub type restaurant and down some stairs into its basement feels like you might stumble across an underground poker game. It makes for an interesting vibe; arguably something that is largely missing from Uptown. The decor and setting make for a pretty cool experience. Something about it feels very private and intimate even though it will most likely be packed.If you are labeling yourself as a speakeasy-style restaurant you better have outstanding cocktails and The Cellar holds up pretty well in this area. The beer selection is pretty good as well. Food-wise they could certainly do some things better. The grilled octopus was not done very well and tasted a bit off. The waffle cone trio while an interesting idea, failed to really impress. The duck ragu felt like it was just trying a little too hard. The Brussels sprouts are excellent, but those are hard to mess up. After a handful of visits here, I've realized the service can be hit or miss. Some wait staff are fully capable of providing excellent service even though they are clearly slammed, while others only check in every 15-30 minutes. I wish it were more consistent. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND making a reservation well in advance. This isn't the place to roll up to at 7PM asking for a table.All in all, this is a very interesting spot that I would recommend checking out, but after a 3 year span, other restaurants on the surface have surpassed it...3.5/5."}, {"review_id": "brl-Du41xAgBMtFDFvjegg", "user_id": "WOOhS3yC2dEjOkBCTXaLdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Go downstairs, open the sliding door to this underground speakeasy style bar and restaurant. Brick walls, dark wood and darker metal furnishings sit around a lowly lit room. That is the only downside to this place, it's hard to see all the wonderful things they are doing with the food and craft cocktails. Their beer cellar boasts over 500 different brews. We sat at the bar and ordered from tablets that allowed us to star and compare different cocktails, their ingredients, and preparations. Bartenders, with care and flair, pounded ice, lit things on fire, poured flasks, and made phenomenally balanced concoctions. The food was just as good with seared scallops, duck flatbread, and spicy candied bacon. Whether it's just for a drink or a whole meal, just visiting or a regular, you gotta try this place."}, {"review_id": "DsUh9XyNs4SEjibo6dCXEg", "user_id": "kI61eBL0FCX-2OL0QltuhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "This place is really cool!!

If you're trying to go out for vodka waters and Bud Light, this isn't your place. When you walk downstairs and through the sliding door, it doesn't feel like you're in Charlotte anymore. You're transported into a speakeasy-Gatsby type world. The bar program is outstanding. From the carefully crafted drinks (be patient when you order) to their impressive beer cellar (seriously, they have more than 500 options), Bar Manager/Mixologist Ron does such an amazing job. Two of my favorites are the Blackberry Mescal and Where There's Smoke. My last visit here, Ron made me a Smoked Buttered Pecan Old Fashioned. Not only was it delicious, the presentation was incredible (IG-worthy AF). It's important here to trust your server and ask questions. The staff does a great job walking you through menus and offering recommendations. Food-wise I really love the fire roasted shishito peppers (I seriously could eat the entire bowl by myself), candied jalapeno bacon (guys, it's BACON in a brown sugar GLAZE), and ground duck flatbread (delicious flavor combo of house ground duck, sundried tomato, pear, mushroom, balsamic fig reduction). I honestly have never had a bad dish here. Note: some dishes make more sense for sharing than others. The place is not huge, so they only do reservations until 9pm. Otherwise, it's first come, first serve. I'm a big fan of sitting at the bar. Parking, there is a paid lot on the other side of 7th. You also have the parking deck next to Rock Bottom (diagonally across Tryon). Try to look for a spot on the street, it's free after 6pm. Just make sure to pay attention to the metered spots and signage."}, {"review_id": "JY71MePTLIw7FqzRdRljsw", "user_id": "bvuxor346zDAen3poNl9qA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "When you walk in Duckworths, make sure to head downstairs.  I almost thought this restaurant was the Sports Bar.I'd visit again- decent food and fun place!Cool atmosphere.

A hidden gem below Duckworth's Sports Bar. Was apparently an old speakeasy so be sure to inquire about the history and also take a tour of the beer cellar. Very sexy and swanky vibe. Our entire experience was fantastic. The service was excellent! Patrick our server was AMAZING and the manager Shawn even stopped by our table. Tapas style appetizers the brussel sprouts, mac & cheese and hand cut fries were delicious and very rich. Excellent choices for the wine we ordered- impressive wine list in addition to their massive beer selection and craft cocktails. Apparently their stand out entree is their burger and it's no secret as every table had someone who ordered it. I also couldn't help notice the desserts! We didn't get one but from the looks of it the frosted flake French toast was a customer favorite and it smelled delicious!"}, {"review_id": "B0l7r89CWSqSXubYeNclHA", "user_id": "mgX7RiyezBMCTMIhNhUfaw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/10/2017", "text": "Speakeasy meets tapas, can life get any better than this?I've been meaning to try The Cellar for the longest time, but never had the opportunity. I was in the mood to try something new and decided on Cellar, best decision I've made all week! I went with a friend and we decided on a couple of tapas to share. We landed on the tacos, waffle cones and risotto. Everything was amazing! I would suggest that there be more servings with the tacos. Since it's a tapas place, people are usually sharing. Also, the waffle cones (filled with octopus, shrimp and chicken - 3 diff kinds) were incredibly difficult to share. We ended up complete destroying the waffles and didn't think the waffle cones complemented the flavors of the entire dish. I do highly recommend the risotto. It was probably the best risotto I've ever tasted! As far as drinks, I decide on their twist of a Mai tai that had hints coconut essence - absolutely amazing! My friend also loved their drink, and the perfect setting for drinks!Despite a couple of technical items, I truly enjoyed The Cellar and can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "yP2xXQqjP30DOtToJg1KXA", "user_id": "m5Qvg78iNJ1l5OiSJWGM4Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "On a weekender in Charlotte, we made reservations here. It was a small speakeasy themed restaurant, a theme popular in the area, you have to walk into another restaurant (Duckworth's) and down the stairs to get to it. We ordered a charcuterie board, the waffle cones, and a ribeye to share. I usually don't go for red meats, but our waiter raved about how their head chef was making sure each piece came out perfect of their 1800 degree oven. I have to admit the waiter really sold me on it. Our food came out all at once, which was so strange to me. Although we didn't specify when we ordered, I would've expected it to be staged.The charcuterie board was good, not the best, but it's really hard to mess this one up. The waffle cones were supposed to be: 1, 2, 3, but they all had very similar flavors - the fillings were all too sweet. Finally, the ribeye was definitely rare, average, and not worth the money."}, {"review_id": "lFnHiDS-nj0TiVX-1L_x5Q", "user_id": "_7AYj6bUeTHsYQGqkqvpmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "This place was delicious.

Nothing about them were good at all & if it wasn't for my friend eating them because she didn't want to take them back I would have, because they were a complete waste of $16 for 5 oysters at that. But I digress because other then that I had a wonderful evening here.The atmosphere here is very intimate and is perfect for a date night or even a nice ladies night. It's dimly lit and the music is low. I started with the East Village as my drink of choice, if you're a bourbon drinker I would highly suggest it.For food we ordered the caramelized brussels that were cooked to perfection, the ground duck flatbread that was delicious, and the not too pleased with chargrilled oysters.The service was great, the bartender was friendly, offered suggestions, and was very attentive.I will definitely be back to get the Brussels again & to try some other menu items."}, {"review_id": "t2P74sMrXF893e1wYkFdHw", "user_id": "2NKOI38yFcoAWkDEBZDq1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We came for dinner as well and would recommend getting 4-5 shareable plates instead of the main dishes.

Yummy. The waffle cone offerings, the chicken was over cooked, breading dark, too tough. The shrimp was the same.  Overly fried, tough.  Not sure if dirty, old grease or just left in it took long. The tuna was the better if the three. My friends enjoyed the shrimp and grits and the charred brussel sprouts.  Both were delish, according to them.  Their signature cocktails, prohibition style were smooth and flavorful.  I had the margarita and my friends the sazarac."}, {"review_id": "f2SBAibYxwrFR2ZCyQGM4g", "user_id": "KtUALyuLH7VWHJK62-ELCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Food was Fabulous.
