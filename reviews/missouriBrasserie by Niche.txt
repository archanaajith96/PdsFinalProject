Highly recommend.  For the main coarse i received the roasted chicken which was cooked to perfection.  I was extremely impressed and by having the waiter pick my meal was a little unique for me but both of those items i wouldn't have picked had I ordered for myself.  That may be my new policy when going to a new restaurant :)"}, {"review_id": "UNBAFwG6eb_JAFEr9AiimQ", "user_id": "9txO4_yIT_Q_m3yPy4fH1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Very yummy!I had brunch with a friend and ordered the yogurt and granola and it was fresh and delicious!

We went last night to celebrate my sister-in-law's birthday, and we had an exceptional evening. We started with the cheese poufs and homemade cheese and crostini, both of which were magnificent. Meghan and her bestie (Heather) split the French onion soup - they are happy to split an order, and it's sizable enough to share - and Ryan and I split the frisée salad, which I describe as a deconstructed, high brow BLT sandwich with a poached egg atop as the pièce de résistance - just wonderful. Heather and Ryan both had the chicken, which Ryan and I as a rule never order for dinner at a restaurant EXCEPT at Brasserie as it is not-to-be-missed. Meghan had the steak frites, which was topped in the most decadent and delicious of sauces. I had the croque madame with fries, a delight I could eat every day for a month and never tire of it.Our server Corey was outstanding as was his team, and the house manager even came by to say hi to my hubs. If you haven't been to Brasserie, you need to go.

This review is based solely on my brunch experience at Brasserie, but I'm sure to update it soon with a dinner review- I enjoyed it so much!The atmosphere feels like a little Parisian café. For drinks we kept it simple with some mimosas. We joked that there was a drop of orange juice in each one when we first saw them! But really, they were so good; not drowned in orange juice, but the perfect balance!Per our awesome server's recommendation, my husband ordered the French toast. It was crispy on the outside and nice and gooey on the inside. Topped with a lemon curd that perfectly cut the sweetness of the maple syrup, it was gone in just a few minutes.I'm a more savory brunch person, so I ordered the croque madame- basically a grilled ham sandwich with drool-worthy cheese sauce and a fried egg on top. I would order it again and again it was so good! It was served with perfectly crispy fries on the side. Our brunch experience was one of the best I've had in St. Louis! I will definitely be returning to try the dinner menu!"}, {"review_id": "iA-WkxfKGk15THRUvT_u5A", "user_id": "Yj4SpqG0OJxbg8L1Qsrlsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/16/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "It was a dark and stormy night!  No, I'm kidding, but it was really cold.  Where do you go for something hot to warm up your belly on a cold night?  Brasserie by Niche.  We were able to grab the last two seats at the bar and Chris took excellent care of us.  We ordered our drinks and an order of cheesy poofs (known to them as gougeres) and looked over the menu but we both knew what we came for.We decided to share the steak-tar-tar.  I read in the Food Network magazine the this dish will be making a big comeback this year.  Brasserie has always had it on their menu and they do it deliciously.  Just a hint of mustard to make it just right and served with small toasties.  Now what we came in for.  Their French onion soup.  Do you really have to say French when ordering it? It is so cheesy that you just want to dive in it.  And it really warms you up.  No dessert for us tonight.  On a side note, their valet parking has gone up to six ($6.00) dollars instead of three ($3.00).Would I come back here?  Yes and I will be getting dessert (floating island).

Plus they do open table so reservations were easy!We weren't super hungry so skipped appetizers and salads and just went straight for the main dishes. My SIL and I both had the braised beef. The beef was a great texture and flavor. The bacon lardons were a great addition and went well with the carrots and potatoes that accompanied the beef. My brother had the roasted chicken with shitake mushrooms and ate every last little bit. The waiters were very attentive and the place in general is very cute/quaint. So why isn't this a 5 Star review? Small dessert menu. Although we weren't super hungry I did look at my options because I would have totally just had soup or salad in order to have dessert. Nothing sounded really decadent like I was hoping for. And, I was kind of expecting classic French/European eating where it's a fairly long and slow experience but the meal felt kind of rushed. But I get it, we're in America. Would definitely be interested in going back from brunch sometime to try something different."}, {"review_id": "64QvuIiAidSWsjHaZi9aBw", "user_id": "s3U0QDgbVsD_gnmtfTqZgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "This is my favorite STL brunch spot to date.

If I had one thing to tweak, I would add a couple seasonal changes to the menu.

The first few times, I had good experiences with smaller parties of 3-4, but it was always pretty pricey. The last time I went was for my friend's graduation party, and the food took an excessive time to come out to our table, about an hour after we ordered. Of course, we weren't too happy about this, but we had to constantly ask the staff for more water, drinks, and bread during our time. Overall, we ended up staying at the restaurant for at least 3-4 hours. Also, I felt that the food was just average for the pretty high price and the long wait time, so I didn't think it was worth it. I've never tried the brunch, so maybe that would be more my style of food and vibe. Inside: The restaurant is French cuisine, and the interior is a little older more traditional looking, but it's very dark and dim inside. Food: Table bread is very good, but they don't give you that much. It's really good when it's fresh out of the oven. Steak tartare - Great appetizer if you're raw beef and the texture. You can ask for more of the crisps too. Onion soup - Very cheesy classic French onion soup. Always a great flavor, but can be rich and heavy as a starter. Fromage - I would pass on this. The selection isn't that great, especially if you're not the biggest fan of bleu cheese. The table bread is much better than the one they give you on the cheese plate. Trout - Probably one of the best main dishes I've had here, but the portion is smaller since it's just a fish and a side of cauliflower. The dish has a great brown butter and lemon flavor that is fresh and not too heavy. Braised beef - Not a huge fan of this dish because I think it's not worth it. I think it's pretty simple and easy to imitate some braised beef over mashed potatoes. Roasted chicken - This chicken is a big portion, well-seasoned, very tender, and good potatoes as well. It's basically like half a chicken. Classic profiteroles - Definitely a great dessert to end the meal!"}, {"review_id": "IcFGhImxSjhtEaniD3y-dw", "user_id": "EM8iHjBNJ5aF2xnNcIF8Kg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "This is an excellent restaurant.

Maybe the world. I normally like to customize my burger, but trust me, don't. For instance I don't like raw onion, so I omit it on virtually everything. But please, DON'T! You wouldn't change the Mona Lisa, so please don't change this burger. Just speak the words to your friendly wait staff \"I'll have the double\" and smile. The onion on this burger isn't raw but its not cooked either. Its perfect and if you find yourself thinking I'd rather not have it on there it's easy to take off. Same with the pickle, they're wonderful and are the perfect bit of crunch to the tender juicy meat and soft warm bun.     Service is generally exceptional. This is a great date night place. Awesome for lunch, happy hour and dinner too. I've taken virtually everyone I work with here. At least 15 people. Everyone agrees the food is great. Many have brought their wives back for dinner. The report is always \"The wife loves it!\". I've had a variety of items off their menu, Hanger Steak to the French Dip & French Onion soup it's all great.  Their side carrots on my first visit were some kind of amazing, large cuts of hearty carrot perfectly cooked (perhaps sousvide?). Not crunchy not mushy. Maybe the best carrots I've ever had. On other visits the carrots haven't been nearly as good. Brasserie does suffer a bit in the consistency department. But even on an off day the food is still better than most places.

The lights make for a really relaxing environment perfect for great conversation. I started off with my favorite, the Sazerac. The pour was quite generous and always the perfect way to start an evening. Small, hard biscuits with butter were handed out as though they may break the bank if a small basket of them were placed on the table. I was a little peeved at first but after working so hard to break the little nugget open I decided 1 was enough. Yes, it's not your regular crusty style French bread, it's just rather crusty. Moving on. I ordered the prix fixe menu and started with the chilled tomato soup. It was tasty, not sure why they didn't call it gazspacho but whatever. Then came my braised beef with mashed potatoes and bacon lardons. This was a solid dish, I wish it had more of an alcohol flavor to it. It was filling though and I would eat it again. I finished the meal with the floating island dessert. I wasn't sure what it was but I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't overly sweet and finished the meal on a light note.

The soup was creamier than I thought it would be, as their soup doesn't seem to be beef broth based. Nonetheless, still fantastic! The sandwich was so tasty I should've gotten just that!!
