The menu is limited, but what they serve is very, very good.  Whole and half grilled chicken, also chicken wings, served with tortillas, Mexican beans (with hot dog slices floating in the beans - I'm not kidding!), rice, salsa, and a baggie of onions.  The salsa is very fresh, almost too fresh, particularly during the season when the tomatoes are more whitish pink rather than red - maybe they should rethink the salsa recipe during this time of year.  I was also impressed with the high-quality paper napkins on the tables, they aren't the super cheap variety that most fast food restaurants offer that require a new napkin each time you wipe your mouth or hands.The atmosphere is very informal, fast food style, with as many tables as they can cram into their small dining room.  However, the lack of a multi-million dollar facility doesn't deter many people from visiting, as the restaurant is virtually always completely full of happy and satisfied customers. Just to be clear, the grilled chicken is beyond fantastic.  It's juicy, it's smoky and tender, and it has those wonderful grill marks that say - this chicken was cooked the way chicken was meant to be cooked.  I know people say things like \"best chicken I ever ate\" and they don't really mean it, but I truly don't think I've ever had chicken that is a close second to this."}, {"review_id": "ONWXBms_p6H86uZiTb8aAA", "user_id": "Qo1ybvErH2XgvOJSwvylVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "A Chicken restaurant that is rated this well was something that I had to see. It's not rated because of the dining room atmosphere or customer service but simply because the chicken is that good and The wings are amazing too. And they all come with tortillas!! Keep in mind it is only chicken. Chicken wings, half chicken, or whole chicken. And be patient. It takes at least 20 minutes to get your order because nothing is premade. They wouldn't have great ratings if the chicken sat there all day on the grill. Anyone trying to eat healthy and enjoys chicken should definitely stop here. I always find it hard to eat chicken but isn't dry and actually is enjoyable. Highly recommend everybody trying this place once."}, {"review_id": "ODIZ_MJji-oJz5qHbHnRdw", "user_id": "r5b2VV4jJRw-tI6ulglxOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Simple goodness. Two words that sum up pollo rey. I remember wanting to try this restaurant out after seeing it across the street from a taco place. The smell was so mesmerizing so I was excited to finally try it on a Friday afternoon. The eating space inside is quite small, but tables seemed to move fast. Their menu is not big at all; there were fewer than 10 items but don't let that deceive you. The kitchen has a huge griller essentially with endless amounts of chicken on it being cooked and smoked by wood fired grilled. The result? A perfectly smoked, juicy chicken. This place is a body builders dream. They serve the chicken with rice and various salsas, as well as corn tortillas made in house. Such a simple concept, but executed perfectly! There can be a long wait during peak hours, so beware!"}, {"review_id": "mpJtd-4nMmRRH4jCQH91-A", "user_id": "FpovxC9QBamvpwKcovvgpQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "El Pollo Rey lives up to the hype! I finally made it here for lunch last week on a sunny afternoon and was not let down.  Now, this is not a fancy establishment, you walk in, take in the wonderful aroma of generously seasoned chicken, and as you make your way to the front of the line decide what you want to order. Your choices are whole chicken, half chicken, or wings. Unless you are literally starving I'd go with a half chicken or just wings as it will be plenty of food! All are served with corn tortillas, beans, rice, and salsa. The sides are somewhat forgettable but the chicken is divine."}, {"review_id": "OTN-fgaoWNvDcNm4YrrZVA", "user_id": "62t-bPD25lY--mLXaLQslw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "El Pollo Rey is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant that will make you anything you like, as long as it's smoked chicken. And boy do they do it well. For under $7, you get half a chicken, rice, beans, salsa, and five tortillas--enough to fill just about anyone and leave you totally satisfied. The chicken was juicy, the skin crisp and flavorful, and the sides made for some delicious chicken tacos. For the soda drinkers out there, they also have plenty of Mexican coke and sodas (made with real sugar, for when American corn syrup doesn't cut it). To keep this review short and sweet, El Pollo Rey serves some of the best chicken I've had, and I can't wait to go back. I'd definitely recommend stopping by!"}, {"review_id": "HkUVTNKnIlWSwBi95Wxdfw", "user_id": "g8MCxIxRwls-Zbvilp9e2Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "The food was pretty good. But the service was not. We ordered a half chicken & they said it was going to be 30-40 min wait. It's a Saturday so we understood. However, they started giving people who came in after us their food first & they ordered more food than we did. How does that make any sense? We even bought other things like a soda & cones. Shit still took over 30 mins. Not a cool time. I hope it doesn't happen again or else I'm not going back."}, {"review_id": "ghBKQ0OAlMHZ17oy5_Qc1Q", "user_id": "DgZ-_dpdjpJBjCwVdxmLFA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Finally made my way down to El Pollo Rey. We were greeted by a friendly staff, and very good prices. 4 to 5 stars for both of those aspects. We went with a half chicken and an order of wings. Our order was up in no time and I was ready to devour that chicken.It's a definite deal with the amount of food you get. The chicken came with plenty of tortillas, beans, rice, salsa, and pickled red onions. The wood smoke flavor really comes through in the chicken. My dark meat portions were really good, but the white meat was dry unfortunately. The buffalo wings were cooked well, but there was too much vinegar in the sauce for my liking.The sides were okay. The beans were pretty good, but I could do without the sliced hot dog. The rice was cooked fine, although it was rather bland. I liked the heat level of the salsa, but the color was a bit off putting. I think they used red tomatoes and tomatillos in it. The pickled red onions were good. I think they'd be better served on the side versus coming in a plastic baggie though.A good deal to be had here, and a popular spot. I'll make my way down again at some point."}, {"review_id": "dIcmALrY-4U-RuTHbd2u7A", "user_id": "f53hGdzhiyssIPu5deLgeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "So I'm in Kansas City, KS for a couple hours and I catch an uber to the nearest restaurant which honestly looked like a beat up cardboard box. Then my uber driver suggested he drops me off at better place down the street. I agreed and that was probably the best decision I've made all day. El Pollo Rey seems to be in a low income neighborhood, VERY hole in the Wallish. I go in and got hit with the amazing smell of the fire burning grill!!! I noticed a dozen customers seated and 20 chickens on the grill so I knew it was going to be a decent meal. I ordered the half chicken meal. It came with 5 tortillas, rice, beans and pickled onions. ALL FOR $6.99!!! What a beautiful deal. I wasted no time savagely eating the chicken and rice. It was smoky and juicy. Great seasoning and flavor. OVERALL GREAT FOOD.

The 1st 3 attempts were met with disappointment due to being out of chicken for the day or an hour wait for the next available. Don't even think about ordering something different than their popular chicken because there isn't anything else. Whole chicken, 1/2 chicken or 8 wings; that's the menu - period.The chicken is grilled behind the counter in large quantities, but you can smell the aroma several blocks down Kansas Ave.Three of us shared a whole chicken and 8 wings - plenty of food. It comes with small cups of soupy beans, Mexican rice, pickled onions, a strange hot pasty salsa and tortillas. Put a spoon of each over some chicken and what a great smoky chicken taco you have created!Even better were the wings. They look and taste like a buffalo style wing, but the heat was non existent. Three of us left happy and eager to return."}, {"review_id": "ff-nX54wbUdiM0TKQxfXPw", "user_id": "1HOj4u0NUIsRTBy3Iv7cLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Was wanting to break out of my rut and had planned to try a fried chicken joint when a friend recommended El Pollo Rey.  I remember reading good reviews and, after I checked Yelp, plugged in the address.  My husband and I went around 2:00P so it wasn't crowded.  I took one reviewer's advice and just got the whole chicken because I was SURE the two of us couldn't eat all of it.  Well...there was a little bit left!  Yes, juicy, smokey with crispy grilled skin.  The tortillas were great and I made every bite a little soft shell chicken taco with the salsa and onions.  The weather was nice so we ate outside on the small patio.  I was glad we had some wet wipes in the car because it is hands on eatin!  We plan to go back very soon!"}, {"review_id": "wKyqLe4Wwq3pTP4nqAHZRQ", "user_id": "xbUZL2zG7OCMPqKmPTkuOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2017", "text": "I walked in thinking El Polo Rey had tacos, then I realized it was chicken.

The chicken is grilled, and on the grill it is full of chicken. I mean this is all they have. And it's grilled, like outside grill. It was possibly the best chicken I have eaten in Kansas City.  It's a huge serving, too.I took home half of the half and my son ate it. The rice is basic rice you get everywhere,and I didn't eat the beans. There's plenty of tables. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to make burritos, which I did.  There really isn't much else to El Polo Rey's, but I liked it.  The chicken, if you're in the area, get some.

They take that chicken, throw it on the grill, char the overloving goodness out of it and... I like it.The chicken is joined by a full supporting cast including a small container of beans, one of rice, a plastic bag of onions and a small amount of tortillas. While you'll get a good amount of chicken, either a whole or a half depending on what you order, I wish there was a lot more of everything else. The beans and rice aren't much by themselves, but they're pretty good when you combine them in a small taco.The prices are good too. Even with a whole chicken, which will feed a few, you won't spend more than $15.Beware, the space is small and it will get busy during peak times.EDIT: Holy smokes, the wings are really good. Pun intended. Decent sized, tender and tasty. I'm not sure exactly what they toss them in, some sort of hot sauce, but it's great. They're served as an order of eight for $6.95. Add in a bottle of Coke and you're just under $10.
