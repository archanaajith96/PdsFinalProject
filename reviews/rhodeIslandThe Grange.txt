The food is very creative and they usually have specials. Its's fresh, unique and you can get comfort food, or healthy. They always have options for both.Non-vegetarians should not be afraid there! I've taken more than one meat-eater there who didn't even realize until afterwards that the place is vegetarian, because their menu is so good. Very cool, hip vibe.The only flaw is that the service is usually mediocre, or bad. I find that the service at the bar is way worse than if you have a seat.

I find sometimes we may have one bad experience, but that shouldn't hold us back from trying it again. Things change and people change. We were at an event last night and wanted dessert before we went home. We popped in for some dessert. Nice small late night crowd, nothing crazy so it was nice, relaxing and on the quiet side.This would have been 5 stars if it wasn't for the host this time. We walked in and she just stared at us. Didn't say anything so I said \"can we just sit at the bar then\" and she goes \"fine\". Goes behind the bar and hands us menus and then proceeds to hang out at the bar and not the host stand.The bartender Shannon saved the day. The Grange is very lucky to have her as a bartender. She is so intricate and precise while mixing up her cocktails. Made great recommendations on dessert and assured me everything was vegan. She had sometime to chat with us in between working. I was so surprised this was her first bartending job, coming from living in Vegas myself she would do amazing out there. She had great tattoos too and shared her artist with us which we both appreciated.The cocktail she made was amazing, it had simple syrup, citadelle gin, lemon and blackberries. She even explained the 5 flavor profiles in the simple syrup. She's that knowledgeable. Thank you Shannon for saving the night and making it totally enjoyable for us after a really long day."}, {"review_id": "4YlfBoQuQxqN0Xv5PZcV7w", "user_id": "MUwqO0xhkN6mdGVLwQJ-3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "FINALLY made it to The Grange for dinner!  It lived up to every wonderful review I had heard or read!  I had the roasted cauliflower and the daily greens.  My dining companion also had the cauliflower and the tacos.  Everything was incredible!  Sadly, we were too full for dessert so I'll have to go back again!  May also be back this weekend for brunch!"}, {"review_id": "DO08oD_nCp1iA4Iwa_cFqw", "user_id": "4Lbd6smqMhlrJl7bl3JDcA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "The interior is stunning... beautifully decorated. Had a wonderful experience here. However, I was unaware that the dinner menu doesn't start until 5pm. We got there at 4 and could only order off the bar menu. We were slightly nervous that the food wasn't going to be good/filling. By the end, I was so full I couldn't move. Everything I ordered was made to perfection. All the appetizers sounded tasty, but we chose the hush puppies. You have to try their hush puppies! Nicely fried and comes with maple butter (vegan). I loved that they used a pretzel bun on their black eye pea burger. Their dessert menu didn't really appeal to me, so I kept it simple with ice cream. There are a lot of flavors you can choose from. It seems like most of the menu is vegan or can be made vegan. Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Service was fast (which seems to be a problem here on yelp). Keep in mind we were here before the dinner rush."}, {"review_id": "7vWWMUG31--czchF5Eja3w", "user_id": "5DV1MVjCTvh_IhWnS_x_gw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I love coming to The Grange for brunch!

Although the menu is small, there is a surprising range of plant-based options. We haven't had the chance to try their dinner offering, but if it's anything like their brunch? I'm all about it. Fresh, light, creative -- the food truly is satisfying, though I wish the portions were a bit larger.Space is laid back. A mix of rustic and stylish, you can hang out on one of their porch swings or sofas as you wait to be seated OR if you want to simply people watch, that works too. Personally, I appreciate the old tables and mismatched wooden chairs -- comfortable and familiar, it made me feel right at home. Great for anyone who's looking to try new (vegetarian-friendly) things and enjoys eating fresh and clean!  With offerings like local music during the week, a café on premise, nightly dinner, and an awesome brunch -- there's little wonder why locals and out-of-towners flock to The Grange."}, {"review_id": "CdiT5zs-OIv9Lh6wn8OXqQ", "user_id": "RQBGeJ1Nwdcpe7n3gZ0GrA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "This place is overhyped for what it is, which is that they try to sell you on an \"experience\" (quote unquote from the hostess) so you won't mind long wait times, poor service, and okay food. We were told they both do and don't take reservations (so which is it??), then finally got a reservation for 45 minutes, then were told we couldn't be seated without our whole party even though the last person was just parking outside. I was under the impression this is a vegan-friendly place, but our waitress seemed annoyed/confused about me wanting the vegan reuben option. Even when it was delivered to the table, there was no confirmation of it being vegan or if the coleslaw on the side was vegan. It's a shame because the sandwich itself was really good (and did end up being correctly vegan). Be prepared to wait at least 30 mins for any food to get to your table, though. We didn't have anything complicated and it took forever and there's no bread or appetizer to help you wait. The rest of my party was unimpressed with their grilled cheeses, Thai soup, and eggs. They were good, but nothing worth getting again. And since we weren't offered dessert, I'm guessing it's only available at dinner?? Guess I'll never know. Sad this was such a bust. Glad I got to try, but won't be back."}, {"review_id": "dCi8O-u73kbysGT54KT65Q", "user_id": "ODin7M3ej6blhhAVBMyfbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "We had absolutely no idea that this was a vegetarian/vegan restaurant when we picked it based off of the Yelp pictures when looking for a place to feed three hungry kids after a b-day party on a Sunday. We walked in a little before they shifted to the dinner menu, around 3 o'clock. After reviewing the menu we realized it was a vegetarian menu but everything just sounded amazing we were not about to leave. The wife ordered the General Tso's taco (vegetarian), I ordered an amazing caesar salad, the kids had a smoothie, french fries, and some amazing orange cream soda. The soda was fresh and made in house and was not too sweet but perfect.

However, I must say I enjoyed my food and dining experience there for brunch. I started with the pimento cheese biscuit, which was flavorful. I was expecting something similar to the Red Lobster biscuit, but it was a biscuit with loads of cheese. I also had an ice latte, that was really refreshing but strong. For my main course, I had Chicken Fried Seitan with waffles. It was my first time having seitan, the texture was interesting (kinda spongy) and it was seasoned well. The spicy maple syrup brought the fried seitan and waffles together for a sweet and savory flavor. My friend had the avocado toast, which she enjoyed."}, {"review_id": "AiMrlwNb38dWqo1uc8MsAQ", "user_id": "8BKItWeDz6cbEiYgSaxmXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "This place is a breath of fresh air while adapting to a plant based diet over the past 6 months. Frequenting this place is a no brainer.  From brunch to dinner options, I haven't yet not thoroughly enjoyed something I've tried here. They also have quite a delicious selection of alcoholic beverages of which I recommend the local anesthetic or the bramble on. For brunch, the benedict was so delicious that I couldn't stop eating even though I was completely stuffed. Its also super awesome that I can still enjoy other brunch items that I thought I would miss out on forever such as \"chicken\" and waffles or biscuits and gravy. They are just as delicious as the versions you'd enjoy regularly. For lunch or dinner, the po boy takes the cake. The sandwich is put together perfectly with the pretzel bread, fried mushrooms, sweet pickles, and the delectable remoulade to glue it all together. They have daily soup options that always make a great start, and the desert menu makes a great finish. Be sure to stop in on a Wednesday night for VEGAN WING NIGHT. You get a choice of buffalo or carolina bbq, paired with a vegan ranch that I would literally kill to get the recipe for. The only negative I have noticed in coming here so frequently would be that the drinks can be inconsistently made. I had taken the waiter's recommendation to try the nor'easter one night and I couldn't control my facial expression upon the first sip due to how heavy on the lemon juice it was. There have also been nights where my two regular drink options have been a bit too heavy on the lemon or lime juice depending on who may be behind the bar."}, {"review_id": "vkElnvGg0t7UOF_FwVqYOQ", "user_id": "WQDG1_b28izxQgj061FD2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "Nice vegetarian/ vegan joint.

We had the salad with: quinoa, avo, butternut squash and beets (I don't generally like beets, but I didn't mind them in this dish). We also had hush puppies w maple butter, which were amazing!!
