Service is great but the food is so-so. The fries needed more salt but were crispy and tasted good. They come with house-made ketchup which tasted a tiny bit like BBQ. The burgers weren't bad, patties were good but the toppings were underwhelming. We got the Mac daddy which was fine, but needed something extra to be great. The \"we be jammin\" was supposed to come with peanut butter and a bacon jam but it was just mixed together and I couldn't taste the bacon at all (just pb).It seemed like it needed more effort, very meh. The rebel duck was probably the best of the bunch. That one was actually good but again, not spectacular. I would recommend this place for a decent burger but just create your own and don't set your expectations too high."}, {"review_id": "XRUNzzIkvJjVsxUXoHitag", "user_id": "zVTPqOJw-5XXWzbnsOPC4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "My husband and I went there on a Friday night just to try it out.  We were able to get seated fairly quickly, although we asked to move tables.  It is super drafty and downright cold anywhere near the windows because of that I could only give them a 4 star rating.We started with a soft pretzel app that was the size of our plate.  It had the most amazing mustard to dip it in!  My husband still talks about it.  Lol.  He was very impressed with their burger and it too was huge!  I am not a burger person so I got a salad.  It's a great casual place if you live near or are in downtown Aurora.

In fact, I don't have a favorite burger here.I do like their $10 Oodles of Noodles salad.  It's a simple dish, but the noodles, sauce and avocado go well together.  The $11 Hodgepodge appetizer is also pretty good.  Tender meat, cheese curds and sauce served on top of french fries...almost like a poutine.  The tater tots here are also crispy and delicious.  The $3 side of Brussels & bacon are ok, but bit overcooked for my taste.I usually find free street parking on New York or park at the casino parking lot on River.....| \\      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,      .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \\ -  ;  ;  ;  , _    ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .  (   ` - ` -  ' - '   '  - - - ' ' ( _ / . _ ) - ' ( _ \\ _ )"}, {"review_id": "NdYG_0WgL3o4r7PUzNxXHQ", "user_id": "Ru_-GqTbhyzeUIez0f01fQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "I wouldn't even call myself a Burger person but I love this burger place!

Ordered Loco and BBQ split. BBQ tasted like it was mixed in Hunt's Ketchup and molasses. Loco had zero heat, not even sure if they even remembered to put the sauce on the chicken honestly. The wings looked and tasted like they had been under a hot lamp for 4 hours. I've never left an uneaten wing on a plate in my life but there's a first for everything.

What a terrible letdown. But first, cool place, good vibe, great music. Back to the rest of it. Sat at the bar and ordered an old fashioned and Manhattan and both pours were incredibly small for the downtown prices being charged. I'm talking maybe 2 fingers for the old fashioned. And it was decent, but hardly anything out of the ordinary. Then had to ask for water 3 times before we got any. I ordered the Rebel Duck (the signature burger) medium rare and it came out medium well. A big part of the burger is the pork shoulder and there was little, if any, on the burger. Didn't comment or send it back because we were pressed for time. My bad...should have said something.

Burgers are made of high quality meat and carefully chosen toppings, but they come a bit on the rare side so instruct your server to cook them longer.

I'm a sucker for an egg on a burger! It was medium cooked, with white cheddar, mushrooms, grilled onions, pickles, and I even tried the cranberry apple chutney on the side. The mushrooms had such great flavor I wanted extra of those!! The burger was cooked just right and the rebel was so balanced with all of it's different flavors. We can see why the Rebel would be on Chicago's Best, it was tasty-- it's a meat lovers dream with pork shoulder and bacon with fried onion strings all on the burger! I only had one bite, which was very yum and he really liked it! Too stuffed to get snickers waffle with snickers ice cream for dessert-- but wish we had room to try it, it sounded so good!! The waitress told us that the dessert option changes often but is always yummy! We will definitely be back... and we both already know what we'll order and we'll definitely leave some room for dessert.
