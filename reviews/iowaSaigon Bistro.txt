I know my stuff (if I am allowed to be a little pompous here). I will always judge on flavor, quality, and price. And Saigon Bistro knocks it out of the park. Their price ranges are excellent. A bowl of pho should never be more than 10 bucks. If it is, you're paying too much. What's pho? Lemme explain so you can go out and try it right this second. It's a flavorful beef broth soup with noodles, and thin beef slices. It's so fragrant and it's delicious. You too it with some hoison sauce (soy bean sauce, brown and sweet) and sriracha. You won't be disappointed. It is a difficult recipe to make, so support your local Viet places please! And lemme tell you, if you're new to Viet food, start here. Beef pho is delicious and you will love it, I promise. The broth is really what's important here guys. You want one that isn't greasy. So there shouldn't be any floating grease bubbles. The broth should be clear. And that's what is going on here. It's delicious. Also consider getting bun thit nuong. It's rice noodles with beef, fresh veggies and a fish sauce. I know, fish sauce sounds rancid. But it's delicious and if you don't mind a bit of a seafood breath, try it! I love this place, it always is a great meal. What to try: pho bo vein or pho saigonWater rating: 9/10"}, {"review_id": "uy8UyHk-1QcSX8VKzhP8DA", "user_id": "hLDSMWRrG7BtoTie6Fz4iA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/28/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The food had no flavor, the service was poor, and the hair in my phone was the last straw.  I have a buzz cut, so it wasn't mine..."}, {"review_id": "q8Shr1jjy1XPceL19lfZkw", "user_id": "4HCcN0z2q3GLBBJCucf7LQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Coming from Chicago, I can almost understand why this place got such good reviews, but I have much higher expectations. Good pho is all about the broth and maybe we came on an \"off\" day, but the broth was seriously lacking in spices and flavor. The noodles were slightly overcooked, even though the soup itself wasn't that hot in temp. The saigon pho which I assume is the special pho with the works did not come with tripe or tendons. The basil and bean sprout garnish were fresh. The spring rolls were a little small and the shrimp and noodles inside were still warm, so I didn't get that really refreshing taste or crunch. The viet iced coffee was delicious. It came out in the metal drip filter slowing dripping on condensed milk with a glass of ice on the side, the way it's supposed to. This is a cute little place inside and the waitress was very nice, but the food was disappointing."}, {"review_id": "LKe6J98CW4yotvqa6vmcHw", "user_id": "DRngZ_ypeOwe60N2Wnlm7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/24/2016", "text": "I've had pho all around the country and this is some of the best I've had. The staples that I get at a Vietnamese restaurant is Pho, summer rolls (goi coun) and Vietnamese iced coffee. This place deserves a 10 of 10 in my book. A little store front multi generational family operation. The seasonings are correct. Good old broth.  There's no one asking if you want chicken, beef or vegetable broth here. The coffee was done correctly in a French press. And the summer rolls were a delight with rich flavorings and lemongrass. The sauce had many flavors rather than the watered down peanut sauce of some restaurants. In my book, this is a great place to go for pho"}, {"review_id": "c9JV1t1CrawzUtCxhOdjjg", "user_id": "aYPWbl2Hye00HxFG2Qqyjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2017", "text": "I really enjoyed the Lava Beef here (marinated in 7 different peppers) while my fiancée enjoyed the pork salad.  Flavors in both dishes were very clean, and I was impressed most with not only the level of heat in my dish (quite hot but not excruciating), but that I could really taste a number of the different pepper flavor profiles; it was not an exercise in destroying my mouth.  Terrific service throughout the meal - this quaint space delivers impactful, vibrant flavors!"}, {"review_id": "cSgpbBl-czb-uou4WSyJOw", "user_id": "YUX-Qt4-7OWqS6NnFOBlgw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/31/2016", "text": "Food was good.

I yelped for pho and this is the only pho spot for Davenport. Came in here because they had high ratings. We walked in around 3pm and didn't see any customers. Didn't think anything of it and ordered. The food came out 10 minutes later. My Husband ordered the pork vermicelli and it looked gross. The bean sprouts and the mint they put on top for garnishing looked so old. The mint was almost a black color and the bean sprouts were slimy. Of course my Husband isn't going to eat it so he picked it out.My bowl of Pho Bo Vien tasted so bad that I couldn't even take 2 bites. I'm still so thirsty from those two bites because of the amount of MSG in it. I'm 100% Vietnamese and believe me...this isn't the way Vietnamese food is suppose to taste. I live in California and if they were ever to open their restaurant in LA or San Jose they would have been out of business a long time ago. I really don't like to leave bad reviews but if it's really bad, I feel the need to...so others won't waste their time and money coming into an establishment like this.If you don't know what authentic Vietnamese food is suppose to taste like...this is the place for you."}, {"review_id": "Sfpiea0_sm6wk9Db0o618g", "user_id": "0juzbrgcLHqobdK-OZAyiw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/16/2014", "text": "Three of us came to this Vietnamese restaurant for lunch after noticing a string of raving reviews on Yelp. With natural lighting penetrating the front door windows, the décor was underscored by its grey tiled floors, red and beige walls, and dark brown tables to bring about a clean and orderly atmosphere. At the time, there were only two other diners at the restaurant. The vibe was quiet and casual as we sat and chatted close to the windows by the door.The Nem Nuong ($3.99) was advertised on the menu as ground pork skewers, but it turned out to be two flat pork patties nicely seasoned and garnished with carrots, bean sprouts, green onions, and peanuts.  The iteration of Nem Nuong was drastically different from those that looked like a pork sausage or skewers of meatballs, and prompted me to verify if we got the right dish. Taste-wise, the ground pork appeared fatty and the seasoning tasted too light. It could really use a deep lemongrass and fish sauce flavor  to anchor the lifts stemming from the fatty pork. It was also not a good dish to split between three people, and I wished the server would say something about it at the time of ordering.The Pho Tai ($7.99) came with beef slices on the side, fresh veggies, and rice noodles. The broth was very weak and lacked the deep bone marrow flavors and complex seasoning to provide that deep desirable aroma. The quality of the beef was decent, and the selections of veggies were quite standard. My friends liked their pho, but there are many other superior places, including Aroy-Dee, a Des Moines establishment that many Yelpers tend to overlook. Service was minimal and limited to taking our order, bringing the food, and the check. It was a quick lunch as we got back on the road soon after the visit. Due to the high pho prices, small portions, and poor quality, I won't be coming back."}, {"review_id": "2BXKIvDV30J8w2GBdc5Iyw", "user_id": "Ry2eEdDFbB3jCd-puLq0bg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/12/2014", "text": "Davenport has a place they can be proud of!!They have an awesome lunch special, $5.99 for pho and dumplings what a nice deal.

The service is fast and efficient. The menu has an extensive variety of choices. There are lunch specials, called Bento boxes for $5.99. You choose steamed or fried rice, or noodles. Then you select a protein and sauce. The box meal is served with either a soup or salad, 2 fried dumplings and a couple of crunchy shrimp chips round out the meal. The portions are reasonable, and will satisfy all but the truly ravenous. These would be perfect for those on a diet. Saucing is very minimal and veggies are crisp and colorful. Nothing was exceptional, but nothing was bad either.  That being said, even bland Asian food is far superior to fast food."}, {"review_id": "XwLKDliABC9GvUwGU_Bbjw", "user_id": "-_GH28Y5Ctn_rFlUQn82yA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/20/2016", "text": "Man, this Iowa trip did not start off right.

But the taste was good, unique ... just a bit on the salty side though. Nothing that a good amount of rice can't fix. Wish the portions for this were a bit bigger though.

This place has done it right. I don't usually like the ambiance of an ethnic food place because it is almost always mediocre at best. This place is a little different. They have done a very good job with this place. They have diner like sitting. There is some private space for a date and a large group alike. Food is delicious. I would strongly recommend their spring rolls and noodle dishes. These are made with mixed ingredients (veg. and animal products) but you can ask them to make it in vegan and they will not disappoint you.
