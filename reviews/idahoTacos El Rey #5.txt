We didn't find one- we found a GREAT one! We've been there twice now and both times were excellent. The carne asada is perfect and their chips and salsa come with some of the refried beans they have and I could make a meal just from them. The tacos in the combos are street taco size but have enough filling to make 2 more from them. Guess that's why they serve them with 2 tortillas each. Last time there I had the carne asada tacos with chorizo burrito and really enjoyed it all. My wife had the carne asada tacos and carne asada tostado- see a pattern here?- that were also superb. And the service is also great. Both times there it was full but we were never in need of anything. Can't say enough good things about them, go in and see for yourself."}, {"review_id": "ernNpalwQvBUvdi8vFPgyA", "user_id": "27ocFgaTnAMJwTgcVWkaKA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/20/2016", "text": "The food here did not disappoint. Some of the best authentic Mexican food in the valley. I ordered a few carne asada tacos along with some of their salsa verde and salsa roja and not only was my order on point but also very satisfying. I didn't realize you could call in, make your order, and then come pick it up. I always assumed you had to be present to order. However, tonight I simply called to ask what time they closed on a Saturday night and they kindly advised me to place my order. I arrived in five minutes and my order was ready to go. It's a bit hidden and parking can be a bit difficult to navigate but well worth the visit."}, {"review_id": "U8bZgvjnIaDG0f2cpH8BwQ", "user_id": "sEL-4lDY1R7wETDGKehOYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2016", "text": "Finding good Mexican food in Boise hasn't been easy, especially coming from California where I grew up with some of the best nearby.

Looked at nearby restaurants and found this one to try. The reviews are spot on. I had their shrimp fajitas and my wife had their tamale and enchilada combo. Both were excellent.Atmosphere - restaurant basic. Food - excellent. Waitstaff - appropriately attentive. Very pleasant. Cost - water to drink, two decent sized entrees, $20 plus tip. While we were there a couple sat next to us and indicated they'd never been here either. Waiter suggested their fajitas as being good and both of them agreed after they tasted their food. One other point, their salsa. Very different in color and texture to what I've eaten in other Mexican restaurants. Different but better than most. Just enough kick.Last item and I'm done!  The waiter told the other couple they'd make your fajitas how you like them. Swap more onions for the peppers, let them know. No tomatoes, let them know. Want some kick, they'll throw in some jalepenos. If we're ever traveling through we'd definitely eat here again."}, {"review_id": "5piV2KrGveJ_AitKDL6eNQ", "user_id": "nMM9TOzaeuCkTHm8pSUcdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2016", "text": "Finally got to try the food here and we weren't disappointed! The service was quick, friendly, and very helpful.  I ordered the three tacos combo with rice and beans, choosing carnitas, carne asada, and adobada based on previous reviewers suggestions. My personal favorite was the carnitas taco, but all were great. They also provided four different salsas to try, all of which were excellent as well but I especially liked the creamy green salsa.  My husband ordered the shrimp fajitas and really enjoyed them, plenty of shrimp, super tasty, and not overcooked/rubbery.  Also very affordable which is always a plus. We will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "vRPz7azlbIbnRbNaI3Sf6Q", "user_id": "kg98Yto2EyZjFr_4j-XDhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/22/2016", "text": "This place has great food.
