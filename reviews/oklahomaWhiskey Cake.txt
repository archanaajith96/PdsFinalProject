I can't believe I haven't reviewed a visit yet. My mom is in town and this place is on the list of places we take visitors. We used the Open Table app and were seated early when we arrived. I ordered the Basic Burger, my wife got the pork ramen and my mother got the turkey burger. Best burger I've had in a long time! Easily the best I've had in OKC within the last year. The turkey burger was also really good. It has guacamole and cranberry spear on it and you'd think it wouldn't go well together but you'd be wrong. I don't eat turkey burgers often but I'd order that one for myself next time I go. The pork ramen was in a totally different arena apart from the burgers. Kind of change of scene when I tried it. It was a very Oklahoma inspired ramen. The broth was much more of a dark beef/pork base and there were huge chunks of pulled pork. It was very good but very different from traditional ramen."}, {"review_id": "8Bm0kvpRxrsttu6DrBjGUw", "user_id": "zhZYznWdc8RVD2iOCj2a_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Such a cute, hipster, farm to table restaurant! Their famous chicken and waffles are a must have at brunch and all of their burgers and salads are delicious. The staff is very friendly and helpful to those who are unfamiliar with the menu. Reasonably priced for the quality of food you receive!The Whiskey Cake is an absolute must have for dessert (add ice cream to make it even better) !!"}, {"review_id": "kMl6GhGT7S__bED4fPfUGQ", "user_id": "onNdYVW_iKL9uEV3OVOWJw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Sides were excellent. The pork ramen I tried was bursting with flavor & had plenty of spice. The roasted chicken melt on the other hand was not the best: chicken was dry & bread was hard but didn't keep the rest of the sandwich together so every bite was sloppy. Must try mac & cheese and the poblano cheese grits. Friendly service and seating in the patio area is really nice--if it's not too hot of a day."}, {"review_id": "SQ2lR2snaFJI8E6IMUhYpA", "user_id": "8CIlvjWVohcmsA2RyxArdQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I can't believe I haven't reviewed Whiskey Cake until now.

From the wall of succulents to the napkin rings on the rolls of silverware. First time I've seen napkin rings in a restaurant! The goat cheese fondue was phenomenal. I had also heard good things about the duck wings but they were so salty that day! I don't know if that was normal but it just tasted of really salty barbecue sauce. And what part of it was Thai? The sprinkle of sesame seeds? Needless to say, I was disappointed with the sauce. The Arrosto Misto was simple but yummy. It was a good snack. Service was fantastic! I can't remember my server's name but she was on top of us, very knowledgeable about the menu, and cheerful! She really brightened up the mood. I would come back to try the Whiskey Cake and one of their burgers but probably not the duck wings again."}, {"review_id": "pATmOv9vzyo1CzYAYryubQ", "user_id": "mWZ0BykjPxK9gVuLs4UW9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "I had a hard time at first finding something to order as I am a pretty simple eater.  However, I had the chicken and waffles and it was pretty darn good!I do prefer whole pieces of fried chicken with chicken and waffles but this full boneless white meat was pretty close to perfect!  The waffle was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! I could have eaten a stack by itself.The only thing I didnt love was the syrup. It was a little fancy for my tastebuds.... but then again I like that brown colored sugar juice!

We were sat right away at about 4:20 pm on a Saturday. Rene' being a southern girl, we order fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. We were both a little hungry, so we were happy when it arrived. Rene' favorite burger is the OMG, (onion, mushrooms and goodness) and she was happy to see it back on the menu. I ordered the Rotisserie \"Farm Bird\"Half spit-roasted chicken, sautéed spinach, mustard vinaigrette, gremolata.  The chicken was moist with a hint of the marinade , spinach was a little stemy. We finished our date and shared a piece of the name sake Whiskey Cake , toffee torte, bourbon anglaise, spiced pecans, homemade whipped cream, starved warm. Best dessert in town."}, {"review_id": "ZiD5hFQb4xQaAr2AlnLC6Q", "user_id": "5aIZn-ndLaJswU6EoVcG1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great food, great drink selection, great atmosphere, and great staff!
