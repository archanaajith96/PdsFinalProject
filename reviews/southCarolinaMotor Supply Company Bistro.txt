Both evenings my entrees were fantastic. I had coulotte steak with mashed potatoes my first night, and a duck dish the following evening. Both entrees were perfectly done, and flavored quite well. I also had 3 different cocktails, all of which were excellent.The only blemish was the chocolate-peanut butter pie I had the first evening. It was a bit heavy, and the portion size was massive. Definitely too big for one person IMO, but a good value for a couple to share I suppose. Overall Motor Supply Company is excellent. It's pretty similar to Bourbon (food wise at least), but easier to carry on a conversation IMO."}, {"review_id": "drCe2KiFKMv8tnt_lWLZIQ", "user_id": "Exj0GsiV_QcdTsurU4PT4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "This was a great place for a business lunch for a group of 7.  Good food, great service, and a pleasant ambiance.  The fact that they took reservations on OpenTable for a group of 7 was a plus!  I had the shrimp and grits and quite enjoyed it.  The dish was flavorful without being too heavy.  The menu had a lot of tasty things on it - the shrimp and grits, beef brisket sandwich, and fried chicken were among the most popular dishes for our group!The service was generally friendly, attentive, and efficient.  They made one error - a member of our group specifically asked what the brisket sandwich had on it, and the waitress failed to mention it had cole slaw (which this person couldn't eat).  However, after the dish arrived and the gentleman explained what happened, the wait staff was apologetic and quickly replaced the dish.The setting is spacious, casual, and inviting.  The space is a bit on the loud side.  We had a reservation for 7 people and we were seated at a round table, which I appreciated - that's definitely the best set up for a group of that size, so everyone can at least somewhat converse with the whole group.  Overall, this was a good spot for a group lunch in downtown Columbia, and I'm so glad to have found it!"}, {"review_id": "VkLSjOqcO0v28TD2HPN4TQ", "user_id": "tcEfmJBgzgkqc9WqWeqxpQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "I'm torn on this review. Cute spot, trendy atmosphere. I'm sure evening dinners here are really nice. My husband's food was fantastic (pork loin with blackberry compote and mashed sweet potatoes). My food was not. I got the shrimp succotash over rice. The rice was hard and crunchy and the shrimp was very much over cooked. I'd be willing to give it another try except we don't live here :/"}, {"review_id": "0L6WXqmr7YWEtMJSzrDAHQ", "user_id": "2xRa1ybENIx51P804kex3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Great service and excellent food!

I can appreciate the handwritten menu, and their \"green\" practice of using old menus as coasters. But, when you pay $10-12 for a sandwich, you shouldn't leave hungry. I'm not one that needs oversized portions, but the turkey sandwich, as well as the patty melt ordered by my hub and MIL, were skimpy. Served with the only side offered, a nice cucumber salad, it was a truly light lunch. It's curious that they only offer unsweetened tea. And, some of the tables inside are too close together. Out of the whole dining room available, the next people to arrive were seated right up next to us.Parking at lunch was easy right out front. Service was fast and friendly."}, {"review_id": "UfRjA320skIJJbRfi-tn_A", "user_id": "cPbnCPdYTo3VQ5CxI9_36g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Probably my favorite restaurant in Columbia.

They're located besides Social and Salsarita's and across from Blue Marlin. Parking in the Vista can tricky and taking the time to find a meter or street parking can be annoying. What's nice about Motor Supply is that they can care of this by offering free Valet parking! The decor of this place is pretty neat. This restaurant used to be an old commercial automobile building and they kinda kept some aspects of that in their interior design, hence the name. The lobby is pretty small, it starts to feel crowded with 6 or 7 people and they only have 2 chairs to sit in. There's no dress code, but there were a fair amount of people wearing nice jackets and button up shirts. The hostess stand is made of marble and has white lights on the top. You can also see the awards that Motor Supply has won over the years hanging on the wall by the restrooms. They have two main dining areas, one smaller one that's close to the parking lot so you can look outside and another that has a bar and more seating. The walls are decorated with fancy local abstract art. Our table had a candle and a jar of flowers which looked nice and really helped set the mood.I went here with a friend yesterday, a weekday, around 7 PM. They were starting to get pretty busy and we didn't make a reservation. Luckily, they have a lot of small tables so we got seated quickly. However, the group of 3 or 4 people that came after us got quoted a 30-45 minute wait so I would recommend making reservations to make sure you get a table. We were served by Alicia and she was very enthusiastic and had a very positive demeanor. She explained the menu to us and recommended some of their most popular dishes to us. She was also good at checking up on us without hovering and gave us excellent service.   The Food: What's unique about this restaurant is that the ingredients they use in their dishes are sourced from local farmers. Moreover, their menu changes daily so you get a unique and personalized menu everyday. After you order, they give you complimentary bread served with a Parsley, garlic, and olive oil dip which is tasty. For our entrees, we both ordered the Duck Duo, which is two pieces of duck prepared two different ways server with Watsonia Kombucha Squash, Geechie Boy Piccolo Farro, and Apple butter Agro Dolce. This dish is awesome if you love duck! The duck was crispy, savory, and melts in your mouth. The food here is pricey as you would expect, the main entrees were $21-$45, but the quality is worth it.Overall, this is a good place to bring a date (probably not a first date unless you're loaded) or friends and family to celebrate a birthday or special occasion. Remember that dining here also supports a local business and local farmers!"}, {"review_id": "0nEk64eJIT0LmOSMagzqEQ", "user_id": "-dnTa1fr9hrhuLru3QZueg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Great place for Sunday brunch!

Not only was the space attractive, the service efficient and friendly, and the plating instagram-worthy, the food and drink was SUPERB. I particularly appreciated the \"handwritten\" menus that change weekly. So, apologies in advance that the incredible French toast I had is no longer on the menu. But, it's likely replaced by something equally delectable. My S.O. went for a more savory breakfast option (also no longer on the menu). I had only a small bite before he devoured it, so my guess is that it was as delicious as mine. I cannot WAIT to come back to try some of the other brunch menu items and explore their dinner menu.On an unrelated note, but one that's relevant for visitors to Columbia -- this is one of the few restaurants in town where you can book ahead on OpenTable! The DCer in me really appreciated that."}, {"review_id": "bDYVvjLj7StdfQ893sG5WQ", "user_id": "66BZIDIjHP7xUrxbU94e7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "MSC is, hands down, the best restaurant in Columbia- creative, interesting menu, outstanding service, and fantastic ambience."}, {"review_id": "70-XOt1y7pxWG6dWDBHhDA", "user_id": "0V58ytGbhI9wvRPbkFUaKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Out of sight!

It has a changing daily menu. We were there firSunday brunch most recently and had a party of four seated on the patio. By noon the wait was out the door. There is a chalk board posting where the meat and produce was grown locally. I love farm to table places with innovative dishes and top notch service. We ordered drinks and four dishes. Everyone ate like A king for around 25 dollars plus tip per person. The smoked salmon plate, slow cooked brisket and savory breakfast pudding French toast were favorites.

I have been many places, and have been to many higher end/farm to table/or similar restaurants.  Don't get me wrong, they do great there, just sometimes get a little excited and add items that over complicate the food. Maybe its just the couple menus ive had? Who knows? When reviewing the final daily menu, if there are more than 5 items on the plate, asking themselves \"does this really need figs, goat cheese, and tomato jam\" maybe worth while. Read the menu before you go, and make sure that you go when it has items you desire on it.
