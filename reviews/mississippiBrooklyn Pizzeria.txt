I've been back and forth, but every time I'm here I always stop by to eat.Everything here is good. And I mean really, really good. The pizza slices are gigantic and just like you would expect to find on the streets in NYC. The real gems besides the pizza are their garlic knots. Soft and slathered in parmesan butter, they're perfect for dipping in Brooklyn's marinara, which is itself the best I've ever tasted.If you like pizza, come here. You will literally not find anything else that tastes better, guaranteed."}, {"review_id": "vI55F-0rWgQ0OHI108V4MQ", "user_id": "Dm0IBhAxIGgRwT3ExOH6jw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Good New York style pizza.

They take their time in making you a very fresh and flavorful pie. The only thing I want to warn people about is, the large pizza is extremely large. I ate one slice and was good. So tasty though, the crust has just the right amount of crunch and softness to it. I definitely recommend trying this place if you are looking for a good pizza!"}, {"review_id": "PN9AfX5G_h_P8VA1bX3H3g", "user_id": "omKACa2qBl_TtdXD2odg5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/2/2015", "text": "uhm...YUM!!We all went to Brooklyn's one night to send off some of our friends that were moving out of state. Waiting for everyone to show up, we all huddled outside studying the menu. Not a lot of toppings so It was pretty simple and I totally can appreciate that.We ordered a extra large pizza with bell peppers, onions, jalapenos, and mushrooms. The extra large pizza has 8 FAAAAAAT slices. I REALLY REALLY like the pizza, it wasn't too doughy and it wasn't flat/thin. The sauce was delicious, not too sweet (I personally do not care for a sweet pizza sauce). I also ordered a side salad which actually, is very similar to a typical antipasto-ish salad minus the salami BUT it's not their antipasto salad. Not the best but not the worst.We also had the Garlic Knots..which, I hate to say...I did NOT like. They tasted like they had been sitting out all day. I was expecting the knot to be softer and warm. It was not...So I knocked off a star.  Unfortunate because I was really looking forward to it after all of the Garlic Knot reviews.The place is not that big and It gets SUPER packed in there.. There are a few booths a long the left side of the restaurant and two on the right and few tables behind that. Order your food, sit and wait for your name to be called, get your food then sit and mangia. It does get kind of smoky in there which for some might be annoying. They get extremely busy but they sling these pizzas out right after the other.I would go back, for sure. I actually want it, right now."}, {"review_id": "i-ezdWCOlFweULZaKCnloA", "user_id": "RsmSJypR88sbTT-2beEc3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2017", "text": "We were just traveling through but hungry for a good pizza.

Pepperoni, mushroom & cheese pizza.. with canned mushrooms.. I don't get all the fabulous reviews!

I've only been in the area for a couple weeks, so my senses of what pizza back home taste like has not dulled. This is decent pizza. The only place I know of around that I can get a couple of slices, and tastes like NY/NJ pizza. The knock is, if it were in the Mecca of pizza, it would be below average. I thought of giving it 4 starts simply because it's in MS, but good pizza is good pizza, and I won't bend on that. Also, at $2.75 a slice, that price is not reasonable. Good pizzerias back home usually charge $2.00. I will probably be back whenever I crave a slice while I'm here, because it seems to be the closest I can get to home. If you want the best pizza around, this might be your place. If you want the best pizza, I suggest you purchase a plane ticket."}, {"review_id": "SSl8ipGhMOE7yLPKOUH_vg", "user_id": "rWhgf3KVlpg1Zt7o9eqfIg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/12/2016", "text": "The food is pretty good but it doesn't even matter because the people that run it are so miserable and rude I'll never go back.

Best pizza in Mississippi/coastal area for sure. I've hunted high and low for a place like this, and it's the only one around. If I'm going to be picky, I'll say that the pizza is too oily for my taste, and I think that might come from the quality of ingredients they may be using.... but we are in Mississippi, so I honestly don't know if they could even access suppliers to purchase the good stuff. When it comes to overall flavor and quality of pizza compared to the big leagues, this place probably gets a 2 or 3.... but for Mississippi, they are king of the castle for sure."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/brooklyn-pizzeria-gulfport?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
