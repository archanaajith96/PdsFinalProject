It's got a pub feel with all the standard features: great tasting burgers, yummy fries, hundreds of beer options, TVs galore, and a great patio experience. This spot checks every box and then some. It's a great place for a burger at the bar when your flying solo, date night with your boo, catching the game with friends, or a birthday dinner with family & friends--there's something here for everyone. Linda, honey, listen, listen......... the Republic Burger is outstanding. It's just the best. It just is. Get it with a sunny side up egg on top. It's beefy deliciousness with fried onions, caramelized bacon relish, bleu cheese, gruyere cheese, & arugula served on this awesome pretzel bun. DElish! Note that the burger flies solo. Take a look at their sides menu if you want fries or veggies added. I always get it with a side of their yummy fries. Also, they have this great house made truffle mayo and a fabulous house made spicy mustard sauce, too. Be sure to inquire about them when you place your order as they are provided upon request. They also have a fantastic fork & knife BLT that is divine. This is the first Republic location. There's also a location in Chisholm Creek. They have the same menu. If you like something at either location, you bet you'll like it at the other. Their food presentation is consistent across locations, which I love. The service here has always been wonderful. Full water glasses + great food + thoughtful staff = I'll be back."}, {"review_id": "jOIrnMznvOXw_lqKmTpKlg", "user_id": "uvWi1FoN6eYdFUAmS8d--Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "The Just-A-Burger is no longer in the menuBut if you ask they will make it for youGet some Shoe String Fries for that with spicy mayoGreat appetizer with it is the Ahi Tuna Tartar, oh!"}, {"review_id": "Z5VoJ69WsiDvP2bEEwULLA", "user_id": "oQxZ1u-M4_OGB_a6jd04vw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "When you sit down and review the menu, and wonder what you should get...just remember to try EVERYTHING.There's not a single bad item on the menu, but I'm very partial to the Mac and cheese.

There's something on the menu for even the pickiest of eaters, and they have a lot of snacky foods too. On my most recent visit, I went with my parents. They have been before when I first moved here, and liked it, so we went back the night they came in. Republic is open late too, which is awesome for late arrivals!We started with the onion/bacon dip, which is amazing. I could eat this with a spoon. It can be a bit greasy, so just make sure you pop a few Tums before you eat it. We then had the pretzel with cheese and mustard dips. They have one of the better beer cheese dips, without an overwhelming beer flavor. I then had the Republic burger. It's tasty.With Republic, it isn't the best food you'll get in OKC, but it is tasty! The service has always been fine. Prices are reasonable, and I've never had a problem getting table.Republic isn't the place you go when you want to blow someone's mind, rather, it's an easy, comfortable place to take people you want to spend time with, catch up with, and enjoy a bite with."}, {"review_id": "664YhH1jhx5SSkmnwuvDgw", "user_id": "f1Zvg42G6lUgmpsYfT7hVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "One of my OKC favs!

I came here once a few years ago but I don't remember much from that visit. For this recent visit, everything went well and I thought it was a solid dinner. I got the Republic burger with a side of Mac n cheese. It's not going to be the biggest burger you've ever seen, but the taste is pretty good, just cooked a little bit longer than I'd like. So initially, I bit into the burger and I was blown away. It was amazing and I couldn't believe it had taken me so long to return to Republic. As I told my friends it was so good and that I didn't know it came with fondue cheese inside of it, things went down hill. See, I came late and met up with my friends. I told them to order for me but what I didn't know is that one of my friends had added fondue cheese and mushrooms to his burger. So when we got our food, the waiter accidentally gave me his burger with the added ingredients. I wish I hadn't said anything but man, it was good. After I took a bite of his fondue mushroom burger, and he had taken 3 bites of my normal burger, I decided to be nice and offer to switch once we both knew what was going on. He quickly said yes and I  slowly gave back his more expensive burger. Now, it was still good, but it couldn't compare to the one with fondue cheese and mushrooms. It was a few bucks more, but I think I'll definitely do that next time I stop by. 3 of my friends said I have to get the Mac n Cheese if I come by. I went ahead and got that as my side and it was good but not as amazing as they made it out to be. It tastes like a homemade, oven baked, Mac n Cheese with breadcrumbs on top. Nothing out of this world but still good. The meal was a little pricey but I think you pay for the nice look and feel for the restaurant as well. TVs are all over, the lighting is nice, and they even have a nice patio outside with chairs and another TV. I'd love to come by during a Thunder game or something but that will have to wait for awhile."}, {"review_id": "jtQ-U4QXH0lyKovldUhKhg", "user_id": "XiLxIJThWsE0x4d0IeSPsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "We come here a few times a year, and we both really like it. I am unsure why I haven't reviewed it! There's no better way to watch a big game then sidled up to a big table full of friends, beer in hand... and Republic's beer game is certainly on lock! I love to bring friends from out of town here (especially guy friends) - they're always impressed. The menu has something for everyone. I love their knife and fork BLT, their burgers, and their entree salads. And, we definitely love to finish a meal here with the bag o' donuts. I love a wide-ranging bar menu  too - even though beer is definitely a focal point, they have wonderful cocktails and a good wine list. I've never had a drink here I didn't like. Sometimes, when they get very busy, service can leave a bit to be desired. We were here recently and had just a little over an hour to eat before a pretty early movie. Our server was awesome until the last 10-15 minutes. I'm sure he just hit the busier part of the evening or was sorting something out with the kitchen - it's not like he went to smoke or something - but it made us run late getting out of there. But, thanks to reserved seats at AMC Penn, we made our movie just fine, so all's well that ends well."}, {"review_id": "62JVwOh0h61Vlgth83jRzg", "user_id": "zlolHY6rKM8H6KPW2b4Gmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "I met my kids here for lunch, and we snagged a seat at the bar. Perfect for my son, who keeps up with every football, baseball, basketball, and soccer game possible. TV's are placed so that no matter where you sit, you can see the game.We started off with Pulled Chicken Nachos. So much easier to eat that the traditional nachos! These were on large tortilla chips, and serving yourself from the plate was not messy at all.  The Grilled Shrimp Salad is like no other! Plenty of Brussels sprouts, spinach, and shrimp, with lots of gouda, spaghetti squash, and other goodies thrown in. I wish I had gotten the bartender's name. She was so pleasant and efficient. We never sat without a full glass for very long, and she handled our habit of sharing with ease."}, {"review_id": "Ct-A3uv-d5pDxY-LiNJoHQ", "user_id": "-594af_E7Z9VVjQc9pJK3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/11/2017", "text": "Night before we left OKC, we decided to meet at Republic Gastropub to hang out. It's my first time, but hubby and his friends were regulars when they visit the hq! A few of our friends ordered from their local tap, but I dont drink so I would not be able to have an accurate review. We ordered the hot cheese dip and sriracha wings for appetizers. The hot cheese dip was not remarkable. The wings were outstanding! They had crunchy skin yet was still juicy! The flavors and the kick of the sriracha were there, yet not overpowering. I could really care less about the kimchi, but it was a good palate cleanser. The nuts were crunchy and had interesting flavors.Needless to say, hubby and I loved their sriracha wings so much that we had it as our meal! Our friends recommend their sandwiches, too.

Amazing beer selection-probably 70 on tap and 100+ bottle selections. I went with Spaten Optimator on tap. Will limit to 2 since it is almost 8% alc. Ordered the Republic Burger. They had me at Guyere.Interesting crowd. Mostly younger, buds, girlfriends & couples, dressed up, dressed down and after work. Some after golf. Basically, show up however you are dressed and you'll be good.The burger arrived. Pretzel bun? Nice.More than a burger. Fried egg. Bacon. Guyere and maybe Bleu Cheese? It was an unexpected assault on my taste buds and complemented my potent  beer(s).Definitely recommended. I ordered Green Beans as a side. Fantastic! Carmelized onions and red peppers paired with lightly cooked crisp fresh green beans. A real highlight side dish.Gastropub food is a little on the manly side. A few female reviewers tried decidedly pub food and panned the place in their review. Maybe you should study the menu and explore a little more. One Yelper's opinion.

I have been several times and always had a sort of \"meh\" experience. This evening I went with some friends as we had just finished the Red Coyote run, the weather was ah-maz-ing, and they have a great patio. I liked our server but there were just too many issues that left me feeling like I hadn't spent my time or money well. They were rather busy as it was 75 degrees in February and many people wanted to sit outside. Our drinks took too long, they were delivered with dinner. My food, the ruben, was missing cheese and after I asked why they took it back to the kitchen and 15 minutes later, when my friends were done, I had a very dry, very disappointing sandwich. My water was never refilled, I was never offered a discount on my food or offered something to snack on while I waited and my friends ate as they, like most everyone, enjoy hot food. My friend also got the ruben and only ate half of it as he also felt it was too dry. I ended up flagging down our server to ask for extra 1000 island and it improved after that. Our third dining partner ordered the turkey burger and she liked it but since she ordered fries for the table she was upset that it didn't come on a separate plate or come with the aioli. We all agreed we would've driven further to get a better meal for less money and we probably will next week."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/republic-gastropub-oklahoma-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
