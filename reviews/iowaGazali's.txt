It has 3 very important things in spades that more than make up for little things that aren't as wonderful (like using paper plates).1. Character2. Care3. C......flavor. I'm out of C words.The place is basically split into two rooms. The front end being a bit sillier, simpler, and home to some very random art. The back room has nice wall mounted planters and wine racks. Feels noticeably nicer. Occasionally old classic films will be projected on the main wall (which is f*cking rad).This family is passionate. About its business and its heritage. You can tell by talking to anyone behind the counter for about 5 seconds that the work they're doing and food they're serving means something to them. Which brings us to the most important part - Everything tastes fantastic. The elite Yelp event (Good Golly Gazali - way to go on that name, Pat) allowed me to try the majority of the menu. Since then I've been a return patron and decided that the spicy chicken shawarma is one of my favorite eats in all of Des Moines. I can't hype it up enough (which will inherently set you up for some disappointment. Still, it's fabulous).This is a great little place that I hope can continue to grow and cement itself as somewhere truuuuullly special in the not too distant future.Good golly it's good."}, {"review_id": "Mrt9VzdwedncKGy0DrPKTg", "user_id": "OBtVGAkrmhI6nExvvZ79og", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Great place for college students!

Gazali's wants to take you on that trip! This family owned Mediterranean eatery just expanded it's restaurant and it's menu!  Owner MJ is the most hospitable guy and his sister shares the recipes that were given to her from her grandmother and mom so many years ago! You can taste the history and the family love here! If you are a vegan like me, this is a perfect spot for a meal! Lots of great options. Some of my faves! The hummus is different then most, I have had and it was truly delicious! Perfectly spiced and good on everything! The baba ganoush has a real smoky flavor, I can't really described but it hit all the right buttons for my taste buds.The falafel pita was extraordinary, only problem I ended up having to eat it with a fork cause it was so full.. Not actually a problem! Also really loved the potato dish I had. The lentil soup was delicious, and were the the grape leaves filled with rice. I also loved the salad and I almost forgot about the rice dish with caramelized onions and nuts, you might think this is a weird combo, but no it was amazing! The atmosphere is great. Dj's and live music some nights! Belly Dancing! Indoor and outdoor seating! Lots of street parking! This is a perfect spot for lunch, dinner, or to throw a little party!

Parking is just your basic street parking so that can get a little hit or miss depending on what time you get there but the food is so worth, trust me. They dining room is very small, maybe fits about 30 people max so if you're not a fan of small spaces, definitely take it to go.The owner is amazing! He definitely has a passion for food and wine and it definitely shows. He's very humble and will answer any and all questions.I went with a friend of mine for a special Yelp event and we had samples of some of the main dishes and a belly dancer performance. The food was fantastic! I mean everything we had, was awesome! The gyros and falafels had just the right amount of sauce and spice. Their hummus had a lot of lemon in it which really made it fresh. We had so many samples I can't remember them all but I do remember loving all of them!Definitely put this place on the list because it is great!"}, {"review_id": "lrk3qOj1TUnZ7XxCeQq9HQ", "user_id": "IsV318c70gmS4FoBtlC5GA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "If you are looking for a fresh and delicious shawarma and hummus in the Des Moines metro, Gazali's is definitely it. Every time I have eaten at this family owned restaurant, it has been a lovely experience. Nice staff and quick attention, good prices and always top-notch ingredients. I also really enjoy the outside seating in the spring and summer, nothing better than a quick lunch here.Try anything but I highly recommend the spicy chicken shawarma, hummus and baba ghanouj. The falafel is also tasty, not dry nor greasy. I'm not sure if the pita bread is house made or sourced but it's awesome, I could eat lots of baba ghanouj and pita and just be happy. They also offer free cucumber water and other drinks (for $). The space inside is not huge but it is cozy.

Gazali's is really a service to the DSM area. A little background on me, I have eaten at easily 30+ Mediterranean restaurants. The stuff coming out of here is so homemade and authentic it actually blows my mind. First is the hummus. Now the hummus that they make her I know for a fact is fresh and handmade. The reason is because it is yellow, they add turmeric to the hummus. This is obscure type of hummus and you can't buy hummus in large quantities like this. The baba ganoush is so smoky and fresh, I felt like the eggplant had survived a forest fire or something man. By far in my top 3 of all time. I tried the gyro and it was so fresh too. Every ingredient they used in the wrap looks like it just came off the plant. I am almost certain that everything here is made from scratch.I talked to the owner and the food is partially halal. The day I went the lamb meat was halal but it changes day to day (sometimes the chicken is halal instead). I know it's hard to get fresh halal meat in DSM and they don't like to freeze the meat here for long periods so I would call ahead if you want to see if they have halal meat here. They are actually very pleasant on the phone too. They opened a new space too so now everyone can go there without it feeling crowded. Bottom line very authentic Mediterranean food and I would love to bring my friends here to try out the food. Family owned and I love it, they work so hard in that kitchen to make some good food for people to enjoy. This is honestly a service to the community/university and I thank them for that."}, {"review_id": "uTyKwCI12mtmQRECHoB3Hw", "user_id": "ygdrVJvN1sQYeTwNva-H-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Superb Mediterranean food.

My husband and I gave this place another try and this time we were  extremely happy with our food. We also liked the expanded menu and larger dining area. They were projecting an old black-and-white movie on the wall in there. It looked very cozy. Everything tasted so wonderful. I got the spicy garlic chicken shawarma wrap and my husband got the spicy gyro. The level of spiciness in my wrap was just right. My husband liked that they gave him the spicy sauce on the side so he could add however much he wanted. I ordered mine as a basket so I got a Greek salad with my wrap. They toned down the saltiness of the dressing which was one of my complaints last time and the salad was great. It was very big, in fact; much more than just a side salad. My husband said that his gyro was much better than last time; too. The lamb was really good and the tzatziki sauce had more flavor, too. Karen (the manager, I think) said they're now making the sauce from scratch. We both commented how fresh everything tasted and how much stuff came in the wrap and gyro. They were both bursting with fillings. You definitely get your money's worth here. I don't think any other gyro place in town gives you this much stuff in your gyro. And last but not least, their pistachio baklava was nice and dry and flaky and not too sweet. I usually don't like baklava because it's too sticky and sweet for me. But this wasn't like that at all. It was a nice ending to our meal. And I can't forget about MJ and Karen's hospitality. MJ is the owner. He greeted us warmly as soon as we walked in. He does that with everyone who walks in the door. We had met him before a couple years ago, but he still remembered us. He's super friendly and genuinely wants to know how you are doing.This place is definitely going into our rotation as one of our favorites."}, {"review_id": "IOblSNZXKPRTE4ppON2WFg", "user_id": "kK41FBXgAZoGvAyVoAa7Sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "Gazali's is truly the best in Des Moines. I love to grab lunch here weekly because the service is awesome and the food is always fresh and delicious.  For vegetarians, I would highly recommend the falafel salad. The salad is always fresh, the falafel is super tasty and the toppings bring it all together beautifully!  They often have vegetarian soups that are richly flavorful and filling. The owners are constantly experimenting with new and delicious menu items and, if you're lucky, you might get to try something before it hits the menu. And, as many others have mentioned, the baklava is really amazing!!As great as the food is, the service is even better. The owners make you feel welcome and like part of the family.

The food here is fantastic, wish I would have come here sooner. This cozy little place is in the Beaverdale area. They are working on an expansion to the restaurant, but there is plenty of patio seating as well to enjoy the warm weather. I came here with my husband and mom, and we were in for a feast, none of of knew what to get so we just ordered a bunch of things to try. We started out with the Greek salad, nice light dressing with kalamatta olives and feta cheese, not over powering but delicious! The Hummus is to die for!!! Rich flavor and made fresh! you can taste the difference! The Bobbaganush was so flavorful and rich, not over seasoned so you can really enjoy the creamy flavor and texture. All served with warm pita bread! The Grape leaves are a little sour at first but as you continue to enjoy the flavor really becomes more complex and delicious and the filling is really creamy!Finally we got extra Tatziki sauce, wow!! so fresh and flavorful!! Really complimented the gyro's well!! My mom and I ordered the lamb gyro. Wow so happy to see real lamb on the menu. It's flavorful but not over seasoned and melts in your mouth, not at all tough or dry!! My husband had the spicy garlic chicken schwarma, he loved it, he said it was a good burn but with the tatziki sauce it made it rich intense flavors!! We finally finished our giant meal with baklava, wow!!! I could eat this every day, sweet but not over sweet, we got the walnut dusted with pistachio! Delicious!!! Another note I LOVE the wall art, the donkey's are cute with their names like Sarah Schwarma. And their Hummus resource department sign above the kitchen. It's eclectic and cute! M.J. Gazali is awesome!! Super friendly and welcoming, he explains the menu really well! He make you feel like family! We will definitely be back!!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gazalis-des-moines-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
