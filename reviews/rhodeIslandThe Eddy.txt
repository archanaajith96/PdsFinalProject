In this case it was There's Always Money In The Banana Stand, which was a lot more tart and a lot less sweet than the name might suggest. I loved the egg white, passionfruit, and Thai bitters in there. At $12 it's not cheap, but you could easily find this level of cocktailery in NYC for about $15 so I was happy. I also really liked the Flor de Jamaica, which was a lighter cocktail with bergamot vodka, rosewater, and hibiscus tea. And those who are nostalgic for Orange Julius drinks from the mall should definitely go for the Orange Julius Caesar! Though it's not a full restaurant, they have lots of enticing snacks including a charcuterie board that comes with a literal loaf of bread and a tempting pretzel situation. They've managed the perfect level of interesting people watching and buzzing of music and conversation, and it's a great place to sit back and relax over your well-crafted cocktail. One of my local faves!"}, {"review_id": "gBBjAYGCCAEyJYetLMev5g", "user_id": "pkY0nQfc3Cgu4vclL7ClBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Love this place.  (If I had a choice of bar that suited my sometimes-quiet personality, it would be here.)  The Eddy is cozy, cleanly designed, classy, and dare I say sophisticated without pretention.  It has an old-school vibe, and the bartenders take pride in the perfection of their craft.  Small plates & incredible drinks."}, {"review_id": "nG_aBNPx2Zxoro5Y__Dv-A", "user_id": "6pTHuzch57b5uvHDqjMvqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "I mean-Best drinks in town. No contest. Get here early if you want a table, but I would honestly stand all night, it's worth it.For drinks we got the gin gin mule, the orange Julius caesar, and the cranberry pimms cup. All were amazing, delicately balanced, and not skimped on at all.For food we got the charcuterie board that comes with your choice of meats or cheeses, crusty bread, mustard and pickles.  We chose pork belly (because come on), and it was melt in your mouth tender.  We also tried the Cuban sliders, and haven't stopped talking about them since.  Possibly one of the best sliders I have ever had.This is definitely becoming our regular spot for a Friday night!"}, {"review_id": "RCaaPwTL6mNkfRfMNmFMDA", "user_id": "xJvZAMZS4j7_WJr4rwq_Xw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This bar has a really chill vibe to it. At first I was turned off by the fact that they have a guy at the door checking IDs, he was an odd one but inside it's awesome. It has a nice rustic feel with lots of exposed brick and clean wood. The drink menu has that old school liquor feel which I live. However, and this is a big however, the bathroom is gross. It smells like a porta-potty due to the urinal and it's just dirty and things are broken. It's like they put all their money in the bar area and forgot the bathroom.  If they cleaned/fixed it up that would make the stars go up for us."}, {"review_id": "O2p3Bn2tajbAEKK70AYT5Q", "user_id": "Weaad5psRYZvQXtpzVgbhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Best place in Providence for cocktails hands down! I've been here a few times now and have never been disappointed with the drinks. Also the service was phenomenal! The waiter got us water and drinks very quickly upon entry and found us a spot to stand. Once a table opened up he seated us there. Even thought the space is small they are very attentive to your group and make sure you are in a comfortable standing spot or seated. A lot of their cocktails are on a seasonally rotating menu so you'll always be able to try something new when you go. Every cocktail I've had was awesome. You also must eat their food. Even though this place is usually seen as just a bar, they have some killer food!

It was smaller than I expected, with seating around the bar, a couple of booths at the back and a table at the front. We sat at the bar and were given a drink and food menu. Good range of cocktails on offer covering the full range of spirits. I tried 3 all good. Wife stuck with the one she loved. The food menu came with a pencil to mark what you want; I like this idea, particularly when you're looking to order multiple items. We went for the sliders (which were incredible) and one of the charcuterie items.

It's a cute cocktail bar located in downtown with that low-light, intimate place where you can sit and talk without noticing how much time is passing by.My boyfriend and I came here after Waterfire on a Saturday at around 9:30pm and it was decently packed but we were able to sit down at a two-seater near the window. Our bartender was prompt and dressed very hip -- not super duper friendly but it was a weekend, I'm sure she had far too much going on. My boyfriend doesn't drink so the bartender made him something off of the menu that was sweet and delicious, which was super nice. I got a couple \"How you dew'n's\" ($11) after exclaiming that I wanted something similar to a mojito and it was almost exactly that.Now, it's a cocktail bar so most drinks are +$10, but they do have a couple that are like $7-$9 if you're not trying to throw your money into the furnace like me. Regardless, it's a romantic spot to sit and chat over some delicious drinks."}, {"review_id": "diUi-_jB312un5lENtE-zg", "user_id": "Lzd7FTvMOvfg9WmR4MoNxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Hands down, my favorite cocktail bar in Providence. My husband and I stopped in after WaterFire earlier this fall and were lucky enough to snag the last open table in this intimate, beautifully appointed space. Any spot that serves a solid sazerac, gin & tonic on draft, AND a mean charcuterie menu already wins in my book. Add on an expertly curated beer & wine list and I'm sold. On the food front, we started with rustic pork and chicken liver pate with black pepper plus some humboldt fog, grafton aged cheddar and a niiiice funky blue, all served with bread, cornichons, and mustard. Truly the perfect spread. I enjoyed perhaps my favorite cocktail of the YEAR here, the 'how you dew'n' with rutte celery gin, lustau fino sherry, lemon, honeydew, and ginger. So incredibly unique and beautifully balanced. As the bar was packed, it took a while to get our check which is something I never really care about because I was having a great time. Still, our server was so apologetic and took a drink off our bill for that reason which was totally unnecessary but still very much appreciated.Perfect ambiance, service, food, drink, location... honestly, it's a home run in every sense."}, {"review_id": "uKTCG1zyiKEIuuj8Szs_6A", "user_id": "ZOFT7lNT67yabUhD4PDtiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "My favorite place to grab a tasty cocktail and the bartender gave me an umbrella because it was pouring out so as you can see, the service is excellent."}, {"review_id": "oKyXHYt_9Vzc6QQlyblTXA", "user_id": "W3o61WWDdvFXc0LURM1L7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "The place is smaller than I thought it would be.

The bar sits as the focus spaceship vessel anchoring this small space where the unsmiling preoccupied bartender looked busy at 5:30 when the place was basically empty.  A lengthy menu on nice paper with a well designed layout and font also proved things were taken seriously here.   I chose an affordable Sangiovese, and had to miss out on what looked like a very tasty and maturely executed small plates menu of pates, oysters and other gourmand treats outside of the usual Providence burger and beer mindset.Sometimes rising above forces a bit of sterility, which was evident at this self centered little cocktail bar.  Providence casual aims for higher aspirations, it just forgets the comfy pillow.You might feel like you're on a boat, or a fancy dock, but regardless you'll set sail here.  The place somehow has a strong aura despite being essentially uncomfortable, but that's just its personality.

The ambiance and drinks cannot be beat. The music is always on point, and I always want to stay longer than I'm able to. I'm not here all that often because I honestly can't afford to be, but I am by no means complaining about the prices. They are fair because the cocktails are simply amazing. Their cocktail menu rotates frequently, but the bartenders are incredibly skillful so I also reccomend going off menu if there is something specific you'd like to have - they'll nail it, promise. They don't have a huge selection of multiple kinds of whiskey or vodka or whatever so they may not have a specific brand you're looking for, but what they do have was chosen with great care and attention to quality so it will be good. And they do have a lot of different kinds of spirits. The Eddy also does a mean cheese/meat plate which I highly reccomend if you're feeling some snacks. They have many meats and cheeses to choose from so you get to build your own plate.As other people have said, it is a very small bar so it may be tricky to get space if you come late on a weekend night. You'll probably have to wait or stand. I reccomend this as a first spot of the night kind of place, or for after work drinks during the week. It's dark and cozy in the winter, and a nice escape from the heat and sun in the summertime. Snag a seat at the bar if you can. I would not come here with a group bigger than four."}, {"review_id": "xZ6DyBsnFP5rzDcQ3XKY0w", "user_id": "DEED2ynPR4Z3jrllOQkJfQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "This is a nice bar but with very limited seating.  Drinks are excellent!!!

They have a few small tables to sit at as well as their horseshoe bar with plenty of standing room too. The cocktail menu is designed to bring you right into the season. Currently the drinks have warm tones and flavors for the fall and winter. I tried three cocktails the other night and had to slow down because they are so good you honestly can't stop drinking them. Some may say they are on the pricey side. I would agree but you get what you pay for here. You're not just getting a spirit and a mixer. Your one cocktail could have a spirit, a liqueur, flavored bitters, fresh fruit, and egg whites in it. The higher price you are paying is for a quality cocktail that is handcrafted perfectly every time. If you were looking for something easier on your budget, they do have a large selection of beer on draft, in can or bottle. They have wine too!The bartenders are knowledgeable and clearly know what they are doing. From the minute you sit down at the bar, you will be impressed. We to saw one of them stirring a cocktail in one hand while shaking one in the other! (The bar equivalent to rubbing your stomach and patting your head)It's always a nice time at The Eddy. Make sure to bring great company and you'll enjoy this gem."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-eddy-providence?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
