I have to admit I might not have gone inside by myself. That would have been a shame. The food here is excellent! Hot, fresh, and old-school. No scalding hot plates of soupy beans and gluey rice, with all entrees looking alike. My partner's gringo burrito was huge and delicious, and the taco and sope he got on the side were both obviously made in house with fresh ingredients. He took enough home for another meal or two. My chicken empanadas were outstanding, with light and crispy masa crust and moist shredded chicken inside. The tostada escabeche wasn't fancy, but it was good -- something Mom might make. Three sauces were put in the table along with a very flavorful salsa. There was no explanation. They turned out to be a very liquid and vivid avocado/cilantro sauce; a good salsa verde, and a delicious hot salsa with a fire roasted/chipotle smokiness. Out six year old was very happy with fries, a cheese quesadilla, and some shredded lettuce. We all three enjoyed their pineapple agua fresca (one free refill, made in-house). The ambiance isn't fancy, but it was clean, with quiet soccer on the tv rather than loud music playing.  It stayed busy the whole time we were there (though not packed) , with what seemed to be a mostly Hispanic clientele. We'll definitely return!"}, {"review_id": "4IZdg3Ly9kFpy4MZb2SAwQ", "user_id": "-ZGTUbHSWtWWOoya8ecTtA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I just moved here a day or two ago and needed something fast to feed my husband and I as we are moving into our new house. This place popped up for yelp, and had great reviews, which is so rare to have such consistent great reviews. I am originally from Arizona so I am not a stranger to the Hispanic culture... I love places like this because it actually feels like home. When I called to place an order  she was not very nice and couldn't really understand what I was saying. The moment I walked in, they already knew I was there for my take out order for a girl named Kaylee (even though that's not what they wrote down nor what they said) and when I said it's for KAYLEE, her coworker and her were laughing at me as she was telling me to pay and rolled her eyes when I wanted both red and green. I noticed with other customers, she treated them differently. Good thing I am used to it!When I got home, I ate the food... and sure enough it was DELICIOUS. So even though I was treated the way I was I will be back. I am not going to let the way I was treated stand in the way of delicious food, it is not worth it to me.  Maybe the more often they see me the better it will be in the future. This review will be updated if things get better."}, {"review_id": "t7X4AukNEVT2__80HhpbkA", "user_id": "q4-Nvtr-FlHxAZu66vm-ig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "First review of the year is a knockout. I heard about Taqueria La Hacienda from a friend who asked if I had been there yet. Not having heard of the place I inquired about it, asked the general location and made a mental note. About a week later we decided to have a going away lunch for a colleague and then everyone looked at me... I said \"I know just the place.\" and off we went for an extended lunch.I ended up having a plate called 'Enchiladas Verdes'. It comes with 3 Enchiladas with your choice of meat, I chose steak. Then the enchiladas are smothered in green tomatillo sauce and cheese and served with rice and refried beans. I added a Chorizo taco on the side. It was served with  raw and grilled onion, cactus, yes you heard me right cactus, lime, cilantro & turnip. I'm lucky I was off the rest of the afternoon because I went home and passed out into a food coma. Needless to say dinner was skipped that evening. My co-workers had 'Pechuga De Pollo La Plancha' which was a grilled chicken breast with rice, beans and a side salad and a 'Burrito Mexicano' which was full of chorizo, rice beans and cheese.The entire meal was spot on. My co-workers and I really enjoyed the authentic dishes. Everyone had high praise. Service was good with regular checks to the table and refills as needed. I'm looking forward to going again soon."}, {"review_id": "kxYqCOUz93pS1PIaYnkLXg", "user_id": "u8ybdg4OLkRXgkzR42PkSg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "THIS WAS GOOOD!! Walk in, take a seat, close your eyes, now open and BOOM you're in Mexico!! With the orange color theme, music pumping and Mexicans dining in, you know you're in the right place. I always say, if you go to an authentic restaurant and their own people is eating there then it must be the real deal.So wanting a different Mexican fare than my usual, I stopped in this Mom and Pop, store front restaurant. It's not the most appealing shopping center or heck the restaurant itself isn't either but that's when you know you're in for a treat!You walk in and seat yourself, a waitress will come serve you chips and salsa and the menu. We started off with a margarita they only had one flavor- original. Chips and salsa was nothing out the ordinary but you can tell the salsa was homemade and fresh.I ordered the chicken taco with flour tortilla and the chicken fajitas. The toppings on the taco were awesome. Plenty of cilantro, onions, and few radishes. I love the fact they warmed my tortilla over flame because it wasn't that soft steam tortillas you usually get at other Mexican restaurants but with a slight crisp texture. The chicken fajitas came out SIZZLING!! I heard the food before seeing it! It was flavorful with plenty of red and green peppers.So... something that was also a little different than other Mexican spots, are the 3 homemade sauces offered; spicy, chili verde and avocado sauce. OH MY! They were all good!!  The spicy was very HOT but not bearable for those who can handle it. The chili verde had to be roasted first because it had a hint of a BBQ taste. And the avocado sauce was just yummy! It was cold but on your food it gives a delightful creaminess.I believe this is the best Mexican restaurant in our area so far that I've been to. My new fave and can't wait to try more!"}, {"review_id": "_iMyuQBGfkiRBKpzGy-Wfg", "user_id": "0J63buZkSN6KpDPOwY9Bog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Elusive strip mall? Everyone speaks the native language? Finally... legit taco spot that takes me back to real tacos when I lived in San Diego! Got the fresh guac (medium heat) with chips - nice and chunky like it should be. Ordered 3 street tacos ($2.50 a piece) - carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor. Carnitas was my top choice! Side of rice was spot on and jamaica for my drink.

I think I found my new favorite spot! It is very affordable and authentic! This hidden gem is worth the drive to Chesapeake. My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out this past weekend. The service here was nice and attentive. I started off my ordering a horchata. They are my absolute favorite drink, but I find myself being picky when it comes to it. Well, the horchata here was amazing! It was refreshing and didn't taste powdery. They also offer other varieties of aguas frescas to choose from. We receive chips and salsa while waiting for our orders to arrive. I ordered a mix of tacos (2 carne asada, 1 chicken, and 1 al pastor) to try. At $2 a taco, its a great deal! All of them were flavorful and delicious. The homemade tortillas were the perfect touch. My favorite was the al pastor. My boyfriend ordered the California burrito. What makes this burrito special is that it comes stuffed with fries! He absolutely loved it. There was a generous serving of avocado and fries in it. Make sure to check out the little tienda that's connected to the restaurant. They have a variety of different Hispanic food and goods. I love seeing more and more tacquerias like this popping up in the area. I look forward to trying out more of their food. The best place to visit if you're looking for legitimate Mexican food!"}, {"review_id": "pEagL1pnECQRafvrPKMaGQ", "user_id": "w37ljUTqTCuVpjult2o_Pg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Great place to grab a bite!

We stumbled upon this place before they were even a shop they ran a food truck down by eastern shore where we decided to stop by. I loved the tacos back then and i still love them now. Im very pleased with the prices of the menu as well as the food portions. The flavor is amazing and i prefered their al pastor tacos than Salsitas as well as their verson of carne asada fries. The California burrito was smaller than Salisitas but way more flavorful! The food a drinks here is simply amazing! There also have a tienda attached to the main resturant which has many Mexican goods such as there popsicles which if you never tried should stop by and get some their fruit filled and close tp home made. In conclusion try this place out simple as that."}, {"review_id": "7zIq2MZnkoTchc9pyHlkmA", "user_id": "CzPy3wKx49hwuNh3-dpYMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "W O W. First time here. Just moved a week ago from Los Angeles, so my husband and I know GOOD Mexican food. The servers were very polite to us upon entering - we sat ourselves. Someone came to hand us menus, chips & salsa + taking our drink order almost immediately. We ordered the guacamole (spicy), I got a torta milanesa & my husband got a carnitas burrito. Our food came out in about 20 mins. The guacamole was fresh & delicious. My torta was MASSIVE & fresh. The meat was so flavorful and crispy. The veggies were crisp and the avocado was creamy.

Happy to see them popping up more in the area!Food:The lady and I ordered tacos, so we weren't super extravagant with our order. We tried lengua (tongue), chorizo, chicharrón, and barbacoa. The one that really stood out to me was chorizo. I have to say that they have a better tasting chorizo option that I have tried in the area. Tongue was cooked and seasoned very well. The only taco that I found interesting was barbacoa. Barbacoa tends to be pretty juicy (or greasy if that's what you want to call it), but it wasn't like that here. Could be a good thing, as people may want it less juicy, but at least it wasn't dry. Our friend order gorditas, looked very good, and she said they tasted really good. She also ordered spicy guacamole, which was definitely fresh and tasty. Ambience: I enjoy hole in the wall places. If a taqueria is tucked in somewhere odd, then you know it's going to be tasty. Seating is comfortable and plenty, but lunch rush did kick in at the end of our stay which led to some wait time for sure. Friend said that she was really happy to see the bathroom was really clean.Service:The waitress did a great job! She was very attentive! However, she did seem to disappear once it got busy, but it got busy very quick. Very understandable.Drinks:I have to add this part because they do offer fresh juices! I wish I had tried the michelada they have there. I saw one come out with a shrimp as garnish and it just looked extremely refreshing.Looking forward to come back. I saw some guys eat Menudo with a huge corona beer. Upcoming brunch like that or with a michelada to come!"}, {"review_id": "dPy1xZKdNcFx_3yyiCVePg", "user_id": "15P3JUzrj03aNMP0Dg29Mg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "This is my absolute favorite place to eat!!!!  love this place!!!!
