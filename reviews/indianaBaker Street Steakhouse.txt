We made reservations for my girlfriends birthday on a Saturday and when we showed up they sat us quickly. We had an amazing waitress named Mandy who was friendly and very attentive the whole experience. The food was amazing. The bread was fresh and I couldn't get enough of that mustard butter. I ordered the Lobster Crowned Filet and the first bite was one of those moments where you close your eyes and savor that piece with pure joy. It was so tender it took no effort to chew and the flavor was out of a story book perfect. All and all the place had a cozy kind of vibe that releases any stress you might have had before you walked in. The staff was was on point in every aspect. The food was extremely fresh and prepared well. I feel everyone should try this place at least once for the experience."}, {"review_id": "Cv_w87QxXOK4xcVd2wDtBw", "user_id": "1MWiJgmhj6tFmkE9DRJH1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "The food here is very good. I had a ribeye with mushrooms and onions.my wife had crabcakes.  My steak was seasoned well and had good flavor but I asked for medium and it was well done. I didn't complain because I didn't want to wait until they fixed the issue and it was still very good. My wife's crab cakes were very good to but she didn't care for the sauce they covered it with. She said it tasted like mayonnaise and she doesn't like mayonnaise. When we arrived our waitress failed to inform us of all the specials we could have gotten. This was a downer for me because I ordered the ribeye and was going to order the new York strip because they offered a larger cut. We found out they were offering a bone in ribeye that was a larger cut by listening to the other waiters tell their guests. We ordered wan ton tacos for our appetizer. They came out with 4 tacos being held up with two lime wedges. There was sauce under the tacos and wedges. A woman came by and asked us how it was. I told her my only critique would be the lime wedges. You need those to squeeze on the tacos. They have sauce all over them. The presentation is good but a few wedges should have been left out of the sauce so you didnt have to get sauce all over your hands. She was very nice and took the criticism well. She said she would definitely inform the chef. At the end of our meal I went to the restroom and to my dismay it was in shambles. You should never go into a fine dining restaurant and see this kind of mess. I didnt take off stars for the mess because of this because there were a lot of prom kids dining that night and I figured it would have been hard for them to keep track of them.  Even so, they should have taken this into consideration and kept an eye on the restrooms. So  mentioned it here in case they read this and will keep this in mind in the future.Overall the experience was very good and we will return."}, {"review_id": "0hFFGK7jDzWn3RqYmIZwbw", "user_id": "5hltIcM8gCxJUwOD37zi_Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Met with some clients here, the restaurant was busy, but there was another even happening nearby.Our server was very helpful and attentive.

Yelp has a link to Baker Street's website and you can make the reservation thru the website. Super easy and convenient. The environment is very inviting, and is great for a date night, or a group event. The services is awesome, and the staff really try to make your experience special. For the appetizer, we had the Blackened Scallops. This comes with four scallops with a sweet/sour sauce and bleu cheese crumbles. It tasted great!  They also have complimentary pretzel bread served with two different types of butter. I believe one is mustard  based and the other butter has cinnamon and honey. I enjoyed the Peppermint Bark Martini. It was superb, definitely would recommend. I also ordered the house salad, which was  delectable.  For the entree, I gobbled up the  yummy Cajun Chicken Sandwich. The sandwich is served on a Brioche bun, and includes bacon, onions, pickled peppers and pepper jack cheese. Instead of the sides that usually come with the dish, I had  the delicious macaroni and cheese. My other half ordered the char-broiled bacon/egg Rib-eye, which is served with lyonnaise potatoes. (Lyonnaise potatoes are  a French dish of sliced pan-fried potatoes and thinly sliced onions, sautéed in butter) He was absolutely fond of the  Mezcal Mule, which consist of some of the following ingredients:  ancho liqueur and jalapeno, topped with club soda and ginger beer. The portion sizes are very immense, so we had not saved room for dessert. Would definitely recommend this fine establishment."}, {"review_id": "-Ss7zA5Gm3Qr_cvjJFoBRQ", "user_id": "kbB14lgU53mzrpjuvO9TZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "This is the 2nd visit to Baker Street and both times they have lived up to their expectations! We had a large party, 13 of us dined on a Saturday night. We started with a visit to their very busy bar and the staff kept our drinks fresh and full! You can order food at the bar, eat at the various high-tops around the bar or just have a drink.Our meal started with some wonderful appetizers: fantastic warm smoked gouda and crab dip served in a bread bowl, a cheese and meat platter and bruschetta (least favorite). They serve plenty of pretzel bread with two house-made butters. Each meal has a choice of salad or a number of soups, I chose the lobster bisque. It's a little rich for me but the others at the table were thrilled with their house salad, lobster bisque or wedge. They are known for their steak and must say my they didn't disappoint. I enjoyed the Bleu Glazed Filet (bacon wrapped and served over a whipped potato base) cooked to a very nicely prepared medium rare. Others enjoyed the prime rib and lobster crowned filet.Desserts are all around $9-$11, many are prepped tabled-side. Overall, a very enjoyable experience with a tremendous staff doing a great job!"}, {"review_id": "3C-guEwGNV6EKIOKZvm7Bg", "user_id": "jucUGg0LDQDLRykFcROtcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I stopped in here tonight on a whim. No reservation. We were sat immediately with no wait. He ordered the lamb chops and I got the prime rib, both medium rare. My prime rib came out medium-med well. I didn't mind too much, but it wasn't perfect. He didn't love his lamb chops, but they were cooked perfectly and the order was exactly what was expected. He just hadn't had lamb in a while, and didn't love it. When the waitress asked how our dinner was, we said it was fine, because it was. Fine wasn't good enough for her, so she pressed, and we ended up telling her about these slight imperfections. A minute later the manager was at our table and suddenly we both had fresh perfectly cooked medium rare prime rib dinners in front of us. A second full dinner! We didn't expect that. They don't settle for less than perfect here. Honestly, we would've paid for our meals without complaint, but we might not have come back. We are both very impressed with their care toward our satisfaction. We ended the meal with the apple butter spice cake, which was fantastic. We will be back."}, {"review_id": "ePLUzUOJ0zDeGabi7kGI-w", "user_id": "QaXG7rpnNSoYefogI3SZWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Wanted delivery and ordered from Waiter on the Way. They're always great. Thank the gods for them because so many restaurants say they deliver but they don't ... unless you use WotW. I got the calamari appetizer - excellent, even as delivery. Good portion size for one person. Could easily have eaten twice as much lol. Will definitely order again. Ordered the Cuban sandwich and didn't want the chips that come with, so asked WotW to surprise me lol. Said I didn't want fries or chips, and wanted something $3 or less. The sandwich was oookaay. All the ingredients were good and it held up well, but I wasn't a fan of the combination. It was different ... The side salad that I received as my 'surprise' was excellent! Interesting creamy dressing and fresh, crisp greens and vegetables. Good job!Also got an order of macaroni and cheese. It's shell pasta with maybe onions, lots of bacon, some green stuff ... I'm not gonna lie, I ate it, then ate it again as leftovers, and it was yummy. Maybe a bit more than Mac n cheese, and really all I wanted was Mac n cheese. I think the food is solid, if you choose your delivery items carefully. Realize that you'll lose something in the time it takes to get to your house. I've eaten at the restaurant before and had absolutely no complaints. They do good food."}, {"review_id": "4NKfCvXabwFFL94ZZlpZag", "user_id": "K9MTfTPLDg6-LGMNq68fIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2017", "text": "Silly me, I thought the only good steakhouse Fort Wayne had to offer was Chops. After mixed experiences there for $$$$, I returned to Yelp and found two on the north side that were highly rated. Thankfully I chose Baker Street! Everything was on point and requests for customization were handled with expert hands. APPETIZER Oysters on the half shell - served with cocktail sauce + horseradish. Asked if the chef could provide mignonette and he made it on the spot! #amazing My only complaint was the person who shucked the oysters didn't release both sides of the muscle; I had to pull 'em off with a fork.SOUPOne of my favorite soups is French Onion, but many of the restaurants and steakhouses I visit have a watered down, flavorless attempt. Thankfully, Baker Street's version was the exact opposite. #delishRIBEYE + ASPARAGUS + MASHEDWhen I asked for blackening seasoning + blue cheese toping, my waitress encouraged me to get the Baker Street topping (roughly feta + blue + may + Worcestershire, etc.) and she was SO right. Best steak I've had in Fort Wayne.I would like to personally thank my server (receipt says \"Eby\", although I do not think that's her name) for the amazing recommendations and a very memorable meal!

Food is delicious. Would recommend! Anywho...This is the best restaurant in Fort Wayne at its price point ($20 minimum/person). I'm comparing it to places like Corn n cleaver, Eddie Merlot's (which is more expensive). I've been here a handful of times, for both lunch and dinner, and the food and service is top notch for every visit. For appetizers I would recommend the smoked Gouda crap dip in a bread bowl--definitely not low calorie, but this stuff tastes amazing. Comes with baked pita bread. After you eat all the dip, you eat the bread bowl, which is soaked in the cheese dip...delicious. For entrees, you cannot go wrong. The salads for lunch are amazing--I would recommend the ahi tuna salad. They also serve hamburgers at lunch, which are made with a custom brisket mix. Their onion ring sides are also massive, and perfectly deep fried. At dinner, I would recommend a steak. The last time I went for dinner they were serving steaks \"cowboy style\" (IIRC), which came with an egg over easy on the steak, plus some sort of bacon glaze. This is incredibly rich, so if you're used to lean meats; be advised! Eat this with caution! Overall, you cannot go wrong. I've never had anything here that was anything but delicious. Most importantly, this restaurant is worth the money. It is expensive, but it is NOT overpriced. It presents its customers with good value...too often steak houses are not worth the money, but I can assure, you will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "kFDEiwja6NASBvJmZ-w_WQ", "user_id": "ML97QTvFzEJvtPef5fFcdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "1) Wonderful wait staff, super engaging and knowledgeable. 2) They're definitely a steakhouse, and they do it right.

Price was pretty reasonable, with their smaller steaks ranging from 30-40. Other entrees range from 10-40. Their menu did a great job of leaving me with a tough decision on what to get. I ended up settling on the king crab Rangoon appetizer special and the lamb chops, which came to $47 after tax.I forgot how much food steakhouses provide. The Rangoons were excellent, with a little stir fry mix serving as the bed with two good house made sauces. The lamb was average. The flavor didn't have a good char to it, and the sauce/mint didn't come through. Everything was heavy on the oil/butter. Not ruth's Chris bad, but it definitely detracted from the look and flavor.Service was top notch. Friendly and very attentive without being overbearing.

Oysters are not listed on the restaurant menu but they do have them.  Glad I asked since it's why I stopped here but I'm sure I would have liked the shrimp cocktail too.  You can have them made any way you like!I had mine made with garlic lemon butter and cheese on top. Also had the French onion soup.  Oysters were very good.  Only got a little shell in 2 of the 6.  But they were still good.  Soup was very salty (and I am a salt lover!) and just warm so the cheese was barely melted.  I was going to ask the bartender for a reheat but 10 minutes later, I still hadn't seen any staff.  I was ready to go so I drank it like sweet tea, and kind of patiently waited for the bartender or any staff to return.  $17 for 6 oysters.  Fyi...since it's not listed on the menu.I will try this place again since I am in town for a while and update.Update:  lobster bisque didn't have any real lobster in it and came out cold!  Not even warm!  Really?  Oh, and I had to pull shell out of my mouth.  If I got to do that, I should be eating some big old hunks of lobster!  There was barely a flake.  Got the same oysters. A couple had enough shell in it that I had to spit it out.  Couldn't push through the crunch.  Cheese was barely melted, oysters (and juice in the shell) was not even warm either.  Last time the oysters were not hot but at least the cheese was melty.  Guess this place doesn't do hot  food.IF I ever go again, I'll just get a steak.  They are onto something, just need some work in the kitchen.Side note: 3 seats were taken at the bar when I got there.  One would think that with 4 people and a manager behind the bar someone would have spoken to me.  Took several minutes for someone to acknowledge me with a hello."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/baker-street-steakhouse-fort-wayne?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
