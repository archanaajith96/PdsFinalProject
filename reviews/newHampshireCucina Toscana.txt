Not much atmosphere, long hallway to enter, then just a dining room full of tables & chairs. But the food & service are very good. We had a sweet, attentive waitress who recommended a terrific glass (or two!) of red wine to Aunt Martha.PRO - Auntie got shrimp marinara which came over big plate of tender pasta. Didn't come with a salad. She said it was yummy & was only able to eat about 2/3 of it. I got the haddock francaise, a special. A nice sized, VERY tasty breaded haddock filet. Flavorful lemon sauce on top. Came with a garden salad of mixed greens with Italian (go figure!) dressing. We both had coffee & split a dessert, lava cake that came covered in whipped creme w/chocolate sauce drizzled over it & the vanilla ice cream alongside. CON - Something neither Aunt Martha or I realized was that my haddock francaise came with only mixed veggies. We somehow assumed it would have come OVER pasta. The tablespoon of mixed mushrooms, onion, pepper & broccoli, looked like it was just part of the sauce. Our error, but it was a real bummer, as it would have been PERFECT over some pasta. They lost a star for that, sorry to say.SO - Definitely a very good meal with excellent service. Aunt Martha made note of that wine to get some for her home. $77 with both meals, dessert, 2 coffees & 2 glasses of wine, before tip. We'll be back. Next time I'll double check to be sure I get some of that good pasta with my meal. If you are up that way, look around & find it. Cucina Toscana is definitely worth a trip."}, {"review_id": "rz9rROv4mFxlikYmAD6i_A", "user_id": "RfbE5yot-BYnxJh3lpxAhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "Loved it! Looks like a little itty bitty restaurant but when you go inside it magically turns into a bigger place! I had the chicken capricciosa..... chicken, peppers, big mushrooms, tomatoes.... they give you a steak knife, but the chicken is so tender there is no need for it....so yummy! And somehow the food stayed hot! Again... like magic- just stayed hot hot hot to the last bite I was able to put in my mouth. The bread was warm and soft and flaky and fabulous. The garlic and oil was wonderful- I overheard that they chop the garlic and then cook it over the stove. Awesome! Knowing and expecting the difference between a restaurant pour and a home pour of wine... I was super happy with the nice full glass of wine I got!It sounded like they had been dead all day and then all of a sudden got busy at 7- but Billy still stopped by my table often and took great care of me- although, poor guy I think was likely ready to go home for the night! I don't live in NH- but if I'm ever back this way I will most definitely eat here again!"}, {"review_id": "CSReOdqHryFV0yIrn75X1w", "user_id": "B2F7f8NdlBUESv8cskE-jw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/16/2017", "text": "After some bad Italian food experience down in Boston, I almost given up hope, then I decided to give this Italian joint next to my hotel.  It had a somewhat dark theme décor cozy place with just a handful of tables there.  It had a very neat mom and pop feel to it with few kids cooking the back.I was still craving risotto after the previous poor meal I had down in Boston.  I went with the Risotto Di Mare here, it came out to be quite unexpectedly good.  The portion was huge for a seafood dish, almost can feed two, and the seafood was prepared with excellence.  The rice was cooked perfectly, just right amount of softness and evenly seasoned.The entrée was so good that I had to get a dessert, and their Peanut Butter Explosion cake definitely exploded with flavors inside my mouth. If you are in this area, definitely give Cucina Toscana a try, especially you are feeling the mood for Italian food.  All of the staffs had been very friendly, and service was top notch."}, {"review_id": "T1vKYqpQiTxnzfFMQxS1hQ", "user_id": "PLx2Xn-MvOL2NSK2oOuOpA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "A very busy restaurant and treason is obvious. The food is very good. I had the veal parmigiana which was delicious. Their bread is baked on premise and is fresh and delicious. The only drawback I found was the pasta. It was cooked properly and tasty, however they give you a small dish that is maybe 3 fork fulls . I could see if it was something extraordinary. But this was straight out of the box.  All in all it was a good place to eat.

After about 4 forkfuls of pasta, I was left with a lot of chicken.  It was good, but for $16.00 I would have expected a decent serving of pasta to accompany the chicken.  The server actually took the bread away while I was still eating it.

After half hour with tables open and set in the dining room, and no update I queried on how long until we were sat and pointed out the open tables.The guy was very defensive saying the were very busy and then a server came up to help me to which he responded, \"you deal with them\". Honestly, what host would say that? One that doesn't deserve that position. This person is the first impression and should update patrons on timing instead of leaving the post for 5 minutes at a time and leaving everyone to wonder.The server we had was awesome and saved the evening, but we can't get past the awful beginning."}, {"review_id": "xUmUlBQl52b8K6u7FkoJhg", "user_id": "zLQuzMND9QhuR6oCPanRxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "A hidden treasure, we have been going here for years.

We got lucky and were seated right away despite having no reservation. The host and waitstaff were friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered the Scallops Limoncello for an appetizer, with Lobster Scampi as my wife's main course and pasta and shrimp with Gorgonzola sauce with a slab of steak on top (I can't remember the actual name of the dish). The scallops were wonderful, but the light cream sauce with a hint of lemon flavor put it over the top;  Beautifully done!Both generous entrees were from the specials menu.  My wife was VERY pleased with the Lobster Scampi. Her only regret was that she would eventually run out of the leftovers that she took home. As for my Gorgonzola Pasta with Steak, I love Gorgonzola as a cheese, but as it turns out, I'm not so thrilled with it as the basis of a pasta sauce. Still, the large slab of steak, cooked perfectly to order was wonderful, and the 2 large shrimp that are part of the dish were delightful.

The location is an unassuming strip mall mixed in with a Chinese restaurant and a SuperCuts. Inside feels homey and sort of like an Italian Restaurant located in the North End of Boston. The meal started with wine and fresh baked bread with dipping oil. I had the Frutti Div mare over Linguine..very good and only $21.99! My wife ordered chicken parmigiana and my daughter the chicken Alfredo with pasta. Each meal was great with large portions. Service was attentive and managers checked in with us to be sure all was satisfactory. This place with its great smelling kitchen is a good bet! Our only complaint was ck the water glasses for floating black specks!
