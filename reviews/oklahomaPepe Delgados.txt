Their salsa kept me asking for more chips. The sope, though, was my favorite. The pork was super juicy, the ingredients were plentiful, and the bread was perfect. They were also generous with the cheese. Their enchiladas were ultra cheesy with a tangy sauce and fresh cilantro in gigantic portions."}, {"review_id": "mTLqqRaqnZmqq4kSjSWW7w", "user_id": "zZZx_O0g7Z7XgZH-Hz2nbQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Went there for lunch on a whim.  Regrets abound.  Cashier/waitress had no clue about the menu.  Rice was a step below  Minute Rice.  Beans were garbage.  Taco would've been decent if they hadn't covered it in raw onions.  Enchilada was garbage, no flavor.  Burrito was too fat to eat without a fork and was filled with lettuce and raw onions.  Orange-Lime margarita tasted like salted orange juice.  Beer was over-priced.  Almost $40 wasted on a very disappointing meal."}, {"review_id": "Gf67NcW5Jl6nAZJZ1lg2GA", "user_id": "76ys6xKELOu2aG-irEbPwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "First time to Pepe's and it did not disappoint.

Sadly, so did I. But I had to order them after my meal came out. I'm sure in this carb-less, hipster world, that I shouldn't have *assumed* I'd actually have something to put the steak, onions and bell peppers into. But apparently I had to specify I actually wanted fajitas, not a salad plate. Also, you can't order a combo (steak and chicken) plate of fajitas; which is why I decided to go ala carte in the first place. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, steak fajitas and chips and salsa. The dismissive bartender, the bland food and the absolutely customer-insensitive menu makes this a place I will never return to. With so many other good places to eat on Campus Corner, why bother?"}, {"review_id": "SDmbU93f3MwmywF6q-wZzw", "user_id": "doZtYqj8WtT_p67-ErxXpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/4/2017", "text": "One of my favorite Campus Corner staples! Everything on the menu is truly incredible & the staff is always friendly. Ingredients are very fresh & you will NEVER leave hungry (trust me). I usually get the Plato Mexicano which is everything you could ever want in life from Tex-Mex joint. It's kind of like a deconstructed taco plate where you can build your own tacos (comes with seasoned meat, avocado sauce, lettuce, tomato, warm tortillas & rice+beans) You could easily split this plate between two people, but if you're super hungry, then dive in! I've also tried the quesadilla which is amazing as well (just a lot of food).On a diet? Another one of my favorite things about this place (besides the family feel of the staff) is how accommodating they are for dietary restrictions. Eating out on a low-carb diet can be difficult, but they are super nice with ensuring you get what you want. I sometimes get a side of seasoned chicken over lettuce & a side of avocado sauce. You can also get a fajita plate (just minus the tortillas, rice+beans) and it hits the spot just right. Don't be afraid to ask if you want to make your own custom plate!Lastly, they have a really good beer selection (including some local breweries!) If you're looking for a great place with A+ food, excellent service & good local flair, this is it!"}, {"review_id": "7MnbaJ98M-sO-FPVOAPV3A", "user_id": "Ah4D5mA-33WRBuZiM0yc2A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Authentic!

They are definitely going about it their own way. The menu is certainly truncated as compared to many competitors. (Specialization isn't a bad thing.) Most of the menu items can be ordered with cheese, chicken or beef while some can be had with pork which makes ordering quicker and easier. The line moves quickly for ordering, so the simple menu is a good thing.The cashier was courteous and helpful and willing to help with any questions. But, the preparation took longer than it should have with a light crowd. Thankfully, the chips and salsas--ordered as an appetizer--were quite good. All four salsas (picante, avacado sauce, Fresca, and tomatilla) were unique and tasty though none delivered any heat.The food in general was not prepared with much skill: soggy tortillas were draped over loose meat. The rice was one sticky mess, and a gigantic pile of coarsely chopped cilantro was dropped in the middle of the plate. The menu does say that the meal comes with cilantro and onions, but I was not expecting it as a garnish. As for taste, the beef was fair to average, but the salsa verde is overbearingly sweet. The soggy tortillas were not worth eating. The rice tastes much like El Chico's recipe. The black beans, though not unique, were satisfyingly good. All-in-all, the food was okay if a little hit-or-miss. I can't imagine anyone would object to the flavors, but I, ultimately, did not find them compelling. Cooks and tastes vary, though."}, {"review_id": "Z_sJMcPs5fj6H-SGL4FXzA", "user_id": "C-7s9NFtj6L2gv2x9sBvzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2017", "text": "Great location on campus corner.  Really flavorful food and a great price.  Fresh ingredients.I had the #16 burrito with pork.  It was great.  I will be back."}, {"review_id": "yMPX6IkfpYV63eTJdvNwIg", "user_id": "9LAKM84TUBjHWBNrFVtO0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/27/2017", "text": "Excellent place to eat and have a drink.  This is not tex-mex food, but its delicious and there are vegetarian options!  Will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "3uXx-Y98lMtmgSyEtvRXkQ", "user_id": "T8myi7c6UCWLgha85Iuwlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2017", "text": "I starting going to Pepe's for two reasons:I was a vegetarian at the time and a broke college kid.
