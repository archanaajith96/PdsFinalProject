The green chili is perfectly flavorful, with just a little bit of heat, and when it mixes with the hash browns and eggs inside the burrito, time basically stops to let you enjoy what's happening inside your mouth.I've always had great service and the prices are really reasonable for the amount of food you get. I'll admit that I have a lot of nostalgia for this place (I spent many a lunch period here during high school), but I promise my review is unbiased!"}, {"review_id": "RQ0w0d9gF-H25jpoULRQ8Q", "user_id": "_9bZB3wnSO4ni2lzT_18Nw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "As much as I wanted this to be an awesome restaurant I cannot review it as such. The staff is nice and the decor is pretty neat so that is a plus. Parking is a nightmare as is the wait for food. When I mean wait I mean an hour. Some tables that were seated after us got theirs faster but they appeared to be regulars. The rest of us commoners were forgotten for over an hour. We did get some refills on our drinks but those were few and far in between as well.The food did eventually get out with an excuse that a HUGE order of to-go burritos had come in just before ours and that is why our food took so long. Well I can understand that so we excitedly began to eat our meals. The portions are GINORMOUS so you will not want for volume. What you will crave is some form of taste. The food is bland and poorly salted. I would certainly suggest some seasoning work. I may try again but I doubt it."}, {"review_id": "bA6W64K2AuVRH7XiPPoHQQ", "user_id": "t4q7FWq0SSQC8nY1BkyZtg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Great food, cool little place, decent prices. I am knocking one star off for two reasons: 1) The staff can be rude & 2) Not open on Sunday's. We found this out yesterday morning when we went to try to stuff our faces with the best breakfast burritos around just to find we would have to settle for Perkins.  While I can understand that the staff may be rude due to being a small staff in a small building with an expected high output, I really cannot completely ignore the issue. Otherwise, realistically, if the staff friendliness was better, I would be happy to give back the star. The not being open on Sunday's is something I can get over."}, {"review_id": "85CF2qm5pY9WXxHodhVfRw", "user_id": "KXjgU8PLm05BKVkkpIrYFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "nice brunch restaurantdelicious green chili"}, {"review_id": "P_e5BLI54MXTkBo8-1qaiA", "user_id": "QAHB6uTSfpDpro8DHl7r1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "If you come here you have to try a breakfast burrito smothered in green chili, super good food.

As a foodie, well, I just can't get enough of their breakfast burritos.  They know how to make them, and they make them over and over.  If there is one thing you get, get the burrito.  I recommend getting the sausage burrito smothered hot.  Gerry, the guy who owns the restaurant, will often be seen there in shorts working as well, so feel free to talk to him, and talk about Elvis, since you can see lots of Elvis memorabilia all around you."}, {"review_id": "M2CzSK1fKTWWos4qxloAAA", "user_id": "j-CISEhkohZKFpDn7uy18Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "Had the breakfast sandwich and it was amazing!

Not sure what the hype is about the breakfast burritos. They were bland. I got the chorizo breakfast burrito. Definitely not authentic Mexican chorizo! Lacking flavor, hash browns were basically warmed from a frozen bag and not crispy at all. I had to add salt to mine to make it edible. My husband liked his although he asked for green sauce and it came out with red sauce. Nice waitress and clean place.

I have a house full of people due to a death in my family. We wanted to order some burritos to have delivered to our house, I know that you guys get busy as I've been to your place many times but Really get some people that know how to handle customers and don't rush people, and are not RUDE!!!!!Anytime  I said anything it was OH we don't dont Do that Oh we charge 2 extra dollars to put chile on the side OH we don't Deliver where you live Oh it's going to be over an hour to get them to you over an hour for some burritos it's ridiculous. we went elsewhere and I have a lot of family and people at my home that are aware of how this was handled,Just really makes me sad and really to bad because I know the owner and what a nice man he is, maybe his staff need some lessons from him on how to deal with customers appropriately."}, {"review_id": "Hu6-7WiOXwnZF-4pgOukIw", "user_id": "692cg2kBGzTqBBdU8AE5XA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/29/2017", "text": "We had an extremely poor experience this morning at R & B breakfast club. We waited 40 minutes to be seated, which was fine BUT then we waited an HOUR and 30 minutes for our food. It wasn't until 10 minutes before we got our food that our waitress came by to say they were running behind. She took off 1 cup of coffee from the bill. As we checked out we explained that we waited for 1.5 hours to get our food and the lady at the register was rude and told us an hour and a half should have been expected, never apologizing. Aside from slow service and a rude employee, the omelette and burrito were very delicious hence the 2 stars instead of 1."}, {"review_id": "u0vgrGmciA5JAgT9z-0pUw", "user_id": "KWfysX9vEaIg3Mf36AnjpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/14/2016", "text": "There are a few things in life that are truly life changing. For the most part, regardless of what happens things stay the same. I guess if I had to list my top five life changing things they'd be, my first love, marriage, fatherhood, divorce, and the steak breakfast burrito with green chili. I know you're probably rolling your eyes right about now, but hear me out. I'm a bit of a green chili connoisseur, and I have a passion for food. Sure the passion for food at times means six McDonalds cheeseburgers at two in the morning, but at other times its a great appreciation for the finer things in life. I walked into R&B last month, slightly hung over, and thinking of going back to bed. I ordered the steak burrito with green chili, and at the first phenomenal bite it hit me, I'm not doing anything with my life. I've been sitting at home forgetting to live, meanwhile someone was at work making the best god damned burrito the world has yet seen. It's inspired me, and made me wake up every morning with a passion for life again. I have purpose in life again, and I thank you for that, steak burrito, thank you R and B breakfast club."}, {"review_id": "oKCruFrnEtPMDby-rDUNKA", "user_id": "YZbsFiD_7Srx91ML1tJsQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "Best burrito in town!
