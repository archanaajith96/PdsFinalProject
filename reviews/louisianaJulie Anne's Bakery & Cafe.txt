I personally hate king cake. I know, I know. I'm a terrible Louisianian. But I decided to pick up a cinnamon sugar king cake from Julie Anne's since everyone says it's the best...oh em gee! Julie Anne's has completely changed my mind on king cakes. It was surprisingly moist. The icing is my favorite part. It adds the perfect amount of sweetness without being overpowering. You better make sure you lick up every last bite!My typical go-to orders at Julie Anne's are the turkey walnut wrap and/or a petit four. The turkey walnut wrap tastes so fresh and light. I love the crunch of the walnuts and the sweet secret sauce. Julie Anne's also makes THE BEST petit fours. I've never found one that compares. My family likes to order their larger petit four cakes for special celebrations. All of the cakes I have tried are amazing. Way to go Julie Anne's!"}, {"review_id": "6JMq_E-dzdPy2caODBL1Mw", "user_id": "1RVHMsCDdYSdHuawZ0bJ_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "My life will never be the same after having a slice of the Pralines and Cream Cheese king cake. Holy cow it was good. I also bought a whole traditional sugar and cinnamon but haven't tried it yet. Planning a trip back before Mardi Gras to pick up a whole praline cake. It was tender, flaky, flavorful, and generous amount of cream cheese icing. The staff was friendly, helpful. So glad we stopped!"}, {"review_id": "5dEwCSQUbTziPyGHr1-GOQ", "user_id": "-594af_E7Z9VVjQc9pJK3g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "It's Mardis Gras season and what better way to celebrate than a King Cake, right? A couple of people recommended that Julie Anne's is the best, as well as good yelp reviews.Julie Anne's Bakery & Cafe is right next to Walgreens. There's a lot of parking spaces available, and I've seen a lot of people stop by to pick up goodies.I love the feel at home vibe and the cleanliness of the facility. A staff greeted me as soon as we walked thru.My orders for take out: 1 sticky bun, 1 loaf of wheat bread, 1 slice of apple cinnamon king cake and 1 slice of strawberry king cake. Bill came out to $16.83 plus tip. I was not really fond of the sticky bun. The dough itself didn't taste good. It was also too sweet. I then tried a slice of apple cinnamon king cake. I had a huge rush of sugar in my mouth that I cannot sample another bite. The strawberry cream cheese was more decent, since the tartness of the strawberry and saltiness of the cream cheese somewhat cut through the sweetness but still sickening sweet. Among my loot, I enjoyed the freshly baked bread! It smells so good and has a good texture to it. I need to try other menu items, including the savory side to see if I can give them a better review."}, {"review_id": "0pknSOvEDqCoyW79LsmaSA", "user_id": "UyEAiZX98HtHeMplF9NgyQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "The shop is very close to my house. I went here for a breakfast with my bf. It was busy. We had to wait for awhile to order. I got the special hotdog and my bf got a burger. It were really good. Pickles and chips are served with food. The reason why I gave 4 stars cuz we had to wait quite log time to get food. I almost finished my coffee. Their staffs are friendly. Cakes look good.

I bought a carrot cake after numerous recommendations by peers of the quality of the bakery. The cake itself was very rich, very decadent, and appropriately moist. The icing though... That icing wrecked the experience with the force of an ingrown wrecking ball. The taste is overbearingly sweet, even to the point of being artificially so. Definitely difficult to discern the cream cheese component. The saving grace was the small amount of icing lathered between the slices, which allowed me to easily abstain from the large amount covering the end. They offer a variety of other pastries, cookies, cakes, and pies. Did not try their savory options.Coffee selections are limited to household brews with limited selections. The store itself is very down South, clean, cute, and quaint. The staff is very nice and friendly. Outside is a baby blue house tucked on the corner of the adjoining Walgreen's. Plenty of parking available."}, {"review_id": "KHhjvDpMLl5cJQOpyrtsFA", "user_id": "aMOZOQCMY5QMB1UpV_REkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Wow,! this place is super busy it was paced including all the tables were taken.

We had the Ćevapčići and the Lean and Tender ham sandwich.  Both were delicious. They bake their own bread, and they were served warm. The Ćevapčići is a Bosnian dish made with a fresh in-store made sausage, onions and other ingredients. It was great. It came with two sauces that you put on before you eat. The ham sandwich was also great and came with chips and a pickle. Would highly recommend.

We went in for a late breakfast. They have every kind of pastry you can imagine, as well as bagels, wraps, and 2 egg plates, one with bacon, one with sausage. No omelets, no pancakes, etc. Just those 2 choices. The food came on To Go paper, on a china plate. It was awkward to try and cut the food on the paper without eating the paper! Ask for \"No Paper\" if you order the eggs! The meat servings were generous - 2 large sausage patties, or 4 big strips of bacon. Everything was delicious. We also opted for a custard-filled chocolate pastry for \"dessert\", and it was generously big and delicious. Highly recommended, especially for the baked goods!"}, {"review_id": "o0xJ1UVLJDtpu2YBgmFMcQ", "user_id": "qqC6ncA6_bzc4v5R4hTPpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "Any time we pass through Shreveport we come here!
