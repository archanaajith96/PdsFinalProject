I normally get unflavored lattes and at any other place, I'd need to add sugar because the coffee tastes burnt! Not here!! I do love their flavored lattes too, especially the Cardigan. The cortado is a concentrated espresso/milk mixture which is also delicious! And if you order it to stay, you get some sparkling water to cleanse you palate. Even the basic coffee is good (I normally don't drink regularcoffee). They provide a description of flavors present in the coffee and it actually tastes like the description! Head down to Lost Cabin later in the day to taste their Smokewagon beer which is made with Pure Bean coffee!! Love this place and their friendly staff!"}, {"review_id": "qCrgZDyVQRrGJrwotCWhDw", "user_id": "-scf957OR5saLNAeHSKUoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Nice place! Friendly staff!

The first shop we were inspired to enter happened to be a fly fishing shop. After browsing a bit, we asked for a recommendation on where to go for a good cup of coffee - not Starbucks which has clearly made its presence known around this town.We were directed several blocks away to Pure Bean - we were told that they roasted their own coffee beans and made really good coffee. We thanked the man kindly and proceeded on foot for the several blocks.I was pleasantly surprised and delighted by their sign protruding from an old brick building - a former creamery. Further delight ensued as we walked in and looked around. Big open space, great aroma, rather quiet, and also busy up at the counter.Their coffee menu was well displayed. I noticed the name \"Cortado\" and asked about its preparation. They said they make a double shot of espresso to which they add about an equal amount of steamed milk - much less milk than a latte has. To me on that slightly chilly day, it sounded perfect. And it was. Perfect. My SO ordered a Mocha coffee and loved it (I tried it and loved it, too). He even ordered a second one to take along on the long drive ahead.After learning they baked their own goodies displayed on their counter, we also got a chocolate pistachio biscotti and a chocolate chip cookie. We made the right decision there, too. Both were excellent! Great coffee and a delicious baked treat were the perfect things to stave off the mid-afternoon slump and proceed on on down the road another few hours.Talking with one of the owners (Nick), I learned they're opening another Pure Bean shop this coming November in Sioux Falls, SD. Although it'll be much closer to home than Rapid City, I can't imagine driving there regularly from St. Paul, MN to get my supply of coffee; however, there's certainly the option of ordering beans for home delivery. Fortunately, I won't need that for a little while since a bought a bag of their espresso beans to take home."}, {"review_id": "BAdzeJ-IcBSzqAo1e2IwBQ", "user_id": "-IHHZ9UtUV6j0H48JFje7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/12/2016", "text": "This place...! (I'm sure you didn't expect it to start like this.)The place, that is Pure Bean... If there's one thing that I'm glad for it's the fact that I've found a great coffee shop.Formerly only a business that was roasting and distributing. These brave souls decided to open a storefront and took up shop in the old Black Hills Vinyl space (after they moved), and oh how glad am I that they did so. As coffee goes they know exactly what they're doing and have become the premier bean that I use for my brew.But I've also ran the course of their menu from their cold brew to lattes to their specialty iced coffees. It's all fantastic.And if coffee isn't your thing then try their small desserts because they are also worth the adventure (Though they only have a modest selection.)The ambience is 'hip' with a little bit of 'ster' but it's what I've come to expect from such businesses.It's full of light, a little rustic, and still has a comfortable feel to it all. The staff is knowledgeable of the science, of their product, and are they more than willing to share it with you. They've fielded a few of my questions and I'm appreciative of the wisdom they've bestowed.So, 'This place...' They have it, and I'm glad to have found it. Great people, a great bit of knowledge amongst them all, and a great product for us to enjoy. That, my fellow Yelp'rs is what makes up Pure Bean."}, {"review_id": "BjsonOTxXB_8Ef_JsLV0uw", "user_id": "ucuYGCaF-auhvu3UwVlsZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2017", "text": "Slowly making my way through the coffee shops in rapid.

I've never had an issue with connectivity or speed of the WiFi here. And the baristas are always very pleasant and willing to chat with you (could be bad if that's not your personality). The fresh baked treats are often delicious and unique. I always get a lavender cold brew and it's always delicious! I wish there were more food options so if I need something more than a pastry, I have options. And the chairs to sit in aren't always comfortable if you're planning on being there a while to study/chat/hang out.

Coffee is NOT bitter, their air roaster is top notch, espresso machine, one of the best money can buy. Staff is friendly, loving, artistic, and actually cares about what ingredients, temperate and care go into every drink. This is BY FAR one of the best cafés I have been to. Wifi can be slow!

It's a blessing to find a true speciality coffee shop when I'm back visiting family in South Dakota. I was immediately impressed when I looked at their machine, I was blown away when I ordered a breve macchiato \"a little wet. In between a macchiato and a cortado\" and got the perfect wet macchiato, complete with a perfectly extracted ristretto shot and flawless micro-foam. I ended up talking coffee with these guys for fifteen minutes. They know their stuff! I truly couldn't be more impressed with this place. If you're the type of consumer that has strong opinions about the measuring of coffee using the volume versus weight technique and you'd love to have a conversation about the benefits of air roasting over barrel roasting, you've found the right place. If you want a sweet tasting coffee they happen to do that as well.  I recommend the honey lavender latte."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pure-bean-rapid-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
