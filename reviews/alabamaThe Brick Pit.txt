Located in a suburban neighborhood area just down from the University of South Alabama, this place hits the spot. I came for lunch on a Tuesday and was not disappointed. Very friendly service and tasty food that is brought to you quickly after you order. The ribs with spicy sauce are amazing. The are not quite fall-off-the-bone style, but very close-make you work for it a little bit-but SO GOOD. The smoky flavor are what made me love them-the best ribs. For sides I got the beans and potato salad. They were out of cole slaw, so I was a little disappointed. The beans hit the spot  though and had meat mixed in with them and had a little kick. The potato salad-just ok. The Finale: the Banana pudding-DO NOT SKIP OUT ON THIS. It was the best I think I've ever tasted.

Unfortunately, upon arrival, they were out of brisket and only had chicken, pulled pork and baked beans (only side left). Our orders came out quickly and we immediately indulged. Before we even had a chance to talk about how great the food was, we immediately ordered more. The sauce was ta-die for, wholly molly Annie Oakley did they hit that on the target. Even though we could have eaten the rest of the meat they had cooking in the back, we  put a halt to the ordering and accepted the fact that we were full.

We shared a combo dinner plate of chicken, pork, and ribs along with potato salad and baked beans. First off, all the meat was cold (off to a bad start). I maybe got two little bites off the rib, the chicken was dry, and the pork had a weird taste/texture to it. Honestly, the only redeeming part of the meal was the baked beans (they were delicious).

My friend ordered the pulled pork (with spicy sauce) and also ordered the same two sides.Baked beans were slightly sweet and smoky at the same time, nice thick consistency.  I'm pretty sure the potato salad had dill in them; they were creamy and delicious.  My spare ribs were rock solid...the meat had to be \"worked\" to get it off the bone (which is EXACTLY how they should be!) yet moist in the mouth. The regular sauce was both sweet and slightly tangy a good accompaniment. The pulled pork was succulent and the spicy sauce on top was just perfect (I liked it more than my sauce choice).We each finished off the meal with a traditional banana pudding filled with real sliced bananas and Nilla wafers.  What a great way to end the meal!  The pit master clearly took pride in what he was doing and the restaurant staff was friendly and helpful (when asked).  A great find...give this place a try!"}, {"review_id": "ridlSJX5IBTndrUTzsh1Kw", "user_id": "nGqkWPQl4ol_6hmML0zHdg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "In my personal opinion, not the best bbq experience I've had in Mobile.

Unfortunately, they were out of the banana pudding so we didn't get to test that out. It's worth the trip to this obviously local spot. Don't let the exterior (a bit of a grimy house in a modest suburban neighborhood) put you off (or the locals hanging out in the next door coffee house).

Hope we just caught them one a very off day given other glowing reviews.Ordered one of each plates (Brisket, Pulled Pork and Chicken)Sausage- came out dried out, but yet still greasy, puzzling. Pulled pork- completely dried out, with a light sweet flavor- this was the most edible of what we got.Chicken- again, it had clearly just been sitting too long. Skin was dried, meat had ok flavor but was dried out too.Sides- just not good- tried beans, slaw, and potato salad. All were left essentially untouched on the plates of everyone in our group.Banana pudding- can't tell you because we never got it. We were in such a rush to just get out of there that we did not even realize we had not received it despite paying for it.Service- staff was friendly, but after we ordered, they were indifferent at best. Again, we were the only people there at this time and staff was more interested in phones and tv than helping.***Aside from the food being less than mediocre, the highlight was the gentlemen (I would assume to be the owner working at a table in back) who ordered Uber eats to have food delivered to the restaurant. I was both offended and jealous of him all in one passing as we left this restaurant.***"}, {"review_id": "hqUdKgsSQ_tPxljCs3I8IA", "user_id": "ypOdDvZqIGilNQ2L2o-eBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/5/2016", "text": "Best BBQ in Mobile.The spicy BBQ sauce is some of the best I have ever had, even in Memphis, Austin, or NC.

The chicken was a breast and wing smoked to perfection with the smoke ring prevalent. The regular sauce was a sweet thick BBQ sauce that was excellent on the chicken but the spicy sauce was just a hit of spices and not heat so \"no\" on the spicy sauce. I tried the pull pork and it was cooked well without the \"I can't over smoke this\" mush that most places served, it still hand a little chew in it.
