We were definitely impressed by Wild Sage. The ambiance the second you walk in is plenty swell enough for me. They have lighted curtains on the windows and cozy seating and I loved it. We made a reservation and were seated immediately. I hear these guys used to be open for lunch and now that it is just dinner people are fiends for this place, so I am glad we may a reservation. Started with the Spokane 74 - because how hilarious is it that this beautiful cocktail was a knock off name of the French 75. Local cheers yo! I had a couple of those throughout the evening and absolutely enjoyed them. My husband had the Bloody Mary and that was tasty too. We started with the tenderloin fondue, YUM! Now as much as I loved this dish the portion size was a tad less than desired for almost $15 per plate. We didn't get very much meat but we did get some type of grilled peach and apple slices that covered the plate a lot too. I just like me some meat, soooo.....We both got a salad and the beet salad I got was incredible. Perfectly roasted and delicious beets that were plated beautifully. Definitely would order this dish again. My husband got the steak and I got the duck breast that I had been craving for a couple weeks so I was so so happy and Spokane 74'ed up ya know. The duck was crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside. Ended with creme brulee and the coconut cake. DELISH. The best creme brulee I have had in this city and my absolute favorite. I am excited I got a coupon (for my husbands birthday) to come have more creme brulee - our server - oh man WHAT WAS HIS NAME HE WAS SO AWESOME! Crap, I really want to tell you guys how awesome he was, darn it. Will edit upon remembering."}, {"review_id": "hCtJKbOeL8BP3GOLYmyiyw", "user_id": "5ev3vFQooMfYEe71ZR2qWA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I'm not sure how this place has such high reviews. It looks nice inside, but the menu reminds me of am inexperienced mom and pop style menu that is attempting to be a high class restaraunt but just doesn't understand how to be one. The atmosphere is lovely. I got a daquri which came out tasting like clorasepric spray and was served as a martini not a daquri. Wild sage Salad was great.  I ordered the pork and it was served rare. I brought it up to the server who told me it is a special kind of pork rthday no matter how long it is cooked will always look rare. I can't comment on the flavor as I refused to eat rare pork. The pork was white on the outside pink then the red/purple look of raw meat in the middle, it was squishy and blood laced juices came out when I pressed on it. The purple Peruvian potatoes were delicous. The flavors of each item we had battled with eachother the entire experience.  I almost think the cook has bad taste buds. The server was really nice and attentive until I said my meat was rare.The check came and they said they took off my pork ($31) however they added $42 worth of extra food and tried to take my card before I reviewed the ticket. The total was $112, then she brings back my ticket and it is corrected and it was still $79."}, {"review_id": "b2_OyZgTXBBPaTwWmoQypA", "user_id": "Ch-mOyFVQeplThH5j6_lgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Great dinner location! I ordered the fondue as well as the bbq pork shank and was amazed by the twist on a classic southern dish. It features fall off the boned tender and well cooked bbq shanks with creamy grits and a tangy bean sauce. The puffy bread which they bring to your table ensures that no sauce is left on the plate. We also ordered the fried polentas which were so crunchy and had the roasted brussel sprouts which had just the right amount of bitterness and creamy taste because of a smooth bechamel sauce.Service is great the food is excellent and best of all the atmosphere is perfect for a great time. I will strongly recommend this place to anyone traveling through or stopping by Spokane!"}, {"review_id": "GmK2TMbb2_UZyrUjp8wFAA", "user_id": "Oczs8WWm45yVWdn6M32h6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Charming ambiance, great service, and perfect for a date night (they also have a lot of great gluten free options)I was lucky enough to go here for a restaurant week meal and it was absolutely wonderful. I had chickpea cakes, romanesco chicken, as well as a creme brûlée with huckleberries. Each dish has brilliant flavor. I finished everything on my plates. Our server (Shelby) was a joy. She provided us with everything we needed to have a wonderful meal. I am told that most of the items I had were on their winter, seasonal menu.

I must say that this is hands down the best restaurant in Spokane. Such a great fine dining experience and excellent service. For Valentine's Day, they scatter rose petals on the table, which adds to the ambiance. What's great is that for reservations, they call you on the day of to confirm the reservation and the restaurant is very organized. We had a table all set up when we got there, which happened to be the exact same table as last year, very cool.I highly recommend them for Valentine's Day, or for any day in fact. The Chateaubriand is their signature dish for Valentine's Day and is not served any other day, and it is a must-have! I also have tried many of the starters and sharing plates, all of which are unique and delicious. They also have a large selection of wine lining the back wall. This place is amazing, but be prepared to spend big here. I don't mind spending more for a good meal, as long as it's once in a while, and at a restaurant that actually delivers quality food and a great experience."}, {"review_id": "CQkD9uBf-yf9IlvXC0tldA", "user_id": "d9s9wcyDRko5ElkskER7iA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "A friend and I chose to treat ourselves out. We have heard that this is a great place to have a pricey and fancy dinner. As a quick synopsis, I will say that the experience was great! From the service, the venue, the atmosphere, the food, and the drinks...I enjoyed it all!Let's get started with the details: Atmosphere: When you look on the outside, the venue looks small and a hole in the wall. When you entered the building, the place looks gorgeous. The lighting set a very romantic but also casual fancy vibe. It does seem like a place you want to dress business casual, but you are more than welcome to go in casual clothes. Furthermore, I would like to say that the feeling of the environment is warm, however if you tend to run cold, then I would recommend bringing a light coat (I.e. cardigan) for inside. Service: The server was on point and was always ready to tend to our needs. Our server provided great recommendations for dishes and drinks. The server was very patient and was very kind. The server was very competent of the food on the menu and shared all the vegetarian options. Food:For dinner, I tried the 3-Course Pre-set menu, which I chose to have the Palouse Chickpea Cakes, Steelhead & Crab, and finishing off with the Creme Brûlée. I also added the wine flight along with the 3-course meal. My friend chose to make her own vegetarian burger and Callebaut Chocolate Hazelnut Tart. As for additional spirits, we ordered the Ruby Sidecar and Spokane 74; which were great recommendations from our server. Here are my thoughts on the dishes and drinks:Palouse Chickpea Cakes (green garbanzo batter, crispy fried, spiced tzatziki, tomato-caper relish) - Absolutely delectable and that tzatziki sauce is absolutely a great pairing to these cakes. I will say that I very much enjoyed it that it could make me a vegetarian. Steelhead & Crab (citrus glazed, warm buttered dungeness crab meat, tomato-caper relish, artichoke-roasted pepper bisque, ancient grains pilaf, blanched broccolini) - The steelhead was cooked to perfection and the crab meat was absolutely perfect with crab meat. In addition, every ingredient.item on the dish was perfect for this dish. I very much would recommend this dish. Palouse Chickpea Burger (green garbanzo patty, melted white Cheddar, pea vine salad, vine ripe tomato) - I had the opportunity to taste the patty and it very much resembled the chickpea cakes. I will say that if the tzatziki sauce was on this burger, it would be just great! Callebaut Chocolate Hazelnut Tart (Caramel sauce, mascarpone-caramel cream, chocolate meringue hazelnuts) - this dessert was rich and very delicious. If you are a chocolate fan, then this is your type of dessert. Creme Brûlée (Also known as \"burnt cream\", brittle caramelized sugar crust, creamy vanilla bean custard, fresh huckleberry compote, pecan lace tuille) - I'm huge Creme Brûlée fan, so I had to taste it. The Creme Brûlée was delicious; especially with the huckleberry compote. The Creme Brûlée is a dish I could not stop eating. If I had not enjoyed every other piece of the meal and was full, then I would probably have more than two of the Creme Brûlée. Ruby Sidecar (House ruby port infused brandy complimented with pomegranate and fresh citrus juice.  Served in a sugar rimmed glass.) - A great recommendation from the server because I told them I was looking for something sweet and refreshing. The sugar rimmed glass was a delight.Spokane 74 (Our take on the famous French 75. House infused rosemary gin, fresh grapefruit and lemon, finished with sparkling wine and a drop of crème de violette) - If you are a gin fan, then this is the drink for you. I very much enjoyed having a taste of this. As my friend, who ordered the drink, did not want to share anymore after one sip (haha). Great drink!Overall, I very much enjoyed the dining experience. If you are looking for a place to treat yourself out or spend a beautiful night with a significant other, I would highly recommend; as long as you are okay with spending a pretty penny."}, {"review_id": "mUx3S_1N6i7yO_NFD4Go0w", "user_id": "Cc9OttXLpiy1-ofiqugteA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So I've always wanted to be a regular at a place and I think this might be my place. The bartender is amazing (Sherice I think?). Great tower drinks and wine pairings. She recommended the Argyle Pinot (which I love) to pair and it was AMAZING!!!!  I'm a totally snob with steaks and how they are cooked and the sides. She recommended it and it was also awesome.And the ice cream of the day is chocolate ganache Carmel they make in house. Are you kid me!  Mind blowing. I cannot say enough. So good. Service amazing.

It's also a really popular spot so make sure to make reservations. My coworker & I made reservations for 7pm and when we arrived, they didn't have our table ready and we had to wait. I found this odd since we had reservations, but all that can be forgiven since our meal was spot-on. THE FOODI got the Chef's Featured Selection of the Week which was the Wild Sockeye & Dungeness Crab. The fish was crispy and seasoned well and the sauces tasted unique and I loved dipping all the things on plate in them to mix it up. My coworker loved her Steelhead and Shrimp with grits as well. We were full but couldn't pass up dessert when we heard they had coconut cream cake. The actual cake was as expected but that sauce on it was a shock of fruity, sour, flavor that made it special. THE AMBIANCEThe place had a modern elegant feel but still comfortable since it's a smaller space. The service when we finally got seated was super friendly. I did notice that the restaurant was full of middle-aged white guys so my table may have stood out a bit, ha! They have a second floor you can reserve for private events and we are definitely looking into it for a group dinner in a couple months. I think my board members would be impressed and I'm so glad a local pointed me here. I'll be back for sure when I'm in the area again and recommend you check it out if you're willing to spend a little more for a good meal!"}, {"review_id": "r6GRLoH12T0GjqtuCRl0tA", "user_id": "907kqSPlCiChQnygYhmQHw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "Food was solid, hits the high standard of quality expected at this price point. Service was exceptional, even for finer dining, and it seems to go to training and retention of great waitstaff as much as getting an awesome server through luck of the draw.I was torn between a couple dinner options and our server gave a really helpful description of both, including notes on flavors that could only come through ample knowledge and experience. He also gave honest answers, which was appreciated over the bland enthusiasm so often paraded out by servers.The meal was good. Overly saucy IMO, but flavors were as deep and complex as James Francos' countenance after catching a shiny object in his gaze.The ambiance is warm and inviting. Loud, but driven by conversation rather than obnoxious music. Plenty of space between tables.

The food is ALWAYS top notch. Yes, it's expensive for Spokane, but it would probably be three times the amount in Seattle. Their menu is constantly changing with the season, trends and I believe the whims of the chef. I've eaten here a number of times with my family for a special occasion and I have never had a bad meal. I have fallen for their purple mashed potatoes and sauteed kale when it's available. Also, be sure to try their delectable coconut cake.One down side: The ladder in the bar is super loud.

It's also a really great place to take family when they come into town. The expanded upstairs is a really nice addition. Yes, it is sometimes a little stiff in there, but on the weekends it can be really nice and more relaxed. I think it's getting better each time I've been as well. The steelhead is an obvious no brainer, as are the popovers. But as any good Spokanite knows, every restaurant has a burger, and the best restaurants have great PNW burgers with all the 'fixins'---  I digress:The burger is really, really good.

For entrees, my boyfriend got the Alaskan halibut which came out on a bed of wild rice. The creaminess of the sauce was delish. I got the Kobe filet with wild mushrooms. That too was delicious.
