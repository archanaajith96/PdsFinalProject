Pork belly and bolgolgi.  The toro is such a thick cut it's so delicious.  The pork belly is very lean which I appreciate so much.  The bulgogi is well marinated but when you cook it kinda falls apart into very small pieces.The mushroom medley is precooked and brought out later.  It is drizzled in butter so it's very soft and tons of umami flavors.Overall we had an excellent experience.  Even though it wasn't all you can eat we were so full and the bill was so reasonable given quality of the meats."}, {"review_id": "Z6SuiZqy4Ug1O-sm2GAkgg", "user_id": "RoDMDTfVioXYELaVW1S6jg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This place was awesome as previous customers recommended.

The Las Vegas combo is $46 and (though for two people) it can definitely feed 3. It comes with tons of meat (best of which is the beef toro), broccoli cheese fondue (amazing combination), bugolgi bimbimbap, house salad and a bunch of small Korean appetizers (fish cake is delicious). The meat came in raw and unlike other Korean bbq places, you gotta do BBQ yourself and it's definitely the fun part. If you can't finish all, you can get it to go. Came on a Sat noon for lunch and the place wasn't super crowded. The service was decent and food came really really fast.

I was SO looking forward to this meal and it was the first stop after leaving the airport to kick off the weekend in Vegas. We arrived at 3pm, so the restaurant was really empty (it can get packed!). The service and the timing for the food was perfect due to the slower time of day we dined. I believe that dining at 3pm def allowed us to have a better experience. Each table is set up with it's own grill and has a hood vent. Although the hood helps, be prepared to still smell like grill when you leave the establishment. We settled on one of the pre-selected bundles 'meat lover'  at $56 for 2 people-which had 6 proteins and an array of salad, soup, and apps. Of course the bonchon side dishes were complimentary and delicious. The best meats in the meat lover set were the beef toro and the flat iron garlic. Both were melt in your mouth delicious. I think the sets are a good way to try more of the menu if you're new to the establishment but when I go back I'll be likely to just order cuts that I love."}, {"review_id": "sceBH18gc3fNVb4DYuKXPA", "user_id": "vf1c4eqpNGweHQqJcjShFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Outstanding, delicious Korean BBQ in Las Vegas!Staff was friendly and accommodating to a group of 30 kids/adults, in town for a soccer tournament.  They were helpful, attentive and offered great suggestions for our food choices.We loved the food...our favorites included:  filet mignon, marinated beef, side dishes and amazing dessert.  We enjoyed cooking at our own table and loved the entire experience!Strongly recommend it for families, groups, etc.  5-star Koren BBQ...worth a visit!"}, {"review_id": "oydJMi0qY3uwvSOBOfLsMA", "user_id": "ZmS1Xv1TENZQGN6pFFFASg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "This place is not cheap but they use high quality meat and you get LOTS of food and I mean LOTS.

Their 6 person set dinner can easily feed 8 adults.  The staff here are very friendly and even though it's a fast pace environment yet staff remain professional and very accommodating.   Their Soju was very good too, so good that almost all the adult in our group had one.Their meat quality is top notch and you get large portions. Oysters were fresh along with their seafood. Their filet cubes was one of the best I've had. If anything the only one that we didn't like was the marinated meat. it wasn't anything spectacular but nonetheless it was still good. The salad was very refreshing and put a good balance with the meat. If you come here, go for the set dinner and order less than you need. If you have six order the 4 person set dinner and get a few appetizers.

I just reviewed my credit card statement and see that they added more to the tip amount I gave them. Apparently they want more tips, so they just add to the charge slip - even though I clearly wrote in the tip amount and accurately added the tip to the total bill due.So people, beware of this activity here. Keep your receipts and check your credit card statements. I do this diligently every month, so this is how I identify fraud.

We got the premium for two. All of the appetizers and complimentary banchan was good except for the oysters. The love oysters and eat them all the time back at home but these oysters did not taste fresh at all. The carpaccio was also amazing. The kobe style beef was the highlight. It literally melted in my mouth. I wanted to keep eating the Kobe all day. The only meat that I didn't enjoy in the set was the galbi and harami miso. I eat galbi regularly but the marinade in both items were too sweet. The shrimp bibimbap was not what i expected at all but it was good. Bibimbap normally has spicy notes to it but this bibimbap was sweet. Overall, it was a great experience. Definitely a good place to try while in Vegas."}, {"review_id": "xdYZjTCnKegnO_HfZpvByg", "user_id": "f_z_JtNybp_0d0eWO75JUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Always a good time!!!

I immediately noticed the banchan (Korean side dishes placed around our table's 2 grills). They had all my favorites ranging from fish cakes, kimchi, cucumbers, macaroni salad...we ended up requesting another round :) My group was starving from our drive into Vegas so naturally our eyes were bigger than our stomachs when we sat down to order. Our plan was to order their prix fix menu enough to feed 10 (2 orders of Gangnam [1 order can serve 2 people for $67]; 3 orders of Meat Lover [1 order can serve 2 for $56/order]). These packages comes with a variety of starter dishes like oysters (by far, my favorite starter), salad, various cuts of meat/BBQ dishes. Our waiter, however, recommended 2 orders of each instead as it is A LOT of food. Good thing we listed because you will NOT leave hungry here. Oysters: I'm usually hesitant about oysters at BBQ dining establishments but surprisingly these were sweet, fresh, not too big/not too small, with green onions, ponzu sauce?, and sriracha I believe. Cuts of meat: they vary from Kalbi, prime rib, filet, pork belly etc. Some were heavily marinated and a bit salty but the flavor profile was on point. Due to long grilling, some cuts came out particularly dry, however, so be careful not to overcook. Overall - I'd definitely come back when I'm back in Vegas. Great for big groups; come hungry and leave happy :)"}, {"review_id": "WFK5GotvSqbXk7Cm7WC9Cw", "user_id": "OmNsMXKfGzXFrByYxsZIQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "I was craving for KBBQ and came across this place after looking for highly rated locations.
