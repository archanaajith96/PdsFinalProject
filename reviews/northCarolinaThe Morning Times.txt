This location provides a good amount of pastries, breakfast/lunch food selections and a diverse amount of coffee. I personally have ordered the breakfast sandwich (eggs, cheese, and choice of meat (i chose sausage)), and always get their iced coffee!Note: It is not as wheelchair friendly as there are steps leading to second floor. However the area where you get all the food and drinks provide an open space, and Morning Times do provide a good amount of open seating outdoors!"}, {"review_id": "GNLjoHSNqAAX06zysJ3W0A", "user_id": "Mcu71vuUJZJgKMbpxrQPTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I've been to Morning Times a few times over the two years I've lived in the Triangle and have never been disappointed. As I was planning my wedding last year, we held a lot of our wedding-related meetings at The Morning Times, as it is also very close to our wedding venue. There is a large seating area upstairs where there has always been available tables no matter what day/time I'm there. Iced chai was always my go-to during these meetings :)I just had lunch there for the first time and it was great. I ordered the Southwest Chicken Wrap, which had good flavor throughout but is a bit spicy. Husband got the Reuben melt, which he enjoyed. I always insist on ordering a baked goods item whenever I'm at a local coffee shop, and chose the Chocolate Chip Cookie this time. It was a thick and full of chocolate chips, just how chocolate chip cookies should be made! Wish I had taken a picture to post! P.S. - from one Yelper to another, life is too short; get yourself that chocolate chip cookie ;)"}, {"review_id": "KInpPsxtpMtzn_hn57Dghg", "user_id": "amFKLthDCZpxiUeDu9Nzsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Yes yes yes yes yes.

I can review this cafe:) I honestly keep forgetting of it each time I'm there. The place is our favorite for long quality conversations. We grab coffee and kiss the store goodbye for the gorgeous outside seating in the heart of downtown Raleigh. Their coffee is solid, consistent and pretty good. I wouldn't say excellent, but good enough. I mean the competition is intense nowadays so it's hard to be outstanding. Urban decor is not my favorite but they did very well with it.Service is ok. People seem to be exhausted by the end of the day. I can't blame them. The food is not appealing to my healthy taste but I guess it suits well the downtown Raleigh customers. Overall, we keep coming back and that's what counts, right?;)"}, {"review_id": "YOSSTVPKeiIP7FBKcXramg", "user_id": "IE_bGVo5udkRsRPSeiKgmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "The good: the biscuit is freshly baked and crumbly. The cheese is on both biscuits and melty..not just on one side. The coffee is flavorful and strong.  I saw someone getting a cappuccino and it looked professionally designed. You are served on actual glass dishes and silverware..no paper or plastic. Delicious!The not so good: There is a spacious upstairs dining area feels like a loft with exposed brick except the noise level when busy is VERY loud.  They need some sort of noise deadening on the walls. I had the lemon bar.  it was a bit dry.  I would come back for the biscuits alone."}, {"review_id": "-qQIloXJ6oU3gvLrrUF9Ig", "user_id": "IjEH1nDo-XGvS7afud_q0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "This is a nice little place.

I've been here for brunch a few times and I stop in for coffee quite often. The food service can be a bit slow during the brunch rush, but I think it's certainly worth the wait. The breakfast burrito here is honestly one of my top hangover cures and they make the BEST pastries and baked goods. The coffee's always good as well. Very consistent flavors and the staff are pretty nice.

I recently visited The Morning Times for an event with the North Carolina Museum of Art my son, Miles passed out flowers to the people downtown (which was an amazing event) I knew that I wanted to go back because I was only able to enjoy some hot chocolate which was great and my son had apple juice which was good too. When I arrived to The Morning Times it was packed with people either ordering breakfast or grab some coffee to go; so I ran up stairs and put my bag down to save myself a seat. I ended up ordering a sausage biscuit which came with cheese and I had them add avocado. They had a nearby stand with Sriracha, so I used that on my sandwich too. Luckily when I went upstairs there was a table open right by the window. I got my food about 10 to 15 mins later and it was so good. I ended talking to guy that brought my food and he was extremely nice. I told him about my son and I passing out flowers and he remembered us which was great. The atmosphere was really cleaned and they seemed to have a good flow of everything. It was really busy and I saw a couple of people trying to find a place a sit. I remember trying to use the WiFi and they either require you to get the code or you have to check in on FB to use their internet. I paid about $8 to $9 which is kind of pricey for a biscuit but I did add avocado. The parking can be crazy if you are trying to get a park in front of the store; it's better to just park in the deck and walk. Overall I enjoyed my experience; I was able to get some work done and enjoy some good food."}, {"review_id": "6MkjXZxR46MkjuM1Vq9Z9g", "user_id": "XvsWPrPcKvNnE03C17mNxA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "This is a really great coffee shop kinda place. We had the breakfast biscuit with sausage and tomato and one of them with avocado which was very good. The sausage was real (not the fake stuff you get at other coffee chains) and the biscuit was fluffy with cheese on BOTH sides! We had the iced chai and a hot coffee. The chai was mediocre (I'm an avid chai drinker) and the hot coffee was good. We also had a lemon bar which was also nothing super special but wasn't bad. Upstairs is very \"aesthetic\" and great for instagram pictures (I'm very guilty).

Other than that, it's just ok. It's also not the cleanest place, overall but I'm guessing that's because all the work is being done downstairs making food and beverages.The space to order is rather tight. With this in mind, I grabbed what was quick - coffee and a small muffin. I got a regular drip and guess I shouldn't be disappointed that it was weak. The maple bacon muffin was tasty because how do you go wrong with bacon?There are a few seats in front of the place, a couple inside on the main floor, and more seating on the second floor. There are a couple tables for larger groups and a bunch of smaller tables that were mostly filled with people punching away on laptops and MacBooks. I stayed to finish my cup and do a little work.
