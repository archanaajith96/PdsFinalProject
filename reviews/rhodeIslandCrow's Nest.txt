They have a nice view of the bay and love their nautical decor. This place definitely gets packed in the evenings and on weekends. There's lots of regulars and elderly people eating there because the food is good!I always get the usual New England clam chowder and any seafood dish pretty much; a favorite for me is the baked stuffed cod, it's super delicious. The service is good, no complaints and our food comes out at a decent time. If you're in the mood for seafood, check this place out. For the non seafood lovers, they have other dishes to choose from too. The parking lot is kind of small, so get there early to get decent parking. Oh and another favorite is the fish and chips! Check it out!"}, {"review_id": "s5_5uwsuYc-V8T6u-b5XYw", "user_id": "qzSJ-wy_emxADUOZ210ABg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "We had the baked seafood platter, veal, key lime pie, and lemon chello pie.  The waiter (Derick) did a great job!!!"}, {"review_id": "wVOxy3-GRS3zIn4sU6euEQ", "user_id": "LD4edJegVZ3xr_wfhMr_aQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "WiFi works.

Very busy but great people, nice rooms and plenty to eat. Our waiter was very busy but still paid attention to us.

We are from New Jersey and wanted a nice seafood place to have dinner, and we were unfamiliar to the area. Upon arrival, the environment already had us in a wonderful mood. Crow's Nest is located right by the marina. The inside of this restaurant was welcoming, nearly spotless, and the staff immediate showed us an incredible level of hospitality. More specially the waitress we had, Charlene F, was so kind and anticipated our needs before we could even ask. She was very friendly and entertaining. The food came out in such a timely manner. My dad's food was only slightly over cooked and before him even realizing Charlene F was right there with a whole new plate from the chef in an effort to correct the issue. We didn't even have to ask! They only wanted to give us the best. I admire their dedication to their professions. This was one of the best meals I have ever had, and I will definitely be coming back here and recommending to all my friends."}, {"review_id": "2ECHN6SxP4lIBSnZvW4jXw", "user_id": "TvYeyc7q3NF8DQj8mYWh9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Went for lunch.  Service was great,  calamari and clam casino great.

I would never had found it without someone giving me directions. I don't there is any signage off of Post Road? So, not sure how people know of this restaurant except for word of mouth. You have to drive onto a side winding road to find the Crow's Nest. I was surprised to find a marina next to the restaurant. There is a lot of activity of big boats and vacationers in the area. The water view is nice too. I had a lobster roll. It was pretty good.  There was huge chunks of lobster meat in my sandwich. I was really surprised. However it's gonna set you back 21 bucks.  We sat at the bar and bartender was very nice and drinks were pretty reasonable.  The clientele was very friendly, a couple of people even bought us drinks.  Decent spot, definitely stirred towards an older local clientele.Thanks"}, {"review_id": "ET32mFgJDiZIUxZ3YwBIFA", "user_id": "qDXrhZFMdNo_SUONthpj0g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "I got the filet and it was so good.

Due to some unique circumstances with the weather as it was the day after a recent nor'easter in New England, we were driving back to Boston from the Mohegan Sun and were looking for a place that had indoor seating and overlooked the water and served Lobster, even though its is off season for lobster. We found the Crow's Nest in Warwick. The food/lobster was excellent and we even had quite a variety of other tempting seafood dishes to choose from. The staff was friendly and brought our orders quickly. We found out afterward, the restaurant was running on generator power as the storm knocked out power to the area the day before which makes the fact the food was fresh, flavorful and warm, drinks were cold and everyone was still smiling, including other patrons. BRAVO!"}, {"review_id": "TcCBVdKkkdwGZSIX5hOftg", "user_id": "88qtmMVPY-hX9lqaBW22Bw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/10/2016", "text": "3 1/2  Stars, not quite 4 stars - it was busy for a Wed night, the parking lot was jam packed! Kind of made my own spot in the lot and hoped my car would still be there when I was finished. =)We were seated pretty quickly at the only empty table in the bar area - I wished she would've asked if we were ok with sitting there b/c it was pretty loud as the bar took up a good portion of the area with seating surrounding it. But in hindsight, we could've refused too - but didn't know how long the wait would be, so just went with the flow. Barflies and other patrons waiting to get seated crowded the bar there so we had to talk loudly to hear one another.As for the food - we ordered calamari for apps, crispy with a nice chew in the inside. Healthy portion served with cocktail sauce and pepper rings. We were also served warm bread buns on the side. Both our entrees came with a side salad - nothing special, typical iceberg lettuce salad. I ordered the swordfish kabob and my gf ordered the shrimp/scallop scampi. We both enjoyed our meals - portions were def well worth the money. My swordfish was cooked very nicely plated over rice and green beans. As we dined, the bar crowd died down a bit and noise level lessened. I would return but would request to sit in the main dining area next time around. The decor of the place is outdated but I think most would say it adds to the charm of the place. Service was good - nothing outstanding but it was sufficient."}, {"review_id": "HeHrO_AEx83nc4cCf6siCQ", "user_id": "vFpb8VrzrXwJuOwQicVNmQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "A big disappointment.

The place was packed so we decided to take out instead. The people at the front desk could not have been nicer and took our takeout order right away.  Two of us got lobster rolls. At $21.50 each, they were good but no better than what I have gotten for $15 to $18 elsewhere. We also took out clam cakes that were okay but could have used more clams in them and clam chowder that was thick and flavorful.  For dessert we took out key lime pie that was a bit creamy and the lime a bit too subtle. The crowd here tends to be older and more laid back...which is not a bad thing in a place this popular. They are on the water but I did not see any outdoor dining. I would definitely give them another try on a less hectic day."}, {"review_id": "_1JeQgLaX9Qf_zXgBEtXOw", "user_id": "Fgvoo8MoORveaKEF1k_k2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "Great spot!

The staff is always extremely polite, the place is always clean and it is always very busy. Stuffed Quahog (clam) is great. They call them \"Stuffies\". It is a load of chopped clams, some breading and some seasoning all baked in a large clam shell. I have tried them plain, with lemon, hot sauce, and with cocktail sauce. I prefer them with the lemon squeezed on them. You can order one or more. Be careful as they are smoking hot when they get to the table. New England Clam Chowder is to die for. Absolutely great. Lobster roll anyone? Take a torpedo roll and cram it till it is way overstuffed with lobster. The roll has a very small amount of lettuce on it, the lobster has a very small amount or celery and mayo. This sandwich is all about the lobster. Huge hunks on top of huge hunks. I end up here 1-3 times annually with 1-3 people in tow and it never changes.
