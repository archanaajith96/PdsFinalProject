Kale, sausage and egg scramble with cheese and rosemary was out of this world! People rave about the maple biscuits. We thought they were good but would have been perfection had they been warmed up a bit. Service was odd. Person at register just pointed at things or shifted her gaze to indicate where things were.

Small! I ordered the avocado sandwich and to say it was lackluster doesn't even begin to describe it. I was so disappointed. On top of that, the service was perfunctory and bordered on rude.

THE MAPLE BISCUIT!!!!!!!While just casually walking in to see what this spot had, I noticed there was one single maple syrup biscuit in their display. Immediately these are the thoughts that went through my head:1) \"Damn. I love biscuits.\" 2) \"Maple biscuits sounds even better.\" 3) \"Crap. There's only one biscuit left.\" 4) \"If someone takes that biscuit, I'm gonna cry.\"Was it worth all the turmoil? You bet. Sweet. Delectable. Flaky.

I've had breakfast here two days in a row. I had the avocado toast, blue berry muffin, ham and cheese scone, and croissant. They were all delicious but the blue berry muffin and ham and cheese scone were the items that stood at the most! They were beyond mouth watering.

Get it on the biscuit- it's amazing and adds a slight sweetness! The sandwich is huge and very filling. My sister ordered a sausage scramble. Unfortunately there wasn't much egg compared to sausage and potatoes (she really wanted eggs). Other than the lack of eggs, no complaints. We ordered home fries to split (small) which was very large and unimpressive. The potatoes were hardly cooked (still pretty hard) and didn't have much taste.

I'm going to go ahead and assume the cafe title is tacked on to inform patrons that there is caffeine served here in some form or another (read: mediocre espresso drinks). The salad.... well, it was some sliced deli meat and cheese rolled up into a roll, placed awkwardly on top of a salad. Not sure exactly what the deal was there, was I supposed to realize that's what \"turkey\" meant?The sandwich was phenomenal (curried chicken salad), and the bakery smelled like a little slice of heaven.
