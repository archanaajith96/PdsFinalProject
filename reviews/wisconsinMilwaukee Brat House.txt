This spot was close to our hotel, and we wanted some brats so why not.    Kind of a dive bar vibe but on gameday/happy hour the the place was getting packed. Had no idea it was 2-1 beers which is awesome. Got the sausage flight, and cheese curds, soo good!! Might have been some of the best brats I had in Milwaukee! Best part they have a free shuttle every 20 mins to Miller Park!! Beers, Brats, Cheese curds and free shuttle to the game, you can't beat that. Will deff come back here next time I'm in Milwaukee."}, {"review_id": "jj3QyBrWAiWFvc3RDaz6pQ", "user_id": "xBqn1EyblQBPrCpSL_iu1A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Very nice individuals.Really dark inside. Was unsure if this was intended or undercooked, but the shell of the brat was abnormally easy to bite into. It wasn't bad it just threw me off.Cheese curds were good and I loved being able to substitute them for $3. The brat didn't have a ton of flavor, until I hit the onions and mushrooms, so I'd recommend the chefs ensuring an even spread or tossing more spices in the brats. Root beer is made by point burgers but tastes diet.Definitely not a bad experience, but definitely not my favorite."}, {"review_id": "MtXhXuWA_LXckJ99dj6ddw", "user_id": "lOvuUhY1_ujlT6uNW3u0AA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "it's again a shotgun bar along north old world third which is great for a pre post game bite or drink. What sets it apart (in my opinion) is the great affordable bar food. The star of the show is of course brats and sausage, with a nice side of cheese curds. You can easily get a meal for under $10 and they also have lots of happy hour specials. The bar itself is historic  (looking, at least)  Pressed tin ceiling,  old school stained glass beer signs and lots o wood round out the place.  There's also an upstairs and a patio  (in seasonable weather) out back. Only thing to keep in mind-  they have lots of tvs and music playing downstairs and either that reason or that aforementioned tin ceiling made it impossible to get a decent cell phone signal. but, still a fan!"}, {"review_id": "tsEPE5PDfrzonR-XpzdtEg", "user_id": "JuTNpBtxh80AqTE5z9NSPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Love the brats at brat house. I almost always get the brat sampler which comes with 4 sausages - polish, Italian, bratwurst and xxx Hungarian. Yes that xxx stands for triple hot. I like spicy but this sausage is even too much for me. You can substitute any other sausage which is what I do. Each sausage comes sitting on appropriate garnish  ie kraut, red pepper with tomato sauce, grilled onions. And there's a lovely pretzel bun to share (or not). I like sitting upstairs with the nice view out front. Lots of taps to choose from and friendly staff too!Cheese curds are tasty and always my go to add on to the sausage platter. It's crazy fun on the weekends and a great spot to go before or after a Bucks game."}, {"review_id": "_o_rZ03CaOsSxpJU26Jv1Q", "user_id": "dJ8UNl_5pGiAp4IXou1owA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "This is one my favorite places in downtown Milwaukee. The loaded tator tots are definitely a signature dish and is a MUST have when you come. Fully loaded is a generous term here but you will love it. The south-sider Brat is also one of my favorites. It's a little messy when you pick it up, but you won't mind after you take your first bite."}, {"review_id": "qjXhveZFDMIlRZ5FTIWUXA", "user_id": "XXQujYqgH5hXo7uYu8_1hw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "If you are looking for a bar where the locals go, check this place out!Walked right in and sat at an open booth on a Wednesday night (luckily there was a game downtown that night!) They were wrapping up trivia so I bet it can get pretty busy. There is street parking out front but again, it can get pretty busy.We ordered The Miltown and added sauerkraut on the side. For the side with the meal we were debating on tots or curds and it came down to the curds being a great  option via our server :) The service was excellent and our food was out in 10 minutes. The reason for my average rating is the taste of the food alone. The brat was just \"ok\" and had overpowered beer flavor (I love beer but it was a bit much) and the curds lacked flavor in the breading and some were cold. Also, for some reason the meat was super soft...not a firm snap that I was accustomed to....Overall we spent less than $15 out the door and enjoyed the service but Ill most likely go somewhere else for a brat and curds next time I am in town."}, {"review_id": "IXZJojJSll5NM0BSRUaYUg", "user_id": "521Dv66j45_zcikFETJS0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Bartender was a cool cat, & the food was great!  Brats manufactured literally across the street.  I had the farwell specialty brat and cheese curds, absolutely fantastic!"}, {"review_id": "ABXKBYHU9jQ3FHPiBZVf4g", "user_id": "NUa3uTpX-sT4ylUVqaTz9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "I wrote before about fancy people watching. That's fun, but on the opposite side of the Sunday spectrum there's this. They do have a brunch menu, but they excel more as a place to watch a game. These are not fancy people. They are people who want to grab a beer or some food or maybe watch a game. It's not so much a \"see-and-be-seen\" place, which I really kind of prefer.It can get raucous if it's crowded. It does get crowded on weekend nights sometimes. As a single lady, I've gotten flirted with, but not in the blatantly obnoxious way I've seen at other places in the area. It's more of a laid-back bar.I have had to wait for service, but the food is good. The tap beers come in two glasses. I've seen a guy get kind of mad about that because he was standing and didn't want to hold two glasses. That's really kind of understandable, and the bartender poured them into one glass for him (also showing that it's the same amount of beer as would be in a regular glass) but he was still mad. You can't win them all I guess.I like the \"outlaw\" vibe. I'll probably keep coming back."}, {"review_id": "P1GmKb_1-bkmOrcaT4FLWA", "user_id": "Q8WcAyyViQhJwBjymxy8Nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "We came in looking for something local for lunch, and in foul moods after our last attempt at lunch at a tourist trap. We were immediately seated, and our waiter was Johnny-on-the-Spot with answers to our questions, and recommendations. The giant pretzel is truly massive, needing a pizza box to bring it to the table. The bratwurst comes from a famous local vendor across the street, and the beer is blue collar's best. Definitely a 5 star place, with tasty food and the best service I've had this trip.

So when my friend was visiting Milwaukee and I came up to meet her and had to pretend that I actually know how to give a tour of Milwaukee, I decided this would be a good place for dinner. Luckily, my memory served me well and we had a delicious dinner and a good time.We sat outside. The patio is on the sidewalk and close to the street, but it wasn't too busy on a Tuesday night. We were informed they had a $2 Sausage special, so we took advantage of that.We ordered Authentic Wisconsin Cheese Curds to split and got the 2 glasses of Spotted Cow each. My friend went with The Miltown sausage and I got a Polish Sausage with Sauteed Onions, Sauteed Red Peppers and Cheddar. We tried to make it healthier by going with Garden Salads for our sides.I loved my Sausage, though I wish it would have been heftier to fill up more of the bun. Still, you can't really complain too much when it's only $2 and a little bit more for the added toppings I got. I'd have been fine paying full price for what we got, though I'd likely have gone with the Hungarian Spicy Sausage (not included in the special). I would also get the Brat House Jumbo Bavarian Pretzel next time because the table next to us ordered it and it looked fantastic!Our server was pretty attentive without being bothersome. She checked on us a few times and refilled our water glasses when needed."}, {"review_id": "qbNGfMXOivebyHWYRiZtZA", "user_id": "HoKm001BxwiyDIBVmzX-Jg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Pretty good food.
