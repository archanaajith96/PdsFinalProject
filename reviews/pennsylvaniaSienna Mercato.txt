It's great for happy hour, family get togethers and casual date nights. I love that you can put yourself on the wait list too, because it can get super busy on the weekends.I was so happy to hear that they were gluten free friendly, considering this was a fave spot pre-celiac diagnosis. The only meatball you can get gluten free is chicken. I'm wondering why that is though? Let me be clear, I'm appreciative, but I wonder if it's harder to do the beef meatballs gluten free for some reason? Anyway, also happy to see the fries and tots are gluten free. That's not always the case because they're fried in the same frier as glutenous items usually. I honestly don't think I've had fries since I was diagnosed, and they were delicious! I was bummed to see Auroch's gluten free beer isn't on the menu here. I saw they were mentioned on IG as being at Mercato. I asked our server and she was like, no we don't have it, and walked away. I went to the bar to double check and they mentioned it was probably their other location, which I forgot about. So here's a plea to carry Auroch's downtown too!?Glad this can still be a dependable option while downtown!"}, {"review_id": "3jF7WoHm8Z7Di0xtW42q3w", "user_id": "LaiylSIbrA3aPvOYtl-J4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "One of the best parts of a restaurant is consistency and Sienna Mercato nails it every time. I have visited Emporio (the meatball joint) and Il Tetto (the rooftop beer garden) several times and all of my experiences have been wonderful! Emporio is a wonderful place to bring guests of all ages because the unique concept is something fun that anyone can get behind! I've tried tons of varieties of meatballs/sauces/serving styles and I've never been disappointed! Beware: the meatballs are big and your eyes may be bigger than your stomach! Il Tetto is a great place for a night out! There's a lot of awesome beverage choices and you can't beat the atmosphere. Even on a rainy night, you can still see the burgh's tallest buildings standing tall. Located right on Penn in the heart of the cultural District, there's nothing not to love about Sienna Mercato."}, {"review_id": "I6R8Jib_BKYKtQD8o-QQsw", "user_id": "hkbdFon8SH0SfAYMwNQvZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Sat at the bar and had the traditional beef meatballs, penne pasta with meat sauce.

They also serve a poutine that is on par with some places in Toronto. I'm also impressed by their selection of draft beers -- I was excited to find that they sometimes feature the watermelon beer from 21st Amendment. The meatballs, however, are a bit dry and poorly seasoned. They are also soaked in sauces that taste excessively sour and sweet. In fact, it is often hard to discern one type of meatball from another. I've tried their meatballs in a salad, on a sandwich, or by themselves and I can't say that I look forward to eating them.Although it's a great place to grab a drink in downtown, I wouldn't recommend having a meal here."}, {"review_id": "oyTjU9rID0AQ98TXhZwZfQ", "user_id": "KKblXUNxSGCewpDxiiSRQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "The idea and layout of this restaurant is what makes it so interesting. There are 3 floors, bottom serves their famous meatballs, floor 2 serves additional italian meals, and the top floor is a rooftop beer garden. We chose the bottom floor and ordered meatballs. On the menu, you choose the number of meatballs, the meat type (ask what the monthly special is, you'll find an interesting new flavor), the sauce to put on the meatballs, and lastly what side they should go with. The sauces and sides range depending on your preferred taste. You can have sweet or spicy, and add traditional pasta noodles or go outside of the box with tater tots. I ordered the Loaded Baked Potato and really enjoyed it, truly a perfect comfort food. This included classic beef meat balls, white cheddar mashed potatoes, tater tots, american cheese, bacon, and scallions. While the bowl only includes 2 meat balls, I was full about 3/4 the way through my meal and took the rest to go. Meals are a bit on the pricey side for meatballs but the unique idea and atmosphere of this restaurant are worth checking it out."}, {"review_id": "lmMmJfthOzYJGr4YYFkG1A", "user_id": "bmSuFvdMyF66PDUZr9VfoQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "Service was good and quick. It is a little noisy ambience. The place is neat and we were seated immediately. We first went to the rooftop bar first while waiting for the other people in the group to arrive. It is a fun environment and I highly recommend it if you are looking for an outdoor experience in the middle of downtown sorrounded by tall buildings.This definitely looked like a great place with very good reviews and the group I went with enjoyed the food. However, I didn't really like the food. Part of the reason is the trouble I had with ordering the food since I am neither a meat ball not a pasta person. So, it was not easy for me to find a dish I could order. I ended up ordering poutine with tater tots and fried egg. The egg was delicious. I liked the tater tots, but i hope I had asked them to add less cheese. I might go back to this place and try something else next time."}, {"review_id": "OMGMC7cxOBYLM1ZjmbjfnQ", "user_id": "bcf5X_2LTrCw-s4YPsCmKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "If you're in the mood for a 'cheat day', this is the place to go.

I went with the server recommendation and she got me 2 meatballs with the tomato risotto. I loved it! For the price the quantity and quality was great! My date and I both were really happy being fed here. Also, the decor is so cute they do have a rooftop beer garden that's open on certain days.

The place was busy and service there was friendly but slow. All in all a good place to go for food and drinks with killer service downstairs. Give Jordan a raise!!!!Visit two was awesome.

I've never tried chili with spaghetti or even with chicken balls. But it was a pleasant surprise. The texture of the chicken balls aren't as put together and thick as meatballs normally would be but still delicious. My friend and I split the poutine which we ordered with house cut fries and bacon bits sprinkled on top. We were able to choose a sauce and we got the Crack Sauce. Yes, you read it right haha. And I knew exactly why when I first tried it. It's a mixture of ranch and hot sauce, and it was just as tasty and addicting as its name implies. Lastly, my friend ordered the Fuggetta-Bowl-It! This is one of its popular dishes. It's a creamy Parmesan spaghetti with classic beef meatballs in meat sauce and shaved Parmesan on top. I don't think you can ever be disappointed by the classic spaghetti and meatballs. The only thing that I thought was a little off for my taste was that the meatball in this dish tasted much saltier than my meatballs. But the weird thing was that my friend was saying the exact opposite of my reaction... don't know how that happened haha. The food is a bit pricey and salty so I'd give it a 4/5. The service was good and the space is really big so I don't think seating would be a problem, since this place has 3 floors.I'd definitely want to check out the rooftop bar next time!"}, {"review_id": "YW5WkRLrKSYJP4f60hPGCg", "user_id": "mYJW4-M4tcRygSwdT3A6Ww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/18/2017", "text": "Sienna Mercato is always one of my go to spots. Whether it's for happy hour, dinner or late night drinks on a Saturday night. It has so much going for it really, il tetto and mezzo and MEATBALLS. I've been to all three establishments and love them all! I can honestly say for how busy they get, I have never had an issue with bad service and that's a big deal. On my most recent visit, I ordered the ground chicken meatballs with the crack sauce (hot sauce and ranch). That took everything to the next level. You get 4 balls and they make it extra saucy which I love. If you want to throw a side of tater tots in that will be an additional charge so make note of that."}, {"review_id": "23hZ4clkz3bfM0G81cRk_g", "user_id": "Fd3GvZTer-2_EwMzL3ptAg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2017", "text": "I'd scoped this place out on the weekend as a spot to check out for dinner with my work team and we had a great night out! Service was wonderful and both the Maitre'd plus wait staff were wonderful!I decided to make my own bowl of meatballs and tried x2 veggies, 1 chicken as 1 Pork with basil sauce and spaghetti. I think that was too heavy for me as next time I might try it as a meatball sub and also hopefully get some greens at the same time! One one of my co-workers got the sautéed Brussels Sprouts - I found these to be well cooked but unfortunately they tasted bitter to me as well.For dessert, our table of 11 got the beignets plus the red velvet cake mini- donuts. For me the clear Winn was the beignets - I could have licked clean the accompanying bowl of chocolate sauce! In contrast the red velvet tasted a bit heavy and stodgy.Overall a brilliantly good night out - I'm now anxious to try out the food on Floors #2 and #3!Yelp Review 57/2017"}, {"review_id": "nNDo1v1_dwCWE6f0qwX7iQ", "user_id": "SNPn3lbLkiSFmyGYWmkMiA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "The roof bar is great, and I will keep going back for that.

We got the arugula salad, the seafood pasta and for dessert the peanut butter and chocolate terrine. We also go the butchers meat charcuterie. We also decided to get a second dessert-the name which I forget-but was like a brownie soufflé! Everything was SO delicious! My only complaint was one of the workers who kept coming by too often trying to take plates away before we even finished eating. By the third time she came by, when we hesitated to hand over our meals which we were still eating, she made an annoyed face! Finally we decided to give up and just give her our half eaten plates.

My boyfriend had beef meatballs, provolone, and marinara sauce. We loved our meals! We also shared tater tots and the Parmesan-herb fries.
