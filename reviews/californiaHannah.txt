I ordered the red velvet and chocolate lovers and they were absolutely tasty. They were pure perfection in terms of the moistness and sweetness. I also had the mango smoothie which was good. It space is a little small-ish in size but it has a lot of outside seating and is very cute. The servers were very nice and friendly and the meal items came out on time. I highly recommend and I'll be back for those cupcakes :-)"}, {"review_id": "ulDXqOFpGAB1e40mT58Q7A", "user_id": "T6iHpSSqu631Qu-87mQqSg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "This place is horrible!  I came here because of the good reviews -1 hr drive away and is extremely disappointed!  I brought like 3 people here and a baby.  First of all, how does a cafe not have a restroom for their customers?! Poor baby, had to suffer not being able to be changedDown to the most important stuff, drinks taste very bland and watered down.  Coffee is the same. Red velvet cupcake tasted pretty dry (icing was fresh-strong contrast from the dry cake)We got three drinks and put it in the big cups instead of my warm tumbler so that theres more room for art.  I told the guy i want to get a unicorn.  He said \"we don't take requests but we try our best\". Ok ill take his word.The other two cups came out with pictures .  Although i ordered mine first and is the one that actually requested art i got a piece of garbage for art and cold latte... So no more coming here again or recommending anyone here.  Bad choice.  Bad experience.  No art.  Disappointed.  Workers also taking trash out right next to us.  Gross.  That should done after shop closes. Overall, we spent too much money here.  Id rather go elsewhere for better experience.  Not recommended by me to come here."}, {"review_id": "djo-BehpGN6jE2PD0qHoOA", "user_id": "filR0kQf8cNJGkLP7tCBFg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This is a bakery/foodie/coffee spot on the dowtown facing part of alameda kinda sorta within walking distance of diridon station.There's a parking lot in back for about thirty , but a lot of people use the street parking especially in the mornings.There is both inside and outside seating. The outside seating is heavy on picnic style thingys which are perfect when you are with smaller children. No need to wrestle that stroller inside, but there's a couple of patio style chair/table combos as well. The inside space is tiny and will feel cramped  even if it's half empty. There is a variety of seating inside-some table/chair/bench stuff, and a few counter style spots. There's also usually a couple of chairs aroung for sitting in while waiting for that to go order, if you need an extra spot at your table or just for overflow seating. You can eat a meal (or a cuppa) here more or less comfortably, but this may not be the best spot to hang out for hours over coffee.This is sort of an all in one place. They do a mean cuppa coffee and/or tea, a nice selection of iced and/or blended drinks, bake their own pastries (the cupcakes are superior) and run a cafe style menu. While it's a great spot for a cuppa i actually like the food. Yeah the coffee's great but those wraps are epic. Daily soups and sandwhich thingys are consistently good as well.Service is of the order and counter and pick up when called methodology and short lines are not uncommon. While things move along fast enough, this may not be the best choice for a time limited lunch. Pricing is on the higher side. Those wraps i love so much will be in the 13-15 dollar range. Adding a drink will put you back twenty. There is a pastry happy hour-half off whatever is left-in the afternoons but you will still be looking at a five to seven dollar (depending on choices made) cup of caffeine and a sweet. All in all however whatever flaws the place has-limited seating, small space etc. this remains an excellent coffee and cafe spot due to the superior prep of the menu."}, {"review_id": "Qdo-OwMMTSbjUD-aj-fB6g", "user_id": "D-yGVfdFKhDsgXZXBnygGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "I'm always looking to try the next cool coffee spot in town. I try and find places that stand out and of course have great reviews.I love coffee and appreciate coffee shops that go the extra mile to get me in the door. After looking at the photos and reviews of Hannah's I decided to give them a try for brunch today. It was a foggy morning so I was hoping that would work in my favor of the brunch rush. My roommate and I went over around 10ish am and it was midly busy. The waiting counter area is a little tight so it might be hard to read the food menu and drink menu the same time. They may have had tangible menus but I may have not seen them. Since I scoped out the food online I already knew what I wanted!When it was my turn to order I asked if every drink came with art work, one of the reasons I came. She said yes and I wasn't disappointed when I got it. I ordered the Almond Roca latte and the green eggs and ham brekky sando. My drink came out first and my sandwich a few moments later.My roommate and I were able to find a seat at one of the large picnic type table outside, big enough for two pairs of people to share.This place is dog friendly and even has treats for them at the food pickup bar. If you spend $15 or more and check-in on Yelp you get a free cupcake! I highly recommend this place, delicious food, great coffee and coffee art and a friendly staff.

I was slightly underwhelmed. Pros: Decent food, quietCons: Not much seating, coffee isn't greatBoth the chai latte and the hazelnut latte we ordered were meh. We were lucky to be there on a quiet Monday morning - I know that if we were here on a weekend, I'm sure we would not be able to find seating. While I wouldn't recommend Hannah for its coffee, I can tell that it puts a good emphasis on its pastries and food in general. It's a nice place to sit and eat/drink, do work or maybe read a book (if you're there at the right time).

I came on an early afternoon and saw hand crafted drinks come out every minute.I ordered a hazelnut latte in house and the barista crafted a bicycle on top lol! We were talking about bikes after I ordered so it was nice that they incorporate your conversations in your drinks. Certainly brought a smile to my face.Awesome drinks and awesome baristas.

Almond rocca latte was recommended. Then, I showed Dragonair picture on Yelp. Glad they made it and I liked it.

SO PERFECT!I ordered the salmon lox sandwich. You can pick whatever type of bread you want it on, and I choose a croissant (the bagel looked good, too). I also ordered a small vanilla latte with soy milk. The small was so big! The food was made to order, came out quickly and service was great. The only downside is the place isn't huge but we found seats outside. We also took advantage of the free cupcake with check in. The banana Nutella cupcake is divine! It's more like a banana bread muffin but so so good. I will definitely get that next time.Parking is interesting--30 minute parking spots all around but if you drive up the street a bit you'll find something. It's right across from the Whole Foods.

Each cupcake cost $3.50 and if you check in on Yelp, you get a free cupcake if you spend $15. So I got their Almond Rocca latte which was around $4.35 (Medium cup). I also got the carrot, sweet brown butter, banana Nutella, salted caramel and red velvet cupcakes. I got them as gifts so I wasn't able to try them but the latte was really good! I didn't expect it to be sweet at all but it was on the sweeter side and it wasn't bitter like other lattes. And the café art was super cute! If you want the cupcakes for a discounted price, come Mon-Fri from 2-3pm for buy 3 cupcakes, get 1 free. Overall, this café is super cute with plenty of street parking and a private lot in the back.

They replaced it with a new one though :) 2. they've forgotten to put chocolate powder in my boyfriend's mocha. When I went back to tell the barista I think she forgot the chocolate, she was kinda rude (said she'd make us a new one in an exasperated voice) because she thought I was just being picky and I was kinda taken aback. I even thought I was mistaken. But when I went back to pick up the new one, she told me she realized that she forgot to put the chocolate... I wasn't offended but it wasn't the best of experiences.
