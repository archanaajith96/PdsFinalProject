Waterfront view is nice and they were very accommodating about our reservation request to be by the window. Not too loud.They have a separate gluten free menu (and vegetarian menu on the other side). Most of fresh catches and many sides are gluten free. Made the experience easy and safe.Delicious fresh food and good sides. Cocktails seemed quite tropical/sweet, so we stuck to wine.The reservations seem to fill up and even before 6 on a Tuesday, there was a 40 min wait. So ideally a reservation would help!"}, {"review_id": "bjksjNvXHRz4fscGQnTLHg", "user_id": "dXCcQD7RyStWmmG-8hkiPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "We took my mom here for lunch the other day. I love the location and the view. Also it's one of the few restaurants in downtown Charleston with free parking. I had the fried shrimp, acre peas, and fries. It was all good!  My mom had fried oysters, fries and cold slaw. She really enjoyed it. I have also been here for dinner. The food and service was good then too.

They have one of the best views in town and one of the only options for true waterfront dining here in Charleston. I am always surprised by their specials and often have to ask what the stuff is! LoLParking is easily available just down the street in a paid lot. I don't recommend trying to pull into the actual restaurant parking lot as it is rather tight and almost alway full. I also had a friend threatened to be towed from their lot after leaving her car there after a night of drinking.Some of my favorites off the menu are the she crab soup and whatever fresh fish they have. If your from MD I wouldn't recommend getting the crab cake.

With that being said,  because of my wife there's not been a time we've visited the market area without stopping here for a bite to eat.  When I say this, over the years we've traveled to Charleston from Wisconsin 7-8 different times. The restaurant is located right on the waterfront with seating available on the outside wrap around deck area.  The immediate area surrounding the restaurant is quite run down and for the amount of money this place has to take in I can not believe they haven't invested in improvements.  I  believe or hope it is due to the historic area and they are unable to secure the proper permits to do so.This is a touristy area and I'm sure that's likely what the place caters to.  They do have a significant seafood selection and the food experience is enjoyable.  The bar area has a wide array of specialty drinks with my wife most often choosing some type of mint julip mojito.The food/drink prices are probably slightly above average but no where near out of line for the vicinity. The servers have always been friendly and any wait usually goes by pretty quick.  (You can eat at the bar if you find open seats).  As I indicated it's one of my wifes favorite spots in the area.  So much so that we've stopped each time we've been through in the last 10+ years. The restaurant has maintained a similar consistency through the entire time period."}, {"review_id": "PYNq7HhHLUKOey7kJxNtbQ", "user_id": "x_Frpa8QWc25FDJ5BJM8tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "They have a parking lot in Downtown Charleston which is incredible! However, this restaurant is packed and we had about a 50 minute wait.We had the She Crab Soup with Blue Crab Roe & Sherry, Crispy Whole Fried Southern Flounder with Apricot Glaze with the vegetable of the day and Charleston red rice, and Seared Scallops with two sides (I chose green beans and garlic mashed potatoes). Everything was delicious. The whole flounder was actually cheaper than the scallops, so probably a better deal.My friend asked for coleslaw instead of the collard greens, which were the vegetable of the day. Our waitress said sure, but messed up the order by substituting coleslaw for the red rice instead. Once we told her, she quickly made up for it though, bringing us another side of red rice for no extra cost."}, {"review_id": "PWMPayZ55YGstQD-B9Ln5g", "user_id": "jv7eIqEoEPBXVhcJoYwmyw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "The view and location is enough to keep going back! I definitely recommend a reservation at any point of the day. We did not have one for dinner (2 of us), but showed up right at 5pm and only had to wait about 15 mins for a table. The calamari was some of the best I have had. I ordered the scallops and was surprised how many came with my order! They were delightful. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable on the menu, and offered great recommendations. I did not care for the side of rice at all.

I would also say that when a ship is not in the way, the view of the ocean is really nice, especially if you score a table in the outer area of the dining room. Again, IF you get a table. Sunny days, like it was during my visit, the wait is very long. The bar is FCFS, and we managed to grab seats after standing a short while. The bar servers are very busy but managed to stay on top of drinks and food. Dining experience - we ordered the calamari which was so fresh and the two sauces served with it are great. I really enjoyed that. The shrimped stuffed hush puppies were also delicious and would definitely recommend. I shared the fish sandwich and it was a tad disappointing. After having had great appetizers, I was really wanting the sandwich to not be so lack luster, but the French fries were thin crispy and fun to eat. Overall, would I go back, yes but with so many other options, I am not sure I would immediately return. Cheers to the bar tenders though for being so attentive."}, {"review_id": "PDqcztDiW4qdd_IsTvP-ew", "user_id": "beVixHLibJYSKvX1yiXrhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Great food , and great service. I was invited by my son and daughter in law for my post birthday luncheon and felt that we couldn't have selected a better location. We sat outside on the patio. The weather was pleasant, the skies were blue, and the scenery being situated right on the water, with a great view of the waterfront park, and there was a carnival cruise liner docked at the port (the port is next door restaurant). The food was fresh, the seasoning wasn't overpowering, and the service was great.  The parking is complex and the lot is small.  We went at 2:30 shortly before they close to prepare for dinner, so there were two parking spaces remaining when I pulled in.  The drinks weren't the best.  I ordered a mimosa and there wasn't enough OJ.

The restaurant was packed when we went in for lunch on a weekday. It was a Wednesday, but also was probably due to the spring break rush. We had to wait 39 mins for a table for three, which wasn't too bad considering the long line out the door. However, I do wish that the bar had more seating to accommodate guests who were waiting to be seated. Food was standard Charleston Fair. I had the fried shrimp platter and it was good, but nothing to write home about. As an appetizer, we tried the stuffed hush puppies and they were definitely worth it! Highly recommend.

The restaurant itself was pretty boring looking but has a view out to the ocean. The seating outside was comfortable and the staff was friendly.The food and drink is a little expensive for what you get. The lunch servings are tiny, but the food looks like it was mostly made from scratch. I got the ice-berg wedge salad which is exactly as it sounds- a head of lettuce cut in half with a tasty dressing and some bacon bits ontop.

Why? Location, Location, Location! The restaurant is located in a wonderful spot overlooking the Charleston Harbor right in the heart of downtown, and parking is a plenty with the parking garage right across the street. Fleet is the perfect place to watch the sun set over the harbor while enjoying a cocktail or dinner. I wouldn't say the food is all that spectacular, but the Fleet Landing Stuffed Hush Puppies are! They are giant balls of breading Filled with lobster, shrimp, leeks, & corn over Creole Tomato Sauce. Service at Fleet isn't all that great, but it's ok; better than some and worst than some. It's just really slow service and they have never seemed to be in a rush. As far as value I think you get what you pay for, so while the food isn't top chef Charleston quality; it is good and it is very affordable.
