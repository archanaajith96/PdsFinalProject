Then I realized people already know about this place and love it as much as I do! I will admit the space is a little small but I think that helps with the cozy feel of the bar. The bar area is a little tight but I always head right to the back where there are cozy chairs and sofas to make it feel like your at your besties house having a drink. Jeff also adds to the at home feel. Hes the owner of the bar and also super friendly and helpful. He of course is super knowledgeable about everything they serve and always offers up a taste of his signature dessert. I also am very fond of the stories I get to hear every time I visit. Now on to the good stuff, what you came here for. The drinks are great! Wednesdays are wine night and you can get any bottle on the menu for $18 which is awesome. Their cocktail menu is great and if you dont see anything you want you can ask them to make you at bicycle clown and they will personalize a drink just for you! As far as food everything ive had is great but my absolute favorite is the charcuterie board. It always comes with at least three cheeses, seasonal fruits and meats including the best pulled pork ive ever had! I also could exist alone on just the rosemary popcorn that is complementary the moment you walk in. I easily eat three bowls every time i visit rather its for dinner or just drinks. Overall i encourage people to check it out, just not when i want to go enjoy the sofa area lol."}, {"review_id": "labdBxxTbGX2B3Bg7G23JA", "user_id": "UgYi68PFYWqOjY0Eb_wZGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "I finally made it here and I loved it! My friends have raved about this place forever! Now that I've experienced it first hand, I'm sold too. If I lived in the area this would be my regular spot. Jeff is great and he's got a story for everything. He has a way of making every customer feel special. I love the cozy atmosphere. It feels like you're in a good friends home, especially with the comfy (and stylish) sofas in back.I could have easily noshed on the rosemary popcorn all night, but we ordered the charcuterie and completely indulged. It was all delicious! Smoked Gouda with bacon, porter cheddar cheese, brie, kiwi, oranges, watermelon, blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, cured meats, pate, mustard, jalapeno aioli, cool ranch Doritos, pulled pork, pickle, and fresh baked bread with orange marmalade. All the details were spot on! Next to The Elephant the pate was one of the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot in an attempt to \"like\" it)! The pulled pork was sweet and smoky. Jeff brought us some nutella spoon bread (the house special dessert). I'm not a chocolate eater but, if you are you'll enjoy it. The cured meats were perfectly curated to accompany the cheeses we had. It was a marriage of salty, sweet, umami, and tart. Just divine!Wednesday is wine and you can get an $18 bottle. . Can't wait to go back and try a cocktail!"}, {"review_id": "Q8VCps5jxZShMvIoGfsUVg", "user_id": "DihTsliUxbqpoA9W3uRDBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "Don't let the funky cocktail names scare you. The handcrafted cocktails at Bar Liquorice are legit. Service is great too, so I can see why this place was packed on a Saturday night. It's pretty small (long bar area and tiny back room), so expect to stand in the aisle or sit along the window sills. The bartenders are good at flagging you down when seats are available, though. No matter if I were standing or sitting, my glass was never empty. The complimentary popcorn was a bonus as well.My favorite cocktail of the evening was the Baby Got Back, which had a nice kick to it. The muddled jalapenos and blackberries really made this drink. It had just the right amount of sweetness with some added heat. Top the gin off with some Pimm's Liqueur and you got yourself one heck of a cocktail. So good! I also tried the Thoroughbred of Sin from their returning favorites list, which was also quite good with its pepper infused vodka and ginger beer. They have a seasonal cocktail list, so definitely check it out and grab something on there.We already ate dinner before we got there, but man I wish we didn't. Their sandwiches looked and smelled so good! The owner, Jeff, offered us a sample of his Nutella bread pudding we couldn't resist. Although its consistency reminded me more of a brownie than bread pudding,this dessert was amazing. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's served in a Dixie paper bowl. It's warm, gooey, and chocolaty. Topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips, o m g! Looks like it would be overly sweet, but it's not. This is a must when you come to Bar Liquorice.Definitely a neighborhood gem serving up great cocktails in a laid back environment."}, {"review_id": "_RXRv5IQdKM9s7-fLa3fIA", "user_id": "bcIydJBBfMPuErIZa_z-Hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "This place is awesome!!!

I haven't been since Shaun was behind the bar making amazing drinks and I wasn't sure if things would still be as good. The owner Jeff has definitely made sure they are! Tyler made great drinks and I highly recommend letting him just play around and make you his own creation. And Jeff is just such an awesome fun presence.

He is a performer, a personality and above all love!!!!The moment I met Jeff (Owner), on my birthday of all things, he stunned. His personality. His love for his customers. His appreciation for your business!!!!! And his hospitality.  HE IS EVERYTHING! The secret to the success of Liquorice! I can't forget that the bathroom was so clean I could've eaten from the sink if I was so inclined.

Tickled your tastebuds with all kinds of flavors. The bread was toasted perfectly. Would highly recommend. I also appreciated that the sandwich came with cooler ranch doritos. The five stars really goes to the owner though. A real down to earth guy, offering some of the best service I've ever experienced. Randomly throws you a candy bar as you're waiting for your food.

Decided I need to write this review because the service is exceptional. The bartender and another gentleman (owner maybe?) have made me feel extremely taken care of but not in an overwhelming \"leave me alone\" kind of way the way other places do. As soon as I sat down I was presented with delicious rosemary popcorn. I came two weeks ago and got a sandwich to go and when I came in today the bartender remembered me and what I ordered last time. Impressive. Just as I was about to finish my draft beer someone else set down a small cup of Nutella bread pudding topped with whipped cream in front of me. I'm just very impressed and feel very welcomed. And they're across the street from where I live!

Sweetest host who hugged each and every one of us when we left.
