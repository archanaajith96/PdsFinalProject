This is it!According to the reviews, this place is best known for its Bloody Mary's and mimosas, but I'm 5 months pregnant so I'll have to wait to review those. I ordered the Dig In breakfast plate, and it was amazing. The seasoning on the layer of breakfast potatoes was perfect. And the cronuts are dangerously good, I had to limit myself to one.Deanna was an amazing server, we sat at the bar. She never let my coffee get more than half empty, she made sure everything was to our liking. For a busy Saturday morning, she had plenty of people to keep an eye on but she never forgot about us. She went above and beyond.Everything was clean, I didn't see anything that stood out to be a health or safety hazard (I have some background in food service). And, they have a military discount. No doubt we'll be hitting this place every weekend, HIGHLY recommended."}, {"review_id": "Vx0n7wN0zQIz7NGSv58aoQ", "user_id": "s0Zv5uDVQA9Qtmfh99f9BA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I believe that the Egg Bistro may be the only worthwhile breakfast joint in the entire area. It is very convenient for us to get to, and though the parking seems limited we've never actually been unable to get a space. However, there's going to be at least a 30 minute wait on the weekends no matter what time you go (plan accordingly time-wise; I would suggest grabbing a coffee on the way to the Bistro to sip on while you wait). There were a few things that fell short for me. Up front, the biggest disappointment was the coffee. The regular coffee was nothing at all special. Somewhat-weak diner coffee at best, and we were told that this location isn't even capable of making espresso/any espresso based coffee beverages. I don't have to have coffee with my meal, and there are plenty of other things to drink, so it wasn't that bad. Unfortunately, the water does not taste good whatsoever either, very sharp and chemically. Definitely not filtered (or if it is, it could use more filtering). Upon looking at the drinks, we decided to try a $10 flight of mimosas. Without realizing that they are technically virgin, unless you specify otherwise. The flight requires you to specifically request alcohol be added, which we didn't realize immediately, and had to ask for some to add after. Their full mimosas seem to be made properly however. To that effect, they do have a fun and flavorful selection of \"brunch booze\" to enjoy while having breakfast or lunch, making it a great place for group outings. I hear the bloody Mary's are something of a specialty. It is a very clean, and efficient establishment, with prompt and attentive staff.   Now, on to the highly positive aspects; the food! I found a new favorite dish here. It is the phenomenal, spectacular, perfect, rave-worthy bacon wrapped asparagus... with the best hollandaise sauce I have ever had. It came out very hot, and fresh, buttery, crisp, with the right amount of char, flavorful thick bacon, creamy sauce, and was just generally delightful in every way. The best asparagus I have ever had, anywhere, and a very elegant side dish to say the least. I could eat the bacon wrapped asparagus every single day. Aside from that, the omelets are not skimpy at all, but rather huge, fluffy, well-stuffed, and flavorful. They have a wonderful selection of fillings that you can choose for yourself, if you desire. What I really love about this menu is how easy it is to order exactly what you want, how you want it. Fruits, veggies, tomatoes, endless types of meat, etc. All easy to access and combine. Such great variety. The tomato, though it is charged somewhat expensively, as a side item, was actually ripe, delicious, and came in a decent sized serving (rather than the one or two meager slices, as most places tend to do, if they offer tomato anywhere on their menu at all). It was highly refreshing. The sheer option of meats, as well as a la carte options was fantastic. I had the peppered bacon--and I have to say, it may be my new favorite breakfast food. I've never had bacon this good at a restaurant before. It's just thick enough, yet lean enough, to hit that glorious place between crunchy and chewy, with incredible smokey-sweet-savory flavor. The perfect 'umami' breakfast accompaniment. Next time, I will absolutely be exploring the eggs benedict options, as they all sound unique, flavorful, and highly enticing. We may even try it for dinner on a night where that is an option. The menu is a lovely size with so many options to fit plenty of different appetites/dietary needs."}, {"review_id": "sKlv8ZMpH8eQVitpUGHXRQ", "user_id": "YW10n4RqTv1Cpx3g0F6K6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Upon arrival the parking lot was full and parking limited. To our surprise all the car seemed to be at The Egg Bistro!!! We waited for about 20 minuets for seating in the small but not cramped restaurant. The seats were 4 to a table allowing them to serve larger parties. They also offered bar seating. I enjoyed seeing the hustle and bustle of the servers, bus boys, and wait staff. A sense of urgency increases my anticipation, most busy places have very good food and The Egg Bistro did not disappoint! The restaurant and surrounding areas were well kept and clean. When we entered we were greeted quickly in an upbeat and cheerful tone! And again when our table was ready! Every table was full and as I observed others enjoying their delicious looking food! The amazingly fun and cheerful Regina was our waitress. Regina's service was in point! She is very knowledgeable and clearly a people person. I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast with hash browns corned beef and egg. The french toast was like a Cinnabon with syrup!! Fantastic corned beef hash and the egg was scrambled perfectly! I drank a Tough Mary and it was delicious as well. My husband and best friend both ordered the Meat Lovers Omelet will her husband ordered Steak and eggs. They both raved about how much meat was in their omelets. Overall this place is GREAT topped with EXCELLENCE."}, {"review_id": "mrB3ue19AbepIvDiYF_RKg", "user_id": "_KaWXWIFuucvaxhzRNuymQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I come here mostly for breakfast now.

I'm Not really a fan of poached egg but I would definitely come back here. I enjoyed everything on my plate except for the poached egg but Thats just me .

More texture, and enjoyable to eat than the small grind stuff most people use.I had the country eggs benedict, with hash browns. The asparagus was al dente, not soggy. The bacon bitswere just enough to bring a good taste, without overpowering everything else, as bacon tends to do. The hash browns were well cooked and crispy.

I also like how you are able to order the French Toast ala carte. Also, how awesome are their cubed hash browns?!?! It was like having French fries for breakfast (and I loved it). Of course, I ordered a mimosa flight bc those are 10/10 as always but the flavors I recommend would include the peach pear, mango, PINEAPPLE, & forbidden fruit. (mostly pineapple though.)

My family and I decided to dine here on a Saturday morning. We didn't realize how popular this place is. We had a party of 3 and we had to wait about 45 minutes. The wait wasn't bad because they have a waiting area inside and a few seats outside. When we were seated the server was very enthusiastic. She also helped us select the best breakfast items on the menu. I had buttermilk pancakes, eggs, and bacon. The pancakes were extremely fluffy. But my favorite was the bacon because they weren't thin crappy bacon, it was thick and delicious. Even though the restaurant was packed, our food came out within 20 minutes of us sitting down. They also have a great staff. My daughter spilled water all over table and floor and the server immediately came over to wipe it up. She was extremely helpful and nice.

I have been coming to this location for a few years now because there is literally no breakfast place, in my opinion, that can beat this one! I have gotten a few things on their menu, and everything has been delicious every.single.time ! I honestly have not tasted anything bad here. I love that the kitchen is open to the bar area because the fresh smell of bacon and sausage gravy radiating through the air is enough to get you drooling! I usually like to order something from their \"Belly Belly Good\" portion of the menu which consists of hardy food like corned beef hash and chicken fried steak (which are both delightful, btw). Other menu options I can recommend are the Dig In, sausage gravy and biscuits, carnitas breakfast burrito, and for lunch, the So Right sandwich! Everything is literally mouth-watering. They have a multitude of omelets for any taste you're craving, and they are MASSIVE! Trust me, you will be taking leftovers home. After coming off night shift with my nurse coworker, we head straight to this spot and order a delicious flight of mimosas (only $10 for 4!) and some yummy breakfast. My faaaaavorite mimosa is the orchard; it tastes like apple juice with a surprising bubbly (and adult) finish! Service here is outstanding every time, and everyone always has a smile on their face! The one thing that anyone might have to say about this place is that on weekends there is usually a wait to be seated. But honestly, the establishment has so much seating that it takes about 30 minutes to get through a long wait line of about 15 people! plus if you're feeling like you don't wanna wait inside, the speaker is connected to the outside so you won't miss your spot when it opens up! there is also a cute consignment store and olive oil store next door that you can poke around in while waiting.
