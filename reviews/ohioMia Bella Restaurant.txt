Our \"lets eat someplace in Little Italy\" turn into us going to Mia Bella based on its great reviews. Parking in Little Italy sucks, but they do have valet. I would definitely suggest making a reservation. We made one for our larger group and were seated right away and the restaurant was about half full at 630 on a weekday. By 7 it was totally full. Good service (they even fill your water glass as you're about to take a sip). Our waitress was knowledgeable about the daily specials and convinced us on the special appetizer and wine. The food did take probably a little over 30min to come out, but it was piping hot and delicious! I got the cheese tortellini. I added sausage, but that was totally not necessary since it already came with porchetta (poor ordering on my part). Portion sizes are large enough to have some leftovers, but I definitely could have eaten it all. Overall, I would definitely come back for my pasta fix. But maybe for lunch next time because dinner got a little pricy."}, {"review_id": "QnZ7CCK9z0GkAop0fY17bA", "user_id": "qIygsTNe3Dbds0YWMMhE_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "From the service to the food, MBR has it all. We went here for my birthday meal prior to catching the orchestra at severance hall and it did not disappoint. Located at the corner of Mayfield and Murray hill, the second we walked in we were greeted by the host and sat at our seats. I highly recommend a reservation.The seating is cozy but not crowded. I didn't feel cramped for space like many restaurants in little Italy. The wine list has great choices and our waiter gave us a great bottle of silver oak. It was national pizza day so we went with a pepperoni pizza that is enough to be an appetizer for two or a meal for one.For main courses, we went with the award winning spicy tortellini and the pasta Verde. They lived up to the reviews. I loved the tortellini and added some red pepper flakes for even more kick. My wife loves the pasta Verde which was a delicious pestso pasta with veggies. Solid portions and plenty of sauce for bread dipping.  Out the door with a 20%+ tip for less than 100$. Walked down to severance hall in less than 20 mins. The only down side is parking, which is the obstacle for any restaurant near university circle/little Italy. You can circle for off street parking, but we just paid up for a lot closer to euclid avenue which came to 15$ for 5 or 6 hours."}, {"review_id": "qrMMHjG6augzL6fHh-Ie9g", "user_id": "g4ptSwb0C1b7PYDo8lHDpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Great restaurant in Little Italy.

We also both ordered the Lobster Ravioli, which was also amazing. I got a Mia Bella salad which was okay, but nothing special. I also got the Great Gatsby drink which was also just okay, but the crab appetizer and the lobster ravioli alone make this a 5 Star.

It was snowing so the jury was out about getting back into the car to go out. A friend recommended Little Italy and turns out it's only a mile and a half away from my hotel!The first restaurant to pop up was MIA Bella so I made my way.  It was meant to be because I found street parking directly in front of this brick lined street and restaurant. (Valet station in front of restaurant different times of the week.) as I parked I heard music being played from the ?? Restaurant? It was snowy so I didn't identify where it was coming from.  Magical! It was a snowy Monday so it wasn't busy (yet) and I snagged a seat at the bar. The friendly bartender was on it with a glass of Tempranillo and water- some bread to munch on with herb butter while I made an important dining decision.  Turns out it was hard to decide which pasta to eat - but with his recommendation I went for the Spicy cheese tortellini with prosciutto, peas, and tomatoes.  It was perfect! Not too spicy, full of flavor- rich!   Turns out I should have brought more of an appetite and couldn't finish it (nice portion).  Sadly I had to take some cannoli home (how tragic)! It was fine to go (the cannoli) and a great blend of crisp shell and luscious filling.  As you can tell- I hated it (NOT)!

I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant, the decor was absolutely beautiful, food was delicious, drinks were great and the waiter was excellent! This was the first restaurant I had ever been to in Cleveland, it's a spot in little Italy and it's so cute! We got a cozy table right beside the window, and it was just us. The whole night we could see outside and look through the window to the pretty street outside, it was super romantic. I highly recommend this spot to couples for Valentine's day or even a first date!This is was hands down the best Italian food (pasta) I've ever had! I cannot rave about it enough. We had complimentary bread and butter, Cesar salad as a starter and for dinner - we ordered the veggie penne with grilled chicken and the pasta with homemade marinara sauce and grilled chicken. Seriously, best pasta and sauces I've ever had! I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone who is a pasta and Italian food lover like me! The drinks weren't on the menu, they were specials cocktails that were equally delicious, and they have an extensive wine collection too. I cannot wait to go back and try everything else on the menu!! Keep up the good work guys, see you soon. :)"}, {"review_id": "6NWH1ZhnhrLsDJjpxNP4Dw", "user_id": "CEtdmaMlzLevoJG4Aet6VA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I still really love this place. What I love mostly is the consistency! My boyfriend and I went in yesterday with a reservation and were seating around 20 minutes after our reservation. We got seated by the door with lots of foot traffic which isn't fun when it's cold out. The food: My boyfriend got the tortellini with sausage as he always gets and it's just as delicious, creamy, and flavorful as the first time! I got the Albanian salad and special salmon & risotto dish. The salad was delicious, awesome fresh flavors. The salmon was cooked perfectly but the risotto and the mango relish and the sauce around the dish were all sweet. There were also whole large veggies such as whole carrots and large asparagus. There was a lot going on in the dish and I would say it could've been better if there were less ingredients.

It reminded me so much of the countless pistachio gelato I had when I traveled abroad in Italy. I would say Mia Bella's gelato is pretty authentic!
