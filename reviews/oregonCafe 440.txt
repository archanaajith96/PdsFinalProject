Like a couple dozens of the other reviews here, I noticed their service seems to be very hit or miss. I had the blackened ahi tuna sandwich with the wasabi aioli on the side. It might actually be the best ahi sandwich I've ever had. The mango salsa on top added a hint of acidity and sweetness that paired so well with the spices of the tuna. The tuna itself was also seared perfectly. I mixed the aioli with some ketchup for my fries  The fries are some of best I've ever had too. One ding tho! the ciabatta bread wasn't really the greatest vessel for the tuna. The bottom half was so ridiculously soggy. I liked it but some ppl may find that off putting! My friend had the pulled pork mac and cheese. A good option when you can't decide between the pulled pork sandwich or the mac and cheese. It's a huge portion. She loved it but only finished half.We also had the jalapeño artichoke dip with homemade tortilla chips (happy hour price was $6; happy hour is everyday 3-6pm). Pretty good. The jalapeño was pretty subtle so don't expect too much heat!"}, {"review_id": "LMoPTWm3e9Y90FquA771qA", "user_id": "TXOXG57VP47VMVZDSeyEjQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Nope. Not any more. I was a fan for a few years, returning a few times a year since it's opened. It has slid further and further downhill and I'm not willing to do it anymore. There is no concept here and are now much better choices I guess. At first, I accepted zero atmosphere, strip mall, too cold HVAC, and higher than average prices because I thought the food was worth it. Service is also amateur and crappy here even by Eugene standards, last few times I've been. I don't need to go into the minute details, but I'm not really a very demanding customer really. I used to love their mac n cheese -- but sorry, this time it had zero salt/seasoning at all for $14.00. Dinner entrees are in the $20-26 range, and for Eugene, that needs to be a top of the line dinner plate with accompanying service and a little bit of atmosphere. Dinner a a drink for two plus an app and a tip (for what?) can easily reach the $80.00 mark here. Kitchy ad-hoc decorations (fake flowers, framed newspaper articles, cheesy figurines) clashing with some modern decor, high and ugly ceiling, no table lighting/candles. Just not worth it."}, {"review_id": "eIa79iYCmGYbjg2YWgtvIg", "user_id": "68L3xaBUvw_AW644F6okWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "This is a cute little place. It is very unassuming since it is kind of in a strip mall.I love grilled cheese and this place did not leave me disappointed. POoey gooey cheesey with tomatoes on a wonderfully crusted bread. They used three different cheeses including tillamook white cheddar.I also had sweet potato fries with horseradish ketchup.They also offer housemade desserts. They offered cinnamon roll bread pudding with maple glaze, vanilla bean cheesecake with strawberry couli, and flourless chocolate torte. I was too full to have any but it sounded great!"}, {"review_id": "tLyiV4KKT6yuWIju0A3zRA", "user_id": "tAdMuTtpO4l6kLekwjehYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Holy cow. I can't believe it took me this long to try this place. Café 440 is located in a small plaza near Oakway Mall. This place is known for brunch and tasty Mac n cheese, so I decided to give them a try!I went in on a Monday and the place was packed. The wait was about 20 minutes. When we got seated, the server kindly asked us if we wanted the blind down because the sun was shining. I thought it was very kind of them  We ended up getting chicken enchiladas and BBQ Pulled pork Mac n cheese. Chicken enchiladas were okay, it definitely wasn't worth $16 for my personal experience. BUT their pork Mac n cheese totally made up for it. Holy smokes. I've never had Mac n cheese like this. So tasty and I would go back just for that dish. 10 out of 10. Long story short, everyone in Eugene should give this place a try because it is AMAZING and local! Yay!"}, {"review_id": "RsJjYpEfJqK2DwaXTqcYHw", "user_id": "7wiUO0o3dgXYPBmpYim10g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Could not believe the service provided her. My boyfriend and I came for a nice anniversary dinner, took us 30 mins to get seated, so we already knew what we wanted when we were finally approached by our rude waitress. She took our order, another 30 mins went by, she came by to say that the \"kitchen was slow and she was sorry\"... still had yet to receive our iced teas. When our appetizers finally arrived, we were overwhelmed when our entree came less than 3 mins later. I asked the waitress why this had happened and she yanked the entree out of my hands and rolled her eyes. I approached the manager, who was extremely understanding and had our entrees remade at a later time. Our waitress was no longer allowed at our table per the manager, but constantly made rude looks over. Overall, for semi pricey food, the service is not there. Would not return. There are much better places to eat on coburg than this!!! Listen to the other reviews about poor service! I tried to ignore them but was let down."}, {"review_id": "hxKXxc81Tv2Mtiz7nqc-Ww", "user_id": "53CJR5RAj3OZ_4vVCnSaCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Food is Amazing everytime we go there.

My favorite! The sandwich is filled with all different sorts of cheeses and some tomato slices. I always ask to substitute the regular fries for sweet potato, and boom you have it! A perfect meal. Don't forget to ask for the soup of the day. I've had their Thai curry soup which was amazing. Only downside to the restaurant is the wait time. Food takes a little bit longer to come out, but if you're okay with that, get ready for some amazing food!"}, {"review_id": "qfFrkzJXwapnQUwBU_G4Jg", "user_id": "rx9zFJdZHJszMIv8g0yTxw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Came here on a Sunday at around 5 pm for dinner. (Yeah I'm getting old) and were sat right away. my wife got the burger which she enjoyed. The bun was soft, meat was flavorful. She normally does not like her burger with pink but she liked this one. I got the spare rib with mash potatoes and veggies. The veggies were soggy, I think that was on purpose. I like my veggies crisp. But the spare rib was tender. The roasted red pepper soup was delish. The kids portions are enough for an adult. Service was friendly and the place was clean.

Yukon potatoes done perfectly and grilled asparagus.. outstanding..I order the Opah since we've eaten it often in Maui.. it just requires olive oil , salt and pepper and grilled hot for 1-1/2-2 minutes per side to be moist and tender. This blackened Opah was so overdone it wasn't possible to consume and the very cheesy grits were no help.. I was credited $5 for my drink but this was so disappointing for a restaurant we always have enjoyed.. I wouldn't recommend to anyone unless the chef changes his idea of how this great fish should be prepared. Our serverwas not to blame for my ordering error but my gin and tonic tall came in about 15 minutes and \"short\" as it must have been \"slow\"gin.. not their best effort."}, {"review_id": "s-1BAJUiaUHA_TFdymKh-w", "user_id": "z2rmVcV11NLWh4ohwgjxlw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Went to this location for a business lunch. Had drinks and appetizers while discussing development plans. I enjoyed the fried oysters and ahi poke salad. Fried Oysters are always hard to get right because they are delicate and require keen attention to detail. My feeling is that the kitchen over cooked the oysters. I've not returned for a second lunch round, but if I do, I'll try the oysters again for a second experience. Regarding the Poke, it was well prepared and yummy. I'd recommend Cafe 440 to friends and family."}, {"review_id": "8jUupVlFuUvmSEtB5wCy5g", "user_id": "wwlvV5i5OCriJoONDpTFfw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "1 star for their fabulous chicken pesto sandwich 1 star for the best nachos in town0 stars for LITERALLY the worst service in town!!! 0 stars for not accepting american express0 stars for not having juice options on their menu The service is so bad.

Yelp to the rescue, again! We were looking for a quick bite and this was one of the first locations to pop up, that was not closed yet, food looked good, and it had great reviews. Well, it definitely did not disappoint. We were greeted almost immediately by the friendly staff. Our server, Sarah, was the sweetest! She gave us great recos! The poutine and pork nachos were really good! My fave was the buttermilk chive dressing that came with the house salad. Cafe 440 should bottle up this stuff, it's SO good!!! The music was awesome; it was all 80s, my fave! Definitely a great stop for us because we needed a good stretch from our looooong ride back to Cali.

The burger is the best in town, this is my boyfriend's burger place, he never orders anything else and says it's the best every time we eat here.I've had most of the menu items and order many of them over and over. Favorites: Cobb salad, salmon cakes, pork sliders, nachos, chicken peanut bowl, fries. The flavor combinations are spot on here, sauces are really thoughtful and most of it is house made from scratch -- that's hard to beat. These people know good food. My only criticism is the desserts. We're told they're made fresh daily. So far they've been just ordinary, nothing to rave about."}, {"review_id": "9L6GpPzUHbkC-WrXxAWZkQ", "user_id": "ekZVRa5j5Hl6GaiuSKfOKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/9/2016", "text": "We were traveling with our dog and arrived in the afternoon for lunch.

Sure enough, she arrived  with menus as well as clean bowl and water for our dog. So kind.Lunch was amazing. I ordered a blackened fish sandwich which was so flavorful.  My hubby ordered a Greek salad made with spinach rather than iceberg lettuce, a nice twist and also delicious. We shared an ahi poke which was so good as well as well as a bowl of tomato basil soup.  In addition to flavor, the presentations of all the dishes was quite creative.Wish this place was closer to home.
