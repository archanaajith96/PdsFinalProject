They had radio station I-95.1 live broadcasting there during my visit. Ordered a few things on a whim with not high expectations. (Especially after my experience at Iggys.)Happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. - The White clam chowder was easily in the top ten in terms of taste!- Clam Cakes, just as I remember them from when the amusement park was open. Could use a bit more clams, but still better than most places around. They don't sell them by the half, or dozen but by the container size. This is great rather than per item.. Better batter than most as well. - Cod fish cakes.. I haven't had them in years, and I can tell you that they are some of the best I've ever had! - Doughboys... While not a huge db fan, they were light, and not full of grease like other places. Very enjoyable to say the least!"}, {"review_id": "Ura3YgcbtkusrtvRuvgkUg", "user_id": "EEnWl-gRn0dEkeIbX2bF6Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Probably good to verify that they are open before you go so you don't waste your time.

Clam cakes, chowdah and my daughter had a chicken fingers kids meal.  Clam cakes are small so really contemplate eating more than you expect!  The chowder was not the best but not the worst. It was chock full of stuff but lacked liquid.  My daughters meal was $7 (without a drink) and there was not a lot of chicken!  Mostly fries.  Super cute idea... I would just like to see more rocky Point here like facts, more pictures and any actual pieces from the park?The girl at the window- I think she hates her life or hates her job!  Needs to be happier and friendly!On a a high note- they gave my Dad a nice free Father's day t-shirt!  It was actually really cute!  Nice touch!Also, the gentleman cleaning up the grounds was super friendly and nice!"}, {"review_id": "dcV1GPPdiRv3YOMUmrscSw", "user_id": "x8KO1C8ckad2AYCsVaDtPw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "Summer is here and I am always up for trying new place for my favorite New England staple- clam strips. This past Sunday evening, local favorite, Tommy's was closing so a group of us decided to try Rocky Point Clam Shack. This was a first time for all five of us. Most seafood on the menu is at market price. I found this strange that even a side order of clam strips was labeled this way. For a small take out container of strips, the price on Sunday was $11.99. Insanely overpriced for what you received. Aunt Carries clams and frie dinner is 4 times the size for only a few dollars more. The rest of the group got fried shrimp, clam strip dinner, fish sandwich, chicken tenders, nachos and also fried pickles to share. Let me start off with the service. Both girls at the counter were less than thrilled to be there. Both gave snippy attitudes when asked questions and really made us all feel like we were an inconvenience. The guy that was packaging the food however was very friendly. He pointed out all the condiments and made sure there was nothing else any of us needed. Now on to the grand reveal- the food. Can I give everyone a recommendation? Go anywhere else. No...really, it was absolutely horrible. The only thing that was actually very delicious were the seasoned fries. If I was having a craving and there was no one in line, I would stop for a side of fries. Oh, and maybe a soda. The clam strips were so chewy, absolutely no flavor and whatever grease they fried them in gave it this terribly heavy feel when you digested them. I did not try the shrimp, but apparently it was primarily batter with extremely small shrimp somewhere in the middle. The fish sandwich and chicken tenders were sub par from my friends looks after finishing them. The fried pickles were sliced very thick, so they could not absorb any flavor from the batter. The nachos were soggy.I will say, I have always loved the nostalgia surrounding Rocky Point Park. I was never able to visit there, but it is so great to see all the smiles that it had brought to people, especially native Rhode Islanders. I loved seeing all the artifacts from the demolished park and that they set them up around the 'shack.' If Rocky Point was as great as people have told me, this place is far from a five star representation."}, {"review_id": "vja-Sw0AdQmVVxTt9hp1ug", "user_id": "SKFl7Xcqljldn0F9RIWA-w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/29/2017", "text": "This place was probably the worst clam chowder and lobster rolls I have ever had... I could get way better chowder and lobster rolls in New Jersey!I was looking forward to my family's annual trip to Rhode Island for fresh, delicious clam chowder and lobster rolls but now wish I had gone somewhere else in the state to eat. We decided to order take out because we are traveling with our dog. We waited for at least half an hour for our food to be ready but we ordered a large amount so I can understand. Once we got our food, we drove back to the hotel to eat only to realize they forgot to give us 2 lobster rolls we had ordered. I should have been more careful and checked all the boxes but with the amount of food we had ordered, there were already so many boxes I had to carry I must have forgotten to check for the lobster rolls. I called them to let them know I had not gotten my rolls and when they checked the kitchen, I was told they had forgotten to give them to me. Stuff like this happens and I understand.  I was slightly annoyed to begin with but what annoyed me even more was even though I ordered two mayo lobster rolls as it clearly states on my receipt posted, they gave me one mayo and one butter. I didn't realize until I got to the hotel again.... CHECK ALL YOUR FOOD WHEN YOU PICK UP!!! I tried to keep an open mind and enjoy the experience but I was so disappointed when I tried both of the lobster rolls. The lobster to mayo ratio was so off and I felt like I was eating a mayo and celery roll with a few bites of actual lobster.  The buttered lobster roll tasted like grease..... my dads fried oyster roll too was GREASE!!!  The clam chowder was so watery I totally agree with the previous review that I can get way better canned clam chowder from a grocery store. I was expecting at least the food to be good considering how popular this place seems on yelp... they were kind enough to toss in fried Oreos for free when I went to pick up the lobster rolls and I have to say they were the only thing I liked from everything I ordered. Hopefully my family and I can find a better place to get our clam chowder and lobster roll fix tomorrow before we head home."}, {"review_id": "-_T1-oJIIdzpkp3KN8juyw", "user_id": "Q0RRMjeHEGndEQrpcvOOiQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/21/2016", "text": "Came here while getting my tires changed and was thoroughly unimpressed.If you run a clam shack, I'm sure some would say that your clam cakes had better be on point. This is true, but in my opinion, your chowder (whether Rhode Island, New England, or Manhattan) had better be even better. This place's white clam chowder is some of the lowest quality I've had since I've gotten here. First off, for $4.25 an eight-ounce bowl, I was expecting clams and potatoes for days. Not so. Most of the soup was broth with a few potatoes here and there and a couple clam remnants. What clams there were seemed to have been boiled down until they lost all tenderness and flavor. In addition, while some of the black flecks in the soup were pepper, the grittiness against my teeth while eating sent a giant red flag signaling something else: sand. On a hot day, if you're looking for a cool place to sit in the shade and relax, keep driving. Rocky Point is basically a couple of trailers (one to pay, one to pick up) on a giant black top parking lot with picnic tables, meaning that during the season you actually want to go, you're going to get scorched. The umbrellas might save you a sunburn but you're definitely going to sweat it out and toast your buns on a picnic bench. If you're  going to eat here, take it to go- at least then you can park nearby, crank the AC in your car, and beat the heat. Yes, it's near the airport. Yes, it's convenient. Yes, the staff are friendly. But if you're coming to Rhode Island for the first time, don't let these guys take your chowder and clam cakes cherry. Save that flower, tourists. Keep looking."}, {"review_id": "qvO5vioqDaHFXOY-kbyysw", "user_id": "sfel3yPwPqMMEZ2E9-EApA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/26/2016", "text": "Took my little fam here for something different other than a nice sit-in place with shiny forks/utensils.

I ordered the lobster roll, kiddies fish N chips, shrimp cocktail, and fried pickles. Also ordered three bottled drinks and the total wasn't too bad -- $43 give or take. To Me?...I think the food tastes better than Iggy's. We went around 5pm and there weren't any lines. However, they got busy shortly after we got our food...so we beat the rush. I'd like to go back and try their chowdah. Didn't order any bc it was 90 degrees out but they have plenty of shade with umbrellas on every bench table.

I do know that it is a local favorite, and most 30+ have some fond memory of the taste and experience. My friends I think you memory has forsaken you.There were so many downers. I envisioned a shack by the sea, with the Salty breeze blowing my hair - What I got was the down channel of the airport and huge bill. My first fear was that my daughter was too close to fast moving traffic. Some can say that there is little concern because it is fenced in, but the truth is that, it's not fenced well, and it is an operating parking lot for the business situated there. I ordered the fish and chips and I have to say it did taste fishy. HUM your thinking \"Shouldn't fish taste fishy?\" I was always taught no. If it does taste too fishy it may be bad. I assure you that it was NOT bad but just stronger than I like. The clam cakes were really good. I love that they are bite sized. I do not typically buy clam cakes by the dozen because they are so HUGE at other places, so this was a nice change.  The red chowder that my husband had was definitely better than the white. It had great flavor and just enough of everything. The white was hardy too but I found it to be a little runny. I like my chowda' thick. Lastly the bill came to 60 dollars. I thought that this was outrageous for side of the road take out. The final order was as follows:1 dozen clam-cakes1/2 dozen dough boysFish & Chips dinner w/ a cup of white chowderA pint of red chowderA child's hot dog meal2 drinksI could have gotten all this at Greggs for half the price, better chowder, table service, pickles and rolls. ...ehh I've had better."}, {"review_id": "0mal9PXZ24fU3syTfYB6CQ", "user_id": "zUKeZNu4tCG56xjwWH54Vw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/2/2016", "text": "When I saw the sign for \"Rocky Point Clam Shack\" it reminded me of good, simple food that I had as a kid at the beach.

I do wish they would switch to cardboard/paper.There are two shacks: one on be right to order and one in the left to pick up. Cash and card both accepted. The (ample) seating is entirely outdoors and is wheelchair accessible. Each picnic table has an umbrella. There were artifacts and signage from the old Rocky Point Amusement Park, closed in 1996. I have a feeling that this is a favorite spot for nostalgic native Rhode Islanders and former amusement park goers.

Seriously. Never eat anything again. The clam cakes are very good with big chunks of clam in them. Seasoned well, salty, and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside without being heavy. The red chowder was decent, but I won't get it again. The lobster roll in butter, however, I could eat everyday. For breakfast, lunch and dinner. UPDATEI got the whole belly clams (8oz side for $14) and the lobster roll with mayo today. Clams were superb. Clean, well seasoned, crispy and yet creamy, with a sweetness at the end. Fantastic. The traditional mayo lobster roll was excellent. The roll was toasted and the mayo filling was on top of a leaf of romaine. This kept the roll from getting soggy and added a fresh crunch to the lobster salad. I can't decide which I like better, mayo or butter!

You go wrong when you dont consistently change your grease and the food tastes of dirty grease. On top of that the food wasnt very ell drained so some items were greasy.  I tried to call them but they didnt answer, One thing that was an absolute plus was the freshness of the shrimp. the freshness came through the nasty grease flavor but that was just about it.
