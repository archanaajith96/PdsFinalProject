On the morning I left the Country Club Plaza area for the airport, I searched for coffeeshops between there and the airport. I stumbled upon Quay Coffee, which was an excellent choice. The biggest downside was the fact that it was a Monday, and there seemed to be a 2-hour parking limit on the streets. Maybe there was a better place, but probably helped me work faster and more efficiently. The barista was sweet, as she stared at my indecision about which coffee and pastry to get. So many tasty-sounding options! I ended up getting a latte with spiced brown sugar, as well as a rosemary and walnut scone. Both excellent and would recommend.Plenty of seating. I sat by the window where there were electrical outlets and plenty of sunlight. Wifi was strong. Really, the whole experience was perfect. I headed to the airport after while thinking about how much I love Kansas City."}, {"review_id": "0L2OtSeEbb203tUHHHwGVA", "user_id": "qCu_bt6LmIUex2YnjPgTvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "This has become one of my favorite coffee shops in Kansas City!!!

The river market location is easy to find and has lights in the windows. We walk to Quay but I'm sure parking wouldn't be a problem, although on weekends you now have to pay for parking. I usually get a vanilla latte and my fiancé get a brown sugar latte. They are very consistent. I think they taste better when we stay and drink them at Quay....The burritos are also TO DIE FOR. It would be even better with some hot sauce and sour cream on the side. The people working here rock, don't look much farther for a quality latte. My mom also tried their chai tea and said it was the best tea she has ever had."}, {"review_id": "SNhrsn1kCeeuv5gV17v2Lw", "user_id": "opdbggrufvUGH8gP9wHL8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "A good, no-nonsense, third wave coffee shop in the heart of the river market district of Kansas City. I came here twice and mostly liked my experience. Here's the scoop:The coffee: I give the actual coffee a 7/10: They do not roast their own beans, but use local-ish roasters instead. I say \"ish\" because there were no roasters from the KC area represented here, but all their beans came from either Missouri or Oklahoma. My almond milk latte was just so/so: the almond milk they use does not steam very well, so it tasted a little burnt and harsh. My pour-over was a lot better; it was well made and consistent with the advertised flavor profile. The shop itself: 9/10: Lots of space and seating options, including a lot of space for working. Plugs are available at almost all the seating that's near a wall. Some more comfy options as well. Cool lighting and love the big windows in the front. Wifi is fast and free. They open earlier and stay open later than many other coffee places in the area. The location: 9/10: Very convenient location the heart of the river market area and right off the street car (which is free!). You can be here from as far away as Union Station in 15 minutes. Parking seems pretty ample.In all, this is a good choice for coffee in downtown KC, particularly if you need to get some work done, although they do not roast their own beans."}, {"review_id": "BwcJGgD0lFY5FzYWKidYaA", "user_id": "KwvRe-PiRGqVRAoF8bodbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "Great space to get work done! Pretty open with good seating. Plenty of options of solo seating or group seating. Has a big window that makes for some good \"get (insert whatever you're working on) done\". Employees were friendly. Vanilla Latte was decent.The menu seemed smaller, but I didn't look at it too much. MUSIC CHOICE was on point, a little Simple Plan vibe happening. Very good for my inner teenage angsty self. It's in a cool location, I just live further away from the River Market area so probably won't be my go to coffee shop, but every once in a while I will trek that way!!"}, {"review_id": "qKMLbg_ujLgl0oLd4pFtpw", "user_id": "hnLAIE_csZ4q5P8srx6-eg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "One of the most classic coffee shops in KC. The unique theme of Quay coffee is embedded in their name, their drink options, and their decorations scattered throughout the shop, and I love it! Located on the streets near river market, it is a common site for many locals but also welcomes new coffee shop-goers. The baristas are extremely friendly, and the man who was helping my mom and I offered us samples of their syrup and discussed the sources of their coffee. I found it to be very interesting that their espresso is ground by a coffee shop in St. Louis called Blueprint coffee that I had visited this summer. My mom and I both opted for the lemon lavender honey latte with almond milk because the taste was light and refreshing in comparison to the askinosie dark milk chocolate syrup that was much richer. The latte was delicious and certainly hit the spot for a cool beverage on a warm day. There is plenty of seating options in this coffee shop for those who are studying and even for larger groups of people. I can certainly understand why people would enjoy studying in this ambience, and I certainly hope to return in the future!"}, {"review_id": "YYVVU0-GONlszhtJMnhM6A", "user_id": "wY_bNNfoex94midFkB07kA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "Cool coffee shop in a hip urban neighborhood with a street car and bike sharing.  Plenty of street parking.They have a house-made caramel that's delicious.  It's called Old Overholt Caramel.It's a really nice space with a bank vault with table and chairs you can sit in.  Good indie music, nice latte art, decent offering of pastry including huge pop tarts... with sprinkles!!

However, Quay seems to fit me perfectly.Food/Drink: As mentioned, I don't drink coffee. However, the breakfast burrito and rooibos tea I had were both delicious. I do wish the shop had a little bigger food menu (it consists of just breakfast burritos and cookies), but what I did get tasted great and was very affordable.Atmosphere/Music: During the four hours I was here, the noise level varied a lot. There were a few periods where the shop was pretty loud, but during the quiet stretches, the atmosphere was very pleasant. I really liked the music selection, and it was the right volume to set a good background tone without interfering with conversations or concentration.\"Studiability\": This might not apply to most people, but it's pretty big for me. There are two rather large tables in the back with plenty of room to spread out my laptop, books, notebooks, etc., and the shop was never so crowded that I felt like I was getting in the way of others at the table. There are plenty of outlets (with USB ports too!), the shop has free wifi... All in all, it's everything I could want in a study space.Overall, I like Quay a lot--it's certainly one of my new favorite coffee shops in KC."}, {"review_id": "_BVDjGI-0kIosscqzQY7Wg", "user_id": "AsUh-UQlJbZGInsV01CflA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "I absolutely fell in love with this place and wish I didn't live 25 minutes away.  This place nailed it in all aspects.  I am a huge coffee shop snob.  I am very particular, coffee has to be amazing, staff has to be welcoming and the ambiance has to be warm and comfy.  Quay did it all.  We came on a Friday morning around 8:30 and found there to be plenty of seating.  There are tables inside, a bar along the window with stools and a large table in the back along with smaller tables for a quieter atmosphere although the place was quiet everywhere.  Everyone is just so laid back.  There are also four or five tables outside so you can people watch.  The baristas are so kind and patient.  I always have a thousand questions about my coffee and food origins.  They answered everything with a smile.  I had the drip coffee from a St Louis roaster, it was probably the smoothest coffee I have had.  It had a nice chocolate note to it as well.  Husband had the iced Americano and got seconds so there you go.  I watched them as we waited for our drinks and they are so skilled.  They take time with every drink they make to be sure you get the best.  They offer five or six house made syrups like lemon lavender honey and they have soy and almond milk for only .45 cents extra.Their food is from Scratch Bakery.  They have sausage, chorizo and veggie burritos then a small selection of croissants, muffins and scones.  I had the rosemary walnut scone.  It was like a fluffy biscuit, so savory and delicious.  It had some icing drizzled on it, totally didn't need it but didn't negatively effect it either.  Husband had the sausage burrito.  WOW! Best breakfast burrito.  They heat it up perfectly on the panini press.  It is full of eggs, sausage and potatoes with just the right amount of cheese.  Not overkill so it still feels healthy.  The tortilla is almost buttery, so fresh.  And like the Americano, he ordered one for the road.  He is not a breakfast eater so that says something.  There is plenty of parking right in front of the building or a nearby lot.Love Quay!"}, {"review_id": "IjNRQm-cFgtKC-1sqWsiCA", "user_id": "84fJiqGWmwZFWA9CsJSP0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "Cute local coffee shop that offers just about what ever caffeinated drink you'll need to keep you alert.

So here's a quick breakdown.Location: It does not get any better than this. I have yet to struggle to find a parking spot either along Delaware St (2 hr limit I believe) or in the surface lot (4th St). I can make a day out of being in this area by visiting River Market, maybe do some grocery shopping; and there's the amazing pizza place (Il Lazzarone) next door ideal for lunch or dinner. With the KC streetcar coming through their street, it is definitely worth a visit.Product: Quay uses direct-trade Oddly Correct Roasters (mental note: visit Oddly Correct). I wish I could break free of the latte grip, but alas the grip is too strong my friends. I want to try every flavor here! They have 5 or 6 house-made flavors to choose from; recently, I tried the peppermint which was too subtle to detect but still delicious nonetheless. For the dangerous sort, definitely go for the spiced brown sugar latte. Sorry not sorry!Service: The baristas here are so great at what they do. You can't fake passion, and they've got loads of it! I am more than happy to give them my business."}, {"review_id": "i_A5ILnnozDxSYKiSiZBaQ", "user_id": "oatnKg_tK_X4SU7937b6jA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/25/2017", "text": "BE WARNED - THE COLD BREW IS STRONG!

I naturally ordered an almond milk latte that was delectable. Luckily I made it to my back corner seat without spilling any over the edge of my porcelain cup because I hated to waste even a drop.Nestled in River Market, Quay is a great stop to get coffee before or after the farmers market and typically has a young professional crowd.

These baristas don't mess around and can whip up your customized order without any hesitation or doubt. They specialize and take pride in their knowledge of coffee and product knowledge of this place. Also, this coffee shop is such a neat place to study with an incredible vibe of the River Market consuming you.People might not know the history and significance of the name of this place and how it's symbolic to Kansas City. Fact of the day: The name Quay, French term for \"free alongside\", was applied to the neighborhood in the 1970s by developer Marion A. Trozzolo to capitalize on the neighborhood's early French connections as a fur trading post operated by François Chouteau of the powerful Chouteau clan starting in 1821. Trozzolo's vision was to make this neighborhood a destination for restaurants and bohemian shops. The City Market area when previously known as River Quay was the site of many mob activities -- now is cleaned up and has no known ties to the mob. Not only does this place serve great coffee with terrific service, but it has a historical significance to the area. There will be a line, most days, and it won't be an \"in and out\" kind of service, but the wait is surely worth it."}, {"review_id": "cLYO0jzGPDqdN1cHx9j8PA", "user_id": "ffRPOUFmxrcuoSFUsacEWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/24/2017", "text": "Wonderfully strong drip coffee with crazy-friendly service.Coffee is a little on the pricier side, but is definitely worth it...especially if you're going to hang out a while and enjoy their space."}, {"review_id": "lSzDZwR4LEHcM5g-zdf37A", "user_id": "E37_Co4gt0ZnOU3lSAQxGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2017", "text": "Quay Coffee is a very hip spot in Kansas City, MO.
