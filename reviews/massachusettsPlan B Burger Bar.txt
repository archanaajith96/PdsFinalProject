However, I finally decided to give it a shot a couple of weeks ago.Firstly: I did not find anything wrong with the prices, personally. I felt they were right in line with most burger joints. Obviously chain restaurants offer burgers at a cheaper price, but the quality isn't the same. I did not mind spending the cash for what I got.Secondly: the cucumber chips - opener -(complimentary) that is brought in before our food was amazing! Thirdly: the atmosphere is what you pay for. Clean and slightly upscale looking. The menu isn't absolutely, positively extensive but has great options. Personally it made my choice easier.Lastly: my friend and I both loved our juicy burgers! We had enough left over to take home. And the sweet potato fries were splendid!"}, {"review_id": "IlSqfxy9huam8BsR9RSuOA", "user_id": "2-akantoR4CHAIKNF2P-5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Ordered through DeliveryExpress while staying at a local B&B.

We each had a different type of burger. Everything is good about the sandwich except the meat, sadly. The pretzel bun was fresh and the toppings were good. But the burger itself is not good. Can't put my finger on it. Anyway, the draft list is really good and we enjoyed a few different types. We shared the pretzels-came with cheese sauce and mustard which was good. My husband had a small Caesar Salad-he liked it. The sides were good, too. Fresh chips, hand cut fries, tots and onion rings.  Ashley D. was our server and she was exceptional in every way. Maybe I'll have a chicken sandwich next time."}, {"review_id": "oNl2ziqe3gZOG3_XX_JCpw", "user_id": "qKOWuKXqa_16hmLnbntS1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This was our first time in Springfield. We had an awesome and knowledgeable waitress Belky. We were those customers who quizzed her on the menu and the area and she was very sweet and helpful. My boyfriend had the Baja burger and I had the sheppard's pie. both were very good and fresh ingredients. The music was really loud so we sat outside which I didn't mind. A main reason to come to this restaurant is to have a server like Belky who was energetic and welcoming next time we're in town we will be back."}, {"review_id": "PUyRhk87ZWZ5-Uj4tUc4JQ", "user_id": "J9N2tRRvThvtUg8hVRHR6g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This is a very good burger place in Springfield, Massachusetts.

I came across Plan B Springfield and it had about 200+ reviews. Typically when you see something like this in California you have to try it out. Soo I did. The location was right next to the basketball hall of fame and a cold stone. I loved the location and the ambience of the restaurant. Inside had a bar and a couple tvs. The outside sitting area, which is where I sat, was amazing and really appealing to hang out and lounge around in. I ordered the Bacon Burger which was by far the best burger I've had in a long time!! The bread was nice and soft and the burger patty was cooked perfectly. Portion sizes were good a lot of food and the hand cut fries were pretty freakin amazing as well. Overall it was a great experience and I would highly recommend this place if you are in the area."}, {"review_id": "JHpg8nu1682Pi4F5THykKw", "user_id": "LB1NEhPka2G39yj9R6pA4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Love this place.

Burgers are fantastic. I really loved the hand cut steak fries as well. For an appetizer, we ordered the jalapeño poppers.

Unfortunately, everything was pretty lackluster. The Kentucky bourbon bbq sauce has a good flavor to it, however, the wings seemed to be undercooked and the skin was soggy. The baked jalapeno poppers: the jalapenos should've been cooked longer and I'm not sure what the two sauces were that were included, but one was incredibly bland. They forgot the pico de gallo, there was almost no chicken just cheese on them. Nashville Hot chicken and waffles: These were good, however, they're not worth the price given the portion size. Which can be said for everything we ordered.  Bourbon pineapple upside down cake: two in our party ordered this and it, too, was also underwhelming. The sauce was gritty and they forgot the ice cream so we had to turn around and go back for it. Kids menu - mac and cheese had almost no cheese or cheese sauce on it. It was beyond DRY! The sweet potato fries were just \"okay\". I cannot comment as to how their drinks are as we ordered takeout. Can't say that we'll be back to check it out either."}, {"review_id": "PjwYNtGVFx1f67H6a-TgQQ", "user_id": "Fbio_hP3XGglNvg2fIQzwg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "This place is just OK.  Some of the food was good; some of it was OK, but a little cold.  The beer list was kind of disappointing.  Service ended up being kind of slow too...well, I guess the food took a long time, but the service was OK.I was just driving through the area, so I don't know what the other options are, but this isn't anything special."}, {"review_id": "SYGLk0v_VO6i0HDPqoTrsA", "user_id": "IhmBr-yHC8xLjdnoq7O37w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Was a bit too loud for my taste, but the three stars were for the OK food.

I ordered the west coast burger, with avocado, fried egg, and kalamata olive mayo. I added Jack cheese. Though good, it was a little bland. I was doing alright though,  until a big blob of uncooked egg dropped out. Yeah, I couldn't eat anymore. I upgraded to the truffle fries, which were fantastic. Probably one of the reasons why it got 3 stars instead of 2. Veer selection is good, bourbon selection is good, nice drink menu. The service is what really killed this place. My server was completely overwhelmed in an uncrowded space. Took him 10 minutes to come to my table, and forever for my check. I may try again if I'm in town again, due to their creative menu and proximity to my hotel only"}, {"review_id": "0Uvfk1-civWaSY-ZJ7EIXg", "user_id": "sYr5ugo4FJxU2zgyInyngA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Fabulous lunch!!

I got a burger with a pretzel bun which was a little greasy and a Cesar side salad. Normally when I come here on the weekend there is a very long wait but during the week you get in no problem.

In recent years (the last 3-4) it's really gone downhill in my opinion. The food used to be so much better and really felt like it was prepared purposefully and with care. Now you should consider yourself lucky if your meal comes out hot. I was a huge fan of the Blue Chips and last time I got them they were horrible. Soggy, completely saturated in the bleu cheese sauce, and lukewarm at best. Burger was fine but absolutely nothing to write home about and so messy that I just gave up at the end. I get it, burgers aren't a neat food but a bun should be able to hold up to the burger and it's toppings. It was almost like it was just thrown together. I have a hard time judging an entire restaurant by one server especially because I've gone to Plan B and had excellent service. That being said, the last few times I've been it's just been terrible. I know every restaurant has it's dramas. But to have waitstaff openly complaining about managers within earshot of your guests is just bad for business. Maybe it isn't fair to judge the entire staff or restaurant based on these few unprofessional employees but when a server gives the impression that he/she doesn't want to be there I can't help but think I don't want to waste my time or money at the establishment either. I will say that the bar service has been great most of the times I've been there. I haven't been to the bar in a while but the last few times I went I do recall thinking they had better (more varied) beer selections in the past. Could be because of the increased popularity of craft beers over the last several years - more places carrying assortments of craft beers?? Not entirely sure why the tap selection is so poor now but I do recall being able to get some things I had never heard of rather than the boring (BBC steel rail, come on guys, that isn't even craft beer) stuff they have on tap now. Maybe they've corrected this since the last time I went. I hope so. I wish they would return to the old business model, old staff, and old tap list. Either way I consider myself lucky to have MaxBurger 5 minutes away - while Plan B might still be just okay, MaxBurger still knocks it out of the park. The Miss Daisy burger and truffle spuds are to die for."}, {"review_id": "leoexd4nHL8LqCdZQHzl7g", "user_id": "i1CeN3yc1oJwru8HrfHvvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Springfield has a lot of burger bar options but I think Plan B is one of my favorites.
