It's your perfect local coffee shop. It has comfy chairs and couches along with plenty of tables. It's got a great hang loose vibe. There are so many different coffee drinks to choose from. I just got a house brewed coffee in a REAL mug. I appreciate that. *comfortable chairs*real mugs*nice and patient workersI can't speak to the food but they have  sandwiches, soup, salad and baked goods(from their own kitchen). I was disappointed that there were no vegan/plant based options in the food. That's the reason for the 4 stars and not 5. They did have Plant based milk options. I'm not sure if they cost more. Oh I found it...yes they do charge extra (which is bothersome) .65, .85, and 1.05...I'm not sure why places think this is acceptable. It doesn't cost that much more for plant based milk. I'll just drink black coffee here."}, {"review_id": "tF4asymHI9WjyqYL6G2d0g", "user_id": "w_abncZcDNEIctPj5r1mjA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Quirky coffee house with lots of drink and food options.

I got a hot pumpkin chai with an extra shot of espresso and it was the best chai I've ever had in my life and I've had dirty chai's from quite a few places over the world . I even tried a pumpkin cream cheese muffin and I cried I didn't buy 5 to take home with me . Lemon bar was also delicious. Love this little gem of a coffee shop"}, {"review_id": "3S-X4_Fy5iyZCQcPrDaW2w", "user_id": "aR8cccKx8RaI2Y50ggLJEQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Coffee was pretty good but the barista was unfriendly and rude.

This section of town has really grown in the past few years and some great local businesses have moved in.This used to be one of my go-to spots for studying while in college - ATTN: IPFW Students - this place is a lot more comfy than the library.I usually just opt for an iced coffee or a hot, black coffee. Nothing fancy.Recently one of the employees (male, dark hair, glasses) made me the best tea ever! I was looking for a little boost but not too much before my 6:45pm yoga class. He mixed together a few and it was phenomenal! He even said if I hated it he would come up with another concoction. Service is on point here clearly!They offer some smaller sandwiches and snacks as well. Outdoor space is big! Bigger than I think any coffee shop in FW. Very cozy inside & out!"}, {"review_id": "NLav-_pKZ1U6ohSXSxFu1A", "user_id": "OMWn1Kqsh_Yio8TuH4pMsg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/17/2017", "text": "When I travel I prefer to support local businesses and see the offerings of the local community I'm in. I read the great Yelp reviews and decided to stop on for my morning coffee. Sadly, I left disappointed.The biggest issue was the customer service. The two ladies working were rather rude and seem annoyed I didn't know what I wanted immediately, despite being one of two people in the entire place. Instead of offering a recommendation I just got the death stare until I hurried up and ordered.I ended up trying the vanilla but latte which is basically vanilla and hazelnut. It was a good latte. I also got a gluten free peanut butter chocolate chip cookie for an afternoon snack, which was extremely good! But sadly the poor customer service really made me not want to spend my money here again. I wish businesses especially small businesses) would understand the value in treating your customers well, whether they are regulars or first timers."}, {"review_id": "kXLwZwA3PtqIElpxKAULlw", "user_id": "Lk5ThHP2lgkvOxRUuL36vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Very nice coffee house in Fort Wayne.

I loved the atmosphere here. The decor is eclectic and colorful. Perfect place to study, meet up to chat or catch up on some reading. The staff was super sweet and friendly. They also offer free wifi and plenty of seating. I stopped in on a cold Saturday morning for a hot drink and breakfast. I decided to try a seasonal special, so I went with a peppermint chocolate chai. It was a tad bit too sweet for my liking being that I am a coffee drinker. But I enjoyed something different! For food I tried the bacon cheddar quiche. I love quiche and this did not disappoint.

It isn't butter but it isn't very hot when they pour it and give it to me in the cup. I love the patio and their indoor seating area too. They have little areas to look at local wares and have events sporadically during the week or weekend. The prices are comparable to other coffee places. They also have a cooler case with bakery items and such. Free WiFi for their customers with tables or couches to sit at. It can be a little noisy but that is typical for coffee houses that have a wide range of customers that visit. It's fun to come occasionally but not my favorite place to frequent."}, {"review_id": "mIqtPP92dBrMxMcQvPQOrA", "user_id": "TdsHdUNMbN7mlP7PoHBjNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "Loved this little place!

I'm not even from Fort Wayne and I have to say, I wish I had a place like this near me. There are no cozy coffee shops like this in my area so I'm forced to go to corporate chains (ahem, Starbucks). I love to support this local business whenever I come into town... I probably hit up Firefly at least twice a day! I used to be obsessed with their Zebra Mocha, then it was the Turtle Latte... then my sister-in-law tells me they have coffee ice cubes and I was like \"Say what!?\" Now my go-to drink is an Iced Soy Caramel Latte with Coffee Ice Cubes-- make that a VENTI! My mother-in-law also ships me Firefly's Scotcharoos...

The filling was good but not great.. Even though they did offer a re-make--they really were not very apologetic--you would think that knowing it was our first time there they would've been trying to make a better first impression!
