Must go!Reservations only for 5 or more so go before you are starving, wait may be half hour to 45 minutes but definitely worth the wait and no matter what you try, if it does not have the sausage IN it, get a side, delish!Beer and wine license only,,,,the house Moscato is just bubbly delicious."}, {"review_id": "B108cenA6wjJICwqtIOKCQ", "user_id": "4cZ3f3i0Slv2W9mLN_VZBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "What a cute restaurant. We were seated on their patio which was tucked behind the restaurant, which is in the corner of the strip mall. There is an Italian grocer and gelato place next door, kind of like a Little Italy in east Mesa. Service here was excellent and attentive. Our first waitress introduced herself and told us a bit about the restaurant. It's owned by a husband and wife team and the staff works together like family. We had several servers waiting on our table and it was easy to ask for anything we needed. They started us off with bread an a plate with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. For as much bread as we ate, we all ordered different plates, ranging from lamb, chicken, shrimp, calamari, beef, bruschetta, soup and salad. I ordered the spinach and cheese ravioli in a bechamel sauce and I enjoyed it. It was a good size plate and I was surprised I finished it. I tried a few of the other dishes and liked them, even though I'm not big on Italian food and pasta in particular. We skipped dessert even though some of the choices sounded great, since the gelato place was in the same complex and we planned to visit there before we headed over here. One of the servers who gave us the dessert menus heard me say gelato and said he wouldn't be offended if we went there because it's amazing, good attitude!Overall, a really nice dinner here and I can see why they're popular. Far for us, but it was worth it."}, {"review_id": "JqSLX0l08-M49YI4zpIOrw", "user_id": "hs2TBhQg6jlJ5eYaqj3uCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "I was craving Italian but wanted to try a new restaurant. Tucked into the corner of a small strip mall with private outside dining and a cute Tuscan theme inside, I was happy with the atmosphere. I wanted to try a seafood pasta dish but the menu didn't have exactly what I was looking for but the server was happy to make my dish to order, yay! I ordered fish and shrimp with a tomato cream sauce and my husband ordered the Frutti deMarre (sp?). Both were out to the table quickly and were delicious! My meal consisted of large shrimp and Mahi Mahi. My husband kept saying how great his meal was. In fact, he said that he decided before he got his meal that he would only eat half since he wasn't that hungry. He ended up eating the entire meal it was so good. My meal was the perfect amount of pasta, seafood and sauce and the shrimp and Mahi were cooked perfectly, not overdone at all.I couldn't really give 5 stars due to the lettuce in our salads having pink stalks (you know, the color it gets when it is starting to get old). I also wasn't a fan of the salad dressing due to it tasting of too much oil. I did take the pickled portion of the salad off. Not sure what it was but my husband thought it was amazing  and I'm sure was meant to balance the oil in the dressing.We'll definitely be back to try the Lobster Ravioli."}, {"review_id": "YMeYntISWzrqqxHEYk07rw", "user_id": "625E6pyQ4nkzA1IV-_Ax9A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Went back recently and my entree was prepared poorly.

Really love the risotto norcina. Jon & his staff are friendly & treat returning customers like good friends & family. It's a casual dining atmosphere.

The staff was so accommodating and took good care of us the whole evening. I loved the ambiance and it felt like I was in Italy surrounded by a plethora of shelved wines. We started off with a delicious cheese and meat platter paired with red and white wine. Then we ordered a caprese salad with fresh tomatoes, basil, mozzarella. For the entree, I got the fettuccine bolognese which was awesome and my husband got the gamberi (shrimp)with gluten-free corn penne. Wow for gluten-free, that pasta was seriously really delicious and cooked perfectly al-dente. We finished the dinner with a tasty homemade cannoli! The ingredients were all really fresh and clean which is probably why I didn't fall into a sedated food coma after the meal. If you're trying to find an authentic Italian restaurant especially in the East Mesa area, look no further! Alessia's is legit!"}, {"review_id": "DHUdUsVAJ-mZ4N_QQxTRNw", "user_id": "Vf0hOeEgyN7ba1WOnUxBQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "This is a tasty Italian Food Spot I saw on Yelp, I called in a order of Shrimp Alfredo and thin bread appetizer.

It's without a doubt the best Italian Restaurant we've found since we moved to Mesa from the Chicago area a few years ago. There's a very nice wine bar/tasting room attached. Next door to that is a Gelato shop and next door to that a Italian grocery/sandwich shop with a small seating. We've been sending friends here since we first tried it. We've always had good feedback. The staff is always knowledgeable and they know the menu well.

His personality and his knowledge of both the menu and the entire bar were second to none!  Prices reasonable and food quality outstanding.  And two homemade cannoli priced at 2 for $6 gave us a before bed snack at the hotel!  Thank you, Alessos :for a delicious experience.  Will be back next time we are anywhere close to Mesa!"}, {"review_id": "dMKO-IDweoHazT0VcOfybw", "user_id": "kh1OBvCgtQgqrWvVXLKXPA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "The food was great the bread they serve must have been from last week.

Doors finally open and I came in with a party of 4 adults with 3 children. We sat waiting for our table to be prepared for 17 minutes despite their being a bartender a few feet away (which would indicate they did not work as a team). The waiter was filling water glasses n speaking to other patrons about specials before he finally sat us at our table. It was finally 350 by the time our food arrived (almost an hour after opening). Food was alright despite there being lipstick on a glass. I had vegetables swimming in olive oil, the kids portions are very small. Sausage was bland and the pomodoro sauce tasted like store-bought marinara. Bread is excellent though. Overall you're paying for nothing more than the atmosphere but I would not recommend to my friends."}, {"review_id": "PjR-3xnx1dhHUsoDuK_vxw", "user_id": "DLjX1t_kTKuVtSYaWd6VoQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Came on a Saturday night, was wanting to impress my wife. The hostess said there was quite a wait, as they just finished up a party of 19. We sat in the lobby and noticed there was three clean empty tables off to our left. So, I asked again to be seated. Once again, the hostess responded with her well-rehearsed nonsense about the \"party of 19 that just left.\" Three couples in suits and cocktail dresses came in and were treated like royalty. The manager seemed to know them. They were seated righted away. Sweet Merciful Lord, did you have to make it so obvious? I had to fight the suction to keep from being pulled out of my chair. As a third generation Sicilian, I have never accepted bad or disrespectful service. If they behaved this way in Chicago or New York, they wouldn't stay in business long. They can get away with it in Mesa because nobody seems to care, people act like doormats and simply \"take it.\" Pathetic. As for this Sicilian-Italiano, i pass on this dump!"}, {"review_id": "_l-se0tDZscsFbpcfQl7hw", "user_id": "vnWKs2dgqDuR_yNI5qJG5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/17/2017", "text": "My mouth is still watering when I think about Alessia's.

We shared the gorgonzola salad and the lasagna. 100% best lasagna I've ever had. I thought the lasagna I make is pretty good, but this one blew me away.
