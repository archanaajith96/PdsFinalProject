I went here for lunch and have no idea why I waited so long. First off, the place is adorable. It's in the Fred Meyer strip mall so I had low expectations but the decor and atmosphere are really cute...like downtown cute.I had the gluten free pizza and kale salad. The pizza was amazing. In fact, so good, I verified that it was actually gluten-free. Normally, when you order gluten free pizza it is pre-packaged and not great. This one was clearly made in house and amazing. The kale salad was also great with grilled stone fruit and soft kale (trust me you don't want your kale too crunchy). Can't wait to go back"}, {"review_id": "vczodzayH_UcwCR_O-0Vrg", "user_id": "KmjUYuar9-hSZKNgz8q3sA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "This is one of our good ol' standby spots in Meridian if we want pizza and/or salad.  Both the flatbreads and pizzas are all delicious. One thing I'm really picky about is the dough, and this place delivers a fantastic dough which cooks up well in the wood fire brick oven.If you enjoy a good wedge salad make sure you try their's. It has sweet and spicy bacon with blue cheese crumbles and nice dressings all on fresh crispy lettuce wedge. One of our favorite salads in town!"}, {"review_id": "CHm4aI5wVePdQxMCs-3xpA", "user_id": "ao-AH4CKrHlJLdrxYm9reg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Delicious.

We stopped here for lunch right after. Having two little babes in our group is always a fun and interesting experience and our waitress who is also a mom of a little babe was so amazing and accommodating! They quickly brought out the kids meal (sooner the lil babes meal is ready the better) and started us off with some warm bread. I got the chicken portobellos sandwich with a side salad. The side salad had a bit of cheese and a tangy balsamic dressing. The sandwich was on thick cut focaccia and the chicken and mushroom melted with cheese and pesto was phenomenal! Flavor was great! I would for sure order again."}, {"review_id": "ewon_eF_RTJiJcYtcSubcw", "user_id": "HETv5rNb1GLPezltfM12lg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Lovely place for unique salads and deliciously pizzas.

We have been to the Meridian location but not this one Boise downtown and decided to try it. It's on the 2nd floor of the 8th and Main building, and has a classy, upscale yet casual look inside. We were greeted warmly and shown to one of the tables located next to the best feature: floor to ceilings windows overlooking 8th Street. I believe they open them in nice weather as well. They have a bar that has a couple tv's (extra points for having hockey on!) that looked like a nice place for a casual drink.We each got the Pick Two lunch combo, intending to share so we could taste 4 dishes. My wife got the lemonade which she said was delicious, and I ordered iced tea which more water than tea. The first combo was the Tomato Bisque Soup and Chicken Portobello Sandwich. I am not a tomato soup fan really, but my wife loves it. In the interest of my fellow Yelpers I took one for the team to taste it. It is creamy but not too heavy, and tastes of tomatoes and herbs. It's not bad and the texture is fine- just not my favorite. She did finish it all however! The sandwich was not my top fave, mainly because it was a good 85% thick bread. Awkward to eat, very little filling (I would not have been able to identify a single ingredient if I hadn't read the menu description) and to me very dry. Again, my wife seemed to find it better than I do, but she also generally enjoys bread products more than I do. The second combo was the Tuscan Chicken Pizza (it comes as a \"pizzette\" or individual little one in the combo) and the Chicken Arugula Salad. The pizza was delicious. The crust has the signature wood fired taste, the toppings were in good relation to the pizza. It was a touch dry and had I had a sauce to dip it into I just might have. The salad was fresh and well balanced and the dressing was delicious. My only annoyance is one I have with many restaurants- cut your ingredients to at least somewhat fit on a fork! When you are trying to eat salad and every piece is so big you can't fit it in your mouth and it's a mess, it drives me crazy. It doesn't have to be a chopped salad but just some simple cuts to make it more manageable, especially at a place where business lunches are common (end lettuce rant).The service was good. Our server knew the menu, was very polite and helpful when asked to place an ingredient on the side, and seemed friendly and sincere. Lunch didn't take a long time to get to us, but we lost our server after the food came and he focused elsewhere. It was quite a while before he got back to us and we had to request the check and a box (I couldn't finish my combo). All told, lunch took 55 minutes, which isn't horrible but is cutting it close as I was on a work lunch break. Bill was $28 for the two combos and two beverages, so a bit pricey for an everyday lunch spot but a good \"once in a while\" or \"special\" option. Overall it's a nice little lunch spot and the service was good, the place was clean and inviting, and the food was solid. I would love to see a few more options on the pick two menu geared towards a stronger protein base- like some of the meatball or prawn appetizers maybe, or just a grilled chicken breast with the toppings maybe. I suppose I could try ordering a sandwich without the bread but it isn't the same thing usually as an option that is actually meant to stand alone. I'd happily pay a bit of a \"up charge\" for a solid, lunch protein option in the Pick Two line up."}, {"review_id": "i5St8W2jCKovaCMCG_3-SQ", "user_id": "yrBxqMkCx19SNdd71DpcRA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Love this spot for a quick bite.

They were seasoned well but over cooked. The steak tip sandwich was ok but seemed over priced. Pizza crust was good but the the first one came out burnt and had to send it back. The replacement wasn't burnt but the oven must have been dirty cause there was lots of burnt flour on the bottom so it still tasted pretty bad. I've been to other flatbread locations and they are great. Probably won't be coming to this one again though."}, {"review_id": "ZDiRjLFNLzbeacMi_SW32A", "user_id": "WOYiD0t6W2m1rnv1CcTmRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Visiting Boise this weekend and looked to Yelp for dinner recommendations. This place completely deserves it's rave reviews!  I had a meatball sandwich that had fresh ricotta, peppers, pesto and arugula on it. It was a total mess to eat but a happy mess!  My daughter got an alfredo pasta kids meal, it was huge for a kids meal which she was psyched about. One of her friends got the 'make your own pizza' kids meal, which was literally making your own pizza!  They brought her out the dough with some containers of sauce, mozzarella cheese, and the additional toppings she chose (pepperoni and sausage). Then they grabbed it and put it in the oven. Such a darling idea!!  We were excited to find out they have a location close to us in Sugarhouse, I will definitely be taking my husband there soon."}, {"review_id": "ioWpXKSxyaxIdYPPpXZPZA", "user_id": "4T_cokr3XlVm3iYf847aqg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/7/2017", "text": "Love the atmosphere and (usually) the food, but service last night was really lousy. After waiting 20 minutes for a table on the patio, we were seated and then ignored. I had to go ask for a server. After our food arrived, she disappeared and I had to go hunting for Parmesan cheese, ultimately taking it off another table. We finished eating and sat around ignored again until I went to find someone who could bring us our check and a box. A diner shouldn't have to get up once to help themselves during a meal, let alone 3 times. I had a Moscow Mule and the roasted tomato flatbread. The flatbread was excellent and the mule pretty good, but it definitely lacked the ginger flavor I get elsewhere. My kids had the mac and cheese and it was really oily without a lot of flavor. No side dishes with the kids' meals and they charge extra for milk instead of soda. Next time I'll probably order off the regular menu for the kids so they can get something besides carbs and oil."}, {"review_id": "zik21cjW2I2REnKwee0t8Q", "user_id": "X8vFa4EKdnU6Jw4P3QgqxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/24/2016", "text": "This is one of our favorite places in the Valley.

It's a little hard to find--ok, maybe 'hard to find' isn't exactly right--it's just easy to pass by as their sign is not very visible. Service was prompt and very attentive.

Had half order of their mac 'n cheese (which was ahhh-plenty--I still had some to box up and take home). It's made with four cheeses and is very rich.Delicious...but as rich as Daddy Warbucks, my friends.And, then...on the way home with my darling (aka, the takeout box) riding shotgun, I listened to a little Simon & Garfunkel.And, theeeen...Well, my friends, this is what happens when you pair Flatbread's amazing pasta selections with an overzealous love of cheesy mac, a little geekiness (on my part...not Flatbread's), and the best American Folk Rock duo of the 60's:Coo, coo, ca-choo, my love, Mac 'n CheeseThis girl loves you more than you will know (wo, wo, wo)Oh bless me please, my love mac 'n cheeseTakeout box is filled with you--oh yay--(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoonGoing to locate a pasta plateLaugh about it, shout about itWhen you've got to fuelEv'ry time you look at it, you droolWhere have you gone, my FormaggioMy craving turns its hungry eyes to you(woo, woo, woo)What that you say, my love mac 'n cheeseFlatbread's kickin' mac is here to stay...(Hey, hey, hey...yay, yay, yay)I mean...if a dish meets the \"I want to sing about it\" level of lovely...then, I think it's safe to say it's pretty awesome.
