I have celiacs, so I have to be careful eating out. I played it safe and went with \"The Basic\" which is just eggs, bread, meat, and potatoes. Obviously I didn't get the bread, and was offered some fruit as a sub. I wasn't even gonna ask, I'm just used to omitting that part of my meal, but the waitress was on point so that was nice. Weirdly enough, when the food arrived I got double bacon, no potatoes? I didn't bring it up, so that's on me, but I didn't even mind. Love me some bacon. The interior decorating was a little off-putting. Obviously it's a well liked place, so I'm not about to shit all over their weird choices with the cows and whatnot, I'm just saying it's not for me. And that's ok. For what it is, yeah, eat here. Or don't.

The second time we came here was also for breakfast! I think I fell in love with their New Mexican Benny the first time that I had to order it a second time. An open faced english muffin with turkey sausage patties with poached eggs and a chorizo green chile hollandause sauce on top, with a side of crispy diced taters, and a cup of fresh fruits. The BF order his breakfast burrito and he loves the seasoned chorizo inside. I have not tried their lunch or dinner items but one day I will.

One of the best gravys you can get in town, hands down. It threw me off a bit when they first mentioned how it comes with only 1 biscuit but assured me it was huge. Still, they suggested to add either bacon or sausage. So i added 1 over easy egg. They certainly delivered on a huge biscuit! It wasnt my favorite, buttery kind like i hoped but it was definitely fresh, soft, and delicious!! Especially with their sausage gravy with green onions and my egg!We werent too impressed by their omelette  tho. By far, still one of the better ones we've had around ABQ. Thr way we sees it, we think a good omelette should be more than taco style eggs and filling. It should be really cooked into the eggs and not just added to a pancake of eggs and folded over. The service is top notch however and the setting is really fun and comfty and just the right kind of ambiance one needs for a vacay. Will most likely be back but maybe for dinner or lunch."}, {"review_id": "DFGtQ3vEaD3FUgjJNJn-xA", "user_id": "yR1HEgxVTbBfv1Yg_BuYRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "It's funny to give The Range so many stars because I don't really like a lot of their food. But I'm addicted, yes - ADDICTED, to their green chile chicken stew.Let's talk about this stew, shall we? It's not a stew. It's a soup. It's like a chicken/veggie broth combo with shredded chicken in it with a hint of green chile. Then it has chunks of veggies like potato, tomato, zucchini, and yellow squash. The veggies are what make the soup. They are the perfect combo of cooked to get in all the flavor of the broth while still maintaining the slightest crunch. It also comes with blue corn tortilla strips and flour tortilla. When I am sick, this is the ONLY cure. I don't care what I have. If the zombie virus outbreak happens, I swear this will cure it.

I love going in for breakfast and getting The Kitchen Sink. It is a HUGE omelette that is just stuffed with deliciousness (Ham, cream cheese, chives, bacon, etc). They also have amazing waffles, rancheros, burgers, burritos, .... everything is good. The papas are crisp, the beans are soft, and the food is always good. And, in the rare occasion it isn't perfect, they are all to willing to help correct the issue. However, nothing. NOTHING tops their Creme Puffs. Holy Moly!!!! They are the size of your face, and so delicious. We like to get one and share, but my teenage step-son and easily inhale one all on his own.

This is not the usual run of the meal place. It's unique. The waiter was very kind and didn't mind that I switched out one of my sides on the plate. The desserts look awesome and I'm waiting for my creme brûlée to come so I can know for sure.Edited: creme brûlée was very good, but not my favorite. We came back for breakfast, which did not disappoint at all. I got the kids portion of oatmeal and it was too much to finish. Also had strawberries and lots of walnuts.

Another staple restaurant to New Mexicans. Their first and mother ship location is located in the eclectic heart of Bernalillo, reminds me of Redwood City California. Since opening they have a couple more locations gracing the Albuquerque metro area. They are known for their New Mexican flavorful dishes and bakery decadence! I always enjoy the huevos rancheros served with two eggs over easy, home fried potatoes, and fresh pinto beans with Christmas style chile both red and green....because why just choose one! Soak up your chile and eggs with a tortilla! I also recommend the pesto veggie omelette, fluffy scrambled eggs, spinach, asparagus, cheese, and a pesto spread a top the omelette. The flavor combinations of this dish are superb! Try a slice of their green chile apple pie!! That's my appetizer not dessert!! The staff have always been friendly and super helpful. Greeted with a smile, and warm cup of coffee or rich hotChocolate! Check out the cows too...an eclectic collection of artistic moo moos!!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-range-caf%C3%A9-albuquerque-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
