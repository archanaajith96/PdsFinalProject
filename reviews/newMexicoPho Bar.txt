I have only eaten Vietnamese food once before, at a place in Albuquerque, on San Mateo. The food at that San Mateo establishment was insipid. Because of such a rotten experience, I swore off Vietnamese food for years.But Pho Bar is completely and totally different. We had planned on going somewhere else, but couldn't so we decided to try Pho Bar. I'm so glad that we did. We got there for a late lunch on a Saturday, so seating was easy. I like the Pho Bar on the back wall, it's classy. The service was attentive and pleasant. They were patient with us as we tried to learn a little more of the Vietnamese culture.When it comes to Vietnamese food, it's out of my experience. And I won't even try to pronounce the names of the dishes, as I'd completely slaughter the pronunciation. Personally, I'd hate to dishonor their culture by messing up how badly I'd pronounce their dishes. Fortunately, I took some pictures of the menu, so I can write the dishes we had. I had the Banh Hoi Dac Biet, which has grilled pork, grilled shrimp, pork sausage and shrimp sausage wrapped on a sugar cane. WOW, was that ever delicious!!! My wife had a similar dish, but with chicken instead of pork. I think it was the Banh Hoi Thit Ga Guong. (Please excuse the vagueness of my inexperienced descriptions.) Each of us loved what we ate and shared with one another.This experience single handedly has changed my view of Vietnamese food. We will return to Pho Bar."}, {"review_id": "EfNR-pm_FbITyB__Vyb8HQ", "user_id": "gkUCyghO1V1k7XFnw3h4IA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "It got the craving done.

My Mama always said that Chicken Soup cures what ails ya. I hope she's right because I've been sick for a while now. Last time I got the medium bowl and had a hard time finishing it. Today I ordered the small along with an appetizer which worked out great. The appetizer I had was their chicken wings. They were fried twice to add crispness.

We eat a lot of Vietnamese, as we live in the international neighborhood of Atlanta, and Pho Bar is on par with some of the better Vietnamese restaurants in Atlanta. Foot long banh mi for 5.00? Whaaaaat? Their pho broth is out of this world flavorful, and their bun bowl was good (the spicy fish sauce was a suprise, but was actually really yummy once the noodles were mixed in). My pork was a little overcooked, but that became a non-issue once the sauce was mixed in. The cha gio (fried spring rolls) were REALLY flavorful and delicious, and the Goi Cuon were good. Their green tea was surprisingly good, and I liked the \"personal sized\" tea pots. This is a great no frills Vietnamese at its finest.

Just No! I am relatively certain that they ran out of rice noodles and someone ran down to Walmart and bought some spaghetti noodles to replace them. The sprouts and leaves that come with pho weren't delivered with the soup and we had to flag down the server to get ours. It then took an extended length of time to get them so, the pho was cooling off that whole time. The broth was flavorless, required too much doctoring to make it tasty.

I ordered the small vegetable pho and added beef to it (instead of tofu) and a side of two grilled chicken spring rolls (I should've ordered just one...I was so full that I had to take the other to go).

Dazzler and I eat here about once every month. Avocado shake, any Banh Mi, and Spicy Lemongrass Soup are my faves. Seared Filet Mignon Cubes. Jane had a plate of Cm Bò Lúc Lc (pan-seared Filet Mignon cubes) that was as good as any Vietnamese dish I have tasted. Perfectly cooked and succulent, they melted in the mouth. Crazy delicious.-----26 Sep, 2011-----Ph Tai Nam. I have recently escaped from my habit of ordering ph every time I eat this rich cuisine. For this visit, however, I ricrelapsed and ordered my all-time favorite Ph Tái Nám (rare steak & well done flank). I asked our server to put the rare beef (tái) on a separate plate so I could add it to the soup after it had cooled a bit. This trick keeps the tái from getting overcooked and keeps the lovely beef flavor alive. [Quoc Luu, one of the owners of Kim Long, showed me this trick. Thanks.] The broth was excellent: delightfully spiced and only lightly salty, and the aroma was heavenly. Plenty on rice noodles done just right. Overall, a superb concoction beautifully staged. It may be quite a while before I get to the rest of the menu. I could eat this ph once a week. Or maybe more often.-----26 Sep, 2011-----Spring rolls. There is an extensive selection of spring rolls. The menu encourages diners to mix things up a bit,so we ordered three: Gi Cun Tht Nung (grilled pork spring roll), Gi Cun Tôm (shrimp), and Gi Cun Gà Nung (grilled chicken). Each spring roll comes with lettuce, cucumber and vermicelli noodles wrapped tightly inside clear rice paper and served with a spicy peanut sauce. These are the class spring rolls in this town, and the pork is among the very best I have had anywhere.-----26 Sep, 2011-----Cafe Trang appears on the West Side under the name Ph Bar.. Ph Bar is a new and welcome addition to the growing (31 are now listed on Urbanspoon now) collection of Vietnamese restaurants, and is one of three such eateries on Albuquerque's West Side (the others being Viet Rice in Rio Rancho and Viet Noodle in Paradise Hills). Ph Bar is the class act, and among the very best in the Duke City. AlreadyMy first ph experience (which caused a genetic mutation leaving me helpless with a ph craving about every two weeks) was in a small ph house in Northern Virginia that was populated with dozens of elderly men sitting at long oil cloth-covered picnic benches hunched over their bowls quietly (or not so quietly) slurping this magic concoction almost without coming up for air. Yeah, I know, your mom told you to get your face out of your plate and sit up straight. Well, that ain't the way I learned it in that ph house, so bug off, mom.I have recently escaped from my habit of ordering ph every time I eat this rich cuisine. For this visit, however, I ric relapsed and ordered my all-time favorite Ph Tái Nám (rare steak & well done flank).

Albuquerque now has at least three top-notch Vietnamese restaurants: Ph Bar, Ph #1, Pho Linh, May Cafe, and Saigon 2. Pick your location.

Well, little did we know there was quite a lot of top notch places in ABQ (and Rio Rancho). Pho Bar is certainly one of them!Nice atmosphere (especially for a pho place) and most importantly, really good pho. My wife went for her usual Pho Bo Tai (rare beef) and it was top notch. The broth was flavorful without being *too* rich nor too sweet. And they had a large selections of sides such as an egg. Always a nice way to customize.I decided to venture out a little bit and go for Pho Ga (chicken). I do not have a lot of experience with Pho Ga since I so often go for beef, but I was not disappointed. The broth was similarly spiced with a little less richness but not in a bad way at all. I was initially disappointed in the amount of chicken but it turns out, there was a good bit of it under the noodles. In the end, it was actually a generous portion!This is, more of less, our new standard place for pho.

Since it's not too far away from home and it's a reasonable driving distance without going into Albuquerque. From going out late at night, having a bit too much fun, and the next day needing hot pho to settle the tummy. The pho stands out with their broth, sides, sauces, and the yummy noodles. Personally one of the favorites is the chicken ginger broth with extra noodles, perfect for the cold weather, if you're feeling under the weather, or just satisfying a craving.  It can get busy on some days but mostly on the weekend. You'll see the staff running around serving delicious Vietnamese food. I would say don't be shy around the staff. They're pretty attentive, nice, and the owner is friendly.

This is another restaurant to not be fooled by its location. It's located in a strip mall in a rather desolate shopping (behind the Planet Fitness Gym on Southern Blvd.). The restaurant lacks ambience and could definitely use some TLC and upgrading; so I would recommend take out. But the food!.... oh my goodness. I've eaten here on numerous occasions and I have to say every visit has delivered fresh, crisp, Vietnamese food. My usual order consists of fresh shrimp spring rolls as my appetizer. Rolls are about 6\" long and filling with three medium sized shrimp. Always so fresh you can bite into the rice paper without trouble and the veggies are crisp and cool. I also order the vermecelli noodle dish with chicken. Protein portions are generous and fresh (not salty, not over cooked). Accompanying veggies to the dish are also crisp, cool and fresh. I've ordered the dish with shrimp once; however, beware, they serve their shrimp so fresh that it comes with the legs. I wasn't a fan because it took longer for me to peel the shrimp body parts off and I lost my appetite after, so I'll stick to the chicken. For dessert, I order the avocado shake with boba. It's always a refreshing drink to accompany my meal as it is not too sweet, icy cold, and easy to drink. I've tried the coconut and lychee shakes as well but I prefer less sweetness so I recommend the avocado. Since I find myself here once every two weeks, I'll convince myself to be more adventurous and try a new dish.

Went in around dinner time and the place was at about 75% capacity. No hosts were in sight. After about 10 minutes a guy pops out from the back and says that they are extremely backed up in the kitchen and it would be close to an hour to seat us. He then goes on to say that he doesn't recommend we wait around if we are in a hurry to eat. So my party of 4 along with another party of 8 who was also waiting, walked out. I can't say much about the food, but their business philosophy and customer service are garbage. Who in the right mind turns away 12 people (easily $120 in revenue)? And also why do they not have more cooks to accommodate the large crowds? Sadly, many good businesses tank because people simply do not have the knowledge of how to run them correctly. I might consider giving this place another shot just based on the reviews, but I am going to wait until a while."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-bar-rio-rancho?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
