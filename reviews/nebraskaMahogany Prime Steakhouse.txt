Are there others? Sure, but they don't have the finesse and flavor to their food as Mahogany.I've been to Mahogany a total of 5 times over the last 8 years and each time has been as impressive as the last. When you walk in the atmosphere is perfectly lit and business casual yet not pretentious. The service is probably the best part of the experience. They are on top of things and they work their asses off to make sure you are happy. The food is fantastic. It doesn't need much more explanation than that. The steaks are well aged, seasoned, and cooked to a perfect medium rare. Just remember, if you order your steak any more cooked than medium rare you just turned that meat into a hunk of rubber. Be a carnivore and taste the blood!! Their sides and desserts are always top notch. The price can be a shocker if you aren't prepared. My wife and I usually run a bill of $125 for the two of us.Overall this place is dyn-o-mite!"}, {"review_id": "Gsksaa1s0vQpSFZsgcXBlA", "user_id": "KdRUbbdZ4GxjV4h2BeZH9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Anniversary dinner, asked for a private table and we were put in a little wine room by a waiters' station.  Perfect.We shared a smoked trout spread for an appetizer.  Her French onion soup was great, my crab & lobster bisque was as well.

The boyfriend made a 730pm reservation and we were sat shortly there after. While we were waiting for our table we did have our drink order taken, which was nice. Mahogany also has a coat check which is great this time of year. Once sat at our table, we were greeted by Eric and Nicole who took great care of us all night. Two things of note, when our entrees were brought out my boyfriend's filet was over cooked which was noticed right away by the runner. This was fixed immediately which was a nice touch. The second issue was with our asparagus side which had a long brunette hair included. This was again fixed immediately but ultimately these are mistakes that one would not expect from a restaurant of this caliber. On top of it, no compensation was given for these errors. We were also asked if we were celebrating any special occasions to which we mentioned we were celebrating my birthday. Despite asking, no special recognition or dessert was given after the initial asking. In my opintion, why ask? Despite these small issues, the dinner was GREAT and I found a new love of hollandaise upon eating the hollandaise that comes with the asparagus!!! I also really enjoyed my Chocolate martini and carrot cake for dessert."}, {"review_id": "ej460-xiRqSxlDFxtiza3w", "user_id": "79W0rk2oRngAJp0x_2uQ1g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EXPERIENCED IN YEARS! My wife and I arrived ten minutes early on Valentine's Day for a reservation I made two weeks prior. We were excited to try Mahogany for the first time. We were seated right away at a table in the lounge nearest the front door. I asked to be seated at another table and the hostess told me she need to speak to a manager. There were five hostesses, but they needed to speak with a manager to find us another seat. OK, it is busy...No problem.The manager comes over two minutes later, without introducing himself, and said, \"In the notes for the reservation, you were informed that you would be seated in the lounge.\" I told him that I was not informed of that (honestly, I was never informed of that when I made the reservation or any time after). I also pointed out a table in the main dining area that was not taken and asked if we could sit there. He told me that the table was reserved for someone at 7 (we were there at 6). We could either sit where we were or be finished by 7 at the other table. Ah, I got it. So that table was reserved for more important people than my wife and me. By the way, no sorry and no apology from the manager or anyone. What a strange thing to be told, \"You can sit there, but you need to be done by 7.\" I've never been told such a thing in my life at any restaurant.I looked at my wife to check if we were still on planet earth and she asked if I would just like to go. Since it was Valentine's Day, I figured every other place was booked, so let's just let it go and enjoy the evening.After about 5 minutes of my back getting cold everytime the door opened and then seeing another couple sit down at the table I just pointed out to the manager (the table that was reserved for an hour after we arrived), we got up and left. No one even cared that we left. Even today, no one from management reached out via my cell phone, which they have from the reservation, to ask why we left.RESPONSE TO THE BUSINESS MANAGER: Hi Zoe, so as the business manager, you will pass this information to management? Aren't you management?  UPDATE: As of 3/29/18, no one from management ever contacted my wife or me."}, {"review_id": "E-XpDlE8vtANbTG5WP06EQ", "user_id": "dOfABpD-PA94keA5LlHXNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Omaha steakhouse tour continued.

It was my gift, he got to choose the place and I paid. When we first arrived I nearly fell off the booth when I saw the prices of everything, clearly this is a classy place. He; however, assured me the food here was well worth it. Well... we'll see about that.Firstly, the atmosphere of the restaurant is very luxurious. A beautiful rock fireplace makes a cozy outdoor lounge setting. Inside, the low lighting and elegant interior style give it a romantic feel perfect for date night. Our servers were all very nice. I say all because we had three of them. A little confusing especially because they didn't seem to be communicating well as a team. We heard the welcome speech a couple times, had our drink order taken more than once. Once we moved on to our meal it seemed to smooth out a bit. The servers seemed to be mostly well informed on gluten free which was great. We didn't wait long for our meal. The fiancé enjoyed his salad and the side of bread. I saved myself for the main course that followed shortly after. As they set out steaks on the table they requested we cut through the center to ensure the temperature was spot on. They used a flashlight to verify before wishing us a pleasant meal. That was a first for me and a mark of quality standards. Remember I had been pretty cranky about the price... well, with every bite I felt those fiscal concerns melt away the same way the steak melted in my mouth. The meat temperature was perfection. The simple seasoning was spot on. The sides were unbelievably luscious. The large spears of asparagus with a delicious hollandaise sauce was impeccable. The scalloped potatoes were second to none. We both devoured our meals and still couldn't turn down dessert. We shared a technically perfect creme brûlée with a wonderful fruit medley side.When all was said and done I signed the bill without regret and am already nagging the Fianc to take me back again soon, this time on his tab! Definitely recommend not missing out on this place!"}, {"review_id": "tsh4vXJpkvmvPCEMKQNLEA", "user_id": "p92bJua8G183bI4WGNgMcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2017", "text": "Best steakhouse in Omaha and is definitely worth what you pay for it. Came to Omaha for a week and came here on my last dinner in Omaha and it was definitely one of the best steak I've ever had in my entire life. I got prime rib eye medium raw. The plate was really hot and you can even feel the heat. The fragrance of butter and steak suddenly permeated the entire space above the table. With slight effort, the meat cut open with and I couldn't wait to savor it. The meat was so so tender yet very chewy at the same time. It is beyond words to describe how much each of my taste bud was energized and satiated by the succulency of the steak. Of course, one of the best.Besides steak, appetizers were also decent here. We got:- Bacon wrapped scallop: interesting combination; good balance between tender/light scallop and crispy/heavy bacon- Calamari: standard good, mango sauce interesting- Ahi tuna: half cooked tuna crispy on the outside- Crab cake: two little crab cakes with salad in the middle; decentIn general the experience was amazing. I know the place is a bit expensive so if you really need to pick one, go with the steak (and maybe a side or two).

I had a poor experience when I went to a highly reviewed steakhouse recently in NorCal (where I'm from) . This place does a great job of cycling employees through the common areas and you can tell the mgmt does a great job of instilling the \"team\" mentality since if they sense you need more water or need a plate taken away anyone on the team who notices it first will take care of it promptly. The food itself was excellent I had a bone in ribeye and asked what the waiter reccomended as a side. I wouldn't have ever thought to order brussel sprouts but I'm glad I inquired and took the waiter to his suggestion .In a city that prides itself on great Steaks , it's hard to imagine having a better experience and/or food.

I've changed my rating from 3 stars to 4 because for most it is about the food not the noise.This was our last stop on the \"Fox 42 Steakhouse Tour\" and to no surprise it was the best.We stared off with the French Onion Au Gratin soup, this was an extra charge, but it was well  worth it.  The cheese is so thick that you almost needed a knife to cut it.  The bread is in cubes which I think makes it more enjoyable to eat since you get more cheese, bread and soup in one bite.  The flavor of the onion soup was just right.For the main course my wife had the steak dinner that came with the package an 8 oz filet mignon with a side of Chive-whipped Potatoes.  Her steak was cooked medium rare.  I had the 8 oz filet cooked charred rare with a loaded salted jumbo baked potato and a side of sautéed button mushrooms.  I have only been in one or two other restaurants in Omaha that can can cook the steak the way I like it.  I think the sautéed button mushrooms are some of the finest you will find.  I think the picture of the baked potato speaks for itself. For dessert we split a Crème Brûlée Cheesecake, which is not on the menu, but is offered by the waitress,  It was delicious and ended a perfect meal.I don't think I have been in any restaurant in recent memory that can match this restaurant in service.  It started with the hostess taking our coats,  Brittany was our waitress and she was extremely knowledgeable, efficient and friendly.  She almost made us feel like we were eating at home.  The manager came by our table and others at least twice to see how things were going.  The rest of the staff  from busboys on up, if they saw you needed anything; more water, empty plates removed, etc., took action immediately.  It is obvious that they stress teamwork. The only negative I have with this restaurant is the price/noise level ratio."}, {"review_id": "opw2dMRcJEY2OqOPUuEo2A", "user_id": "7ZXtnIZsR2iOzoI6l9yG2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "High end all American steakhouse.  There are three truly great steakhouse in Omaha and this is one of them.  I'm always pleased with the service and every course.

Mahogany Prime came up as one of the top recommended and highly rated. We decided to try it out on a Saturday night and made reservations through OpenTable. Our reservation was for 9pm and once we got there it seemed as though every table was occupied, which was a good sign for a random weekend night at that time!We were seated right away and were greeted by the hostess and immediately after by both of our waitresses. They seem incredibly knowledgable about every single item on the menu; she was kind enough to make lots of suggestions and even brought a (free) sample of wine when my husband was unsure if he'd like it or not.We ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna ($20) as an appetizer along with a glass of wine ($16) and their Pink Diamond Martini ($12) (highly recommend)! The tuna was beautifully presented and served with ginger, wasabi, a peppery arugula salad and a savory sauce along the side of the dish. Although it was tasty and  everything went well together, I don't get the satisfaction or feeling that it was worth spending $20 on while eating it. They bring sourdough bread on the house with creamy whipped butter, in my opinion, stick with the free bread and save your money to spend on the higher priced cuts of meat! Oh baby, are they worth it!I ordered the Bone In Prime Filet ($58) and my husband ordered the Prime Cowboy Steak ($58). We both ordered it to be cooked medium and they were perfectly cooked! They came doused in an herb butter that was melted and aromatic. We also got a Peppercorn sauce and a Chimichurri on the side. Both were outstanding. The steaks' fat was perfectly rendered and it melts in your mouth! As sides, we were debating between the Mac n Cheese ($12) or the Au Gratin Potatoes ($12). Our waitress offered to bring out half an order of the potatoes so we could still taste them ($6). Both were creamy and delicious; the mac n cheese had a nice baked top but the potatoes were my favorite! They were so flavorful and cheesy I couldn't stop eating them.Once our meal was complete, the manager stopped by our table and thanked us for dining with them. He asked if it was a special occasion and he was very warm and kind in welcoming us to Nebraska. He seemed very sincere and gave us his business card if we ever wanted to plan an event or come back again.Now came time for dessert! As a choc-o-holic myself, their Something Chocolate was the way to go and it did not disappoint!! A slice of layered, decadent, indulgent chocolate cake and mouse with a rich chocolate ganache on the side with assorted berries was insanely decadent but oh so worth it ($10) ....but it was ($0) on the house to welcome us to Nebraska and thank my husband for his service. All in all, the service was outstanding. We never sat around waiting for a refill of water or for someone to clean up an empty plate off of our table. Our final bill was $201.74 after tax and although it was most definitely a splurge, it was by far the best steak I've ever had at a restaurant or steakhouse before! Mahogany boasts great service, amazing cuts of meat, and a welcoming atmosphere that is worth going back for."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mahogany-prime-steakhouse-omaha?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
