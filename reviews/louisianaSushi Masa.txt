The AYCE price can't be beat. The sushi was fresh, fast, and really satisfying. We also had excellent service. We were nervous when we stepped in for lunch that we might be rushed, receive poor service, etc., because of the sheer amount of people there for lunch. However, that was not the case! We were able to enjoy our lunch, and our server never made us feel rushed to clear the table for the next party. It was great! The ONLY piece of feedback I have is to consider better ventilation in the waiting area. There was a very strong, very foul urine smell in the front of house area, strongest around the entrance (and our table, as we sat immediately to the side of the entrance area). It was not a pleasant smell!We hope it was a one-off fluke; maybe a kid had an accident and it wasn't cleaned up or something. Otherwise, a great time!"}, {"review_id": "l0st4KGmikegl4yVG1IhIQ", "user_id": "0iB9FA7dcfzd6eS4-kwyyQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "My daughter had been asking over and over to go eat at Sushi Masa, so I finally gave in.  We had lunch there Sat around 1:00pm, after lunch rush but still a few people there.   That's when I remembered why I quit eating at Sushi Masa, its so slow.  It takes a minimum of 10 minutes for anything and everything to be brought to your table.  We all know the Snow Crab Salad is already mixed and the cucumber is already sliced, why does it take over 10 minutes to throw some of each into a bowl, add sauce and crunchy.  Don't get me wrong, the food is great.  I've never had a bad item yet.  I've tried at least two dozen different rolls, salads and appetizers, everything is good.  It just takes forever to get food and drinks to the table.  I even mentioned it to the waitress, she shrugged and walked off.  The one thing that assures me that I won't be back, ever again, was when I had to track down the waitress and ask for a tea refill, which then took 15 minutes to get.  Bye Masa, Hello Ichibans!  Its not AYCE, but its good, right next door and not slow as dirt."}, {"review_id": "tE7W2aBKrPlFAHzUIoLCaQ", "user_id": "t0HOlThaKHeOxAqDDi7fAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "$25 or $26 AYCE sushi dinner price!

It was kind of busy, and the hostess notified us that it would be a 25 minute wait which we were fine with. The wait ended up being shorter than expected, which was nice.It did take our server a little while to greet us considering it was a little busy. When she did, she also got our food orders in as well which was nice to kill two birds with one stone. We ordered two mai thais and two hot sake carafes. What bothered me was that our sake had old food floating around in them...  We got those replaced, but now I'll definitely be on the lookout for dirty carafes on every future visit.We got our food and everything was consistent per usual including the taste and size of the cuts. We were finishing up and waiting on our last round of salmon and yellowtail sashimi, but we never received it because our server never went to get it since she and the manager said that other people were running the wrong food to the wrong tables. At the end of our visit, the manager did give us a card for 15% off of our next bill and I understand the tactic that they're trying to invite us back in hopes that we get a better experience, but I felt she should've just discounted our bill that night. The server wasn't refilling water until we had to ask the second time as well...I noticed that employees running food to the wrong table is a huge flaw at sushi masa and it really needs to stop. It was bad, especially because I realized that even the manager(s) wasn't/ weren't getting their tables right when running food because we were almost given someone else's food on many occasions. I've been coming here often for the ayce sashimi because it's such an amazing deal, wow. But Sushi Masa really needs a bit more organization or maybe better training."}, {"review_id": "WepcZmPcdYeUEBO0iJdgkg", "user_id": "B1N1R6terH3dL5XdlNMiLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "$16.95 for all you can eat, fresh, made to order sushi? Count me in. Sushi Masa is located off of Essen, in a plaza with Ichiban Sushi and Smoothie King. Parking can be a little tricky, since there's so many eateries for that one plaza. So I don't live in Baton Rouge anymore, but whenever I visit, I always make it a point to come here. They have an AYCE lunch and dinner option, with dinner costing more. I find it more worth it to go for lunch. And if you don't feel like stuffing yourself, you could always just order from the menu like a normal restaurant. Note that this is not one of those grab a plate and try one of everything kind of buffets. You sit at the table and tell your server what you would like. Everything is made to order, so depending on when you go and how busy the restaurant is, you might have to wait a little longer for your food. My strategy is to order everything at once, as soon as I get there. You could always add more later, but order what you know you want so you don't have to wait so long. Just be sure you don't overdo it, since they do charge for wasting food. I'm a fan of everything on the lunch menu. The kitchen is always really fast about cooking the kitchen food, so be sure to order some hot foods if there's a line on the sushi bar. Service is always attentive. They designate servers to certain sections, so I've never felt that the restaurant was understaffed or that I was being neglected. The atmosphere is also pretty nice. They have a section for booths only, and then there are a few other sections with marble-like tables. They can easily accommodate private parties, as there are two small \"rooms\" that are semi-private, or they can easily push together tables for bigger parties. Overall, if you like sushi and if you like to eat, come here. The quality of the sushi is pretty impressive for the pricetag."}, {"review_id": "KBdB4DBkxjSrHRZ0oY8z0Q", "user_id": "BOmM0ce6_ek_9PlpYV24Rg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "We always love our visits to Sushi Masa!

After a day of shopping my sister and I decided to treat ourselves. We were seated immediately and excited about our meal but it took almost 10 minutes to be greeted by a server when the restaurant was nearly empty. After finally receiving help and placing our orders in took another 10 minutes just to receive our drinks. Meanwhile we sat at our table next to the hostess stand watching the waitstaff, including our server, stand behind the front counter laughing and joking about their what had to be amusing conversation.

I can't believe how high quality the fish is given it is AYCE! I've never come here for lunch but dinner is simply fantastic. At this point, I think we have tried nearly everything in the menu except for some of the rolls. My favorites are the cucumber wraps, tuna tataki, snow crab salad, mango salmon, and sashimi (tuna and salmon). The sashimi is downright amazing... I simply can't believe how you can get such high quality sashimi for a reasonable price AND it's AYCE! The kani and yellowtail sashimi is really good too. My wife loves the calamari and we usually sample lots of other apps and are never disappointed. After several visits, we try to avoid the dumplings and fried rice... not because they're bad, but simply because they take up space that would otherwise be filled with the amazing sashimi and cucumber wraps! Soups and salads are all very good and the steak teriyaki is cooked very well! Favorite rolls are double spicy and crazy yellowtail. Avoid the LSU roll because it is just WAY to big! The balsamic tuna is a new item that is really tasty! Over the numerous visits, we brought lots of different friends and everyone LOVES the experience and can't wait to make a return trip.

It has begun. I eat enough to feed an entire village of starving viking warriors. Salmon naruto, samurai roll, dragon roll, rainbow roll, crunchy roll, baby tiger roll... the waitress begins crying in fear at around the 2 hour mark, but I dont have time for human sensibilities. I have to get my money's worth of sushi. I break at some point for an apple martini and to take pictures with amazed tourists and the media, then begin again.

A little too much Imo as I am now running into guys in high school who used to make fun of me for being Asian in an Asian restaurant ironically. Packed and requiring us to wait 20 minutes for a 10 top wasn't unexpected and something you should expect if you come here with a large party. Although I don't drink alcohol when friends of mine tried to order certain bottles of alcohol it was told to us that a new manager wanted to get rid of all the old alcohol that was extra in the back that hasn't been used yet and they will not be ordering new alcohol until the old stuff had all been used. Although this will be a shortcoming for some people...again I don't drink alcohol. The food as always was of a better than average quality and remains to maintain it's great bite to dollar value of 5/5. With 24.95 for AYCE sashimi and 14.95 for lunch  with rice it really is a great deal. However if you're like those frat boys that come in and order nothing but snow crab salad and snow white rolls you're better off going to wahadas or sushi Yama. Know your wallet.

Mostly because it's all you eat and it's fresh. They bring it to the table. But I feel since they first opened its just not as good. The price for lunch used to be like $13 and dinner $22. It goes up $1 like every year so now it's $17 and $26. There are more things on the app you can eat menu though so that's a plus. Food is always delicious. I have heard from many friends that the service has gotten bad so I went last night. They were not lying. I understand waiters work long shifts sometimes and have bad days. But please do not tell me the bathroom is around the corner and then turn your back to me while I'm asking you where around the corner. That is disrespectful and unprofessional. And then she kept forgetting to bring things that we asked for or would bring out the wrong item. We asked for ginger when the appetizer came out so we could have it for the sushi when it came out. She brought us wasabi. And then when I asked for ginger when the sushi came out, it didn't come out until after I was done with the sushi. And another thing, there was hair in the food, yall. I can't make this stuff up. I've attached photos. One photo was for my snap because I'm coming in from Houston so I look forward to this place when I come home to visit family. In the snap, I said this was my fav place. And when I took the photo, I didn't notice the hair. Y'all can zoom in and see it. I saw it when I was going in to take a bite and I pulled out the piece of cucumber so y'all could see it clearer. It looks like an eyelash. I didn't call management or even let the waiter know. Why? For a discount on my meal so they can shut me up? Hell nah. Look at your food before consuming, y'all. The owner keeps changing or something. Management or something. This place is getting more business because of it's all you can eat sushi. But they need to hire better employees. I'm tired of the attitude on these waiters and hair in the food. Maybe they should give the employees fewer hours if they can't work a full shift without getting tired, forgetful, rude, or inefficient."}, {"review_id": "0aOp_o1T4Zh2I0PWuRcJgw", "user_id": "wkeHanFMXAX3eRT5li-YGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/12/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I have 5 check ins here.

One time I came for lunch and I never received the clear soup because \"they ran out\" we weren't offered another soup or anything. When we were checking out one of my co workers asked by chance was the clear soup finished and we were told yes and she asked for her soup to go.........We came on a Saturday and asked for spicy mayo, wasabi, and other things and they came once we were finished if they came at allToday I came in with another co worker. We went to the hostess stand and were not greeted. Another hostess walked up and she still didn't say anything (mind you we were standing right in front of the stand) I finally had to say \"hello we would like seating for 2\" she dryly responded \"this way\"Like I said I may come a k because the food is amazing but I won't have any expectations for the service So I went back again twice this week and Zachary and Sterling both were great.
