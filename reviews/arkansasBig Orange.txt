The service is always fantastic, the food always comes out fast, and the place is clean and pleasant. The house wine is excellent for the price, and every burger I've tried (3/4 of the menu) has been excellent. Recommend: Truffle Burger and Atom Bomb Burger (I like this one with turkey patty). Across the board, Big Orange is phenomenal."}, {"review_id": "-9jM0tCI_SwPeb210myWbg", "user_id": "2_93WZLmyEFAVwDnFpLDoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "Something Arkansas should be proud of Great variety of burgers and friendly service I've tried the chicken and the bees Atom bomb which are what you wound think they are.... huge, filling and spicy Also the Falafel burgers are perfect for vegetarians and have a crunchy vegetarian patty with a soft interior The fires chicken burger is a bit much though .... huge piece of chicken with lots of assortments within the bun that would fill you up The milk shakes are the main star of the post burger menu!

Beautiful area with lots of trees.  I ordered the mushroom burger and my hubs got the cheeseburger with bacon.  Both were delicious.  We shared a plate of their \"State Fair\" fries.  Basically loaded fries.  It was so good!  I wish they had sour cream, because it would make those fries next level.  I only ate half of my burger because I wanted to try one of their shakes.  It was hard to decide, because they all sounded heavenly.  I ended up ordering the Nutella shake and it was AMAZING.  Wish they had this place in Memphis!"}, {"review_id": "IOBwGytP08DHEpog6Gf1dw", "user_id": "DmpyikVIKDwd7MwIkU6xdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Great choice for families!

My husband's salad had blueberries, strawberries and candied pecans. He also had the option to add grilled chicken.

The food is simply AMAZING! It is so delicious! So their specialties are burgers and shakes. Their veggie burger patty is divine. They offer Beef, Turkey of Veggie burgers as an option. Any of the three different patties can be added to any of their burger selections. This is a great option for folks that may have dietary restrictions or those who prefer more than the typical beef patty. The burger of choice, that I fell in love with, was the Hickory Smoke burger. It has sharp cheddar cheese, bbq sauce, pickles, and fried onion strings. Fries are served separately.  My husband ordered an identical burger, but with a beef patty. For an appetizer, the waiter suggested the cheese dip. It was the only that that we had which we did not enjoy. It was a thin and watered down each cheese with chopped peppers. If Big Orange were in my town, it would be my all time favorite. I still dream of their veggie burgers. Someday soon we'll meet again."}, {"review_id": "KqgwGG81EVLmzzfLHguBfw", "user_id": "quxe-8irlkY3M83LKZlfWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2017", "text": "Went to this restaurant and left very satisfied! The burger was great! The beef was tender and juicy. Tasted very fresh. I also had a chance to taste the turkey burger and man that was great also. I also had the chili fries as a substitute for my regular fries and those were also ver good. Someone in my group also had there strawberry cake milkshake and said it was the best shake they ever had. I will be back to this place before this vacation is over!!!

Vinyl records all around, cool retro-looking metal chairs, yet it's not a typical 50's burger and shake place. I didn't even know they had shakes until looking at the menu. Pops of orange are all over the place. Even the straws are orange. I ordered the bacon and avocado burger, which was amazing! They ask you how you like your burger done, which is a good bonus. I didn't like that you had to order fries with your meal separately, though. Drinks could have been filled more regularly. It also was super expensive. My dad, who paid, said that it was just as expensive as Texas Roadhouse, something we didn't expect for a burger joint. This place is great, but if I went again, I would probably just order a kid's burger. It is sizable enough and you get fries automatically (or other choices.)"}, {"review_id": "_1Irrl1PDUuTpIy4BkdtBA", "user_id": "kzshOFb7lPe3kSkb3LO2aQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "Went at 6:00 pm. and wasn't busy yet.  Entryway smelled like a dirty bar mop.  Host sat our party of 5 at the front table surrounded by shaded windows.  I asked to move before we sat due to the extreme heat from the windows.  As host was moving us, the waitress on that section gave us a dejected, angry look with an eye roll.  Food was good as usual though.  Low rating was due to attitude of wAit staff and smell of the entryway."}, {"review_id": "pRREjuJrqL-87bOgjCDe6w", "user_id": "olhya_OeeYQZeldDmWHnPA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/17/2017", "text": "The food was absolutely delicious!!!

It was so good, I had to visit twice in June and again just last week. I think their burgers are the best in Little Rock.  My favorite is the Mushroom Melt.The appetizers and sides that we've tried so far have all been good.Service is normally very good, although they do get a bit crowded on the weekend.  One Friday evening, we had to wait about fifteen minutes to get a table.  Not bad at all.There is one aspect to this restaurant that I don't like.  Their chairs were obviously designed for thin people.  I can't get my wide butt all the way back in the chair, so I end up sitting in an awkward position for the duration of the meal.  Last time I was there, I looked around, but it seemed that all their seats are the same size. (For reference, I am not skinny, but not fat either.)The best thing about Big Orange for me:  It is one place that I can suggest and the whole family is happy to go.  (I can't say that for many restaurants, mainly because I've got a couple of picky eaters in the group.)"}, {"review_id": "OX_1xojrtaK-Y_bIDFGXOg", "user_id": "PlFPd69WmqqLNB76dCX3Bw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "I love the combination of sweet potato fries with mango ketchup, a very Indian taste.  The wide variety of veggie burgers also helps.  Ms. Kaitlin was a very prompt and friendly waitress."}, {"review_id": "PSNTvttdvZ1qJKxiT0NElg", "user_id": "QvRAHI74bJcCD64MB3Rn3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "YUM!

I got the Atom Bomb, and I about cried it was so good. I also substituted for the Truffle Garlic Herb Fries...cried again. I do have to say that they are a bit pricey, but totally worth it.
