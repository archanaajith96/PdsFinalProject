Their steak is so juicy and tender and paired with any of the options of rice, noodles, or banh mi sandwich is so good. The pickled and fresh veggies they use give it an extra flavor and crunch that elevates the meal in ways that I haven't seen other Asian spots do. They also do delicious soups during the colder weather which always hit the spot. The guys working are very friendly and helpful and make sure to accommodate any allergies or vegetarian preference you have. With the option to sit inside the Oregon Wine Lab or outdoors on the patio, this is a spot that I will go to on a regular basis."}, {"review_id": "5220ebghHZSAdu_cTM452A", "user_id": "jB_cy2JiiTuAH2rN1i9_IQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "I just love this place! Let me break it down:LOCATION:Food truck in the parking lot of the Wine Lab. They have outdoor seating with the option of eating in the Wine Lab. It's a nice option when it's raining, and it seems like they've got a good relationship with the Wine Lab. It's close to the Whiteaker neighborhood which has lots of bars, but isn't in a super busy area so you can still enjoy your meal without a ruckus.SERVICE:These guys are so friendly! They love telling you about the different hot sauces they're making or any upcoming specials. They bring the food to wherever you're sitting and always ask if you want more hot sauce, are not stingy with to go containers or anything like that. They just seems like genuinely nice people who love what they do. Also, these guys are the real deal. We came to get some pho one day just to discover that they're in Vietnam visiting family for a month! No wonder their food tastes so authentic. Thanks for bringing some culture and tasty food to Eugene!FOOD:I've heard they win food truck competitions - and for good reason! I actually have only tried their specials (not on their regular menu). We've gone dozens of times for their pho, which has a great flavor to its broth and they give you hefty portions that always result in meals the next day. Like I said, their hot sauces are freshly made and they give you spiciness options for if you want it really hot or not so much. I've also gone for their brunch, which was lovely - got this pork belly egg thing if my memory serves me. I've been meaning to try their other options of that menu too. It's been popular so they're keeping it up, which is great! Today we tried their latest special which is a lemongrass beef stew. Ugh, so good! Seriously can't get enough of this place. I'm excited for the rainy weather to be back just so I have an excuse to spend a ton of money on pho every night."}, {"review_id": "kBKjAwF7eQEThr93ItiUtg", "user_id": "mkZCF6Jk4W_KJyQMRDnJdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/30/2017", "text": "Our first choice for quality Vietnamese food in Eugene. Extremely fresh ingredients, packed with flavor, and beautiful presentation. We often come for lunch on our way home from Saturday Market or whenever we have visitors from out of town visiting the area. This place was recommended by a nail salon owner. He said this was the best Vietnamese food in town with legitimate home cooked dishes made by owners who were taught by their parents. I'm glad I took his advice almost two years ago.Our most frequently ordered food items include the tofu or chicken with noodles and the steak with rice. The vermicelli rice noodles are such a yummy complement to the hot tofu or chicken. You can ask for hot sauce on the side, but it is a lovely addition to the dish. The steak is always excellently prepared and a filling dish if you pair it with the rice. Occasionally they will have specials outside of their regular menu. My father in law tried the pho and it was amazing! The bone marrow broth was so flavorful and rich, I couldn't believe it. Much better than popular pho restaurants in town. Hope they keep this item on the menu! There was also a vegetarian pho version for those so inclined.The staff is awesome, friendly and accommodating. Yes, there is often a wait during a busy lunch hour, but I make sure to never come when I am in a rush. Plus, the outdoor patio seating is so comfortable on sunny days. Bathrooms are available inside the Wine Lab which is right next to the food truck. Bus your own tables. Overall, a great food experience every time I come. I leave feeling full and happy."}, {"review_id": "V-sTS_c3m4-lN1uFqaQ9Fg", "user_id": "s2MfjZEIBWZd98wE3vybpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "Great food, great location.
