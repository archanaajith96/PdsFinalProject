Shout out to Aaron for being great. Fried deliciousnous. I suggest splurging on the crab legs for an app. The oysters were 8/10 but the rest of the meal was delish. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I would have liked a single vegetable not soaked in butter. Also no soap in bathroom. ThafuqMust visit when in Mobile.

The menu screams seafood and southern comfort sides.I visited during happy hour and had a dozen oysters on the half shell for about $10.  The oysters were ok, but would have been better if they hadn't had so much debris and grit. These were not clean oysters and I had to constantly separate the junk from them..I had the seafood cob salad and it was awesome! It had tons of shrimp, and fish that was perfectly cooked. It also included tomatoes, eggs, bacon, and lots of other great items!My server was a 5 out of 5!!! I think her name was Kira. She was super helpful with the menu and the happy hour specials, and kept a check on me with perfectly timed visits!!I will visit Wintzell's again just to dine in her area because I know she will make my visit a great experience!"}, {"review_id": "UmKlmLNbLRDaxTz4G94cDA", "user_id": "ajMm_rBqbKYALu-I8-__Kg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Total tourist trap atmosphere.Seafood boil was mostly sausage and potato.Oysters were nothing special, and advertising as \"Throwaway Thursday\" might not be the best idea for the squeamish?That said, they've got decent parking on a gravel lot, and the staff is friendly enough.

The salmon was prepared very well.  Just the right amount of seasoning.   Unfortunately, the rest of the salad was very bland.  Iceberg lettuce, a couple of onions and croutons.   That was it.  They may want to consider charging a dollar more and making a really good salad.  Add better lettuce, some peppers, olives, maybe goat cheese.   I'm sure they're good, but fried is just not my thing.  The tacos looked really good.  I may try them next time.  Decent place...i would recommend."}, {"review_id": "CPLAPkgF23kJCZLkI7MveQ", "user_id": "YQAuUaywExz29cNzic3LHg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Do: come here any day before 7pm and order their freshly shucked oysters. I just finished dining here on a Monday night and the oyster bar was pretty empty (2 other patrons sitting next to me) so I guess it's a good day to avoid the happy hour crowd. Since it wasn't that busy, Rich hand selected 13 (yes, their \"dozen\" is thirteen counts) large and freshly delivered Louisiana oysters. He said the oyster bar gets really packed on the weekend. They were $15/dozen regular price and 50% off during HH.I also ordered their fish of the day, which was amberjack blackened with a side of green beans and steamed broccoli. I ordered the lump crab topping as a side as well. Do not: order the side veggies. They were awful, I'm talking about the steamed broccoli fell apart when I picked it up with my forks while the green beans were straight from a can (another Yelper wrote about this, too!) I wasn't a huge fan of the crab topping as well. I would have given this place a three star but for the cost of the oyster (on HH) and the freshness of the amberjack, this place secured another star. Also, Rich was pleasantly personable and he knew his seafood! I'd come back again during HH."}, {"review_id": "n5kkE6cPIq3p8BwBQpDbBg", "user_id": "hKXHZdm2HbHWOBECeccEqw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/24/2017", "text": "Came here during their happy hour. Half off their raw oysters and $5 appetizer. The raw oysters are totally amazing. Very yummy with a little bit of lemon and some of the house made horse radish. The appetizer are good. Wings are yummy but they have limited flavors. Some of their meals looks really yummy. Got to try to the salad  with fries oysters; good amount of food and tasty.  Servers here are good. Came to check on us several times to make sure everything was good. The restaurants  is pretty clean and the whole place has a bar type feel to it. Nice place to relax and have a meal.    All in all I enjoyed my time here and will come back if I'm in the area again. I haven't tried other places around here that serve raw oysters yet so I will prolly hop around for that."}, {"review_id": "lOEdxNpUEbXSjfIq7SMVOg", "user_id": "qu83fkCuyS3WdnQAtVZxjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "Great service and good food.

Happen to the cleanliness. We were not greeted, having previously been a frequent patron we sat at the oyster counter. Huge mistake! I have no patience for stupidity or to be correct lack of trained staff. Understandable it's lunch time and they may have gotten slammed but clean up as people are eating and finishing. There were probably four or five plates left on the counter and unopened oysters on the shucking stones. Come on you have to be kidding me Management 101. Cleanliness is next to Godliness especially in the restaurant Business. We were asked what we wanted to drink... Really I told the waiter just as soon as he cleaned this area we could try it from the beginning. We ordered beers and he disappeared for another twenty minutes. Oh no. Huge mistake I asked how much for the beers to pay and we were told by the Mgr she got it. We left and went next door to 5's.

He said he isn't to familiar with the area so his fraternity brothers suggested this joint. I don't think any of us were really hungry but when you working ya gotta eat when the opportunity presents itself because you don't know when you will get another chance. At any rate we were happy to find another eatery that was open in downtown Mobile on Sunday. Place wasn't to crowded, but they were obviously busy which was a good sign. I had the half and half fried oysters and shrimp. One of my coworkers had the fried green tomatoes and grilled oysters. My other coworker just had a peach cobbler. Fried green tomatoes were okay but kinda hard. Sauce was good though. Peach cobbler was just okay. Fried shrimp and oysters were huge, but could've used some more seasoning. Waitress forgot to put the order in for the grilled oysters so we had to wait for those to come out. Everyone was finished eating by the time those came out. Oysters could've stayed on the grill a tad bit longer but we're still just okay. Afterwards we were just sitting at the table discussing how we rated the meal when I kept hearing some weird noises. I heard it and then didn't hear it. I really noticed it when my coworker sitting next to me kept glancing at me with this look of disapproval. That's when we all realized the man at the counter near me was growling. CHECK PLEASE!! My coworker thought it had been me making the noises!! LOL!!  At any rate this place is kinda like a dive and would get five stars after a night of partying and one too many libations!!!"}, {"review_id": "gxcFOWSF8G3VCVKVE_8ddQ", "user_id": "tTqg9LjjMcJRwT_drOOq-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "I'm giving this place 5 stars.
