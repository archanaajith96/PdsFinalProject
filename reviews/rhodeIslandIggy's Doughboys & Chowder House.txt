I can't describe the disappointment, not sure what the line of people waiting for and all the exemplary reviews are all about. Ambiance: beautiful surroundings, the inside of the restaurant is decent. Tables never get cleaned though. You have to order at the window, and then wait for your number to get the food, with some luck you may get a dirty table. Service: friendly, no wait staff checking the cleanliness of the place.Food: mediocre. I tried their two types of chowders - both were good, but not extraordinary. The classic New England chowder was too thick and didn't have enough seafood you would usually want in a chowder. Lobster roll - simple, decent price. Steak and cheese sandwich - simply terrible, the bread was so wet and sticky, the meat was too salty and dry. If you really need to get food in that area, might be an ok option. I do not recommend standing in line, if you are hoping for mouthwatering dishes to impress you."}, {"review_id": "rLqyM86rCQy1xG-Yi8DNFw", "user_id": "ZCPUtrmrI6o6hHU1L1vd_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "Before moving here last week, this place was on my top 5 must try bucket list for seafood. We went to dinner early around 4 and I'm so glad we did. It was absolutely beautiful out with The sun setting, seagulls all over the beach, we ordered our food walked around for 10 mins then came inside on indoor patio for food. Came out 10 mins after that . Hugeeee peice of fish, which was okay in taste to me but so thick and moist. my lobster roll was probably the best I ever had . The clam chowder was just the way I love it. Super thick and lots of small potato chunks and several pieces of clam . So so good. The clam cakes were good as well. I so recommend this place and I hear in the summer the lines are insaneeeee. We then got doughboys and walked around the beach.

Of course I had to order it again second day in a roll but at a different restaurant. This one had a touch of mayo & seasonings. Yummy goodness! Mine was the special which came with cole slaw, french fries & salad. Cole slaw was great by the way! Hubby decided on tuna salad roll with clam chowder (tuna salad grinder special). I didn't try the tuna salad but hubby approved. Clam chowder was excellent better than the day before. I had to share my fries with everyone as it was way too much food for me! I didn't even touch my garden salad until dinnertime!This Iggy's is right next to Oakland beach Seawall where our friends have done the polar plunge last January. Can you imagine that? Where's that hot chocolate & doughboys? I can't do that. I'll freeze to death for sure! Another positive & fabulous experience except for the dreaded washroom!

They're these heavenly balls of fried dough stuffed with clams and when you dip them in the chowder, everything you once knew in life is gonna change. The chowder was the star of the meal, easily one of the best I've ever had. Lobster roll was good too, you can tell that everything is quite fresh!

I was torn between 2 and 3 and decided on 3 because it seems that so many people genuinely love this place so I just couldn't give it 2 stars. The line is insane so they're obviously doing something right. Or, the line is so long because it's a nice location on the beach, the place is a bit overhyped, and Rhode Island has a high population density and there are lines everywhere. Everywhere, people.Anyway, the food was nothing special. The burger tasted like it was from Wendy's. The fries were super soggy (good taste but no crisp). The clam cakes had almost NO clam (super disappointing and left my tummy feeling very uneven). The clam chowder was watery with tons of potatoes and about 5 minuscule pieces of clam. The doughboys are fried dough (I was expecting something better but I don't really know why). By the way, eat that dough fast because if you eat it slightly cooled, all the sugar will be at the bottom of the bag. I can see why people come here. But I cannot understand waiting in that line. Sure, it goes fast. But is it really worth standing in a line with people running around in all directions? My husband and I ordered takeout because we read on Yelp about the crazy lines. I do not like crowds so if crowds give you anxiety...don't even do takeout! Yikes. Also, the bathroom was a nightmare. I certainly do not regret trying Iggy's. It has been on my radar for a while, but unfortunately I had pretty high expectations. I will not be going back...ever...but at least I gave it a shot! Luckily they don't need any love from me because they have got plenty of it. Maybe I'm missing something but I think that's for the best."}, {"review_id": "BbwHUsp2OOtCtZ2p_yXP2w", "user_id": "abg-ICVp7HWCZV7fAgIvAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/2/2017", "text": "This Iggy's is excellent!

Here's my take. The New England clam chowder is a 4 because it's not as creamy as I hoped for. The lobster bisque is thicker, richer, & creamier just how the chowder should've been.  We had the baked seafood sampler platter. The scrod is wonderful. I could've eaten just that until I had to be rolled out of here. The shrimp were very large and stuffed but just a little tough. The scallops and lobster claws were tasty but the claws were also slightly tough. The Stuffies are great. They're large stuffed clams that come with a nice melted herb butter. Then we had to try the doughboys. They were just like a Portuguese donut called Flośe (sounds like flōsh). They were great. And the dipping sauces made them even better. (Chocolate, Caramel, & that great honey cinnamon butter).We had a great server too.
