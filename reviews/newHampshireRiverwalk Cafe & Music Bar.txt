Yup, that's exactly what you do.I got a medium black iced coffee and it was delicious- very strong and smooth. I also felt that the price at $2.25 was more than fair; I am so accustomed to paying over $3 for iced coffee which, when you think about it, is ridiculous considering it's at least 50% ice. Anyway, Riverwalk's iced coffee is good and the male barista (Brandon?) didn't give me an entire tray's worth of ice so I'm a fan!  I also tried their vegan, homemade peanut butter cups which were so good! When I got in the car there were two in the bag when I only ordered and paid for one I think; I'm not sure if two are included in the price of $2.25 or if Brandon is just a cool dude, but I was psyched. They were so good and paired perfectly with the coffee.They also had some truly interesting desserts on display. I had to pull myself away from the glass case before I ordered a piece of their cinnamon roll cheesecake for a little over $6. I'm still thinking about going back to try it.My one gripe? They flavor their coffees with Monin flavor syrups which are so gross. If they brewed their flavors I would be back everyday!"}, {"review_id": "R16i2iUqugtXnao2qH8DCA", "user_id": "3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "All the hip, laid back, cool cat vibes going on here in this eclectic, uber chill downtown cafe with tons of personality and mixed match furniture and art. I knew we would dig this place the second I noticed the Dylan lyrics hand pained on the walls. Came for some caffeine and breakfast items for the kiddos before hitting up the annual Pumpkin Festival. Their house made buttery biscuits are apparently the thing to get...and so we did. They are offered stuffed with many different options, but the my little vegetarian ordered the simple egg and cheese and asked for tomato slices also. She loved her decent sized sammy!House made Greek yogurt parfait was ordered for my eldest and equally enjoyed! I love that mostly everything is made from scratch here!The peanut butter cup almond milk latte I indulged in was really something to remember!!  If you're looking for a special caffeinated treat, and dig the candy, this is cup is what you want to get. It was unreal!! Perfectly smooth and peanut-buttery. Yum! There are a few vegan and gluten free items available. Beside the wide variety of classic and unique cups of joe (ex Autumn Cold Brew special infused with nutmeg and cinnamon), the dozen loose leaf teas, there's also a full bar and local beers on tap! Coffee AND booze? Love it! A ton of breakfast items and even more lunch options. A great place to kick back and nosh anytime of day really.  We loved our stop here and could've just hung out for awhile. Many different cozy seating areas and places to just sit and relax. Some folks were getting work done. We'll be back the next time we're in town for sure. Maybe to catch one or the live music acts they host. Check out the schedule on the restroom door!"}, {"review_id": "1XhaQfXmcVeG9SoRv5JCRA", "user_id": "0-H9ASZU3JtiI5QNM1abbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/19/2017", "text": "Stopped in to veg out after work. The atmosphere is intimate and eclectic, otherwise comfortable and inviting. Sitting upon the beat-up leather sofa whilst enjoying a breakfast burrito and mango smoothie had been the most relaxed I had been in days by the time that moment had come.The burrito was delicious with the feta (highly recommended) and piping hot when it came out.Counter service here. Polite staff. Friendly patrons. A chance to unwind. A chance to forget. A moment to stop. This was a much needed reprieve that morning I visited.

Wanted to go for dinner but didn't go and ended up going the next day for brunch. They have a limited breakfast menu but got the feta and the morning kick. The feta was good with the pesto but a little bland. The morning kick was amazingly delicious on the other hand with the jalapeños. The bread was fresh, flaky and really good. Got Bloody Mary and mimosas, they were pretty good although more expensive than the food themselves, were around 9-10$. Overall great place with a great ambiance and great music. Def recommend this place if in Nashua."}, {"review_id": "lcrMIZWYqtHoaTNcyEOnQQ", "user_id": "5FMOrEqlvoN4k6J9cPfj8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The coffee is really good and sandwiches are too. I like the monster breakfast sandwich and the chicken ruben (made with slaw instead of sourkraut) best. Their offerings are limited because of their kitchen so remember that this is a coffee shop with culture, sandwiches and music not a breakfast or dinner restaurant.  The staff is kind and helpful, there is ample seating and they frequently have live music.

Feel free to push those into the cream cheese so the sandwich doesn't loose it's needed salt, please.All in all, it was a very pleasing experience and I will definitely be returning."}, {"review_id": "Wcd4Y9Cmug8a_L9i-lR8Sw", "user_id": "qw5B2A9TefceFf47nXNB7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Great coffee and brunch spot but also excellent music on a regular basis.

Whether it was early morning research or late evening paper writing I could always count on a great coffee and bite to keep me going. I've had adult beverages here during some live music performances as well and I have yet to be disappointed. The Classy Shroom sandwich and Toffee Lover's Latte have been longtime favorites of mine. I'm always happy to dine inside the cozy atmosphere or outside on a sunny day. One downside is that the parking can be tough during busy daytime hours and on weekends but I can assure you, the raspberry bars and other bakery items alone are worth it. I also have attended some of their mini craft fairs which display local artists' work and I think that has been a nice added touch. It is a place where I would hope everyone feels welcome to come unwind and enjoy good food, drink, music and art."}, {"review_id": "AdHLE92ihcDAGNnxuLRTcw", "user_id": "AjmV1ZZ5pZ_fdRznjZyrnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "I wish the parking was easier so more people could go here.
