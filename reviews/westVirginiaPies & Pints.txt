The pizzas are great (of course) and the salads are extremely underrated. Best salads in Charleston! Very casual atmosphere with awesome service from hosts to bartenders to servers. On weekends the waits can be a bit long, but you can head over to the bookstore to wait it out. Definitely the best place for food on Capitol St!"}, {"review_id": "_lAtTgmDE5RSVwpO5h70lQ", "user_id": "XNBvYEhqboT5z_i_0pN4cQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Pies and Pints is as good as they come for craft pizza and good beer. We had the wings to start. They are dry rubbed and served with a Gorgonzola dip.  Not bad.  There was seven of us so we got three different pizzas for dinner.  We had the margarita, the Pine and Swine, and the steak and mushroom.  All were really delicious. The crust was nice and thin and the toppings were plenty.  They have a great beer selection. The atmosphere is inviting and comfortable and suitable for everyone. Pies & Pints is a must."}, {"review_id": "HkuVbW69FVuPBLRgaigj1w", "user_id": "v62qDWCu_Pf7_gzlEPBZUA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Ah. May. Zing!

Always ask the slice of the day! The grape and gorgonzola cheese pizza is delicious. You cannot go wrong with any of their pies. The char grilled wings are a must!!! Some of the best wings I have eaten. The garlic cheese bread is yummy too.  Salads are large and delicious! I love the Greek salad! Root beer on tap yes pleaseThey carry a lot of WV craft beer and other great choices if you are in need of a brew!

Great atmosphere, creative pizza toppings, and large selection of craft beer. The large Greek salad can very easily be split for 4-5 people as an appetizer. Favorite pizzas include the Cuban pork, sirachi shrimp, and the Mediterranean.

The pizza here is phenomenal. I didn't go for the famous grape one because I'm not a fan of Gorgonzola cheese. The second most recommended was the chicken Gouda but I'm not a fan of Gouda either lol I'm really not picky but bold cheeses aren't my thing. I went for the Hot Mama and I loved it. The crust is crunchy but not too thick or hard at all. The other thing I must give props to is the salad. I tend to get house salads a lot at the beginning of meals to make me feel better about what I'm about to eat for my main meal. However, for whatever reason, all these places in WV think a salad is a bowl of lettuce with a slice of onion and tomato. The house salad here was definitely much more substantial and tasted fresh as well. I'd recommend it. There's a ton of beer selection here and a wide variety of options as well, love it! There's indoor and outdoor seating as well as bar seating inside. Last thing to note is that parking is terrible. Never have I been to a major city that is so primitive with its parking system. All the street parking is metered and only takes change. I found one parking garage close by that accepted credit card. Ridiculous!"}, {"review_id": "vFkrYcbmlz61c0iXUMdk3g", "user_id": "r5WO8TRsKL5N3A09JSsgRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/23/2017", "text": "Pies and Pints definitely leads the foodie scene in Charleston. They birthed and raised the idea that WV can support a local, adventurous restaurant. You need a bit of time for your ordering since they can often be packed and service is slow, but you'll be rewarded with some great pie. I was introduced to the pizza skins this time and holy shiiiiit, it was awesome. It's literally potato skins on top of pizza. Ask for bacon on the side, because it goes perfectly. They also have black bean pizza which breaks most pizza rules, it is surprisingly good. I mostly stick with the classics, but you can afford to mix it up when you do a half/half large. It's two pizza flavors on one pie."}, {"review_id": "d3UnANbz8iV9Y4SR6C22eQ", "user_id": "g2cnhlyH0lnLu2-A6IrGLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Best pizza for 50 miles.  Great atmosphere and good beer selection.   My favorite is the White Pie with pepperoni"}, {"review_id": "jO3Xci0noaiOmgeIxyaXXg", "user_id": "MnMn2IrSdxbacsw1Wgm9FQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "The gluten free pizza crust seemed crisp on bottom, and under cooked at the top - this is something I'd suggest to work on.

It's very trendy & the staff go above and beyond to ensure your experience is the best. Once the appetizer was finished we waited a while for our pizza. Our waitress came out & told us she had forgot to put our order in. I truly appreciated the honest. It's easy to blame the kitchen. She was very apologetic & gave us a discount on our meal. I was impressed with the whole situation!Now onto the food... WOW. I've tried a few of the different pizzas they offer & I have never been disappointed but nothing compares to the heirloom tomato pizza. This pizza is seasonal because they only serve it whenthe tomatoes are in season. So get it while you can! It's phenomenal."}, {"review_id": "S_bfLBK9LY4ACnL_STMLFQ", "user_id": "F32HoUrTL3n1hGFSV33e8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/8/2017", "text": "The place is awesome just like you would expect from a pies&pints.

They were very good but the oddity was that some of the wings were cold and some were just warm on one side.  We skipped lunch that day so we munched on without complaint.  By dining companion also ordered the wings and he had the same experience.The main course was unbelievable.  I ordered a gluten free margherita. It was absolutely, positively, the best gluten free crust I have ever had.  Owners - I beg of you, please share the recipe with me.I cannot wait to return!"}, {"review_id": "cFVFpg5aHDmsHa8Px8lxRQ", "user_id": "ED47FcBeZRsnUl-QxQXLFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/30/2017", "text": "Great dinner experience in Charleston!

It's cheaper to do a half and half large than to order two smalls if you're trying to have a variety of pizzas.
