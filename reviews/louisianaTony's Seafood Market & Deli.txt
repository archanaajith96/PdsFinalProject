I will admit, the location could be a little better. The roads getting to Tony's are awful, the parking lot is small (and it's almost always crowded), and I fear for my car every time I go here. But Tony's is that good that I'm willing to risk it and drive the distance. There's usually an officer in the parking lot. Tony's is located off of Plank Road in its own lot, next to La Fish Fry and across the street from Roul's Deli and Raising Canes. I have yet to purchase anything from the Market itself, but from what I can see, the prices look really good. I come here for the carry-out from the deli line and I've had just about everything and have yet to be disappointed. They have lunch specials that change depending on the day of the week, they have seafood boxes (sizes in L or XL) or plate lunches, po boys, burgers, boudin balls, and desserts (bread pudding, various pies). They have jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and gumbo at prices cheaper than you'll find at any restaurant. The food tastes so fresh and just like a good, home-cooked meal, but definitely better. So to order, you go through the line and just tell them what you'd like. For certain things, like the fried seafoods, they'll make it fresh in the back and if that's all you want, just tell them, then go straight to the end of the line. They'll give you a ticket with your order number. Wait for it to be called and get your food. For all purchases here, you just get your food and go to the front cashiers to pay. Note that there is no seating and it is carryout only. If you'd like a beverage, there are fridges right next to the deli line. Overall, I have always been pleased here. They're fast, everyone is friendly enough, and for the price and quality of the food, you really can't beat Tony's. Tony's is my comfort food, my treating-myself-out food, and my treating guests out food."}, {"review_id": "NN4kCuwDAUwxCNhEu_ookw", "user_id": "q_9coD9W6ihmhX9i_Ce6gQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "This is a must if your coming to Baton Rouge or you live in the area. This place has been a major staple in our area since 1972 in the same building and still kicking strong. This is the go to place for fresh seafood of any kind. You can get whole lobsters, oysters, black drum, salmon , snow crab, redfish, and many other seafoods. They also sell plate type lunches which range from $7.99-14.99. They have baked fish, red beans and rice, eutoufee, fried catfish, fried shrimp , bbq plates, hamburger steak, and many other yummy entrees. They also have a separate line for poboys, sandwhiches and platters. You can buy live and boiled crawfish. They have a great frozen section . They have boudin balls that are yummy. So if you have never been to this local gem you need to check them out!The reason I didn't give 5 stars is the ladies in the lunch line at the end can be quite rude sometimes and sometimes at the pick up area. I think they could work on that issue!"}, {"review_id": "-2em7uhnjTs5biK0feVGyw", "user_id": "b8SWcnxNL_czKgvRbzP0Mg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Great spot to pick up and I do emphasize pick up some good seafood eats when in the area.Star taken off due to iffy area of town and no where to sit and eat which arguably disqualifies it from being a restaurant. On the food side you can get all you want already prepared pretty well or from the fresh seafood case as well. Also a small grocery style area for other fixings you might need for home cooking. Stopped in again the other day but left when we were reminded they had no seating.

They have a number of hot food items to choose from which you could easily over stuff yourself with, but you won't have any regrets in doing so. They have a ton of other items to get including fresh seafood.Since we stopped here while driving back to Austin, we went with only their hot food. We got their Jambalaya, which was great, Crawfish Étouffée, which was very good, their Catfish Seafood box which came with sides of your choice. We chose their Collard Greens, which I was a big fan of. They had an unexpected sweetness that worked really well. We also got their Mac n Cheese, which was pretty standard, and a piece of Corn Bread. The Corn Bread was a bit dry unfortunately, but everything else being good easily made up for it.Prices were super fair and service was quick and efficient. No doubt I would come back here again when in the area."}, {"review_id": "ZTXbBgGJnpf57ls5IXBSwA", "user_id": "J9tSo1YQLym7T8iuU68UPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Everytime I visit Baton Rouge I make sure to stop by Tony's. Probably the freshest seafood you can get anywhere in Louisiana. My go-to order is the lunch plate with fried catfish, collard greens, cornbread, and a side of jambalaya. Hands down the best catfish I have ever had in my life. The Jambalaya is packed with flavor and pairs great with the fish. Simple, yet so good. Even though I was raised eating mostly Asian cuisine, Tony's will always be my ultimate comfort food. I would say Tony's is worth the trip from Houston alone. Only downside is it's always bustling and lines can get pretty long, but that's just a testament to how good the seafood is."}, {"review_id": "YAwP8JDqSY7rZHKF-InMKA", "user_id": "ZzhThUUZg5_rwZkzimHOrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "When my time on Death Row is done and they offer me my last meal, I wanna have an all-you-can-eat experience at Tony's.  Introduced to this place by my local aunt, we make a point to stop here coming AND going to New Orleans.  I visited here several years ago with a buddy and we ate here twice a day for 5 days.  The workers came to know us by name.  The boiled crawfish and shrimp can't be beat and I just can't narrow down my favorite selections at the buffet line.

Catfish tony is two filets of catfish smothered in crawfish etouffle. Comes with two sides and a choice of bread- I chose mustard greens and dirty rice and I can just die and go to heaven right about now. The would probably pay 10 dollars for just the sides alone and be happy but this is the south bae- you get it all for ten dollars. I looked at the popular sit down joint and it looks amazing, but dude- I paid 50% less for even more food so if you're not against eating out of a foam box, just do this. Oh- and all the amazing Louisiana food products here; they have it all. From whole gator, to crawfish tails, to frozen boudin balls (and fresh!), hot sauce, zapp's, pralines, even a Louisiana shaped gift box with all types of goodies.

The lines are usually long, but they get you right in and right out. The food ranges from around $8-$15 depending on what you get. Some items are add-ons so it can get pricey if you're greedy like me. This time I ordered the catfish, and shrimps with dirty rice and mac and cheese. You also get a bread(garlic, regular roll, or cornbread) with your order. The food is a great representation of good ole southern Louisiana food. Every bite is memorable with everything being seasoned to perfection. This place is well staffed with nice employees as well. I wish there was a place to eat inside, but it's still worth it.

No sit down so it's a grab and go which is fine for me. I probably ate all the boudin anyway on the way to the car. Krispy Kreme is down the street so get ready for a fun time. The boiled shrimp is perfect and they even have drinks and other little snacks to nibble on.

There's parking on the sides and fresh seafood, cooked seafood, and seasonings. They also have frozen sausage, okra, and other items in the freezer along with drinks. I tried the seafood to go and it came in a box. Unfortunately, the food loses its freshness after being boxed, so I recommend you eat it in the parking lot or somewhere quickly before the food settles in the box. There were also a ton of people! Of course, I also went on Christmas Eve. The takeout line takes the same or longer than the cafeteria style line. I suppose they cook it fresh in the back, making it take longer than the line (which looks pretty long). All the fried foods taste pretty good, love the oysters!
