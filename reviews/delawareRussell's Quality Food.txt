I decided to go.. Russell is so down to earth! I did call before I arrived and got the voicemail. I am sure they were assisting customers. I still went and yes there were some people in line. The wait was not long and Russell was so nice.. I believe I was there 6 minutes max..  I am actually thinking of going back as I write this review.. (I wonder if they are open) I can smell the food!!! Ohh gosh it was soo good!!! Fall off the bone good!! I'm going back now!! Ps.. Yelp this needs 10 stars okay.."}, {"review_id": "YkKEK4B6bTZLsRTeY0Uv9A", "user_id": "EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "The ribs were good. They had a smoky and sweet flavor impregnated into the meat. The meat was charred and crisped well. The bbq sauce was sweet and tangy and savoury. That was very good, The pork meat was not perfectly executed. It was not fall-off-the-bone and retained a stick on the bite as well as a toughness that comes probably from cooking too quickly. The lack of pork flaking on the bite indicated the meat was not well-cured or brined. The fat was smoky and tasty, but did not melt on the tongue. I was unimpressed with the cole slaw. It tasted like it came from a large plastic Sysco vat. The sweet potatoes were more unique and complexly flavored with smoky and sweet notes. Russell's was a pretty good stop for ribs. But, I've had significantly better."}, {"review_id": "4cmzbj2FUszadX4TDT537A", "user_id": "CdmQfB4-zWqm00ZAufloFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Amazing food. Get there early or he will be out of mac and cheese and then you'll be sad. Don't miss the mac and cheese. The greens were good too (I don't know what he puts in them but they were seriously the best greens I have ever had - no bitterness at all). I usually get the pulled pork - I always think about trying other things but then I am afraid I will be sad that I didn't get the pulled pork. The sweet potatoes are good too. And Russell is very very nice.And this is a take-out place. It's a small trailer in a parking lot (basically a food truck without wheels).  There are a few picnic tables but it's across from WalMart and next to Delaware Brick so not a ton of ambiance. Should not stop you from going there but just realize it's strictly take-out.Fridays is brisket day.

Unlike the typical chain restaurants that serve BBQ, this is a food truck that uses an outdoor grill to prepare the meat. This results in a wonderful smokey flavor that is infused into every bite of meat. There are several types of meat to choose from - I have tried the ribs, pulled pork, and chicken.  Among the three, the ribs stand out by far with its ability to capture the smokey flavors. All options come with a delicious BBQ sauce, which they also sell separately as well for those who want to try duplicating their BBQ dishes at home. I have never eaten such delicious BBQ meats before I met Russell's Quality Food! This place also offers a great value for your money - the platter comes with plenty of meat, bread, and two sides. Enough food for two people for just $10! As for the dining experience - there is a little table that can be used if you would like to sit down and eat the food. However, meals purchased from here are best enjoyed as a meal at home or for a picnic at a nice park somewhere. Considering how many times that I have been willing to make the drive here to grab some BBQ, I really, really wanted to rate this place five stars. However, there are a couple of things that this place can improve upon: 1) Consistency in service - one guy is extremely friendly towards the customer, but the other one could use a little more training on customer service in terms of communication, remembering to give utensils/napkins, etc. 2) Availability of sides - Usually there is only two sides available at most. I like the mash potatoes and macaroni and cheese the best, so I hope that if they are only able to make two sides that they would choose to make those two! 3) Meat availability - I am not sure how they decide what meats to cook for the day or when to start preparing food, but usually only a couple of meats are available at any given time. Also, they seem to have different availability depending on the time of day/ day of the week. I have visited on two different Saturdays. One Saturday, they had ribs available around 10am. However, I came back on another Saturday even later on during the morning, and sadly discovered that meat won't be ready for another 45 minutes. I think that they will get more business if their meat availability was more consistent, and if the food was ready to be served during all opening hours. Overall, this is a diamond of a food truck, and I cannot recommend this enough for all the BBQ lovers out there!"}, {"review_id": "JMWct0fEj7Ca6se8CaR7yQ", "user_id": "J-SrJeEyrJ1lfE0o3Rcoqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "My husband loves this place.

We tried the pulled pork platters and being sweet potato fans chose a double order of the sweet potatoes for the sides. The pulled pork was moist and juicy and full of nice sized pieces of meat that were not at all fatty. The sweet potatoes were deliciously smoky and buttery. Each platter was served with a roll that sopped up the juices and the meals themselves must have weighed several pounds and made great leftovers. Granted I can eat a lot but there was no way I could finish my platter despite how great it tasted.Russell's friendly assistant (Ed?) was really helpful. I would rate the food as four stars but the friendly service bumps it up to a five.  We look forward to coming back soon!

Located in the corner of a parking lot, Russell's consists of the one-room stand from which Russell takes orders and makes food. Outside the stand is a large grill and oven in which he cooks certain of the delicious items one can order.On my visit, I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I grew up in New Mexico, and we get a decent amount of barbeque from the prevailing Texas headwinds, and I'm a fan of pulled pork. For six dollars, I was not disappointed. The styrofoam to-go container that Russell handed me contained a fresh bread roll and a heaping serving of pork, drizzled with barbeque sauce. There was so much meat I could only fit half of it in the roll and had to ask Russell for a second one to finish it.The meat was delicious, smoky and just chewy enough. It fell apart gently with a little prodding but still had the perfect consistency in the mouth. I washed it down with a can of soda, which Russell offers for only fifty cents, a bargain in this day and age. My friend and I ate our meals sitting at the picnic table outside the establishment, and he was similarly pleased with his hamburger and french fries.I plan to return to Russell's to try the rest of his menu, such as the hot dogs and fish sandwich, which I'm sure he does well. For my first visit to this establishment, I had a great time and would recommend it to fans of pulled pork and cheap, quality food in general."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/russells-quality-food-wilmington?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
