Went here on Christmas Day for lunch with the bf and his Dad and we enjoyed every bit of our meal. We got the samosas to share for apps and they were perfect! For mains, we got the larb with chicken and the coconut noodle soup with tofu. I'm a vegetarian so didn't try the larb, but the bf and his Dad really enjoyed it. As for the soup, it was one of the best soups I've ever had. The richness of the coconut milk broth with the exotic spices added great flavor to the tofu, and the fried chickpeas were a perfect textural element to the soup.Overall, Mahnin is making great food and will definitely go back here the next time I'm in Fort Wayne!!"}, {"review_id": "rrhNkS2D352xyN-BGdmOzA", "user_id": "7j8EGDqlF-F_0-JF4g12VA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I've been eating Mahnin's food since before she opened this place.

I didn't realize I left it blank on Yelp. First off, yes, I've been to Thailand. Second...this is the real deal. One needs to know that it's also regional if your looking for the basic Pad Thai in peanut sauce. I live an hour away and hit this place maybe once a month or so. The Kuit Teow is the go to dish for me as I like huge noodle bowls. The broth is to kill for by itself. In traditional Thai method, the condiments are on the table to enhance your dish. Ask a waitress to show you how. The joint is across the street from, you guessed it, a Thai-Burmese grocery store. The joint is small with a row of booths and a few tables in the adjacent dining area. It's randomly decorated and set up for people who want to eat good food. This would be right off the block in Thailand. For me to toss out 5 stars at a place that is off the beaten path, in a less than stellar neighborhood is saying a lot. Give this joint your full attention if true Thai-Burmese food is on your mind. Maybe I will see you there."}, {"review_id": "rBnHnJuI_mWnkVM2B5Z6tA", "user_id": "kKYhWSuTJHBzV8ZOORtxrQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "If you like chicken pad Thai this is your spot!

If you plan to visit for dinner, I recommend stopping by in the early PM.  Mahnin closes at 8 PM, but we noticed the owner locking the door around 7:20 PM-7:30 PM. We think she was overwhelmed and they were running low on appetizers and other items (since everything is freshly made in-house).  The atmosphere is okay, a mishmash of tables & booths crammed into an awkward space (former mechanics stop/filling station). I tend to pro-rate Fort Wayne restaurants against Indianapolis, so a 5 star restaurant in the Fort would be lesser elsewhere.  However, Mahnin feels like a true 5.  The deliciously-complex spicy food superseded any atmospheric issues; go there for the food, go early, and try something new (no pad thai!)."}, {"review_id": "EulDcL8LMCbN_ItJjJl2bA", "user_id": "K5vA58EvuN87CQbuRBCiaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2016", "text": "This has become my go-to Thai place. It is conveniently located near my office and home - double score. Thai for lunch and dinner! I usually prefer the carry out to dining in, but recently I ate in with a few friends. This place can get pretty packed during lunch....seems the other downtown-working Thai lovers have discovered Mahnin. Service was decent considering it was one girl running the whole show. Answering phones, serving, and running in and out of the kitchen. I have tried their Pad Thai and Pad See Ew. Both are phenomenal. A little heavy on the grease sometimes, but still simply delicious. When dining in, you receive a soup with your meal to start off...perk of not grabbing on the go. It was a simple soup - not sure of the name, tasty. We also started with samosas. SOOOO delicious and the order is big. Great appetizer to start with if eating with friends. I get my noodle dishes with heat level: HOT. They are the perfect hotness but still enjoyable. Plenty of extra condiments on the table to make yours just right.Parking can be tricky. I usually avoid the weirdly set up parking lot and opt for street parking - no meter!
