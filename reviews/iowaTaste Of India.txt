We started off by ordering the chai tea.  This is a drink which I get nearly every coffee shop I go to. I can say without a doubt that this chai tea was absolutely incredible with just the right amount of spice... fine, I will say it. This was the best I've ever had.We started off with the paneer tikka.  I had never had that dish before but it will now be something I order every chance I get. To think that something as simple as sliced cottage cheese could have such an incredible taste... where have you been all my life?Now, onto the main course.  Of course, we had to get an order of naan. The naan had wonderful flavor without overpowering any of the other foods.  The butter chicken was mouthwatering and the chicken vindaloo provided a perfect spicy kick to the meal.This may have just become my go to place in Cedar Rapids for dinner. The only complaint I have is that I live 30 minutes from it or I would be eating here much much more."}, {"review_id": "SRDD4-knE0vDuRNu8rZoSA", "user_id": "DZxHZeqhEsdbZ6AjxxhCiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "BY FAR some of the BEST Indian food I have ever had! Very fresh, authentic, DELISH!Their lunch buffet is amazing! It's not old food, dried out, or boring. They have some of their menu favorites in the buffet. SO WORTH it!

The naan was ok but nothing special. The masala exceeded expectations! If you're actually used to spice order it medium/ hot - hot. They tone it down for the Midwest palate. But it was actually really good! Chicken wasn't overcooked and the sauce was thick and robust. I ordered takeout and they accommodated, even helping me pick what to order over the phone, even though it was at 1:57, right before they close for 3 hours. I picked it up 12 minutes later and it was ready to go. Easy and fast."}, {"review_id": "sQ6CLBkwEozRSngIlVVzeg", "user_id": "mnVm0aU2rZLP5ijZZBK2tA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Great big beautiful restaurant and amazing food!

As soon as I hit the door I was overwhelmed by the delicious smell. The food was delivered hot and just the right amount of spice. Speaking of, the spices are top quality and so flavorful. Would highly recommend pairing your meal with a mango drink (either one!). Try the naan too, perfect for dipping into chicken masala and palak paneer (and all the other amazing dishes I'm sure).

Last evening a party of four of us dined at Taste of India. We arrived about 6pm and were seated promptly. After spending a day working outside, the cool interior of the restaurant was refreshing, without being too frigid. The server, actually a team of three, took our drink orders and asked if we wanted any appetizers. The naan bread is always a favorite of ours, and it was simply delightful as always. It comes with two small dips, one sweet, and the other with just a bit of bite to it.I ordered the Chicken Korma, which by the way is a gluten free dish. Two others ordered the Shrimp Saag while our forth ordered a Shrimp with Rice entrée - I forget the name. The food was served in a very reasonable amount of time, and was served hot and spiced according to the request of the diner. I ordered mine medium, and the taste was fine, but not too spicy. Perhaps next time I will order it spicy just to sample the difference. Large chunks of white meat chicken were served in a brass bowl with a very creamy gravy. I can't say that I saw any sesame seeds or cocout as the menu stated, but perhaps in the mixture they were hard to see.The servers were very quick to offer refills on beverages and on the white rice that came with the meals. There were quite a large number of patrons arriving after we did, and with three servers the service did slow down somewhat. It took a little while to get 'to go' boxes, but nothing extreme. The checks arrived and again there was a slight delay in getting the bills settled.Overall I was very pleased with the food, and wonder why I don't dine there more often. Being from the west side of town, it is a little bit far. And since it is tucked away on Old Marion Rd, I guess we overlook it. The prices are very reasonable, the ambience is quiet and attractive, and the service was friendly if not prompt."}, {"review_id": "7n_Z3nHSc_utk8h7PnZDrQ", "user_id": "Ry2eEdDFbB3jCd-puLq0bg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2017", "text": "Very good food here, has a nice lunch buffet that has a good selection.

We loved the atmosphere of Taste of India - very authentic. Staff was pleasant and did not rush us. Offered us many suggestions! We ordered the samosas(delicious!!) for appetizers and the chicken Biryani medium, and chicken saag medium. Both were pretty good. The biryani was a little dry but had good flavor. The saag was a little too spinach-y for us but was very spicy! We asked for recommendations for my friend's almost one year old hoping for tofu or soft veggies, however no luck. Also wish we received more naan with the order. We will most likely be back - would love to try more breads and mango lassi!"}, {"review_id": "VKM4QMt7NMAlINClhuFAJw", "user_id": "ZwT9lp1WZYksyalVPOWn0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "Solid buffet.

If you new to Indian food butter chicken, or a mild chicken saag are great gateway foods. They also have other great options and a lot of vegetarian and vegan dishes. My favorite is Shahi Paneer medium to hot. The wait staff is not what you might expect of a wait staff but very friendly if you ask questions or need something. They also season the food appropriately, if you ask for the food hot they will give it to you hot. As long as you don't seem hesitant. My husband can eat hot hot wings with out batting an eye so can my son. I ordered my food medium so I could share and they were both crying. I however practically die eating a medium wing.Chia tea is great. Like most places I'd advise against the buffet.

We went for supper, and were able to get right in. Shortly after, a line grew in the waiting area. We had good timing! (Arrived around six)We decided to order some naan and several entrees to share between the four of us. The food was delicious and spices on point. One of our dishes was a chicken, and I would like for the meat to be cut up smaller. It was in huge chunks that were unappealing in such a small serving dish. It did take quite a while for the waiter to initially address us and take our drink and food order, but that was fine. Overall, wonderful experience, but plan on a two hour or so meal.
