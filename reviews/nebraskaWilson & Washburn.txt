I never even knew this cozy bar was here but boy am I glad I know now! Vegans rejoice! They have vegan apps, a vegan burger, a vegan lobster roll special (when I went at least), and a vegan dessert (spoiler alert: it's amazing). I ordered a dirty wicked cocktail that has cold brew coffee in it and it was tasty, but maybe a little strong for my taste because I'm a bit of an alcohol wimp. I got the vegan lobster roll special that satisfied my seafood salad-type craving, the taste was so spot on it was crazy! The chips are amazing too. Then I got the peach and mango crisp....sooo good. It's warm and comforting and so delicious. I can't wait to come back and try their VEGAN BRUNCH OPTION (I'm freaking out only a little I swear) on the weekend sometime! The atmosphere was fun and relaxed with some great music and friendly staff. Thank you so much for having such a variety of vegan options available when most places have none or an obligatory single option."}, {"review_id": "OME9G42AEym7GBy2Mrgg0w", "user_id": "R2WOBVaGgeT3eKBLNCHI-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "A great find in downtown Omaha. A couple friends and I went out last night for some late night food and stumbled upon Wilson and Washburn. I honestly had my expectations set a little low since we were going to a bar to eat, expecting stereotypically subpar, expensive food. But, I am so glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised!W&W is located right on Harney St. with ample street parking in front of the restaurant and around the area. Walking in, the inside was dim-lit with a very extensive bar and lots of seating. The atmosphere was very calming, casual, and almost felt classy. We were greeted by a friendly bartender who came to give us our menus and some water to start. We ended up ordering the Fish & Chips, House Salad, House Pulled Pork Sandwich. The house salad came first and was one of my favorite things. It was a really good salad. A mix of fresh assorted veggies, tomatoes, candied pecans and shavings of gruyere cheese all topped with some delicious, fragrant basil-arugula dressing. The Fish & Chips was cooked to perfection. It came piping hot, nice and crisp on the outside and tender and almost moist on the inside. Served with Ketchup, Tartar Sauce and Cole Slaw, it was definitely worth getting. The House Pulled Pork Sandwich was also good. The sandwich was topped with the house-made pulled pork and cole slaw. It was a little spicy, but the flavor was delicious. All in all, I am definitely coming back here. Not only was everything delicious, but nothing we ordered was over $10!"}, {"review_id": "D9ubI5ZbfK0ET69c6kiezA", "user_id": "QwbRmiOiNGQR23uvEkW_ww", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "What a cool back story for a restaurant. The artwork, the homage paid to the rebel women of Omaha, it's all very cool. Our service was great, the food only so-so. My short rib was a little dry, and not very flavorful. The meal itself was like ordering beef stroganoff with the noodles and short rib. I think the menu is a little misleading by not calling it short rib stroganoff. Also, there were barely any Brussels sprouts in my dish which was disappointing."}, {"review_id": "15sDLSNCPuaOjOQw8TFhEg", "user_id": "t2MBvqhOQV3ug8iUFfivCw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Cute little dive bar downtown.

Sacrifices must be made in the name of putting food in my belly!No, really it's actually colder in Houston (home) and San Antonio (where Mom, Dad and Sis live - shout out - \"love you, Dad!\") than it is here in Omaha. And ok. It was only a very comfortable, relaxed 6 minute walk but it was well worth it. The bartender said one of his favs is the Brisket Burger. So, Brisket Burger it was. What makes this a bit different is the combination of stuff piled on top: fried onions and awesome sauce (aka garlic mustard slaw). Oh - the house's smoked brisket is delicious. The homemade chips were really good too but a bit salty for my tastes. They've got 22 beers on tap, bottled beer, mixed drinks and wine. Great music too (imho)."}, {"review_id": "2p249rE7jOqlJRO41Zr3fw", "user_id": "06GpaxvQhOYmFTfWWwpBOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Pretty chill, fun place to hang out.  We came late on a saturday and was able to get a table.

East street parking. Still pretty busy, but could sit right away at 8pm which was a good sign. Ordered a house salad to start - this was the best part of meal. Great flavor and ultra fresh greens. Big portion, and I LOVE big salad. Only area for improvement is to pre toss dressing onto greens or serve on a larger plate; it was difficult to get dressing on every bite and not make a mess onto the table. Had the Beet burger, smokey peanut butter on the side. I'm not a huge smoke flavor fan so I'm glad I opted to get it on the side. However, I should have asked for a side of the salad dressing as that would have given it a little more flavor. Patty had a great crisp to outside and bun was a good texture. It could have used a dash of salt. Potato chips were good standard House made chips. Had I not indulged in Thai food for lunch, I would have tried an app as they all looked great but knew my eyes were larger than my stomach and held off. Service was nice and attentive. I'd recommend and come back."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/wilson-and-washburn-omaha-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
