You got me! Too bad you won't keep me.I went, of course, on a Monday evening for $1 tacos. I couldn't figure out whether to order first or just take a seat, so I asked. Well...they didn't understand me and I didn't understand them, which was cool. My thinking was I guess I am REALLY gonna get some authentic tacos!Then, two other families came in and get shown to a table. Now, I am pissed. On top of that, they get their orders in before me. I was there before any of them! Finally, I am shown to a dirty table. I sit and wait for it to be cleaned off and take my seat. During ordering, I get the bad news that the choriqueso and the cecina tacos are not for $1. Ok. So I order asada, al pastor and chorizo tacos. Two a piece.Finally, I get some chips and salsa. Chips are good. The salsa is warm, but very watery. The other salsas are in the bottle and you can get that from anywhere. Here comes the tacos (in a short time)! All are small (I finished them off), but filled to the rim. The al pastor is the star of the group. Nice and crispy but tender at the same time with plenty of flavor. The chorizo tacos had very little flavor and the asada tacos had none. The tortillas are good, but I am there for the meat!Keep your coat on if you go in the winter because the place is small and when that door opens you will freeze! Question: Y'all pay full price for these tiny tacos during the week??? I think on Mondays I will go back to Cheap Chicken for $5.99 @ that grocery store that starts w/ a \"J\"!"}, {"review_id": "3J4Oe5NphdqGdHjKAWORIA", "user_id": "fvSV2hRtaebYb0CHRvsvTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "The menudo was pretty good. Not the best but definitely good and a good portion. It looks like they also make fresh shakes there but I did not try them. If you like menudo, try it right there. Don't know about the rest of the food though. I will return for some more menudo and probably try out some other things.The service was not all that.

So my standards are pretty high when it comes to Mexican food. The first thing that makes it or breaks it for me is their salsas. Taqueria El Tio had pretty good and HOT salsas so I was instantly intrigued. Next the food, we mostly had tacos and a bean sope for my kids but everything we had was pretty tasty and the waitress was warm and friendly. The only thing that was a miss was the very sweet Jamaica water. As a Mexican, I know we like our stuff sweet, but drinking the Jamaica water without diluting it would've totally risen my AC1 levels so I hope they take note of that and do not go overload with the sugar. Other than that, it was an enjoyable dinner and had we been local Aurora residents, we would frequent again."}, {"review_id": "AbuNGvN7bsQ31XgXTBX5Fw", "user_id": "_qBn1dIGlHfmCzdSWsrLyQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "We came here a while back and I forgot to review but it popped up on Yelp and I figured I'd comment.

Luckily this showed up as the closest distance to me, so I decided to give it a try.Prior to reading any reviews, I pretty much went in here blindsided. Luckily I went in on a Monday and when asked if they had any specials for the day, they showed me a list of $1 tacos! Every taco is $1 besides the tongue and dry steak on Mondays. If they aren't $1, they're $1.69, I believe. Which isn't bad either.I bought 2 just to try, the al pastor and tripas with cilantro & onion. Soo yummy! They're a little on the smaller side compared to other tacos I've had, but you can't beat the price and the flavors. 2 was fulfilling for me, I probably could've had 3 :).I dined in, so I also received complimentary chips & salsa. Definitely going to come back and try other things. Service was quick & Staff is also friendly! Just a side note, they only accept plastic payment for $5 & over total."}, {"review_id": "vfsMlypvBQSgkr7yZtx0DA", "user_id": "1pzP58PeWictHQzctMU0nQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/9/2017", "text": "There are plenty of Mexican food in Aurora and this is just one more option.  The restaurant is located downtown and is actually pretty big and has lots of seating.  The food here was pretty good.  One of my favorite soups is the Caldo de Res (beef soup) and they offer it here on Wed. and Thur.  For $7, it comes with rice, tortillas and a side of fresh cilantro and onions.  The soup here is good.  The tortillas were gross for some reason.  Maybe it was a bad batch.For those chile rellenos (stuffed peppers) fans, they do not have them here.$1 Tacos on Monday$5 Margarita on FridayEasy street parking nearby.....| \\      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,      .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \\ -  ;  ;  ;  , _    ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .  (   ` - ` -  ' - '   '  - - - ' ' ( _ / . _ ) - ' ( _ \\ _ )"}, {"review_id": "aSRsaAm6fS5sSfxaqWuBQg", "user_id": "B9FpbRp4rgldjAw2BwLGcg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "Typical Mexican menu but done very well.Food is hot and plenty of food.Green and Red sauce in squeeze bottles.Complimentary chips and salsa.Bottled beer and excellent margaritas.The mango was particularly flavorful.Excellent friendly service.
