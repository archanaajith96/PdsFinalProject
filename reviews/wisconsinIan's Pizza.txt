One of my favorite places to grab dinner on campus. You can't go wrong with a slice of their famous mac n cheese pizza, although, there are many other delicious flavors to choose from as well. They don't label all the flavors in the restaurant, so instead of holding up the line asking what every single kind it (it will take forever to go through!) look online and plan ahead if you're a newcomer. Specialty slices are $4 a piece and regular (cheese, pepperoni and sausage) are $3. I am more than okay with the prices. They used to be $3 and $2 respectively but they decided to increase their workers pay to $10 an hour and they did that by increasing the slices price by $1. I'm more than okay with that idea and I applaud that they value they're workers but also let the community know of the change. It can get busy during the night on weekends but most times the line goes quick and it's an easy in and out. The salads are also very tasty and fresh. I frequently grab one on the side but I wouldn't go out of my way just to come for only getting a  salad."}, {"review_id": "z9l_26OPP4cucIuODtOlTQ", "user_id": "qwHkqtYghErrUVJIgMSyuw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "This place was interesting. The first time, I was one of the few people in there and ordered two slices (one of the famous mac-and-cheese and one of the pepperoni). Two slices is way more than one person needs but I didn't really know that at the time. Both were really good! The second time, it was incredibly busy and I ordered the same two slices, but they must've forgot my pizza in the oven or something because both slices were a little burned. Not enough to say I'd never go again, but it was kind of a bummer."}, {"review_id": "pEe0dPzOvOopdfclySq-oA", "user_id": "4VSaSL3ik7Pf_xgUyHG93w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Ian's is fun, they make all sorts of crazy pizzas. The mac and cheese pizza is a good one to eat after drinking a few beers on state street. When in Wisconsin right?My colleagues all enjoyed eating Ians frequently and I found myself gravitating towards their pepperoni pizza, which is delicious. I've also heard the salads are really good, I wanted to try one when I lived in Madison but it was to hard to resist the pizza temptations. :P"}, {"review_id": "hgZGP09NuvicMpbX17asEQ", "user_id": "4Sf5mucplXiJFofMMqfuYA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Ian's is my second favorite place in downtown Madison to get a giant piece of Mac & Cheese pizza. Which isn't saying much since there are only 2 places.However, they do have decent pizza and it's not totally overpriced. Just a bit. I will only order Ian's delivered, because going into the restaurant on State Street is a complete nightmare. I have done it at 2 am and and 3 pm and lots of times in between and it is always hot, crowded, and completely unorganized. They aren't very fast either.The Mac & Cheese pizza is good. Not the best, but it's good. I will say that the little bags of Puppy Chow are the only reason that I ever go here instead of the #1 giant slice of pizza place - Pizza di Roma.I've never had an excellent experience here and their delivery also takes FOREVER.But hey, it's convenient and it's good so if you're desperate for pizza and you can't walk a little ways down State for a REALLY good slice, go to Ian's."}, {"review_id": "2YDxWn9t78hdVFUJz0l55A", "user_id": "TMV18_Nn_medcn8lp-balA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Don't be put off by the travel worn interior or the college crowd! If you like pizza, TRY THIS PLACE!! The set up is unique in that you start at the salad end and tell the salad staff, across the glass, what you want from the multitudes of greens and toppings on display. Then, saunter down the line and tell the pizza staff which slice/slices you want from the MANY pizza varieties!! I never thought I'd say this, but, I LOVE THE MAC 'N CHEESE pizza!!! Man oh man, is this one tasty pie!!! And THIS is why I'm giving Ian's five stars...that mac 'n cheese number is AMAZEBALLS!!!"}, {"review_id": "UjEq0juyr6RYOOWRgoVYrQ", "user_id": "boLGreuzOXfreFivRIsbPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "Ian's Pizza is definitely one of the most tastiest local pizza restaurant with lots of amazing combinations. My to-go-favorite is the BBQ chicken pizza which I almost get every single time. The long line can be daunting but it definitely moves quickly and before you know it, you're biting into delicious pizza (or make your own salad). There's a hidden cooler underneath the cash register and Ian has IZZE's in stock here. The pizza is definitely better tasting when it's fresh and toasty, right out of the oven. So eat the pizza while it's still warm!"}, {"review_id": "jYLRkM7eO34-Qpx-_LxfSg", "user_id": "VSxZIENjIaM4dH3mk7CM4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I always try something different each time I stop in.

We went one night, and the next night when discussing dinner options, we decided we had to go again. YES, that good.The salads are truly where its at. Ian's Pizza had a special salad curated for the CrossFit Games that had the best dressing on it. The soba noodles were a nice surprise as well, and the feta cheese was some of the best I've ever tasted.Gluten Free crust was a hit. The only miss on the pizzas was the chicken (which we added every time). It had a little bit too much buffalo sauce on it for me and was just a little too spicy. I'd watch the seasoning on the chicken, or if you're really torn and don't like spicy things, don't add it! Atmosphere was crazy both nights we went, but the staff was organized, calm, and handled the crowds no problem."}, {"review_id": "Llj4OWuzVgdFVZn1gsulvw", "user_id": "DGQEY6I7zNc85D51Nqp2uQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "The infamous Ian's Pizza of downtown Madison.

Yes. But is it really tasty? Also yes.Ian's is the go-to late night pizza place in Madison and always has a line out the door starting around midnight. Their signature is mac and cheese pizza and WOW, is that good. Another bonus? They have homemade ranch. And that's also pretty GD good.They do offer rotating specials that they advertise on the sandwich board outside. That's cool!

I've lived in Madison for 3 years now & haven't come close to finding it. I've heard a lot about Ian's from many different people, & my husband finally took me to Ian's on Friday. We ordered a large pie w red sauce, fresh mozzarella & fresh basil. The girl taking our order said \"like vegan?\" and we said \"no like a plain cheese pie w fresh basil\" then she said \"fresh basil? uh..we have a spice rack?\" So we just looked at eachother and said \"one large cheese pie.\" What we got, 20mins later, was a pie covered in red sauce with an unmelted ball of cheese on the middle of each slice. I'm still in awe. So many people let this happen...no one stopped and said \"hey? maybe this isn't right?\" that I truly can't believe it. So not only were the employees clueless and rude but they couldn't even make a plain cheese pizza.
