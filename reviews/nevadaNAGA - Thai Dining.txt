It's both contemporary and intimate. Intimate not only in terms of the dimly lit ambiance, but also that you might accidentally overhear your neighboring table's conversation. Kinda like a double-date, I guess? The more the merrier...We stopped in for dinner, but as other reviewers have stated, service was pretty slow. It took awhile for waters to come out and we didn't have silverware/napkins until much later. These were a couple setbacks, but the food makes up for it. First of all, the chicken in my pad see ew was delicious -- it was barbecued so it was different than what other Thai places serve. They use regular broccoli instead of the traditional Chinese broccoli, but I'm guessing it's to better complement the crinkle cut carrots they have added. My bf got his usual chicken yellow curry, which he said he enjoyed. The rice was served in a heart-shape, but it was far too little for the amount of curry. Come on now! We had to order a second one. On a spicy scale of 0 to 4, we both opted for 1 in our respective dishes. It had just the right amount of flavor and kick."}, {"review_id": "vvXPOa1yfno-uAnkMZoJtQ", "user_id": "cp_7hB4ITPnlIJJznn_QSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "So glad I stumbled upon this place!

When you walk in it's a small restaurant with one dining area. The service was friendly and the food was delicious. We ordered the Pad Thai lunch special and Tom Yum soup. The lunch special includes rice, a salad, and soup. The soup came with crackers and a dipping sauce. The food can be made to order with a spiciness level 1-4. I had 2.5 and it was perfect. 4 stars because it was a little slow at lunch."}, {"review_id": "qWKx1e7bsX2GZnQUvGtPGg", "user_id": "5HqZ2NYwDivAchQa_HY9nQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "A small, cute Thai place in Henderson. The place seems brand new, I'm not sure how long it has been there, but by brand new I mean extra clean! They bring you wonton chips and sauces so you can see the different heat levels before ordering. The prices are decent and the food is good! I had the pad Thai with shrimp, although I wish I had gotten it without the peanut sauce because it was over powering and made it a little one note (just my personal preference though!) other than that, just yummy food.

Yelp is my go to and a HUGE Thank You to my fellow Yelpers for posting reviews. I sometimes forget ... well a lot of times I fail to check in and post reviews but I have been trying to do a better job lately since I rely heavily reviews in my travels.I love Naga Thai for a few reasons: great service, very nice ambiance, and excellent food. I ordered Pad Thai a little spicy off the lunch menu which was served with a little cup of yummy soup and a salad w/ginger dressing. What a perfectly portioned meal. The flavor and heat were a perfect blend of sweet, spicy and sour! I had work to do and decided to order dinner to go since I was packing a cooler. Ordered the pineapple fried rice with chicken and pineapple chicken curry!  Both were full of flavor, fresh ingredients, and all ingredients perfectly balanced.

It looks and feels very clean. The service was quick and friendly. We were immediately greeted and sat. I ordered the Naga Salad with Tofu. The dish was just OK. The portion seemed small and there wasn't much flavor to it. The fried tofu blocks were also harder than it should have been. I'm giving it 4 stars because my boyfriend's dish was great. I think they do Thai food well. I wouldn't recommend ordering the Naga Salad. I bet the papaya Salad would have been a better choice at a Thai restaurant.

The first issue here is that they are S L O W. It took over 10 minutes to get water and an additional 10 minutes to order. Dinner was another 30 minutes later and we were not checked on until nearly done. This is noteworthy since my mom did not like her food, could not inform the server, and was instead stuck eating something she didn't care for.As for my meal, something was also very off. I ordered the Laab prepared with tofu at a spice level of 10. The spice was not hot, but was seriously irritating my sinuses and had a bitter/charred taste. I inquired with the server about the type of chilis used, and why I did not see any Thai bird chilis. She told me they use Mexican-yes, you heard correctly-chili powder. WTF is Mexican chili powder doing in my Laab? That explains the bitter, off taste. Anyway, upon further inquiry, I was informed that they do not have Thai bird chilis in the restaurant AT ALL! Thus, this is not really a Thai restaurant in the slightest. If you don't mind Mexican-Thai fusion, this is your place. If you're thinking WTF just like I was, I suggest a different, more authentic location."}, {"review_id": "wfsOsfRYxmjjSEXo6Bc6yQ", "user_id": "GmKdtKBqshtKygjcICRrKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "My husband and I come here frequently because it is so delicious!

Luckily for me it's in my neighborhood. Dining in here is best because the atmosphere is intimate and romantic. Their dishes are so delicious! I highly recommend their thai tea, Panang curry, Tom Kah, Pad see eiu and lychee boba. On a bad day, they are busy. Needless to say this does not ever change the quality of the food.

After a short wait to be seated, it was five minutes before they visited our table to bring some fried crisps and four various dipping sauces. I then requested menu's, and our waitress later returned with our menus and drinks. After that we waited for 15 minutes before she returned to take our menu. She and the other staff were hustling, and even on a Thursday night people kept showing up to the almost packed, small restaurant. Food began arriving after 22 minutes. The food was good, but I feel was overpriced. Hotness was on a scale from 1-4, and 4 was hot but not nearly as hot as I would have liked. Try the Rama Noodle if you like noodles and peanut sauce.We were done and waiting for the bill for quite sometime during which I wrote this. Honestly, I probably won't be back.
