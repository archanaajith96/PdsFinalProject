Every single thing we ordered was incredible--our cocktails, the buffalo mozzarella appetizer, our salads, and the pizza with caramelized onions--all of them were delicious. The service was excellent, the food came out quickly, and the decor was beautiful. Thank you so much for making our anniversary one to remember!"}, {"review_id": "oDcmmApuwMDw6i6c4TMuSg", "user_id": "QKHm5bsOcd8Dl7f_8vOzug", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "I'd actually give this place a 3.5 stars if I could. Overall, our experience was good...but I've had better. The ambiance and decor had a cool urban hipster vibe to it. Very casual and cozy which created a relaxed dining atmosphere. Our server was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Luckily, service was pretty good, otherwise I would have given it a lower score. Now onto the food...overall the food was flavorful and fresh. You can tell that they use quality ingredients. To start, we ordered the Rocket (Arugula) Salad which was one of the highlights of our meal. It was not overly dressed so you can still taste the freshness of the ingredients. We also ordered their meatballs (one of their specials that night) and they were light, airy, and perfectly balanced. Another highlight of our meal. After the first two dishes the rest of the meal slowly slipped into mediocrity.....Next came their Fior di Latte  (house-made mozzarella). The flavor was creamy and the fruity olive oil complimented the richness of the cheese. Although the flavor was good, you can tell that the cheese was over-worked.  I know that Fior di Latte is supposed to have a springy texture, but this cheese was almost too chewy and rubbery. Then came our pizzas. Again, the ingredients were fresh and the flavors were spot on, however, the crust was just too doughy. On the outside the crust looked okay, but the bottom looked under-cooked. We didn't send the pizzas back because we felt bad, it was a busy Friday night. It's such a shame that this pizzeria's appetizers tasted better than their pizzas. For what we paid (based on food alone) I'm not sure if it was worth it."}, {"review_id": "EAE8r3gDvGT8i0t_j4j77Q", "user_id": "0Pd-LScDP0zLf4ShnV8L0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "My husband and I always battle on our pizza preferences. I like thin crust and he prefers thick crust. I won that night in Burlington and Pizzeria Verita we went. For a weekend night, all the tables were full but we were able to score a couple seats at the bar. The drinks menu offered a good selection of inventive cocktails, 8 different negronis and local beers on tap.The Caesar salad was huge and very good. The only complaint we have is that we asked for no anchovies and of course it was served with anchovies. It was sent back and with things like this, you know all they did was take off the anchovies and send it straight back. Not a huge deal because we have an aversion instead of an allergy.For pizzas, we had the Diavola (spicy soppressata, provolone, tomato basil) and Funghi Rustico (wild mushroom, parm, sage, truffle oil). I thought the thickness of the dough was perfect. Thin but not so much that everything falls apart. The toppings were also quite delicious."}, {"review_id": "o0FKwxLtFOLMtS2OZHbYpA", "user_id": "wquzF6UKoxyl0V7cyp13rA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I'm widdit.

Unfortunately Vermont lacks a lot of authentic Italian or other diverse restaurants. If you hop over to another state you will be able to find quality Italian food and at a semi-reasonable price. I'm willing to pay for authenticity but this place seems a little overdone. Food was pretty good, and the espresso was delicious. I'd recommend this as a great yearly date night, but not a regular spot."}, {"review_id": "Wy59453aJm02FDl4Q7QYYA", "user_id": "TPV2JHBKUheQNoAQRqlrJw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "We really liked this place! The pizza was solid, and the decor and ambiance were good as well. The only thing is that the pizza was definitely skimping on the more expensive ingredients like the fior di latte, with large areas of sauce and crust with no cheese. We also noticed that many of the pizzas are vegetarian (which is great for me!) with the option to pay extra for meat. My boyfriend wasn't thrilled to have to pay extra for prosciutto on a pizza that traditionally has it (the diavolo style.)"}, {"review_id": "k9HnA4HEJDiN6qh7VWA7uA", "user_id": "kt5pm4jcjigV7n2vGyEDMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/24/2017", "text": "Very similar to American flatbread in terms of setting, I think slightly more intimate if you are looking for a 1 on 1 location. The maize pizza is the highlight without a doubt - maybe my favorite pizza overall. The corn and prosciutto ham combo of sweet and savory is so simple and so well done.

We ordered the Mais which had just the right balance of sweet and savory. The sweet corn and salty speck worked really well together. We also ordered the Salsiccia E Funghi with hot housemade Vermont sausage and it was extremely tasty. It was loaded with sausage, so definitely a great option of the meat lovers.

I've always wanted to try this place. The ambiance is wonderful and the place inside is dark, though cozy. You can sit at the bar and watch the pizza makers, but we had a table for 3 in the center. We sampled some of the great beer selections on tap. The service could have been better, our waitress could have been more attentive and taken our food order earlier. We had an arugula, gorgonzola and pear salad which was wonderful. An offering of fresh grated pepper would have made it amazing, but it was still very good. I saved some of it to top our pizza.We ordered the cinque formaggi and the fennel sausage and broccoli rabe pizzas. The sausage pizza was excellent and you could taste the farm-fresh ingredients. The 5-cheese pizza was underdone and soggy. We told our waitress and they re-made the pizza. It was better the second time, but in general they should be making the pizza thinner and cooking it longer. We come from the \"pizza belt\" in Connecticut, so we like it thin and crispy! Otherwise, this place was excellent and we would return."}, {"review_id": "t23XBoyWqIxJjSJnWp5w3A", "user_id": "GcnlGJXQQmNYG4CuNsLy5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2017", "text": "Living in Burlington, I have dined all over Burlington's restaurants.Restaurants line up and down the downtown area making decision time difficult. Small but quaint, Pizzeria Verita  has been one of my favorite restaurants to come back to time after time. They offer top-notch wood-fired Neapolitan pizza and other Italian classics. The service is impeccable, with a knowledgeable and friendly staff. The vibe is trendy, and is nestled in the heart of downtown Burlington, minutes from the Waterfront!  Inside is a perfect open view of the kitchen, featuring a brick oven for pizza.
