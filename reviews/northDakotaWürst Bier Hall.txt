Sounds strange, but it was kind of the sweet and savory. The sweet reminds me of a cinnamon roll. My only complaint  would be that staff needs to be better educated aboutt the breweries. If you are going to sell crafts you have to know where they are from....its part of the charm.

I can't think of anything I didn't like about lunch here. The pretzels were fresh and oh-so soft. I think my fiance still has dreams about them. The decor was super cool and casual. We ate at canteen style benches and tables and educated ourselves about their beers and beer-making process, which was conveniently scrawled in chalk on the walls. Their logo is also super awesome-- who else has a jackalope? My fiance even bought a shirt. Rick had a really great sausage sandwich. My meal of borscht and spatzle with gravy, mushrooms and tangy sauerkraut was just perfect. My pear beer came out cold in a frosted mug. We were just passing through. I wish Wurst was in Nebraska!

We sat in front, which has the most light. The crowd was happy and engaged, but that noise was OK as the volume of the background music had a tendency to overwhelm. The service was very good and the beer selection was impressive. I chose a Drekker, which as a tap room just a few doors down, while Gayle chose another local beer. The sausage selection was impressive, and really tasty according to Gayle. I had a salad wedge and chicken, which wasn't quite what I expected, even though it was tasty and about what I wanted food and light bites wise.

Fargo's got a lot of great spots, don't misinterpret what I'm sayin', but a lot of the joints are chains which originated elsewhere. To the best of my knowledge, Würst Bier Hall is unique to Fargo. If I'm wrong, hit me up. I'll admit it! Würst Bier Hall is one of the best places to drop in anytime you are compelled to park downtown. It's off Broadway, and it's a short walk to all kinds of convenient parking. Nothin' wrong with a couple blocks of cardio to get the pump spinnin'! Now, if you're draggin' around a Würstchen or two or... hey... whatever your accountant allows, the bouncer don't boot you out until 7 pm. So, mom and dad, don't sweat it. This watering hole has a killer menu, but probably not a lot for the juvenile palate, so your mileage is gonna vary. Since I'm discussin' the menu, it's worth a perusal. Stop in and check the predictably Deutsche digs. Fargo's gonna do it well cuz they got a big contingent of Germans in these parts. I'm gonna drop a recommend for the rabbit w/rattlesnake & jalapeno (smoked). That's right. I find myself traveling a lot and I like the weird stuff. I thought I might slide my predator/prey relationship up to the scale and check the balance. I ain't exactly a bratwurst guy, and I thought this was a fantastic offering. But, you ain't goin' wrong with anything on the menu. You can tell a good place if the menu ain't too big. This is a menu that looks like a kitchen might actually know how to make something and not have to rely on freezers and microwaves. They serve up knoephla and borscht, both of which are very tasty. As the dreamer I am and if Würst Bier Hall wanted to throw a bone to the ol' dog, here, I would ask for the each of these soups to be served with their respective meat pastries. C'mon! You got knoephla, you gotta have fleischkuechle. You got borscht, you gotta have chebureki, right? Ahhh... I can't bust their chops too bad. They do have pierogi on the menu, which does the job.  But, seriously... fleischkuechle. It's hard to find the good stuff in town, my friends!I've been here a few times and I have always been served a good meal. It'll take a little stab at the ol' bursa, but sometimes you gotta drop some senator sandpaper to make life a little smoother, right? Well, let me tell you straight... set aside a few Deutschmarks so you can thank the wonderful wait staff for taking care of you the way Mutti used to. These young men and women have to put up with your terrible German accent. Why be a Hohlkopf when you can be a wohlwollender Fremder? Take care of your people and they take care of you.

This place is absolutely amazing. It has a German flair with twists of multiple unique influences on their dishes. It was the perfect place to head after traveling, with very hungry tummies! Lets just say, when in Fargo, Wurst is a must! First, their beer selection is FANTASTIC! I ordered an apricot wheat beer that was phenomenal and had just a hint of apricot, not too sweet! High five! For food, we ordered the Pierogis to start and they were covered in a sriracha butter sauce with a hint of curry and sour cream on the side. They were like pillows of mashed potato goodness. For my meal, I ordered the bratwurst bahn mi style with a side of spaetzle mac {yes, I was being a fatty but couldn't resist!!!}. Um, ok, you have to do this whole bahn mi style thing. It is a delicious bratwurst {or sausage of your choice}, tucked into a homemade roll, and topped with sriracha mayo, pickled carrots, jalapeno, cucumber, cilantro, and soy sauce. The mac, no words, it was perfection and better than any other mac that i've had. To end, we split the homemade kuchen - i'm not a dessert person and this is a must. All that I can say is, I am happy they're not in AZ because I would probably be eating here daily. IT IS SO YUM! If you're in the area, get there now.
