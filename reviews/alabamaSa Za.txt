Shrimp lobster pasta (picture posted) was bland and watered down-- had to drown it in salt and pepper to be able to get a couple bites from it. The plate was one of the most expensive pasta dishes but It tasted like minute-made pasta.Spinach and artichoke dip was not as bad but not amazing.The garlic bread was okay, but I wasn't expecting much as it's $3 + add on fees; however, as stated, the pasta didn't match its upper price range."}, {"review_id": "VecgZ8RSzNAj7w-3ZZRbiA", "user_id": "elxnrpdTISvMoWP-kO9Mhg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "I have never experienced such horrible customer service like I did here. The wings I ordered only came with 6 when it stated 8 wings. I simply ignored complaining, because it was only an appetizer. After waiting 40 minutes for a to-go pasta I asked the bartender for an update and he stated it's coming right out. He disappeared for 20 minutes, other customer approached the bar outside and ordered as well. One couple ordered wings to-go and pizza and got there order. I asked if they ordered ahead and they said no. Once the couple walked away my food finally came. As I was about to check my food, a black elder man to my right of the bar asked for a to-go box ( he did ask three times, but I think he thought the guy was ignoring him. He never acknowledged him his entire sit) the bartender in a snappy attitude said, \" I heard you. I am not death!\" I paid for my food and just threw it away. This place is a disaster. Alabama needs work. It's 2018 things literally have to change."}, {"review_id": "Vn55VkTdEUuKS7o9-WE7hA", "user_id": "7k2eMBDkhUHS6kk7k0K0rQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "When we walked up to the restaurant the smell of fresh baked Italian foods filled the air.  Kinda reminded me of the cartoon where the smell picked the character up and floated them to the source.   Lol.  Downtown Montgomery Italian restaurant in an older shop by Riverwalk that's been beautifully renovated.   Tall ceilings, huge wooden beams, warm colors and neat lighting.  The atmosphere is very inviting and relaxed.  Dress casual.  We asked the waitress her favorite- quickly she said meatball pizza.  So we went with her suggestion.  Hands down best choice ever!  The crust was thin (not cracker thin but nice) crispy, layered with cheese, the sauce and meatballs were layered on top.  The sauce was full of flavor, not too acidic.  The meatballs were crumbled on top and had good texture and flavor.  We also ordered garlic bread. It was like a flattened loaf with cheese, butter and fresh garlic on top of the loaf.  Very good!  This is a place I'd defiantly visit often if I lived in Montgomery!!"}, {"review_id": "KOj4Bb5jJCYKGuqECefULQ", "user_id": "da8ifn1R5pYQND2laioN1g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "We stopped in for a client dinner last night. Food was good, but the serer was a joke. He was terrible. Not friendly or personable, didn't check up on us, food took forever to get out, although it was waiting under the hot lamps forever. He couldn't remember who's food went where. I think he knew he was getting his 20% gratuity which was automatically put on the check and didn't care.

Walked in as a group of 5 for a quick dinner. Walked in and were seated by 6:40. We got attention 15 minutes later. Waited 15 minutes for the drinks.We timed this and the food arrived 54 min later. The dishes didn't all come at the same time. My short ribs were missing the famous cab filled poached egg. I asked to speak with the manager and her response was that they are behind on all their orders.Sorry, If you are busy every evening, you should be able to make enough to hire more employees to provide the best service to all customers. We never got an update regarding the delay in making the food.With regards to the food ordered this evening. The short rib was good just make sure the poached egg is on top!!! My colleague said the pork shop was good. Others had the stuffed peppers, spaghetti and meatballs and a salad. They comped a round of drinks and 10% off the order.The food was what got the stars here but the service, absolutely horrible. If you don't mind waiting, please come here and you will enjoy the food. Otherwise, good luck!"}, {"review_id": "BnT605x-N7RQtjaApcGVJA", "user_id": "msIRe0ESQI4AeJdcJQhcCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "Made a reservation for 1 on Open Table. The place is located in heart of downtown. Less than a block away from my hotel. Brandi was my waitress and she was amazing. She knew the menu, she was polite and always smiled. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce is not as thick as I am used to but still good. It comes with two medium size meatballs. It is definitely a plate that will fill you up. Their dessert of the day was Salted Carmel Cheescake and well I had to say YES. Nice portino. Too much for one person honestly and super rich.

I'm very picky when it comes to my pizza, because I love it, it's my favorite food so I'll be quite honest about it. I ordered the wild mushroom pizza, and it came out luke warm with soupy topping textures, and actually tasted like french onion soup?...which doesn't really mean anything but just an observation. Plus, so dark in there at night. I'll never get the eating in the dark thing at restaurants smh. The crust/dough of the pizza was actually quite good though. My parents and I were just visiting Montgomery up from the Washington D.C area, which is an incredibly vibrant and diverse area for top notch restaurants, so just a little background on where I'm coming from."}, {"review_id": "rdlvm8iTF3NPNVSvr0Ef-w", "user_id": "2mONm_M3pLKpEzMbOVqV-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "I had the shrimp pasta look like I had to pay extra for the shrimp maybe should have gotten the chicken lol but overall it was good couldn't eat it all"}, {"review_id": "mbRFDY0x_-3TfZXwyzmPdQ", "user_id": "YmwPYw_rHXEAftomb5o5yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "This place was great. We needed a place for dinner to eat after we arrived in Montgomery after the 10-hour drive. This was an excellent choice and was recommended by one of the valets. I had a flash fried grouper that was on the special with garlic Parmesan risotto and asparagus that was Top Notch the asparagus was quite crisp. My daughter enjoyed her Pizza tremendously and my son enjoyed his spaghetti. My father had salmon and my mom had muscles that they both enjoyed tremendously. My wife and mom had a meatball dish with sausage and penne pasta. That they enjoyed. The portions for them were super huge and they probably should have split the dish.

Great things: Caleb our server, was excellent! Attentive, pleasant, friendly and was great to deal with. They give military discounts!The food was delicious, quick, fresh and well priced for the portion size given. It was impressive to see such good food in such a large portion!!We were in and out of there in an hour. Surprisingly we didn't feel rushed. I was able to make reservations online through the owner. Sad to have missed him this evening. Disappointing things: we were seated by the door, which kept opening, and it was very cold outside. We asked if there was somewhere else we could sit, but sadly no other warmer tables. So they turned off the fan and we all kept our jackets on. There was a larger table waiting to be seated and our 4 top was part of it. Sadly they kept eying our table like \"when are you leaving so we can sit down?!\" It wasn't pleasant. And a busser even walked over to that table and eyed our table as well. ....we were not, however, rushed out of the restaurant. Would we go back. Most definitely. And tell our friends about it, too.Update 12/30/17: My husband and i decided we wanted to celebrate our anniversary here tonight since the food was delicious the last time. I contacted the restaurant via open table and reserved one for us. We went with some friends to enjoy!We were sat away from the front door, which was wonderful because it was quite chilly. Our server Haley was very attentive and many times wished us a happy anniversary. We had an excellent scallop and shrimp appetizer! Some of the best scallops we have ever had. My husband ordered the veal parm, and he said it was excellent. When they handed me my meal, it wasn't what i ordered. So as my husband and our friends enjoyed their meal and almost finished, the correct entree that i ordered was delivered. Thankfully we weren't in a rush to leave. The meal i had was excellent and thankful they could fix it up. Just sad i ate somewhat by myself at that point. Haley told us we would be getter free dessert so we all ordered something. The cannolis were excellent. Haven't had any that good since traveling home to upstate NY. I'm not changing the stars, they still deserve them for the quality of food. But very disappointed that my meal was messed up."}, {"review_id": "TP__lE7bPlIDbG8wxMun-A", "user_id": "D68QNT_x1pSOmF__jgx5og", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/10/2017", "text": "It was an okay meal.

Co worker and I ordered spinach artichoke dip that was again, just okay. She had the chicken piccata and I had the 8 oz filet special (see pic).

We have been here at least once a year, which may not seem like a lot, except that we have lived in Atlanta and North of Seattle during that time...it takes real effort to get to Montgomery!Anyway, I have told folks that this is my favorite pizza in the WORLD for years. Last year, when we came, the pizza crust was a little chewy, instead of the thin, crispy airy crust we had been experiencing. I chalked it up to a bad batch, or bad prep. Toppings still excellent.However, when we are there last night, the crust was unforgivably dense and chewy. Hubby used to work in a pizza place many moons ago and says it tasted like it had too much flour in it. Anyway, it was bad enough to detract from the excellent toppings.We also noticed that a Mellow Mushroom has opened a stone's throw away... these guys need to step up their game if they are going to maintain a following.  Cheers!"}, {"review_id": "0jB1LwxOwXPOKd45Dh7s8g", "user_id": "8O9Ug8E3chUl4p-suNZ0gg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "AMAZING food!
