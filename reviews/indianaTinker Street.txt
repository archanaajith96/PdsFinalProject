Some family came down so we wanted to find a true Tapas place in Indianapolis. I was glad we were able to come to the conclusion that this was our best option.The wine and wine stewards truly knew how to be so descriptive on a bottle of wine, and found the perfect pairing for our late night adventure. I wasn't the biggest fan of how small the place is, I do think they should open it up more or relocate so it's truly not \"shoulder to shoulder\", it was a bit awkward as most patrons could hear our conversation and we could hear theres as their wasn't really enough music playing to drown out the sound.I don't think they deserve anything under 5 stars, as it was excellent service and a wonderful taste of true Italian wine. Their selection of Dry Reds was fantastic!"}, {"review_id": "zHsrqMNy_9plOxBNtvcH4Q", "user_id": "TvcvSou_ATV1wxcAjMmE6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Great first experience at Tinker Street! I met a friend here on a Friday night. We had to wait 30 minutes to be seated but we didn't mind. They have a nice long table which is the \"waiting area.\" Grab a drink and catch up! Get there early because I guarantee there will be a wait. The space is small and intimate but you don't feel like you're on top of one another. The service was exceptional. The food was amazing (pictures posted of what we ordered). If you're unsure what to get, I recommend the shrimp and grits. Save room for dessert!

They're most recent menu is amazing. I don't know if you can go wrong with any of the menu options. They also clearly mark everything letting you know what contains dairy, is vegan and gluten free (which is awesome!). They have wine and beer only but have a good list and pretty decent prices. They also started us out with a small sample of sparkling wine when we were seated which was a nice touch. We tried the tuna and beef tartare from the small plate part of the menu and both were packed with flavor! Came with a side of chips you could use for dipping. Awesome little appetizer. For the entree I tried the pork belly with the forbidden rice, kimchi & fried duck egg and oh. my. gosh. This was truly one of the best meals I've ever had! Each bite was sweet, spicy, savory and salty all at once. I can't say enough how delicious this combination is. As much as i love trying new things- when i go back i will reorder this again. It was that good!We ended with the S'more pot de creme- with homemade marshmallow fluff. Also delicious! It was a great way to end a delicious meal. Overall, everything was incredible- service, quality, cost, etc!

We have been to restaurants with price tags three times what we paid and have not experienced this service quality! Everyone was kind, knowledgeable, hard working, and attentive. Our dirty plates were promptly replaced with clean ones and our water glasses were never empty. We opted for 4 dishes to split (more of a tapas feel). Our waiter had wonderful suggestions about ordering the courses so that each of them could shine.The complementary prosecco was awesome. We shared the seasonal sweet corn (cold!) soup. Then we shared the squash noodle pad thai (also cold!). Then came the corn/mushroom/cream bruschetta, followed by a huge helping of their fries with yummy lemon-garlic dipping sauce. Overall, this was just the right amount of food for us. We loved trying so many dishes...they use very unique ingredients, but each dish is very well constructed and delicious. They make you think, and we felt like we were on an adventure!Only critique was the noise level...fairly noisy and somewhat difficult to carry on a conversation.

This is truly an amazing establishment. I went here last night with my mom and a few friends and we had such a wonderful evening.Their wine list is extensive with great options! They have my favorite Chardonnay and it is always delicious. We started out by ordering the fresh cut fries for the table. They were perfectly crisp and came with 2 dipping sauces. I could have eaten an entire bag of these to myself!For dinner, I started with the heirloom tomato salad. This salad was so fresh and a perfect summer salad. It was topped with fried pickles, cucumbers and a light blue cheese dressing. So tasty! I then ordered the pork tenderloin with succotash. It was so great! The pork was cooked perfectly and the succotash had great flavor.All in all- Tinker Street is a must! The food is always fresh and delicious.

Double Check! And both incredibly savory and unique dishes? You better believe! Tinker Street is a Great place to take a date or just have an intimate evening with friends. It can get crowded, so I recommend not coming with a large group (its a small building) and be ready for a little wait. BUT...the wait is definitely worth it. For apps we went with the infamous Fried Brussels Sprouts. I have to say, though I am a big fan of their spicy and acidity Dijon vinaigrette and the wonderfully crisp texture of the sprouts,  it was overly greasy for me. I personally would sacrifice this extra crispiness for a roasted version with all the remaining flavors and components. For mains, it was the rainbow trout and their famous pork belly! The fish was cooked perfectly, and the delicate vegetables and sauce paired with it made for a light and refreshing experience. The pork belly on the other hand, was a whole other Beast...Here's how it is listed on the menu \"Pork belly, forbidden rice, red cabbage kimchi, tamari glaze, and duck egg\".....This is pure Epicness! The description does the dish justice as it is a mouth and gut check. I recommend splitting this with someone as it is fairly rich. And though we were against desserts....one quick look at the description of the \"Apple Dutch Baby\" (Salted Caramel, Sorghum Whipped Cream, Thyme) and we knew we could go for another round. Great Dessert! The thyme especially paired incredibly well with the bakes apples and salted caramel. Overall, Tinker Street is a must. If you live or work around the downtown area, definitely treat yourself and check it out."}, {"review_id": "fOixQpGPnHUUC--OjfgBhw", "user_id": "jWYBlI_RtuVjU6jbDq5fyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Ever since the recent kerfuffel that caused this restaurant to close for less than two weeks, we were more than eager to show up for the grand re-opening under the revamped ownership of Tom Main and Chef Braedon Kellner. The days open are different. The restaurant is now closed on Sunday and Monday nights. The menu is different, at least in presentation. Instead of three categories and dessert, it is now two categories, \"Beginnings\" and \"Larger Plates,\" and dessert. The food, I am very happy to report, is as superlative as ever. My spouse and I decided to share three dishes and dessert. We first shared the shrimp and squid dish, a beginning. It was shrimp and squid skewered on a piece of sugar cane with a lime aioli. This was a delicious dish with just a little bit of heat. It was an ideal starter - not too much, yet leading us into our next dish. Not surprisingly, the shrimp and the squid were both perfectly cooked. And there were charred spring onions to add to the flavor profile. Next we shared the bucatini dish, a \"Larger Dish,\" which was sauced with a ramp pesto, pine nuts and green peas. It was refreshing, not oversauced and very Italian. It was my favorite of the dishes we sampled. Finally, we moved to sharing the Alaskan halibut (since it is now in season). It was accompanied by what was described as a \"fricasee of artichokes,\" ramps, beets, cucumbers, Champagne and curry oil. While there might have been a fear of overpowering the halibut with the accompaniments, it did not happen. The flavors blended beautifully and the fish, of course, was perfectly prepared. We paired these three courses with a Maynard Chateauneuf du Pape Blanc after consulting with Kyle, the resident som.  The wine was both subtle and smooth and handled the various flavors extremely well. Kyle was a little worried about how it would work with the layers of flavor with the halibut. It was just fine. Finally, we opted to share a Berry Parfait to end the meal. The description promised a \"Bavarian Cream\" with strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. Since my spouse knows what it takes to make a Bavarian Cream, we were eager to give it a go. And it was a perfect ending. We were glad to have Brett as our server. He is competent without being overbearing. We are so happy to report that Tinker Street and Chef Braedon Kellner have not lost a beat! The food was outstanding and Tinker Street` will remain in our regular rotation."}, {"review_id": "0i0aYhdqXDA7LyeuDipHaQ", "user_id": "jRiy7sOkSQA_0SqjCNmJQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "Our third visit to Tinker Street in as many years has cemented it as my favorite restaurant in Indy.

Definitely seems like an up-and-coming place. Frankly, the restaurant has outgrown its space a bit - we had to wait for an hour (table of 3) and sat crammed in the entrance with glasses of wine. They don't take reservations for groups less than 5. It wasn't the end of the world, but the tight space and loud ambiance wasn't ideal.Food: We started with the Brussels sprouts, which two of us found too \"burnt\" tasting. I understand that reduced balsamic can have that effect, but it was a bit much for my palette. My crab cakes were phenomenal (I opted for two for my dinner entree). The sauce was bright and citrusy. I'd highly recommend them! My husband's beef tips were overdone, but he didn't want to send them back (they're cooked in a stew, so the entire batch may have been well-done). He commented positively on the hash brown-like side dish though. Lastly, my friend ordered the ramen which was hearty and filling (but too salty). Finished with the s'mores pot de creme - absolutely delicious! Rich and decadent with a hint of ash.(Note: the people next to us both sent dishes back and left. The next couple who sat down raved about their meals. Seems like the food is hit or miss)Service: impeccable.
