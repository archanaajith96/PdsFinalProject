Place was full! Why only 4 stars? Well, wife had the Cajun salad which was good & I had the 5 egg (forgettable) omelette. The quinoa bean hash brown hash cake with it was probably cooked in sea water! It was that bad. If you have high BP or have heart failure, stay away! Would I come back? Yes, I've been here before & other dishes are pretty good. Will avoid this quinoa bean deal. The waitress did offer to take it back and get me something else but the omelette pretty much filled me up."}, {"review_id": "LfzD2lhi5m8m2syHL00eOg", "user_id": "ApjSaDZD9OeSqimHE9Qo0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "OMG, you better wear stretchy pants when eating at Eggsclusive Cafe.  The food portions are huge and can feed two or three people.  I am a big eater and I couldn't finish half the food.I ordered the 5 egg \"not so garden\" omelet, so that is code for an omelet full of meat.  The omelet was very good; one of the best that I have ever had.  The cheese was perfectly melted and the eggs were fully cooked...not runny.  The huge portion of hash browns were plain and needed some seasoning, but this is my only complaint.  Add some paprika or cajun spices to make the hash browns a little better.  Then they bring the pancakes out.  I had forgotten that pancakes came with the breakfast.  So after a huge 5 egg meat omelet and enough hash browns to feed a horse, here come the pancakes.  Two large pancakes covered in powdered sugar now face me and I am about to explode.  I poured the syrup over the pancakes and took a bite.  The pancakes tasted good, the syrup was very good...not bottled syrup, but the pancakes were a little tough.  Maybe the batter was made the day before?The service was very good.  I want to come back and try their breakfast skillets.  Also, I like their round menus...something different!My ticket before tip was $14.60."}, {"review_id": "Ndk1bcq9Cdm4qJ87OynNZw", "user_id": "FfWWv6fSjh-m9-dkESMsYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "I love this breakfast/brunch spot! They serve a lot of food so come prepared to eat! I got the combo #2 that came with 2 eggs, choice of meat and Cinnabon that came with cinnamon butter and syrup. It was quite delicious! I've also had their butcher Benedict's and skillet before which are both good, I'd prefer the benedict over the skillet though just because the skillets and omelets is way too much food for me! And also their Eggsclusive potatoes over the hash brown! For drinks, I love the freshly squeezed orange juice, they also serve \"liquid breakfast\" (mimosas, bloody Mary's, etc..) which is always a plus!"}, {"review_id": "kqpMNNl8Wkg8-sfMDyxJvw", "user_id": "zLABDPqk5gA-avT37yP7rA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Great breakfast spot! Huge portions, fresh coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice and yummy mimosas! I have been here many times and have always had a great experience. They have many options, many combos that you can change. The waitress was very accommodating, I got scrambled eggs, 1 bacon, 1 sausage link, a strawberry crepe and a mimosa. The waitress gave me an option to have Nutella drizzled on the crepe. My friend got one of the skillets and a cup of coffee, that cup was never empty and the waitress even offered a Togo cup which I think is a very nice touch. It's one of my favorite spots that I visit often & will continue to return."}, {"review_id": "VWY8R3B4-vr90X3-vegxeA", "user_id": "VVMaySN-f1xSPWmJoyeqfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Fantastic breakfast options here.

What we did not read in any of those reviews was how loud it is in the restaurant. High ceilings, tile floor, and lots of windows makes the noise bounce. The temperature varies drastically from the front door to the far end of the restaurant. The air circulation relies on two small ceiling fans that are located high above the tables. We sat in a booth and we could both feel the springs and lack of cushion in the seats. The food was plentiful and good, but it wasn't anything that I would go out of my way to eat. The coffee is good, but the cups are on the small side, which we know means that you're constantly filling it up and changing the balance of cream and sugar. The service was above average. The host was friendly despite being knee deep in a wait list. The server had personality and recommendations. The cashier asked about our visit and actually seemed engaged when we provided honest and balanced feedback."}, {"review_id": "vdbrs1dwiF4W1cjr9g3LcQ", "user_id": "zAqZ1p2xuOmUwsV34eq6IQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/28/2017", "text": "The service was pretty good! The waitress was very nice. The place was also nice and clean.I got the butcher Benedict and it was really good.  My family got other breakfast options, including the Arlington Benedict and the Rocky Mountain skillet. They said it was pretty good. The orange juice is very fresh - we sat right by the juicer and watched it do its thing (not sure if the oranges were washed though since the stickers were still on them).The one thing is that the portion sizes are way too large for one person. We each ate about 1/2 or less of our meals and took the rest home. First few bites got us full for some reason.Overall, would recommend trying this place out. However, sharing a plate with someone else might be a good thing you consider!"}, {"review_id": "xBC2QxmSaMLUczFscuOJNQ", "user_id": "Sdl16X0C9ecQFDhLw9yp5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Pretty good selection of mimosas and juices.  I had the chicken waffles with the spicy sauce - very tasty just that the sauce we as bit bland and not really spicy.  They have quite a few options in their menu except for basic chicken and waffles.  Def.

Nice brunch place with a large patio.  They have your standard breakfast fare with some updates. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is great and solid cup of coffee. The food is pretty good although some are definitely better than others. Last time I had the chicken tinga and was not impressed. The chicken was dry and the pico lacked flavor. The pancakes as a side were very tasty and my favorite part of the meal. I've had an omelette before and much preferred it over the tinga. Their portions are ridiculously enormous and priced accordingly. Granted it is packed on the weekends, but service is slow and just so-so.  Overall, while it isn't a stand out in my book, it is solid brunch place to hit in town."}, {"review_id": "eI76AIRT4C4xzc4nqAIrQw", "user_id": "gOvyzwiHbuRT_i5PMq9UQQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/30/2017", "text": "Great place for brunch, lots of options on their me u as well as morning cocktails.Pros: patio under the pergola is a nice spot, great wait staff, clean well laid establishment and the food was perfectly prepared.Cons: I'm only giving this place a three star rating because their portions are ginormous and if you ask to split that you get a $2 upcharge on an already 15 dollar plate."}, {"review_id": "-THv-wbCP9ecqP3cHCeofA", "user_id": "KTxgEt7HsDq-MFcGOJaJ4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "We had an amazing dining experience at Eggsclusive this morning!

We were staying in a hotel not far away and Yelp led us to try Eggsclusive Cafe. I judge all Breakfast spots by their Hash Browns and I was pleased that they let you choose between potatoes and Hash Browns...they get a gold star for that! I had my usual Skillet as it has the highest capta of Hashbrowns of any Breakfast entree usually. I ordered the Rocky Mountain Skillet that had Ham, Peppers and Tomato. They nailed it! It might have been the best Skillet I have ever had. Hash Browns were really crisped and brown, well cooked veggies a step most places miss. It was large, I ended up taking half or so home. My wife had a open face Bacon Cheese and Scrambled egg sandwich on a biscuit that looked great and she could only finish half. They have freshly squeezed juice, the strawberry orange I had was eggceptional. If all that wasn't enough the Pancakes on the side were first rate as well...Hope we get back to Rockford soon to go again...its it wrong to drive an hour just for Breakfast...maybe not."}, {"review_id": "dtGmw3CsMnISW_6YE1dtYg", "user_id": "0k_9sqGTXoMSzhQTi6ZsUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "This by far is my favorite place for breakfast.
