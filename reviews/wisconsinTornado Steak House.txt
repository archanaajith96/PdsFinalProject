Steak sandwiches were gone by midnight, so def comekn the earlier side if you want that!I ended up getting the meunster burger and fries, along with a cocktail.Cocktails were pretty decent! Some of my friends were a little bit sweet. Burger was A+, the meat had a really good texture and the taste was definitely there! Melted cheese over the patty was soooo good.Fries were average. The texture was very good, crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. Only problem is that it was bland and not salted at all. I usually like my fries with a bit of preseasoning.Cool atmosphere!"}, {"review_id": "TfSqvF8FFcOquzC1JPNUoQ", "user_id": "4VSaSL3ik7Pf_xgUyHG93w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Order the 28 oz. ribeye on the bone, it was a really good decision.

Both for birthdays celebrations, and both fantastic! On both occasions I felt like everything was moving at a slower than usual pace. From drinks to appetizers to meal, it was slow and drawn out. Maybe that's the point here? I don't know. Our meal this evening with a group of 8 was roughly 2.25 hours start to finish. I wasn't in a hurry either time, so that doesn't really matter to me. Just keep in mind upon visiting, it wont be a quick ordeal.Service, however, was amazing both times. The wait staff is on point, for sure. Aside from slow delivery of food (and they were busy) everything was great!The food itself... omg. So good. I had salmon the first visit and filet the second. Both were incredible. The filet was some of the best steak I've had in Madison, hands down. I had asparagus the first visit and Brussels sprouts the second as my sides - both wonderful and cooked perfectly. Daily soup offerings were potato and then crab bisque. Both were very good. The bisque - excellent. Overall - do I recommend checking this place out? YES. You will not be disappointed. I am a fan!Final note - bathrooms suck. Small, old, cramped. If I am paying $60 for a steak, give me a nice restroom please."}, {"review_id": "RX_5dwU75drzp5u0gUtBlA", "user_id": "kh_FXguZJv4lQ1BFSMA08g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "This was our go to steak house / supper club when we lived in madison.

Bonus treat was we sat downstairs for the first time.  Its like its own club and has a frank Sinatra / Sammy Davis vibe.  Like either guy could just walk in at any time. Food was solid as always. I had a 16 oz NY strip cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Wifey had 8 oz fillet. Hers was perfect too. I splurged and had their world famous hash browns. Omg good.

Took over an hour to get food.  Granted this isn't outback, but it seemed excessive.  If you want great steak, definitely try it!!"}, {"review_id": "k2_GDHv9obMi2d4NPReWLQ", "user_id": "ddDPOUDTV3RdwkRuYu1GLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "When stepping into Tornado Steak House, you feel as if your in the 1970's and you feel people should be smoking cigars. The atmosphere and wooden walls makes you feel as if you are in a movie. To begin with, the service was fantastic. My boyfriend and I got served fresh baked bread basically right when we were seated. They have an extensive cocktail and wine menu to choose from. The cocktails are strong and it is so worth the splurge on them ($10-$12). In addition, our waitress was phenomenal and had great knowledge of the menu and wines. When we asked about the different wines to pair with our main dishes, she recommended 3-4 different types depending on our taste preferences. Each entree comes with an appetizer salad and a side which is included in the price. Both my boyfriend and I got a ceasar salad to begin with, which was amazing. My boyfriend got the New York Strip steak with a baked potato. The potato came with butter and sour cream on the side. I got the salmon and a side of fries. At the end of the meal we were both stuffed."}, {"review_id": "j2kK6mpdr-eWVdKC8j3I4g", "user_id": "j-Rhgn6jAwaTcqdmBT1YBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "After a show at the High Noon (Snail Mail - check her out, she's 17 and rocks!), my partner and I were both a few drinks in and in search of some yummy grub. I'd heard good things about the Tornado late night menu so we decided to walk over to satisfy our late night cravings for red meat. It was Saturday night and the weather was amazing for January, so the place was pretty busy with people who presumably had had a few and were hungry too, but we didn't wait too long to be seated. My partner and I had the steak sandwich, which was absolutely scrumptious. The meat was juicy and tender, the caramelized onions were a good touch, and the bun was well toasted and crunchy. There was a lot of horseradish sauce on the sandwich so I'd probably get it on the side next time. For $9 for a steak sandwich, you really can't beat the price. So if you're looking for a cheap satisfying eat on a Saturday night, look no further than the Tornado Room."}, {"review_id": "NhNVpl6d5jxM06NfI4gCFg", "user_id": "T3TxHHWRJ2hnTwlLeHu1VQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Go there.

The main dining room is so unexpectedly Northwoods Cabin feeling! It's like dining in a log cabin with no windows.....but in a good way!Went on a Sunday evening, when the daily special is herb chicken with dressing, potatoes, & green beans. It comes with bread, veggie/olive relish tray (in a glass) plus your choice of soup or salad. That's a huge amount of delicious food for a very reasonable price! After devouring a huge wedge salad, I could barely eat my chicken dinner. On the plus side: they neatly pack up your leftovers. My dining mate tried the pork tenderloin with cherry sauce. He said it was decent but not exciting.  He started with the soup of the day: cream of wild mushroom with blue cheese...he enjoyed it.We were a little surprised both the soup & salads AND the two main meals took a bit too long to arrive.

It gets great reviews and everyone raves about it. We've tried a handful of times but they were always already booked up.Finally we were able to make reservations for 7:45 Friday night in mid-June. We were seated quickly after arrival. Our table was in the back corner. Everything is wooden and has a very stereotypical supper-club feel. I appreciated that they had the relish accouterments (carrot, celery, olive, cherry tomato, cucumber) in a high-ball glass. I like the originality.Our server was prompt and friendly. She told us the specials. She made a comment that it was about time, so I had the impression the menu does not change very often. Speaking of the menu, this leads to one of my only two complaints. It was quite dark where we were. I think this is supposed to be romantic but I had to hold my menu up to the faint light to read.My second complaint and this is the serious one, is it was ridiculously hot. They obviously know this is a problem and there were numerous fans blowing in our room. But where I was sitting there was no breeze. Twice I had to get up and walk outside to cool off. Sitting in the booth I couldn't stop sweating. This was the only downside to the evening but it was a big one.Our beverages were unique and perfectly concocted. Our entrees were everything we heard they would be. I had venison and my partner had a filet. Perfectly cooked, excellent flavor, tasty sides.I would go back and try the Tornado Steak House again but I don't think I would go during the summer months. The heat definitely skewed my experience and I'm lowering my rating because of it."}, {"review_id": "Xbvaks1BhlU8BuR3ZFaBcg", "user_id": "izb4p2meMvhnvssvciQzeA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "In town for business and his restaurant was suggested by some locals.

The reviews gave me to believe it would be cozy, which also suited my mood. I had a book, hunger, and a thirst for local brew. Tornado seemed like it checked all the boxes. I came in through the back, in the bar. Normally flying solo, I'd pull up some bar and settle in, but there were no seats. Mind you, this was 6:35 on a Wednesday.Making my way to the (disinterested, dismissive, balding) host, I asked if there was a small table I could occupy. No--but i could grab something in the bar. Winding my way back through, still no seats at the bar, but there was an open booth. I sat. First round, food (french onion soup, steak, hash browns), second round, and a scotch to settle the meal. Everything was fine. Not stellar, not bad. Incredibly loud. I was, without ceremony, without asking, brought my check. Here you are sir, move the **** along. Message received. My bill, with tip, was $80 for just over an hour of booth time (and two beers, dinner, and an oban 14). The food was good, but not remarkably so. The service (server: Rachel) was adequate. Being shuffled unceremoniously out the door, however cordially? Chintzy. Honestly, I'm not being used to being treated like riff-raft. Disconcerting. Apparently spending $80 in an hour isn't enough booth rental of a Wednesday night. So if you want to be rushed through an okay, somewhat overpriced meal, Tornado is the place. Live it up for 45 minutes or so then grab your coat. If you're looking to take your time and enjoy yourself, if you're looking for a remarkable experience, or if you just want to feel like the business you're sitting respects their customers, look elsewhere. Not considering the treatment, this might've been a 3/5 review. As it stands, I'm not looking to go back regardless of circumstance. Hence, 1/5."}, {"review_id": "0NLHB3SoPDeDnzotXuKSBw", "user_id": "SnEevPuFKkfsrVm25xyhoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "Best steak I've ever had.Classic atmosphere.
