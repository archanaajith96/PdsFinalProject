Portions were generous, the meal came out relatively quickly after we ordered, and the staff were friendly. I had the Chicken Pita, which was absolutely full of flavor, and well executed.The Gyro combo plate boasted all the depth of flavors you would expect with gyro meat. The falafels were done well, and deserve a mention in their own right.If you like Mediterranean food, you will not be disappointed here."}, {"review_id": "cmhlH_0a6ymS0GwVfpb7Ug", "user_id": "V-t5kzCb6TBJP-kKU61n0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Outstanding menu and service.

Two locations to serve you, but the South one by Apache Mall has more seating and shorter lines. The food is always top notch. Real grilled chicken breast, soft pitas, and tztiki. Served with a small Greek salad and rice (fries are available too). Fast casual at its finest. Stop in if you haven't."}, {"review_id": "KHWa5hc8SGwBxQcb-0eaXg", "user_id": "btdMwcbzwNPbsCcI-cLl4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "My longtime Rochester favorite! Nupa never disappoints. I've tried chicken pitas, gyro salads, the spicy feta dip (incredible), and a few other things, and everything is fresh and delicious. I even got my graduation party food catered from here! My go-to is definitely the gyro salad - gyro meat, lettuce, tomato, onion, olives, pepperoncini peppers, and pita bread with tzatziki. The tzatziki can be a hit or a miss - sometimes its thickness differs or the yogurt taste overpowers the cucumber, but usually it's wonderful. Service is generally positive - attentive and friendly."}, {"review_id": "Iunkpb3IY4Ncr3baOjjy6A", "user_id": "0dIvVs3PY64bE3PZF-8V8A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/26/2017", "text": "Fast Greek Food.  The inside of this place is nothing to write home about.  I love greek food and the pitas, rice, falafel, and gyro meat were all good and I would go again if I lived in the area.  I did not like that I could not get a scoop of hummus with my pita without having to pay extra.  I think you should get that on a plate.  The lunch specials are the same price as the plates so not seeing how it is a special.  I have had much better Gyro meat but I have also had much worse.  Middle of the road for me."}, {"review_id": "lnkCe5EeeCh55HM57zALsA", "user_id": "6kqm5mDiy8rTqxAy97hl9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2016", "text": "Nupa is definitely a top five in Rochester. Location: The two cafes have different feels to them. The Barlow Nupa is older, has not been updated, and has very limited seating. It gives you the feeling of being in a diner. The Nupa on the south side is spacious, has lots of seating, and modern furniture and art on the walls. Two totally different dining experiences, depending on your preferences. I prefer the south location between the two. Menu: The menu has all the Greek and Greek tourist, as they say, classics. gyros, kebobs, baklava, and egg lemon soup. My personal favorite dish though, is the falafel salad. Six huge falafels on a bed of romaine, feta, red onion, banana peppers, and warm pita triangles. Amazing. Tip from a local: Dinner is great, but if you want a deal, go at lunch. A drink and full plate, which is the same size as dinner, is a combo price of 8.50- 9.00 bucks. The same thing runs a few extra dollars with no drink for dinner. I recommend the falafel salad, or the classic gyro meal with the greek salad."}, {"review_id": "E2GbW1wRvpGIB5upajbYlQ", "user_id": "BIWnH3yjzrcdgw5ADX9nvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2017", "text": "I really like their gyro. Afraid to try the falafel, not sure if Greeks do falafel at all.. they look a lot paler than middle eastern falafel. Anyway. Lamb gyro is delicious. I have it every time I'm here. I also like getting take out, it's easy to eat at home. The place is big and clean. Looks like a fast food chain on the inside, not much of an ambiance. But I guess that's not their goal anyway."}, {"review_id": "RW9dbAz_yaqpXX3Q1aJHqQ", "user_id": "Y0U5Y2aFQKY-bW_xKAl0-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Delicious food!  We got the regular gyros and Greek salads that were top notch.  Also had a Caprese Floretta that was terrific.  Staff was very friendly and kept the very full crowd moving.  We got our order to go and there was so much food, we thought they gave us extra."}, {"review_id": "TS49ePGhqEOG4wV_ABZT5Q", "user_id": "tUsrdWOWjOGf_hTsjMKycA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2017", "text": "We had take-out from here a night or two ago with Mr. Piano's family. I thought I had ordered the veggie plate, but I may have accidentally ordered the veggie pita, so it may make some sense to double-check on your order--a lot of it can probably sound similar if you're not a particularly loud speaker. Mr. Piano gave me a falafel from his falafel pita, so I can indeed say that the falafel are pretty good, and I think I would have enjoyed the veggie plate more since the veggie pita has no falafels, but even as a plain veggie pita it was pretty good! I got the side of fries, and those were decent and probably would have been even better if we'd eaten in rather than gotten take-out.The interior appeared to be clean and was nicely decorated--I like the hand-painted pot next to the cashier that may have been made at the neighboring Color Me Mine :)Overall, seems like a nice dinner place and probably a great lunch place given the lunch specials. I'm glad I got a chance to stop by on our visit!"}, {"review_id": "laJJDXF_Vf2Of3iMHO80Dw", "user_id": "spLiUhwvvzLjS0HK8JyhDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Shout out to team Nupa this afternoon!
