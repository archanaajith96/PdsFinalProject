I had the half chicken and for only $10 I got a gigantic plate of moist, falling off the bone chicken in aromatic spices, as well as rice (fine), pickled vegetables, and baba ghanouj---you can pick any appetizer you want as a side, and I recommend this one heartily. It had great flavor and went well with the pita bread. Just watch out for the bones in the chicken. My husband had the falafel platter and said it was fantastic. However, my favorite thing by far was the garlic sauce. I dipped everything in it but I could have eaten it right from the spoon, it was that good and addictive. Make sure you ask for this!"}, {"review_id": "RcWUgQ9rJ-Q--_3rrq8hVQ", "user_id": "-6UX03y_cs8WtAOhK6BWAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Small, local, delicious - what could be better? I've picked up food a few times from ToL and have not been disappointed. My go-to is the falafel sandwich, usually with an order of baba ghanouj - both are terrific. Grape leaves are also good, fattoush and kebbe as well.Try something new, try something different, try something local and delicious - this is the place to go."}, {"review_id": "IzSZvmi3PZM9m27qWRR0Ew", "user_id": "FbxIMGmubYW5ukS1IiPjpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "This place is simply wonderful. It's an ethnic culinary experience, it's fast casual, and completely affordable. The place is clean with an open kitchen layout, that adds to the vibe.The staff is very friendly and will answer any questions and help you decide what's best for your taste. I told the girl that my Shawarma sandwich was so good. I'm going to get a rotisserie and put it next to my bed. Every couple hours, I'll slice a couple hunks of beef/lamb shawarma off and eat it, roll back over and go to sleep. Get the mango drink in the cooler. Then get a couple more to go. You'll thank me later."}, {"review_id": "u8c0O0kPwinLMZz76pq9WQ", "user_id": "Zwjb6xl2zzdw1AOwfh46-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "This place is absolutely incredible. Could not recommend it more. I believe it's a family run business, at they very least everything is made in house and has that home-cooked taste.I was in the area rotating as a medical student at Baystate about 5 minutes away and came here pretty much every other day after I discovered it.They have a great value meal costing 12.99 that includes a drink, two meats of your choice, a ton of pita bread and rice, and two sides. It's a very very generous amount of food!As far as meats I've tried all their kabobs and all the meat here is incredibly well seasoned and tender. I've also had their meat pies (can't remember the name at the moment) and their falafels. Sides I've tried: fries here are amazingly well seasoned. The hummus is homemade and sometimes they run out because it's made in house. The tabbouleh is crisp and fresh. Honestly it's hard to pick just a few things.If you're in the area or not even just come here for some great Lebanese/Mediterranean food. You absolutely will not regret it!"}, {"review_id": "JJZRowdDFqQjgs66WUfwGQ", "user_id": "tIl_voqQIE7nWrvR1i0p3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Favorite take out Mediterranean food!

The liquid from the tabbouleh and fattoush watered down the hummus and baba a bit.  Just a suggestion not a complaint.  We also had delicious spinach pie, spinach manousheh, and nomoura.  All were wicked good!   We left very satisfied and the portions were big enough that we had extra to snack on later.  All-in-all, everything was great!  If you like Middle Eastern food then check these guys out.

We were the only customers there when we first walked in (although by the time we left many other people were seated) and we placed our order at the counter. There is a small (very no-frills) seating area where we waited until our food was ready. The special mixed platter comes with choice of two meats and two sides with a soda. Both the lamb/beef shawarma and the chicken tawook were delicious and spiced/seasoned very well (although maybe slightly too salty). The sides of hummus and grape leaves were fantastic - these were some of the best grape leaves I have had! The shawarma sandwich with crispy French fries was also a hit, and we tried a tasty beef kibbeh ball on the side.Two important tips: if you like garlic make sure to ask for the garlic paste because it's an awesome condiment. Also, if you do NOT like parsley tell them ahead of time because otherwise all your food will come doused it in!"}, {"review_id": "g_b2_VYbSQVBVbDLdjqvSg", "user_id": "VZt37GDS0fEEQNDMzsdFpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2017", "text": "This was the first time I had authentic Lebanese food and it was amazing.

This restaurant is about the food and the people, both are excellent!  The owner and his family run a tight ship and seem to really enjoy what they do and like their customers as well!  We sat next to a very friendly extended Lebanese family who traveled an hour and a half to eat Lebanese food even though they have Lebanese restaurants in their own area. My wife, my 14 year old son and my 80 year old mom all shared a mixed grill platter, an assorted appetizer plate, a sausage manousheh (similar to a yummy thin crust cheese and sausage pizza), and a couple baklava's for dessert to split. We even had a little left over to take home. Portions are generous so plan accordingly or look forward to lunch the next day.  If you're looking for a fancy date spot this isn't it, but if you're looking to share a nice cultural experience with a date it would work quite well. If I lived closer I would get take out a couple times a month as it's delicious food.
