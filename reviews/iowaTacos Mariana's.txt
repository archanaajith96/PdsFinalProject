A bit of a hole in the wall, Tacos Mariana's is worth venturing off the beaten path to visit. First, don't miss the guacamole. The first time we got it, the fresh cucumbers made me wonder what was going on. Now, I'm a believer. Hands down the best guacamole. The rest of the menu doesn't disappoint, either. There are plenty of options for both meat-eaters and vegetarians, and all are generous in size. We regularly switch up what we order but have never been disappointed.While there aren't margaritas, the beer and Jarritos are fine by me.If you haven't been to Tacos Marianas, do yourself a favor and get there ASAP!"}, {"review_id": "MTa2Pw_oVmFzMbpYBjU8gw", "user_id": "hos0VHhtsEogGFwvX8dzcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Mariana's is my absolutely favorite Mexican restaurant. I have been going here since she was in the Drake neighborhood. I slowly worked my way through her menu, but some of my favorites are: Carna Asada, Steak Ranchero, Torta, Horchata, and of course her tacos. The decor reminds you of Mariana's home town San Sebastian and a lot of the furnature is actually from there. I have also taken various visitors from South America and they have always enjoyed the food there."}, {"review_id": "hEo4jhVaRND_E9_kCCmkAA", "user_id": "fZMPvpzg8mvWdq0nrOLz3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "I have been dying to try this place and yesterday for lunch was finally the chance!!The hours on the door say they open at 11am. My mom and aunt arrived at 1140 and they were still closed. But as they were calling me the owner arrived and unlocked the doors. The parking lot is kind of haphazard. It's fairly small in the side and along the front of the building. At points. You are actually driving up the curb to park. And there is broken concrete debri all over the driveway so watch your step!The restaurant inside is super small, but clean and brightly painted. The outside of the building is a little off putting but the inside is much nicer. I would say this is your stereotypical hole in the wall restaurant.  The service is slow. The waitresses aren't going to act like your friends. But the food is fantastic. We started with the chips, salsa and guacamole. The red salsa is good. The green salsa will burn your mouth up, if you're into that. And omg the guacamole is to die for!!!!  It has cucumbers, green onion, cilantro and jalepeno. I couldn't get enough of it!!We ordered chicken tacos, carnitas tacos, a vegetarian tostada and pupusas. The tostada was very oldly shaped and hard to eat without making a mess. The tacos we good but needed something. We added salsa or guacamole and salt to them and then they were fabulous. I love authentic tacos and street tacos. But these were a tad bland so that's why we doctored them up. The papayas though!  I would come back to this place just for that guacamole and the papusas. I think those were the best things I've eaten in a long time. So overall, it wasn't the best Mexican I've ever had, but there were definitely reasons why I would be happy to return."}, {"review_id": "KqUOpNa3XoT7BDbUWTuZ2w", "user_id": "koA9hB_bP4e2CyxzU2xGPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "I've searched far and wide for something to replicate the street tacos I had in Mexico...and I've found them.

I can't believe I never checked this place out. It has a cozy Mom n pop restaurant feel. The food is authentic... or at least I think it is based on some of the restaurants I been in Mexico. The staff is nice and price is decent. I really enjoyed the beef tongue Taco. Sounded risky but I'm glad I tried it. The soup was good, but not the absolute best I tried.

We started with chips and salsa (they are not complementary) chips were good, wasnt a fan of the red salsa, the green salsa was very hot and good flavor! I had the Adobada and Birria tacos, both were very good with flavorful meat. They are authentic street style, the cilantro and radish tasted fresh! I shared the pork and cheese popusas and we both would definately have them again! After trying popusas at the farmers market I've wanted to try them at other places! I also had the rice and beans, rice was ok, but I loved the refried beans! Definately homemade, and my friend who is a bean hater even liked them. We ended with fried ice cream, which didnt seem to be fried.. oh well still ok. Prices are amazing, we had 4 tacos 3 popusas, rice, beans, chips and salsa and dessert for about $20! The outside doesnt look inviting, but deffinately worth going inside! Parking isn't the greatest.  A must try if you are a taco fanatic like myself!The inside is very nice and seemed clean. The server didn't really talk just took our order and filled our water once. I had to go to the Hostess table to wait for someone to come out of the kitchen so I could ask for dessert. We went around 2pm and it wasn't busy, took a little long to get the food but it was worth it! The food gets 5 stars!"}, {"review_id": "H_NgxHgg01_5sR4ahEfaPA", "user_id": "88AY14XGwGbLAjxsTs1E1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/25/2017", "text": "Tacos tacos tacos! You can't lose if you get tacos!

That being said, if you're short on time consider elsewhere. They also don't have room for large groups.Taco Mariana's has one of the better guacs I've had the opportunity of trying. I really like that they have cucumber as an ingredient--it's so refreshing. Their tacos are reasonably priced and all the meats are well seasoned. They also have decent papusas but nothing to write home about. They have additional items on the weekends that are a MUST: pazole, tamales, and ceviche (shrimp and fish). I would highly recommend these items but they often run out so call ahead of time if you plan to dine in. If you had to choose between the shrimp or Fish ceviche, go with the fish! SO GOOD!

Let me just say: \"This place is F**KING FANTASTIC\"! The menu isn't huge, but everything we had was pretty friggin' good! The wife had the Pozole special - A gigantic bowl of one of the most delicious pozole's we've ever had. We ordered full meals for the kids too (as we knew we'd want to try other things!). The boy received the chicken empanadas, and the girl got the pork and cheese pupusas. The pupusas were FIRE! However, the empanadas were not what we were expecting. The empanadas we are accustomed to in Central America are served plain and crispy, while these had a salsa over the top of them. They weren't bad, just different than what we're used to. I had my standard order of however many tacos I think I can eat on any particular day. This day, I felt I could handle six. While I love all taco fillings (lengua, cabeza, tripas, etc), I decided to stick with al pastor and carne asada. Both were killer! For drinks the kids and wife had milkshakes, while I enjoyed an horchata.On the tables were your standard hot sauces, but one stood out as I had never encountered it before: Salsa Huichol - This stuff is AMAZING! It's not too hot, but has some amazing earthy flavors that really stood out on my carne asada tacos. The label says its ingredients come from the Nayar Mountains. I'm guessing \"Nayar\" means Flavor!It's not likely our family will be back in Des Moines any time soon. But, if we are, we'll make sure to stop here again."}, {"review_id": "ytpfaiRqGn7W4xlZQd7bPQ", "user_id": "YPDGAc1k32OAtAh_9raAOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/30/2017", "text": "After having left Des Moines for over two years I was a little scared my favorite taco place, if not my favorite casual restaurant, in Des Moines might be gone or have changed but I am happy to report Taco's Mariana's is as delicious and charming as ever.
