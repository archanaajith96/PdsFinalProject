I had a small wedding with immediate family and close friends this January and afterwards we ate here for our small reception and reserved the Red Room for about 25-30 people.    The staff was amazing. They greeted all of us as soon as we entered and made a point to introduce themselves to the bride and groom. Each one who served us congratulated us. They were extremely helpful and attentive.    Our cake was late to arrive and they called the bakery several times on our behalf. When our cake didn't arrive from the bakery the manager offered to FIND or MAKE us a cake. That was the most thoughtful offer I could ever imagine from them.    If you are looking to host a large group of people do not hesitate to reserve a room at Benvenuti's. My family and I will return often despite not living in the Norman area.   The food was perfect and delicious and my friends and family are still talking about how good it was."}, {"review_id": "ygjWg60SINkBbYguLsPEfg", "user_id": "0NpsHL0fzaqG3WFu7HS3pA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "We did not have a good experience at this restaurant.  Our group reserved a private dinning room 2 months prior to our event and let the team know we would have x number of guests for dinner.  Unfortunately, four people in our party had to stand holding their plates and two other disgruntled guests not with our party stole two bottles of wine that our group got stuck with the bill."}, {"review_id": "PV79jwuEj6yrcKXCO4ej-w", "user_id": "PdWzHNLTLDqOqQ95ztOb2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "A very nice restaurant, especially for a special occasion.  The bruscetto was truly the best I have ever had and the entrees were very good.    My wife had the lamb chops which were the best she ever had and I had the perfectly prepared sea bass.  Quite delicious!"}, {"review_id": "1XPTMbS4tQdwDgUFtLk_hA", "user_id": "LMFKTb0nwTiCNpDSU9C0mA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Gluten free Italian donuts...need I say more.

As was with my first occasion, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The restaurant decor was relaxed and elegant, and the menu was diverse and creative. This time, we started with the crab fingers, truffle fries, sriracha shrimp, and bruschetta. All were good, but I do recommend the mussels above all others. The broth of the mussels mixes perfectly with their wonderfully flakey bread. In our party, we had several vegetarians and one vegan, and the waiter was more than able to make recommendations and substitutions to the entire party's tastes. I myself decided on the Lobster Fazzoletti, which came in a saffron cream sauce with mushrooms and asparagus. I enjoyed it but felt the sauce was rather thin and the lobster over cooked. My friend had ordered the Veal Parmigiana, which is served over angel hair, bone in, and looks amazing in presentation. He said it was very good and the evening was enjoyable overall. I would definitely recommend if you are in town looking for an upscale, yet comfortable dining location. Unfortunately, we were so wrapped up in conversation, I didn't have the sense to take better photos, sorry."}, {"review_id": "1o2Ay0LJfkp4aqxgs93mIw", "user_id": "si_kwKORHo_npYC3LpN2Rg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2017", "text": "Delicious and authentic Italian food in Norman,OK.

The grilled vegetables with pesto, hummus and grilled chicken added was great! It was my mom's birthday they didn't have any cheesecake which she was upset about.

The deserts change seasonally for the most part. while keeping a few of the old favorites around for repeat eaters. My favorites are the flourless chocolate torte, or the chocolate mousse cake.

I worried the server would get all snooty because we didn't order entrees, but he was great. The meatballs (two in an order) are HUUUGE. Plus they're full of ballsy flavor and so tender. I don't remember the name of the cocktail, but it was perfection. And grown up.

Conscientious, as I am, with the concerns of even the most value minded, would this traditional version, at $17, quadruple the flavour and enjoyment experienced from the contents found within the little red box found amongst your local merchant's frozen goods? Could Chef Compagni, seen making the rounds, elevate a dish found from one end of thy Kingdom to the other to unheard of heights? How does one even do that? Dunno. The Royal curiosity succumbed to more carnivorous cravings and the ($34) bone in Veal Parmigiana (also not listed online).We received perfect side salad portions splitting a ($7) salad that was a harmonious blend of rocket, kalamata, red onion, sun-dried tomato pesto, pine nuts and a tart goat cheesed (halved) crostini, Also delivered, fresh from the hot hearth, a complimentary, course salt sprinkled mini loaf of crusty bread to enjoy with the virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar found bottled at each table. Yum.In a timely fashion our entrees arrived. Hers, an excellent tasting version of garlic scampi with halved grape tomahto and fresh capellini, that may, possibly, could only have benefited from a couple more moments in the fire in order to develop a bit more. IOW, mere seconds from perfection. Mine, a pounded then crumbed, perfectly seasoned and pan-fried, bone-on portion of tender baby bovine the size of the Royal mug. Served piping hot with remnants of crispness peaking from under an expertly (not over-sauced) blanket of tart tangy red sauce crowned with shavings from the King of cheeses, Parmigiana, and a side of toothsome house made capellini it was....Exemplary.Rich, creamy layers of vanilla custard, trifled, if you will, with coffee soaked cookies served in an Irish coffee glass was a fine version of tiramisu that was just big enough for the gentleman who truly just wants taste (or two) of something sweet and the lady who expresses the same (though miraculously finds room to finish it off). Being blessed, compared to other Kingdoms, with our relatively uncongested thoroughfares, BV's is well worth any journey, from any distance, from within thy Kingdom,  Looking forward to game day @ Volare (and the BV lasagna) sometime soon.Well done Chef, well done."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/benvenutis-norman-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
