I can't count how many times Lindsay came to check on me! Note...I noticed other servers doing the same. It speaks to the organization and how they train their employees. They were all very nice, respectful and attentive! I loved it!I ordered the crab cakes, Char burger and fries and I also ordered a Rum Runner (i think). Lindsay was so attentive that she inquired if ordering a half order of crab cakes would be a better option since a full order was 2. She made a good call because I wouldn't have been able to eat 2 crab cakes, a burger and fries! My rum runner was a bit strong and since I had to drive I didn't want to drink it all. Lindsay suggested taking it back to the bar and having them add something to it which turned out perfectly. The food was really good and the service alone was outstanding and I would return just for the customer service experience! I love an establishment that has great customer service! Actually, she reminded me of Chick-fila employees! Lol That's just how friendly she was!!! Keep it up Char!!"}, {"review_id": "qc7pXm4WWJqEBLr3zKTB4A", "user_id": "N0eKUs-mGXLCvKJcLrwdyQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "One word: meh.I found this place on Yelp while visiting Jackson and I figured I would try it. I ordered the chicken & waffles to go. I was so excited to try it but I was very disappointed.The chicken was chicken strips which is fine. The issue is that it was not at all seasoned. It's like they took raw chicken strips, coated them in flour, and threw them in some hot oil. You cannot fry chicken with no seasoning; it does not taste good. The waffle was nice and fluffy; it's honestly the only reason this review is 3 stars instead of 2. Based on this dish, I don't understand why some people rave about this place. I was absolutely not impressed."}, {"review_id": "WkGvyn1Jtj_Q1WvMaY_U2w", "user_id": "NZpjvCp6L8EJ0OozROd5fA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Wow. What can I say? Disappointed.  Maybe Mississippi isn't used to real Fine Dining.  The atmosphere and decor.....very nice except for the extremely loud piano bar within the restaurant.  The service.... top notch, no question about the service from our waiter but we were extremely disappointed with the hostess.  We arrived with half our party of 8 and was told we would not get seated for our reservation of 8 until everyone was there.  Now for the high priced food......we heard from so many that this place is fantastic, high quality, etc.....  My shrimp bisque was fantastic.  Hands down excellent.  My main course of the 16 oz Ribeye was priced at $36, I should have expected it to be \"Choice\" because it had to been.  It was tough and slightly chewy.  Ordered it Medium Rare, it came out Medium well.  Not much real flavor but justba bit of garlicky butter.  The sweet potatoes was OK. My cream spinach tasted fantastic but not pleasing to the eye.  Jackson, Mississippi I pray you get a Texas Roadhouse, then you will know what a great CHAR Ribeye is supposed to be like and hopefully one day you will get a Morton's Steakhouse or Vick and Anthony's. Then you will have real Fine Dining.Let me not this: we came here for the Restaurant.  Not the bar.  The bar was cool. Love the piano player in the bar.  If we wanted that then we would have came for that but it should be separated completely from the restaurant."}, {"review_id": "d9nMn40th031v08ut_gM-w", "user_id": "95z6HhgE4C9fKhhKyXmDLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "CharChicken piccata, filet (cooked perfectly), baked potato, and Char salad.

Everything was perfectly seasoned, prepared correctly, and down eight delicious. Don't miss the sautéed crab claws and the creamed spinach! It's a dressy atmosphere (which I love is followed and enforced). We started with drinks and the crab claws. I went for the \"Mississippi mule\" which has cathead honeysuckle vodka, strawberry simple syrup, and ginger beer. My husband is an old fashioned connoisseur, so he opted for that. It's made with Knob Creek if you don't specify differently, and it's a very large glass, but has some soda water in it which mellowed it out. ($11-$12). I asked the waiter if he had a preference on crab claw preference, and he recommended half fried, half sautéed. DO THIS! I've only ever had them fried, and the sautéed ones blew us away. They're in a delicious garlic butter and so full of flavor. For our entrees, we each got a special. I got the triple tail fish special (served w lump crab meat, fried green tomatoes, arugula salad, and a sriracha aioli) and my husband got the filet special (8oz with a no-filler crab cake, shrimp topper, and a side). The specials were really great deals considering all of the toppings. We split each entree so we could each enjoy the two specials. There wasn't one thing I would have changed. Perfect dinner! Oh, and the creamed spinach is the best I've ever had so definitely get that as your side! We were too stuffed to get dessert but the options sounded like the perfect end to a fancier date night!"}, {"review_id": "bKrqjreGe3NBpN08-x50cA", "user_id": "9veNiFvR7hOmPAZWS3nChA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Of the premier steakhouses in the jackson area, Char is definitely towards the top of my list.

I always get the vegetable plate. It's very filling and you have a choice of 3 vegetables or 4. I really like the smashed sweet potatoes, garlic cheddar stone grits, and the sweet potato fries. If you ask they will bring out this amazing bread to your table. It's a baguette with butter and it's soooo good. On saturdays they also have the brunch special of Pecan crusted chicken tenders with a choice of 2 sides. I've tried the pecan crusted chicken tenders and they are delicious and the portions are huge. You get practically 3 whole chicken breasts that come with honey chipotle dipping sauce. You can either get cornbread or the baguette with your entree also. Our waiter (Quentin) was super nice and polite and when they got my order wrong he immediately fixed it. The desserts are absolutely amazing if you aren't too full. The pecan caramel butter crunch is phenomenal. It's rich and caramel-y but also has the crunch from the pecans. I've never tried any of the appetizers or the salads but I'm sure they are great also.  This place can be busy during lunch on the weekends or a Friday but the wait has never been longer than 15 minutes."}, {"review_id": "lYCwGzRxjslHAaDF669UQg", "user_id": "ehE9x-K0MOBu615C1pR1AQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2017", "text": "Beautiful restaurant.

Char was a good time, although nothing really blew me away (aside from my salad... More on that later). Kevin, our server, was very attentive, helpful, and basically chose my meal for me! He suggested the Char salad topped in friend onion straws and I added salmon--THE BOMB DIGGITY! Hubs had the baked chicken breast and my mother-in-law had the duckling entree. No food complaints whatsoever, and all meats were cooked to perfection. Only thing to note was that the table bread was kinda rubbery (like undercooked) so we didn't eat it. But, we didn't need it either! As for the atmosphere and ambiance, Char is a bustling spot and seems very popular on Friday nights as it was quite loud. Char's design gives off a great \"steakhouse feel\" and the place smells amazing when you walk in. We were too stuffed for dessert, but had a great experience overall.

When I changed my order from a Gibson to a water (a Gibson was all I was interested in) the bartender suddenly became very short and inattentive with me. Not very professional. And it's not my fault your bar isn't properly stocked. I came in another time with my Dad and they were out of both the ribeye and the chicken.
