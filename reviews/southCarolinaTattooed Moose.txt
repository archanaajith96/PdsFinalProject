That's how I thankfully took a risk and ordered a sandwich I probably would've never ordered on my own: the Thanksgiving Sammy! I love sweet and savory flavors mixed together and this sandwich does its namesake justice. It takes like the greatest freshest Turkey Day leftovers sandwich! It gives me Monte Cristo vibes but with more complex flavors and less greasiness. I was worried the stuffing might dry out the sandwich or make it crumbly but it works so well. The other ubiquitous item in everyone's reviews are the Duck Fat Fries. Unfortunately when we went on a Tuesday around 8, they were out of Blue Cheese fondue so we just got plain Duck Fat fries. They were solid but nothing I'd go into lengthy, praising detail about. The biggest perk of going to TM? Meeting local doggos! We sat outside & met 3 the night we were there. Winning food & tail wagging floof sightings? I'll definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "uive3SZ70FzWeqWKDzKEIQ", "user_id": "Ku6kM8PmU3dd_ORJggBdNQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Mike's Famous Duck Club is one of the best sandwiches you'll ever find.

But the reason I come here isn't the drinks, it's definitely the food. The duck club and duck fat fries are amazing! The club comes with duck confit, bacon, lettuce, cheddar, red onion, tomatoes, and garlic aioli (I got it without tomatoes). The meat in the club was so tender and the flavors all together were top notch. I especially love their garlic aioli, which the fries come with as well. The club is a bit messy to eat but it's well worth the struggle. The fries themselves are so good; frying them in the duck fat adds such a great crisp and flavor. My friend got the burger with pimento cheese which she enjoyed as well. I will definitely come here again to try the other sandwiches! And of course to eat those fries again."}, {"review_id": "ReuKPejYaowXV293u7D-Nw", "user_id": "-mTCu9a-jm47vm-3XJo2bA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We saw this place featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives a few years back.

I love the blue cheese garlic fries and I always get it with the side of aioli to dip the plan fries in. This restaurant has something going for them. They have great food, good servers and a quirky hole in the wall atmosphere. My favorite sandwich is the thanksgiving Sammy. It comes with gravy on the side and is just so moist.

Unfortunately we did not like them.  The breading was delicious but the hotdog itself was very pink and mushy and tasted funky.  Since we only spent $2.50 we were too bothered by not being able to eat them.For dinner, since I am not a fan of duck, I got the pork sandwich.  The pork wasn't pulled but sliced thin which was excellent.  Lightly covered in tasty bbq sauce and topped with bacon and crispy fried onions...it was amazing!  I also got a side of duck fat fries which were super flavorful.  the fries were thin and my batch they were short so i must have gotten the end of the pile. My friends fries were a bit longer.  Regardless they were delicious.  My friends said their duck sandwiches were really good but not as good as they once remembered.  Either nothing is as good as your first or the sandwich was different from what they had.  If you are looking for a super casual, low key, bar food type of meal then this place is great.  I only rated it 3 stars bc compared to the other restaurants in Charleston there are better options."}, {"review_id": "GJjernSd8VkBafC5YHsMEQ", "user_id": "RGaMvTOueGY9Hk5Wv9fK2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "I originally learned about the Tattooed Moose from one of my favorite TV Shows...Diners, Drive Ins and Dives! You can always trust Guy Fieri and his recommendations. He nailed this one on the head. My husband and I decided to split the Thanksgiving Sammy. We love the concept of Thanksgiving on a Sandwich. The flavors were so spot on between the turkey, cornbread stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo. Easily, this is one of my favorite sandwiches. With the sandwich being as full as it was with ingredients, we didn't feel the need to get our own which is why we decided to split it. We also split the Duck Fat Fries...wow. We crushed our fries! They were so good. Initially, my husband was hesitate because he didn't like the idea of duck fat. I kept reminding him its just flavoring, mind over matter here. I'm glad he did!

OVERRATED... cha. cha. cha cha cha.  I heard great things about this Moose running around with a Tattoo... Try the Gyro they said... Try The Duck Fries the said... I came, I tried, I was underwhelmed. The Gyro. A little over seasoned which is disappointing because the Tzatziki sauce seems REALLY good and freshly made, not just out of a bottle. But as good as the meat tasted, it was relatively dry like any old gyro shop. Not nice and juicy like that of Charleston Deli. Also for $10, the gyro is relatively small. We Did the duck fries and they werent all that spectacular, or at least lived up to the hype. They are fresh, shoestring fries with a a nice sauce, but it isn't life changing.Service was hit and miss, because there was only two people working. The bartender and another server. Both were really pleasant, but it is hard to be attendant when you seem short staffed. Even some patio folks had to come in and find a server. For my first trip here it was ok, but I wont be in a rush to return.

I can't speak to the sandwich because I have not tried it yet. This establishment is literally right across the street from my office so I have eaten there a half dozen times. First you have to understand that this is an unpretentious dive bar atmosphere, however, the food is really good and atypical to dive bar fare. My absolute favorite sandwich is the Luck #1 Sub, try it, you will love it. I've had the Lowcountry Cuban but having lived in Tampa, FL for quite a while, it doesn't compare to the authentic Cuban sandwiches. That being said, it is still a really tasty sandwich. The Moroccan Gyro.........not a favorite of mine. I'm not sure what is going on there but for me it does not work well. My wife loves the different craft beers and is completely addicted to the \"duck fat\" fries! The fries are very tasty but I prefer thicker fries. all in all, this is definitely a place you want to visit.

This place is for sure a Dive bar for all the hipsters in town. Originally came here for the burger, since it was decently priced, but instead I got the Cuban sandwich because I just have to try one anywhere I go. It was phenomenal! Blew my mind, the sweet pickle and pickled green tomato definitely set it off. We also ordered the duck fat fries served with bleu cheese and roasted garlic. Hands down top 3 fries I've ever eaten! The place had a good selection of beers, I got a cream ale which the bartender suggested. The food came out fairly quickly, or we were just having too much fun on the two pinball machines available.

I've heard this place serves duck confit, and when I researched this place, I absolutely had to try this place.

The club is a la cartè, and a side of fries cost $2.50. The fries are not regular; the fries are fried in duck fat with a side of garlic aioli. I also got a bowl of gravy for $1. The sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've ever put into my mouth. The fries were too fatty/greasy, and the garlic aioli complemented the fries really well!
