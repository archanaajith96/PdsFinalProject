Set in an uber cool two story space, Datz delivers delicious casual food to a diverse clientele. It can be a family place, a quick stop for lunch or a gastropub for those looking to enjoy a cocktail and some really good grub! We were looking for a place before heading to the airport. I enjoyed an iced latte. I asked for a half shot of vanilla syrup and the chatty and overly accommodating server just brought me a side shot so I could customize the sweetness. She obliged my husband in tasting a few beers before he settled on one. He snacked on the half priced crispy buffalo cauliflower bites. I enjoyed a mile high cob salad. Delicious and exactly what I was looking for. Hubby had the Thai one on shrimp Asian style salad. Not heavy, balanced and gigantic portion size. Their dessert case is so whimsical. Oversized cakes, brownies and artisan chocolates by a local chocolatier. We made our way to Dough next door for a buckeye and gourmet donut. Our server suggested it. Datz gets a lot of their baked goods from there. Don't miss this spot. It has something for everyone and service that is beyond friendly. Well done Datz. Wish we had one in NJ."}, {"review_id": "0JpAJW9KlM7c9WGBX_GSEQ", "user_id": "a4m4ZwQu_0zsJhTrAHBsdA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "This place is really, really good. Like, anytime I come near Tampa in my travels I come here. It's somewhat of a legend around the central Florida area, as you can tell by the 2000+ reviews of this place. And it STILL has four stars. Wonderful. I came here with a couple of people on my way back to Orlando from Bradenton and we decided to stop in for a nice dinner. The decor inside the place is wonderfully Datz. Eclectic Americana all over the walls and wine bottle chandeliers on the ceiling. You'll be looking around your whole trip finding new things. The server was very prompt and very friendly as she handed us our newspaper menus; so kool. We also got complimentary popcorn for the table for some reason. It was good, so we didn't complain. We got two apps for the table: the Yum Yum Wings (A pound of crispy Korean bbq chicken wings, peanuts and Asian pineapple-chili sauce) and the highly recommended Datchos (House-made sweet-n-salty chips, chili, cheese, jalapeño, sour cream, blue cheese drizzle and scallions [add pulled pork for $4 extra]). The wings were classic Asian wings that are super sticky, super crispy on the outside, and moist and delicious on the inside. The pineapple-y BBQ was nice and sweet and the crunch from the peanuts was welcome for texture. The clear winner, though, were the Datchos. The chips were thin and crispy and the sweet element to them was interesting, making them almost sweet potato-like. Everything else was classic nacho stuff, and adding the pork added a good heft to the app that let us take some of our entrees home. As for the entrees. I got the chicken and waffles that I can't seem to find on the menu right now and my girlfriend got the legendary The Cheesy Todd (100% fresh ground chuck, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion and pickle. Served on two bacon-jalapeño mac n' cheese \"buns\").My chicken and waffles were pretty standard. The chicken tenders were cooked well with a good crispy exterior and the waffle was also crisp on the outside and light and fluffy and chewy on the inside. It was very solid, but it was also something I could get somewhere else. I wish I had gotten something else. Side note: try their hot sauce on the table with this. It's good. My girlfriend's Todd, on the other hand, was absolutely fantastic. If you haven't had this thing, you need to experience it. The burger patty itself was cooked a perfect medium and was salt 'n' peppered to perfection. The bun was very well formed and very warm, but, as soon as you pick up the whole thing and take that first bite, expect this thing to start falling apart. You're going to have to eat the rest of this with a knife and fork. But that's ok, because it's great. I highly recommend it myself. We skipped dessert, because we were stuffed. But the meal was awesome. I will continue to return here time and time again. On a side note, if you check into Yelp, you get a pretty fun little reward you can use immediately with your meal. Trust me."}, {"review_id": "c1yLmVu5fM3125WAqG7hZw", "user_id": "q5iz5euFdokOYHpN9njz_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I've loved Datz since the day they opened - seriously have been going there that long.

Every time I am in the area they are sold out, so you would think that would tell you it is pretty amazing!I'll be honest that at first I thought it was kind of weird looking LOL. It looks almost like a birthday cake with that cheap Walmart frosting on it! However, the cake itself is phenomenal! The frosting was a buttercream but it seems like it has a lot to dye in the mix (I'm assuming that gives it that neon orange color.) I wish they would just leave the frosting it's natural color because I feel like the dye takes away from the taste a little bit.On the other hand, the cake it's self is the bomb.com! It was moist (y'all know you love that word) and chunky with all sorts of delicious goodness! The flavor profile is one of the best I've had. I would recommend letting it sit at room temperature for a while and then enjoy... It was nearly perfect!From the carrot cake aficionado, I highly recommend it!

From the daring Vandross burger to the traditional-with-twist chicken and waffles or the surprisingly delicious blue cheese drizzle on top of the potato chips, Datz will certainly entertain your taste buds. I also really liked this place for brunch. They served big portions and intriguing brunch food.The space is very quirky with indoor and upstairs dining areas, decorated in a steampunk, meets Victorian, meets industrial chic, with wood and metal designs. It was also pretty clean with very nice staff. For being a very popular restaurant, it's still pretty easy to get in there unless it's summer and you're trying to go for brunch. Thankfully, they have offered ways of reserving tables online or by phone."}, {"review_id": "ZQpndIgy_z15VFWAa4FFpg", "user_id": "NefwsP1orGbfoqbOYsIcsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "What an exorbitant dining experience. Not in the sense of money or looks, but the loaded menu of options. This place has the most extensive drink menu of anywhere I've been, and an equally full food menu, enticing enough to make you want to order multiple meals. I love the liberal vibe, the over-the-top culinary concoctions, and the abundant portion sizes. Datz feels very \"American\", and is the type of restaurant that represents what foreigners think of our country's cuisine, being huge unhealthy crazy meals.  I have no shame in partaking in this from time to time, and Datz satisfies that desire perfectly.For an appetizer I had the mac-n-cheese bites, which were fried mac-n-cheese balls, with a spicy chipotle sauce. This was EXCELLENT! Could've and should've ordered 2. I failed on my main meal choosing, just because I got so flustered on what to pick from that huge menu, so I ended up with something basic like chicken tacos. Really wasn't my premier choice, I was just rushing as I was with a group. The menu really left me indecisive, which I can get when I have too many options. The tacos were ehh, but when I go back I know I need to order something more unique. They have way too many options not to. They own the nextdoor bakery, which specializes in donuts and ice cream. There's also a dessert counter in the restaurant, which the bakery provides the goods for. This too is very \"American\" and the cake and cupcake slices are ENORMOUS. We got the violet cupcake, which was literally violet in color (cake and icing), and had pomegranate and blueberry flavor. I wasn't a fan, because the icing was pretty bitter. Seemed that they focused more on appearance than taste here. But again, there are so many other options that it warrants several trips and you're bound to find something to your liking.Great restaurant. Worth a trip to every time in Tampa."}, {"review_id": "2USOorMj2LR_OExZ6s1u0A", "user_id": "aqQpcF5f0NVmBn6secrdGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Now Datz a great place. If you are considering going to Datz, please stop with the thinking, get in your car, and drive all the way down, you will not regret it. The only caveat is parking, get there early because otherwise you will be driving around in circles for a while. TIP: 11:30 or 3:00 are awkward enough times that you can easily find parking.The place is absolutely stunning in a rugged local kind of way, with wine bottle chandeliers and a full bar. There are so many drinks, and for those of you on a team lunch like I was, there is a wide selection of mocktails. They do have vegetarian options, the brie sandwich was delicious. I don't recommend the tuna tar tat because although beautifully stuffed inside a lettuce I felt it lacked tuna. If you're there with another person y'all should do a little switcheroo: one of you orders the pork sandwich, the other orders the fried chicken sandwich and y'all can exchange one half of the sandwich for the other.

There's very limited parking out front, but there's additional parking out in a separate little lot in the back for Datz customers. This place is always busy, but if you don't feel like waiting, there are two bars that you can walk up to and grab a seat to eat. Their menu is adorable, it's printed on a little old newspaper and it's incredibly cheeky and fun. There is a ton of food to choose from here so there's definitely something for everyone, but truly at the heart of this place, is comfort food. Like the kind of food that can save your soul after not having slept and you worked around the clock all week changing time zones multiple times kind of wonderful. It's honestly hard to just choose one entree, but honestly, their portions here are insane so come with an appetite. I've tried the porkfection, the short rib bowl, the apple butter jeans boots with the fig drink, the fusion fries, and the ebersons manhattan drink here and they are all absolutely fabulous. Honestly, my only regret is that I couldn't try to eat everything in one sitting.They have plenty of gorgeous desserts here too, but you can always go next door and check out their little bakery as well (they have ice cream there). But, if you'd rather save the steps, you can always order their dessert in-house as well and they have a little dessert cake counter in the middle of their restaurant as well. Datz is a solid place and I've never had a bad experience here. Their customer service is solid and their menu items for dinner/brunch/libations are delightfully creative... and their desserts are too almost too pretty to eat.

So I asked what the vegetables were and she said she would check and if it was pickles she would come back and let me know. She walked by a few minutes later and said we were good, it didn't come with picklesMy boyfriend ordered the cheesy Todd burger... It was something crazy, a hamburger but the buns were 2 deep-fried Mac n cheese patties.  He LOVED it.My sandwich came out and was covered. In...pickles. I told the guy who delivered it before he walked away and he grabbed it and said he would get them working on a new one.  I didn't have a chance to say anything else but I know most places well just pick the offending item off and send it back out to you, so I wanted to get something else entirely. Luckily the waitress came back right away to apologize and I asked if I could just get the tacos instead. She said sure.So I be ended up having to wait quite a long time for my tacos but they ended up comping my 2 drinks for the mishap so I was a happy girl.The beyond meat tacos were yummy, I he would just suggest maybe they add a bit of taco seasoning to them instead of just serving a crumble Patty.This place was super fun and had a lot of great options.
