However, let's get right to it...+ $9.99 buffet.  Oh shit..they got these potatoes, greasy, but it's so good that I don't even care.  Let's be real, people that eat healthy also have a 100% death rate. Eat up. + pancakes...ginormous and fluffy+ the coffee. This shit is brewed to perfection. + the staff is super friendly, patient with kids, and you know what, they're just great people.  This is a legit mom and pop restaurant that loves what they do and the food is solid. I will return here."}, {"review_id": "Pc2Obu3g-N808rcxTybZRw", "user_id": "ApUP3rYDHW5L_z_Hq4nRZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "It's a DIVE type restaurant! Quaint, friendly, family feel type spot. We came on a Sunday morning for breakfast. I chose this spot off the recommendation of my Yelp friend Teri W. It's a seat yourself, help yourself to the buffet type deal. The owner Mr Oliver literally said \"have a seat anywhere you want\" when we walked in. This is a neighborhood restaurant in a shopping center, they cater to regulars. Mr Oliver and Kim our server seemed to know a lot of the visitors on a first name basis.I even noticed one gentleman walked in and sat down to a plate that was brought to him immediately. Talk about knowing your clients! Wow!!!Well, the Mrs and I passed on the buffet, (I have a buffet phobia) we ordered off the menu, and let me tell you... if you ever visit this restaurant YOU MUST ORDER THE SWEET POTATO PANCAKES! OMG, they are the BOMB! Full disclosure, they give you a stack of three! I could only eat two and I'm a big guy. I had hash browns and sausage links and two eggs. I enjoyed my breakfast. The Mrs had Pig in the blanket, she said they could have just given her one pancake and she would have been good. You will definitely enjoy your experience here and because I love breakfast, I will most likely revisit this spot."}, {"review_id": "_RFDVES45o5c_8nx7jF7Gg", "user_id": "hWDybu_KvYLSdEFzGrniTw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Weekend breakfast was excellent and I strongly recommend the sweet potato pancakes and get them without the sugar. Seriously, that much powdered dust does nothing to help these perfectly cooked cakes of deliciousness. Moist, perfect with syrup and delicious.Service at D'cracked Egg was great with a warm greeting and a helpful waitress. It's not terribly fancy but this is breakfast. You don't need fancy for breakfast.In addition to the set menu, there's a breakfast buffet on the weekends. Eggs cooked to order plus an assortment of breakfast meats (ham, sausages, bacon, etc.) with biscuits, gravy and whatnot. It looked like a great spread."}, {"review_id": "D6cph3QUW1u9oDRdiyB3FA", "user_id": "8q5yP1VWPwGZwKagTf1vzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Best authentic southern breakfast. This place has the vibe of a diner but the food is cooked with love. All the southern favorites are here. The buffet is a wonderful deal. For 9.99 you get fresh eggs made to order, potatoes, grits, French toast, bacon, sausage, beef sausage, fried apples, biscuits and gravy, and all star hash. I opted for the steak and eggs. The ribeye was tiny and impossible to cook med rare but everything else was fantastic especially the biscuits. The service was top notch as well. My server was professional and polite and showed southern hospitality. The owner adds to the experience. He's the older AFRICAN American man standing near the door welcoming everyone as they walk in the door with a heart greeting and a smile and going out of his way to ensure customers are taken care of. I plan to patronize his establishment as often as I can!"}, {"review_id": "wVhyM8NwM5OkYqjHlVZLZQ", "user_id": "COi08bVv8BqHDudn4qtvQw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "It was alright nothing special or fancy mom and pop type feel. Homemade kind of food, very filling. Buffet on saturdays and sundays they said. Orange juice I thought was the funniest cause I think it was only sunny D for $3.29. I feel like we did get over charged, but I'm not certain; two combos and one juice came out to $27.

My aunt, grandma and I walked in on a early Sunday afternoon and the place wasn't really too crowded, but I noticed that only one table had their food. A family in the corner was breathing with frustration and left. I tried to hail down 1 of the 2 waiters just to get a menu and was ignored. I was about to get up and leave, but a woman finally came up and asked if we had been helped and when I told her no, she got us menus and took our orders.My grandma and aunt ordered the corned beef hash combo and I got the Breakfast Combo and subbed Hashbrowns for grits. The food was fantastic and came out quickly after ordering.  The biscuits are light and airy with a crunch. It appears that they are cooked in a square pan then cut open and placed on the flat top. I ate both of them. Upon leaving, someone who appeared to be the owner came in and the whole vibe of the place changed...in a good way. Waiters moved quicker and had a friendlier demeanor; He should be in there more often. Despite the service I will still come back, maybe things have changed."}, {"review_id": "CpJtMsSfBJHTcEH4lDFO8g", "user_id": "zN9lbORvHdbWrJ0_SfkNCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Amazing amazing amazing!!!!

It was clean, including the restroom. We decided on the buffet (potatoes, bacon, sausage, grits, French toast, grilled biscuits, etc) which was $9.99 and came with fresh cooked eggs included. I liked that vs the gross eggs served on most buffets. I'm sure on a normal day the service would've been mush better, but they got a party of 50+ for a family reunion. There was only one waiter and the owner/manager. So we were asked to move from where we were seated to accommodate this large party being seated together. That was okay, but of course it's not optimal. Fortunately we were just starting to place our order. We opted for the buffet because we thought we'd be waiting with such a large party coming in. If I come back here I might try something off the menu instead of the buffet."}, {"review_id": "BLNoBrHDdgRGYIviF6HqQA", "user_id": "z-b474BH8Kx4ud8obIyBxA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "I hate leaving bad reviews, but I felt completely misled by the extremely high rating of this place and I feel like I have to speak up.We actually came to this place by accident as my friend confused the name of somewhere else she had been. However the place was literally empty and since there were 7 of us, we thought it would be better to just eat here rather than deal with a wait somewhere else. The meal started off well enough; one of the staff members had already set up a table for us as we were gathering outside and he promptly came to take our drink orders. He had a very friendly familial tone that he spoke to us with which I liked. However it immediately became apparent that he was not hired for his professionalism. He proceeded to forget who had ordered coffee vs who hadn't to the point where we literally were raising our hands to be counted off (like I said it was a large party but it wasn't THAT large). Another guy brought all of the drinks but BURNED my friend setting it down on the table. Then when we our food started coming out we noticed a couple waffles missing. The second man (I honestly didn't get who was actually our server) asked me if I even ordered a waffle the first time and I proceeded to tell him ALL I'd ordered was a waffle. And to top it off the food wasn't really that amazing. My waffle was mushy and not at all how a waffle should be and I didn't hear many rave reviews from my friends either.

He escorted me to my table and gave me a menu. I placed my order (chicken cheesesteak with no peppers) and ordered a large orange juice. The orange was nothing to brag about, and my chicken cheesesteak was definitely something to be mad about. It was small, kids meal small. It was brought to me on a plate cut in half and with plain chips that looked like they were poured from a big bag. I wasn't even asked what kind of chips I wanted nor did I receive my dill pickle as stated on the menu. As I was eating the older man asked me if I'd like a couple of napkins, I said yes. He brought back two 1 ply kiddie napkins, let me also state that the silverware was also wrapped in the same napkins. The staff seem friendly but somewhat bored as they kept walking from the back to the kitchen/grill area. The space is a decent size with a good amount of tables but I was the the only person in there on a Saturday afternoon at 1pm. Also they have an all day breakfast buffet as the older man instructed a staff member to start breaking down the buffet for storage. I see that the place has high reviews but personally I wouldn't recommend this place nor would I want to come back."}, {"review_id": "f-gn_IBWBbsezBhk9B4WHg", "user_id": "guy9RAb7YxQxZshhe7eBuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "This place is SO good...came here on a whim while in town, and so glad I did.
