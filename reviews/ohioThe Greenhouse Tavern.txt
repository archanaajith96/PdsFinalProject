My husband and I came in for a date night / early birthday dinner. We used our wonderful resource (server) Alice to guide us through the menu. She did a lovely job pairing our tastes with menu favorites. We started with the brussels and chicken wings. We can't stop thinking / talking / dreaming about the brussels sprouts... I mean... Not to downplay the wings because dang. For our entree, we split the short ribs which was plentiful enough for 2, especially with a side of frites. Oh wait! I forgot to mention... my Old Fashioned was done 100% right... like definitely one of the best I've had. We had the pistachio dessert as well as the pot de creme. You can't go wrong with either but get the pot de creme, trust me. If we weren't relocating out of Cleveland, this would be our go-to for all of our \"special\" nights out. Hey Alice, you're amazing!"}, {"review_id": "4z1Ke-Zy4ROAgAtO_JbDPg", "user_id": "7C0NI9a_YP6PrNe4JSzZ0g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Location, location, location! Great atmosphere, cozy and trendy.  Drinks were great and chicken wing appetizer was very tasty, tender and big enough to share.  Burger was dry overdone and charred. Fries were sitting in a stainless tray of some sort under a heat lamp anxiously awaiting to be served to us.  They were soggy, somewhat warm and had a nice sprig of rosemary on top.  The pig in a pie or something like that, was 2 overly done thick  dry pork chops, potato square was very crisp and apple pie.  The dish apparently was steeped altogether to get a broth for the bottom of my plate.  Problem was it was so reduced and concentrated that it was a salty burnt reduction that caused the whole plate to taste the same.  I'm sure that if chef was preparing these dishes it would be incredible.  Unfortunately that was not our case. 2 stars for potentially a great experience."}, {"review_id": "OpmbiNpWu3sGGRs_gEh1Qw", "user_id": "FgErZblCviykov87oDIk0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I've been to TGT a few times over the years for drinks and small plates, but was recommended their brunch recently and decided to give it a try. I was told their bloody Mary's were amazing and that the no name frites were definitely worth trying. We made a reservation, so when walking in and giving our name we were seat immediately, by a very friendly hostess. As soon as we took seats at our table water was poured and our server followed. She was super friendly, and answered all the questions we had. Luckily they were having waffle specials for national waffle day, and I was super pumped for the (wait for it) VEGAN WAFFLE OPTION!  Side note, it's probably been over 8 years since my last waffle due to my dairy intolerance and pure laziness to make a vegan one myself, so I knew instantly what I would be ordering. Also on their brunch menu they offer smaller portions of some regular dishes for kids, which was perfect since my daughter was part of brunch :) We ordered for her a single pancake, plain, and they were happy to oblige, also ordered her a side bacon.My husband ordered the no name frites, after debating between that and the chicken and waffles. The frites were recommended and seem to be a favorite in house. I ordered the vegan waffle, obvi, and I had to order the Bloody Mary. Drink was very quick to come and the food was also very quick. Wow! The vegan waffle was possibly one of the best things I've eaten in a while. There was apple, and some vanilla flavor to it. But I can't even describe how great it tasted. My daughter inhaled the bacon rather quickly and ate a good portion of a very healthy sized pancake. My husband was pleased with the frites, he said they were quite salty, which I think is to be expected when ordering such a dish. All in all I would absolutely head back to their brunch. And drink many many more bloody Mary's! Nice work Green House Tavern!"}, {"review_id": "7g_tM5qTBQwr8OY7pgjXZw", "user_id": "IZ08NiyIBv2bwF1BF4oDkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "How this place doesn't get 5 stars consistently is a mystery to me.  Had an amazing breakfast outdoors in the sun with outstanding service.  Food selection (Brunch in our case) was inventive and inspired and the quality and freshness of the ingredients was obvious.  We had a beef burger, veggie burger and hash dish.  Would be happy to eat every meal here if we could.  Tiffany was excellent as our waitress and everyone we interacted with was friendly, professional and skilled.  This is a great spot for interesting dishes and fair prices in an eclectic setting.  Don't miss this one.  There are a ton of choices in the immediate area, but only one other (B&B across the street) that deserves a visit every time you're in the area."}, {"review_id": "UPK5EqH4W-QYs4PBMKSM7w", "user_id": "CZzMTJ7nC7h4g_9iWnaaEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I absolutely cannot speak highly enough for this restaurant. Incredibly polite, friendly, and hard working staff, a creative and delicious menu, and just a very warm, comfortable atmosphere.

This place was awesome.  The pig head did not disappoint. The sauce really set it off. The meat feel from the bone. The drinks were pretty good too. They have some tasty coctails and beers. The place is a bit on the pricey side so just keep that in mind when visiting.  I knew it ahead of time and it did not bother me.  The service here was pretty good too. The place is pretty big inside, but you can easily pass it on the outside. It is on the main downtown Cleveland strip where all the restaurant/bars are located.  This is definitely a must visit if you are in Cleveland. And if you are not up for the pig head, i heard that the clams, and wings are pretty good too."}, {"review_id": "wlNBt9zm9iXH9kzzJnsTgA", "user_id": "SBCBN77jyknjAv6UK8WJKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "This place is all around excellent! Farm to plate really works well here. There was plenty to choose from for the meat eater in me, and the vegan/vegetarian in my girlfriend. Also, I'm not much of a cocktail drinker usually, but the fresh natural ingredients in their drinks were awesome!For appetizers we got the brussel sprouts, and the gravy fries. Both were good choices and I'd get them again.Lastly, the main event for me was the entree and the Pig's Head! It's the entire reason I came here, and I'm so glad I went for it. Think of the best pork ribs you've ever had, and the pig's head here beats them. Juicy, moist, so flavorful, about as close to melt in your mouth as you can get. The best pork entree I've ever had! So worth it, and if you're on the fence, go for it....you won't regret it.On a side note: Some weird negative reviews. Everyone has their own experience I guess, but some people just don't belong in a restaurant like this. Just sayin."}, {"review_id": "h4NJanuoaiPUvGKCIavEWA", "user_id": "LxEiyqAfHj9EZEwGix4lMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Anyone who give Greenhouse less than 5 stars is a dolt.

The food there is let's just say, out of the ordinary, but in a good way! The atmosphere is amazing, east 4th street is one of the best parts of downtown Cleveland. It's basically like a closed down street party. The restaurant itself is very trendy and the service is great. The frites are amazing! I took a huge chance and ordered the roasted pig head, and it was a food adventure to say the least. Pretty amazing to see, and more amazing to experience the taste. It was delicious. I have had other items on the menu, burgers are really good, and the salads are as well. Everything is creatively prepared to give your tastebuds a delight. A perfect place to go when the weather is warm outside. Very cool rooftop deck as well.

Overall atmosphere in here is laid back casual, my kind of place. Food is definitely original, everything was good in its own way, it lost a star because I left certain things are over seasoned and maybe gone a tad too far. We ordered fried pig ears as an appetizer, they were fantastic, crunchy, lots of flavor. Also we did the Brussel sprouts, easily the best I've ever had!My entree was the ground beer tartare, and WOW! It was fantastic, but with some of the sauces it started to lose me, I was hoping for one to just accent the beef and blow me away, unfortunately the tartare was best alone, there was no marriage between sauce choices and the protein, but the tartare was done so well it didn't need it! My side was frites with garlic and rosemary. This is where it got too much, the rosemary made no sense. It may just be my opinion but it was just so overwhelming with a bad taste, I wouldn't recommend these to anyone, it was 90% rosemary, 9% potato, 1% other.But overall we're up for greenhouse, I do love this place so far, I love the originality even if the taste isn't working for me in some areas.The final part of our greenhouse dining experience was dessert. For me, I saw pistachio ice cream and had to go for it. I've thought a lot about pistachio ice cream lately, watching a lot of cooking shows and watching them make ice cream, this is one I wanted to try. And you guys killed it, it was nutty and had some crunch in it, it tastes just like pistachio, it was fantastic. The cream with the wafers... comparable to the rosemary and frites, not a good flavor, to be honest, barley edible. There appears to be a ying and yang on every plate.Overall 4/5, easily a 5 if they tighten up recipes a bit and make them make more sense.Atmosphere 5/5- more laid back, casual, I like the themeTaste 4/5- just small things that make whole dishes feel offValue 3/5- I just don't think the quality of the menu items are there to be charging the prices they do, not quite at a Lola tier yet, sorry Sawyer.I feel like I'm being very critical of this place, considering I've given 5 stars to less but it's the expectation with the price tag and I just feel like it's not delivering. I'll definitely be back for part two and try that delmonico, maybe I'll be completely editing this review after that."}, {"review_id": "DGiHvNQNFl-9nGkwnQi5CA", "user_id": "6hKQshPuSZ7yO-qT06bTKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "If you are looking for unique menu options such as a pigs head stop by this restaurant on E4th.

Third thing: they no longer have a happy hour menu, although it is widely advertised on the website.  I had my heart set on several items and I was there at a weird hour, when there were physically about 5 other people total in the whole restaurant.  So that was mildly disappointing too.I liked what I did have: poutine (they don't call it that, but they were fries covered in gravy and cheese curds) and the wings, which were pretty flavorful.  Other times I've been here, I've been blown away.  So this is really less than a 4 with this last visit, but rounded it up, based on my previous visits of the stellar service and delectable food."}, {"review_id": "-LJ4JyzYZ580qL8zYz6oPA", "user_id": "Kf-r2tLcPi-XWQDYOBNQ8w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Fail!

No peas with it as mentioned in the menu, but instead one-sliced radish & 4 roasted asparagus, some greens & 5 of the chewiest gnocchi I've ever tasted. Good broth but for about $37 way overpriced.

I loved the atmosphere and the decor, and having read other reviews criticizing how close the tables were to each other, this didn't impact on our evening. In fact, we were able to strike up a lovely conversation with a couple who sat next to us. Upon reviewing the menu, our eyes were immediately attracted to the tasting menu. Our waitress went on to explain that the 6 courses were down to the chefs discretion and would highlight the house specialities. $110 per person with wine pairings. SOLD. The first 3 courses came to our table within 10 mins, and we had to ask the waitress to slow things down.... thankfully they did. The food was fine. The ramp rigatoni dish was superb. It just felt that no real thought had been put into the tasting menu. The wine pairings didn't really match up with the dishes, and the dishes really didn't seem to highlight the restaurants 'famous' items. I would definitely give this restaurant another go, but unless some serious work is done to improve the tasting menu, would stick to the main menu."}, {"review_id": "TU_l9E5asuvaA6uOj9DDxQ", "user_id": "LU322e1MdWbyi0xTlqc4xA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "My husband and I had brunch here. I was really pleased, husband gives it a so-so. Starting with drinks I ordered a cappuccino and a virgin Bloody Mary (give me ALL the drinks). I was pleased they could do the virgin for me because I was absolutely craving a bloody but had a long drive ahead of me after we ate. It was delicious, very spicy, a little salty, and had a strong olive taste. Cappuccino looked pretty, tasted decent enough. Nothing spectacular with that. For food I ordered pastrami hash - oh. my. god. The meat was sooo good. Parts of it were nice and crunchy like it was a good piece of bacon, other parts were fatty and stringy like a good hunk of corned beef. Instead of typical toast (white, rye), they grill a hunk of sourdough bread. Perfect to sop up your egg with. The hash was small diced potatoes, red onion, and red bell pepper. I loved his dish. Husband got the classic \"steak and eggs\" dish that also came with hash. He loved the hash, but did not like the quality of the steak, and did not appreciate the sourdough instead of regular toast. I guess this is a preference thing. Our server was really nice and did a good job. The price is a little steep because this is definitely a trendy spot, not like a small 24/7 breakfast diner. You pay for the ambiance of 4th street and whatnot. Would definitely recommend for a breakfast spot that is innovative and trendy."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greenhouse-tavern-cleveland-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
