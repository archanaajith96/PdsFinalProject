I'm always amazed at the sheer volume of menu options - it takes me forever to decide what to order! But you really can't go wrong. Breakfast is served all day, so I often find myself ordering from the breakfast menu. I love the breakfast burritos - especially the hash browns they tuck in there along with the side of salsa. And they're huge! So filling. The paninis are also delicious and come with your choice of a side (pasta salad, potato salad, apple). I'm a fan of anything that includes their housemade \"schug\" sauce - a spicy, herby Middle Eastern sauce that complements just about anything. I really enjoyed my Detox cold pressed juice (apple, beet, celery, cucumber, ginger, lemon), but be warned the juices cost as much as a sandwich.I've yet to try anything from the Mac n' Cheese menu, but it's only a matter of time. They look AMAZING. I've also been eyeing the Short Rib Grilled Cheese. Mmm. One of these days...Pressed is always *very* busy, but they do a decent job at churning out orders and are even quicker moving through the line to order. You can order ahead online as well, recommended for busy times. TL;DR Pressed rocks! Nothing bad to say about it. Tasty, hearty, nutritious."}, {"review_id": "B75avLEOGBtkcvqWBu7GkA", "user_id": "YfwhEMhBMd9FWJ6Tv8sv-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "Definitely 5 stars.The best espresso coffee in NH, delicious breakfast burritos and arguably your best option for lunch sandwiches.Very fast service, very \"vivid\" interior, friendly staff and reasonable prices.It can get really busy however the service can handle all the load.I can't wait for their new store to open in Manchester so I don't have to drive 20 miles to enjoy their coffee and sandwiches!"}, {"review_id": "HLeqzPz9XVZBefNaCzFiYg", "user_id": "3oj2Py8_VDDDVP5Imurb_A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "A decent find while traveling through Nashua. Ordered the smoked salmon on everything bagel and the breakfast burrito with a \"green monster\" muffin. The salmon was surprisingly fresh as were the ingredients in the burrito. The bagel was a tad over toasted and definitely not a \"NY bagel\".  The menu is large and has lots of healthy options. The muffin was my personal favorite item I ate and I'd recommend a side of the Mediterranean hot sauce. I'd probably go back if in the area because of the lack of quality restaurant choices. The place reminds me of a slightly better Panera bread which doesn't say a whole lot.  Not bad but nothing special."}, {"review_id": "UIq__KhtfoHAJ5CZGxplIw", "user_id": "qGLPQY0s3H4LxmoD5DDUng", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "In general: 4 starsThis time: 2.5 stars - I got the red quinoa protein bowl and holy cow, it was like a trough of slop. Very little of anything but the black bean sauce. I picked out the chicken, what I could find of avocado, the several corn kernels, and what I could dredge out of the spinach and basically left 2/3 lb of bean dip uneaten. Really disappointed for $10.50. My understanding is that the bowl should be equal portions of the dry ingredients with a drizzle of bean sauce, not black bean bisque topped with other things.

The food was alright, the employees were friendly, and there was plenty of indoor seating. This is one of my go-to restaurants for food in Nashua as they are really lacking a healthy food scene.My only issue? When the menu says cheddar cheese, I didn't assume it meant the nasty, square slices. Gross. I got my plate and there were two slices just slapped on top. I had to scrape it off.

The cafe is almost always packed. Don't plan on arriving at noon and snagging a table. The food is what I would classify as \"healthy eating.\" Visualize a \"sprouts and tofu\" restaurant in San Francisco and you will get the picture. For breakfast they have a dozen or so burritos with eggs plus everything healthy you can imagine. The cappuccino is quite good. Lunch consists of a wide range of paninis, salads, and soups. They also offer \"power bowls,\" mac and cheese and a Middle Eastern dish called Shakshuka. Overall the food is very good here. You can't go wrong with any dish. The counter is set up to handle a high volume of people with two registers. You place your order, pay for it and receive a tent card with a number you can place on your table. Your food and drinks are delivered to your table. The employees I met were very friendly and helpful. If there is a downside, it is more expensive than other places in Nashua with lunch costing between $10 and $20. Even with the cost, this place is worth it. I just wish they would add another one in north Nashua."}, {"review_id": "Jj1qUpD05mtTrl0BAuEbmg", "user_id": "pW9LvtC-hZ0PRAOUn7aZ2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "So many healthy menu options it will make your head spin!I finally made it to South Nashua to try Pressed Cafe.

I like the self serve complimentary water that have have out for health and hydration- a nice touch.Menu size is overwhelming and so much of it looks great it is hard to choose.
