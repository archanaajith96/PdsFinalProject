That's not to say it was bad, but it did not blow us away. But, there are some gaps that I will detail below. They become more glaring when compared to other fine dining experiences.  I think they need to shore up some aspects of the service and modernize others in order to deserve maintaining their Michelin status.That said, no regrets, & I can cross it off my list.   Details below.FOOD:The food was pretty average for a fine dining establishment.  Out of the 5 courses we got, 1 stood out as outstanding, 1 stood out as bad, and the rest were just about average.  Outside of that:1) The complimentary bread was flat out BAD - cold, sliced, with nothing special.  The butter didn't even spread easily.  As someone in my party said, \"The bread we use for our kids' sandwiches are better\"2) The complimentary soup - a tad too much on the sour/acidic side.  I understand the intent of opening with that, but the taste was not good.The 1 outstanding course was the Branzinni.  It was crisp and well balanced with the sauce and accompanying vegetables.  The 1 bad course was the risotto - grossly undercooked, under-seasoned, lacked proper balance relative to the proteins.  The duck, beef, and lobster were all just average.  Not bad, but didn't delight me either.This might be heretical to some (sorry!), but honestly, it was not that much better than a chain like Houstons or the joint down the street a bit (Hillstones). SERVICE:In many respects, they TECHNICALLY hit the mark.  Professionally dressed staff, offered to check in our coats on arrival, and even accommodated our request to get a table 30 minutes earlier.  That's where the positives end though.The issues we encountered from a service standpoint were:1) We all wore dark outfits - I would have expected to be offered a dark napkin, but instead we got white ones, and guess what? A bunch of lint got caught and was visible.2) As noted above, the bread was not great, but we were hungry and each of us finished off our first two slices pretty quickly.  The bread replacement process was where we were frankly taken aback at how abrupt and hurried...the attendant was just short of tossing the bread on our plates before quickly walking away!3) When taking our order, I've been accustomed to the \"ladies' first\" custom at a fine dining venue...and I mean ALL ladies.  The waiter did take the order from one woman in our party first, but the other lady (my wife) went last.  To exacerbate this, the waiter didn't even walk over to my wife's side and she literally would have to shout to overcome the noise level in the place.  Now my wife isn't shy so she shot the waiter a look and he quickly walked over to her, but seems like something he should have been trained to do.4) As dishes came out, some servers took a minute to explain the dish, what was in it, etc.  Some servers did NOT.  Other servers just quickly mumbled as if they were in a Guinness Book of World Records competition for world's fastest talker.5) At the end of the service, we were given breakfast cakes as a parting gift.  We asked for a bag and the waitress shot us this disgusted and incredulous look, and asked \"You need a bag for that?\"  First of all, YES, we wanted a bag, so just give us a damn bag and second, many other tables with parties of 2 or 4 had bags as well, with the cakes inside.  WTF?In short, the service was below expectations.ATMOSPHERE/AMBIANCE:The place was LOUD.  There was definitely one table where a lady was clearly tipsy and going off with some borderline inappropriate comments regarding how \"asian women tend to blah blah blah.\"  The staff probably should have stepped in and asked her to politely tone it down.  Thankfully her husband shushed her, but jeez.The place was crowded.  In my opinion, too many tables for the space and certainly too many tables for the staff to cover with a personal touch.  When the staff is literally walking a tightrope to maneuver the cheese cart and banana flambe cart in between tables, and asking folks near the dessert making process to be aware of flames - you have to just cut the number of tables.  To reinforce that observation, waiting for the bathroom interfered with the staff's routes from the kitchen to tables.I get having soft lighting for setting the mood, but there is a point where it's simply too dark!  When we walked in, it was already a tad too dark, but midway through our dinner, they dimmed the lights even more.VALUE:On the surface, $128 for 5 courses seems very reasonable, but that actually averages out to $25+ per course.  By comparison, another fine dining venue has 13 courses for $225 (was $185 a year ago),  which is $17+ per,  and was $14+ a year ago.  I can say the Food, Service, and Ambiance at this other venue is 5 stars across the board."}, {"review_id": "4G0PG2MtUM4MDeO8MaXUiA", "user_id": "dA2MtgPoBPl0WYwlAgZJdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Service: 5 Star Decor: 4.5 StarFood: 4 Star at best - sorry, my lobster did not taste fresh"}, {"review_id": "xMHEpQD3y-vq3PmDAzMIeQ", "user_id": "hOqGHyn63_S88qx_dhuLfw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Good food, great service, but way to decadent for ya girl.

The sauce. It was on the sweet side for me. The lamb itself was tender and cooked to medium rare perfection. Tried my friend's lobster, delicious. I can see why it came highly recommended. Had a bite of the Dungeness Crab Salad, meh, boring. The glazed oysters were a hit with all of us that ordered it. I took my dessert to-go. Loved how it didn't melt like crazy on me during my 15 minute car ride. They would've been perfect without the sauces. The sauces just made the dessert way too sweet.For a special occasion, this place is nice. Almost everything on the menu looked extremely appetizing.

Omg, if only I can give 0 star on yelp! My husband and I came here at 5:20pm on a Saturday to see if we can be seated at the bar. I'm 7 months pregnant so my husband told me to go in first while he valet. After I sat down, there was still 3 seats available at the bar. Of course, anything that can possibly go wrong goes wrong. Three ladies walked in and wanted to be seated at the bar. Two were friends and one came alone. The manager, Steven, came over to ask me if I'm waiting for someone and I told him yes, my husband is parking. He looked at me and said, \"there's no holding seats at the bar, it's first come first serve\" and turned to ask all three ladies to take a seat. He didn't care if my husband was just outside. My husband walked in right after they sat down. I understand this might be their policy but WTF? Seriously? It wasn't even like my husband was driving around looking for parking! HE WAS RIGHT OUTSIDE PAYING THE VALET!And tell me if I'm wrong. If I already told you I'm here with my husband and you seated all three ladies at the empty seats without consenting me, are you technically asking me to leave the restaurant? Or he really believe that I would just eat at the bar by myself while my husband stand next to me or sit in the car?  If he would even just say, \"I apologize for any inconvenience but if your husband does not show up in the next minute or two we will need you ask you to give up the seats?\" I would have been totally fine with it!This is UNACCEPTABLE for ANY restaurant and not to mention I believe they have 1 Michelin Star. This is not my first time at Gary Danko (but it is my first time at the bar) nor ANY fine dinning restaurants in the Bay Area and this is extremely disappointing. We tried not to let him ruined our night but you guys all know mood can change a person's appetite. And not to mention, our server witnessed the whole situation at the bar! Here's my question to you as a manager, how do you expect your team to serve us after you've caused an unpleasant scene? For those of you who's wondering why we didn't leave it's because we do not believe that we've done anything wrong. In fact we felt mistreated so we asked for our valet to be reimbursed before we head out. But only to be told that they are not the same company and that they have nothing to do with the valet. Then the gentleman already sitting at the bar was kind enough to tell us that he will be done with his drinks soon and that my husband can take his seat. So that's why we ended up staying for dinner."}, {"review_id": "dvJ19SkrbZXhNeB9M3G_sw", "user_id": "x8fZXFzsCERCcH7g5KkMWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Danko has been a fixture of Northern California cuisine scene for decades. He's featured as a stalwart for regional cooking in SF Bay Area, and has flourished longer than many others. Younger diners may be unaware of his history from working with Grand Dame Madeline Kamman in Napa to his pedigree with the Ritz Carleton SF as touted Dining Room chef. Although there are some slight nuances of innovation, his menu is in essence a solid greatest hits collection that diners can select from best sourced ingredients in CA. For sheer quality and value of service in the City for fine dining, it's really a special value that's incomparable. Where else can you get a 3 course fine dining meal under $100 without feeling ripped off?However, the service is also the high point. Staff is suited and professional in every way. When food is served, all hands are on deck dropping plates in unison. William delicately handled a 17 yo bottle Opus One Cab Sav my brother had hand-carried for 10k miles from his Osaka cellar with a crumbling cork with ease. I was watching him battle frustration, then filtered, decanted, and saved the est. $500 bottle of wine. Our Sommelier was equally attentive and knowledgeable with a recommendation of a Spotswood Sauvignon Blanc with ripe melon overtones bouquet, and subtle finish that was not overtly dry. Dishes were presented and described with accuracy and care of seasoning. The fact that our \"seven top\" ordered dinner, was served wine, then presented with beautiful first course appetizers within 20 minutes without feeling hurried was amazing. You can tell that it's a pretty tight team in the kitchen. Mains and desserts are served with austere beauty and the flourish with tiny petit fours mignardise complete the meal. The last touch...We were probably the last table out and every service member stopped to say goodnight. The small elegantly wrapped breakfast cream cheese pineapple cake was highly coveted the next morning and a thoughtful extension of a great meal.It's a place where folks can enjoy a real meal, drink and converse in a subtle quality setting."}, {"review_id": "lvm0g7LNcXc7F0i73kktvQ", "user_id": "mQCAQdPeGTGhHRGmBmsdHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Finally came for an overdue visit to Gary Danko's.  It seems almost impossible to get an opentable reservation at a decent time here so I decided to show up at 5 pm on a Sunday as a walk-in.  I immediately got seated at the bar where they also served the full (3, 4 or 5 item prix fixe) or tasting menu.  The food here is solid and French - great ingredients transformed into dishes that are perfectly executed. I chose 5 items - surf (oysters with caviar, branzini), turf (seared foie, filet of beef) and the perfect dessert (lemon soufflé cake) with mignardises.  At the end of the meal, they gave me a small cake to take home.  I really appreciate the variety and number of items in their menu (I'm a little tired of set tasting menus at the moment).  I also like that this restaurant gives you a lot of bread (yes - I used it to soak up lots of the sauces).Tom, the bartender, was the perfect host for my meal. He did a fantastic and fun job making non-alcoholic pairings for me.  Hospitality was excellent. As for the ambiance, it's very old San Francisco (probably time for a remodel and the place is a bit dark) and feels very dated when compared to the other Michelin-starred restaurants in SF. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for fine dining who is visiting Fisherman's Wharf.  The attire is business casual (dark jeans ok) but I saw a really good range of clothing when I visited, particularly from tourists who look like they just finished a whole day of sight-seeing in SF.  I look forward to my next visit to try the other items on the enormous menu."}, {"review_id": "YdIgeOcf-beYMND3Mb_RbQ", "user_id": "i4c3oBsWZNIrrmL9oWGguA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "SUPERIOR EXPERIENCE!

Dinner work like this: you get to choose 3 courses for 89, 4 courses for 109, and 5 for 128. You can mix and match any number of apps, main courses, and desserts that you want. 5 course meal of 5 main plates? No problem. 3 course meal of all the same app? You can do that too. The menu comes with 5 sections. Apps, fish and seafood, meats and game birds, cheese , and dessert.We orderedApps 1. Glazed oysters and caviar. 2. Dungeness crab salad with avocado over a bed of quinoa.Seafood. 3. Branzini with fennel puree. 4. Seared scallops and lentils.Meats. 5. Lemon pepper duck breast. 6. Roasted stuffed quail with mushrooms and foie gras.7. Cheese board.8. Trio of creme brulee.We were more than stuffed at the end.1. The glazed oyster dish comes with 4 oysters over a bed of Ossetra caviar. While the oysters were OK in this leek ceam sauce, the caviar tasted amazing. Light, rich, and just melts in your mouth. I would order this dish again for the caviar in the leek sauce alone. 4/5.2. Dungeness crab salad. While I wasnt overly impressed by the oysters, this salad was the whole package. Instead of fine chopping crab into small chunks that you might see in other salads, here you have 2 large pieces of crab over 2 pieces of grapefruit and avocado. What a combination that was. I think my new favorite way of eating crab now with grapefruit! The quinoa was OK as was the vinaigrette. They gave a bit too mich quinoa...but hey, when is too much a bad thing? =p 4/5.3. Branzini is our favorite white fish so this one was an easy selection for us. Oh and the saffron orange emulsion mixed with fennel puree? Yea it was that good. She doesn't like olives and Im not a huge fan either, but the ones in this dish were not as sour or sharp as other olives I had. 5/5.4. Scallops happen to be one of my favorite things to eat and Gary Danko does not disappoint. Two large perfectly seared scallops  with potatoes, roasted peppers and a light curry vinaigrette makes this an easy 5/5. Everything just works in this dish.5. The duck breast came with duck hash, poached pears, and a delicious garlic puree. While every individual compnent was excellent individually, I wasn't sure exactly how to tackle this dish. Too many complex tastes here! Still the generous portion size is tough to beat 5/5.6. The roasted quail with stuffed mushroom and foie gras really hit the spot. The resturant keeps you filled with sourdough bread and what better way to eat the soft bread than with a spread of foie gras? Oh yea, the pumpkin orzo, truffle corn bread, and glazed apple were nice, too lol. What a dish. 5+/5.7. Here I have to apologize. Im not a cheese person and good cheese is wasted on me. =(((. 8. So the trio of creme brulee ended up being quite filling. Vanilla, ginger,  and burbon. Highly recommend! Overall, 5/5.

I agonized over this and spent much more time than I should of thinking about this. I like lists/rankings (as those of you who follow me know) ...since they make decisions easier for me...so I turned this decision making process into the Research Project I dubbed  \"Gary Danko number of times someone indicated this was their favorite dish\" game. I did a very very (did I say very) un-scientific ranking based on going over a ton of Yelp reviews of friends/well written reviews. I didn't do a spreadsheet but I tried to list them based on how frequent I felt they were mentioned. Typically I do this rough calculcation/analysis in my head but I wanted to get it down on paper because there were so many darn dishes to choose from. Rank below is based on the # of instances I believed people mentioned the dish as their favorite dish. Risotto seemed to be winner...on down.1)Risotto 2) Pan Seared Scallops 3)Roasted Quail 4)Lemon Pepper Duck Breast 5)Roast Maine Lobster 6)Coconut Thai Curry 7) Foie Gras8)Cheese Plate 9) Roasted Pork Tenderloin and Belly 9) Loin of Lamb10)Sea Bass  So knowing that and knowing I had a hot date (my wife). I went with the decision making process below. This would achieve my primary goal of getting to try as many dishes as possible.  Step 1  (Create List Ranking)  aboveStep 2: I then asked the wifey to let me know what she was ordering. Key step ...happy wife = happy life.Step 3 : She listed Risotto, Seared Beef, Dungeness Crab SaladStep 4:  I requested that she bump up 5 courses so we could taste more things. It helped that I was treating : o PStep 5: So basically I eliminated  Risotto from my rankings. She also picked two dishes that were not on my list (Seared Beef and Dungeness Crab Salad) darn! But hey see above..happy wife= happy life.Step 6: We still had 7 courses to play with so we went straight down the list . I added Sea Bass only b/c I love Seabass.So after that initial selection here is how I felt the dishes were (re-ranked for your viewing pleasure) from fave  to least fave. I also put in parentheses what I perceived to be their rank before dinner.Rod's Gary Danko Dish Rankings:#1 Fave--Pan Seared Scallops (2)-- so soft and tasty great sauce  Cannellini Bean Puree.  Best scallops I've had2-- Foie Gras (7) --Soft like butter Carmelized Onions and Apples bring a great dynamic.3--Pan Seared Sea Bass (11) - The Clam Succotash  , sweet potato puree  and shallots the seabass sits on top of were also super tasty. 4-- Coconut Thai Curry (6) - Nice Presentation. The waitress bring  sauce in a mini pot and pours the sauce over the Candied Peanuts and Shitake Mushrooms. The Curry sauce is a seafood medley of Shrimp, Calamari, Lobster and Scallops that taste delicious5-- Risotto (1)Everything goes well together and almost tastes like a fancier Filipino Dish Arroz Caldo. This where my \"must order for next time line is\" ..................6-- Roasted Quail (3) - This is more about the things that are stuffed ( Mushroom Ragout, Leeks, quinoa and Foie Gras with Fingerling Potatoes and Porcini Cream) than it is about the actual Quail. I mean this was good but not amazing to me. 7-- Dungeness Crab Salad ( NR) Another nice presentation and taste combo with Melons, Cucumbers, Roasted Eggplant and Thai Mango dressing. Wifey insisted that she had a \"light salad\" so that's how this made it as a selection. Once again see above...happy wife= happy life.  8-- Roast Maine Lobster (5) - good ,savory but clearly behind scallops n sea bass in my eyes in the \"seafood category\" 9-- Lemon Pepper Duck Breast(4)  Bacon Braised Endive and Cardamom Poached pears were an interesting combo. I thought the dish was decent but not very flavorful as other dishes and would not order again.#10 least fave but still o.k.-- Seared Beef (NR) last  Gnocchi was tasty and the Swiss Char and Stilton Butter are nice touches but just was not a fan of this dish. Would not order again....................................After Dinner:I requested a Lyft  and when it came nearThe license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirrorAfter five courses you may have thought this night was done But I thought \"Nah, forget it, yo holmes, to San Tung!\""}, {"review_id": "ZdqYGR1zahJmBFENFufP9w", "user_id": "jDpQ39IPBRMNZobYVF2otQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "I see there are a lot of long detailed reviews of Gary Danko, I'm going to keep mine short and sweet.

Loved it! I've been wanting to come here for awhile now and I finally went.My boyfriend and I had a reservation on a Friday night at 6:00pm. Luckily, we were able to find a parking spot right across Ghirardelli Square which is about a 1-2 minute walk to the restaurant. If you're not able to find parking, this restaurant does valet for $20. We arrived 5 minutes early for our reservation but got seated right away. Service is on point here! They don't rush you to order, they constantly refill your water without having to ask, refill bread on your plate once you run out, and change your utensils each time a new course comes out (even if you didn't use the utensils). The meals are set from 3 courses ($89), 4 courses ($109) or 5 courses ($128). The food is set by \"Appetizers\", \"Fish and Seafood\", \"Meat and Game Birds\", \"Cheese\", and \"Dessert\". You can choose the food you want from any section. They start you off with a soup before your courses. My boyfriend and I went with the 3 courses.The food we got were:Appetizers:- Seared Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions and Apples- Risotto with Rock Shrimp, Dungeness Crab, Root Vegetables, Sage and Beech MushroomsFish and Seafood:- Seared Sea Scallops with Lentils, Roasted Peppers, Potatoes, Parsley and Madras Curry Vinaigrette Meats and Game Birds:- Seared Filet of Beef with Potato Gnocchi, Olive Oil, Swiss Chard and Stilton Butter- Herb Crusted Loin of Lamb with Farrotto, Medjool Dates, Rainbow Carrots and Green ChermoulaDessert:- Baked Chocolate Soufflé with Two SaucesWe enjoyed every bite of our food! The food was cooked perfectly and had nice presentations to them. After we finished our food, they gave us a plate of little yummy treats. Since it was my birthday, they also gave a complimentary dessert. I think it was lemon cake, not too sure but it was good! After that, we got another complimentary thing which was banana cream cheese bread to eat for breakfast.Everything was great, we will definitely be back! Try this place out if you haven't yet.

Me and my bf did the 5 course meal, cause we were thinking if this place is super expensive and we don't get to go here often, why not go all out and try everything. Most people would probably do fine with the 4 courses, as me and my bf were both really full by the end and we do eat a lot. Before I forget valet parking is $20 but you can definitely find street parking nearby (although it may be a limit of 2 hours) In terms of menu items: Seared foie gras with carmelized onions and apples - 10/10!!!!omg this was the tastiest thing I have ever eaten in my life. the foie gras was super delectable and soft and filled with lots of flavor. It was small, but it was definitely one of my top choices after trying the other things I picked Risotto with rock shrimp - 6.5/10 I'm not sure if I'm a fan of risotto, I may not be as I thought this was a little salty. My bf however thought it was really really good! Seared scallops - 10/10!!These scallops tasted so good and was super soft with every bite. I felt like I was eating a meal from hells kitchen LOL. There was also this thing in the middle that I couldn't tell what it was, some sort of potato cake? It was super good too. I couldn't exaclty figure out the flavors but this was both one of me and my bf's favorite dish. definitely recommend this one if you're going here. Horseradish crusted salmon medallion with dilled cucumbers and mustard sauce - 8/10The salmon was super soft and not fully cooked, which was good cause it wasn't dry like other salmons  you would have at other restaurants. I like dill so I automatically enjoyed this dish, and the mustard sauce was tangy and gave you a kick too. I enjoyed the scallops more though. Roasted Quail with stuffed mushroom and pumpkin orzo - 10/10!!!This was probably my favorite dish out of the whole night! I thought the quail would be too much work but it wasn't and the stuffing in there was super tasty! the quail itself was sweet and nicely roasted as well. the pumpkin orzo was a good addition too. this is the other dish i would definitely recommend getting here!! Lemon Pepper duck breast with pears - 9/10The duck itself was good but it was paired with some sort of crabcake which kind of confused me and my bf cause it felt like it didn't go together, but it was nice that they included it anyway LOL. and the pears were pretty good too and they had some sort of fried fats on the side which went well with the dish. I think if the crabcake didn't throw me off I would have given this a 10/10 though. Herb crusted loin of lamb with dates - 10/10This was a lot better than i was thinking! I don't like lamb much but this dish didn't taste too gamey or anything, and the stuff underneath it was good too! another one i would recommend that you have to try when you come here.Seared Filet of beef with gnocci - 6/10Both me and my bf didn't really enjoy this too much, but i think its cause we realized we don't like filet. it was nicely cooked but i think the cut was just too thick for us so at one point it was just like eating raw meat. the potato gnocci was good but that's about it. Flambeed pineapple with olive oil and rosemary cake  10/10 this dessert was definitely exotic and you get a show right in front of you! it's an extra $6 but definitely worth it. Grand marnier souffle - 6/10this didn't impress me and I guess it just felt like too much egg white? or maybe I just never had a graasp on what souffle was but both me and my bf did not enjoy this as much LOL so i would recommend the other desserts.Espresso Martini - 8/10This was definitely a unique drink that I recommend if you are going to get a drink! ive never seen it anywhere else and it literally was a mix of both espresso and martini. Besides the food, even though I didn't think every dish was 10/10, service was very good and the whole restaurant was super sophisticated and there were some amazing dishes, and  that was enough for me to give 5/5 on our whole experience. our total bill with tip and tap ended up being around $400 but that was mainly bc we got 3 drinks and got the 5 course. definitely will come back here one day when i have a real job! OVERALL: get the seared scallops, roasted quail, foie gras, herb crusted lamb, and flambeed pineapple!"}, {"review_id": "RHMgvi4RLt-BgpC-BR5YSw", "user_id": "gH40ouZQR9fonXwn-4ko-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Superb.  Gary Danko was the best dining experience we had in SF and surpassed by expectations.  It wasn't cheap, but it was worth every penny.Attire - dressy, though being the bay area, it was less formal than I expected (I'm from DC).  Business casual is appropriate.  I wore a sports coat and no tie and felt perfectly comfortable.Service - perfection.  Warm and personable, with a big dose of California friendliness. Portions - I always get worried at tasting menu places that I'll be looking for pizza afterwards.  Not at Gary Danko.  The portions were more than generous, and the four course menu left us stuffed.  Also, what I think is brilliant is the portions are proportionate to the number of courses you order, so if you order the three course you don't have to worry about leaving hungry since the servings will actually be on the larger size than the five course.Standouts - risotto with shrimp and crab, branzini, bison, and duck breast.  All were exceptional.  The butter cake was lovely, though perhaps a tad over-hyped, but the Grand Marnier souffle was divine.  Mignardises were served with the bill, and we were sent home with a scrumptious banana bread for the next day."}, {"review_id": "WPSNDS9LrO7uxoekwojjwA", "user_id": "ZPN98PI53a9P7ZWM8V0qnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This was my second time to Gary Danko. It still remains my favorite 1 Michelin Star restaurant, but I thought that this time was a little less of an incredible/amazing/out-of-this-world experience than when I was here last November. There were no missteps that I can point to, but for some reason I didn't feel like the service was quite as on point as previously (although it was still very, very attentive), and the portion sizes were a bit smaller. Our group of 3 ordered 3 courses each ($89; 4 courses is $109 and 5 courses is $128; you can order any combination of appetizers, entrees, or desserts). We got the following:Appetizers:Seared Foie Gras with Caramelized Onions and Apples: 5/5. The foie gras is so buttery, rich, and succulent. My only disappointment is that it was about 1/3 of the size of the foie gras that we had here in November. Maybe with rising prices the portion size got smaller?Poached Farm Egg \"Carbonara\" with Braised Bacon and Brioche: 3/5. Probably my least favorite dish of the night. It was fairly small and while the egg was creamy and cooked perfectly, I didn't think that it had any very special twist to it that made it stand out. Seafood:Roast Maine Lobster with Potato Purée, Blood Orange, Edamame and Basil: 4/5 the lobster was very tender and went well with the puree. Beautifully presented.Seared Sea Scallops with Lentils, Roasted Peppers, Potatoes, Parsley and Madras Curry Vinaigrette: 5/5. The scallops were so tender and full of flavor. One of my favorite dishes.Meat:Seared Filet of Beef with Potato Gnocchi, Olive Oil, Swiss Chard and Stilton Butter: 4/5. A word of warning that the butter has blue cheese on it, and so has quite a tangy taste to it. The filet is cooked medium rare and is very tender.Roasted Quail Stuffed with Mushrooms, Truffled Corn Bread and Foie Gras with Pumpkin Orzo and Glazed Apples: 5/5. one of my favorite dishes. The skin was deliciously crispy, the meat juicy, and the stuffing had a variety of flavors.Lemon Pepper Duck Breast with Duck Hash, Celeriac-Garlic Purée, Belgian Endive and Cardamom Poached Pears: 5/5. One of my other favorite dishes. I just love duck, and the duck hash was excellent as well!Herb Crusted Loin of Lamb with Farrotto, Medjool Dates, Rainbow Carrots and Green Chermoula: 4/5. The meat had an interesting flavor. It had a little bit of gaminess, but not too much.Dessert:Chilled Peanut Butter Bar with Dark Chocolate Ganache, Feuilletine and Pretzel Ice Cream: 5/5. Excellent! Very salty, but that was refreshing against the sweetness and richness of the chocolate.They also brought out a complimentary amouse bouche, a complimentary birthday dessert, a complimentary set of assorted mini-desserts, and a complimentary pineapple banana cake for each person to take home. Overall, a great restaurant to go to for special occasions!"}, {"review_id": "15r1pAwZUDMp7jT5BV3Lwg", "user_id": "zLc5uKF6T2_p3hMYl1nw9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Gary Danko is one of my favorite restaurants in SF. The first thing that sets Gary Danko apart from other fine dining restaurants is how they set up the tasting menu. You order how many dishes you want in the preset, 3-5, and you can either take the chef's choice, or you can mix and match with other items on the menu as long as you still maintain the number of dishes, i.e. I can go with 5 desserts, or 1 appetizer, 1 dessert, 3 mains, etc. The second thing that sets Gary Danko apart is how generous their portions are; I didn't leave here still hungry. I would 100% come back!Service is very professional and friendly. The venue isn't large, and it's usually full; you can still have a conversation though.Ordered:Oysters and caviar - came with a pea puree, light and buttery, fresh oystersSeared scallop - perfectly crisped at the top, tender but with enough bounce in the center. Came with pea sprouts and a slaw like sauce on the bottomLobster - came with a generous portion of lobster, with potato puree, showered in rich lobster broth/sauceSeared Beef filet + gnocchi - good meat, pretty basicSoufflés - blood orange sorbet and sauces. Super fluffy, light on the top and substantial in the middle with all that sauceDessert platter - they offered us a nice dessert platter with assorted sweets Gift - gave us some very rich short bread"}, {"review_id": "-dMW-CQmLUEH79xTvwx8bQ", "user_id": "g8_9DrHkxK1fksf5Sa4euQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Restaurant Gary Danko was delicious and you won't leave hungry.  We got the three course meal for $89.  I had the (1) risotto with rock shrimp, crab, asparagus and beech mushrooms, (2) roast main lobster, and (3) filet of beef with potato gnocchi.  My boyfriend had the (1) Coconut Thai curry with shrimp, calamari, lobster, scallops, and mushrooms, (2) filet of beef, and (3) creme fraiche cheesecake.  We had two drinks each and the bill with tip, taxes, and whatever else CA and SF add ended up around $350.  So know what you're getting into before you go so that you don't have a horrible surprise when you leave!I like that you can customize your 3, 4, or 5 courses - choosing from any section of the menu.  Meaning, you could get 4 options from the dessert section or 3 filets of beef if you so choose.  I'm not a dessert person and was thrilled to not be forced to have that as a course as so many other places do.  They will modify the portion sizing depending on what you are ordering.  So if you get two appetizers and a filet, the filet will be larger in size than if you were to get two other meat options with the filet.In my opinion, the gnocchi was the best thing I tasted.  I would have preferred all gnocchi and no filet!  The steak was okay.  My boyfriend who is not as into food as I am raved about the cheesecake and actually called his meal \"out of this world.\"  A phrase I don't believe I've ever heard him utter.We were happy with the portion sizes - its not like the commercial of the couple who go to the fancy restaurant and have to stop at the convenience store on the way home to get more food.  But, considering you're paying $30 for each course, you should be full!Nice touch to send everyone home with a wonderful pineapple sponge cake for the next day.  Delicious!!No jacket required for men, but dress up anyways and have a great night out!"}, {"review_id": "dIxXWEwX94vqWE8-sc54Hw", "user_id": "lQqnueRjCYPTnVxk3_b7Kw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I want to start off by saying that every single thing I tasted was delicious and well worth what I paid. My boyfriend and I made a last minute attempt to get reservations for our anniversary and were lucky enough to snag a table around 9pm on a weekday night only days in advance. We arrived a little early and were invited to wait at the bar in the meantime, though we opted not to as the bar area was quite packed that night. Speaking of packed, the restaurant isn't all that large from what I could tell and so the volume is pretty high, just a fair warning. I honestly don't pay too much attention to service and so I'm just going to skip that and go right into the menu and the food. I really loved the structure of the menu as it allowed my boyfriend and I to try a great variety. You don't have to choose one appetizer, one main, one dessert, etc. If you want to choose all meats? Go ahead! If you have an uncontrollable sweet tooth and want to order just desserts? By all means go for it!! My boyfriend and I each chose a 3 course meal and our selections were oysters, seared foie gras, lobster, duck, quail, & filet of beef (we went the meat, meat, and more meat route). The oysters were wonderfully sweet with a beautiful pop of flavor from the caviar. The foie gras was by far my favorite and was not only wonderfully rich, but quite largely portioned as well (though not large enough to share with a ravenous boyfriend, I would probably order two of these next time!!). The lobster was flavorful and had an almost buttery texture to it that we really enjoyed (this plate would end up being my least favorite though, because I just felt like the other things on the plate didn't really complement the lobster). All the meats were incredibly tender and paired well with their accompaniments, especially the quail, and all three were fairly large portions. At the end of the meal, we were treated with an extremely rich chocolate dessert as we were celebrating our anniversary and were also given a small plate of sweets as well as a parting gift (a delicious pumpkin and cream cheese muffin).All in all, we really enjoyed our meal and would gladly come again!!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gary-danko-san-francisco?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
