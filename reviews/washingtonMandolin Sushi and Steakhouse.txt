Came here on Sunday, and it was pretty busy. Small parking lot, small place but looks nice and clean. The staff was very friendly and makes you feel very welcomed. While we was waiting, they brought us miso soup and edamame which is nice:)  also, while I was waiting, I saw other people plates and they was soo big and looks so good, so I wanted to try everything. We ordered Philadelphia roll, Spider Roll, Mariners roll and Volcano Roll. All I can say, now it's my favorite sushi place. Excellent portions and good prices. Even though I don't live in Tacoma, I'll come back here for sure and will recommend this place to my friends. Thank you."}, {"review_id": "LnqNCdS1ceX2c4-xmb0vkA", "user_id": "_v7O-aBWnQkWBIy4Y0DaCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Finally came in for the Hibachi dinner and it was worth the wait! We've visited once before for lunch but just sat in the dining area and had sushi and a couple of their entrees which was delicious then and now I remember why I always say we need to try their Hibachi dinner too!We live nearby and this place is always packed which is always a good sign and I noticed they built an addition to the restaurant as well so business is clearly booming for them.It was a Saturday and we were hoping it wouldn't be too busy, I think the parking can be deceiving which the lot was full but we waited maybe 5 minutes to be seated and another 5-10 minutes for out chef to come out so not bad at all seeing how the foyer was full of patrons waiting to be seated.We had just our youngest that night and knew he would be in for a trip with the Hibachi show and he was pleasantly surprised with the show that put on with this food. I went with the filet mignon, Hubby went with the shrimp and scallops and the little choose the chicken for his dinner and everything came out delicious! The only thing on my end was that the fried rice was a little salty, too much soy sauce perhaps? But other than that the food was delicious, my medium rare filet mignon was on point!We will definitely be back and then some:)"}, {"review_id": "d7AkUnw3j9f4yCXIDXjEag", "user_id": "tvKefUxWsnNBIrVsmt84BA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Have driven past for a few years, mainly because they are always so crowded, and parking is limited.1st visit, and was very impressed with the staff, and the food.

I would definitely come back again only for the Hibachi Lunch tho. They're nearly half the price of the dinner options. The starter salad was mostly iceberg lettuce, cucumber, and kale (yuck lol) drenched in a typical teriyaki salad dressing. The miso soup was a tiny cup size with like 1 or 2 pieces of tofu in it. It was good, but very little. I ordered the filet mignon + shrimp option. The fried rice was well seasoned and buttery, along with the shrimp. The vegetables were nothing too special. Now, I had requested my steak to be at medium... the chef LITERALLY left it to medium well, nearly well done. Smh... but the meat was still flavorful and juicy so I'm not gonna make THAT much of a complaint. LolNow in terms of the chef (Latino guy) we had and how entertaining he was, he really wasn't. I get that it was his 3rd day there I believe and I could see that he tried, but I also felt slightly uncomfortable. He asked me and my mom our ethnicities, we told him we're Vietnamese. Then he proceeds to say \"du ma\" (which means Fuck You) and asks what it means bc that's a term someone taught him. We laughed and let it slide after he apologized, no big deal. Then he proceeds to say it a few more times and was like, \"du ma means fuck you, eh?\" And laughs. But at this point it was annoying and literally not even funny anymore. Can you just juggle some eggs, do some tricks, light stuff up, and COOK MY FOOD because I clearly was starving and not entertained."}, {"review_id": "vDMUHH47XDRZAfH0K41DLg", "user_id": "A6KmNQPwqO3uhN0epjfhHQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/17/2017", "text": "We actually chose to try out this restaurant for my birthday on Monday, August 14.We were greeted so nicely and seated at a table where we could also easily see the chefs cooking on flat tops for others. Unfortunately, our waitress Sunny didn't have the same enthusiasm or welcoming demeanor as the person that we were greeted by. We ordered a few sushi rolls to begin as we'd continue to look over the menu. The Spider Roll was very good and my husband ordered another one as soon as he could spot Sunny again. He did have to recatch her attention while she was standing at the table due to her being entertained by another in a distance. With it being my birthday dinner, we tried to ignore the odd behavior which gave vibes of us being an \"inconvenience\" rather then guests. While eating our next order of rolls, we were given the check- not even halfway done! My first glass of wine empty and for once looking forward to a celebratory dessert. We couldn't figure out after the meal why we were treated this way and pushed out by the server when they didn't close for over another hour and a half.It's unfortunate because it simply was the service that will keep us from ever returning."}, {"review_id": "iY8maJbC9BimIEhTo6L-BQ", "user_id": "o_WXHMGwknTT1ugdg8O9fA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Very nice place, yummy food, friendly staff.

The serving sizes are huge so order accordingly! The food was okay but this is not authentic Japanese food. If you change it to an Americanized palate adjustment you may like it. I am pretty picky on Japanese so this is partially my bias. We ordered a California roll to start. I ordered the Shrimp and Calamari lunch. My husband ordered the spicy California Roll/Spicy Tuna Roll combo.Both came with miso soup - the soup does not have layers of flavor - almost tastes like water, ajitsuki miso paste, green onion and diced tofu...I was not a fan.The salad was good and ample. I tried the California Roll and the sushi rice was not flavored very much. The calamari was cooked very well. The shrimp was good and the fried rice was okay. The calamari raised my opinion a full star. Servers were very friendly and helpful."}, {"review_id": "L95UhXYykKdR_8Q8hCI2Fw", "user_id": "7RQ9TyjGYylyAFDiHBxSVA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "We were very excited to try a new sushi place in Tacoma for New Years. Mandolin got great reviews-so,  we thought we would try it.We arrived early for our 5:30 PM reservation. Our table was next to a drafty blue tarp covering the doors to go to the out door patio- very drafty and cold. Within 2 minutes of sitting down, the manager came to our table to tell us to hurry up and order- there were others waiting to be seated and it was a very busy evening. We explained this was our first time and needed a minute to look at the menu.  This did not stop the wait staff from coming every 30 seconds asking if we were ready to order. 3 of us ordered hot tea that was in palatable, while the rest of the party ordered beer.The food arrived quickly and had a pretty presentation however lacked flavor and was too heavy on cream cheese.  The waiter was frustrated that we wanted to order more rolls.Please note that we were with friends and were chatting, eating and drinking- all the time being pressured to hurry, we were asked about 5 times if we needed to go boxes as we were eating too slow. The bills arrived without asking if we wanted anything more.My husband and I are big tippers since we understand being a server is hard work- not tonight! Each party left minimal or no tip with a note to the manager about our displeasure. Needless to say, we will not be back to Mandolin. If you want to have excellent service and quality sushi, try Gari of Sushi or Domo Sushi instead- you'll be happy you did."}, {"review_id": "foNAWW7mnQ22EkfD3LNqUg", "user_id": "eOkzG2SZ553sSvsMtGn_mA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I was excited to try based on reviews.

We planned for dinner right before taking them back to the airport, and called to make reservations at our favorite sushi place.We were a party of 7 and waited while the hostess rudely avoided us because they did not have tables. Well, they did, but you know how that works.30 minutes in to waiting after we arrive on time, another party arrives, and is seated before we are even talked to. The \"manager\" apologizes while the hostess smirks at us.At this point, I'm starting to feel that the issue here is the sexuality of the people in our party. Granted, three were children, but four adults that are obviously coupled/gay. We've never had this issue before, but then again, we've never met this hostess before, either.So we sit there a little while longer, pretty pissed because we've watched bigger parties that weren't even on time get seated quickly while we were left waiting.We were seated 45 minutes after our reservation time, which had been reserved in the dining room, as we had no interest in hibachi and were there for the sushi. The \"manager\" seated us at the hibachi grill. We didn't mind. Just needed to eat and catch a plane, and get over the hostess crap that just happened. Waitress takes our orders and brings drinks. Everything is going fine.The \"manager\" comes back and says \"oh you ordered sushi? No hibachi? I didn't know or I would have sat you in the dining room.\"You're joking, right? Our reservations said dining room. Sushi. So she moved us, because there was another party that needed the hibachi grill. Like, we weren't treated nicely about it, either, but we acquiesced and moved to the dining room. The \"manager\" then dropped us and walked off, and that was it.I have NEVER had this sort of experience at a restaurant, and dropping that much money on a bill after being treated horribly was absolutely a slap in the face.Needless to say, we will be going back to Trappers and staying there. Mandolin has good sushi, but this experience ruined it for us. I'm still beside myself with how we were treated--- subhuman. Unacceptable."}, {"review_id": "4K5F55ZFZg2cFUWjF2U2_A", "user_id": "RFvOPBWiudQvNEfxcTBJ5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "This is our first time here and we will defiantly be coming back!
