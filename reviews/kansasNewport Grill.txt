For entrees, our table order a variety of items.  I was convinced on the pork chops which was ridiculous! It paired lovely with the bottle of Pinot Noir we ordered.  Everything on the table looked delicious as well.  It was unfortunate I didn't get the opportunity to try more!Service was amazing.  Aside from our server, other staff members visited our table regularly ensuring our glasses were kept full and any dirty items removed.  They even came and offered to take our group pictures which super sweet. Never did we had to ask for anything, well except for more cocktails and bread but i digress. Pricing is reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber.  Entrees range between $18 to $50 depending on what is ordered.  I especially thought the wine list was quite prolific in choices and had a variety of options and pricing depending on your individual budget.  Our bottle of Alias Pinot was $28 and was quite lovely!Decor is gorgeous, our table was situated across from the bar with a beautiful view of the lake! I mean the view just doesn't get that much better especially when you are celebrating with your family.  The music is loud enough to keep conversations intimate but low enough to where one can speak comfortable with table guests.Overall assessment: As a Dallas transplant from Wichita, I am beyond impressed with this restaurant.  The quality of the food, impeccable service and robust wine list can stack up against any fine dining restaurants out there. Five stars all the way!"}, {"review_id": "VOwvFgkoXopcznBxBS7H1w", "user_id": "3jjS8AeLYgR1V2Ksq8oJWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "Parking: Large parking lot for the shopping centerDrinks: Nice wine listAtmosphere: UpscaleFood: SeafoodReservations: Not necessaryStopped in for dinner on a Saturday night.  We had reservations, but there were plenty of tables.  Good vibe, upscale atmosphere.  Good place for a nice dinner out. The service was excellent.  We went with a bottle of Sauvignon blanc recommended which was very good.  We started with the ceviche which was ok.  Our server recommended the ahi tuna which was outstanding.  It was served with the crisped Brussel sprout leaves and cherries which complimented the tuna very well. My only complaint is that I wanted more cherries.  We also ordered the salmon which was ok, but forgettable.  Would definitely go again."}, {"review_id": "8T-nnvx-gQHFlAcQnILoiw", "user_id": "VL4cWDyE2Pg4vsQIevjQXQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/22/2017", "text": "Came here with my co workers for their \"happy hour\" at night from 9-10. We ordered a couple of different things and just shared. The calamari frittes were delicious. Their ceviche was alright, I have tasted better. My favorite was the jumbo lump crab cake and my least favorite was the coconut crab & spinach dip.. actually all of us weren't a big fan of the dip. All you can taste was coconut and nothing else. Their seared beef tenderloin was very well marinated and one of the best tenderloin I've ever ate because it wasn't too chewy or dry like most places and lastly, the p.e.i. Mussels were good too, but it was really small. For happy hour.. I believe it was $3 off of the original price for appetizers only. It's a little pricy if you went to eat at a regular time so I would definitely recommend going to happy hour to give it a try!"}, {"review_id": "WcQebS0RzTDoX5b8ta-P0Q", "user_id": "moMgADvpLpjcLkkM1jJDBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2017", "text": "Fabu Dahlinks! Excellent service; prompt, professional, knowledgeable; trainer should be a contender for Secretary of Education. Kitchen was wonderful, offering wide selection of oysters? In Kansas?I chose the bacon wrapped dates. Somehow felt this would be the safer choice. Strayed from this strategy with the main: Hawaii ahi tuna.

I've not only enjoyed their fresh seafood, but tried their Bistro Steak and it was simply amazing. Perfect medium rare with herb butter melting on top. My brothers who usually accompany me always rave about their new dish creations and how perfect everything is cooked.They have changed the calamari small plate; I found it to be too salty and needed to have lemon to cut down the salt. The Rock Shrimp Cigars are a must have. The shrimp taste buttery and the crunch of spring roll skin makes it that much better. Warm bread is also served to each table with a side of pyramid shape butter with pink himalayan salt. The ambiance is upscale. It's a \"let's get dressed up and have a nice dinner with wine\" place. If you're lucky you can sit next to the windows that look out to the Bradley Fair Lake. I've heard good things about their Sunday brunch and can't wait to try it!"}, {"review_id": "SfVnW4ubugfBUaOlO99tBA", "user_id": "hdVFsX40fUCM6mNvncjWSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "In Wichita, I was absolutely amazed at the quality, taste and presentation. The truth is this was my first visit and I had a penchant for oysters. Now, I cant eat raw oysters anymore so I asked the server (I believe was Katrina) to see if the chef could make them Rockefeller and fried. The chef did and the Rockefeller was by far the best I have ever had. The fried ones were great as well and not greasy and fried to perfection. I then had some of the home made ice cream for dessert. The food and experience was so good, I am going back tomorrow to try something else on the menu. You wont be disappointed and also ask for Katrina, because she just made the experience even more meaningful.

The seafood is SO fresh here, I forget exactly what the waiter said but they get deliveries almost daily. We shared the ricotta and olive tapenade starter which was great, a bit too oily but great. I got the kale salad and added salmon, I asked for my salmon grilled which it definitely was not it was too soft. I wish he told me grilled was not an option... But other than that, I loved my salad it was flavorful but light. The dressing is amazing and the kale is easy to eat, it's soft and massaged well with dressing.

I was here with a very large group of people and I would have to admit they did an excellent job at making sure every single one of us got what we wanted. My glass of water was never empty, which I found to be extremely impressive because I normally drink large amounts of water very frequently throughout my meals. Our waiter was meticulously attentive. I really liked the atmosphere as well. I started off with a Newport Clam Chowder. It was delicious! There was a perfect amount of clams in every bite. The chowder was flavorful and nice in texture. Its consistency was just perfect. We were later given bread and whipped butter spread to munch on while waiting for our main entrees. The bread was yummy. I enjoyed it very much. What I did not enjoy, however, were the salt pieces that were sprinkled on our spread. The salt made the spread way too salty for my liking. For my entree, I ordered the Norwegian Salmon with green beans and whipped potatoes. The salmon was amazing. It was decently seasoned and delicately topped with orange beurre blanc, perhaps my most favorite sauce of all time. I initially liked the whipped mashed potatoes. It was creamy and appropriately buttery. However, it got pretty salty quickly. The green beans were unevenly cooked, which one could tell right away simply by using two of history's oldest tools: the eyes. Some pieces were overcooked and some were undercooked.I went with the Banana Nut Bread Pudding for desserts and it was heavenly! The bread was crunchy on the outside and soft inside. The nuts added an extra crunch to each bite. The caramel was sweet, but not too overwhelming. The ice cream helped balance out the sweetness, surprisingly. The dash of ground cinnamon made everything even better. It was just a conglomeration of flavors in my mouth. Wow.All in all, I enjoyed the food here and I will be back soon. I really want to try their oysters and creme brulee!!!"}, {"review_id": "g-EMErjXZYusxuU3kuF_dg", "user_id": "m7bq0qnd2FT88xnHQt8l1Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "We had our staff holiday lunch at Newport.

The service was poor; slow and one server was  totally disinterested. Everyone finally received their food except for one person and so we all waited at least 5 minutes for the last meal to come. When I left I told the manager of my disappointment and he too seemed disinterested. I wasn't asking for free food, but rather letting him know his restaurant was a great disappointment that day."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/newport-grill-wichita?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
