I love there slogan fresh fast food .  The place is huge inside , Very nice decor and staff is very friendly.  They have s great health menu option At a reasonable price . I got the vegan blackened chikn with sweet potato fries.  It was amazing. The flavor of the tofu was perfect you couldn't really tell it wasn't chicken. Had a nice sauce with it with fresh cut mangos in the flatbread. I will say it was a perfect light,  but filling lunch that didn't make me tired.  5 stars !!!"}, {"review_id": "ktb16vBq9yTC_pTrZARHBw", "user_id": "2sMZdiFvZEqqFx_sDwKjzA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2017", "text": "As a first timer at this local eat fresh, fast casual restaurant, I was surprised how many times I've driven by this place and overlooked it. The plaza has tropical smoothie, a cigar shop, kids consignment store in the vicinity. I had been meaning to check this place out for a while. I typically like eating at the pho restaurant across the street so I was surprised I never payed attention to seeing this \"Cutting Edge\" restaurant.Before coming in they have planters of their vegetables and herbs. A lot of them were wilted perhaps due to the cold weather. Their kale was surviving aInside, My husband was unsure how the ordering process went and proceeded to sit down. The guy at the register just gave him a look and then went to finishing bussing tables. It was obviously a seat yourself type of eatery. It was pretty clear once I saw the Apple tablet and the register by the blackboard that you would order at the register station. The cashier, was really nice and she gave me a run down of their menu, the cook also gave me ideas of what was gluten free and vegan.I ordered the falafel salad which came with hummus and pita breadAnd the lamb soup stew for my son. The soup was so rich and filling. It containedLentils,cardamom, kale, tzaziki tomatoes, lamb chunks and onions.My falafel was good, it's nothing compared to the homemade falafels I've tasted in New York or New Jersey. But it was good enough with the salad. The salad could've used a little more dressing. I knew many people enjoyed it because I saw so many people ordering the same lunch special as me.Husband orders the pesto chicken sandwich and the lamb soup. Pesto tasted fresh. He really enjoyed the soup and liked that everything appeared fresh.Only drawback, they only had one bus boy. He was the guy who my husband pointed out, completely ignoring him. I understood that business gets busy. He was a young guy.I was happy to have came before the lunch rush came through.I will have to come again! Great options for everyone and for having a light lunch."}, {"review_id": "TNm2TAsCI3hMWcxbaDKm-g", "user_id": "zWDtUS7KGhBK0K3x54l97g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Great food but sort of pricey, not what you'd expect from the cafe type place. Like they have you tip...but I'm always thinking \"tip for what? Who am I tipping??\" Because there's just a girl at the cash register who takes your order and then a cook comes over and gives you the order. And the menu prices are high BUT that being said, the vegan chicken is amazing. It'll have you wondering if they messed up and gave you the real thing. And they'll swap it out in other items that have chicken in them so I always get a salad and swap out real chicken for the vegan stuff"}, {"review_id": "oWNKsRq5-fMSxI8WO9YBPA", "user_id": "Nw8xEp7xxcWBn3OHZhrz3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "OMG everything I've eaten here is legit AMAZING! The five stars is completely on the food quality - the ambiance reminds me of a Panera, and not even quite as cozy. The idea is to get in and get out on your way, belly full of delicious food. It's perfect for us since we're always in a rush at lunch. Now whenever we're in this neck of the woods, I try to make excuses to get lunch here.We've been in three times now -- the first time I had a salad and the grilled cheese and apple sandwich. I tried the peanut dressing and it was quite tasty, plus the greens were super fresh. The cheddar and apple combination was a winner - tasty, savory and filling. The next time I had the grilled cheese and jam. Three kinds of cheese, yummy caramelized onions, and fresh jam (it was a triple berry of some kind). WOW! Incredibly delicious. I ordered the sweet potato fries with it and damn - I'm not joking - these are THE best sweet potato fries I've ever had in my life! They are addictive. My only regret with that combo is that it was pretty heavy, so I wished I'd added a salad. So that's what I did the third time I visited - I tried a special they had going on, a caprese sandwich with tomato, basil pesto and mozzarella. I added bacon. Then tried the salad with the balsamic vinaigrette and ordered sweet potato fries on the side to share with the kiddo. Everything was excellent again. The only mark for me was that I didn't care for the salad dressing, but figured I'd just order one of the others the next time since I did like the peanut one the last time.Overall, this place is incredibly good. It's reasonably priced, service is fast, and the food is simply delicious.

Wow. I'm addicted. I almost abandoned my sandwich because that pita was freshly warmed and that hummus was freaking amazing. The quality of the food was fantastic. I went with the pesto chicken. My greens were fresh. My bread was so amazing I had to eat my entire sandwich that day. My only complaint was that my chicken was kind of cold. Everything else was warm but the center. I was starving, so I enjoyed it regardless! For less than $10, I got delicious hummus and pita chips with a pesto chicken panini? Yeah, I'll definitely be back. It was affordable. The guy behind the counter was cool. The place is comfy! It's a quick bite- excellent for lunch. I took my sandwich to-go, but next time I'll probably eat there and make awkward sounds as I shovel the hummus and pita in my mouth."}, {"review_id": "xqWAiVLzz_EDsC5i5XCkOg", "user_id": "YemltKFe8zt7sy1FhEPoHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2017", "text": "Soooooo good that I wish I could stay for dinner!But I refuse to sit here for six hours.

Their emphasis on organic and locally sourced food puts them on the map to begin with, as Chesapeake, VA is still catching up to it's sisters of Norfolk and Virginia Beach. For a good part of the year, they even have their herbs growing in raised boxes on the sidewalk, welcoming you in to what you can trust to be a unique and fresh menu selection. The chalkboard specials keep the variety going and are in tune with seasonal offerings. The last time I visited, they had a salmon chowder with house made bread; the chef actually poached a salmon fillet for every order before putting it into the broth.

It is great they have been sourcing some of their organic ingredients locally. You can eat in or request your dishes to go.It was easy and free to park.I will definitely go back to try the blackened chicken with vegetables and/or baby Bella chicken sandwich.

We also paired it with their sweet potato fries. The food was phenomenal. It isn't like your ordinary panera, their bread is softer and the aioli sauce makes it sooo yummmmy!
