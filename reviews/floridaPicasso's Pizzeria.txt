I've been here multiple times and have always thoroughly enjoyed myself. Of course, I always get pizza here and my all-time favorite combination is extra sauce, cheese, ham, pineapple and bacon. The ingredients are so flavorful and fresh with the crust always cooked to perfection: crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They have an extremely wide variety of toppings and are extremely accommodating.The space of the restaurant itself is pretty big but they can get busy on at night and on weekends. They also have a little party room that can accommodate larger groups. This place is my favorite pizzeria in Jacksonville, they truly craft their pizzas like art."}, {"review_id": "SQGhRt80ibjefw0RQJ4soQ", "user_id": "qqc3r1qETmHQEYVGDi8FLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "So, after multiple visits to the fine establishment, I run at feel well equipped to provide a review.Based on the shopping plaza, you would not think that this little gem of goodness was there. There's a casinoesque looking place, an international grocer and something else random. However, as the good book says, \"seek and ye shall find\"...and boy did we. Rising from the ashes of obscurity like a phoenix is the Picasso Pizzeria.Now, we've only gotten the strombolis and calzones, but if they make a pizza that good rolled up like a package, I'm sure that it's even better unrolled. The have an extensive menu with everything from pizza to seafood gumbo to the Kentucky Hot Brown to please even the most discerning palette.If you want to eat inside, earlier is better because this place fills up quickly, and with good reason. We've only ever had takeout because we are hermits, but the atmosphere seems relaxed.Back to the food...my calzone had Italian sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms. The crust on this thing was stupid (slang for amazing)...it wasn't too think nor too thin. The ingredients were fresh and it even warmed up well the next day.If you haven't, definitely add this place to your Jacksonville Yelp bookmark."}, {"review_id": "2hDGy3YTaOe1Ezj9FVfXcg", "user_id": "BPKH0zefkySH9nh4b8Y-PA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Food and service were great even when it was super packed, we got our table in about less than 20 minutes. Even with more people coming in the staff was very attentive and got everyone seated in a timely manner. The layout and design was very simplistic showcasing some very large paintings of Picasso's throughout the restaurant. The tables and booths did not seem too close together. They had a large selection of wines listed on a blackboard on one side of the wall and another with a list of their special on the other side. Which I think is great to see while you're waiting to be seated or figuring out what eat/drink. They did have a beer list, but you had to ask the server for the piece of paper.We ordered fried mozzarella and a large pizza: half with \"the cherry stone clam\" and the other half was the kitchen sink. The food came out fairly quickly and all was exceptionally good. I sadly, couldn't taste the clams on the clam pizza slice as it was buried in the sauce and overpowered by the ricotta and garlic. However, the pizzas were delicious. I can't wait to go back for dessert and some eggplant chips."}, {"review_id": "NoDmQxgBsiW_mRJKFNYwgA", "user_id": "cnLMF5SRe8HRpSF-5s01xA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Quality food and service.  Great pizza and lasagna.  Had three traditional ny style crust and it was excellent.  Wait staff was efficient and friendly.  Packed even on a Monday night.  Check out the butter cake for dessert - tasted like a vanilla birthday cake with frosting even though it did not have frosting.Check this place out - you will not be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "DmeIAcQVcJ2r0uZbjAKQ0Q", "user_id": "A9Z191Y9bVB3dQImlenGbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "What can I tell you about this place, this is one of those unknown secrets about Jacksonville that only true locals know about. Unfortunately I'm moving from Jacksonville soon after ten years so we just had to eat at this place one more time. As always the food was excellent. The stuffed Italian pizza is probably the best pizza I've ever eaten, well worth the 30-40 minute cook time. Salty deli meats, creamy cheese all baked in a delicious dough. My daughter also got a kids Mac and cheese that for 4 dollars could have fed two grown adults. This was not kraft Mac and cheese either it was luscious and creamy. It was probably the best Mac and cheese I've ever eaten. I'm going to miss a lot about Jacksonville but this is definitely one of the places that I will recommend and visit again if I'm ever in town...I'll miss you Picasso's you make some of the most delicious food I've ever had."}, {"review_id": "wvXqMFPAZEfbOT4JpRJgjg", "user_id": "cAvlJ-lvBywOjcG1FTC_7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Yelp led me here and it was great!

I should know, I married an Italian and my mother in law is quick to let me know what is authentic Italian and what is not. :) I decided to join my husband for lunch to take me to his favorite lunch spot. Picasso's is simple, welcoming and crowded for lunch...so I knew it had to be good. Ordering is simple. They have menus at the door, you decide what you want, order at the counter and take a number. It is a seat yourself type place, which I love. I decided to order a Caprese Salad and small side of garlic grilled shrimp. My husband ordered a pizza, new york style with pepperoni and mushrooms. We got a drinks, found a spot to sit and waited. Everything is made fresh to order here so patience is key. We weren't in a hurry so I wasn't concerned. We honestly only waited for about 15 minutes and I thought that was perfect. Instead of the normal whole leaves of basil, my salad had a basil pesto and balsamic reduction on the side. I loved this so much b/c I do not like overdressed salads. This provided me with the option to get just the perfect amount for me on the salad. For an extra $4 I opted to add Grilled Shrimp on the side. The seasoning was perfect with the perfect amount of lemon added during the grilling. My husband decided to order the pizza (he's never had it b/c he can't get away from his usual order Turkey and Brie Club...but he decided it was time to try something new). His pizza was a 12 inch and the cheese...dear lord the cheese. It looked absolutely perfect. My husband said hands down it was the best he's had since moving here...if not ever. Although I do question that statement since we've had the best of New York and Chicago pizzas...but I'll have to try it when I'm not steering clear of carbs. Stay tuned :)"}, {"review_id": "dCBmblrBFzLdTS6nNdZkVQ", "user_id": "xQ89rrVlKabplAsTmugX7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Fantastic food, excellent service!I've been jonesing for this place since I heard about it, a couple of years ago, but it's an hour and a half north of us, here in Daytona Beach. We went tonight, because we had to be up north for something else.Okay, negative (and only one) first -- they do not use Provel cheese on their St. Louis style pizzas. That's not a surprise, it's impossible to get in Florida, so they went with the crust (not quite a St. Louis style, you shouldn't be able to fold it, I did) and cut (perfect.) So, if you're looking for Imo's, in Florida, no, this isn't it.But that doesn't mean it's not excellent food, because it is.We had the toasted ravioli, which was fantastic, along with the Italian Stew Ball (basically a meatball, with some sausage cuts, marinara and a blob of mozzarella) the pizza and the finisher, a Gooey Butter Cake, St Louis standard and new favourite of my wife.Final answer? My wife is already demanding that we go back and I, as the original request, in my quest for a local substitute for Imo's, am a bit less so. Why is it so hard to get Provel cheese outside of St Louis?Ultimately, this is a great restaurant, if you're in the Jacksonville area. I can't see myself going back from Daytona Beach."}, {"review_id": "MtMQB7O69nG2rymEkv2l5Q", "user_id": "hazFjLv3rVO_9V9wSQ55Gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "So a few weeks ago I mentioned that coincidentally there were two restaurants with similar names that produced extraordinary food and service, Picazzo's in Scottsdale and Picasso's in Jacksonville, Florida. Today, I am going to write about the Jacksonville restaurant that has a very special place in my heart as it's a restaurant where I have had many amazing culinary experiences. It's literally the place where food is cooked and served with artistry and nothing short of perfection each and every visit.When I'm in Jacksonville doing business, there's one place that's a \"must visit,\" and a \"must eat at as many times possible,\" as I can in one visit restaurant. I know this sounds wordy but you get the point. If you're a tourist or visitor in the area, you need to trek to this restaurant because it's worth the journey.This INCREDIBLE and AMAZING restaurant, notice how many times I will probably say the word AMAZING, is located in a quiet strip mall and every time I come and visit, there's always a line in front of it or inside the restaurant. I always imagine there's some famous golfer or other kind of famous sports celebrity eating in there because it's always crowded. That right there is a sign of not only a successful restaurant but one with a cult following. No matter when I come and visit there's always a nice line of very patient and social people, dedicated regulars and traveling foodies waiting to get in.Again, it's that AMAZING.Luck must always be on my side because every time I've come here after a long day of meetings, I've never had to wait long and I get seated within about 10 minutes of arriving. Thank you food gods.From when you walk in until you finish your meal, you are surrounded by beauty in the decor and how the food is presented and cooked. The place is beautifully decorated with large paintings of my favorite painter, Picasso.If it's available sitting in a table in the center of the restaurant allows you to see all the art work from every direction. It's a visually arresting touch and makes for a pleasant place to have lunch or dinner.Now let's talk about why I make a point to eat here on every visit...the AMAZING food...Let's put it this way, when I die and go to heaven, I hope that the chef/owner of Picasso's is in charge of all of our dining. Really it doesn't matter what they serve, everything from the menu to the specials are beyond delicious.No matter what I've ordered here all I wanted to do was to even order more of the same thing. This place absolutely brings out the foodie glutton in me. I know you'll think it's crazy but I've sampled everything. That's how AMAZING this place is.Just like my favorite song in the Sound of Music, (Cue the music) here are few of my very favorite things:Fried Mac and cheese, Cheesy Bread, Garlic-Parmesan Bread Twists, New Orleans BBQ Shrimp, Lobster Fritters, Fried Mozzarella, Da House Salad, Caprese Salad, Shrimp Grits, Rosemary Encrusted Snapper in a Beurre Blanc sauce (OMG)And of course why I make it a point to stop here every time I'm in town...The New York and Saint Louis Pizza...(OMG OMG OMG)Not only do we order these two particular pizzas when we come in but some of us (ahem...) take a pizza to go to bring home to our room. Yes it's that good. One pizza is not enough. I have never eaten a pizza so perfectly cooked and with the best crust you could ever imagine. It literally makes my mouth water when I think of it.Now if that wasn't enough to make you drool for the more adventurous foodies check out the board on the wall with all of the daily specials based on what the chef finds when he shops every day at the fish, meat, and local farms for fresh vegetables. That's pretty special so I make sure I check that out first before diving into the regular menu.As far as the overall customer service and dining experience, the place is always bustling, the staff hustling, the place always spotless, food always served with love, care and piping hot. Service here is terrific and the staff whether they're greeting you or serving you gives you a world class dining experience.This place is not only a gem but a DIAMOND in my book.If only there were Picasso restaurants everywhere in the world....(hint hint Picasso's) I wouldn't have to make up meetings to go to in Jacksonville."}, {"review_id": "B_qL3Ze-3xIyZaNSFHhu-A", "user_id": "NDFiYfUn7bAr9gDIUv8EUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Calzones are super good and the pizza has a special taste which makes Picasso's one of my go-to places to get my cheat meals.

I went for lunch with a small group and we had a good time. The staff was really attentive and nice. I made my own pizza with NY crust and it was good- crust reminded me of the exact pizza I had in little Italy some years back. All of the toppings were fresh and everything was flavorful. My only gripe is that I would've wanted more sauce, but that's more of a personal preference.We also tried the fried mac and cheese, the fried mozzarella, and the capers salad, all of which were amazing. The only dish that I felt fell short was the risotto balls. I love risotto but these that I got had a much different look than the pictures of it I saw on yelp. I felt they were missing flavor and needed a bit of garlic, salt, and maybe some extra bits in the filling (like onions or mushrooms maybe). As other reviewers have stated, when you go for lunch, you order at the counter and then they bring your food to you. I personally have never been a fan of this, but again, it's just my preference.

So, I wasted no time in going to check it out. I visited on a Friday initially but given that we hadn't made a reservation, we opted to skip the 45 minute wait and to return a couple of days later.When we arrived just a few minutes before the lunch time opening, a few people were already waiting outside. Picasso offers a full dinner service but for lunch, you order at the register and grab your own drink.  Taking the recommendations of Mauricio at the counter, I ordered the \"the kitchen sink\" and the \"the butcher's special\" with a drink for $4.99. I rounded off my meal with the fried mozzarella and the butter cake. My dining partner also tried a couple of slices of pizza, the Caribbean jerk wings, and the hummingbird cake.Unlike during the dinner hours, pizzas at lunch come only on one crust - New York style. I've had my share of NY pizza and what struck me here was how greasy the slices were. I assumed it was because they both had quite a lot of meat on them. But the grease drenched the crust, making it soggy. The other issue we had was with the wings. They were served with a greenish sauce on top that was off putting to the eye and which made the breading soft and soggy.On the other hand, the fried mozzarella was nice and crispy with well melted cheese oozing out and the desserts were excellent! Their hummingbird cake had a surprise ingredient - bananas - and although the butter cake wasn't what I was expecting as it had a  gooey texture on top, it was absolutely delicious. There's no ice cream topping the desserts here though as I was informed that they don't have a freezer.Our food was served quickly and it was hot. As we ate, the servers were so attentive and helpful, despite it being the lunch hour. They knew that it was our first time there and they took great care of us.

Be prepared for lots of choices of crust--Mediterranean sounded good so we went with that.Appetizer came out efficiently--shrimp was cooked just right and it was presented/plated very nicely. The sauce is tangier and more on the buffalo-flavor side vs BBQ flavor side. I associate BBQ with a slightly sweet flavor now that I live in the South, but this was a NOLA BBQ so my taste perceptions may need to be adjusted...Pizza was good. Crust baked to optimal balance of crunch and softness. It's definitely not a Neapolitan-style pizza margherita, and don't let that deter you.
