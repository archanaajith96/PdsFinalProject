I hadn't been eating and late this Sunday I realized I was finally hungry. Toro was the only place open in walking distance. I love the Corn but I can't have something that heavy night before surgery so I chose -Datiles con Jamon:   Medjool dates filled with Marcona almonds and Valdeon blue cheese, wrapped in Jamon Serrano $6 for 2 They are delicious I've had them before and just is enough so that price point isn't bad. I took a gamble with the-Queso de Cabra V:  Soft ripened Spanish goat cheese, tomato honey, urfa, whole wheat sunflower-tomato bread $10Flavor was great!!! But there is only 1 small crustiini w/ a largeish portion of very ripe pungent cheese so you can't share. So the price tag is not worth it. Add more crusty pieces and this would be a home run.Being as I had to have my caregiver walk over there to pick it up. It was prompt, travelled well, temp was fine. A bit hard to eat with plastic.

We have usually sat the crowded bar before, but this time around, we have a table (woohoo!). While it was next to the window which was nice, the table is honestly barely big enough for one. Thank goodness I like my husband because our legs were essentially criss-crossed below the table for us to fit. He's tall and I'm short, if you have 2 tall people? Forget it...For food this time, we shared 4 dishes. The FOIE GRAS A LA PLANCHA is well cooked and tasty, but gosh when isn't seared foie good? The MAIS ASADO is a popular dish here and did not disappoint. PAELLA VALENCIANA is always a safe choice and it is quite delicious here with generous serving even with the half portion. The only dish that didn't quite live up to the standard was the COLES DE BRUSELAS or brussel sprouts. I prefer it to be much more crispy than this version.Overall, we liked the food this time around a bit more, but still not mind blowing (Curate in Asheville NC is still my favorite tapas places in the US). But the ridiculousness of the no reservations policy still bothers me. Just like how I'm now at a stage in life I rather have a reserve table at the bar/club instead of getting stomped on on the dance floor all night, I prefer reservations and having the space to stretch a little instead of crammed in tight. For these reasons, I don't think Toro will ever become a 5 star for me, but hey at least it moved up 1 star!"}, {"review_id": "2P3FExuuBDKp8QyEzznw2A", "user_id": "nQcNcS-1lUhMONXqimGsdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Highlights:- Good tapas restaurant- They take reservations, but only for lunch Average length:I could see why this restaurant might be popular for folks who live in the area. The space was warm and inviting, the service was spot on, and the food was very good. They take reservations, but only during lunch hours.Long:------------------F o r e w a r dThe Running of the Bulls is a multi-day festival event annually held on the streets of Pamplona, Spain. It originally stemmed from the need to herd toros (or fighting bulls) from ranch corrals outside the city to the city's central bull fighting ring. Today, it has become a world-renown global spectacle attracting thousands of participants and onlookers every year, drawn perhaps by a sense of primal thrill reminiscent to that of the ancient Roman gladiator games - except in this case, slaves and war prisoners with personal vendettas are replaced with normal dudes with a 100 meter head start and half-ton raging bulls with a top speed of 35 mph.Though the word \"Toro\" harkens back to this celebration of archaic violence, the experience at Toro in Boston's South End is far from that. You won't have to say, jump a fence out of fear of getting gored by an angry fighting bull here, or have to run with the sting of dirt in your eyes as an ominous trample of hooves creeps closer behind you. Instead look forward to great food, warm complimentary bread, and a great drinks menu.----------------Not sure what new insights one can really provide to a place with 1,834 Yelp reviews, but I'll share my experience anyway. It was a snowy weekday afternoon on a holiday. We came in for a late lunch and the place was packed, but we were seated immediately since I had made a reservation. We ordered the corn, the two person paella (really like a four person serving), and of course the bone marrow. The waitress highly recommended some stewed beef bean and egg dish, so we ordered that too.The paella was good, but that's coming from someone who had never had paella. My dining partner, who has had a fair share of this dish in the past was not particularly impressed, but still concluded it was decent. The fresh mussels, clams, and fish were great. Although, and this may be speaking to my ignorance, the rice tasted a bit bland and overly tomatoey, like something I could throw together at home. To be honest I expected more from the corn. People have described eating this dish like it was some transcendental experience. Articles have highlighted it. Books have been written bout it. Statues built. It was honestly just some grilled corn.The marrow was killer though, and so was the recommended beef dish - the meat of which had a nice red wine braised flavor.All in all, it was a good meal. Though the food wasn't cheap, which may be a slight deterrent to future return visits."}, {"review_id": "gh9E78VQkgKHX_6Mn27lqw", "user_id": "vBHMMyNbi7_r1qEnuweFWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Wow!  The most energetic restaurant I've ever been to.  Lines can be LONG.  Get there 1/2 hour before opening if you want an early meal otherwise who knows!Food is amazing.  Best paellas I've ever had.  Both the traditional and the rabbit/snail.  Best octopus too.  So difficult to get that right.  So many great dishes.  Wow wow wow."}, {"review_id": "Ei9Grn3J4mgpL02YHBAHkQ", "user_id": "EBW16o-gGF1mzGC1LgjF_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "This place was very accommodating.

The gambas al ajillo were tender and garlicy. I loved the saffron. The corn was seasoned to perfection and i loved the lime wedged to help cut the heaviness of the toppings. The uni sandwich was my least favorite of the dish. It didn't taste like uni; i did love the crispy bread though.

Friend and I came here on Tuesday night right at 6PM and already the bar and tables were completely packed; I was super surprised! As other reviewers mentioned, get ready to become cozy with other patrons because they sure squish people very close together. We ended up sitting at the high tables which were at first empty, but filled up entirely with a line out the door by 7PM. The hostess stands right by the door which I thought was kinda weird, but it makes sense as to not take up valuable space. Thus, get here early!The ambiance makes this place great for an intimate date. Each table has a small candle and the restaurant is tastefully decorated to feel casual and upscale. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu. We didn't have any drinks, but the menu did look quite extensive!OK now onto the good parts. We pretty much looked up what other Yelpers have gotten and WOW I will get all three of them again.Maiz Asado Con Alioli: aka the only corn dish I will ever buy because holy moly the cheesy sauce they drizzle over this is godlike. I never ever order corn when I go out to eat, but I am so happy I did. At first, it was just okay, but when I squeezed a bit of that lime on, the corn magically transformed into this entirely new experience. Wow I want more. (That dish with bone marrow): Can't remember the name right now, but W O W. not only is this visually impressive, it is INCREDIBLY delicious. I've never had such fatty and filling bone marrow. The dish comes with four crispy pieces of toast (?) and it is magical. I loved this. I dream of this. I need to come back and have more. If you are a marrow fan, oh god you haven't lived until you've had this.Paella valenciana: seafood and sausage paella! I've never had such a creamy thick paella before and I was not disappointed. The half size was plenty and we ended up taking about two spoonfuls of it before we were full off everything else! The best part was shoving cold paella in my mouth the next day for lunch. Ugh still delicious. Overall these three ended up being $63 with tip which is not terrible given the fancy experience and the overwhelming amount of leftovers. After eating the corn and bone marrow, we were already too full to handle the paella! Therefore I highly enjoyed my first experience and would totally come back again for both the food and ambiance.

The Jamon Serrano de Fermin as a starter was nice and the Sangria was good. But, I found that the Paella was the biggest letdown. There just wasn't enough seafood (I think 2 prawns and 2 scallops?) in it and it lacked flavor. The portion for the price you pay also wasn't very big. They ensured us that there would be enough for the 3 of us and it left me feeling meh. While everyone working there is super friendly and attentive, I am sure there are other spanish tapas options around in the city.

If I had to nit pick something, it would be that I wish the hanger steak came out a bit warmer - that's really it. The service was super attentive.

The bartender came to find me and then my friend ended up ordering the same drink (a delicious \"Nantucket Mule\").I would come back here in a heartbeat! Great food, drinks, service and atmosphere.

The Dutch Baby Pancake: Let me start off by saying I have never had a Dutch Baby Pancake before this (but I have always wanted to try one). I was a little confused when I first got the dish because it didn't look like anything I saw online of what a Dutch Baby should look like. However, the flavor combination really worked out!

With Toro, they created a culinary space that will remind you of the typical Spanish tapas flavors with a hint of something extra that makes it undeniably unique. Since this is a tapas place your flavor experience can differ dramatically depending on the dishes you order. The Uni bocadillo (sandwich/panini) was crispy on the outside with a layer of Uni in the middle blended with miso butter and mustard seeds. It was creative and super flavorful. Panza de Cerdo - Crispy Pork Belly was cooked to perfection. We also tried the Filete a la plancha (hanger steak with red onion marmalade) which was good, but not overly special. Although overall very delicious, I do think some of the tapas dishes are a bit overpriced for what they are. The highlight of the night was the Paella Valenciana. The seafood, the saffron rice, the juiciness and richness of this paella was in line with some of the best I've ever had outside of the US. We ordered the large one ($52) - it was way too much for 2 people , but I was glad to bring the leftovers back home because it still tasted amazing the next day. Must try and totally worth it!The place is busy, especially on weekends - if you are not interested in waiting for too long, get there around 4:30-4:40 before they open so that you can get seated at 5pm.

We got drinks and bread upon sitting, and were also notified of the specials- of which we ended up ordering one. If I had one complaint, it would be waiting a while for food..... but was worth the wait.This restaurant is primarily a tapas restaurant, so expect to be paying a little more for a little less. Regardless of these portions and costs, the food is undeniably great... but be prepared.We ordered only two small dishes: a potato and cheese omelet and the special- a calamari sandwich with squid ink aioli which was probably the most memorable dish of of my entire trip to the Northeast.Our main dish was the seafood Paella (though a vegetable option is available for cheaper) and though listed for 2 was enough to feed 4, alongside our other food. At $52 for the full portion, our final tab after tip ended up being very reasonable especially for such nice food. There is a listed 30 min wait for the paella, so order at sit down if you know you want it.If returning to Boston, I will definitely be making a trip to Toro. Parking is limited streetwise to 2 hours max, so plan accordingly. They are also not open before noon during the week, and only for dinner on weekends.

We ordered the following: - Vieiras Crudo ($15): Sea scallops with aji amarillo, roasted beets, hazelnuts and onion blossomsThis was presented very beautifully in a scallop shell, the flesh of the scallop was sweet and fresh, and the roasted beets (which were't purple..odd) and bits of hazelnut/onion blossoms lent a textual contrast to the dish.
