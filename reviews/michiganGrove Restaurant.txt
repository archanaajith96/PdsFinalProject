This was the place we would brag about and recommend to visiting out-of-towners. We considered it the best restaurant to come around since the venerable 1913 Room closed (still miss that place). Apart from the innovative menu crafted from fresh locally sourced, farm to table ingredients the atmosphere was cozy and the service impeccable. Their \"Taste of Grove\" option, which allowed you to select any three reduced sized portions from their diverse menu for a prix fixe, was the icing on the cake. But then something happened. The rotating menu which routinely offered house favorites together with new creative selections became somewhat stagnant and dull and the \"Taste of Grove\" option disappeared. It was still good, but not great like it had been. We went from regular customers to occasional customers to not considering it at all when we went out looking for fine dining. The excellent service and ambiance hadn't changed but the offerings became lackluster. We're happy to report that The Grove is back.After some misgivings, tonight we decided to give Grove another shot after a long hiatus. We are so glad we did. The menu not only once more includes unique items such as Walu Crudo and Beef Heart Paprikash but you can now order four selections from the \"Hot and Cold\" (appetizer) portion of the menu to share or two selections from the \"Hot and Cold\" section and one from the \"Main\" section on a fixe prix basis. Essentially the \"Taste of Grove\" option is back in an improved incarnation.The quality and presentation of the food is top notch and the service is as great as it ever was. We enjoyed the best meal we have had in a while. I had their always outstanding Beef Tartare, Razor Clams and White Bass while my wife ordered the Pierogi, Fried Brassicas and Vegetable Tart from the comprehensive vegetarian menu. Everything was amazing (although my wife found the Brassicas slightly over salted or over dressed). In short, Grove has recuperated its gastronomical excellence. They offer a broad, if somewhat over priced (even by restaurant standards), wine list and a tempting dessert menu together with a well executed and creative signature cocktail selection (try their Dark and Stormy).The wait staff is professional, accommodating and very knowledgeable about the various menu items and the atmosphere is as cozy and as \"casual formal\" (if that makes sense) as it has always been.Highly recommended (again)."}, {"review_id": "aRpn59GGcK5QI10EeYvsZg", "user_id": "f3zOsoc-SD7gQSkWuJIIDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "We ate some of the best food we've ever tasted Saturday night at Grove, our first visit there. My husband and I were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary, and our waitperson brought us complementary glasses of champagne to start the evening and then a butterscotch cream dessert to end it. They even brought a hand-written note that said \"Happy Anniversary!\"Our waitress was amazing, attentive, knowledgable. There are plenty of helpers around to make sure you get your dishes immediately after they're prepared.Be sure to check the vegetarian/vegan menu, even if you're not veg/vegan. The room is casual and attractive with farm details here and there.I chose the 3-course meal for $42, and my husband got four items from the top dishes in the COLD and HOT items for $42 (different lists than what is at their website). We shared everything. Next time we would probably each order just two items a la carte, because we were too full to finish the final dishes and took them home. (I was super disappointed that ribeye steaks were not on the menu. We avoid meat most of the time, but now and then when we celebrate we choose meat options, and I was really in the mood for a good steak.)CHICKEN LIVER PÂTÈAbsolutely fabulous. We groaned with every bite of toast spread with pâtè and cherry, orange, and apple sauce, slivered pickled cabbage, and crème fraiche. Can't wait to eat it again.DUCK NUGGETSI didn't imagine they'd be as good as they were. Lightly and perfectly breaded, just delicious paired with mustard and miso glaze. Would order again.SHRIMP & GRITSI'm not a grits fan, but the grits mix under the 4 perfectly cooked shrimp was scrumptious. Beautifully balanced. Let me say again: perfectly cooked shrimp, so rare.RED PORK STEWYummy flavors of turnip kimchi and fried ginger with juicy pork and jasmine rice. Topped with a soft boiled egg, super good.BEEF HEART PAPRIKASHThis is one of the dishes we didn't finish at the restaurant. We did try bites of the beef heart, which were delicious and lightly fried (I think). Delightful.BRASSICAS (from the vegan menu)This may have been our favorite, at least a close second to the chicken liver pâtè. I wish I knew how the chef cooked brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cauliflower--light, delicate, crispy, with a delicious sauce. It had something that melted in our mouths, maybe walnuts?S&S LAM BOLOGNESEI'm a big fan of a good bolognese, and this was the second disappointment of the meal (the first was that ribeye steak was not on the menu). Rye pici noodles were thick and quite \"al dente\" (more like chewy). Maybe this is an acquired taste, but I didn't get it at all. The bolognese sauce was just OK, not unctuous like I hoped. Please take this off the menu!HOUSE BISCUITSDelicate biscuits shaped in cubes with flaky layers. Delicious with house-made coffee butter and orange marmalade.Butterscotch cream at the end for a complementary dessert was out of this world.All in all an extraordinary dining experience, in spite of the two little disappointments."}, {"review_id": "jdM1iNyC4L36fESL2aJTYQ", "user_id": "O5sfCWKNaRQXrPGAIJ9KWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "Went here on a Thursday night at about 6 with a party of 6 (including 2 young kids). Had no wait to get in (in fact it was practically empty...that soon changed).The staff was exceptionally nice, and really great with the kids - my son asked if they had crayons and they brought not only crayons but full size, 1/2 inch thick coloring books for the kids to play with (which they loved!)No beer on tap, but a decent selection of imported/micro brew bottles. Their wine list is quite extensive, and they also have a nice cocktail list.For food - I had the most perfectly cooked Ribeye I've had in Grand Rapids so far. I asked for Medium Rare, and got it that way (in my experience you get things more on the medium side than the rare side when ordering that way). Everyone else in the party loved their food as well - Lasagna and Brussel Sprouts for the adults, and Grilled Cheese and French Fries for the kids (and the grilled cheese was outstanding. Big thick cuts of bread and hand cut fries. Worthy food for adults).They also have an outstanding desert menu that is both delicious and interesting to look at. The Chocolate Sphere that I had was delicious and also a great show piece - it changes before your eyes as the waiter pours melted white chocolate over it.To sum it up - a nice, slightly upscale (not so upscale that I can't wear jeans and a t-shirt) restaurant that I will definitely be going back to."}, {"review_id": "WQQQnwbpdIpuM0PfIXpQqw", "user_id": "hs8DpwHhp204x4tmuZR5ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Wow, by far the best meal I have had in Grand Rapids.

I had the beef tartare to start, it was delicious! I also had the wonton, which was sweet and sticky, but crispy and delicious. Lastly I had the chicken ballontine which was very savory and super tasty. My boyfriend ordered the quail, his plate was interesting and also very yummy! The house biscuits are AMAZING.

The temperature (i am really picky about this), textures, presentation and, most importantly, flavors were perfectly complementary of one another. My friend had the crab wantons which she said was amazing while we each had the walnut salad (again presentation omg) and the vegan fried rice. Delicious through and through!

First, make reservations. Trust me, you'll make your own life a lot easier.Second, appreciate the fantastic waitstaff. Our waiter was just the right amount of attentive, actually had opinions about the menu (Christ do I hate the \"everything is good\" response) and steered my husband and I in the right direction every time. Get the beef tartar. Never have I seen a more beautiful presentation, with gently mounded beef on long thin slices of sturdy but not overly thick cracker, and the egg yolk jam adding the perfect amount of richness. I'm not usually a pasta person either, but the rigatoni with smoked duck breast could make me a believer. You're think duck breast and creamy sauce would be overwhelmingly heavy, but somehow the smokiness and the heat balance everything out and the al dente pasta is a fantastic base. My main, the tempura skate wing, was pretty much perfect, delicate, crisp, with almost creamy meat. The dinner was just a super pleasant, shockingly inexpensive for the quality experience."}, {"review_id": "M4cEo10vsfk7Rifl1iBPrw", "user_id": "lTaQDHlav7tmBQRfLTI_QQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "If this review had a title, it would be \"The Night I Fell in Love with a Tart\".We were in Grand Rapids for a weekend trip and had several recommendations to go to Grove.  It was worth it!  The mushroom tart made my best things I've ever eaten list, but everything else was awesome as well.  To start, the service was awesome.  Our waiter was attentive and funny but not intrusive.  The pacing of the food and drinks was pretty much perfect.  I highly recommend the three course tasting menu; both DH and I ordered it though we ended up bringing his last course home.  I also had the wine pairing which was completely on point for each course.  Overall, a fantastic night of delicious food in a great atmosphere.We started with the beef tartare (me) and the shrimp and grits (DH).  The beef tartare was excellent.  Flat out one of the best I've had.  The shrimp and grits were good, but in my VA-born DH's words \"too froofy\".  LOL.  Tasty but didn't need all the extra bits that took away from the shrimp and grits which should be the stars.  Second course was the mushroom tart (me) and the lasagna (DH).  I tried his after he began raving about it, but I was so totally blown away by the mushroom tart that I can't remember much.  According to DH, the lasagna was the highlight of his meal and the portion size was double what he expected.  Pork in one layer and rabbit on another.  I was too involved with the mushroom tart to care.  The mushrooms were smokey and the cheddar worked really well along with a buttermilk based sauce underneath.  I thought briefly of divorcing my husband and trying to marry the tart or at least the chef.   It was at that point that we realized that at least one of the next courses was going home with us.  Third and final course was salmon (me) and lamb bolognese (DH).  Since we had an hour drive home tomorrow, it seemed better to eat the salmon and take the pasta home, so that is what we did.  The salmon was wonderful with a lovely coating.  But the rutabaga gratin underneath was the star for me.  I kept trying to get DH to eat more salmon so I could get to the veggies.  The pasta was tasty, though a little but over peppered for both our tastes.  It warmed up well and I am happily munching on it as I type this review.  I shall continue to dream of the mushroom tart."}, {"review_id": "YXnxeUiacpddJ40NaNGYzw", "user_id": "q9tG8MDA08AHySvRpS3AQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Food wow Service wow Atmosphere wow Overall wow Best restaurant in Grand Rapids"}, {"review_id": "ea7XT6b_XIIm7CJHYuihEg", "user_id": "ktrVH2FqxyXdHg6eZVs7oA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2017", "text": "Chicago foodie loves this spot!

There was also a great vegetarian menu option which I would have been just as happy ordering from. The starters or First were hard to narrow down, so I decided to build my dinner from that area only! We split the Deviled egg trio and they were all unique and flavorful. Will order them again. Perfect to share, as you get two of each. Also had the chili pork taco which had a generous portion of nicely seasoned and juicy pulled pork with some jalapeño slices for a nice kick. Also tried the house made pici noodles dish which was simple but yummy. Nicely seasoned with just enough cheese and herbs.

However, we each got three full courses! This made the meal an incredible value, but I did not plan accordingly and left feeling super full and unable to eat more than a few bites of the last course. First world problems :)However, the reason for only two stars was the horrible experience of having a GIANT SPIDER fall from the ceiling, bounce off our table, and land on top of the light on the floor near our feet. It was traumatizing - my husband had to squish it! This left us feeling anxious for the rest of the meal.

We were thoroughly impressed with our dinner here. We started with the Shrimp and Crab Tostada. The color of the shrimp/crab filling was not particularly appealing, and didn't taste of shrimp or crab. However, the flavors of this starter were interesting and delicious. We followed with the Heirloom Tomato Salad. Again, the combination of flavors was innovative. The dill overtones of the dressing meshed with the distinctive flavors of the roasted broccoli and green bean - The sweetness of the heirlooms tied everything together. We tried the lamb shoulder dish as an entree. The lamb itself was wonderfully tender and had a delicious sauce. The dish was topped with a round of toasted bread, which had a bit of flavorful cheese melted on top. So yummy!As a second entree, we shared a whitefish dish. The fish was perfectly cooked, very light, and had that delightfully crisp bit of skin. It had a white cream-based sauce, which added a touch of richness to the dish, and an herbaceous green sauce that added zing with a touch of heat. I got the Salted Dark Chocolate Fudge for dessert because I love all things chocolate, and I was not disappointed. The chocolate was complex, and wrapped around a piece of tender challah. Candied nuts added crunch. Just loved this dessert!My husband got the Dilley's Favorite Butterscotch Pudding, and I almost like it better than my dessert. I've had many butterscotch puddings, but I think this one was my favorite. It had a layer of rich caramel that took this dessert to the next level. This pudding makes it to my list of, \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate!\"My favorite thing about Grove was all of the interesting flavor combinations. We will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "L1lGQypJBp5b5HM0_kL0Gw", "user_id": "CA1tgo5PKPGqZH41Dgvyug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2017", "text": "Excellent food!

So delicious! There wasn't a single dish that I did not like and we tried a LOT of dishes. For dinner we tried the zensai, one of the salads, a duck dish, and a pork dish. All were great, but the winner had to be the pork dish. It is not something we would normally order at a restaurant like this, but we are so glad we did. It was extremely indulgent. It was basically pork snitzel (but better) with pretzel spaetzle and a sweet apple based sauce. Everything you could want in a fall comfort food dish. I think this may be my mother's new all-time favorite dish ever.For brunch, the Fried Oyster flatbread with tons of veggies, a pepita pesto, and an egg on top was AMAZING. It may seem like an odd choice for brunch, but get it. Seriously. We also tried the Johnny Cakes (the bourbon syrup was to die for), the cinnamon roll, the breakfast taco, the French toast, and the crab wonton. All good.

There is a fairly open dining area and a cozy bar area as well. It is comfortable and upscale without being pretentious or snobby.I always enjoy an excellent cocktail at the outset and both the \"Grove Fashioned\" and the Perfect Manhattan are outstanding and always made quite strong. The menu format has changed a bit over the years, with the three sections being replaced by two (a \"Starters\" and a \"Mains\", while the Snacks & Cheese section is still there.) Much of the food is sourced from local, sustainable farms and businesses and it really is artfully crafted into something wonderful. It achieves what several other restaurants in GR aspire to but can't attain (I would say a good analogy is that Grove is to Terra GR what a Bentley Continental is to a Chrysler 300.)Recently, I especially enjoyed the Collard Green Hush Puppies and the Deviled Eggs to snack on, followed by the Barbecue Chicken Taquitos with a great apple pico and harissa verde. Lastly, I tried the Wagyu Flat Iron steak with parsnip grits and black butter. Everything was amazing. For dessert, we got an order of the Salted Dark Chocolate Fudge with bourbon syrup and creme fraiche. And I always get an order of Dilley's Butterscotch Pudding to go.I did notice that the prices have increased from years past (the \"Taste of Grove\" menu with 3 options for $30 was probably not sustainable) and the new \"Taste of Grove\" is a Prix Fixe option, but the portions are larger as well. In my opinion, well worth it for such a great night out. If you love to cook, you will appreciate your meal even more. I will happily continue to be a regular here."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/grove-restaurant-grand-rapids?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
