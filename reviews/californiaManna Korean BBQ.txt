Quality of meat and side dishes were great and the service is fast. Downside is the occasional long wait for bigger parties but worth it. I have to say the GALBI meat is the best, the tofu soup is actually on par with the tofu houses, and the pickled vegis are flavored perfectly. Definitely recommend."}, {"review_id": "YHlqZFNBtuZNHz3avOwsJg", "user_id": "d2-084oRPaJdVZxQrwEovQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Lunch $15.99 AYCE. Pretty good.For those that are new to Korean BBQ all you can eat:1) Three different options. L1 (lunch only), A1, and A2. The higher in price you go, the more meats that are available. Everyone at the table has to agree on which price to pay.2) Everyone picks from the list what they want to start out with. They will bring the side dishes after taking your order.3) The uncooked meats/veggies will come out and you throw it on the grill and cook it on your own.4) As you finish what you have, you can hit a call-button to let them know you are ready for more. You then tell them what else you want to order, from the list that you chose in the beginning5) Repeat 1-4 until you are full.We went here for lunch and tried most of the meat options. We skipped some of the chicken ones. Everything was good, except the large intestine. It was really fatty and left a strong after taste - you have been warned.The service here is VERY fast. You do not have to wait long for anything. They will also change out your grill if needed (if your current one has burnt pieces stuck to it). I like this attention to detail a lot and would like to see other places do the same."}, {"review_id": "xikz5cR4cmYOfY6eLx5z4w", "user_id": "5r5pQn9xr0EpAujYDwVU5w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "We went there with a party of 8 to celebrating our tape outs.- Parking: too tough to get it during dinner time.- Lines: got to waiting in line since they did not take a reservation (?), we ended up to waiting for more than an hour to get our table.- Waiting room: nope, wish they have it since this place was very packed.- Food quality: just OK.- Service: a little slow even we rang the bell at least few times.- Price: a little pricey overall, but it is OK since we are not going to eat it on daily basis :).- Staffs: mostly OK.- It was a little challenge for big group in a window of 2 hours (?) policy as the lady server told us, and slow eaters like few of us."}, {"review_id": "4ekrBggfUP6vlFTO2CeeVQ", "user_id": "0gvetX-CZwk85wvHU_gJ5A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "It has been quite some time since we have enjoyed Manna BBQ but each time we go, we leave feeling very satisfied (and slightly guilty for eating so much) [: SERVICE - There always seems to be a line out the door during peak hours but it is expected.

We love their marinated meats but enjoy the non-marinated ones as well. We like the dipping sauces for the non-marinated meats.

It's awesome to go in a group and eat a ton of food. What I love beside the good meat options is their sides. I ordered rice paper, which is such a staple of my Vietnamese diet, I was just in love at the moment that they had that option. I also enjoyed their squid! It was very fresh. Our table was in the back, and had a tv where we watched the basketball game. The noise level was very doable and the service was constant. We had multiple people help us, as we continue to order over and over again. I think they were a little shock at how much we were able to pack away! It's the next day and I'm already craving for more. Also, our wait time was 30 minutes, but we were able to get in around 15 minutes. Their system is efficient, as long as you're around to hear your name called. I highly recommend this Korean bbq above most, especially around Convoy. Parking is a little tricky, but there's always room on the side!"}, {"review_id": "GTma8Hti_MnP59R0eArg4Q", "user_id": "T1ZDOuZxeBK-SaowZqYl_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "Manna has started a meat revolution in San Diego. Their restaurant became highly popularized in the recent year because their manager has realized the force of yelp marketing and they treat their customers to Ice cream every so often if they leave a good enough review. I was part of a table that got randomly selected for this about 1.5 years ago but have been back since about 6 times and haven't been asked again. Anyway this review is for my honest to god love for their service and quality of meat. Since Manna's success @ Convoy, I've seen many other Korean specialty meat restaurants pop up: gyu gaku (not ayce), jeonju won(sp?), one Korean ayce open right besides mission valley Buffalo Wild Wings, Taeguki, and their second Manna in Mira Mesa. I've tried them all and what I love about Manna is their ayce is such a deal. The meat quality is great and when you eat with a large group you can try a  variety of their meat selections and avoid  getting full quickly. When we came here last night I saw they set up an electronic check in system-- I'm all for efficiency!Pro tip: you can request mushroom, onions, or sesame sauce One last pro and con:-pro : long benches inside for waiting -con : small intestine isn't as yummy as their large intestine - avoid !"}, {"review_id": "Z7rymc47nR7dCRdBhbY7Kw", "user_id": "uQ1n8TV-sGuuxY8NCIIT7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Great BBQ spot in San Diego.

They were very attentive this time and i didn't need to press the button too often because there was someone always around to take our orders and give us more meat/water. The grill changes were fast, but needed to be done quite often because the heat was on so high. So we asked to turned it down.

And once again we just let it go (for the 2nd time).  And she came again with our expectedly 'fried rice'.  She only gave us 1 fried rice and 3 PLAIN rice...and we said \"I'm sorry we asked for fried rice all around\", and guess what she said.....she was like \"Fried rice? No it's okay, white rice is okay.\"  Also I'm like, I've had enough, we came there to eat whatever we wanted, and not what the server wanted...so my friends and I just left and went somewhere else.  We couldn't believe the customer service we had.  So up til now, my friends and I still don't know if their food is good or not, but their service?

They recommended Manna after a day of walking through Balboa Park. It was a great recommendation as I was starving and upon entering the delicious smell of KBBQ automatically registered as Manna being authentic. The cheaper menu is definitely a good choice because there is just so many to choose from and you will get full after a few cuts. The LA galbi, bulgogi and pork belly is definitely top 3. They were all so delicious, my mouth is drooling as I am writing this review. My bf had all the veggie items they had to offer as he does not eat meat and the soondubus were great making him enjoy Korean food. The squid was definitely fresh and they were chewy. They didn't have much flavor being grilled but if you had it with their special sauce it was mouthwatering.I absolutely enjoyed my time at Manna. The servers are quick to come to you if you need additional items but they don't grill the meat for you which is good because everyone likes it cooked differently. I wish they would add more veggie options but who comes to KBBQ for just veggies? (Only my bf lol). The banchans were good as well and like any authentic Korean restaurant, you can always ask for free refills."}, {"review_id": "fjniOsN04UAUQtKbgKtoAA", "user_id": "GlT3DIot81AHeLPY8G0gHQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "As a SD newbie, I didn't know where to begin to satisfy my KBBQ cravings but all questions and paths led back to Manna.

I don't believe there are reservations, but they do offer cable TV on 6 interspersed flat screens. Service: despite the place being so busy, our waitress was accessible. Of course, you have to take the initiative and call for their attention, but it's not \"Find Waldo.\" Refills on meat and side dishes were promptly delivered when asked for. Price: it's a bit pricey compared to the LA joints I'm used to, but the meat quality was great and it's market price for SD.

My boyfriend and I have been here a handful of times as he goes to school at SDSU. I've been to many KBBQ places, and this one is hands down my absolute favorite. The quality of their meat is exceptional, especially for their price. The marinade they use has an amazing flavor and the meat always tastes fresh. They also have jap chae which is my favorite. I've surprisingly been to quite a few KBBQ places that don't serve it at all, and those that do definitely don't taste as good as Manna's.The staff here is great. We are constantly being checked on, they change our hot plate multiple times during a single sitting, always make sure we have what we need, and overall always come off as being extremely welcoming and accommodating! This is definitely one of our regular go-to spots. :) Thank you Manna for your great service!!!"}, {"review_id": "mgdR_wPCwWIAAlD0jsK8AA", "user_id": "ba8eTAAg7Ol_0BuQ7c90ug", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Was in San Diego for a business trip and came here for some KBBQ for dinner after a long day of meetings.

I wouldn't have minded giving this place a four star rating but I lowered it down to 3 because of the waitress. She was inattentive, forgot our requests, and didn't really check on us. When I tried to order more food, she asked if we wanted a smaller portion and if we're sure we'll finish all the food. That got me pissed. I'm aware of AYCE policies, so just bring me my damn food.
