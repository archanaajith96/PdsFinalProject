It was very quiet when we went so we got a very good attentive service as there were 3 other table in the whole restaurant.  The calamari and the duck roll was amazingly good.  I really liked their special rolls. I ordered the one that has the gold flake. The regular rolls I feel were a bit over price but still tasty to say the least. I will definitely give Feng another chance whenever I feel a little extra."}, {"review_id": "XVcxBTok-MdUBT5rwNeFgw", "user_id": "UBLmYc34g7ES6Of5QI8l7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2017", "text": "Wonderful night at Feng, pleasant Valentine's day service.Being sisters with the amazing Ginza restaurants, Feng is the even more upscale and high end variant of the two.Assuming most of you know what how Ginza is (as you should since Ginza is one of the best Japanese Restaurant's in this area) that says a lot about this restaurant. Feng has great food, I experienced great service though they seemed a little short staffed tonight but it wasn't a major problem for me. Food you see at Ginza and Feng is about the same price, same amazing quality. Oh and of course the restaurant is gorgeous. Ginza being pretty enough, Feng tops off a gorgeous dining area with high end decor and architecture. This is where the \"upscale version of Ginza\" comes into play.You will not see cheap entrées and $3-5 appetizers here during the dinner service. Feng is too high end for that. You can still get cheap, basic sushi rolls which is never a bad idea but you're better off going to Ginza or even Ginza express which is right next door. What you'll find at Feng is a bunch of dishes you will not find at Ginza. Of course some items are the same and at the same price, but they have lots of items on the expensive side compared to their cheaper counterpart. You won't find $15 Yakisoba or Fried Rice here. Instead you'll find more exclusive entrées ranging from about $20-30 and Special Sushi Rolls starting at $16 and up to $22 each. This place isn't cheap but in my opinion. It is not over priced.That is what I'm trying to say. Feng IS expensive, but it is NOT overpriced. They just don't have many cheaper options. I've seen some cool entrées here though. Many people ordered the Self Seared Kobe Beef (which is probably Wagyu, I'll gain so much respect for Feng if I see their certification to serve authentic Kobe Beef) but anyways it looked amazing. You sear it yourself on a hot rock plate surface type thing, not sure what it's called. But it looked worth coming back to give it a try.I know for lunch they have cheaper options though, there's just so many reasons to come back to this place.My reason for 4 Stars is because I need to try something from their main entrées. The entrées seem to be the things that shape Feng into a high end Japanese Restaurant. I came here and got 4 Chef Special Sushi Rolls. They were all AMAZING except for one of them having a fish scale on them but it was a mistake, they were SUPER busy, and they got it to my table QUICKLY which was much appreciated. It wasn't a major issue so I will not deduct that from their score as there's much too many factors and I cannot judge a restaurant from a absolute miniscule mistake considering the factors involved with the incident. There's lots of Rolls here you will not find at Ginza though.As you can see, Ginza and Feng have exclusives to each other and have many reasons why to go to either one. But tonight's visit for me, I wasn't able to try one of those Feng exclusives that puts Feng into the high end category in which it stands. Therefore, I will leave this review at 4 Stars. But from what I've seen myself, Feng does deserve a better rating. They failed to disappoint me tonight."}, {"review_id": "sh_WBbV5xEtzoLWiYa1vwg", "user_id": "eEGoWrI7e94OMJ9Judd90g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/21/2016", "text": "I was in Hartford on a business trip and after my flight landed I was starving and craving sushi, as usual. Me and a coworker stumbled upon this place and the menu looked amazing so we thought we would try it out. I have to say that it was definitely more expensive than we wanted and we must have looked over that part... Woops. We spent a little over $50 a person for two rolls and a side salad each. But the sushi was some of the best I've ever had. The salmon melted in my mouth and the presentation of it all was awesome... So colorful and unique. The Feng Shui roll had gold flakes on it, which I'm still obsessing over.Service was good and very responsive, but we also went around 6pm on a Wednesday night so it could be different when it's busy!***Follow my Food IG: LinnysLunchbox"}, {"review_id": "GzNY9OZKdMoAm7apdQNUHA", "user_id": "KlCBP0Wo-z2zjCoWc36lQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/23/2016", "text": "Great spot right in downtown Hartford.

It also helps that they have Groupons on the regular. The waiters/waitresses have always been extremely attentive, I think partially because I'm usually there at lunch and there aren't many other patrons at that time.

Working in the area, I frequently come for lunch but I have never been for dinner. As a lunch option though, they offer many good dishes including a two roll special that comes with soup or salad. I've found the service to be very good but sometimes you can be seated and served and out the door quickly whereas sometimes it seems to take forever. My favorite dishes here include the Angry Dragon roll which is on the pricier side but has shrimp tempura, spicy tuna and papaya with a rutta sauce and eel sauce. The rutta sauce has a sweetness to it while the eel is savory and all the ingredients just make for a delightful tastebud experience. I'll also do the spicy salmon and tuna rolls if I'm feeling less adventurous. For non sushi, I like the General Tso's Chicken. They also have several bento box options that are all very good.If I could give Feng 3.5 stars, that would be my rating."}, {"review_id": "CINd5rinM9tfcB2u-uY4-Q", "user_id": "xOzwyWTN-fR0aogCxwEWgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2016", "text": "This is an exceptional restaurant.  The food is always great, the service is attentive, and the atmosphere is perfect though noisy for any occasion.  I have been here for romantic dinners, family dinners, business lunches,  or alone for a quick bite.  From the outstanding omikase (chef choice, top shelf sushi) to the standard but tasty pad thai, everything is prepared well, served nicely, and priced reasonably for an upscale place.For sushi....the omikase is superb.   For lunch today, I had their lunch combination of 5 pieces of sushi, 9 pieces of sashimi, and a spicy tuna roll.   The tuna I had today tasted like  bluefin.  If it was not, it was unusually fatty and delicious.  Usually, they serve high grade ahi.  The salmon is almost always the belly, the tastiest portion.  The yellow tail was fresh but standard.  The rest was all tasty.  The other foods I have eaten there have all been excellent.  The service has been impeccable.  The selection of food and beverage is expansive and varied.One prior review I read spoke ill of the management.   I highly disagree.  Bill Murray treats every customer like royalty, walking around the dining room and giving his personal attention; in fact, that alone is worth 5 stars.  But this restaurant succeeds in every possible way."}, {"review_id": "Bj-VlLKp_sq5wDJvcf5QfQ", "user_id": "ew3nk14MJ81mAVoiQODLSw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/20/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Old review: The service was very slow, and it wasn't that busy!! The sushi is below average. We had dragon, dynamite and tempura shrimp rolls and they were not that good! Duck spring rolls very oily and have no flavor. Vag noodles were ok. The tempura green tea ice cream not good at all! Re-review:  Let me start my re-review by saying that their customer consideration is 5 stars. They really care about their customers which is a great thing. However, I still have to be honest about the whole experience in terms of food, service, and price. Update: we went to the place again last weekend to give it another try.  the service was much better. We met the manger who came to our table and to make sure that everything was ok. This time we ordered different dishes than the last time. Here is what we ordered:We had the Kobe beef which was really good Although it was kinda fatty.It's a Self Seared Table Side on a Hot Volcanic Rock, Soy Lime Dipping Sauce, Fresh Wasabi, Sake Pineapple Nectar. We also had some complimentary salmon yellowtail and tuna, salmon sashimi and they were good. For main dish we got the Shanghai braised short rib with risotto and we liked it.  For dessert we had the  salted vanilla crunchy cake, it was ok. Overall our visit this time was much better food wise and service as well. Although I think it's over priced considering the food and the location. Therefore I would give it 3.5 stars"}, {"review_id": "jWbLF-ySl4FQonE1yZcQIg", "user_id": "A34UA_mlUd9wmBO6JLFOqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/8/2017", "text": "My friends and I make reservations here for every connecticon.

Members of our group had all been there a various amount of times. The interior has a modern Asian feel. There is a bar that is separated from the dining area as well. In short the food was delicious. We started with a Kobe beef appetizer which really set the mood. We followed with our main orders. I ordered fatty tuna sushi (per my waiter's suggestion) and their holiday roll special. Both were exquisite. Other rolls ordered by our table included the Paradise Roll. Although my order was delicious and easily something I'd order again, I'd say the paradise roll stole the show. For any non-sushi people, one member of our table ordered the braised pork and loved it.Often times I think Hartford restaurants do not get the appreciation they deserve since many people in the area opt to go out in suburbs (weha, Glastonbury, etc.) but that is slowly changing.
