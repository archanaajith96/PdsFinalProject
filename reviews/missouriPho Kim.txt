You need to have it with the fish sauce . And the Lemon-grass Pork grilled Banh Mi sandwich is on point. However, the Pho is okay (not greasy), but the Umai deep flavor is not developed. It seems like it is missing the Star Anise. It is still very good and you have to ask for veggies (like the bean sprouts, mint, that usually usually standard for Pho).Overall, very clean place for some simple Vietnamese food. I also think this is the best in town."}, {"review_id": "WG_irDngqBbtmdVFiBbrdA", "user_id": "KgDtoAvntrW45_F9iWF41Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "Pho is a relatively recent addition to my selection of culinary pursuits, so my take on the dish may not be as nuanced as a more experienced diner, but overall, I was pleased with my experience at Pho Kim. I had the opportunity to try two separate dishes, and discovered that the broth varies widely between them, which I found interesting. My pho tai chin was light and influenced more readily by the addition of jalapenos and thai basil (not unexpected considering it contained relatively paltry helpings of meat), while the pho thai broth felt heartier overall. I've only begun to explore the various options for this dish here in the field of springs, and may update this review once I feel more confident in my opinion on the subject - but for now, I am confident that those who enjoy the dish will find Pho Kim well worth visiting."}, {"review_id": "2g0kUJ_f7gDZKSH87BP0xw", "user_id": "L8w_x5Ku6pnxzyxcaxdT1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2017", "text": "Omg, they reminds me that my mother made it for us as fed kids in a few years back.

My #1 favorite pho place in town closed, RIP Pho Cafe. Kim's is a close second. I love their vegetarian spring rolls. They're so fresh and crunchy. I usually always get the Pho Ga and add vegetables. The broth is excellent, full of flavor and has a slight kick to it. The chicken is all white meat and delicious! I've also tried the vegan Banh Mi and it's so good. The bread is soft yet crunchy and the tofu inside is flavorful and cooked well.

The spring rolls were incredible. Fresh, crispy, herbaceous and the peanut sauce for dipping was just as good. I could have had 2 more and not feel guilty. The soup was a massive bowl and way nor than I could eat at one sitting. The aroma was the first thing that told me that this was going to be more that just good. It didn't disappoint. The noodle were done just perfect and not \"mushy\" at all. The server brought fresh herbs and bean sprouts as well as fresh jalapeño slices. Wow, the meat were tender and full of flavor and the broth was perfectly salty and spicy as well as full of flavor. The service was spot on. She guided us on our questions and was very helpful in us choosing our dishes. So don't be shy come try this great spot.

Two employees stood behind the counter and stared at me and my friend before I finally said, \"I'm not quite sure where we're supposed to go.\" They told us to sit anywhere we like and we sat down and ordered drinks. They came promptly and we were ready to order. I got a bowl of Pho Tai and some Cha Goi. Food was timely and fresh. The beef in the Pho Tai was delicious. It was sliced so thin, it melted in my mouth. The Pho broth was lacking flavor except for a smell and after-taste of fish. The noodles were stuck together, all of which made the bowl pretty unappetizing except for the beef. The Cha Goi was dry and lacked flavor as well. I asked for some soy sauce and was met with hesitation by my waiter but he went in the back and poured some into a bowl and brought it to me. I am aware that soy sauce is not always a typical condiment for Pho, but it's an Asian restaurant. I mean, c'mon. There are other places in town to satisfy my Pho cravings. I'll just hit those."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-kim-springfield?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
