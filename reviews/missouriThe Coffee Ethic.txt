I've been wanting to try this place for awhile, but just never found myself on foot around the square. The ambiance is very modern, and casual. Not lots of places to sit, but I'm sure if the weather was nice I'd be outside anyway.Ordered a cold coffee from a polite barista, and took my coffee to the prep table... Man why doesn't everyone have stevia yet?!!!I was pleasantly surprised by the robust flavor, not as strong as Starbucks, but not as light as Eurasia. The coffee had a nice rich blend of the two. By no means am I an expert; I just know Starbucks tastes burnt to me. An okay price not the cheapest or most expensive. Would definitely go again to set outside and enjoy a brew, also had no idea they sold beer!"}, {"review_id": "HpHQihvKrEFfJmZkbfg5wQ", "user_id": "RQiRq5ISgGsWZGn5kp0EkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "The Coffee Ethic has a great vibe, strong internet, and approachable barista. The baked goods (I actually did a no bake cookie) are made in house and the healthy protein bars are from a cool place in Kansas City.

The coffee ethic has good coffee, fast service, and friendly service. The ambience is relaxed and hip for the area.

Very nice shop with lots of room work or visit. Located on a downtown square so there's room outside to enjoy your java on a sunny day.

It's pretty inexpensive and their drinks always delicious. I wish they had a broader selection of snacks (I think right now it's pretty much limited to a few types of cookies and some granola bars and stuff). This is a great place to go to meet up with friends, but it can get a little noisy, so I don't recommend using it as a study spot (I have, and it doesn't work well if you need it to be relatively quiet to study)."}, {"review_id": "47HcGLe4lOpidl2PDv99tA", "user_id": "iHV9Sn-2pI0d8OP6zClqzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/23/2016", "text": "Nice place, friendly staff, and okay location if you're visiting.

Well, The Coffee Ethic absolutely blows my mind. This is a top tier coffee shop, Springfield or otherwise. You'd be wise to check it out.First of all and most importantly, they pour an incredibly high quality product that they're knowledgeable about to boot! Whether you want a pour-over or an espresso drink, they've got you covered. It looks like they're currently serving beans from PT's Coffee out of Topeka, KS. Learn that name, coffee geeks. You'll be hearing it a lot more in the future. Oh, and they have beer, wine and liquor, if that's how you'd prefer to start your day.The atmosphere is on point. I absolutely love their coffee bar, with its Frank Gehry-esque facade made of curved dark woods. Table options range from private spots for one to larger spots for meetings spaces, and even communal tables with reclaimed wood beams as seats. With great lighting (a mix of natural and store-bought) and brick walls, this place is like a sexy sexy loft that happens to sell great coffee.As I write the review, I go back and forth on the music. Sometimes it's great. Currently being played? Spin Doctors, which isn't even good ironically. But, that's why Jesus gave us headphones, right? Still, I can't help but think that a consistently solid music program would make this place the abso-frickin-lutely best coffee shop on the planet. I approve."}, {"review_id": "42y9rhr4CR9-T4_wJKdWOw", "user_id": "Wqi04NdRUq4TvTVwIJ6q_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/8/2016", "text": "I really like this cafe. For some reason, Springfield has a large number of coffee shops per capita. I don't know what it is, but I guess y'all really like your coffee to be better than Folgers and Starbucks. I applaud it. Coffee Ethic offers great lattes, and decaf to boot! Their selection of pastries is simple, but they are of a high quality. I had a great white chocolate lemon muffin for breakfast the other day. The music can be a bit loud, but the wifi is fast and the seating is ample. The staff I've dealt with are all quite friendly too!"}, {"review_id": "rbZiY5L7IfAolD30GaP03A", "user_id": "uaipei2sxTJnwxn1GpB8YQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2017", "text": "Very cute local atmosphere and wonderful service!
