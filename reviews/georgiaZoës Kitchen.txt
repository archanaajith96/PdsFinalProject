For real, I ALWAYS want to eat here. For the longest time, I was pretty bummed that you couldn't get falafel here. I mean, are you really a Mediterranean joint if you don't have falafel? Which was fine because everything on the menu is delicious. BUT! I went in today and saw new menu items. FALAFEL! AT LAST!!! I was so excited that I wanted to get out of line and call my husband to tell him how this was the best day ever! Except he's in Ranger school and I can't talk to him so I went about my business. Today, I NEEDED the salmon pita. So I just ordered a falafel side.  THEY DIDNT HAVE ANY! Fortunately, I love this establishment and I just told the cashier \"then I guess I'll see you tomorrow.\"Let's talk about my salmon pita. It was MAGICAL! It was everything I needed it to be. So flavorful and spicy and the cabbage on it was sour and I loved it with all of my heart.Harissa. I put it on everything. I don't like red peppers. But I LOVE THIS HARISSA! Zoe's, thank you for making fresh, delicious, healthy food. You're amazing 99% of the time (because no one's perfect) and I always look forward to my next visit. I love you!Eat here!"}, {"review_id": "pIU8HT_2VnjizS6pyhTcng", "user_id": "zSjCj3R03Y2rSSUbvPNB_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I really enjoyed the Greek salad with chicken.

Note; don't come here during lunch if you're really hungry, my wait time was 25-35 minutes for a meal.  I was willing to wait and to my surprise it was worth it.  Food comes out fresh.  I ordered a steak kabob with pasta salad and roasted vegetables.

It's a favorite lunch spot (and sometimes dinner) when I'm in Columbus. It's actually good, reasonably healthy fast food. Well, you might consider it more of a \"fast casual\" place like Panera or Chipotle.They have good Greek/Mediterranean food like salads, kebobs, hummus, etc. Definitely different from other fast-casual places.My favorite is the very simple Greek salad and hummus plate. It comes with delicious tzatziki.This place is normally crowded at lunchtime but the line usually moves pretty quickly. They have an app where you can order ahead but I haven't tried it.Price-wise it's not cheap but comparable to Panera or Chipotle. Overall it's a good and popular lunch or light dinner spot.I wish we had one in Connecticut!"}, {"review_id": "M5MbwzNtkxh2pdmOli0CZg", "user_id": "YaGugQM5vxtpzsIXA24Sgw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2017", "text": "I use to eat here every weekend til end of 2016.

They litter the region's major cities and that's a good thing. It's a large chain known for quality and fresh food, great service and entrees that are largely healthy and you'll find that at the Columbus location. In fact, it's what there isn't much of in this area: fast food that tastes great, isn't fried, yet is affordable. And, sure we all love Bojangles, but less grease is good for the body and you're not going to find grease here or frozen and reheated foods.This particular location (I've been to about three dozen of their stores nationwide, maybe a few more, actually) excels at providing friendly service in a clean atmosphere. I'm sure you are wondering why come here rather than the other dozens of restaurants in the area and we all know there's a ton although most are poor quality chains.  We come for several reasons. Zoes serves much different food that you'd expect in this area. Another factor to consider is everything is made fresh, from scratch, on site - daily. The food is brought in every morning, prepped and served fresh. Yes, we did say fresh, every day. Where else can you find that from a fast-food type chain? You can't. Think Newk's - but way better. The biggest obstacle to overcome at Zoes is what to order. There's so many tasty items on the menu it's hard to choose one. Normally, we start with the Hummus Trio. It comes with regular, basil pesto and red pepper hummus, all of which are amazing. Keep in mind, they make this on site, daily - a fact that's obvious with each bite. And, there's cool, crisp, veggies to dip, too. As for entrees, we enjoy all of them, but are partial to the Chicken Roll Ups, Beef and Chicken Kabobs, Greek Chicken Marinara and Tossed Greek Salad. On the other hand, there's nothing on the menu that doesn't reach your table cooked to perfection, well seasoned, fresh and with a friendly smile.Zoes is ideal for couples, families, young adults and children. There's something that was made in house for everyone and packed with enough flavor to keep you coming back. It's a fast food chain that doesn't taste like fast food."}, {"review_id": "7OvW7ea5pmCKdl4SOta4jg", "user_id": "yxOnboYmKZZwuxVS2SLX5w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/21/2016", "text": "First time trying this Zoe's location. I ordered the shrimp kabobs. The shrimp and veggies were burnt...completely charred. I called the store and spoke to a manager who offered a \"recovery card\" to use the next time I placed an order. A kind gesture. However, the cook that prepared this order knew full well that she burned my food but instead of doing the right thing and cooking another order she cowardly put this food in a box and handed it to the cashier who bagged it. I would advise everyone purchasing to go orders from this location to open your box and CHECK YOUR FOOD!"}, {"review_id": "qdXRPsts263sL8j_XMNNcw", "user_id": "esSfLFeuQao7Uir-wnZcTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "My favorite place to get a quick bite to eat.

Management and workers are downright friendly as soon as you walk in the door and not that creepy I don't know who the neighbor is next door friendly. They just are genuinely friendly and happy that you are dining at their establishment. They have a wide selection of Mediterranean food to include three different types of hummus, Greek salad with homemade dressing made in house, vegetarian dishes, chicken dishes and the list goes on. I have to say what stood out to me the most was the steak kabobs. Oh my goodness. The steak was juicy, moist... Perfect. But that wasn't even the best part the seasoning made the steak the best thing on the menu. I don't know what they season the steak with... Some type of marinade but Wow... I don't know of a place in Columbus that serves a better steak. It was almost a shame to eat this off of a kebab. I wanted to come in and eat of full steak off of a plate. Overall this place is amazing, healthy, fresh and they offer free Wi-Fi. To top that off the customer service is on point. Everyone should try Zoes kitchen. I'll definitely be back for some steak.

I would not try this Zoes again. Not on a plane, not on a train, not with a sheep, really, really never.  Thursday night - four of us went in looking for vegetarian, which Zoes has. People were very nice. We ordered. We sat down. Half an hour later, we had no food. Waiting...waiting...... There were an awful lot of people staring at the counter with varying degrees of hopefullness.  Finally, a very polite woman came out. She brought three plates of food. Did I mention, there were four of us?  She said she'd bring the other plate. All three plates were....cold.  The three with food, cold food, although most of it wasn't supposed to be cold, started eating. Eventually I said \"Well. If you guys get DONE...I suppose I'd rather just have my money back!\"  So two out of the three with cold food, that wasn't really supposed to be cold, started eating slower. Since my food never, ever did arrive, my husband eventually went up and asked for our money back. He had to wait a few minutes at the counter because there was another lady asking for her money back. They apologized, and told him they were out of the potato salad I had ordered, so they didn't make my food. WERE THEY WAITING FOR MORE POTATOES TO GROW?!  They had a line of food at the counter. The (really very polite) woman was walking around, looking in various take out containers, trying to figure out whose food was whose, and what went with what bill, and what was supposed to go together.  They had no system for this. They politely adjusted our bill, we stuffed out trash from the cold (wasn't supposed to be cold) food in the overflowing trash - I'm not really sure why it was overflowing because there had been a young man over there opening the trash and doing something but apparently it wasn't emptying the trash because it was really, really full - and we left. The food choices looked like they might be good. I really have no idea if the food is good or not, because the people who did get food didn't get hot food, and I didn't get any food.  So...I wouldn't exactly recommend this location of Zoes, even though the people who work there really are very polite."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/zo%C3%ABs-kitchen-columbus-3?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
