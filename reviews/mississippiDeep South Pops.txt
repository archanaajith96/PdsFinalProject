The friendly and nice cashier helped us pick out the perfect deep South pop to try, the Creole cream cheesecake.Creole cream cheesecake pop - VERY creamy, VERY delicious. Like biting into a literal cheesecake, except only 3 times as flavorful and rich than an actual cheesecake. Wonderfully rich and inviting, it hit the spot perfectly for two weary travelers in need of some comfort food (in the form of a popsicle). Usually I don't go for popsicles because they are sometimes harsh to bite into, having the harsh grating chill of an icicle, but the texture of their popsicle was nice and smooth, melting in out mouths gracefully.Deep South Pops is nice place to stop by for some delicious treats! I imagine this place must be exploding with customers during the summer. Friendly staff, nice clean ambience inside, and great popsicles. I highly recommend coming here to try out a deep South pop!"}, {"review_id": "AS8ab6oZAHRmyoBu-UxTLA", "user_id": "3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "Coffee. Booze. Pops. Jenga. I'm in! This adorable, bright, welcoming, industrial chic space is home to Deep South Pops which serves up some tasty house made pops in unique dairy and non dairy flavors....I went for the 'Sangria' which was perfectly red wine and fresh fruit flavored. The friendly guys behind the counter suggested I order a Sprite to dip it into. I was a little hesitant being a non soda drinker, but I figured I would try it anyway. Verdict: What a novel idea! It was awesome and a perfect, fun complement to my treat. The kiddos enjoyed watching my soda change colors as I dipped and sipped, and I loved the new taste my beverage took on. The pop never fell and held its own even while being submerged.Kiddos went for cookies and cream and strawberry buttermilk flavors. They loved both of these creamy pops! There was the option to drizzle or cover in chocolate and add sprinkles also. This spot also offer a full cafe menu with cold brews, nitro, drip coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, tea and espresso. Many patrons choose to dip their cool treat right into their hot cup! Ooooh! A half a dozen mostly local brews on tap. Some gelato flavors, a few pastries such as croissants and muffins and some super food health bars to go also. Vegan and Gluten Free friendly. Lovely area up front with exposed brick, a comfy couch, a farmhouse table and oversized pom pom decorations which I LOVED. Some folks were getting work done up there. The area to the rear looks like a converted garage with bright glass floor to ceiling windows, brightly colored barstool and bistro tables. Jenga was available on the tables which the kiddos enjoyed a few rounds of. Great stop! Perfect for a mom with littles. They leave sugared up and you leave caffeinated with energy to deal with them. *Full parking lot around back with a rear entrance for easy access."}, {"review_id": "lEBhBh3A9xCfmdb5WEZGiQ", "user_id": "gKUmc1FckEyAl_txeos4zA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "I had an avocado coconut cream popsicle and it was amazing.

Who knew these two pair so well together?! Obviously, Deep South Pops did! What a unique combination! There is such a variety of coffee and popsicles here that there's something for everyone to try! They handcraft all their pops in-house using primarily locally sourced ingredients and their coffee is locally roasted. They offer dairy and non-dairy options. I'm in the midst of a cross-country road trip so I was just passing through, but if I were local, this would be my regular spot!"}, {"review_id": "46ZNG0ofM9zOtGuzG8Sk-Q", "user_id": "8v3fSLa0GeynPcrz9UELIw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Nice place!

In my personal opinion if you are going there and they have the cookies and creme or the cookie buzz pop you have to get one if they have both (first you must celebrate the fact that you are now officially a unicorn i can rarely ever catch them with cookie buzz let alone cookie buzz and cookies and creme)  if you don't mind the caffeine go for the cookie buzz its a combo of the cookies and creme and the cappuccino pops and i don't like coffee but I like this. also all of their non dairy pops are super fresh and its great!

As a first time MS visitor, I checked out the old houses around Belhaven and this was right by the Welty house. My first trip was the one around the Belhaven district and there, I ordered the creole cheesecake popsicle along with a hazelnut mocha. Separate, they were both equally good, but together... MIND EFFING GOOD!!!  It made me sad cuz I knew I'd never have it again once I go home. That's how good it was, folks. So good, it put me in a depressive state just thinking about not having it again. My second trip was the one next to the highway. This one is a much smaller location and their options seemed narrow. This time I got a caramel latte and the buttermilk popsicle. Safe choice. Safe taste. It wasn't bad by any means. It just didn't make me wanna slap myself. This place is probably better for kids too since there's a kids play place right outside along with a quaint little patio area."}, {"review_id": "BeLUPNwPpOVnCQfzApRTIA", "user_id": "82Micw6atbqgn8-r7oNRKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "About to try some great ice cream pops.

Always a fun stop on a nice day. There's something here for whoever you bring. Having the ice cream and gelato make it a more family-friendly shop than the traditional coffee house. Also, I LOVE cold brew and they sell it for a lot less than other local places. The baristas are friendly and the vibe is always great. There's seating both in and outside. Plus, you might get to catch them actually making popsicles since that's viewable in the back. I've been here for a date, with fam, with friends, or just to study- Deep South Pops works for all of it."}, {"review_id": "xyRG3IedTp6bhNIB90ub8A", "user_id": "SgvfwmxxK6p0stIDaV4tYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/2/2017", "text": "You wouldn't think a popsicle place would be that impressive but I got the cheesecake pop and wow!
