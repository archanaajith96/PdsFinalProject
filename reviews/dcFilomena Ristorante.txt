The surroundings were intriguingly comfortable, with a wide open view of the kitchen. Do make reservation! it's definitely is a popular place.I would judge that,at least during the week, it is frequented more by an adult crowd"}, {"review_id": "vx-XmpPZRwxwXsX1Y4ReGQ", "user_id": "12dsLdRZ6FnADA9gA803zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I have been to Filomena on three separate occasions now, and this is always my spot of choice when I want a nice Italian dinner in Georgetown. I have had the Linguini Cardinale, Carbonara, and Veal Parmigiana. Every single one of them have been delicious. Definitely among the best Italian dishes I've had. The lobster cardinale sauce that comes in the linguini dish is to die for, so creamy with bursting lobster flavor and notes of sherry popping through. There are also huge chunks of lobster in the dish, I can tell they don't skimp out there. The carbonara while classic was also delicious. The veal is phenomenal--and at 40oz you definitely can't complain about the portion. Perfectly crisp, juicy, and tender...everything you'd expect from a quality piece of veal. The portions on each of these dishes is enormous so you can definitely split a dish or take at least half home to have another day. The pricing for the dishes is up there, averaging around $30-$50 per dish. But you get so much quality food it is definitely worth it. You also get a complimentary glass of sambuca or amaretto at the end of the meal which is very nice. The ambiance inside is very traditional and dimly lit. You are really packed in there so if you like having a ton of space this may not be for you. I also highly, highly recommend making a reservation if you want to eat without a lengthy wait.This is a great Italian spot in Georgetown and I will continue to come here for special occasions."}, {"review_id": "JWlkoXP9CTeLbwbu_xKLdQ", "user_id": "s5FMlSB4QBTX75K1wDHJiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "A little gem that feels like a movie set in Georgetown. The place is busy so get a reservation. Upon walking in you see a display case of these desserts that make your mouth water and eyes drawn in amazement at their size and beauty! They look so good you have no idea which you want for after dinner. We were seated shortly and greeted by a very nice waiter. The wine list was extensive and and we made our selection. We were brought a basket of bread and a oil with spice and olive mixture that was delicious. While we waited for our appetizer. Our appetizer was the the fried buffalo mozzarella with Sunday sauce. It was served with a creamy white sauce that was similar to a bechamel and then a side of the Sunday red. It was unique and absolutely delicious!!!!!So much so, that if I didn't have more food coming and wasn't eyeing that dessert case I would have ordered more...lolMental note for next time!For dinner my husband ordered the sausage with rigatoni dish. He said the sauce on it absolutely made that dish! Only thing it needed was a little spice. He added a little crushed red pepper that the waiter brought and it was perfect for him. I had the eggplant parmigiana! It was extremely unique. It was unlike anything I had had previously so at first I was a little hesitant but I tasted it and the flavors were delicious! The eggplant was probably one of the best I have had! My only complaint was on the penne. It seemed like the sauce was different. It was lighter and more runny than any of the others that we had that night. I would have preferred the Sunday sauce on it then whatever was on it, because it wasn't very flavorful especially up next to that eggplant parmigiana. For dessert we had the cannoli and tiramisu both of which are absolutely huge and so delicious that you can't stop eating them!!!  If you live near by I don't know how you couldn't be here weekly just for these pastries alone..... Hands down they have to be some of the best desserts EVER!! I don't think you should leave here without trying this unique spin on the cannoli. It has a brittle like shell with the cannoli filling in these layers. I may be craving this for weeks after I leave. I have to say this was a wonderful experience and we will be back. If you are looking for a romantic quiet evening this may not be your place. Keep in mind Italian's are not quite.... I know... I am Greek and Italian. Yet, if you want to see someone's grandma making pasta in the front window ( no joke) and eating fabulous food, this is where you go!!!

It was suggested by my soon to be mother in law, so I was hoping for the best. When we arrived, a women at the front wasn't really welcoming. When we mentioned we didn't have a reservation, her response was \"we'll be right with you\", and completely ignored us. Good thing the manager took care of us and sea us immediately after asking if we had a reservation. Anyway moving on, our server was great which completely made up for the poor service at the beginning. The complimentary bread was really delicious, soft and warm combine it with olive oil and parmesan cheese, I swear I could have only that. The menu is pretty stacked, but I end up choosing the Agnolotti Alla Panna, which is Ravioli stuffed with Italian cheese and sautéed spinach tossed in light Parmesan cream sauce. It's was good, it wasn't something exquisite but decent. I personally believe I'd have to comeback here again and try something else. I was also told that lunch is better than dinner, which made me a bit curious."}, {"review_id": "KRMntJ7ZjJu267oZeT4l3g", "user_id": "6BZMGaiBMQSZ639VfjbVaA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "I agree with a lot of the folks on Yelp when it comes to the cost of Filomena Ristorante. It is sooooo expensive, and I really don't understand why? I mean, the food is tasty, and I was able to see the woman who makes the pasta up front, but I'm really shocked at the idea of paying almost $50 for a bowl of pasta. I should have gotten some gold flakes with my food.Aside from the price, the service was so slow when we were first seated. I was waiting a good 15 minutes before being introduced to my host. We didn't even get water until a few minutes after that. Service is very important to me, and I felt as though Filomena could have been better about that.Also, they called me during work hours to confirm my reservation. I tried calling them back and the number wouldn't work. Then when I finally got a person to answer she put me on hold for a while. It's a little obnoxious to have to be put on hold after trying to call back a million times. I called early enough too- NOT during rush hour by any means.Not sure if I can afford to come back. $45 pasta meals to me are really absurd, no matter how good the pasta can be."}, {"review_id": "oeChMcfALrzFdQJLVx29-g", "user_id": "z-_GwpGMpBipw9wrefE_BA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Been wanting to try Filomenas for quite sometime, my friends are always raving about this place but could never get a reservation over the weekends. So while in GT sight seeing with my bff we decided to try filomenas. We went down a few steps to the reception area and felt like Alice in wonderland going down the rabbit hole. The restaurant was overwhelmingly decorated for Easter. Pastel colored flowers, eggs and giant stuffed rabbits everywhere. It's was visual overload anywhere you go in the restaurant, even the restrooms. It could have been real whimsical if it weren't overdone. We were seated pronto and ordered burata (can never go wrong) cheese ravioli,  eggplant dish, both were huge portions. Nothing note worthy, if anything the pasta was a tad aldente for me. We also shared a slice of mix fruit cheesecake, took less than two minutes for us finish a humongous piece. The fruits were fresh and cheesecake itself was light and oh so creamy. I should have ordered more to take home. The dessert selection was overwhelming, I wanted to order one of everything but my stomach was going to explode if I inhale another whiff of the cheesecake. I'll definitely come back especially during Christmas season, our server said it took only 2 weeks to decorate for Easter and 6 weeks for Christmas so I'm curious to see what the restaurant is going to look."}, {"review_id": "dbSEPJVMR_j_pnCaVSXP1Q", "user_id": "fVYsvmIvYr5-oop5Psz2hQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Filomena is the best Italian food i have ever had...I don't even know where to begin because I'm still trying to process what I just ate.

I had the rice balls as an appetizer - unique and SO YUMMY and I didn't realize how good tomato sauce could be (called Sunday Sauce on the menu. For the main entree my boyfriend and I shared two pasta dishes- the lobster linguini and the braised brisket ravioli...YES BRAISED BRISKET RAVIOLI. I could cry tears of joy.

I had visitors in D.C. for the past 3 weeks so I've been eating here once every week for 3 weeks. I must say their misto de mare is now probably my favorite dish. It was so freaking good and filled with seafood: scallops, mussels, clams, shrimp. If you are a seafood lover and like linguini in red sauce and juicy seafood this is it. Died and gone to seafood heaven. Now this review is based on my 3rd time there ^ We were also seated by some tables from Boston and they were real fun. _________________________________________________Changing this to 4 stars based on my second experience there, which wasn't as good as the first. Ordered the lobster linguini again, but this time the noodles were way too hard. I noticed it first and my mom agreed. Then my dad came a little later and tried it and brought it up as well. Told the server who said it was \"al dente\" supposed to be hard. But it was more like undercooked hard and makes your jaw super tired to chew. He offered to take it back to fix. When it came back it was super salty. But we didn't want to make any more fuss over it. So kind of disappointing. Not as perfect as the first time.  I made another reservation for Saturday for my friend who is visiting, but I changed my mind. Gonna try something different."}, {"review_id": "t0wt_xw0PMyZj31Zc-S2UA", "user_id": "c6eUCvE_QRVvdqu66l2_Qg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I really wanted to like this place because all the raves I heard prior to dining here. However, all I can say is that this place is a tourist trap. I definitely had better Italian food for a cheaper price in the area. Reservations: It's not easy to get a reservation. You have to reserve at least 2-3 weeks advanced for a table. Decor: The decor is very tacky. Sure, people say that's a unique feature of the restaurant, but all I see is a really old restaurant that has not been updated since it's opened. And it looks very messy in my opinion. Service: Not consistent. Our appetizer came out very fast, but our entrees did not come out nearly as fast nor come out together. It was also difficult to get our waiter's attention throughout our meal. Food: It's not bad, but it's not great either. I ordered the Vongole pasta, and the rest of my table ordered a chicken ravioli dish, carbonara pasta, and misto di mare. They all tasted as it should, but nothing really stood out. I probably could make the dish or go to a cheaper restaurant to get the same taste (or better). There wasn't a dish that I wanted come back for. Also, if the menu description does not say \"homemade pasta\", don't assume that the pasta is made in-house. Overall, I probably won't be going back any time soon. You're not missing out by not dining here."}, {"review_id": "wZplVNahebO4xPte1SJ_8Q", "user_id": "26Sk5bdxsnVk4sXUd8rShg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "This dim-lit and cozy Georgetown spot is a great place for a date or to bring your family.

That, along with the bread and pesto that they gave us as a complimentary starter, had stuffed us up before we got our lasagna and seafood pasta. We picked them both up to go.Lastly, we finished off with a dark chocolate and an Oreo mousse cake. They were so rich that we ordered a coffee on the side to gulp it down.

The restaurant was located right across the street of Pinstripes in Georgetown. It was actually downstairs so you need to take some stairs first. We were seated quickly and were offered the menu. I chose the sausage, seafood lasagna, and double chocolate cake. My husband went for the meatball, traditional lasagna, and cookie and cream cake. The portion is huge! You can see people taking bags home due to the large portion. We ended up with plenty and almost had a food coma afterwards.It is a traditional Italian restaurant with lots of carbs, pasta, meat sauce, meat, and more meat! The ambiance was intimate and nice.

We had a reservation and were seated right away. If you do not have a reservation for dinner, be prepared to wait. Ambiance: The restaurant was quite noisy and it was difficult to hear the conversation at times. If you are in a large group, get a circular table as it's easier to hear each other. Currently, the decorations are for Valentine's day, so the mood is pretty romantic. Pricing: The dishes are expensive, but huge, so you will certainly have leftovers or can split with another person.Food: I chose the Linguini Cardinale, President Clinton's favorite dish. Plenty of moist, flavorful lobster meat drowning in a thick, creamy lobster sauce. Unfortunately, there was lobster shell in my pasta, and that's why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.

As it was a 1 pm seating, I informed the family that we would only be eating salads and appetizers and would go for the \"big, Christmas Eve dinner\" later that evening. Boy, was I naive. The restaurant was only serving its dinner menu on this day, but even so, we still figured we would \"eat light\" in anticipation on our formal evening meal.While this is not a family style Italian restaurant, our server allowed us to share two appetizers, three entrees, cocktails, a bottle of wine and a dessert amongst the five of us--and we still brought home leftovers! The appetizers were as big as entrees and the entrees and dessert were twice the size of plates elsewhere. And it was GOOD! I mean really, really GOOD! Even my Italian husband, who rarely ever wants to eat Italian out because it can never quite measure up to his family's meals, was impressed and eager to go back. Service was top notch as well. As you can imagine, it was super busy on Christmas Eve, but our server (Alberto? I'm so bad with names...) was attentive and never once made us feel forgotten. We aren't an easy bunch and he remained jovial, informative and helpful throughout the whole meal. Afterward, the restaurant offers complimentary Sambuca and Amaretto. My daughter missed out on it because she was walking around looking at decorations. So when Dino, the manager, came around to greet guests, she asked him if she could have some. He immediately brought two fresh bottles to the table. Classy.This restaurant has the old school charm and manners that newer restaurants lack.
