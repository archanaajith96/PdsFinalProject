I actually prefer Tiger Den in Chinatown but I hate driving out there and also waiting outside, so I come here as an alternate but I ain't even mad cause it's just as yummy! Parking is convenient because there is a garage behind the restaurant, and it's FREE. I've never had an issue finding parking in the garage, but I've also only eaten here during lunch hours which probably aren't as busy as dinner.As I mentioned before, I've only eaten here for lunch and the wait has never taken so long to the point where I feel myself getting impatient or worse - hangry!! (Which of course my boyfriend can appreciate very much.) Customer service has always been great as well. The servers are knowledgable about the dishes and can recommend items based on your preferences. I mean, you could just read the menu but I like asking about the most popular dishes since most ramen places have somewhat of a speciality.I like the Spicy Chicken Ramen, which I guess is one of their popular bowls because there's a big fat picture of it on the menu and not all bowls have a picture. (You go Glen Coco!) I also love ordering the curry rice. I looove Japanese curry, but I'll only order it if I know I can share it with someone else because I can't finish both dishes by myself. You can definitely get filled up here, which I know sometimes isn't achievable with noodles.I would most definitely recommend this place for you ramen lovers!"}, {"review_id": "rpS60bECISmbGhXlG0NhKQ", "user_id": "dZ17_lxE72oeYguQ_iBvaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "It's been a while since my wife and I went on a date.I had seen this place on yelp and knew I wanted us to try it.we got there around 8pm and it wasn't that bad.everyone i.e the staff was friendly.we grabbed some drinks while we waited for the table.Blue moon and Long Island iced tea for my wife and I respectively.It was our first ramen noodle experience hence my review will be limited.anyways I got the pork ramen noodle with an extra egg,and she got the chefs special a spicy chicken ramen noddle with seaweed.Its our to go to place for ramen noodles for now."}, {"review_id": "azWjdzfkmgsR_4pXUawnHg", "user_id": "goS1yClqQv6ZB4q_aH-Dww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great ramen, but it's often so busy that the wait can be waaay too long.

What surprised me in particular is that in the heart of houston of all places I would find one of the best ramen broths I have had in a long time. The black tonkotsu with fresh garlic on the side had these thick noodles and succulent broth that left me wanting more. The soup base was a little fatty so if that isnt your thing check out their chicken ramen instead which I heard from my coworker was incredible as well. They have a heaping amount of toppings like ginger and bamboo shoots but what impressed me was how tender the chasu pork was. The only bummer was that they're only a few pieces of meat.  The chicken wings here were kind of a bust and crazy small though... Just stick to the ramen when coming to JINYA! Pro tip: Be sure to ask for an extra egg too. The flavored eggs here are awesome."}, {"review_id": "KUGsALGADOnooneZTKXiRQ", "user_id": "nWxor12uSy5MryaJK28CSA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Are you hip? Do you zig when others zag? Do you pronounce t swift t swizzle. Have you been called a hipster..self proclaimed isn't the same. When you see the sign from the street it looks low key. You even walk in and see the \"please wait to be seated sign\" and you remain oblivious to what you're about to experience. I felt like I walked into a modern day speakeasy, when I crossed the threshold of bar to restaurant. While there isn't anything illegal about selling ramen, the vibe is a throwback to a more intimate setting with 2 huge large open tables filling the space. Scattered around you can find more traditional seating. Now let's talk ramen. I've had my fair share from cup noodles, to nongshim shin ramyun. A self made ramen expert. I got the spicy umami miso ramen soup. The website says ramen is all about the broth..and the broth was pretty amazing. The flavor has many layers, and it leaves you feeling satisfied after every mouthful. The noodles itself were pretty average, but I think the broth definitely makes the dish. You get a good size bowl and surprisingly the add ons are a decent price. My only real complaint is their levels of spicy really not being that spicy. I'd be nice if they expanded that scale so hot actually meant hot. When you come here get ready for more than likely the best ramen you can find in Houston. The vibe adds a lot to the experience, and it brings a lot of Houston to an authentic Japanese dish. For the dopest crowd in Houston be sure to give it a shot."}, {"review_id": "BhR8n327XVarauhyFMQOCA", "user_id": "fI6fPp2YMq76LS350Qc2OA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "The best ramen so far on my radar. We do not have ramen like this in San Antonio.  We stopped in around 7:30 on a Friday it was busy but you could be seated at the bar faster with a party of 2. I would not recommend large party's unless y'all are willing to wait. They also have communal seating which quite interesting and cool. We were seated quickly at the bar right next to the kitchen which I loved watching the process of how they prepare their ramen. They turn out bowls very quickly which is shocking for how much flavor it has.My boyfriend had their special which was pork with shrimp based broth. I had their jinya black and it was amazing! We ordered appetizers I would order their pork buns again the buns were so smooth and fluffy.  I highly recommend to stop and try!

Pros: I really appreciated that there was a garage where you can park free right at the corner of the restaurant. The restaurant itself was indeed more of a bar than a ramen house. There are screens playing sports and the background music was contemporary pop. However their ramen was definitely among the best ones I have ever had. We tried the regular spicy umami miso ramen and the vegan miso ramen. The broth for both was very creamy without being overly salty. The noodle itself was on the chewy side which I prefer. Cons: The day when I was there they ran out of Bok Choi which was a bummer and I was kind of annoyed that we weren't informed until I asked.  We sat at the bar table and the service was quite slow too. Their staff seemed to be overwhelmed by all the takeout orders. Otherwise I really like the ramen here and I will definitely visit JINYA again. Hopefully the Bok Choi will be in stock LOL."}, {"review_id": "-gN59k9Al5WgheJqz5v97w", "user_id": "YPZ2PyHFvbgtgZol0YY0OA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I had high expectations for this place, because there was a whole hour and a half wait for dinner.

Both of us are SUCKERS for some good ramen! There are some decent ramen bars in NOLA, but Jinya was something a lot of people were raving about in Houston. Seriously.. what really had me super excited to eat here was when the hostess walked us in and we were greeted by the kitchen staff and servers. That got me smiling and laughing like crazy and I knew I was going to be in for a treat. The place looked wonderful and I wish I would've eaten in the middle of the restaurant where the rocks were. The menu looked very nice and a good amount of ramen was offered! The spice levels were I believe milk, spicy, hot, Inferno 1, and Inferno 2. The inferno spice levels I believe weren't shown in the menu, you had to ask. The server was very sweet and she knew a lot about the menu when I had questions. Always attentive and wanted to make sure our first time was great.I got the Black Tonkotsu ramen while my girlfriend had the Sprouting up Ramen. She got spicy and I got the hot level of spice. I have a pretty high spice tolerance, and the 3rd level (Hot) spice was just perfect! It wasn't too spicy where it was not enjoyable, but spicy enough to always have a kick in each spoonful you eat! She and I also loooove Takoyaki (octopus balls) everywhere we go, and this place just nailed it! I really couldn't complain about anything being here, although I wish I had the shrimp balls A LOT of people talked about. If you're in Houston and love ramen, this place is a MUST! I will be coming back here whenever I have the chance."}, {"review_id": "WCIP-k61rU31S1r8ocYLjQ", "user_id": "5WiR90Af3ru32ctRbtAEgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Overall a very good restaurant. My husband and I decided to have a lunch date here since my brother-in-law and his girlfriend are big fans of it. When we arrived to the establishment, we saw numerous people waiting to be seated. However, when we told the hostess that it was was just two people in our party, we were seated right away. I'm guessing that the people waiting were for three or more. As soon as we sat down, our waitress asked us for our drink orders and soon afterwards asked for our entree requests. I decided on the Tonkatsu Black with the chicken karate and salad sides while my husband opted for the pork chashu. I enjoyed my choice. My husband liked his but thought that his meal was a little salty. In conclusion, this is a good place for Japanese ramen. Although not my favorite, I left satisfied and happy.

After coming here a few times at both locations, it has become my favorite ramen place in town. Parking is limited in the area, but there is a garage parking around the corner. Expect a wait if you come during their peak time. If you don't want to wait then come on a weekday around the afternoon. On weekends especially for dinner, the wait is about 15-30min. My favorite ramen is the Jinya Black tonkotsu. You can choose your level of mild, spicy, or hot. Portion is good. I like the thin ramen noodles they use with a whole egg. Broth is always creamy and flavored just right. I chose spicy and it was a good amount of spiciness. Their hot level isn't too spicy either. If you want something lighter than their sprouting up ramen is a good choice. Plenty of brussels sprouts in your ramen. Some appetizers that good are the tempura brussel sprouts, taiyaki, and their mini salmon poke taco. However, I would skip the salmon sashimi. It had a mushy taste. Staff is always friendly. Services were fast. Ramen was brought out quickly despite the place was packed. They have booth seats, bar seats, and community tables. The interiors were trendy with low lightings. Their happy hour is 3pm-5pm. Overall, definitely one of the best ramen place in town."}, {"review_id": "W6aY2sMTMaK_I054YUDsKQ", "user_id": "gHpV1umrCi4AfKvmMBPXYQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Jinya is definitely my most favorite ramen restaurant!

I've lived in Japan and have sampled ramen shops from Kyushu to Kanto, there is indeed a depth of flavor, or in other words, level of \"umami\" that is missing in JINYA. For example, Tiger Den can achieve this level but I highly suspect they use excessive \"MSG\".  Jinya is not at that level yet. Neither is the \"acclaimed\" Ramen Tatsuya. Whether their soup base is not boiled long enough or whether it's their ingredients, their broth is not \"umami\" enough. The Tonkotsu black is the closest to achieve this because of the garlic. Go to Ramen Ichi and go to to Jinya and count how many Japanese customers are there. Japanese will go out of their way to a restaurant that is more authentic. While the owner may have good intentions, he should learn that operating a Japanese restaurant should teach you about being humble. I bet if JINYA was not in the downtown location they would just be skating by like Ramen Jin. You can appease the masses, and maybe that works for your business model. But do not disrespect the true ramen enthusiasts."}, {"review_id": "GihA-NYydRoNdk35_GWlEA", "user_id": "KaNUwYzn2_FlVCFWMh1KVw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I heard this place was great compare to ramen bar ichi so I have it a try...The first time there, I was seated in the far back in front of the kitchen. Service was good and attentive even when it was busy for lunch time. I order a cha cha ramen that is for garlic lover. When I got my ramen, I try the soup and couldn't taste any garlic nor a good broth. It was a disappointment. The flavor was passable for this type of ramen. I gave this a second chance because my boyfriend hadn't try this place before. We went on valentines and was seated within 20-30mins. Service was passable this time because our server was nowhere to be found when we needed something. We decided on the special which was the Tokyo ramen with a salad, fried chicken and fried dumpling. The dumpling wasn't that great, a little oily for me. However the fried chickens were surprisingly delicious compare to anything else we had. It was cut into large pieces and fried. It has a juice inside and goes well with the sauce. The salad had a weird dressing that doesn't go too well. Our ramen was decent, nothing spiral about it, the egg was like any other egg you can get at ramen shops. The noodle was too soft and fat for my preference but my friends states that she like it here better. My overall verdict is it's a passable place for decent ramen. However, I wouldn't make it a frequent place for my ramen. I will stick to my spicy ramen at ramen bar ichi. But if you haven't try it yet, maybe give it a chance! It might fit your taste more than4/2018 Came here recently with a friend because we wanted ramen after class. Every other ramen shop was close but this one. We both got a medium spicy Tonkotsu ramen with an egg. The service was great, but the ramen was ok. The egg was over cook that the yolk was mostly chalky. The meat was fatty and they were small. The soup base wasn't flavorful or gave a good kick. It just taste like fatty and spicy seasoning. I do like the mint they have, overall it's a decent meal."}, {"review_id": "EA7e2BLYTm8FqAtACDBKpg", "user_id": "mxSO5bFo_XaV6XlLXMM-yA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "There is no shortage of Asian restaurants in Houston. Today was a good day to try one of the many since we had some time to make a pass at one of them in Midtown Houston en route to Galveston to catch our cruise. We were the first customers at 10:58 AM on a Sunday and it opens at 11am every day.  In 20 minutes half the restaurant filled with Ramen-hungry customers like us.  And in 40 minutes, every seat in the House was taken.  The street construction was obviously not a deterrent; which tells me two things-Jinya brings in the Houston locals that live close and love eating here AND this place MUST serve really great food. True on both.Now you can pick the specials, or your can build a ramen bowl-noodle, protein, and broth.  Today's choices that the 3 of us shared was the recommended popular, Sprouting up Ramen; delicious in my book, although the thicker noodles do fill you up quickly and the brussel  sprouts are a bonus. The other dishes shared, JINYA Tonkotsu Black, which they were happy to sub the thin noodles on my request, and the JINYA signature bun.  Delicious all around and service was attentive.  Nice surprise to see vegan options such as Vegetable broth or spinach noodlesWill gladly dine again and try something new when in the area and get their friendly greeting \"Hey!\" that's hollered throughout the restaurant by the entire kitchen staff to EVERY customer coming in to eat.  It sure is a nice signature Asian style of Howdy Y'all."}, {"review_id": "mcbTRzqStlyHGN90XUNQ8g", "user_id": "xEmDY94P2YO33zZIx1PJKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Always order the Cha Cha Cha w/ extra garlic.  Their eggs are not consistent.
