It seemed a little dirty which was unpleasant, and the food was bland. I had the veggie burrito and substituted the eggs for black beans. It was ok, but really basic. It was not seasoned very well. Also the salsa is came with was really not very good, so I just used hot sauce. The veggies inside were good but the potatoes were not. The banana bread French toast was a little better. The fresh fruit was nice. The French toast itself was really eggy and could have done with some cinnamon and another minute in the pan. Also, it would have tasted better with butter rather than syrup in my opinion. I wouldn't come here again honestly. If you're looking for a good breakfast in Missoula, you should try Catalyst."}, {"review_id": "YiASm5LtpO0uDWKhs9nkQA", "user_id": "P4CEb2L_O1V0zS3mbjyOKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "I love this place.

The food is absolutely amazing, the staff very friendly, and we received our food very quickly. We have some food allergies, and not only did their staff member not blink an eye when I mentioned this, she also suggested that they could add vegan black bean burger to my burrito. It was delicious! We ordered the veggie browns, veggie burrito (with the aforementioned black bean burger), and French toast. The only reason I didn't give them a full 5 stars is that the place is crowded. So, so crowded, to the point that it's difficult to carry on a conversation. We were interrupted multiple times by people asking for us to move our chairs (by no fault of their own).

Yelp did it's job once more by sending me and my wife to this small Missoula staple that provides quality and affordable breakfast and lunch to UM students. We ordered the Seared Ahi BLT and the Corned Beef Sandwich (both part of the lunch menu) and had a hard time trying to decide which one's better! I say Corned Beef just because it's a +75 year old recipe and I really can't remember the last time I had that good of corned beef anywhere else. There are many other equally delicious options (you can easily tell by swiping over other Yelpers' pictures). Best of all this quality breakfast/lunch is extremely affordable! One of the best \"value\" meals I've ever had. The place itself is small so it looks like it can get crowded quickly (as it did during our visit) but service is quick to respond and friendly. If in Missoula, do yourself a favor and stop by Hob Nob at least once, you won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "dNyMm1UA-q39jSh9i-qo9Q", "user_id": "mFYM-Z2aCOw0eKb3Y_aJ1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "As mentioned the dine in area is fairly small yet so is the menu.
