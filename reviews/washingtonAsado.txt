I ordered the chicken fried chicken and my friend ordered the seared scallops. The drinks where amazing as well. I will be back to try more items on the menu especially those seared scallops. I also like the interior design of the place. The design helped my forget about the others in the restaurant and focus on my friend. I came in for lunch and the service was great, but the place was relatively empty so maybe my experience was boosted by lack of customers demanding their time and energy. Next time I will be sure to check out the place during dinner so I can have a better idea of their service."}, {"review_id": "Gul6APeQr80IGi-pR1dVVA", "user_id": "NfV6MfCbMm7hnF3t-I8nbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "If you're looking to splurge a little, this is a great date night spot! (We went for our anniversary) The ambience is nice! We ordered the Mediterranean Mules (they have fig vodka) and they were SO good, probably the best mule I've had! We also ordered the beef & lamp empanadas, and those with the 2 sauces were amazing as well. I guess we're not used to expensive-ish places because we were a little surprised there were only 2 (ha) but I'd still recommend them! We both had the Puerco Relleno and that was to die for as well (stuffed with melted Beecher's cheese, bacon & jalapeños...omg amazing). The bread with the cheese spread & balsamic in the beginning was a nice touch as well.The only thing I'd say is we were a little surprised with the high prices of the entrees (drinks & appetizers seemed reasonable) and I'd suggest to get a table away from the door-there's a big curtain around it so it creates a big gust every time the door opens & closes. We didn't make a reservation and got a table just fine (Thursday evening), but it seemed like it would be a good idea to have one."}, {"review_id": "0sOU3MBE_rfzpyNQAtyA-g", "user_id": "jzhjYYS8TGYqvzD4_buW0Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Ate here tonight for the second time, this time for Easter. We dined in a group of four, and ordered 4 different entrees: The serrano-stuffed chicken, picatta de pollo, the quinoa cobb, and a spinach and kale salad with chicken and shrimp skewers. The last order was mine, which I requested without cranberries for the sake of an allergy. I also requested the dressing on the side, and it came out with both cranberries and dressing. I politely requested that-if it wasn't too much trouble-they fix it for me. The waitress was unfailingly polite and fixed it super fast- however, this time it came out without goat cheese. Other than my entrée being served incorrectly twice, everything was really good, and we'll likely be back."}, {"review_id": "mABpyeHZlUWcTsWEYsQDgQ", "user_id": "_yavBhjdgabqVecd-rAgIw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "My review is long overdo as we came here for our first time in October for restaurant week. First, let me just say that the food was excellent. We went with a party of 8 and were seated promptly. Everyone raved about the food and the drinks were excellent.....And then it happened. At the tail end of our meal, my completely hairless brother in law found a LONG BLACK HAIR that had been tucked in his food. It was torture to watch him literally pull it out from his throat and I'm sure all of our stomachs started to turn. I have to point out that there was no way possible this hair was from any of us. For one, the hair was somehow imbedded into his food, hence why he was so close to actually swallowing the damn thing. And secondly, none of us have black hair. When our waitress approached us my brother in law let her know about his unfortunate experience. She apologized and rushed off immediately to a group of men and women who had been sitting there almost our entire meeting going over paperwork. In hindsight, I believe the people at the table were restaurant investors or owners of some importance because when our waitress told one of the men about our situation they all looked over with a look of distress and the manager or (owner?) immediately went back into the kitchen. Eventually he approached my brother in law and profusely apologized for the disgusting hair. To be fair, both he and the waitress were very polite and professional.The reason I decided to give a one star rating is because after all the apologies and talk about holding themselves to a higher standard, the manager/owner didn't even comp my brother in laws meal! We were all completely appalled that we were expected to pay for a meal that had a health contamination.We were told that Asado holds itself to a higher standard and they were so sorry. Yet my brother in law found a hair in his food and then had to pay for the meal. We did not decide to argue with the guy, and paid for our meal and left, agreeing we wouldn't be returning."}, {"review_id": "IKCFtNcpFzHAB7C9E0r_Eg", "user_id": "qh5hZ-zlyEdQAgPgqihzCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/25/2017", "text": "Just WOW! This place beat every expectation I had for an Argentine steakhouse! Right off the bat, the ambience of the place lets you know you are in for a dining experience - the layout is very inviting, and the decor sets it apart. Our group ordered just about everything on the menu, and no one left disappointed. The service was fantastic; our drinks were consistently refreshed, without any unnecessary interruptions. I highly recommend the appetizers - if you try any, get the Empanadas - best I've ever had. For my entree, I sprung for the Costilla de la Carne, and I was not disappointed! Perfectly done, to my expectations, and so flavorful!The parking out front is limited, but there is plenty to be found on the side streets; if you've been holding off for a visit to Asado, go now!"}, {"review_id": "RTzsxsqgUaTAs-PTozfZmA", "user_id": "Xki-AgOlTBlK8XFw8tgLSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "I was looking for a place to celebrate my dads birthday. I actually reached out to this place via FB messenger to ask if i was able to BYOB as well as bring in a bday cake from a bakery. I got a response right away letting me know I could bring in my own cake (from a reputable shop) and I could also bring in my own wine for a small corkage fee. They then told me they could set up a reservation for me as well.  I ended up at the restaurant on a Friday night. The place was packed and parking was hard to find but they actually offer valet for just $5.As for the food, it was delicious. I, and most of my table, chose the lomo which was fantastic. Although this is a Brazilian steakhouse house it's more of a normal sit down style and food with a Brazilian flair. Overall the service (before the visit and during) was wonderful and so was the food."}, {"review_id": "JF3QMarW6RFfbvT_Ws7qrg", "user_id": "Em_K0dMDHCxMB6nK2MPTJQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Ate here on April 26th for dinner.

Lol. 30 some dollar steak entree served with a cup of polenta. The steak did have a nice crust, but mine came well done, when I had ordered medium. :/ flavor was nice with the chimichurri garnish around the plate.

The staff was attentive (opening the door) and friendly (sociable) from the moment we stepped into the restaurant until we left.  The food was amazing: chimichurri butter & bread while we wait for our appetizers (mixta sampler with empanadas, calamari, and chorizo crab cakes ), hubby had the sea bass (which was moist & delicious) and I ordered off their special menu...braised short ribs with blue cheese dressing, Japanese mushrooms, & asparagus (it was onolicious). We couldn't go wrong with red wine & sangria.   We usually don't have room for dessert but they offered us a freebie since it was our anniversary...we ordered the stuffed crepes w/pistachio ice cream (OMG! Was that da bomb!?!). I will try a recommended restaurant at least once. In return, I totally recommend this place and will be back soon...so I can try other tasty dishes.

I also ordered calamari and crab cakes of the HH menu. The calamari was edible and that's about it. They were cut thick and sat in a pile of oil and they were far from crispy. The crab cakes were good bc there was chorizo mixed in it and it had a nice crust. Our server started us with potato bread which was fluffy and dense that came with chimmichuri(sp) butter uhm delish!!!! I came during Tacoma restaurant week which is always a steal. I got the espalda which is a grilled flat iron steak and it came with poblano polenta and it was okay nothing to dance for. My eating partner got the petite mixta which was pretty tasty! It came with chorizo, shrimp, and flat iron steak.

It was an absolute pleasure dining in this fine 6th Avenue steakhouse- service, food, ambience all on point. I made the reservation through OpenTable for a Saturday late evening right when it was getting super busy and had no issues there. The inside is painted with a naturally earthy color scheme from light olive to a brownish burnt orange tint, and has a cattle ranch theme to it. The front end of the kitchen is open and visible so you can hear hustle and bustle of sizzles and clinking of kitchen work- lots of people, lots of commotion, lots of energy. For appetizers, the pork belly gnocchi and cheese is a good choice. The pork carries a rich flavor; it has a crispy outer, is tender on the inside, and has just enough fat to melt in your mouth. I ordered the 12 ounce cut Lomo (you know, protein), which is tenderloin, and for the side I chose the purple mashed potatoes. The steak is seasoned nicely and has got a peppery flavor to it. The onions and purple mashed potatoes make for an admirable sidekick to the steak- like Robin is to Batman. The service was highly attentive with everything. The server- he was a bearded lumberjack-looking guy and he was super friendly and personable about giving recommendations and letting us know his honest opinions on what's good. Asado earned my respect and appreciation, and also humbled my biased attitude about Tacoma's food scene a notch."}, {"review_id": "NdJxEpZlO-kxyYgIrrSfkA", "user_id": "9fpECUsOcsOPVy0WXMWgjg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Let me start this 2 star review by saying it has nothing to do with the service. Quite the contrary. The bartender was very helpful and friendly and the waitress was as well. Their service is what makes this review a. 2 Star because the food was not worthy of a star. The queso tastes of figs. That may be the desired effect but my table didn't dig it. 2/4 of us ordered burgers, which I get is taboo at an Argentinian steakhouse but we tried it and regretted it. The meat was tasteless and fell apart and the bun was subpar. I thought the steak skewer was good but the rest of my table said it was too chewy. Only 3 beers on tap but they had SpaceDust in the bottle.

Their mule was good as well, a little sweeter than I like, but had a good hit of ginger. Appetizers: Their chorizo crab cakes were super delicious  - a good balance of spicy chorizo and sweet crab. There was hardly any filler (like many subpar crab cakes have) but had a good crispy outside, so I'd definitely order those again. Their appetizer salads are good and large enough for two share. Entrees: Their steak was delicious, seared and crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Their mashed potatoes are great and perfectly seasoned. We also had the special which was the pork belly and scallops. The scallops were okay, and the pork was good. But the star of the show was the broccolini. I could eat an entire plate of those. They were grilled and had a nice char, but were tender and juicy. The seasoning on them was perfect and it was the most delicious vegetable I'd ever eaten at a restaurant. Seriously...it's a few days later and all I want to do is go back and eat a plate of those. Props to the chef that cooked that broccolini.Only negative thing to note was getting our food was a little slow, but it was crowded on a Monday night and our server was nice and very apologetic. He definitely made sure we were happy - so overall good service."}, {"review_id": "t9FuRtLDQKePbIvJT9vOUg", "user_id": "DLaMUK0WcR9fWYqlEYxvpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "We had a Saturday dinner at Asado at the end of January.
