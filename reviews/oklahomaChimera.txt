Chic / Hip and Neat.  The team behind the bar were knowledgable and friendly.   - Free wifi YES!!! - Easy to find- Plenty of seating - Most seats have power - Varied music (jazz / hip hop / acoustic mix) My focus was on coffee... had both the Ethiopian and GuatemalanThe Ethiopian: wash style (pour over) and it was smooth, with a touch of fruit. I normally take sugar and cream, but not with this cup.. nothing needed.... just a smooth cup of javaThe Guatemalan: wash style (pour over) and it also was very smooth. Just straight java, now frills and thrills... it was NOT bitter, so no need to add anything to the cup.  Drinking it black was just fine.  Nice decor ... easy to chill in this place..."}, {"review_id": "I3UWTx5q_230U2LrJQK6_A", "user_id": "7V9ngjaFLVFX37tLpYfJPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This place is an awesome spot for vegan food. They have many items to choose from for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Everything I've had, which is most of the vegan menu, has been awesome. Tons of vegan baked goods/pastries that are all yummy.

The people are super laid back and the food is absolutely delicious. This will be my second time visiting. Full disclosure... last time I was here was for Hanson day/May Fest. It was a mad house and the crowd was driving the staff up the wall. I'm so happy I made it back on a normal day and everything was beyond perfect. The coffee is superb, the staff all work together to serve you and again... can't say enough great things about the breakfast tacos. There are about 6 different types on the menu! Explore on! Enjoy!!

Sometimes other types of pastries, including fig rolls!

I came here for breakfast on Sunday and was really digging this place. You can see that it's a popular spot. We came in around 9:30 and it had a decent crowd and then more & more people trickled in as the morning progressed. It's a very chill spot. Cute atmosphere. It's got a bit of a hipster vibe, but it's still a good place to grab breakfast for all ages. Their breakfast menu was composed of breakfast tacos, bowls, and a couple of plated items. In the spirit of trying new things, I tried their Twinster's Vegan plate which was pretty delish. My friend went with good ole eggs, bacon and toast and was talking about how fresh it all was. I really enjoyed this spot."}, {"review_id": "QoCMdbfdVxRMYArYojEBsw", "user_id": "ns36GHWtveP2vGOQDR0MeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/24/2017", "text": "This review is long overdue, I've been coming to Chimera for years and it's one of my top 5 recommended places to try when people come in from out of town. It's also a good spot to grab dinner before a show at Cain's Ballroom, Brady Theater, or Guthrie Green because of its superb location. Chimera now even has it's own little venue area for shows/events in the back so check that out if you want to come to a show or need a place to host something. Traditionally, Chimera is my go to brunch spot in Tulsa. Great coffee selection and they are always doing cool new things and sourcing fantastic coffee most of which is local.I like the fast casual set up because it allows more freedom than a traditional table service set up. I like that if I need more water, I just walk over and get some. Service here has always been good. I've been here dozens of times and I've never had a bad experience. One of my favorite things about Chimera is the variety offered. You can get everything from a great cup of gourmet coffee to local draft beer to a decked out cocktail while also enjoying a perfectly crafted meal. A lot of places have great coffee and a lot of places have great food, but Chimera is the best of both worlds. As every other review mentions, the tacos here are killer. They serve breakfast tacos and dinner tacos (for times served I'd recommend checking their website because it could change). The Disappearer is my favorite breakfast taco. It's a classic with egg, bacon cheddar, chipotle crema, and cilantro. My favorite lunch/dinner item is a new discovery: the Bluebird sandwich. The Bluebird sandwich has grilled chicken, bacon, pickled blueberry smash, brie, mayo, and tons of flavor. Sandwiches are served with veggies chips or carrots and hummus. The menu is pretty versatile with awesome vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options.What I really love about Chimera though is the attention to detail. It's the little things that matter. Like how the silverware is wrapped with twine and tied with a tiny bow, the fruit cup is artfully arranged with a wide variety of fruits (not just cantaloupe-seriously, it's beautiful), and the art/decor just makes you feel like you've stepped into somewhere special. This is the only place I know that has truly gender neutral restrooms (way before that was even a thing)."}, {"review_id": "-CoTiUb9xGvAf349iLOGeA", "user_id": "m4IkQUw11p9hloT1H0nZ0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Stopped in for breakfast while driving across country.

They have an awesome coffee bar (and full bar) if you're into that sort of thing along with your meal, and they've recently started a dinner service which has some awesome burgers and apps as well.

I have wandered into Chimera a few times on Sunday when staying downtown (after a long and lively Saturday night). They have a diverse menu with lots of exotic diet options and a DJ, but thankfully on a Sunday the music was not too loud. The staff appear to enjoy themselves as much as the customers. That is always a good sign. There is a bar, but a bridge too far for me on a Sunday. I imagine this is a great spot for a late night coffee or drink with friends, too.

This humble cafe/ bar/coffee house in the heart of Tulsa, has a charrette of complimentary offerings. Their almond milk chai latte had the perfect amount of creaminess and spice- and the cinnamon dusted topping is perfect. The decor is eclectic with a rustic western charm. There is ample seating and the artwork displayed are all conversational pieces. The service was friendly, and I appreciated them delivering drinks to our table. The vibe is deep chill and cozy. Great place to collect ones thoughts and reflect. If I lived in Tulsa, I'd be a regular here.

If you're looking for a restaurant that has several vegetarian and vegan offerings, that taste good, then Chimera is for you. Vegan/Vegetarian options in Tulsa seem to be rather limited, however Chimera has done a great job in designing lots of menu options that cater to this culinary niche.Food: We ate here twice during the Williams Route 66 marathon.Ann:Day 1 and 2: Twinster's Vegan Plate - Loved it! Tofu scramble and cashew spread were particularly noteworthy!Me: Day 1: Aeropress 8 oz hot coffee, Auntie's Oatmeal, Toast - I like a dark-roast coffee, so I didn't enjoy the aggressively-brewed light-roast at all. Oatmeal was a bit dry but I added some steaming hot water and some salt, and that fixed it. Wheat toast, cashew and mango spreads were good.Day 2: Daydream Nation Bowl - Outstanding! I was a little skeptical about having black beans for breakfast, but this bowl was fantastic! The chipotle crema added a rich and smooth texture to the bowl.Atmosphere: Retro, art-decco, coffee-house vibeParking: Limited parallel street-front parkingPrice: For breakfast/brunch, for a party of two, expect to spend between $30-$45. Service: Courteous, friendly, and moderately quick.Seating: The restaurant itself has a small-medium footprint with limited floor seating. There is additional seating at the bar. Chimera seems to be a very popular eatery in downtown Tulsa and on both visits there was a line of at least 8-10 people in the morning - arriving early is highly recommended."}, {"review_id": "riqflFOwqX3Zd6bzC-0Raw", "user_id": "j0uS3_b-RtkZBjKQpMUfZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Really good food with delicious gluten free options!  Good atmosphere and excellent service.
