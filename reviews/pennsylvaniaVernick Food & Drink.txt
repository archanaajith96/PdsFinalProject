Our server was knowledgeable and prompt and definitely took the time when we asked questions. The only downside is this place is a bit loud!! I was with my family so we had quite a spread of the dishes, and I have to say everything was phenomenal.Highlights from our table:Crab toast - loaded with crab on a chewy piece of sourdoughStriped jack - freshhhh fish with avocado cream, a little tangy and drizzled with jalapeño oil. Surprisingly flavorful without being too much spiceSquid ink pasta - savory, creamy, with chunks of lobster Porkchop - super tender, juicy served with cipollini onions and potatoes I can't wait to celebrate here again!"}, {"review_id": "mzBZrIAibPIBe4Rqc0t_3w", "user_id": "z393W1wNCBtcM-fNYIv_mw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "VISIT HISTORY: - Last visit: Last Sunday with a girlfriend for a late night drink - Frequency: First time! - Next visit?

My first time at Vernick was nothing short of amazing and I recently returned in hopes of reliving the phenomenal experience I had first time around.Last year, we were seated at the chef's table, giving you a prime view into the kitchen, the chefs handiwork and letting your eyes feast on all the dishes that are being meticulously prepared. This year, we made reservations months in advance and were looking forward to our second visit. Upon arriving, we were seated in the upstairs dining area near the patio windows and had a lovely view of the city street. As for food, chef Greg Vernick likes to regularly switch up the menu every now and then, so I was disappointed when I found out that they axed the grilled octopus on the menu...which was amazing! We knew right away what dishes we wanted to reorder (Maryland Crab Toast, YAASSS!) and also decided on other new dishes to try:-Maryland Crab Toast (Recommend)-Amish Chicken-Squid Ink Capellini with Lobster-Grilled Black Sea BassThe food was not bad at all, the meats and seafood were cooked well. This time, the entrees did not stand out to me in any way. Possibly because I found that every dish we ordered was extremely SALTY (...I felt like I had licked a salt block by the end of my meal).Service was good and our waitress was knowledgeable about the food.Sadly, I don't think I will return since I was disappointed with the food on my second visit. However, I do feel Vernick is worth a shot if you haven't tried it already, especially at the chef's table."}, {"review_id": "zg6tSqqy-IKDyJac8ldhVQ", "user_id": "1bSo9vqRaZnl1mwsoZJP5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "When visiting my friend in Philadelphia, we planned for a big night on the town starting with a dinner at Russet. When we got a call from Vernick about spot opening up at the chef's table minutes before our afternoon train into Center City, though, we had no problem running back to the car to chuck our BYO bottle. We're going to Vernick, baby.When we arrived for our reservation at 6:30, we found ourselves waiting by the door for a good 10 minutes as there was some kind of seating snafu. I took some time to look at the bustling front space. The flat screen TV blaring sports somewhat mitigates the clean elegance of the bar.When we were finally seated, we found ourselves with a prime view of the kitchen. The guy working immediately in front of us was on mushroom toast duty, but we could see a lot of cool stuff happening, including tweezing herbs onto crudos.I wish we had been more hungry, as the menu is big and tempting, but our visit was a little too close to our Reading Terminal Market trip. We opted for smaller plates over entrees to try to sample more of the menu.Our meal started with a tasty little soup amuse. Our first dish ended up being the black trumpet mushroom and miso eggplant toast ($16), which was substantial and so, so good. Such a deep umami flavor from the mushrooms and roasted eggplant. Great charred bread. If you wanted to fill up here, I would recommend getting the toasts-- they all look tasty, the portion is big, and the price isn't bad.Next up was a special pasta ($20something?) with squid. There was both a slightly spicy tomato-based sauce and a refreshing, slightly salty foam. This was good, but not as special as its presentation.At the same time, we received the sea urchin with warm scrambled eggs ($17). This was presented in a sea of yogurt, which wasn't mentioned (my companion is lactose-intolerant). The uni was good quality and so soft and sweet, but I didn't think the dish worked. Something about the warm scrambled eggs and the plain tart yogurt... it was three contrasting flavors that failed to mix, and three soft textures that were unsettling together. Surprised that this appears to be a signature dish for them when the execution was so off. Just too rich to enjoy.Next, and probably my favorite dish, was the striped jack crudo ($17). The plating is classic nouvelle cuisine, but every component of it shined. You could taste the grilling in the grilled jalapeno oil, vegetal but not spicy, and the dots of avocado were as bright and fruity as they looked. The fish was lovely, and its soft texture worked well with the contrasts on the plate. We finished off with a panna cotta which was tasty but unexceptional.I'm going to give a special shoutout to the drink program here. Very tasty cocktail menu, with everything that I want to drink. I had 'Til The Money Runs Out ($14) and it goes on my shortlist for best drinks of 2018 thus far. Pineapple gin, chartreuse, egg white, lime, bubbles... fizzy and tropical and a little bit herbal. I could drink twenty of these, but I'm glad I didn't as it packed a punch despite the light taste.Wine list was also strong. On the recommendation of our waitress, I had a glass of German orange wine from Enderle and Moll ($16) that was complex but not bracing, exactly what I look for in natural wines.Service at the host stand was again complicated as we gave them our coat check tickets which then got lost... so we ended up waiting 15 minutes again in a busy space. And missing our Uber. Not great, though they recognized that they messed it up. Service at the table was good and on top of it. Pacing was decent and we ended up spending about 2.5 hours here, largely at our own option. Watching the kitchen is a special experience.Damages were not bad... about $115 for two of us pre-tax and -tip (so a small meal and a drink for each person). I think likely that this is one of the better spots in Philly but I didn't have enough to see the full talents of the kitchen. I'm dinging them on two rich seafood dishes that should've been home runs but failed to deliver. I would be happy to return and give them another shot."}, {"review_id": "-ddOCiLsyJXIntCTu0IVpg", "user_id": "GWOf1oB2mTalRY_A-EjSiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Vernick is by far the best meal I've had in Philly so far. Plus the service is lovely and the ambiance is great, a very classy yet minimalist feel. We didn't have a reservation but came early one night and didn't end up having to wait too long for a table near the bar.Seriously everything we had (with one small exception) was spectacular. Start with a toast or two to share (the mushroom and eggplant is a must, the avocado and radish is also up there). For the mains, the whole Amish chicken was more than enough for two people. It was beautifully presented, wonderfully savory, and took chicken to a whole new level. Make sure to order a side of cauliflower as well, the colors alone will dazzle you. The only forgettable dish was the side of potato which was surprisingly lukewarm and lackluster. But really only a small blip in what was an incredible meal."}, {"review_id": "i3s-WDOL_ra0POgrW1Wf_A", "user_id": "mkOygeSt9TXbe5ETD4YeAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Best meal of my life!!!! Here's why!This is the best food served in Philly. Staff spoke about their training, like tea seminars, so that they can be as saavy as possible. The staff was so friendly , and knew so much about each dish and wine. It's a small space, so make a reservation in advanced! Decor is smart, wood and modern lighting. We got a beautiful view from our table by the window.  I'm still so amazed by the flavors! This meal is now the hallmark meal that I will compare everything to. We started with a delicious complimentary amuse fennel soup. Even just a sip tasted so smooth and complex. Our next item is the infamous sea urchin. This sea urchin dish needs to be scooped with a soup spoon. You need to grab a little bit of everything in a bite. So some sea urchin, some scrambled egg, some green onion and a bit of the creamy yogurt foam. It was fabulous. It is incredible, salty and creamy with great texture. Then, we had the crab toast. Such sweet and savory flavors...on toast! Even the bread had amazing smoky flavor that worked so well with the crab.  The squid ink pasta is made fresh every single day. The sauce was amazing and the pasta was so soft and fresh. The perfect finish was the not too sweet not too sour lemon ice cream sandwich. This was topped with sorrel, a micro green that tastes like lemon! Such incredible and thoughtful food. Perfect and unique dining.I will be back with lots of friends! I just want everyone to try how amazing this good is."}, {"review_id": "qlzryXozsccMmsrxvgVLhQ", "user_id": "wojMqIU5hJAv71o9h2mCig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Another perfect meal at a favorite neighborhood treasure. My friend and I went in without a reservation and sat at the bar. He had a margarita and I had a bourbon old fashioned, which really hit the spot on this cold night. We were presented a delicious seasonal amuse bouche of sweet potato soup with ginger creme fraiche. To start we shared a small plate of the raw, diced artic char with crispy skin and dill. It was so fresh, flavorful, and light - served with homemade crisps. Rarely do I see seared foie gras on a menu and so when I saw it on the special menu I had to indulge. The perfectly seared decadence  served with braised leeks and a chutney sauce. It was heavenly. My friend had never had it before and loved it also. For our large plates, he ordered the seared tuna which was light and wonderful, and beautifully fanned across the plate. And following my instinct to order delicacies not regularly available, I couldn't resist the sweetbreads. They were tender and perfectly cooked. What an indulgence to have foie gras and sweetbreads in one meal. Oh how I love this spot and their unique exquisite and delicious creations."}, {"review_id": "v-Fw8fOaD4OWBUzadpJ-hQ", "user_id": "camsLrxzabub7uX6OUEP9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "About a month ago I decided to make random reservations for restaurants I'd always wanted to go to and Vernick was #1 on that list- and thankfully was not disappointed. The ambience is very cute especially upstairs when the windows are open and the weather is great. The tables are close together but not so much so that your conversation is drowned out. Our server was also fantastic; good knowledge of the menu and was always available without being overbearing or rushed. Our meal for two took about 2 hours which is long for me, as I've always been one to \"eat and get out\" but this stands as a compliment to the food and the pace of the service. The complimentary soup with a heavenly piece of bread was incredible so much so I would have ordered it was a main dish. The menu is lined up with multiple small plates to share. There is a hefty \"toast\" section which offers various toppings on sourdough bread. We went with the fromage blanc & kumquat which was a perfect blend of creamy and sweet with the toast being a fantastic vessel for the toppings. Our other plates included the broccoli In spicy peanut sauce as well as the blackened cauliflower. I'm not one for vegetables at times but the blacked cauliflower was the best vegetarian dish I've ever had- perfectly seasoned with a great cream sauce. Our mains consisted of sea bass which was reportedly fantastic as well as the lamb confit which was also great- superbly fatty with indulgent black truffle and creamy whipped potatoes. Dessert did not disappoint as well, as we shared the maple pecan bar which was very much like pecan pie with a dollop of ice cream and was the perfect end to a superb meal. Easily the best dining experience I've had in Philadelphia so far and a place I will definitely be coming back to!"}, {"review_id": "2UAdC0_J_Yy3lBtM5wE_1w", "user_id": "ANrHuIPMIJzTyJftS_Yb4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "The experience at this place was perfect from the minute I walked through the door to the hosts and server saying goodbye as I left.

Creative menu and attentive service, casual vibe. Just what I needed after a long day. Food was great but not without caveat tho. More on that later. I came in on Tuesday early evening. No reservation . Lucky me! I snacked a table by window right away - the benefit of dining solo :) I had studied the not-too-long menu prior so I went straight to what I wanted (and I was starving!): uni, soft-scrambled eggs and lamb confit with black truffle !!!Food came quickly. I started with the uni dish. It came in a soup bowl. It was not chowder nor is it chawanmushi. The golden uni \"floating\" on top of ocean wave of yogurt. What? Let me break it down for you - digging all the way in, spoon out the buttery scrambled egg with scallion, creamy yogurt and briny sea urchin, taking it all in one bite. Has your head exploded yet? It is certainly not an usual combo - yogurt and uni, and I think the yogurt is overpowering the delicate uni. But I adore the creativity and I do like scallion scrambled egg - just the way my mom used to make it :)Next up, the lamb confit. It was beautifully black-and-white:scumptious lamb belly, aromatic black truffle aka \"black diamond\" and glaze , decorated with creamy, whipped potatoes and green chimuchurri sauce. The lamb belly was super juicy tender inside yet crispy on the outside - one can single handedly cut it open with a fork. Perfect proportion of meat vs fat. Plus the shaved black truffle , umami xxL! Paired it with a fruit forward, high acidic Mencia. Perfection. My only pet peeve was though the chimuchurri could tone down a bit and so as the glaze (too sweet too thick to my liking), so that the subtle fragrance from black truffle can shine more. Service was prompt and attentive from beginning to finish. I shall certainly come back and try more on the menu next time in town. I have my eye on the seafood roast ;)"}, {"review_id": "CZc0NjG0fEpTbOAA1HwIDA", "user_id": "TkXMUw-JsVJa-qtX-EVHOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "4.5 stars.

I had just left a spirit tasting so, for once in my life, I did not order a beverage however rumor has it that this place throws together some good cocktails. I ordered something easy for a vegetarian, the lettuce thing. It was actually huge considering it was a small plate. It was delicious. The \"lettuce thing\" was actually grilled romaine, figs, and aged cheddar. I cannot comment specifically on the age of the cheddar or whether this has implications in regards to the flavor. My memory regarding the details is fuzzy but picture this: a giant lettuce boat adsorbed by a bunch of white stuff that was smooth and creamy. This was not only tasty but also masquerades as something relatively healthy. That avocado toast with spicy radish was an absolute must. This was DUMB good, like 25 IQ. There's a gigantic avocado smear on top of crispy bread, sprinkled with this orange substance that's supposedly spicy radish. Holy shit balls. My dining companion did not want any of this by some miracle and thank god bc I was able to put every last square centimeter (I'm trying to be \"international\" with my choice of units if you didn't notice) into my digestion areas.For dessert my dinner companion ordered cheesecake which had a lemon flavor and some sauce that was creamy, sitting on top of a crumbly graham crust pedestal.

The food was outstanding and was the reason I stuck with 4. It surprised me, but the cauliflower stood out. I've never had such good cauliflower! Cooked perfectly and the yogurt sauce was on point. Avocado toast, sea urchin, broccoli were all very good. I'd put the avocado toast at the top of that trio. Amish chicken was super tender. The pepper vinegar sauce wasn't spicy I'd say, but went really well with the chicken. Definitely preferred the lemon cookies to the chocolate cake for dessert. The only reason I seriously considered three stars was the service, and it wasn't the server. The server was polite and knowledgeable, but he simply wasn't around. Every time we sat around with empty water or drink glasses, dirty plates, or with the card waiting with the check, he was busy attending to other tables. I simply think his section was too large.

Man, were they right. From beginning to end, this place was an all around 5 stars. Walking in, doors were opened by the hostess, upon being seated, water glasses were filled, and menus were then explained. Food came out at such a reasonable time. I didn't feel rushed at all and never at a point where I felt like I was waiting forever for food or drinks.Spanish mackerel - I'm not a big fan of raw fish in general, so I didn't eat much of it. My wife surely inhaled it though. I really enjoyed the chips that came with it.Wagyu beef pastrami - This was by far my favorite. The beef just shredded apart and the flavor was right on point. I really wanted to order another one. Mmmm, *mouth drooling*Squid ink spaghetti - another good dish. I love cockles (little mini clams), so this dish was right up my alley. I thought it was a little on the saltier side, but it paired really well with my martini.Turbot fish - when the server told us that they only had limited supply of this fish available to order for the night, the wife and I had to jump on it. We were so glad we did. Our server was 100% correct on this dish. It was flaky and so buttery. I loved every bite. We ate this thing down to it's bare bone. My wife actually wanted to pick up the bones and suck off the remaining juices (but she didn't). Blueberry pie - I thought this was better than Maine's blueberry pies. Not too sweet. They didn't overload it with sugar, so you can really taste the natural sweetness of the blueberries. The ice cream that was served with it was quite interesting. It was some sort of flower flavored ice cream. I really enjoyed it.Overall - I can't wait to come back.

Vernick does a good job of a no-frills dining room that still manages to feel cozy yet elegant. Food:The food is by far the main attraction at Vernick. DIshes tend to be twists on American comfort food. One dish I particularly enjoyed was the sea urchin served on scrambled egg. Over several courses at Vernick I enjoyed flavor combinations I had never imagined. The dishes are sophisticated, offering multiple textures and flavors. The wait staff was very knowledgeable and advised about the best way to eat certain plates, such as getting all three textural layers of the scrambled eggs. I would recommend ordering multiple courses, definitely including one of the toast offerings, to share with friends. Come prepared to try new things and not love everything you have - as the flavors are bold and not for everyone. Wouldn't recommend for picky eaters. The food lived up to the hype!Drink:Much like the food, the cocktails offer a few twists on the classic as well as, to my knowledge, all new creations. I didn't love the cocktails, but they were very well made. Don't let my own review discourage you, as your experience at Vernick will very much be impacted by your own tastes. Service:Service was excellent at the bar. The bartender was friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. She was happy to take back a cocktail I did not like and replace it with another free of charge - even after I offered to pay for it! The waiters were professional and explained the dishes well.

My fiancé and I  came here for my birthday celebration dinner. We were promptly greeted and seated. We got a delightful window table on the second floor. The server quickly greeted us and took our drink orders. The cocktails were great. The beer options were pretty good as well. For appetizers, we got the Maryland crab toast, pastrami and squid ink pasta. All were amazing, but the crab toast was out of this world. The seasoning was superior to typical crab seasoning. And the crab was so fresh chunky.  That said, it was a small portion for $17.00.  But I guess it is crab. For our meals, I got the beef rib and my fiancé got the fish. The fish entree had an Asian spin and was served in a green broth. My fiancé liked it but wasn't blown away.  I typically don't like beef rib but wanted to see if the chef would do it in a way that elevated the meat. While a valiant effort, it wasnt enough to make the rib actually enjoyable. I am shocked that the chef even chose to use beef rib. In my opinion, it is just not a good cut of meat. It is too tough with little flavor.  For dessert we got the Jewish apple cake, which was probably the second best thing we ordered. When ordering the waitress suggested that we order something that is not always on the menu because certain items which are always on the menu can be ordered any time. However, I dont agree with that because the reality is that I dont dine at places like this often and might not be there again for years.
