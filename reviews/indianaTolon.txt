There were four of us, and split the Brussels sprouts for an appetizer. They were unlike any other Brussel sprouts any of us had ever had. They were crispy and tossed with a fish vinegarette and Indiana maple syrup. Incredible. The main course I had the scallops. They were large and cooked to a sweet perfection. The wait staff was very professional and very knowledgeable about the menu. Will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "CpsmLOhf9J57zFyRGdp8aQ", "user_id": "a4seSZMF9QxPBGAJ9MjaPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/31/2017", "text": "Family took us here for dinner when we were visiting from Chicago and I was impressed!The vibe in the place was rustic meets bar.Food was great!  Lots to choose from."}, {"review_id": "n_xNk6KjCkVaBcwZfBlaEw", "user_id": "K9MTfTPLDg6-LGMNq68fIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "GREAT farm to table restaurant staffed by friendly people and driven by an inventive kitchen!With the amount of work I do in the area around Fort Wayne, I have now eaten at several highly rated venues around town. I have no idea, however, why I've waited so long to eat at Tolon?!---bbq pork belly | \"bourbonyaki\" glaze | watermelon | gochujang vinaigrette | herb salad---I started with the BBQ Pork Belly almost curious how this combination of flavors would play out. I was not disappointed. THIS is a great dish! I'm a huge fan of gochujang and I loved the heat and the sweet crunch of watermelon.---steak frites |new york strip steak | duck fat frites | bone marrow demi | tolon butter---After the flavor-splosion of the BBQ Pork Belly, this dish wasn't as powerful as my palate needed it to be, but it was still delicious. I was prepared for the bone marrow sauce to bring the saltiness demi glace typically provides, however, it was surprisingly light. Thankfully Tolon provides a smart little salt cup with wooden ladle which I used liberally on the steak. The duck fat fries were a solid addition. I asked for the aioli everyone raves about only to find it a rather strange pairing.---blueberry sorbet---I would much rather drink my dessert than purchase anything sweet to conclude a typical meal, so I reluctantly glanced at the dessert menu my waiter dropped off. I'm always a fan of sorbet and I found myself ordering the flavor of the evening (see picture). It was the perfect ending to an exciting meal.I will most definitely be returning to Tolon in the future to try some of the other imaginative combinations Chef Nolot & Trabel dream up. I highly recommend you do as well!"}, {"review_id": "6_RZbFLFEw3ifsPlzWrYYw", "user_id": "8B0dPMRDf0BNFjBAvSd_fg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Went here just for drinks with my wife, parents, and brother and his wife.

The sweet potato \"grits\" was a unique twist.  Finally, for dessert I had the oatmeal cream pie which was good and my wife being gluten free had the blueberry sorbet which she said was the best she has had.  The atmosphere there was tremendous, really appreciate the fun vibe and energy.  The Midwest craft brew selection was perfect and our waiter, wish I could remember his name was great, but that's what happens when you wait.  I would definitely return."}, {"review_id": "ZJVg1NDEgmhRWpw3-6yDtQ", "user_id": "bNnBwW5kNO77KTgMeVhxKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2017", "text": "Tolon is a \"farm to fork\" restaurant (the first in Fort Wayne!) offering modern twists on Midwestern cuisine. They have a seasonal menu featuring solely local ingredients and are located right in the center of downtown. The interior is so warm and cozy and was the ideal place to spend a rainy afternoon.I will admit the lunch menu looked more appetizing than dinner, so I was excited that our timing worked out to try it. Husband ordered the pork rinds with cheese powder for an appetizer (I stayed away, lol). I ordered THE BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH EVER with honey, blue cheese aioli, and bread and butter pickles and it was SO GOOD! BUT THEN...Husband ordered a pot pie that made me want to send back my sandwich. It was full of veggies and herbs and everything else good under a pastry crust. SO INCREDIBLE! We topped off our lunch with some homemade (on the premises!) ice-cream. I think our flavor was brown butter pecan or something wonderful like that. It was thick and delicious and everything that ice-cream should be.Needless to say, I hope to be back to Tolon very soon in the near future! I'm interested to try the dinner menu, although it will be hard to pull me away from all the lunch goodness. And I know the menu will change again soon, so I'll look forward to checking out next season's offerings. I'm thrilled that Fort Wayne has a \"foodie\" restaurant, which also happens to be one of the best eateries in the whole city. Rock on, Tolon!"}, {"review_id": "qdv6M3sX2WeENtzzEhjlEw", "user_id": "wNUck-2aP1r6_mhvUBO30Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Delicious! Amazing! Great and quick service!!

They were very accomodating, and found us a table. The waitress for our section was occupied with two large parties, but other staff helped take care of us, and we never felt neglected. We ordered the pork chop and ribeye. Both were outstanding, and comparable to restaurants we've eaten at in Chicago. The cocktails were good, and the bananas foster cake dessert wit bourban ice cream was exceptional. My 4 star rating instead of 5 relates to atmosphere. It was VERY warm in the restaurant, so much so that the hostess opened the front door several times to cool off. It is also a bit loud.with that said, we will definitely be back and love the farm to fork cocept.

I don't have a single bad thing to say. Service was great from when we walked in the door to when we left (lost track of time & ended up staying past close, sorry!). My friend and I each started with an old fashioned but opted to have it made with makers mark rather than the rye that they normally would make it. SO yummy. We got the grilled shrimp for a starter. 6 huge pieces of shrimp with white bean & I believe am heirloom tomato mixture. Perfect for 2 people to split, definitely 3 if you are getting a salad or something else also. We then each got the watermelon salad. Note: it's huge! We probably could've split it but then we wouldn't of had wonderful leftovers to eat the next day. Watermelon, cucumber, mint, red jalapeños, perfection. We decided to split the chicken entree. It was so juicy that I could cut it with a fork. The white bean hummus was a nice side with it and the charred lemon was a great touch.I will definitely be back here. Hope to go once more before there summer menu changes to fall so I can experience some other things that looked awesome.

I have heard mixed reviews about the restaurant since it has opened but I had to try it out for myself. I made reservations for a Friday evening and the restaurant was pleasantly busy.  The adorable space is nestled downtown beneath Randall Lofts right off Harrison. You can find parking along the street or in a few of the lots close by. The atmosphere is bright and modern. There are cozy booths, wooden tables, exposed brick and local art hanging on the walls. There was a nice mix of music playing in the background, by no means loud, but made for a comfortable experience. The hostess welcomed us with a warm greeting and seated us right away. I must say I was blown away by our waitress! She knew every detail about the menu, was super friendly and made for an all around great dining experience. When she knew it was our first time to the restaurant she explained the farm to table concept and raved about all of the local vendors used to source items on the menu. I loved hearing about this. Each person who was working that evening seemed genuinely happy and were willing to accommodate us in any way. I started off with an old fashioned which did not disappoint. We decided to go with the Indiana brie cheese fondue for our appetizer. Oh my goodness, this was amazing. The cheese was warm with a nice little kick from the red chilies. And the focaccia bread made it the perfect pair! After our appetizer we split the brussel sprout salad, which was a heaping portion. It was fresh, crunchy and something different (in a good way of course). Then for our entrees we ordered the shrimp & grits and the chicken & waffles. Both of these were to die for. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and laid on a bed of whipped cauliflower with a perfect sauce on top. And the chicken and waffles was a unique, sweet and savory dish. The chicken was laid on two cornbread waffles with a perfect gravy to top it off. After checking out the dessert menu we could not resist trying to the house made ice creams. We tried a scoop of the Vietnamese coffee and a scoop of the bourbon buttermilk. These two were the perfect combo together. A fantastic treat to end our meal! If you have not made it in to Tolon, put this at the top of your list! The service, quality of food and atmosphere will not disappoint. I will definitely be coming back!"}, {"review_id": "sU1J2dwBRDM5gP44IQ0bHg", "user_id": "p9J7sBRAgrDDwT3XwpeUrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "This was probably my best experience in Fort Wayne.. it's a very busy restaurant that locally sources stuffs.... food was amazing and more than that the service offered by Michele was excellent .. she was so knowledgeable About the menu and went to great detail in explaining about  the dishes .

The place was pretty full for a Wednesday night in Fort Wayne, so that was a good sign. We had reservations, so we were greeted warmly and seated promptly. 30,000 foot view: after one visit, this is one of my favorite places to eat in Fort Wayne. Though it's a little on the expensive side, it's not overly \"fancy\". There is nothing pretentious about this place. Even the food portions are generous. About the meal:Drink orders went in (I ordered a beer, and my wife asked for a Stone Fruit Mule, which was made with vodka from our favorite distiller in Columbus, OH - MiddleWest Spirits). Both were excellent, and the Oyo vodka was a nice touch. This particular week, Tolon had a pre fixed menus in addition to their \"regular\" menu. Regular in that it actually changes several times a year or seasonally. We started with the Duck Fat Frites, which came with an aioli dipping sauce - awesome. My wife had the salad made with brussel sprouts, which she reported as tasty. I had the kale salad, which was definitely shareable btw. It was excellent. For the main course, my wife sampled the fried chicken and waffles - the chicken was plentiful and juicy - perfectly prepared. The cornbread pecan waffles with chicken sausage gravy were very good and made fresh. I was luck enough to get a few tastes - the dish was delicious. I had the ribeye, medium. It was cooked perfectly, and came with a sort of bleu cheese sauce that added a nice compliment to ribeye'a flavor. It was $44, but certainly one of the better ribeye I've had in Fort Wayne. Besides the food, the ambiance was very nice, and Connor took very good care of us. We will return to try something different soon!We eat out a lot - and I'm not known for giving 5 star reviews. But from our visit, I can't find fault. Food: excellent. Drinks: excellent. Service: excellent. Ambiance: excellent. Price: fair for the cuisine. Until they prove me wrong, this place gets 5 stars from me, although I'll keep lobbying Yelp to add 1/2 star increments after the 3-star tier!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tolon-fort-wayne?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
