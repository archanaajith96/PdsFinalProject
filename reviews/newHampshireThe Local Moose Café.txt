That's basically exactly what you get here. Honestly, I feel like many of the NH, VT, and ME I find myself in are rather similar. There's good coffee, service with a smile, a menu that would satisfy locavores as well as vegans, some couches, maple something or other, and some sort of twist. Here at TLM, that means a Vietnamese twist (sandwiches, coffee, doughnuts).  The banh mi is non-traditional but also not bad. Grilled, locally sourced pork is marinated in a Vietnamese sauce with ginger & garlic and topped with pickled root vegetables, cilantro, and cucumbers on a French baguette with sriracha mayonnaise and honey ginger mayonnaise. The pork was nice and I liked the mayo. Pickled vegetables didn't taste pickled and was missing that twang/sourness/sweetness. They do not add chilies either and that is a bummer as I like banh me to have some heat. The sriracha didn't come out unfortunately. Maybe have a bottle available? Also, the bread they used was a regular French baguette rather than a traditional rice flour baguette. Rice flour keeps it light on inside and crispy on outside. Theirs were still a bit light and chewy and I love that they make their own bread but I think I'd prefer the traditional one. Also, there was not much filling compared to bread. Additionally, their breakfast sandwiches are pretty solid. The basic \"free ranger\" is homemade brioche with Vermont cheddar and an egg. You can't have a good sandwich without good bread and damn that brioche was nice! TLM makes yeast doughnuts instead of cake doughnuts. I tried a maple bacon doughnut and thought it was just ok - certainly not as good as their bread. I don't really know how to describe it but it's like I grabbed a very good store-bought doughnut and slapped on my own maple syrup glaze and bacon pieces on. Also, I was hoping for more of that awesome maple syrup flavor. The space was cool, clean, and comfy. They even had an extra wide countertop which was nice. There was plenty of room for my food, laptop and backpack without spilling into someone else's personal space. Also, I only found two outlets - both near the Queen City Avenue entrance. Staff was pretty chill. No complaints. TLM is a cool place to read a book, sip coffee, grab a bite, and relax. However, if I need to be a laptop camper and get some work done for quite a few hours, that would be difficult on a busy day with just two outlets available. Still, I'll undoubtedly return."}, {"review_id": "yfwsP2-Gg2-N3RfAT2Z55Q", "user_id": "NDkwKnvjhBbjCh1cNlBoAw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "The Local Moose is a cute place to have breakfast in Manchester.  I had the Free Ranger (egg and cheddar) over greens instead of a brioche bun.  I added an extra egg and bacon, because otherwise, it's a tiny meal.  The eggs were a tad overcooked for me (I like a slightly runny yolk in my fried eggs).  If I order the Free Ranger again, I'll double the bacon.  I also had an herbal chai which I asked them to make into a latte, which was OK.  It lacked flavor; with their own chai they add a homemade vanilla syrup, which I'm sure adds depth of flavor."}, {"review_id": "ZLftKflg8JISCsaOBdyB7w", "user_id": "RC7tgbXfGZ_8awnWgVoZIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Everyone here is extremely nice, smiling and helpful.

We went with a lemon ginger donut, and each got a Banh Mi sandwich with a Vietnamese ice coffee.Although not purely traditional the sandwich had great flavors and tasted extremely fresh. The Vietnamese coffee was delicious and expertly made. And finally the donut was perfectly moist, with melt in your mouth texture unlike any donut from a normal shop. I didn't love the ginger topping, but that was the only downside- and more of a subjective personal preference.

I'm a very happy customer.We were heading north for a camping trip and decided to check out The Local Moose Café since it was only a small detour from the highway. Boy, were we happy we did! Alongside two cold-brew coffees, boyfriend got a Cubano sandwich and I had the Kale Free Ranger (kale microgreens, egg, and Cabot cheddar on an English muffin). Side note: Dear God, I love Cabot cheddar. We also had a doughnut each: one maple with rainbow sprinkles and one Elvis (peanut butter & banana with bacon). The cashier gave us two for the price of one, since they were closing soon--bonus!Everything was delicious, fresh, and clearly made with care. Our total was around $30, fairly pricey but worth it (IMO) for the quality of the ingredients and supporting a small business. We stopped in around 3 p.m. on a Saturday and were the only customers there at the time, but I can imagine it's busier in the mornings. There's plenty of seating and free WiFi, too.The only drawback is there's not much around/the neighborhood isn't walkable. However, if you're on the road like we were or just in the Manchester area and want to support an awesome small business, please give this place a go."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-local-moose-caf%C3%A9-manchester?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
