It is set in an old house just off the beach.For dinner my wife had the crab cakes with rice pilaf; I had the flounder on a bed of mushroom risotto, topped with crab meat and asparagus. Both of our meals were superb. In fact, we decided that we'd split them between us.Our waiter was attentive and helpful in explaining the menu items. There was a choice of a half-dozen locally-brewed craft beers on tap with more in bottles. The cocktails include a number of Tautog specialties.If you're in Virginia Beach and looking for seafood, give Tautog's Restaurant a try - you won't be disappointed.  Besides great food, they have free parking in the back - it doesn't any better than that!"}, {"review_id": "GePsTjuMhH0GBxi9t-US2A", "user_id": "KQxqFHzmFIHuRh5v4dbjGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "It's worth the hype!

This met the needs. We were seated in the covered porch. The fans were on, so it was pleasant in the mid September heat.We ordered the She Crab soup, stuffed flounder, and snapper (daily special). The soup is a solid, definitely needed oyster crackers for some salt. The entrees came out relatively quickly and were fresh. Both were plated well. Taste wise, the snapper was delicious, the bacon pieces added good flavor. The flounder was good, needing some salt, but added with the crab, it worked well.It is a solid option and we thoroughly enjoyed the rustic feel of the cottage.

They open around 5pm. It's best to be there at opening if you don't have reservations. Expect to wait a bit. We ate dinner there a couple of nights. The She Crab soup is good. Not the best I've had but close. The Ginger teriyaki salmon on cucumber/seaweed salad was delicious. The Special was 2 soft shell crabs with strawberry sauce  and basil risotto was just okay, and I would not order it again. I love seafood but these crabs were in sort of a cornbread crust and I they were just okay. The basil risotto was delicious. Too bad they don't sell it separately on their regular menu.  The crab dip was tasty, again, not the best but up there. The specialty drinks were good. They have a nice bar. The dress is casual and you will see all manner of dress.  This place is good for small children. There were a surprising number of families with all generations from the very young to the very old."}, {"review_id": "L3VWLRH8JULNQSmcas2e7A", "user_id": "UPFHkjRWmTETVlckZI-kyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "We come here for all of our family's special events - family in town, birthdays, anniversary's...you name it!It is hands down the best seafood restaurant in Virginia Beach.

It didn't disappoint this time, either.I loved the multitude of delicious looking gluten-free options on the menu, and I felt like the food I was eating was actually healthy without compromising any taste whatsoever. I got catfish with a cornmeal crusting and the most delicious roasted potatoes on the side! Last time we visited, we got the crab nachos and I highly recommend them!The atmosphere has a casual, close feel with lots of people packed into the dining areas- but not in a bad way at all! The service was friendly and quick, but not too quick that it felt like they were pushing us out in any ways.My husband ordered a beer from the draft list which included several local VA beers, which was nice to be able to taste something unique and local.Overall, plain and simple, this is quality, delicious food at the beach in a nice atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "5vbity2xJ0m-PwGVWZXSKg", "user_id": "CCWs_DDoCm-7tWiLhMz0Qw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "Tautog's is a place we never miss when visiting Virginia Beach. My boyfriend and I went there this past Saturday after I couldn't stop hyping it up for him. It was his first time, my fourth or fifth. A few things. First, the wait staff is amazing. They're all relatively young but are super nice and hardworking. We had Bodie and he was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. We got drinks to start (their Orange Crushes are my second favorite next to Watermans) and then ordered a dozen of the Benny's oysters. They're roasted with cheese and pesto and wow they were amazing. I got the Blackened Tuna (Bodie's recommendation) and holy shit it was one of the better seafood dishes I've had in a long time. It was PERFECTLY cooked med-rare (my choice) and was blackened and spicy/cripsy on the outside and just past rare on the inside as a Tuna should be. It was served with gorgonzola cheese and red onions and I couldn't stop gushing. It was also a huge piece of fish. My boyfriend got the Mahi and it was also excellent and big. The sauce they put on it is fantastic. For two drinks for the both of us, a dozen oysters app, and two main dishes our bill was about $80-$90, which was less than what I was expecting. We loved everything so much that we bought 5 T-Shirts on our way out. The atmosphere is so casual and it is definitely worth the wait if there is one. You've made a forever customer out of me :)"}, {"review_id": "vio9HtytStNAlnkOseB3gA", "user_id": "0IidrsGVqIVUwp3Ow2lAZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Amazing.

Their she crab soup had amazing flavor.  It also had large pieces of crab inside. The crab martini had a wonderful flavor with a big bite to it. I'm thinking it was jalepeno.  I ordered the scallops barca which was wonderful. The scallops were atop a puff pastry boat covered with a lemon beurre blanc. So yummy! My husband ordered the sage cornmeal coated catfish which looked very tasty as well.  My father in law ordered one of the special of the night, which was a snapper with cold calamari in a tarragon sauce. That looked wonderful and tasted just the same!My son was being a butthead that night, so we ordered a four cheese flatbread for him and ended us just bringing it home.  It basically was a personal pan thin crusted pizza. All I can say is that I cannot wait to come back!!
