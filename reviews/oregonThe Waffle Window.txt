I can never even make it to the amazing looking dessert waffles because I can never past the triple B! (Brie, Bacon and Basil with homemade jam - that's my jam!). Make sure to ask for the rewards card and get a free waffle after you've bought ten (trust me, you'll want to return 9 times.

It is a literal window that you order at. There is also a doorbell you have to ring if there is no one there to take your order. I don't think we pushed the button hard enough the first time so we waited in the cold for almost 5 minutes before ringing it again. That's when someone came. We ordered:- half chicken and waffle- rise and shineThe chicken was rather juicy which was a surprise to me because it is a hit or miss on how the chicken is prepared. The waffles were both sweet which threw me off because I was expecting a more savory flavor with ours. I was not impressed with the rise and shine. It looked good but I did not like the cheese on it. I was expecting to have a separate layer of cheese and not crispy around the edges. The sweetness again threw me off when I was eating it. You get the option of getting syrup or gravy on the side. My boyfriend and I both chose the gravy. It was thick and consistent. There is outside seating with benches under a tent or you can go sit inside which was another cafe."}, {"review_id": "hc-S7m7Nhxj8JBzTGcglcQ", "user_id": "eCMEytD_6sNUHA2lrzoZ4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "We were in the Hawthorne area, just came out of the Portland Cider House, and walked over to the Waffle Window since the guys were starting to get hungry.Ordered two waffles to share since we had already had a mountain of tots and some mac n cheese at the theater/pub down the street too.Super yummy. Forgot what all the names were, but I think they got the three B's, and we got the veggie one. It was a good enough size to split between two people, if you're hungry, it probably won't fill you up.

It's such a fun idea! I've eaten at the other locations before but this was my first at the Hawthorne spot! The four of us stopped here to grab some \"real\" food before we head off to cupcakes!We got ham&cheese, \"fuelbot 2000\" and \"cheddar, bacon & jalapeño\" and I opted for just a side of bacon as I ate at home. (Oops!)The ham and cheese gets 3 stars- the cheese was odd and not fully melted. It was a weird flavor. Fuelbot gets 4 stars- great bacon, perfect eggs, crispy waffle. Knocked down a star because the added sugar didn't really mix Jalapeño gets 5 stars- a good amount of spice paired really well with the sweet waffle and the cheddar  was good. The egg \"wasn't sunny side up\" but a good fried egg!Pepper Bacon- 5 stars!!! Everyone loved it. Right amount of crispy and the pepper adds a great flavor. Can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "UnKn6GEzAvOsYAyuPVGjmg", "user_id": "lQttOvOc30AV5r2QyNRvKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "All I wanted for my birthday was waffles, so my bestie took me here.

Pretty much the only thing that comes to mind are waffles. Who doesn't love a sweet or savory combination of delicious syrup on top of a golden brown crispy waffle? #SorryNotSorry pancakes. Just not a fan. I need some texture in my life. On the Yelp menu it didn't feature their Chicken & Waffles option. UM YES! Please keep this a secret. More for me..I mean Us. Sharing is caring. The chicken was very tasty, farm fresh. Better than what I've had before. Their gravy was pretty good in combo of the maple syrup. I was definitely feeling pretty satisfied after the half order.

The three B's is my favorite. I've tried a lot of the other flavors but I almost always order at least one three B's as an extra. The chicken and waffles is stellar (get the gravy for the sauce) but I have to be very hungry or have someone to share it with to finish it. I'm not sure if people generally eat their waffles alone but my sister and nieces always come with me and we share bites of our sweet or savory selections. The chocolate dipped waffle is simple but also scrumptious and even their plain waffle is a fun to go hand held treat. I also recommend their lemonade when it's available, they usually have some creative flavors. Also don't forget to start a punch card. You'll be back, I promise.

Whether you are craving something or savory, this place has options. Also, why not up your instagram game or your Snapchat? Great presentation every time. Other things to note for waffle window:1). They have a stamp card-buy 10 waffles, get one free. 2). You can't call in and order, so be prepared to wait a bit. 3). They have two different size waffles now, so pay attention how many of the liege waffles you want :)4). Check Groupon! Sometimes they have deals such as the one I used multiple times before moving: buy two waffles and two drinks for $16. It's. Basically a free waffle. My personal recommendations (and if you know my yelp reviews, they will be more sweet than savory, sorry!): Blueberry Cheesecake, Nutella and fresh banana, and strawberry and Nutella."}, {"review_id": "ylpZVfjBRVyjdiOzlCeH8A", "user_id": "1ninjaDuykoIZGyckpHMUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "SOOOOO GOOD.

However the recent price hikes don't give it the value preposition it previously had.When I visit the WW, I usually spring for the savories, particularly the three B's: bacon, Brie, and basil. Recently they added the option of getting a fried egg on it all and I've found that option to be very tasty as well. The waffles are very sweet, and it mixes very well with the savory of the bacon and the Brie. The savory is then balanced out with the peach jam.The combination of the sweets, savories, and acids is why I tend to prefer the savory waffles over the dessert waffles (desserts tend to be overwhelmingly sweet and rich). Whenever I have guests, I will make an effort to visit waffle window to showcase the eclectic Portland cuisine. I understand that the economy is forcing everything to be more expensive, but it still makes me think twice about spending something like 9 bucks on something that used to cost 5-6 bucks. A place like this is easily 4 stars but I regrettably have to give it a 3 rating due to price."}, {"review_id": "sm8BmY2fjEUKtIInZGHy0g", "user_id": "g34D6n4yRCxOf_F9g2kWpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "Tasty treat!A little small for my appetite but not so small that I would take away a star from my review.

Friend came here for his birthday freebie. I ordered the chicken waffle, full size $14.95. Comes with two fried chicken, two waffles and a choice of maple syrup or gravy. I've been here many times and have only ordered the sweet waffles. Never tried the savory waffles until today. I was a little bit disappointment in my decision today. I didn't really like my chicken and waffles. Nothing to rave about, probably because there was nothing special about. Service was nice and friendly as always. I would suggest sticking to the sweet waffles, preferably the ones with a scoop of ice cream. Omit the whipped cream if you can:) Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "PSwssyAB9G3jqfM-IMEKjw", "user_id": "17osXk_jqXFaLjnc0r7diQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "I wish you could order waffles without sugar chunks in them, but the savory toppings are amazing."}, {"review_id": "SHOXMnsS2XYsoeXlcjJutw", "user_id": "t1vBU-pcleo3SPfjT_iKlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2017", "text": "After spending a couple days in Portland, I came to appreciate the creatively of the food scene. It seems like almost every food concept is represented plus some. So waffle window. It's like an open face sandwich but with the sweetness of a waffle. Definitely a concept I will recreate when I go back home. I love making waffles and like the idea of doctoring them up.We ordered the spicy bacon cheddar jalapeño and farm fusion. The farm fusion was way better. It was a better value as it came with a good amount of vegetables. The ingredients were fresh. I liked the seating area outside with the picnic tables. A good dining experience, not amazing or mind blowing."}, {"review_id": "vN-g1ykUqZN8ZNt9jum0VA", "user_id": "i6817hoBPuTf6sAsupwt4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This was a real treat and nothing I'd experienced before!

Waffles literally served out of a window. There's no actual store front and can easily be missed except when there's a line out front. Across the street is a turquoise brick wall. Outdoor seating available. We came right after lunch so a sweet waffle was more fitting than a savory one. We ordered the Luck of the Irish from the March monthly specials. Fresh strawberries, chocolate mousse with a bed of whipped cream on a liege waffle. Ingredients were locally grown/made. Waffle was crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Not many places offer liege waffles and excel in making them. I could of done without all the cream and mountain of chocolate. Overall waffle was good to try but not memorable and with our long itinerary of good eats in Portland, I think I would opt for a different eatery. 3.5 stars."}, {"review_id": "lp2b4rtqZwR2zjGgRCvPwA", "user_id": "-6Mvirp6cAHgviRZhdmfjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2017", "text": "Waffle Window! Why can't we have one in the Bay Area?! One small window provides every type of waffle I could ever ask for. Visiting Portland, I wanted to come to the Waffle Window. We went on an early Saturday morning and Ellen T. (as always) had parking karma and found a spot outside of Blue Star Donuts. We walked over to the Waffle Window and there were about 6 people ahead of us. That gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu and make our choices. We decided to go savory and sweet. We ordered the Whole Farm Waffle (Thick cut pepper bacon, balsamic-red wine braised mushrooms and onions, roasted red pepper, spinach, tomato, and fresh sliced chevre marinated in lemon zest-thyme infused extra virgin olive oil) and a Pearl Sugar Waffle (yeast dough instead of a batter and are baked with pearl sugar). After ordering at the window, we waited a few minutes and then took our orders to a nearby picnic table where people could eat their waffles and enjoy the brisk air. We cut our orders in half and ate The Whole Farm first. The combination of ingredients were fresh and amazing together. If we weren't on an eating spree in Portland, I could've had another. The Pearl Sugar Waffle was also extremely memorable. It had a crunch to it different from other waffles. We were told this was due to using Pearl Sugar instead of granulated sugar.
