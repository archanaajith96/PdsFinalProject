Food selection was limited but it was adequate. Service was prompt. Decor was dated, simple and basic but the place was clean.

Beware of coming here if you have a sensitive stomach. Their food is quite rich. One half of an omelet and hash browns filled me up for the whole day. I would also avoid this place like the plague on Sundays after church-- the wait can be pretty long and it turns into an AARP convention at Chuck-E-Cheese. They also don't serve booze which also grants me the reality that I'm not in Portland anymore and this is the norm of most breakfast places in Rockford. This restaurant is famous for  their Swedish pancakes with lingonberries.-- and they are FANTASTIC. Make sure you eat them with everything... butter included. All-in-all a nice breakfast place to bring the family......just make sure to wear your fat pants."}, {"review_id": "e1j5mY-Vghfh6Cylk9eEmg", "user_id": "FfWWv6fSjh-m9-dkESMsYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "One of the best places for Swedish pancakes in town!

Also in this area, The Inn has probably the strongest and most accurate reviews compared to surrounding restaurants. I just love Swedish pancakes with the lingonberry sauce. They are so delicious here and I believe they use a salty butter, enhancing that sweet/salty experience most restaurants like to play off of. My only disappointment was that the lingonberry sauce is ordered separate from the pancakes. Except for the pancakes, I did not explore other authentic dishes. On the side I had sausage gravy and biscuits, two sausage links, and two over-easy fried eggs. All done perfectly. I especially loved the biscuits and used the extra sausage gravy as a dipping sauce for the sausage links. I definitely ate too much!I can't wait to try their breakfast buffet and the evening smorgasbord! Too bad it's about a 45 minute drive from Woodstock. Stockholm Inn needs to open up another location that's closer! Just how good is the food? When you see a bunch of seniors packing most of the tables on a Tuesday morning, you know it has to be good! All ages show up here, right down to a younger man clad in a leather motorcycle vest, showing off full-sleeve tattoos on both arms. If you are in the area, go nowhere else for a fantastic home-cooked meal."}, {"review_id": "lRU5TeH6GvsSSWc5DiucYQ", "user_id": "ApjSaDZD9OeSqimHE9Qo0Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "I was hoping for more because of the Yelp ratings and being voted the best breakfast in Rockford.  The scrambled eggs tasted like powered mass produced eggs.  The pancakes were heavy and tough versus light and fluffy.  The sausage was slightly burnt.  The service was good and quick.  The restaurant has an international Swedish decor.  My ticket before tip was $11.23."}, {"review_id": "YtLWE_UHdz7FZy1WreVXog", "user_id": "s5Jq60VqDJEZeyh0BxfFBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Dear God that's good!

We all had the Swedish pancakes (order a side of Lingonberry jam to smoother the cakes), and several other breakfast staples....all very good and authentic. Since we were at a true Scandinavian restaurant (a food trend not necessarily sweeping the nation....this is a must experience) we ordered a small samplings of the Swedish meat balls. They were very good and had a unique hint of a clover type spice....man I would order a big 'ol bowl of these for dinner.Great breakfast places are few and far between, this is a great breakfast restaurant. The atmosphere is fun, they offer a buffet if you can't make your mind up and, want to try it all. They also offer lunch and dinner options.

My 10 year old eats like a man and he said everything was so good! It's a large restaurant, so I haven't been here where I ever had to wait in line to be seated. Been here twice so far and had the brunch on both occasions. So I can't really say or speak for the other menu items.The brunch gets replenished fairly quick and they bring you plates each time. So there aren't a pile of plates you can just go up and grab. I try to grab a little of everything, but find myself getting full so quick still. It's like I have to pace myself and make sure to grab what I really want to eat first, or I won't have room for it at all.It's kind of a hidden gem and goes un noticeable if you aren't familiar with it. This place is definitely great for the family even something spontaneous for a Sunday brunch without breaking your pockets."}, {"review_id": "UcFZbVkZVb3EA2Ssxx3jUA", "user_id": "5hbs6TwGyT2YQKeN3xef_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/9/2015", "text": "The key to my heart is a big ole honkin' stack of the infamously amazing Swedish pancakes that  have made a long-lasting name for themselves in the Rockford and surrounding area.  Perhaps you've been dazzled by some of those fancy Swedish pancakes with all the bells and whistles, but if you want the most fundamentally delectable Swedish pancakes that will rock you to your core then you have no choice but to come to Stockholm Inn.  Of course there are plenty of other dishes that are served here, but the pancakes are, without a doubt, the best items on the menu.I have been going to Stockholm Inn since I was a young girl - my dad and I always used to come and shovel the pancakes into our growling bellies...so when we met up again this last weekend we settled into our old habits and shoveled those pancakes into our mouths as if it was our last meal on this earth...speaking of which, I'd happily eat these pancakes as my last meal on earth.  You gotta believe me when I say these are amazing; I've been living in the  Chicago area for many years and never have I found a breakfast joint that serves better Swedish pancakes than Stockholm Inn - that's saying a lot.Personally, I also love the atmosphere in Stockholm Inn because it's like nowhere else I've been to.  There are Swedish ornaments and unique designs (as well as an awesomw gift shop with cool trinkets) all over the restaurant which make it a very sweet and comfortable place to enjoy a meal with family and friends.  No matter who I have brought to Stockholm Inn it's always been a smash hit - I couldn't imagine ever having a bad experience here.  All the people that frequent must agree with me because it's always jam-packed in here.  It's especially busy on the weekends when families and yes, many elderly couples, come here to enjoy their pancakes and coffee...and fresh squeezed orange juice (yummy!).The other sweet part of the deal when eating a little sumpin' sumpin' here is that it's extremely cheap!  You can get a stack of 4 thick Swedish pancakes for only $5!!!  That's totally unheard of - $5 for pancakes that  fill you up for hours on end?  Heck yes.  It's my favorite breakfast place for many reasons and if you give it half a chance I'm sure it can work its way into your heart too.  Oh on a sidenote - there is a breakfast buffet available on the weekends and although I've never actually gotten the items from the buffet I know that it's quite a popular choice so if that tickles your fancy then go right ahead an indulge yourselves.  There's never too much of a good thing, especially at Stockholm Inn."}, {"review_id": "76nQNAGgR4UZUOnprrliKA", "user_id": "wOjfO16UaVPsMdlBgswGag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "Love this restaurant.
