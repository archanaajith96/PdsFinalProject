I stopped by not once, but twice during my stay in Billings. During the first (drinks only) the bartender was very attentive and knowledgeable. Because of that experience, I decided to stop by for dinner, as well. When I arrived toward the end of the busy dinner service, the bar top was nearly full. After grabbing one of the last bar stools, I found I was surrounded by regulars, which is always a good sign. I ordered the Ramen of the Day along with a Penicillin to drink. Both were delicious, quality food and drinks. LPT: The bartenders are exceptionally innovative and will pair the perfect cocktail with any entree if asked."}, {"review_id": "Owf4zV7F4LodboHG3AAxHA", "user_id": "F7cs_XVKw5al8XB3LD6csw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "What happened??When you redecorated did you decide to practice pretension and forget that you are in business to serve lovely food that feels and tastes as if it's cooked with commitment and compassion to your public? I was dumbfounded by the whole lack of service from the servers too. I'm a patron of your establishment from the first week you opened your doors. You are one of my favorite restaurants in the nation. My waitress told me how your kitchen had \"improved\" the apple crisp. Please consider going back to the old way. The next time I fly into town, I'll be back; hopefully I can then delete this post. This was hard to write and even harder to realize I might never get to enjoy again what made Walker's great, exciting, \"lovely meals filled with love."}, {"review_id": "ZcKzbcVQtg-MoANNxAXg8g", "user_id": "NdQI8zj4y3t2gSDGjt63aw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "Wanted to check out Walkers after the remodel. The interior looks great and those ridiculous barb wire lights are gone. The service was excellent and attentive, but the food was quite disappointing. We ordered the deviled eggs appetizer and it was very good, a bit strange and too salty, but an interesting combo of flavors. Unfortunately, the entrees both bombed. We had the curry dish and the meatloaf. I asked not to have the gravy on the meatloaf because I cannot eat mushrooms. I should have asked if they could do some other type of gravy or sauce, but the waitress didn't offer, so I didn't ask. My mistake, because the meatloaf, while tasty, was as dry as the Sahara desert and since I was only offered ketchup when it was dropped off I regretted getting it. C'mon, do you mean to tell me that a pre-cooked item like meatloaf can't have a quick sauce or gravy whipped up in 20 minutes to accompany it? Especially considering it was as dry as shoe leather. The curry was oddly sour and the rice was slightly undercooked (not just firm but crunchy). The sourness overpowered the rest of the flavors, not that the curry flavor itself was prominent. This just wasn't a satisfying experience."}, {"review_id": "ED84SruTZT9rJqywhQ9ttA", "user_id": "u3FTE7Otx_wwlz-mBWg0fw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I am really impressed with the new vibe and menu at Walkers.  It is a pleasant upgrade to a classic restaurant.  I eat there every time I'm in Billings and you should also."}, {"review_id": "CS9mUK1S9jLpYABC4MXc_A", "user_id": "Snx3Sc8ZOty-z-cPgyI8Ew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "The most fabulous drinks and food!

They have always offered the most genuine and versatile cuisine and service. Having added Nick Steen to their staff to perfect their dishes was their most ideal move! He not only brings classic and exquisite taste to the menu, he brings authenticity to each dish with a personal and profound touch! The team of walkers is a cordial and hospitable team that attends to each individual customer's taste and preference.

Aside from the post-Halloween creeper who stared at us from the window we were sitting next to, it was a solid four-star night. First, the atmosphere here is nice, and it's not too loud to have normal conversation. We sat in the bar area and enjoyed great service and lively enough company, but not so lively that it detracted from our experience. After perusing the impressive wine and drink list (there are some tough finds and interesting choices here!), we started with a couple of glasses of wine and the Roasted Squash and White Bean Hummus and Bacon Wrapped Dates. The dates were far too sweet for my taste, but the hummus was absolutely delicious! Super smooth and full of flavor, and paired with toasty pita bread. Yum! Our entrees were also really good. I had Walkers Famous Bourbon Street Linguine and by friend had the  Coconut Red Curry. The andouille sausage in my dish could definitely have been spicier (note to Walkers: check out the andouille from Red Neck Sausage out of Kalispell! It's delish, and added bonus: it's local!), but overall, the flavors were great! Nicely balanced noodle to protein ratio, and a really well flavored red sauce with a little kick. My friend really enjoyed her curry as well.Our server was attentive, but not overly so, which is always appreciated. I did feel it was a *little* overpriced for the area and portions. While that wouldn't keep me away from coming back while in the area, it wouldn't be a regular joint for me if I lived in Billings. Would recommend if looking to spend a little more or splurge, and have a nice dinner."}, {"review_id": "1J_cWjXig4luCDdhFMmiRw", "user_id": "ZOLwJmjpdOfqUAX-2k57yw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Imagine a dining experience that will surprise and delight your palate every time.  Nick and Collin bring ebullience to their kitchen and it infuses every dish they serve.  The menu is replete with comfort foods such as pot roast or meatloaf but also offers fresh seafood such as walleye or grouper-- depending on the catch of the day.  Pork belly tacos from the appetizer menu are a meal in themselves.  You'll always find the best steak here, but what is most appreciated about Walkers is their adventure with flavor -- never stuck in the same old menu.

And experience with Large Plates.  We usually nosh on small plates and have a cocktail.The dining experience was just as good as the Tapas Bar.6 Stars for Service (Ryan was amazing). 4.5 stars for food.  It's very hard for me to give 5 stars anway, so don't be shocked by this.  It has to be absolutely perfect.  So, why 4 stars for food?  The special catch of the day was a Hawaiian Barracuda.  Which was supposed to be served medium rare/medium.  Steak like, almost like a mild swordfish.  But it came out over cooked. Medium Well +.  Which made it somewhat dry and not a lot of flavor.  The Basmati rice was great with it.. but we ordered fish, not rice. We didn't send it back, because it was OK.  Not terrible, but not amazing. The other 4 dishes and apps: Mahi and Spaghetti squash 5 stars, Flank Steak 5 stars, NY Strip 5 stars and the pasta special Pancetta Alfredo over Tagliatelle also 4.5 stars.  Great Caesar salads, bacon wrapped dates and the brussel sprouts were all great!So, with all that greatness why not 5?  I explain it this way.  If you're telling the story of your dining experience and you use the word \"but\", it means it's not perfect.  \"The meal, service, drinks and ambiance where awesome!  But, the fish was slightly over cooked.\"  I also don't measure any restaurant against another, but on its own merit. Every place is unique and have is own spin on a dish.  Try to find Pad Thai in 2 places that tastes the same. Each is unique.BUT..

We were there on a recent Friday night, and for such a nice evening, there were very few patrons. The decor is upscale and kind of funky, yet the cliental were for the most part seniors. The cocktails were very good, and as it worked out, they were probably the highlight. We tried the mussels, and they tasted rather old and dried out. We also tried a special pasta that they were promoting. It was ok, and better than the mussels, but nothing special. In general, it seemed like this place was well past its prime, and is now relying on older folks that are willing to spend money for average food, at a place that has a nice decor, with a quiet atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "4ZyEqLicyZKnyyPOTP6vGA", "user_id": "6dhdrbPoC93qEGaFEHhwJQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "I hate writing this but Walkers was always our \"go to\" place for Anniversaries, birthdays, and special occasions. To me it was the benchmark for good dining in Billings but that has all changed. We hadn't been there since they had closed to remodel. Meatloaf ... why dear god why would they change something so tried and true as the damn meatloaf? It is obvious that with the change in decor came a new chef and new management, maybe new owners even. I don't know the story but dang you guys messed up. Mashed potatoes with the meatloaf was your staple. Anyone you'd talk to would recommend it but you guys had to change it. Service was subpar. We had to beg for bread.
