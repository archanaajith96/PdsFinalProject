I would really give this place 1.5 stars but I'm hangry so it gets 1.My family & I came in when the place was less than half empty. Many of the tables were full of dirty dishes. The place  is in an old gas station and the cleanliness of the bathroom reflects that. The complimentary tea is a nice touch. It was also all we had to sustain us for close to an hour which was less nice. After taking our orders he returned 30 minutes later to tell me that they didn't have the ingredients for the stuffed tofu I ordered. I re-ordered a crispy crepe, which is supposed to have vegetables & tofu inside of it.Finally, finally, the food arrived, though no apology for the wait accompanied it. Most of the food was average-good but mine. The vegetables in my crispy crepe were...bean sprouts. Loads and loads of bean sprouts with a few pieces of broccoli thrown in. Guess what was missing? Tofu. What did I originally order, that couldn't be made as they were missing an ingredient? Stuffed tofu. Clearly I should have connected the dots as the guy wasn't going to spell it out for me. I wanted to ask him for more broccoli but he never checked up on us so I settled for my bean sprout crepe & left hungry, as did the rest of my family. We won't be back (granted we live in Los Angeles but still)"}, {"review_id": "fZGDLgKZ3oRs9boLtHZm4w", "user_id": "Xb3DBMmZxJRCqmb64gAD1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "Stopped in here on one of our last nights in Fort Smith and was craving Pho. Don't let this little hole in the wall place fool you, it's all delicious. The inside is a typical Vietnamese restaurant with some interesting decor (clutter) but don't let that deter you. Everything is made in house and so fresh and delicious. We will definitely be back every other year. :-)"}, {"review_id": "dDXb4OXMdBjlVhdWkNpZLw", "user_id": "70mH6WOn8vqtQ_Wklgbe2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Cute little place.

At first glance the old gas station appearance might seem sketchy but don't be thrown off. This is the mom and pop restaurant for authentic Vietnamese cuisine.

From the hot tea brought with the menus to the dessert, both of which come at no additional charge, you're treated with service unknown to most places.

Its 2017. No one carries cash. When I see cash only places I immediately think they are trying to not pay taxes. Even if thats not true, it alienates customers. No one carries cash with them anymore.

Smith that made me want to go there immediately. \"No checks or cards accepted, cash only, inside a somewhat dirty gas station and the owners speak little if any English.\" Sign me up now! I always feel like Tony Bourdain going into some hole in the wall establishment.I ordered my Bun Thit Nuong of some sort and a wonderful Viet gentleman brought out what I consider twig tea. It's a light brown color, light in flavor and hey, free tea? Really? I like this place already. After I ordered I sat patiently and my meal arrived.My dish looked great and I was handed another dish of tapioca like pudding with banana and toasted peanuts. Did I pay for dessert? Nope, just another add on.As I used chopsticks to tear though my noodle bowl I was a little frustrated that my noodles were hot instead of room temperature but hey, nothing is perfect and there's probably only one person in the kitchen making all this stuff. All that I had was great. It's not the best noodle bowl I've ever had but for less than $10 I got a phenomenal meal even if it wasn't the greatest portion size I've ever eaten.The tapioca pudding was great and the ripe banana flavor in it was great. This was my most memorable meal in Ft. Smith and if you don't eat here you should start. I love the nuance that comes from a nonstandard restaurant. I like it on many levels. It's niche, polite, non-chain and I personally love supporting a small family establishment. Well done and keep up the good work."}, {"review_id": "xGYsgAdW86pGdh6BWLTSLg", "user_id": "wbP7PIek_flwDBfNpS8NKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2017", "text": "Based on how it looks just driving by it wouldn't look like a place you'd want to go, but honestly the food is amazing.
