I recently moved to Fargo from Minneapolis and, ya know, there are some decent places to eat. But Luna blew me away! The service was above and beyond amazing. Lactose and I do not get along but yet I wanted a cheese plate. The chef was so kind and considerate and made an all goat/sheep plate for us. She came out and gave such great detail about the cheeses as well as the charcuterie. And it was BOMB.This was all during lunch so I can only imagine how great dinner will be.OH and they have GOAT milk icecream!! What! You can for sure tell its goat but it's delicious! I will be back. Maybe every day!"}, {"review_id": "u8LmRxwYJ5ySgUK1a7YAtw", "user_id": "NN-KPQLLWhscq_l4WWvT0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "I had dinner at Luna and I have to say, As a New Yorker that has traveled  the world and have had some great meals, my dinner at Luna is among my 10 ten best meals!  The service was amazing.  The popovers are to die for...The brown butter ice cream blew me away.  I can't wait to go back ."}, {"review_id": "2iMIlwIVYLE3vGHXoRaOfg", "user_id": "C-ObuoSf6iXBnc0MgAJBrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/23/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My wife and I stopped by for lunch on a Saturday and I ordered the BLT, fantastic, I mean really fantastic.My wife ordered the broccoli soup and green salad and was very impressed as well.

The desserts were the coup de gras! The waitress was an absolute delight who gave us the history of Luna and clearly described the menu.  The decor is a family quaint restaurant but the food is 4-5 stars."}, {"review_id": "wlb6O9Wa6JvJfM0OX02TfQ", "user_id": "WtIYArer3a3XKrTCz9FHiw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "This was my fav place in town. Delicious coffee and great food on small plates so you really can order just a healthy snack if that is what you want. I think they have some larger plates too but I never quite get past the small ones. :)However, in the past 6 months, I have observed the service to be so poor on repeated visits that I just cant bring myself to go there anymore.  I noticed that the Hornbachers one block north has a Caribou coffee in it. When I'm in the mood for fancy coffee while out on a walk, I'll stop there and have already found happier places to go with dates."}, {"review_id": "8BOt5BakosMljJLE_P7iMg", "user_id": "onifVFJO7PXNCKs0wXpofA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Food and service is excellent and everything tastes amazing.

If you're looking for a legit place to impress yourself, especially some one Special WHO LOVES FOOD and nothing else in a restaurant this place is hands down thee place to execute such plan. Having traveled  all over Europe and experience different cuisine and atmosphere- I def always feel like I'm in some legit restaurant in the  country side of France or Italy  who count on show casing the quality of their food and nothing else. But,  besides the quality of the food, the place is intimate and classy. I haven't seen any riffraffs in the restaurant - only people who appreciate good food and quality time with whomever their dining with. THANK YOU LUNA for making Fargo diverse and exuding open-mindedness through your very unique creations."}, {"review_id": "weoX9_7mtjii3SLMktMHqg", "user_id": "3uq9oaHDYqSt_klPmgR1OA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/14/2017", "text": "Our experience was wonderful,!

The shop is a cheese counter, coffee shop, and restaurant all in one.The staff is always very helpful when picking out cheeses. They have an extensive selection and they assist you in building a cheese plate that will work well together. The items that I have brought home have been a hit at parties!I always stock up on local butter and farm fresh eggs while in in as well.

Went there for happy hour for drink specials and the 1/2 off cheese tray. They have a unique beer selection that you don't find in any regular restaurant. However this is not a regular restaurant! My wife had a couple of glasses of wine from their extensive wine selections. The cheese plate was an awesome selection of unique cheeses, nuts with rosemary, dried fruits and amazing breads. Everything was so good that we stayed for dinner and we were not disappointed! The Seared Skrei Cod was amazing. The morel mushrooms sautéed in butter and truffles were to die for and I almost did. I reached over to take a piece from my wife and she threatened to stab me! She always shares but not this time! I had the Orange Fatty Marlin Crudo which was equally amazing. Kudos to chef Ryan and the rest of the staff. Service was great. Very attentive but not overbearing. Perfect!

Luna has always been a great spot for that. Unfortunately for me, I stopped in at 4:05 pm, which is apparently too late. I was told they \"don't do coffee\" after 4, only dinner. Server and manager said I was in luck though, as they still had some sitting in one of the airpots. At the risk of sounding overly picky, I declined a cup of old brew when server confirmed airpot batch had been sitting all day. I was confused - based on experience, coffee doesn't seem that complex to make. Especially for a place with both drip and espresso machines and that advertises coffee on their exterior sign. I asked if I could order dinner and was told \"yep.\" I asked what if I wanted coffee with my dinner. Poor server gal didn't know. Oh well, maybe the food is good."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/luna-fargo-fargo?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
