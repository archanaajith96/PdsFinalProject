Becuaee one thing is for certain: Yankees don't know how to work the pit. So you have to trust me when I say I was damn surprised to walk into this joint for a few good reasons: 1.) The Q is flipping phenomenal 2.) The sides are damn good too, and they're creative 3.) The atmosphere is just cool and laid back. For starters, the BBQ here is on point. It's tender as hell, juicy, full of flavor, and the sauce is sweet with a little kick. I had the pulled pork sandwich and some of my cousin's brisket. And I can't say enough how delicious it all was.We also had some fried boudin balls that I've got to talk about. Look, boudin is good. But fry it up in a ball like a hush puppy?!? Good God almighty, I love the South. These things are the best damn appetizer I've had. I mean that in all sincerity. Get this app, you won't regret it one iota. Lastly, this place is just busy for a reason: it's damn good food. You gotta eat here.

I enjoy all types of BBQ and this appeals to the purest smoker in me. The Brisket was Smokey and flavorful without being dry. The Mac n cheese was creamy and pared really well with the brisket. The staff was also very friendly and helpful in explaining the options. My only complaint was I saw a Cheerwine seat outside but no cheerwine in the soda machine inside. I don't also drink southern branded soda, but when I do, it's cheerwine."}, {"review_id": "YMI__-hS8cDp8Uu1gRWuBg", "user_id": "aeKThfXhbSGoCyAkhzys-g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Pretty underwhelming for a barbecue joint in the South, where I expect better BBQ. The brisket sandwich was just unremarkable meat on an unremarkable bun, and the meat itself was somehow very fatty while being incredibly dry. It certainly didn't taste like it had been seasoned. At all.There was waaaay too much cheez sauce in the mac and cheese, and the mac itself was undercooked. Not in the \"we all have our opinion and maybe we just happen to like ours on the firm side\" sense, but in the \"it actually crunches when you chew it\" sense. The lady behind the counter was rushed and kind of rude, even though it wasn't that busy. We asked two question about the food, and she rolled her eyes before answering each. She certainly didn't have any interest in concealing the fact that she was bored as fuck by all these jerks who expect her to ring up their food orders. (She was also muttering about \"Yankees\" after somehow managing to overcome her disgust at taking our dirty Yankee money.) Having to stand in another line to get a beer after standing in the first line and run the same credit card again didn't win any points, either. The beer list was good and the guy behind the beer counter managed to be polite, but I'm not planning at forking out any Yankee money for disappointing BBQ next time I pass through Jackson. It's a state capital in the South. There's got to be decent barbecue somewhere at a place that doesn't make a point of being rude to customers."}, {"review_id": "O-LC8QnuKx8AA8Abtx7_VQ", "user_id": "0s-JB0unikTv-VfPADm3Rw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This place has great food, atmosphere and service.

The brisket plate and brisket tacos were good and the sides were above average.  The 2 sauces were both quite nice with a mustard based sauce and more traditional sweeter sauce which I proceeded to blend into a combination of my own preference.  The only real negative I have to bring up is they are a Pepsi products establishment ughhhh I just can't see any self respecting Southern joint using Pesi over Coca-Cola as I'm a Coke man myself and HATE Pepsi.  Fortunately I drink mostly unsweet iced tea these days so they do a great job of brewing that.  They have a lot of outdoor patio seating and less indoor seating and this is obviously a VERY popular venue in the area as it was packed during a late lunch when I arrived.  Overall I would definitely suggest making a stop in here if you find yourself in the area and they also have a fantastic beer selection to enjoy."}, {"review_id": "29gWFqu2OZU4qu8cUG4Qjg", "user_id": "qMMUBzhArKwN34VxlAqwHQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Atmosphere 4 stars, service 4 stars - Food (Taste, quality, price) 1 star.I have been all around the country eating BBQ and I can say this does not make the cut for BBQ. The ribs were dry and had a foul taste, the brisket was very dry and definitely didn't have the fat trimmed, the pulled pork was alright (a little dry) as for the sides - the beans I took 2 bites just to ensure I was correct about my first bite - I didn't like these at all. The slaw was good - the price for all of this was a bit high for the quality I received. I would try it if your wanting BBQ in Jackson as they are the only ones open late in the area.

Hands down my favorite place overall. The atmosphere is so chill, great place for families and groups with the big benches outside. Also really aesthetic lighting outside so it's never too late to sit outside. They even have a trivia night once a week that is a great time.  But most Importantly they have the best bbq nachos I've ever had. Big hearty chunks of smoked meat and lots of fresh tasting toppings. They do add a hunk of sour cream so if you don't like that you'll have to let them know. The barbecue sauce is just delicious. They're served on a bed of thick corn chips that don't get soggy and crack under weight so you can take your time. Serving size is enough to share. Absolutely must try."}, {"review_id": "HTzs10Wea6GsNTOVuMngLA", "user_id": "SAfNyiLVgPZzp_aGpXnfwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "I'm guilty. I am a barbecue fanatic. And in the last decade I've been to more than 500 barbecue restaurants and shacks across America. On a recent drive from New Orleans to Monroe we decided to detour and head to Downtown Jackson to check out this well rated restaurant. And I have to say it was worth every mile we drove to get here.  Having visited Jackson many times I can say that no other barbecue around compares to this. The food here can hold its own against most other barbecue places of the country.  We did a pretty good job sampling many items in our mini feast but I'd like to come back and try more.Sausage Plate:  This small pieces of sausage were packed with flavor and nearly melted in your mouth. Slapping them inside the crackers with a slice of cheddar cheese was a meal in itself.Pitmaster Sampler HighlightsHalf Chicken: I knew what I was getting into when my knife made its 1st slice into the bird and juices spewed out all over the place. This chicken was moist, tender and loaded with flavor.Brisket: The chefs did a phenomenal job shedding the fat, but maintaining the brisket's flavor.  The brisket was so tender then you didn't even need to use your knife. Ribs: No need to use your fork or knife on these ribs because the meat fell right off the bone and was well seasoned.Potato Salad & French Fries: These sides are slightly better than average, but didn't blow us away. If they were incredible like a few other barbecue places in America then we would have given a 5- star.Banana Foster Pudding: Hands down this desert is one of the best desserts I've ever had. I would drive two hours out of the way again just to eat this.  If you've ever been to Dreamland in Alabama imagine a dessert that's better than their banana pudding by a lot. This is what they've achieved here. If you're looking for good barbecue this place must be on your radar. And don't forget to order the dessert. You also find a safe, clean and inviting restaurant with wonderful service."}, {"review_id": "L9Q0Evl6ajJFOghD46Hj9Q", "user_id": "8yZ_wOm_vMAETxMG289PQA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I had the sausage and cheese plate, very unacceptable.

It just makes so much sense to combine quality BBQ with quality beer and they do it really well here. Their menu is quite enticing. I wanted to try everything, but ended up going the classical route. I am so glad that I did.Their pork ribs are no joke and were easily the star of the show for me. The accompanying greens were great too. Only disappointment was in their fried green tomatoes. These I felt were just ok. They were crisped perfectly, but were lacking in flavor, even with the accompanying sauce. Speaking of sauce, they have 3 to choose from: a southern style sweet one, a spicy habanero sauce and a mustard sauce. Sauce at bbq joints can be hit or miss and often times just come down to personal preference. Theirs here though were a-ok in my book. Each added a different dimension of flavor and I wish I had gotten some to take with me.This is an excellent place to grab BBQ and a pint or two. There is no question I would happily return here when in Jackson again."}, {"review_id": "S1juq5wyWdS-hohg-bg4Nw", "user_id": "CJc05fUtyEJJHlN3nN7xvA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "1st of all, I have to quit looking so much and relying alot on Trip Advisor and or yelp reviews.This Local BBQ Joint on some of the Worst Roads I have ever seen bustles with the crowds trying to get in. For what I ask? The Potato Salad was the only think I'd give better than a 4.I had the ribs which were Fatty as fat could be. Sure they were Big enough, but with a mouth full of fat why not. The Mac and Cheese was one step shy of Soupy, which another reviewer had mentioned. I should have believed him. The Potato Salad was decent. Not great but OK. Wifey had the pulled pork sandwich with same sides and had to doctor the poor thing up just to get it down.As for me I want to smell like a BBQ Pit when I come out of a cool place like this. Nope. There was NO SMOKE. Just on the rack ribs and pulled pork. What a waste of 40 bucks.As a side Note Mississippi should be embarrassed by the roads in this area. I'm telling you, don't take a new car, or a car with expensive wheels down these 8 inch deep 3 foot wide Pot Holes, that are every 50 feet. Don't be fooled. I love BBQ.
