A brightly lit, and warm environment with classic flavors and nothing else.  Don't expect toppings, Sunday specials, or fancy bowls.  It's all about the ice cream here.  I tried several samples and stressed over what flavors to choose from.  I decided on hazelnut, and savored every melting bite of smooth, hazel flavor. Pitango boasts an excellent view of the area, and sitting at a window seat, indulging in gelato while people watching is a treat within a treat.  Hats off to Pitango Gelato for bringing a little bit of Italy to Fells Point."}, {"review_id": "UDt-biNpw9zUPVt0mYUxAw", "user_id": "K8hpx0cE8CObgzuf_ZQ7dQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Pitango is one of my favorite spots in Fells Point. I'm not a fan of overly-sweet desserts, so their subtle gelato flavors really hit the spot for me! I usually get a mix of 2-3 different flavors whenever I go. I would recommend the black tea, fior di latte, or grapefruit. They also have seasonal flavors so their menu is always changing. If you're an avid coffee drinker, I would recommend the affogato or Americano.Pitango is on the pricier end for gelato, but it's definitely worth it. I always make sure to stop by whenever I'm in the neighborhood."}, {"review_id": "MdJ4uR7ZcDYhvuDKrSwl2g", "user_id": "q4sbRMAS69Aq7_eWv_nc1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "5 stars gelato!!!I can't count how many times I've been here, and how many friends I've brought to this place! This gelato lactated at the heart of fell's point offers so many good flavors and memories! My favorite ice cream flavors there are black tea, green tea and sur del lago (chocolate). Their ice cream is not too sweet but full of flavor. You feel the creaminess in their gelato and awesome freshness in the sorbet. You can do half and half in a cup too in case you can't make up your mind!

A truly top-notch gelateria, in every sense: the flavor, the ambiance, the conscientious sourcing of their ingredients, and the location. I was VERY sad that the portion size was so small because by the time I'd walked 3 blocks, I was basically finished with my small cone.  So go large, if in doubt.My favorite flavor is always chocolate chip and I got this with a refreshing raspberry sorbet, which was incredible.

This could be one of the reasons you should taste the delicious treats on offer here. Pitango takes gelato/sorbet seriously and you can tell everything they do is with love. Speaking of love- I LOVED both the chocolate gelato and sorbet that I had. Everyone in my group devoured what they'd ordered. If I were local, this place would be in the rotation for sure. The seating area is small with just a handful of tables. I think most people take the gelato to go. The workers were friendly and informative."}, {"review_id": "K8KMDLS1n83Yuk0Fox6jvQ", "user_id": "3_TvMHpwINjyK7DwRBd5Vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Best gelato in Baltimore. I am ashamed to say that I have gotten all the sizes from here at one point or another...including the kilo of gelato (which to be fair I was sharing with 4 people so don't judge me). If you've been to Pitango you'll understand that a small may seem acceptable at other places, but not here. The flavors of gelato rotate daily (weekly?) and are rich and flavorful, whether its gelato or sorbet. My wife and daughter all went and got the pistachio and hazelnut flavors in a small. My daughter was obsessed with the pistachio flavor. Also, all the flavors are light! You don't feel heavy after eating it. My personal go-to for the past few months is the affogato with the sur de lago, which was their dark chocolate sorbet. Delicious! It goes so well together, and it's the best of both worlds-coffee AND chocolate. Lastly, they started a rewards program, so for every gelato you buy, you get a star! 10 stars gets you a free one- it doesn't get better than that."}, {"review_id": "JqrX7wyZNzGHFC3x9eRIDQ", "user_id": "q3lv7obAox0Flfv7DRIS0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I was on a coffee hunt while visiting my friend KJ in Fells Point, and Pitango had a sandwich board outside advertising their affogatos. Gelato AND espresso? The absolute best of both worlds! They had a ton of fun and interesting gelato options, and the nice man behind the counter offered up unlimited samples. I'm usually a sorbetto kind of girl, though on this visit I stuck with the creamier options as I was intent on an espresso pour over. I sampled the halveh with pistachio, which was basically their house \"fior di latte\" sweet cream ice cream with chunks of pistachios and halvah made from sesame seeds. It was amazing, though not one to have chunks in my coffee, I opted for the cardamom gelato affogato. HOLY CRAP IT WAS GOOD. The cardamom ice cream was spicy and flavorful without being overwhelming, and balanced out the bitterness of the espresso. And at only $5, way better than anything you'd get at Starbucks! Next time I'm in the area, I'll definitely be back to get that sorbet!"}, {"review_id": "QucqfI3GGF24Q7esrA29tw", "user_id": "hDGoHzlGwspqlE_UkZ2Vtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Absolutely delicious and highly recommend!

So, naturally, I visited Pitango on a hot and humid summer night - and, as expected, it hit the spot!Despite the inevitable crowd at the popular Gelato spot on a weekend night, the kind servers offered to let me sample a few of their flavors before making my decision (I mean...I take my Gelato decisions VERY seriously!). Although everything I sampled was quite delicious (namely, the Pistacio, the Chocolate Hazelnut, and the Chocolate Chip flavors), I opted for a scoop of the Chocolate Chip, and for a scoop of the Chocolate Hazelnut in a cone (you're allowed 2 flavors in a cone, or 3 flavors in a cup).WOW, the consistency was perfect: it was light, soft and creamy; not icy or \"melty,\" at all. The flavor was amazing, as well - the Chocolate Hazelnut was very rich, and reminded me of Nutella, while the (vanilla) Chocolate Chip was so simple, yet so perfect, in it's way.Yes, it was phenomenal; yes, it was delectable...my only problem? I wished they had given more! Okay, confession: I have a VERY big sweet tooth...but still - the portion did seem rather small to me, and considering the price, I just wished they had been a little more generous in their \"scoops\"! Regardless - I really do value quality of quantity, and I'm so pleased I got to enjoy some of this delicious Gelato.Without a doubt, I'll certainly be back to Pitango...but if you catch me buying two cups or cones...do me a favor, and don't judge! :)"}, {"review_id": "Cui5tArNHg-JBRKVjNGi7Q", "user_id": "qG9znyIMOcetZhtlewrIEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Pitango gelato is definitely worth a trip to go to.  I had already been to Pitango Bakery + Cafe, so I knew that this was going to be great. It is a little bit pricey for gelato/sorbet, but honestly totally worth it. Their flavors are incredible, and it's made super well.  All of the flavors I've tried are packed full of flavor.  I'm more of a fan of fruity flavors, so I usually get two flavors - mango and fior di latte.  The fior di latte is kind of a creamy, milky flavor.  They suggest you pair the fior di latte with more chocolate or nut flavors, but I really love it with the mango.  One of my favorite Taiwanese desserts is mango pudding, and this flavor combination reminds me of the dessert.  I definitely recommend trying it if you haven't before!I've also tried the local strawberry and pineapple, and those are both super flavorful.

Didn't want something to weigh me down but wanted to be satisfied - Hello Pitango. They have about 20 flavors from orange dark chocolate to Black Tea. Wasn't sure how I was going to chooseA small of Mojito and Banana did it. The mojito was light on the tongue with specks of mint. Not too limey but just that right quick taste of a sweet tart. That one is actually worth a full cup. However I love bananas and this one reminds me of freezing a banana until it is just frozen, then blending it with a little cream. Just right for banana lovers. The space is fresh with coffee options and pastries. Service was good also - Can I take ya'll back home with me and place you on a little corner in town?  Thanks Fells Point for a wonderful food experience.
