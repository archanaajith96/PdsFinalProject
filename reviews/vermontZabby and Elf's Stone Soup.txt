They have a wonderful hot buffet (sell by the weight) everyday, custom sandwiches, fabulous homemade breads, tasty soups, and great looking desserts (although I've always been too full to try any). The kitchen and counter help is friendly and food options are plentiful. Sturdy wooden tables. Get your own water and bus your own table. It is very popular but the tables turnover quickly. Great value."}, {"review_id": "Jqh26U4HQOZPs1i4KoszvA", "user_id": "OazSm_Rq_PX4_GXO2EqKGQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "They had a turkey burger on the menu. The cashier asked me how I wanted it cooked. \"Medium well.\"She says \"that might be a problem let me ask the chef.\"She comes back and says they can't cook it anything but rare.\"Why would you ask me how I want my meat cooked if you're going to deny anything except rare?\"Girl is embarrassed at how stupid she sound and goes and gets the chef.The chef is some 40 year old hippie douche who preceded to berate me about how they don't cook meat anything except rare because it ruins it and that he fundamentally cannot cook my burger. He then tells me to order something else. Legit the douchiest interaction I've ever had with someone in the service industry.I repeat the question to him asking why they asked me how I wanted my meat cooked and he has some tantrum like a child and storms off back to the kitchen. I also mention that never in my life have I heard of someone cooking rare ground turkey.Preceding this multiple customers using the salad bar were charged absurd prices for their salads and stood in line to complain.The place also only sells overpriced $4+ juice blends as their only drinks.Terrible restaurant with childish, incompetent staff. Poor service. Overpriced food."}, {"review_id": "XWUbjdikWnt0xpJsXgePkw", "user_id": "Dq_Jkpx4xpbh4iofayOr6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/24/2016", "text": "Stone Soup is a Burlingtonite's favorite place to get a healthy hearty meal. Filled with fresh pastries, and offering hot and cold buffet, it is a vegetarian's dream. The self-serve hot food and cold food buffet offered delicious self selected salads. I saw large dinner plates piled high with lettuce, sprouts, peppers and tofu. It looked delicious! And the jam filled thumbprints and the Russian wedding cakes looked so festive, crumbly and delicious!We had the special: 1/2 pound burger on rye bread with fried potato slices and blue cheese with beet salad. The burger was juicy, the beef was local. The sweet beets were tender cubes in a vinaigrette sauce. Neither of us liked the pungent blue cheese, so we left it to the side. We also order a sweet potato soup with bacon and corn. The soup came with a huge piece of fluffy bread. The soup was perfect for a cold December day: hearty, warm and chunks of bacon and kernels of starchy corn. They offer ever changing specials, $1 sale of day old cookies and bread. Definitely get a slice of pie or sweet zucchini bread. The cream cheese frosting on the bread was awesome! And I loved meeting my old college friend here with her hubby.Protip: No one takes your order, so you order at the register and if you order hot food or a special, the cook brings it by. Get here early because lunchtime gets packed. I saw several groups come in and leave due to lack of seating. We tried to finish up so other people can sit."}, {"review_id": "7axr9ZiL5X-ClOAjmozygw", "user_id": "Ee6y3lrEg_grbwbzl35-6g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Would have loved to sit down and eat but they only had one item up on the hot bar and were unable to make sandwiches at 11am...."}, {"review_id": "B6_UJSYswtSUVxtO6IJbxA", "user_id": "Par-pvTTNe3IbP8GFWr48w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Perfection! I'm judge-y about little things: iced tea, customer service past just getting the food, kitchen cleanliness. This little place sparkles with positive energy. The kitchen is totally open, obsessively shined, and neatly organized. Staff keeps an eye on you until you leave, very accommodating with take out containers and continued service. Best of all, the food is amazing. If you want to hang out, go off hours as seating can be tight in peak hours. Love the quiche; soups are always great, baked goods are stellar; they even have vegan options. And yes, the iced tea is artfully made, never day-old or cloudy."}, {"review_id": "iPOuxE45amshMQx8p_XkJA", "user_id": "NPg7t0lhJa1qwKH6A4xBaA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "It was packed when we arrived. There is a decent amount of seating here, and we were able to find a table just fine. There is a hot bar and a salad bar, lots of menu items, and desserts. There was a lot of vegan options for us here. We both wanted to split a soup and sandwich, but the only vegan soup that day was split pea and my inner child was at full peak. So we got a vegan BLT and I had cheese added, which was a great choice. We left with yummy vegan treats. The wait for food was long enough for my boyfriend to walk to rite aid and back. The staff was really friendly and never made my indecisive self aware of any annoyance."}, {"review_id": "7iGclKyp4mKCEUEzc8R5bg", "user_id": "-c1WXvMbYGLqHw946jiYDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "This place is awesome! Stopped in for a quick bite for lunch and it wound up being one of my favorite spots on my trip to Burlington. The decor was fun and inviting, the menu was nice and simple but had enough options, I didn't try anything from the food bar but everything in it looked delish! The baked goods all looked so fresh and appetizing. I had to get a few things to try. These goodies tasted like some of the best things you make yourself at home. So fresh! Stop in this place!

He was incredibly friendly. It was genuine friendliness. It wasn't fake! He was the real deal. That's one of my favorite things about Vermont. Everyone is so genuine.  He even went over to the kitchen area and came back with the selection of vegetarian samples for me to try.  The samples were even better than my main dish! I highly recommend this little gem.  I'll be back....that's for sure!

There seems to be a large emphasis on meat. I did have the vegan club, one of the three options for vegetarians and it was really delicious and filling. They had 3 soups that all had meat in them, too. Our friends ended up waiting a little too long for their food and the owner, I believe, brought us out fresh chicken wings to apologize for the wait. It was a wonderful gesture and they looked amazing (I couldn't try, but I also didn't have to wait ) there was a hair in my friends sandwich that she noticed after eating over half. All in all, it was super tasty and fresh, and the free wings made us feel valued."}, {"review_id": "6thQBV1i621Hh_RQZuINaw", "user_id": "gdPGT7UnRxFjisXIW_Hztg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/16/2016", "text": "The food here is so good and I love all the vegan food options.

There is also always at least one vegan baked good which I highly appreciate, love the Thumbprint and the brownie is pretty good too. I've been here a few times now and I love the food, the staff and the atmosphere. Not the cheapest place around though, and they don't have wifi so it's not the kind of place you can really hang out to get work done.

Stone Soup is no exception. I highly recommend checking this place out if you find yourself in downtown Burlington around lunchtime. Expect mouthwatering and rustic-looking desserts piled high on the counter, soups (whodathunkit), and a veggie-filled buffet (pay by the weight). The buffet boasts tofu and tempeh dishes along with simple veggies options like beets, build-your-own salads, wax beans, etc. All delicious. (a few could have used an extra wink of salt)One of my favorite features of Stone Soup is the cozy layout with tables tucked directly against the pull up garage door window on the front wall facing the street.
