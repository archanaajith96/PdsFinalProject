You know what really makes my mouth water? Their green chileles stew. Man, it's something I dream about. It was so good that I bought some Hatch Green Chilies hoping to replicate it but how can I? I've only eaten it once and I still remember the stew so clearly. Right amount of salt, meat, and chilies!Oh, the frontier burritos was bomb too! Ugh, can I say how much I love this place?! I wish we had New Mexican food in Cali!

Consistent good, affordable food otherwise. Nothing really great but everything is good. Tortilla soup: good. Burgers: good. Chicken strips: good. BLT: good. Frontier Burrito: good. You get the idea. A beloved ABQ staple that shows no signs of slowing down, even with the albatross of A.R.T. on its literal doorstep, not to mention the homeless.Speaking of.... I once observed a drunk?/homeless? man urinate on the bus stop right outside the window to Frontier, right in front of me; and he wasn't facing the other way, if you get my drift. Frontier retains security for such things, but they often don't do enough. All that aside, I enjoy the place for its charm, ambiance, and consistency."}, {"review_id": "Eed1_ymHn0Og8ocmVAhCVw", "user_id": "2q9uZNCCcK3CkuIYHt3rmA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Good college diner food exactly as crappy, cheap and delicious as you want it!  Don't tell your parents you eat here when they come to town or do like I do and take your teenager here for a grilled ham and cheese to prepare her for college life!  Lol!Hey, buy an extra portion or share your leftovers with the homeless people outside.  Be real folks, you can afford it.  Peace."}, {"review_id": "vPzYpc8FEbMedMqwlTHQkg", "user_id": "7KYXjipzX5U9VBIKRPP7DA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Yum!

Everyone has some sort of memory associated with Frontier. It's location across the street from UNM makes it a big draw for the student body - as well as it's affordable pricing! The great food, especially breakfast fare, and fantastic green chile keeps families coming back. It is open late night so you can get those cravings satisfied!This is the perfect blend of family place and student hang. There is literally something for everyone here! The big draw here is a toss up between the burritos and the giant cinnamon rolls called Frontier rolls. The Frontier rolls are literally the size of your face and dripping in butter, sugar, and cinnamon! You can even take cold ones home to heat up later! And don't forget to take home a dozen fresh made tortillas!"}, {"review_id": "zfORu5d_DR8KloIZGS4ZXg", "user_id": "W2zQjohtIrsZhEMgKFmd7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "We stopped here on a road trip and it almost made me stay!

It is that good. If you are in ABQ and haven't been to Frontier, you are missing out on an experience. Located right opposite to the main entrance to UNM, this is a go to place for most of the University people and locals around. Food: Breakfast burrito is this amazing combination of hashbrown, eggs and cheddar, with some green chile thrown in, and rolled into the softest tortilla. Slather it with some of the hot salsa available in a cauldron, and you are set. We also got some freshly squeezed orange juice, it was the best I have ever had in the US. At dinner, I went for a 1/2 order of enchiladas with chicken, cheese, onion wrapped in the freshest and softest flour tortilla, sides of lettuce, tomato, and rice, and topped off with a half & half of both red and green chile. I liked the red chile better, but FYI it's spicy. while you are at it, try the french fries. I don't know how, but it is definitely a gem. My husband went for the Frontier burrito, which was ginormous but amazing. The food was always so fresh and tasteful. I swear, if I was living there I would be here for every meal. 5/5Interior: It has a very interesting decor, with paintings hanging all around. And the restaurant runs for over a block with four or five large dining areas. You get your food from the counter and walk up to an empty table. It was buzzing with people both the times we went there. I would probably steer clear of the restrooms though, it can definitely do with a bit of upgrade and maintenance. 4/5Service: Amazing! When ordering the server at the counter asked us if we were sure about the orange juice as it had gone a bit tart and offered us a bit to taste. I was amazed. Generally, doesn't matter what the flavor is, they just give it. Even tart, it was evident the juice was fresh and tasty, so we went with it. The people there are always smiling and very welcoming. There's always multiple cleaning crew ensuring the tables are cleared off as soon as they are emptied. I was amazed. 5/5Price: Nothing can beat the price here. The breakfast burritos were like 6.50, OJ was a bit pricey at 3.25, but u must get the tortillas separately. They are worth every penny. The food is delicious, the price is affordable, the place is amazing. An experience. 5/5"}, {"review_id": "tzZU5rvLH5PtO1lWdHAXMg", "user_id": "CL_5mLtpGVZ2IWu9YG5Upw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Delicious food & great prices!

This gem is located across from UNM. Needless to say the inexpensive food draws lots of students & judging by their dress - instructors. Lunch for 2 was $20 not too shabby. There's something in the menu for everyone, it's tasty and portions are just right. So we'll be back for more.

This place took up the floorspace of at least 3 stores. It was also packed with college kids yearning for some New Mexican food! I ordered a breakfast burrito with all the meats (chicken, ham, bacon, sausage and adovado) along with a cinnamon roll. There was also not really a wait because they had around 6 cashiers open simultaneously which was great! I got my food within 10 minutes and as we ate I was surprised at the size of it! It was huge and much larger than expected and with that I expected a degradation in quality. But again to my surprise it was delicious! Each meat was cooked well and the cinnamon roll was nice and a little chewey (the way I like it) but not too sweet like Cinnabon. I would recommend this place for sure if you have never been here before or want some decent quick food for sitdown!"}, {"review_id": "FFOjx02Ha3T92DSH-lljCA", "user_id": "91AG5T53Cam2Ef8DCHTJvA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Came here for the sweet buns, basically a cinnamon roll.

I continue to return to The Frontier Restaurant.Its not about the John Wayne decor or the 70's flash back of nostalgia.Its not the familiar faces or the retro uniforms.  Its not about the beautifully designedBarn looking exterior either or the paintings on the outer walls in the back parking area.  Its not even about their amazing customer service that I've received with each visit.  Sometimes I think it could be about walking in and watching the vibrant colored oranges being turned into freshly squeezed sweet orange juice...But in my reality.... its not that either...For me its about their Western Omelette, a simple dish that includes Sliced Tomatoes, Shredded Cheddar Cheese & the ingredient that steals the show for me:  Green Chile, Hot & Spicy in all its naked flavorful glory.  I'm sure you've seen the many pictures I've posted over the years of this delightful & alluring little piece of heaven.  It's ooooohhhhhh so fluffy design is very well indeed, with its soft velvety and very luscious spicy taste  but what does it for me is the Green Chile!  Not only the chopped flavorful green chile that is added in over-abundance on the inside but it's also the green chile sauce I add on my own.  Drizzling its hotness over the top, covering up the sliced or sometimes requested chopped tomatoes, pouring over either side.  I love the green chile that is served up in the Big Pots near the utensils and other condiments.   You know the ones:  In those very familiar warming vessels, that sit right behind the fancy*wancy coke machine, with all their yummy goodness inside!  The heat from the boiling green chile gives my Western Omelette a kick that it wouldn't otherwise have and along with that it melts the cheese that is hidden on the inside with the chopped green chile.  If you haven't tried Frontier lately.... you should give them a go around! Anything you order you should include a side of chopped green chile as well as the hot steamy green chile in the warming pots!  It'll definitely add a kick to any dish they serve!"}, {"review_id": "o7olGng8WJPC3prmFgAUsw", "user_id": "MzChGR7Ohnzu3z7OZab-4g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "This place was recommended to me so I gave it a shot.

The chips were nice and salty just the way I like them. The guacamole had lots of flavor and was great. I also ordered a cinnamon roll. Pretty sure it wasn't on the menu, but one of the other yelp reviews told me to get it. It was amazing! Not too sweet. Not too cinnamony but lots of butter.

I have never been disappointed. Never until my last visit earlier this month.Their service and food has always been good, if not great. My family makes it a breakfast \"destination\" when those of us who live out of town come to visit.  Not a morsel gets left on a plate. If the green chile breakfast burrito, or bacon & eggs & hotcakes, doesn't get completely consumed, it is taken home. Which frequently happens because we always get one or two large cinnamon rolls to share . . . oh, a few extra yummy tortillas!  Our desire is always larger than our stomachs!So, this latest visit the disappointment came when I looked at the receipt when I got home. I wondered why breakfast for two seemed to be so much more expensive than usual. [The cashiers who take our orders are so efficient and we are so busy looking at the extensive menus about our heads that we never see each item we order as it is rung up.] The only slow down this last time was when she asked if we wanted a sample of the OJ because it was \"out of season\" and not up to their usual standards. We tasted it and it was different - a little watery, but still ok - so we ordered it too. We always order OJ at Frontier because it is usually very good. [Part of our family conversation at the table when we all got our meals was: What does \"out of season\" mean anymore? Back to the \"receipt\" disappointment. A watered down OJ (large) was $8.25; a small coffee-mug of watered down OJ was $3.75. [Even with a little bubbly added in, it shouldn't have cost that much.]  I am so very disappointed in one of my favorite ABQ restaurants. \"Out of Season\" for now. Go eat, but don't order OJ until they stop giving samples and tell you that the OJ is \"in season.\""}, {"review_id": "4wMpojmtvxa2sPbWk42YZg", "user_id": "EGgsIVJm0ew2qJiJfz__TQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Love love love the breakfast burritos here!!!

Decent food, giant location.The breakfast burritos are spendier here than at Golden Pride. Sweet rolls & western hash browns are solid. The Mexican Combo with a taco, enchilada, rice, beans & a tortilla is a filling lunch, but a bit much at $8.50.The clientele is what keeps me from frequenting Frontier more often. I was having a solo lunch there recently and was harassed by a group asking for my leftovers (I had just sat down with my tray!).
