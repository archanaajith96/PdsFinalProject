Consistent is not how I would describe my experiences at Prairie Street.When I first discovered this place I was blown away by the cheese curds and the hand breaded chicken sandwich. I came multiple times a week to get my fix; I brought all my friends.. and that's when I noticed a pattern.The cheese curds were either AMAZING or half raw and inedible. There was no in-between. The chicken sandwich was either INCREDIBLE or stringy, dry and burnt to a crisp. The service was either STELLAR or nearly non-existent.It doesn't matter how good the food is if I don't know what to expect when walking through the door. I do believe I've made my last trip to Prairie Street, as sad as that makes me."}, {"review_id": "sYKQX_iavkcm7RtYXgv5UQ", "user_id": "Oi1i27eAHdL8C-tXD5Qi5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Went here for lunch during a baseball tournament.

It's located on the river and people can dock there boats in the summer. It's got 2 different bars inside of it. The upstairs is the restaurant and the downstairs is known as the Tap Room which has slot machines, darts, pin ball, etc...It's also more of a sports bar theme compared to upstairs. They are always doing events, whether it's be a wedding on the Prarie Street side or having a movie night on a projector screen for all to see. This place is a great place to be. Did I mention it's a brewhouse!?!? They make there own beer and my favorite is there version of the Summer Shandy. They just recently added guest beers to there drink list.Overall, food, beverage, and atmosphere is good but the service is mediocre at best. I would eat up stairs and just get my drink from the bar."}, {"review_id": "e0DLFIV4UZDeUqHihMsDXg", "user_id": "4Cv9G8xd8nmfqrnwPDubjQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "We stopped by while in town for an event - we actually found the place just by looking on Yelp and had no idea what to expect.  The space is gorgeous.  We got a flight and thought the beers were pretty good.  They had a nice variety, in addition to some popular IPAs, so there's a little something for everyone.  As for the food, we were pleasantly surprised by how many vegan options there were, as well as the variety of food, some unique - this isn't just basic pizza and pretzel pub fare.  We tried the beer cheese potato soup (really good!), the blacked salmon burger, the black bean burger, onion rings and their unique beer chips.  We liked it all.  Most places have pretty dry black bean burgers and theirs was nice and moist.  Great choice for vegetarians!"}, {"review_id": "ikODgwYPnzTOybmy0i4SUA", "user_id": "NyAyV58L-KDecaX3UEhPnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "This place is truly a great place for a beer and a bite. I have been here a few times and each time, a decent experience. We went with some friends from out of town last weekend and they were impressed. I had the session IPA and we ordered wings, cheese curds, and Korean tacos to share. The ONLY reason I gave only four stars is because I thought the tacos could have been a little better. More pork, less kimchi. Otherwise, wings and curds were good."}, {"review_id": "LNyDtjO2Ec_lSrbovIYwZw", "user_id": "5g1-aaP5_Zr3YiUlZyaLhQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The attitude in here is unreal. I ordered a simple cheeseburger with fries medium rare and got a well done piece of shoe leather. Took two bites and said no way.. told the pregnant bartender who showed it to her supposed manager. He rolled his eyes. Yes, they took it off the bill but no apology, nothing . Just attitude from then on out. The bartender just wanted us to close the check. The beer is not good enough here to put up with the crap. We didn't go back here for a long time due to the same treatment, but obviously nothing has changed and we will never be back. We are not difficult people whatsoever. Yet when you pay $11 for a simple cheeseburger and it not right , admit it, take care of it and don't be an Ahole  about it..

My best friend and I were looking for a brewery and most of them were closed on Sundays. What a plus that RBC was open! My sister took us and it was such a cool spot! It was raining unfortunately so we didn't sit outside. We sat at the downstairs bar which was really cool. My friend and I shared 6 beer flights. She really enjoyed the lemon drop beer and ordered a glass. I liked all the slot machines and the arcade games which kept me occupied for some time. The pin ball machine was so fun! It's cool to see old school games being brought back like that. After leaving the bar, we went outside and saw the dock and water. We took many beautiful pictures and can't wait to come back when the weather is nicer!"}, {"review_id": "LgQhZfNe13-ZXl_O27GBeg", "user_id": "9c6KMba_Zyjc-b1migrLGw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/26/2016", "text": "Not a bad restaurant, by any means. From what I understand it is a fantastic place to visit for many different types of microbrew beers, but I usually go just for the food. My most recent visit netted me a brat covered in sauerkraut and it was honestly not as good as I expected from a restaurant that could literally boil locally made brats in their own beer. However, the brat tasted relatively bland, especially compared to some of the beer brats I've made in my own house. That being said, the rest of the experience was pretty good. The service was prompt and helpful, the chairs, table, and napkins all felt quality and coherent, and the interior of the restaurant and the building it resides in is really quite stunning. Next time I think I'll try a different dish!"}, {"review_id": "Niea2Q7x8WONmQfKOl4uVg", "user_id": "DwyevLE3RWfuBzgcJtRFyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/7/2017", "text": "Just had lunch outside at the dockside Tavern.

The dock on the river is great for warm weather, but stay away from it on nights that music is being performed if you're looking to relax after a bike ride. For whatever reason, it's a location that brings out the most annoying local downtown socialites who, quite frankly, should shut the f**k up when bands and artists are performing or go somewhere else when you want to talk above the performers.

The atmosphere is pleasing, wood, metal and brick, with old photos on the walls and big, open wood windows. The best feature was our server, Grace. As it was our first visit, she was welcoming and made all the correct recommendations after asking what we liked. The food was great. I had the Prairie Street Burger; my husband, the Pulled Pork. We had a 10 ounce beer, perfect size for lunch. I took home a house made pretzel which was huge and delicious. Prices are reasonable.
