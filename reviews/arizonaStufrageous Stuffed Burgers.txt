To start with the restaurant is spotless, the decor is fun and inviting! The menu is very easy to navigate. I'll admit I was a little intimidated by all the choices being this is my first stuffed burger! The young lady with black framed glasses and her hair in a bun so so accommodating. She walked us trough the menu and explained the process and even made recommendations. The 5 star service came when I asked what the \"outrageous\" sauce was like and she excitedly offered me a sample with a few fries! It was delicious!! Spicy and sweat! Lots of menu items makes this place great for for everyone! The brioche bun was super soft and buttery and my burger was great! It was large so I could only finish half! The same lady checked up on ask a few times which was nice. Overall this is a 5 Star place! Looking forward to my next visit!"}, {"review_id": "IA7Sotj21Sw5iIv0i6UfYA", "user_id": "iojX3Zn6NRMSCKWgwwbgrw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "I ordered from this business with Postmates. The order was 40 min late, and upon investigation it was discovered that they forgot to put in the order. When the Postmates driver got there, she was made to wait for the whole order to be made. I was late to work because of their error. Do not ever order from this business with a delivery service. Furthermore, even if the order has gone seamlessly, I would never order food from here ever again, simply because it was disgusting. Greasy, flavorless, carelessly put together. It reeks of of poor quality. The flavors just aren't there and none of these qualities justify the price point. Simply gross, we did not even eat it."}, {"review_id": "EsHW_ucbrLcWvrpZvurhtA", "user_id": "oGQnKOBNrwERM-MLLfpyGA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Hamburgers being my very favorite, I am always in line for the next great Hamburger.

Hard fried and cold when we got  them, definitely NOT Tempura batterFrench Fries - Excellent, but far too much saltBurger - The \"Stuffing\" was too little to be of any consequence and I had Blue Cheese, so with a proper amount should have been a taste treat. The quality of the meat was excellent although very small burger and the Brioche Bun was very good.Service - excellentPrice - $35 for Burger and a side each (no drinks, just water) for three was way too much for the quality and size (lack of) of the burgerFreddy's doesn't have to worry."}, {"review_id": "VIMPC61x8KFVKGozaaixag", "user_id": "W4ZuWztx47aiksyYPUMYDw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "When I was ordering, the girl at the counter seemed like I was troubling her, especially anytime I had a question. She seemed either extremely bored, tired, or bothered by me. It was strange. The burger patty is stuffed with whatever you want, I chose mac n cheese, cream cheese and  sauteed onions, and then on the side are the usual toppings like tomatoes, onions, and lettuce which acts essentially as a side salad. I appreciate the creativity and idea of this place. Very unique. But they need to work on their service. Also, it is pretty pricey, for my one burger it was over $10."}, {"review_id": "PIuDwdPP_crAHLhAm6FuaQ", "user_id": "lR9w5tvWvkdkS2yEDtFY1A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great place and ambiance the outrageous fries were simply amazing !!!!!

Two thin beef patties molded around soft, gooy, cheesy, mac and cheese with jalapeños and bacon. To my surprise the burger did not fall apart at all. It was well packed and stuffed. It was very heavy,definitely filled me up. The fries were fresh and crispy. Since it was my first time, the girls behind the counter offered to sample their outrageous sauce. It was almost like a spice in-n-out sauce. I could understand why people would want to put it all over their burgers and fries, but I kept mine on the side this time to try to original taste. This could easily be a $10+ burger at a sit-down restaurant but they were able to make these fast and affordable. I love that Wednesdays you are able to get free fries! I'll have to come back again on my \"cheat day\".

Everything is freshly made and you can make some pretty crazy concoctions. I get the veggie burger and it is amazing! Going to a burger place can be iffy when you are a vegetarian, but this place is great for that. Their fries are also freshly made and extremely delicious. They have a special fry sauce that seems to be a big hit. Great drink choices and they have China mist iced tea. It's the best!The only downside is how long it takes to get your food. I think this comes from everything being freshly made so I can't complain about that. Highly recommend giving them a try!!"}, {"review_id": "lTZuLrr0NZvnCZ8UqNKQOw", "user_id": "LB_absvIC625L0i0HpT5Sw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Decided to come here on a whim cause we were close and it had good Yelp reviews... so glad we did!

OMG. I loved that the burgers sticked together and wasn't flimsy. I ordered the mac n cheese burger and my boyfriend had the jalapeño melt. Both burgers were delicious. However, I liked his jalapeño melt better because I'm a sucker for cream cheese. I liked the mac n cheese burger because there is mac n cheese inside the beef patty but the jalapeño melt felt like it was more meatier/beefier. I was really surprised how freakin' good this place was. The young ladies behind the counter were so nice and they welcomed us with fries and a sample of the outrageous sauce. The way I would compare the taste is similar to miso-mayo sauce from sushi restaurants. Grab a milkshake before you go. It's only $2.99. I got vanilla, with Reese's cups and Oreos. So creamy!I have to come back and try their outrageous fries!"}, {"review_id": "A52-ULopZHnNd2mZRbx8KA", "user_id": "C6111py7n6OZYEQi1-Gz7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "It's one of the best Burger I have ever eaten.

But I decided to try it anyways and I'mDefinitely glad that I did. My experience I could tell from the outside that they were pretty busy so that was a good sign. Well The moment I walked in I was greeted by one of their employees which is always a plus and a nice gesture. I looked around and it was quite busy but even for them being busy the place was pretty clean. The area was quite big which you can't really tell from the outside. While I waited in line I began to look over the menu because I had no idea what I wanted to get and since you can pretty much customize everything I wasn't really sure what I wanted. When I finally got up to the register I explained to Jenna(the employee) that it was my 1st time stopping in and i was totally lost she was super friendly about it and broke it down, she also told me what was their best sellers and directed me to their signature burgers. I ended up getting the Greek burger and the fact that I could have it lettuces wrapped made it even better I also Ordered their sweet potato fries and took my number oh and I noticed if you check in you can get a regular drink as long as your purchase comes out to more then $8. I took my number and took a seat. the aroma of food was all over the place and made me super hungry.. haha It took about 10 minuets or so for my Order to come out.Both the burgers and fries tasted amazing, the burger was a little messy looking but I have no actual complaints about either one. The Burger patty is pretty small but it's kinda expected due to the things you have to put in it.  I'll definitely be returning to try out some more things on their menu."}, {"review_id": "iSYfMa3rGdjLk7k45P9m8A", "user_id": "OEuoDD8PboD_wKTU2HYUhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "OMG!

These fries are completely legit! Crispy - almost like they have a light batter on them. Definitely give their outrageous sauce a try - spicy sweet!
