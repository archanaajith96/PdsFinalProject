Finally a place in this town that knows how to properly poach an egg. Easily one of the tastiest and best executed eggs Benedict's I've had. The ham was super smoky, the biscuit was fluffy and soaked up all the sauce, the potatoes were most likely fried in bacon fat. Everything was so flavorful. My husband had the chicken biscuit, and it was also fantastic. Much more unique, the best word we could use to describe it was fascinating. The chicken was crispy and flavorful, the gravy was simple but tasty, the chow chow on top and the sorghum drizzle balanced the dish perfectly.The ambience was eclectic, cozy and relaxing. It was the perfect start to celebrating our first anniversary and we'll absolutely be back!"}, {"review_id": "8TdQ5bsb1ZB-hDE0kFVJZg", "user_id": "VciBS8_Zd-QZ2dMBA4Ae1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Based on the other reviews for this place, I was expecting to like it, and I definitely was not disappointed! The food was unique, but just familiar enough to make it extremely difficult to decided what to order... my favorite kind of dilemma! The chicken biscuit was recommended to me by the waiter, and I'm very glad I went with it. The tamarind juice was delicious as well. They have daily specials as well that makes it all the more difficult to decide. They feature local artwork as well that's for sale which I loved looking at while we were there. I don't visit Knoxville often, but I would definitely return the next time I'm in town!"}, {"review_id": "UZFpnMNpcV6oxH8fNMRwIw", "user_id": "tVATdRmknnYn5FxsSuAcNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "I love this place so much. Arguably one of the best places for brunch in the city. The hours are limited, with the restaurant typically closing around 2PM, so seating can be sometimes tricky as they have a large morning crowd. The restaurant is so lovingly decorated and displays ever-changing local art. The dishes are miss-matched, and paper menus and string lights litter the table settings.They have incredible and fluffy lemon buttermilk pancakes, and a pretty great \"build-your-own\" or a la carte breakfast options. However, I will always and forever recommend the carnita tostada with verde salsa. Egg sunny side up. It's the perfect mixture of spicy, savory and crunch. Be sure to slide in a side order of pork belly bacon to boot. They also offer vegan options and meat substitutes as well! I tried the tempeh \"bacon\" on my last visit, and while I will not be ordering it again personally, I did respect it. Ha.The Horchata is amazing, and tastes like being bundled up in your favorite winter scarf. (Buyer beware, it usually sells out by mid morning) The tamarind is an easy replacement if you're feeling adventurous in the beverage department. If you've never sampled tamarind, it has an almost blended taste of fig and apple."}, {"review_id": "-ufhJUbtV0R9TFvcWu0vDg", "user_id": "TrU49Ydk2ZMjlh0rtOVj7g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "I liked Olibea, so don't let the 3 stars throw you off. Service was not up to par, but the food saved the day. When in Knoxville for a few days I had a free morning to take in brunch. I pulled out my handy yelp mobile app and this seemed like a good option and close in proximity to my hotel.The downtown location has its pros and cons. It is a charming area. On a weekday mid morning parking was not a huge issue, but I did need to park two blocks away. Metered parking is off street and the restaurant has no lot of their own. The walk in front of the business was clear of debris. I walked in with a friend to find a cool space vintage space. The building is probably early 1900. A big table was occupied by what appeared to be UT students that were finishing up. Other than that it was empty. A waitress seated us by a window which was a lovely spot. She got menus and drink orders. The female waitress was pleasant. Coffee and waters were out within a reasonable time and the crowd had departed. My latte was yum. I ordered the Tennessee Benedict with side of potatoes. My friend a bowl of oatmeal with side of bacon. The food hit the table around 20 minutes after the order was placed. That seemed long considering we were the only customers. Refills of water were conducted. My dish was pretty good, but I did not care for the hollandaise, just an off flavor to me. The potatoes were super with enough grease to provide flavor. My friend loved his oats with crisp bacon. My friend and I enjoyed conversation for 15-20 minutes after the meals were delivered and needed refills from the small water glasses. At this point our breakfast was eaten and no follow up took place to check on us. In my book that's a big no, no. When asked if we would like refills and how was or breakfast our meals were finished. We both said fine. However, at that point the opportunity to correct any issues was gone. That's a 1 star deduction. The bill was processed efficiently without incident. I would come back and I suspect the result would be better on service."}, {"review_id": "LN2jrEDcH7wxns9HT9NRiw", "user_id": "k_KUouz0T_baBSxXwzrPoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "This is one of those spots that you wish was right next door to your home. It is so intimate. The decor is eclectic and the and the staff makes you feel right at home. And the food????? OMG it is next level good. I tried the Tostado and EVERY bite was delicious! I also had the squared potatoes and I could not get enough. My meal was topped of with freshly squeezed orange juice. The prices are reasonable. You and your party can enjoy a filling meal without having to break the bank. If you are in the Knoxville area you should definitely stop by and enjoy the homemade taste of OliBea!

The atmosphere is relaxed and cheery, with plenty of natural light in the restaurant space. The one drawback is there aren't many tables, but that can also be viewed as a positive as it means more attention to service. We had exceptional service and an awesome meal.

Loved the look of the restaurant and the employees were nice. I think I caught them on an off morning service wise though. The server forgot my drink which wasn't a huge deal. As soon as I asked for it again it was immediately given to me. The bigger issue was that I ordered over medium eggs on my tostada and got scrambled. The server suggested a runny egg because it's the best with the dish so now I'm wondering how much better it would've been. It was still good though. I didn't leave hungry.

I had a breakfast burrito and a side of squared potatoes.  Nothing really stood out as being special or any better than anywhere else.  I also felt the prices were a bit too high for the portion sizes.  Normally breakfast burritos are huge and filling, this one was on the tiny side and not really stuffed to the gills.

I love the food and the fact that they use locally grown and raised ingredients. Everything I have eaten here has been exceptional and worth every penny. The prices aren't bad and the portions are huge. My favorite thing about this establishment, besides how delicious the food is, is that they provide tremendous support for the community. I follow them on Instagram and Facebook and they are always involved in events and fundraisers for our local community.  The walls of the restaurant are adorned with pieces from local artists and are for sale. Again, the support they show for our community should be exampled.
