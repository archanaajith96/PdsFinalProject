Called up Yelp and we find Juany's. Boy are we glad we did!The restaurant was nicely decorated. Simple and clean. We were told that they were busy, and since we did not have a reservation, it would take some time to get our food. They were honest, upfront and friendly, so there was no problem that the food took a little longer than it might have taken. It didn't seem too long to me and they refilled our drinks with no problem. Excellent way to deal with the situation!We picked two versions of their \"benedicts\" - a short rib benedict and a Latin benedict (avocado and bacon). Both were excellent! Served hot and fresh and heavenly.I'm not in that area often, but Juany's would be a reason to be!"}, {"review_id": "7DJnRMtvu_34x3J-dpi6Hg", "user_id": "n0oAW6bE6ZIR9vFyJhq56Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Pretty rockin' neighborhood place in Fair Lawn!I am out of town and came in with about 12 colleagues on a Tuesday lunch hour. We had just served at a nearby food bank/items center so were very hungry.We were seated by ourselves in the adjoining room which was empty and though waitress came and warned us that they make everything from scratch and thus take time, it literally took close to 30 min to get all our food. Their menu is quite interesting with so many choices so we also took time deciding. I had their iced coffee and many ordered their today's drink, which was like a mint lemonade of sorts. Iced coffee was so good~ sweet & robust and it came in this mason jar lookin' glass which was the envy of everyone. I ordered their lunch steak chimichanga (they also have breakfast chimis) and it did not disappoint. Nice, fat chimi filled with steak and juicy ingredients! I did notice that they didn't give me any tomatos that I had seen in other reviewers' photos, so when asked for some sort of \"relish\" like that, the waitress hooked me up with a small cup of pico de gallo. Perfecto! My friends ordered off of their Taco Tuesday menus, breakfast chimis, and literally everyone was licking their plates clean. I mean, we were hungry, yes, but the food was bangin'. Service definitely could've been faster though - I think we kind of overwhelmed them in numbers. (main room had like 6 people eating, we doubled them) But our waitress didn't get our foods wrong, accommodated to-go requests promptly, and fixed one slight beverage mistake off the bill quickly, all with a big smile.I got many kudos from the team for bringing them here and got to increase my Yelp fiefdom cred. Lol. Definitely would stop by again, but next time, better order quick appetizer first so we're not hungry for long!"}, {"review_id": "_1_Xo63JaQ8Bl5Fkwkc0nw", "user_id": "URMCMZj2xfy1Tg4VMCoWBQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "If you are here on a Sat or Sun, you should definitely be ordering from the specials menu. Everything is made fresh for the day so items tend to be sold out by the end of the afternoon. They are only open for breakfast and lunch.Service is always friendly and prompt. The owner is very hands on and she is always so excited to talk you through the menu. Byob and they provide an ice bucket, glasses and a carafe of OJ for a small fee. Coffee and fruit are included with all their specials and coffee and water refills are always readily available.I agree with reviews that the portions of some dishes especially the Benedicts are pretty small. Some home fries on the side would definitely be appreciated.Small lot available on the side and street parking. Definitely make a reservation for the weekend since they tend to get busy."}, {"review_id": "S1GS4_Iux6F0hgNV6b12pQ", "user_id": "vwO493zSzzY4xClSbeJUvw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "You can certainly tell they use fresh ingredients!! Cute spot to dine w/ plentiful sunshine. They had some space on the side where there was a bridal shower going on when we visited. The staff was very friendly. My meal was good but I was still hungry after!! I had the Chilaquiles Verde and my boyfriend had the Huevos Rancheros -- we both found the portion size rather small and  a little lacking in flavor.  We usually look forward to the fresh salsa w/ our eggs in breakfast Mexican dishes but we didn't really find that in these dishes.

This is one great find! Owners & staff are accommodating, friendly & upbeat, the whole vibe is inviting. Best breakfast or brunch spot. The food is freshly prepared \"clean\" food. Even their fried sweet potatoes aren't greasy, but outside crispy with soft & sweet insides. Egg dishes are simply delicious, served with fresh fruit on the side. Black beans are yummy with a spicy kick. I can't wait to go back & try other dishes on their menu or board specials!Burritos, Salads, Burgers all sound great.Lots of vegetarian options along with vegan options too, so something for everyone!If you want a wonderful local breakfast or brunch this is the place to meet or bring friends & family.Clean uplifting, pleasing light-filled interior. There is parking on the street or in a lot to the side of the building."}, {"review_id": "Fd7Bj5Wmwrgfxv7N_6K82g", "user_id": "aiFy0Aw0sJMzKoHtQiZTnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "First and foremost, not to sound bias but Juany's was probably the best Mexican restaurant I've dined at thus far. It's not your ordinary cheesy decor and tasteless establishment but rather a modern restaurant with flavorful menu options. The staff are so friendly and the service was great! So now time for the food, tonight I ordered their chicken chimichanga (super tasty) and oh my it was delicious. It's a large burrito topped with fresh avocados, drizzled with Mexican cheese, and salsa verde. Typically when I order burritos, it usually is stuffed with rice and very little meat; fortunately, Juany's mastered the rice to chicken ratio perfectly! If you're looking for authentic Mexican food check them out and they also offer Latin cuisines as well/"}, {"review_id": "v-aS71JRYL4GXDbgtilrBw", "user_id": "inCabX77SQWYxTSNQTncHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "Juany's Cafe is pretty unique in that is mixes Latin American brunch with some semblance of Mediterranean flavors. One example of such a thing is the Shakshuka with a mixture of both Latino and Middle Eastern flavors. Overall, it seemed that the food was pretty healthy and light, despite what you would usually think of a Latin American brunch. I say that because I didn't think it was overly greasy or ridiculously filling at all. It was just the right amount to satisfy your hunger but not make you regret it afterwards.This is a very low-key yet delicious place to go for breakfast or lunch. It wasn't crowded at all on the day after Christmas (which was a Tuesday) but I would imagine that it gets pretty crowded on weekends. I had the Heuvos Rancheros which had two eggs over easy served in tortillas with some salsa verde and beans on the side. Highly recommend it!"}, {"review_id": "yIyGbfdkVsR5lXMr73-O-A", "user_id": "uznWLX8OPqwlawabtLQtYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "A refreshingly unique brunch spot. I LOVE  my brunches and this restaurant pleasantly surprised me with their unique Latin inspired delicious dishes. The Wait: We called ahead and waited about 30-40 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. There isn't a lot of room to wait around in the restaurant so I'd recommend calling ahead. The Vibe: Quaint and cozy.  Casual and cute.The Food: Pictures speak for itself but Incase I haven't said it - the food looked delicious and tasted better!Special Notes: Our food took a little longer to arrive but the staff mentioned that they like to make everything fresh. We didn't mind since the staff was so friendly and the food was delicious!They don't have espresso drinks.

We finally made it over there for brunch on a Sunday. Juany's is easy to find as it sits on the main strip and even has a small parking lot of its own. Juany's brings a cozy, Mexican-Latin American restaurant with maybe 15 tables, to the much needed downtown Fair Lawn. The staff at Juany's was very delightful and welcoming . During our brunch the staff was very attentive filling our coffee cups before they were empty , bringing our food in a timely manner and making sure everything was as expected .So now the food . Let's just say I can't wait to go back. Although my first choice, the lamb eggs Benedict special was sold out , I was beyond happy with my second choice ; the breakfast burrito special. This delicious tortilla was filled with such things as slow cooked pork, potatoes , black beans , topped with avocado and a sunny side up egg, sitting over a home made verde sauce . Are you salivating yet?!?!? My wife had the chorizo breakfast tacos which were light , flavorful , and beyond satisfying. ( I snuck a couple bites  )Enjoy my photos as I check my calendar for the next free weekend I can go back!"}, {"review_id": "rVuwYMhOxp8g9qHFwdY6cw", "user_id": "N9tgUEYnMvdZSDDAZ46sJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Very nice cafe; lovely service; good lunch; clean bathrooms; I want to try their breakfast next time; Parking is an issue in Hawthrone so you may have to drive around to find a place.Tasty homemade potato chips!"}, {"review_id": "AhRmzyVsLEA7xLchgyI6yg", "user_id": "PjjNh7_fxuie8n26_hqxiw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "I have to say that I am SO completely disappointed with my experience at Juany's Cafe & Grill. I'm hoping it was a seriously off day.My bf was craving Eggs Benedict so I'd done a Yelp search for Best Eggs Benedict in Bergen County. I gave him the option between Juany's and another place. I was SUPER excited to try Juany's because of the 5 star rating and over 120 reviews. I think that's prrrettyyy rare.When we arrived we were seated at the table in front of the breakfast counter. There is a side room that is prettier, but when we asked to sit in there our waitress said, \"no.\" It was empty with the exception of one or two tables, so I'm not sure why. Especially because there was a HUGE mess on and around the table next to us from previous customers. Really awful that people would do that; looked like something exploded.They started us on our BYO proessco, and asked about coffee. My bf ordered one.Our waitress recommended the specials menu because it only comes around on the weekends, mostly Sundays. She mentioned that they were out of Steak & Eggs, and Whole Wheat English Muffins (no problem - our fault for coming late on a Sunday). I noticed that the specials came with fruit and coffee or tea. I ordered the Latin Eggs Benedict and apologized to the waitress for being a pain in the butt and asking for the coffee late...when she had already brought a cup over. She made a joke. It was all good. They ended up having one English Muffin left, which they gave to me. They gave my bf whole wheat toast, which he knew in advance and was fine with. We did not receive our fruit. I didn't receive my coffee. I asked if they had hash browns or something, and they didn't - only fries. My eggs benedict, I have to say, was delicious! But, I felt that it was way too expensive for what it was, no hash browns or breakfast potatoes? 1 piece of asparagus? Was it a decoration? Our waitress didn't check on us.I probably won't be back. We definitely had less than a 5 star experience, and left hungry."}, {"review_id": "7yhEDgPAxKUGPiMnFzo3BA", "user_id": "GX4WT5oxhA0SjVVHGyGf5g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "I really wanted to come here and give this place a 6 star review.

I love chorizo and literally think you can put it on shit and it would be great. This was not the case. The food was very salty, and this is pretty typical for restaurants, but usually when you add salt, you add flavor.. again, not the case.I do have to say that the coffee was great and I probably would come back for the coffee.. that and, I know I said this already, the staff too.

I'll be honest the name didn't really draw my attention, but living in the area we decided to drop by. This is the perfect place for the while family:folks looking for standard breakfast fare will find wraps, omelettes, and hands down the best pancakes around. People looking for something more savory, or breakfast with more flare can find egg dishes with slow roasted beef or short rib, black beans, guac and so much more. Breakfast burrito is my favorite: 2 veggies, a protein, cheese and eggs on a spinach wrap YUM fresh and plentiful. Surprising hit-The pancakes as I said are simply perfection. Surrounding diners are always chewy, thin and or overcooked. Even that country pancake house is terrible. My husband has tried the peruvian breakfast plate, breakfast tacos, and some others, never disappointed.
