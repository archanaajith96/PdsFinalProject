You and Marble Ring are tied for my favorite bar in Birmingham. Who knows...maybe our paths will meet again in the future. Quality drinks and even better service. What more can you ask for? This was OUR SPOT! The first time we came, I ordered one of their martinis. We went up to the roof top deck, sat back on one of their comfy chairs, and took in the Birmingham air....we finally toasted our glasses, I took a sip and instantly spit it out. That was when I found out martinis were NOT for me. The understanding and patient boyfriend came back downstairs with me and we ordered a new drink. Our bartender (female, African American, shoulder length cut, I really want to say her name was Raven? This was probably almost 2 years ago lol) asked if I liked the martini since she just made it and I was already getting another one. I told her the truth and she made me a sweeter cocktail (more my speed) at no charge and apologized that I didn't like the first drink. I couldn't believe how nice she was for a mistake I MADE. Ever since, I knew ole Carrie and I would be great friends. Never had a bad experience here. Service was exceptional each visit and the drinks (never ordered another martini) are always fantastic. The bartenders here will listen to you and make suggestions on what drinks you might like. Give it a try!"}, {"review_id": "RPlgvCkNTiIntkz3t7WhbQ", "user_id": "1QCoSbmHoGrSe2YcEApAoQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Cool spot and location. Good food and beer selection.

The rooftop is nice on a pretty day; it has probably 20 seats that include couches and comfy chairs. The food is okay, definitely nothing to write home about. The menu hasn't really changed since they opened and personally, I think there are much better places to eat. You have about 8 options from burgers to corn dogs to a couple of salads. The drinks are good but I think a little overpriced; this place was the first to truly make \"great cocktails\" in Birmingham (that come with a little show), although over the years, the experience and quality has gone down hill. The servers/bartenders are not the friendliest. Again, when they first opened they were awesome, talkative and engaging but now they act like they are just there to get your order asap, make your drink and get you on your way. Very little conversation or even interest for that matter and when I'm paying $10+ for a \"quality\" cocktail, I would appreciate a little smile or helpful attitude. All in all, its a cool place once or twice but there are better places in the 'ham."}, {"review_id": "ApOSBCfWegvHREzj2ORdpA", "user_id": "HYeM9vzo9uZrziDThBkmiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "This venue is always great for lunch!  The portions are good and you leave full!  The burger and corn dog are great go to's on the lunch menu.  In the evening the oxtail chili fires or fish and chips are nice!  This venue is also great for after work or on the weekend.  They have a nice patio space as well as a rooftop space.  An they have a nice cocktail menu along with a nice selection of local and regional brews.

After the show it's the after party. The atmosphere was amazing. The place is very nice and chill. I had heard hours before that you can't come here and here and not get the corndog so thats the first thing we did lol. The bartenders are geniuses. I couldn't decide what to get so the bartender asked me what I liked and said okay I'll be back and comes over with very visually appealing drink and calls it the Pain Killer.  Oh boy was it delicious. It's a great meeting spot for friends and I heard that their weekend crowd is seriously thick but I can't wait to come back here with my friends and family for drinks and to try more food. The corndog was delicious but the toppings is what made me sing. It was topped like Mexican street corn almost but up a couple notches. Omg. It was yummy. We killed it. Their fries were also delicious and cooked perfectly."}, {"review_id": "zRhtotTRr0Ihm3s-XlX2Og", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "What to get: beets and greensService: 5/5Atmosphere: trendy bar, gastropubWait: 0 mins (Wednesday 5:30PM for 1)Parking: designated parking lot across the streetThe Experience:Where all the young, trendy people come to drink. I was only able to enjoy a single beer, but the food is unconventional.First thing I love about this place: the parking lot. Yes, there's a lot across the street, which they have a cutely lit terrace in front of. The street isn't busy at all, so not to worry about getting run over. The entrance is past their patio area.Inside: trendy gastropub. How else can I describe it? I guess what they call 'hipster,' but that's every gastropub back where I'm from.You'll need to try the food here. It is a bit pricey, but it's different from the usual affair you find elsewhere nearby. Since I've been loading up on carbs and comfort food my whole trip, I went for the beets and greens to start. I also added seared ahi tuna. It comes on a metal tray, so the spread is beautiful with all those vibrant colors. A light meal which was balanced with a hearty IPA.I also tried the infamous corn dog. I didn't have enough room to eat the whole thing, but it was tasty. The sausage in the middle has some spice to it, while the outside is covered with hipster ranch and a BBQ-like ketchup. I'm very 'anti-condiments,' but I tried it. It's good, but very rich. The hipster ranch is more likened to a cheese sauce. However, I will say that the fries that came with the corn dog were bomb. I ended up eating more fries than corn dog, but at least you can box your food up so you can enjoy the rest later.Pro-tip: if you're not in a group, if you dine around the corner at the bar, it's relatively quieter than the main area. Plus people won't be crowding around you to order drinks and food. You'll enjoy your meal in somewhat peace."}, {"review_id": "MyKQYEZchmKJClrwfRWi-A", "user_id": "e4UDVgpJk-AeM7yHooKlxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Carrigans is just great.

We weren't too hungry, so we tried this famous corn dog Everyone at the yelpies boasted and bragged on.. let's just say, I was not disappointed at all!

First off, Carrigan's can be a little hard to find and second, parking can be difficult. However, there are two levels to this bar so there is plenty of room even on the most crowded nights. Some of the other bars in the area are very small, so this is a nice change. At Carrigan's they do serve food, but I have only been here for drinks. They are open for lunch and dinner. On New Year's Eve, there was a very young crowd and it was CRAZY crowded. On Thursday night, there were mixed ages but still a good amount of people.

My not so great experiences have been on Friday and Saturday nights. They get extremely crowded and it's standing room only. I had to elbow my way up to the bar and fight to grab the barkeep s attention to order drinks. It was also very loud to the point of being unpleasant. I also don't like having to shout to be heard.My better experience was on a Wednesday night. Surprisingly it was crowded but after a short wait at the bar we were able to grab a table. They had several nice beers on tap and a full bar with wine. Some of the members of our party got food. They have a reputation for a good corn dog. The ones we got were smothered in a unique sauce and cheese. They also had the type of fries I like browned and slightly greasy. It was a lot of fun and a conversation could be held without shouting and spitting on your mate and friends. If you like a crowded meat market it seems like Fri and Sat are the nights to go.If you want to enjoy the company of your mate and friends over a good drink and corn dog then pick Mon through Thurs night."}, {"review_id": "Pp2srbC3G6fqtMAfrizLrw", "user_id": "6_d_HhciAacx7Ntj1xIFsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/27/2017", "text": "I stopped here for a quick bite of lunch and was pleasantly impressed with the quality and quantity of food for the price!The noodles were perfectly cooked and the brisket was a fantastic contrast to the texture of the noodles.

You'll like the food here without a doubt, I can't say the same for your waistline though. The oxtail chili is flavorful and combined with the house cut fries, perfection. The bartenders here are all really nice and will take good care of you. You can tell they really enjoy their jobs. The interior decor is very industrial with a great atmosphere. They have a roof deck as well which is nice to sit out and enjoy the weather on a good day/night. Carrigan's balances the line between classy and casual to me and I love that about them.

I'm not sure, but whatever it is you need to try it.Nice ambiance, lots of happy hour specials and a rooftop that is available for mostly large parties if I remember right.The Mac and cheese with brisket actually has the brisket cooked within instead of placed on top like some places. Very generous portion. It's an entree not a side, but could easily be split between two if ordering other items. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.

Parking isn't terrible if you can get a spot in the lot across the street, and the inside and roof portion of the bar are very attractive. My one tiny qualm with this place is the price.

The drink specials are usually pretty great (Maker's old fashioned for $5 on Tuesdays!)But as with any place, for me, it's about the food. Everything is great, the lamb burger, the duck tacos, but it is all about that corn dog! I've never had anything like it. It is a homemade footlong corn dog covered in \"hipster ranch\", guajillo ketchup and cojita cheese. They lay that on top of a massive bed of Birmingham's best French fries.
