If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, come here. I can't say it enough! They blew my mind with the flavors. It is attached to a Mexican grocery store. We had to walk through the grocery store to get to the restaurant so at first I almost changed my mind. (Country girl not use to that! Lol) So happy I didn't!! I had 5 tacos with an assortment of meats such as chorizo, marinated pork, chicken, barbacoa, etc. Either they do not serve alcoholic beverages or it was Sunday before noon. The service was ...ok.

Without a doubt, this place hit the jackpot!!!I ordered enchiladas con pollo (chicken). The plate foundation was soft tortilla shells, layered with tomatoes, lettuce, onion, sauce, cilantro, avocado, sour cream, and other ingredients. The chicken looked more like thin pork chops...placed on the side of the plate. It was delicious!!! The chips were warm and salsa was fresh - spot on!Walking in was a bit of a maze, because it's located in a strip mall and you actually enter through the grocery store...the restaurant is a combo, located to the side. Best of all...they accept AMEX...more sky miles for my next adventure!!!

Service is minimal but the girl was friendly enough. I ordered the carnitas, which came on a large platter with rice, beans, veggies, avocado & tortillas for around $10 or $11. The beans had no taste and were sitting in a pot a little too long, the carnitas were good but nothing extraordinary. With the limited choices in Columbus I would give this place another try & probably just go for the tacos next time."}, {"review_id": "Hzfmzc0h1KBAZnLv36mm7g", "user_id": "RNstfXGgxLVzdo7A7vo7AQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "Oh my, oh my!  If you're looking for a yummy authentic mexican place, seriously look no further.  This place can be a little confusing as it's nestled in the back corner of a grocery store.  I came here for a quick dinner with my boyfriend and a couple of friends.  My boyfriend ordered the horchata and we definitely had no complaints there.  I ordered the barbacoa natural dinner plate and ate the ENTIRE thing!  The chips and salsa were fresh and had the perfect kick to it.  Our server wasn't the greatest - she'd ask for our order then would completely forget it and ask us to repeat it several times and she never really came to check up on us.  I had to go find her several times to ask for refills or silverware.  She looked really young so she may just have been new.  But the food definitely makes it worth it!"}, {"review_id": "CvO54njN2FSHckYUTfj5uw", "user_id": "wB5RuYYTAzIRJ35xaAOr3Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Really wish they had a better selection in the store. I'm from New Mexico where you can get a large selection of Mexican foods. Fresh tortillas are common including flour & corn. They do make their own corn ones but you have to ask.  Limited flour tortilla options but do carry Guerrero brand but not the \"cook at home\"  type which are the best. Bought regular ones but just not the same.  They could brighten up the store also. All the windows are covered I guess due to location( Victory Street) but lighting is horrible. Decor & flooring I'm sad need of updating. Looks like many grocery stores south of the border.  I think more people would shop there if it was a little more appealing."}, {"review_id": "fGDhmQyNFF0iMC3g6hKTjA", "user_id": "11O2Jq2WY5_CpRIJt0I_bw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "My favorite restaurants are always the ones that are \"holes in the wall\" or off the beaten path. This definitely fits that mold! This restaurant is actually located in the back of a Mexican grocery store, and if I hadn't been told about it - I don't think I ever would have known it was there! Upon sitting down we were immediately greeted and our drink order was taken. After ordering a diet coke I realized that the coke was actually from Mexico (I would have gotten that instead - I swear it tastes better than U.S. Coke) and Horchata (this will be my choice next time I visit). We ordered the chips and salsa which were good - the salsa had a little bit of a kick. I ordered a chorizo and carne asada taco, and a pork tostada. The tacos were on soft corn tortillas, but were layered with two tortillas. I appreciated this because one tortilla would have fallen apart from the moisture of the meat. On the top of the tacos were raw white onions and cilantro. They were simple yet flavorful. The chicharron on the tostada was crispy and full of flavor. The tostada also had shredded lettuce, cheese, onions, avocado and jalapenos. We did get an order of the tostones and it was a large portion but they were delicious! The prices are extremely reasonable and the food is amazing. if you are ever in the Columbus/Ft. Benning area, and you like good Mexican food - please go!"}, {"review_id": "ZUZ7ZucJp2vxfoWbYpzBaQ", "user_id": "QaVYyPISMIMPBehBDE5trw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "This is your classic kitchen-at-the-back-of-a-Mexican-grocery-store restaurant. If you're a purist, you might have issues with some of the food, but it's good Mexican fast food. I love the asada/steak tacos. They chop up the seasoned steak into little cubes and then grill it so it's a bit crunchy. I love the flavors and textures. Soft corn tortillas, sweet sautéed onion, crunchy on the outside/tender on the inside steak, crisp raw onion, cilantro, and the sour lime juice cuts some of the fat, then you take a bite of the slightly bitter and sweet radish... It's like 250 cents per taco (which isn't the cheapest but they don't really skimp you on the meat) Two of them fill me up pretty good.... ...Except do I order just two?! HA!We have also tried the tamales. They are huge and I like the pork better than the chicken. They're like $1.49 and totally worth it. The burritos are hefty: lots of meat, cheese, Spanish rice, and beans. Oh and THEY HAVE HORCHATA.

I saw all of the great reviews for La Mexicana so I figured I would try it out. When we got there, there was still over an hour until they closed but we were looked at as if we were intruding. When my friend asked our waitress what time the restaurant closed our waitress just stared him down and never broke eye contact. I eventually had to answer his question after about 10 awkward seconds.      From that point on things seemed to have been moving more smoothly so I was not going to let that first impression turn me off to the place. Then I asked for extra chips and guacamole after the food had already arrived and this time I got the stare down treatment. The food did not taste that great but what I had a problem with was the fact that one of the slices of lime that my friend received had a little crushed cockroach attached to it. It was disgusting and we could not continue to eat from then on. We made the waitress aware and she simply took the slice of lime away and gave my friend new slices of lime. The restaurant never even offered to at least partially pay for the meal.      At the beginning of the meal our waitress asked us if we wanted our checks to be together or separate. We stated that we would like our checks to be separate. At the end of the meal we were handed one bill. We asked our waitress if she could split the $52 bill and she asked my friend, \"Can't you just pay for it?\" We then spent 10 minutes with the waitress and another worker trying to divide the bill. My friend had $0.11 charged to his card so they had to run his card again. This whole entire time the waitress was staring me down and giving me an awful look. This was the third time in my life that I did not leave a tip."}, {"review_id": "ld6D6cIeW2udOjKDoqdARA", "user_id": "XhDUo71kIvi5mTn3TM8kAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2016", "text": "I first went to this place 15 years ago so I have history!

After having lived in California for 2 years, La Mexicana holds the distinction of making the 2nd best Carne Asada Burrito I have ever had!Their White Cheese Sauce is also very good and the Chicharrones are the best I have had, I think.

At first I couldn't find the place because I didn't realize you had to walk through the grocery store to the back to get to the restaurant portion.

I wish they would light pan fry or toast the tortilla a bit but all In all still decent. The chips were fine but the guacamole ranchero didn't impress me. It lacked any heat/spice and while not bad, kind of tasted like it was pre made and pulled out of the fridge.The customer service was lacking, not that they were rude or anything but they were not attentive.
