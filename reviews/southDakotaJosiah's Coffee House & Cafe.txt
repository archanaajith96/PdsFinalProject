We are 65 and we're easily 20 years older than anyone else.....and frankly that's the way we like it. This is a happening place with a diverse menu and no one has bad meal ever. From great breakfast options, comfort food and sandwiches you can't go wrong.If you want to get a feel for the surprisingly vibrant downtown Sioux Falls community, and have a nice meal, stop here."}, {"review_id": "wvt7WfOitWZogP6OemRUag", "user_id": "yCJRSasPU2f3By-eP41uQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Impressive spot in downtown Sioux Falls. Looks small from the outside but plenty of room inside. They have a couple of large tables that work Greta for a big working lunch. Tons of natural light.

It seemed like a lovely, local small business to check out. I was excited. It was a little difficult to find, being on the ground floor of some sort of corporate building, but the interior was cute and cozy.  I ordered a vegetarian omelet with a regular, hot latte, and my husband ordered the breakfast pizza with a chai latte. We also got a strawberry pop tart and, of course, a caramel roll. Drinks came out quickly, which was nice; however, the barista got my drink order incorrect and gave me a soy latte. I am not sure what I said that sounded like soy. However, I needed caffeine and it was not a big enough deal for me to complain and wait for it to be remade. It tasted fine, just wasn't what I ordered. All of the food looked great. The vegetarian omelet was good, but the vegetables and cheese were unevenly distributed - veggies on one half of the omelet with all the cheese on the other half. My husband and I split our meals, so unfortunately, he pretty much got a mostly cheese omelet. The fresh fruit was minimal, 4 strawberry halves (so 2 strawberries?) and 3 or 4 blueberries. The housemade English muffin was also good, as was the breakfast pizza and the pop tart. Additionally, while I liked the caramel roll, I didn't find it to be anything special - it looked way better than it tasted. I feel bad for not loving this place as so many do, but overall, I found this a largely forgettable and expensive meal (just over $40). Really Sioux Falls? I pay this for equivalent meals in Seattle. That's not to say this wasn't a decent meal. It was. Just not one that was worth going out of my way for."}, {"review_id": "ITEM4paEtRvfssmoCLM84A", "user_id": "dTl-jk5OojEeKC-rSgTWrQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "This place was good...I would say it was the bang for the buck that kept them from being a 5 Star place for us. $18 for a cold press and egg and bacon English muffin was a bit high for what I received although it was very tasty. My fiancée ordered the protein power bowl but.... it was lacking protein and flavor. Again, for the price it was lacking. One great quality of this place was the coffee. $1.00 refills and we were able to get a refill to go. Add some almond butter to the oats and throw a tomato and a bit more avocado to the English muffin and the price would be more inline."}, {"review_id": "VxXYqfF5tJXcRyxl2hDAHQ", "user_id": "pr3X8ISRd-lAJ391y77K-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Best two pieces of pie I've ever had. I had the salted caramel apple and it was outstanding. The crust was flaky and delicious, while the apples were so fresh and caramel was not overly sweet. I tried a bite of the French Silk, which was amazing as well. The chocolate was not too rich, but just enough to make your mouth water. I also ordered a chai latte; much better than a syrupy Starbucks. This was the real-deal black tea and spices. The customer service was as good as the food.

I smelled it, I saw it, I heard it... I needed to taste it. As I walked up to the counter with my friend a few steps behind me, I knew placing the order would be no problem. I was nervous, but excited. The employee made me feel right at home by calling me by my childhood nickname, wetsy. It might have been a misunderstanding, but she will never know what that meant to me. It's always nice to take a trip down memory lane. You see, my 6 brothers used to call me wetsy due to my inability to make it to the Jon in time. My 4 sisters were more kind hearted and called me by my given name. Anyways, the display case in Josiah's was amazing. It was beautifully displayed with everything I could have wanted. It was nice because there was a space between the counter and the pastries where I could stick my fingers through. Surprisingly fresh, I went with the blueberry pop tart. As we got back into the car, I pulled out the pop tart in anticipation and excitement. As my teeth sunk into the warm, crispy shell and blueberry filling, I was taken on a journey of self realization. I had never tasted anything better in my life. It reminded me of the time I had a brownie at my first college party, but the spiritual journey this pop tart took me on is incomparable to anything a frat boy can give me. I highly recommend Josiah's coffee. And when you're there, ask for the Wetsy Special. I think I made an unforgettable impression. Thank you."}, {"review_id": "kYzFdFHecWn3lnmvZozoPg", "user_id": "y0Ni0ePp3eWKpv2Ccz5Ssg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "Stopped by while in town for a quick breakfast- hands down favorite meal in Sioux Falls.

A cute cafe with an extensive food menu, sparse pastry selection. We stopped in on a Tuesday since the Queen Bee was closed, not gonna lie but that was our first choice. This cafe came up when we searched yelp. Order the strawberry pop tart. It's a nice portion size, buttery and fresh. I ordered a cinnamon roll (it was still slightly warm and very fresh) and large coffee with no room for cream...they could have done better filling up the cup. Check out my photo.
