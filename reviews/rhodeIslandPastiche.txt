The carrot cake is one of the recommendations. Small nut pieces are added in the cake and the cake is not that sweet. They use jam(or a kind of sweet) to draw a carrot on the side of the plate.The strawberry one I had crispy and full of cream. It has a base with strawberry and strawberry jam. The only deficiency is that the size for one slice is too large. It is easy to get bored of the taste."}, {"review_id": "w9LS97zjwWUrXYpiOdJrdQ", "user_id": "IR0S-EMmcbHPNZmdi4T5ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "What can I say but A PLACE NOT TO BE MISSED.  Sometimes you have to wait to get in, even to get take-out, as it's a small quaint place, but most definitely worth the way.  Friendly service and great vibe once you're in.  My favorites here have always been the tiramisu and almond biscotti.  I decided to break my habits and try something new, so went for the simple vanilla cake, and was glad I did.  Delicious with the perfect and sweetest detail of purple flowers.  My friend had the chocolate mousse cake and loved it.  The plain coffee was also delicious.  Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "oVxZbH-Lg1W_MtIL6rJ3pQ", "user_id": "LkYXWBIupp915Tsft8xb2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Pastiche converted me into a fruit tart lover. Crust is flaky, custard is creamy, fruit is fresh. DELISH and presentation is beautiful. Yes it's on the pricey side ($50 for the large one), but so worth it. Eating in - I've only sat down to eat once (on a Saturday night, an hr before they close) and it was PACKED. We waited about 10 mins to get a table. Besides taking our order and bringing out the desserts, we didn't interact with our server much. Other desserts - Their coconut cake was moist, double chocolate and pecan pie were good too. Hot chocolate was not too sweet and complimented the desserts. If you decide to get a whole fruit tart (or any cake I guess), call them a couple days ahead to put in an order. Pastiche fruit tarts are always a treat, definitely recommend stopping by if you are in town!"}, {"review_id": "jBkypRhvSCZ4c-slgM_y5A", "user_id": "M6zg0rKg0Z1QPDCSOZhwdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Our last stop before we leave Providence.

As I understand, as a non-Providence outsider, Pastiche is the holy grail of dessert bars in the city. No offense, but if this was in New York City, nobody would give it a second look (maybe that is a bit offensive). My fiance is absolutely nuts over Pastiche's banana cream pie. Like, absolutely bonzos. She cries about its life-giving banana flavors and orgasm-inducing fluffy whipped cream. She reminds me every week or so that she received a whole pie as a birthday cake one year (I get it, chill, I'll get you one next time). So you can say that expectations were pretty high.We arrived pretty late into the evening on a Saturday after enjoying dinner. It was freezing cold outside and were told by the lady at the door (their bouncer???) that the wait would be potentially 5 minutes. I'm not blaming her, but we ended up shivering in the cold for about 20-25 minutes and, because of its limited space, were not allowed to wait inside. I'm sure she would have wanted to be more accommodating, but there wasn't much she could do - still, doesn't stop me from begrudgingly shooting her dirty looks every now and then, angry that I only wore a blazer instead of a winter jacket.Once we were seated, we quickly ordered our cakes and coffee. I ordered the raspberry almond cake slice and... uh, is this supposed to be delicious? The outer cream had a weird hard-yet-soft consistency that I had never tried on a cake before. The batter itself was dry and the raspberry filling barely made up for it. I took a piece of my fiance's banana cream pie and was generally unfazed. Yah, it tasted like pie. Not really sure what else to say there. Even without the terrible, cold wait, I don't think Pastiche was really up to par with what I'm used to. There are tons of modern dessert places out there that do a fantastic job combining flavor and aesthetics. Pastiche was not one of those places."}, {"review_id": "RTdVJZ3q7ZXIBF-NMgrr0Q", "user_id": "lz2BG6VnzP59R5LWEYg4Zw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "I only ordered to go, so I can't comment on the dine-in experience, but it was extremely packed when I came on Friday night which made it a bit hectic trying to figure out where the line was because so many people standing inside were waiting for a table.I got the rustic pear frangipane tart, which was amazing. As per the staff's instructions, I warmed it up in the microwave for about 30 seconds before eating it. The pear almond filling is the perfect balance of tart and sweet, and the custard sauce just takes it to another level. It's a pretty hefty tart so I was initially only going to eat half of it, but it was so good I ate it all in one sitting. Pastiche is definitely one of my must-go places in Providence and I can't wait until the next time I'm back."}, {"review_id": "Y__UVZSlCg31TwPlUtzB2g", "user_id": "ho22Qpj5YlGqQl5e5xZ5Yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Where else do you go on a cold Sunday afternoon for dessert?

They have a really small dine-in area that's so cute for after-dinner affairs. It's usually packed, so you've been warned! The flourless chocolate cake is decadent. So rich and dark. I can hardly get through a whole piece. (Lies, I can eat anything here). The banana cream pie is very good as well, heavy on the creamy filling and whipped cream. I always wish there was just a little bit more crust, but my colleagues think it's perfect. :)My personal favorite is their carrot cake - it's covered in nuts and has an awesome texture. I love that it's not too sweet and it just tastes so damn good!!

Who doesn't? The coffee is great, the desserts are amazing and the service is excellent. It's always crowded here on weekends as people go to get after dinner coffee and dessert but definitely worth waiting in line for. The to go line is usually short and goes quick. I've only dined in once and I don't think I'd do it again, the small space is a little too crowded for me. The fruit tart is a must when they have it. But honestly, every dessert I've had here has been amazing. I often get a latte or coffee here too and the drinks are great. It's a good place to go for some to go coffee and pastries or for a sit down meal. The customer service is always great, the inside of the place is very small so there is often a long line kind of squished together and the employees are great about managing it."}, {"review_id": "sZw4K6B0Ye_fRWE7bZqSZw", "user_id": "IUxiguadVLHBls_kUAxcyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Fruit tart is the most delicious thing in this bakery.
