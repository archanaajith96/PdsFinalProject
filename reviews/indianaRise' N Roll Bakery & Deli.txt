All I've ever heard was crack donuts when people talk about Rise'N Roll. Of course I went on the worst day ever... Fat Tuesday... but good news guys they have paczkis till the end of the month. Anyways I got the breakfast #3 a slice of toasted sausage loaf (bread with meat in it) with sausage gravy. I also snagged a few of these crack donuts to give them a try. The gravy looks and tastes homemade which is awesome and the bread was jam packed with meat.... definitely enough for a full breakfast. I've only taken a bit out of my cinnamon Bavarian filled donut, but oh man I'm glad I got some coffee. This place has lived up to the hype! I will be back."}, {"review_id": "ElHkBqnwzk0m5iA2H4zLGA", "user_id": "DDt67ulRHr3cCRD9MdgCEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "One does not leave ft Wayne without trying their \"crack\" donuts.

I can't believe I waited so long to try this place out. I live on the north side & this is located on the south side, so I don't often go out of my way to get a donut for breakfast, but that is definitely changing.I ordered a variety, just so I could try a bunch. (Disclaimer: I did not eat entire donuts for this test - ha!) I ordered a glazed (can't judge a donut place without the most basic), chocolate frosted (ummm because who wouldn't want chocolate on a donut), cinnamon caramel (Yelper recommendation) and caramel filled (employee's recommendation).The glazed was absolutely fantastic. Very moist (sorry to anyone who hates that word-ha!), flavorful, melt in your mouth, yummy goodness. If I had no self control, I could easily eat a dozen of these. The cinnamon caramel (also known as the \"crack\" donut) was a pleasant surprise as it turned out to be my favorite. I'm not a huge cinnamon sugar kind of person, but this was WOW! A fellow Yelper described this as an elephant ear & I would agree, only this isn't dried out or thin & crispy in some parts (which are the things I hate most about elephant ears). The chocolate frosted was good, but nothing to get too excited about. The caramel filled was just whatever to me, and I wouldn't order it again. In conclusion, I never thought I'd find a donut place that exceeded my expectations after I tried Voo Doo Donuts in Portland, OR, but I was wrong. Rise & Roll just shot to the top of my list. Oh, and they also offer you a free small coffee with any order, can't go wrong with that. Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "hiZ-0oAb-Or1GYKJ_TLNAA", "user_id": "AVsuhkDWdGtrCvee47Mcow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Little pricey for lunch, but good food.  Service was a little slow, but it was pretty busy."}, {"review_id": "t5ZAcADc9C0E4OddelvacA", "user_id": "Cn3pKcYrMX3rOp01eG3WJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/5/2016", "text": "My 1st experience at Rise and Roll was nothing short of magnificent.

They are definitely Top 5 things I would need with me if the world was ending...if that gives you an idea on my love and obsession with donuts.CRACK. Seriously their \"crack\" donuts are so addicting, hence the nickname. I can easily eat a couple and they are even better as the donut holes. Grab a small box of those and eat them in bed on a Sunday morning....trust me it is the best way to wake up. To me they are almost like an elephant ear. Cinnamon, sugar, caramel (what it tastes like to me). I have tried a few other flavors, which some can be a little more \"fancy\" than the other donut shops. I, myself am more of a classic donut fan. My go-to donut anywhere is usually a chocolate iced, bavarian creme filled. Rise N Rolls is pretty good, not the best but you won't see me turn down a donut.I recommend a dozen of the \"crack\" donuts for your next breakfast run."}, {"review_id": "wUTUkMVGk1HFOeqW51p5IQ", "user_id": "2T8cxl3Y_JhCE8o80BSp0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2015", "text": "This donut shop is what dreams are made of.  I am putting Rise 'n Roll on my list of my best \"discoveries\" of 2015.My first visit was yesterday and I was so blown away that I returned today.I usually go for filled donuts but when the super friendly employee found out it was my first visit she offered me a sample of their most popular donut, cinnamon caramel.  After one bite I immediately ordered half a dozen.  I also ordered a few of the newest donut that another friendly employee suggested, I think it was called raspberry chocolate truffle?The cinnamon caramel donuts are indescribably delicious.   Not overly sugary-sweet but just the right amount of cinnamon-y sweetness.  They are soft and absolutely melt in your mouth.  The raspberry chocolate truffle was completely filled with the most delicious fluffy, fruity raspberry cream.  I have been disappointed with filled donuts from other shops because they contain about a teaspoonful of cream in a giant donut.  Well....the donuts here are completely filled with loads of luscious cream.  And again, the cream is not overly sugary-sweet but creamy and fluffy with the taste of the raspberry very pronounced.All the employees were very sweet and friendly.  Helpful, too, making great suggestions and recommendations.I can promise that anytime I am anywhere near Ft.

Unfortunately my counterpart has yet to visit the magical land of Fort Wayne, IN, and I struggled to find the right words to describe what is truly TBD not just in Fort Wayne, not just in Indiana, and not even just in the US of A, but in the universe as mankind knows it in 2017.Here is the conclusion of my argument: the Rise'n Roll cinnamon caramel donut does not play by the rules. In my estimation there is indeed some illegal ingredient in this little ball of glory, some sort of narcotic as its nickname indicates. When I wonder why these little shops are not in every SmallTown America, I can only guess that their donuts are outlawed in the other 49 states. If you are looking for a great donut, this is not the place for you. This is not a great donut.
