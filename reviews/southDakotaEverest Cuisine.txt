The weather was too bad the day we arrived due to snow and decided to try our taste buds for Indian cuisine. Surprisingly they were open during slow blizzard and were welcomed by a very nice server. We went for ordering Dal Makhani, Chicken Korma, Onion Kulcha and Garlic Naan. The gravy for both of the dishes were very flavorful and wasn't just full of cream like other places. Both Kulcha and Naan were quite big and sufficient for one person. The ambience was quite moderate and nothing too flashy but the food beats down unlike no other. I would definitely recommend this place to all those who wants to try food complete with rich Indian flavors."}, {"review_id": "EGxWenpnBcGJE-nYzya66w", "user_id": "CgVhTIsRr9ihPq78Za5gQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I had the goat curry and it was the first time I had goat. It will not be the last and it was so flavorful. The staff were so nice and helpful with everything. Their chutneys were both very tasty. Do not sleep on the naan bread and we had the sampler. My favorite was the onion naan but one was so flavorful. The dessert is chose was Kheer and wow was it flavorful. They brought it for us all to try and the flavors were delightful."}, {"review_id": "hE5aL93mVxOyCHW67qT-7Q", "user_id": "ZiRtEETZcHLXsiGutgKQ9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "A very nice and calm place.

There is a sign on the door of Katmandhu suggesting patrons to check out their sister restaurant, Everest Cuisine. We went to Everest expecting lunch buffet, but the waiter told us they do not serve lunch buffet (although there are signs that they have lunch buffet and buffet price is also listed on the menu) - not quite sure why, and we were too hungry, so we did not really bother to ask. We ordered:- Tandoori Mix Grill ($19.99) which comes with chicken, chicken tikka, lamb and shrimp. This dish was delicious.  The meat was moist and tasty. There are some meat juices on the plate.- Shrimp Biryani (Shrimp Fried Rice). This is my next favorite dish after the tandoori mix grill. They were pretty generous with the shrimps. - Chicken Tikka Masala. The plate was pretty small and they charged $5 extra for a bowl of tikka masala sauce. I think it is too expensive.- Momo Chicken (Dumpling). These ones are just okay.- Garlic Naan ($3.5). Can't really taste the garlic. Overall, pretty good for restaurant in Rapid City. However, I have tasted much better Indian food at other places."}, {"review_id": "LOMWoTWLbooo3gWZiOVmRw", "user_id": "tMqxceO84JQDMp7zYOl2LQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "I went to South Dakota with semi-high expectations.

I've tried some of the top Indian restaurants across the states and even in London (which is known for being top notch). There is no question that Everest Cuisine is THE best. Honestly, 5 stars aren't enough. The flavor of the Masala was impeccable. The garlic naan bread cooked in a clay oven, pure perfection. I ordered the Shrimp Masala HOT. Usually, when I travel outside of TX folks don't understand spice. Everest Cuisine mastered it. There's no doubt, I'm going to go back to Dallas and wish Everest Cuisine was in driving distance. If you're a foodie, love quality and authentic dining, then you've got to make the stop. The atmosphere is small, quaint and simplistic, so don't be fooled by the appearance, or you will certainly be missing out. Don't forget to try the Taj Mahal Beer!"}, {"review_id": "sYl4pTPzPxMj17vfRofgPA", "user_id": "09EwBJAbMs_FTvsYD6H_9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "By far the best restaurant in Rapid City and the best Indian food I've had in any state! I have lived in Rapid for over a year now and have yet to find another restaurant that's beats Everest. The food is Always genuine, authentic, and delicious. I'm never disappointed when going to Everest Cuisine.  The staff is kind and generous. Their warm friendly hospitality makes me feel as if I'm eating in a friends home rather than a restaurant. They have a wide variety of delicious vegetarian options which one can appreciate. My usual is the tandoori chicken tikka, chicken korma with some side orders of goat cheese naan, but All the other dishes I've had here we're of exceptional taste and quality as well. You have the option of getting mild, medium, or hot for your dish. I love spicy food and medium is perfect for me. They also have a lunch buffet I have yet to try."}, {"review_id": "7tCvVk_703P_UAO8rxtOPg", "user_id": "kVUNeO0snClShycxYFSwUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Quaint and authentic!

The rice is cooked correctly, it may not seem that big of a deal but I have been to places that have messed this up.  I have never had a entrée that I have not completely enjoyed. As you can tell I am a huge fan of Everest Cuisine.  This restaurant really shows you not to judge a book by its cover, or a restaurant by it's building."}, {"review_id": "6geqkIEpNywRidrJO1x16w", "user_id": "mhwh5OCzBudztr-jzHs8Fg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "The lunch buffet was fantastic!

It was worth it! My girlfriend and I are from NYC/CA so we know our Indian and this place goes toe to toe with any of them. The lentil soup is legit - you can taste the chopping and herbs. I could've ordered two servings. I got the Lamb Kadai and she got the Saag Paneer. Both were rich and had the right mix of ingredients and sauce. We paired with naan and rice. The naan is thinner but wider than what we are used to but so good. We tried the Garlic-Basil, which is a new combination to us. The dishes were spicier than what we thought (mild and medium), so we needed a Mango Lassi to cool off and it did the trick. Two apps, two non-alcoholic drinks (also a Masala Chai, which was ok) and two entrees totaled about 55 bucks including tip. So worth it!"}, {"review_id": "Ia6b6DspEGt3HRpdrKv05Q", "user_id": "dFbg_8JZdHsNs6aazUh_Cw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/18/2017", "text": "Conclusion: yes, yes, yes. Must visit. The best Indian food I've had  in SD. Positives: sauces perfectly spiced for optimum flavor of each dish. Meats were tender and moist. Vegetable were cooked just right on the cusp of soft and a little crunch. Portions were spot on (3 entrees fed 4 of us ) and the pricing is just right. Negatives: The outside looks like a dive and could turn you off before you find the pearl inside the shell.

Always nice heads up!Ended up getting a few things like the goat cheese naan, mixed appetizer, lamb curry (medium heat) and the mixed grill. I just want to say that we go to Yak n Yeti here in Denver and this tops it! Owner happened to have worked there many years ago, small world. Delicious flavors...great portions of meat...and amazing service. Everyone seemed to have helped out there and you get the family vibe. So much food!

The host was friendly and guided us to our seats. My friend and I got a booth! Service was fast and the waiter came over 4 times to ask if we needed anything! Food was great, and even my friend who was visiting from Chicago stated, \"That was so good.\" We were starving and they did not turn us away, even though we arrived 45 minutes before closing time on a Friday night.

I drove to SD for Rushmore and stopped by for a dinner. The food is great. I ordered vegetable samosas, chicken tikka masala and roti. Having worked in an Indian restaurant for over a year myself, it was very reminiscent and the flavoring is on point. The only critique is that the samosa was a little bland and lacked some spice and mostly tasted like boiled mashed potatoes. The tamarind chutney can cure that though."}, {"review_id": "o0S9mhWSP_BAedM92qIkzw", "user_id": "ByVbrOwYwrVCo1lY1MvFyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2017", "text": "Good food. Good service.
