This time, I tried the #28 Silver Duck: sourdough, pesto mayo, roast beef, pastrami, horseradish, havarti cheese and sprouts. On the side, I had the homemade cole slaw and a cup of homemade tomato basil soupThe ingredients of everything were fresh and the taste to everything as crisp and full. While I probably won't order again soon, it's definitely one to try if it peaks your interest. Yet again, the hospitality and friendliness of staff is incredible. We all need to support great small businesses like this one."}, {"review_id": "vp7UqYWn3gcbuoHMaQ7NwA", "user_id": "ZBANwRJ-8d61x66iZq8qjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Best sandwiches in the entire treasure valley!

We tried the bronco bleu, #16 dip (can't remember the name), and another cold sandwich along with the tomato and chicken/veggie soup. They were all great. And the owner made the experience even better. What a character :) I will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "7fDtairc24saKc-FpS2CuA", "user_id": "e_9jRYH2xAGnw8PrjATjPA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "First time I've been. I think I'll give it a 2nd chance before I give it more stars. The Bacon on my sandwich was bomb, everything else was so so. The bread was amazing, the potato salad not so much. Since these are things that are subjective, I'll try another sandwich and give them another shot. The service was okay, atmosphere was quaint. We enjoyed the olympics being on the tv. Over all first impression, it's nothing special. What was good, was great. What wasn't good, was awful for me personally. I say give them a shot and make your own decision."}, {"review_id": "IZ5FHdxIwFVGX3QOuyf7zQ", "user_id": "nRsFEhMqOCYm0_2a7KirHQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/2/2017", "text": "I thought for sure this place would knock it out of the park for me but I left feeling very undecided.The sandwiches were well made and of good size, the only thing I wish was different about my particular sandwich is the roast beef wasn't med rare, nothing negative, just a personal preference.With your sandwich, you are offered potato salad, chips or coleslaw. Both my husband and I chose the potato salad. It was very different, at best. It was a dark brown colored potato salad and jam packed with herbs, I think I saw green onions and maybe tasted bacon in it. It maybe would have been OK had the potatoes been cooked, they were pretty raw..  Not your typical potato salad overall but undercooked potatoes was no fun.The sandwiches were well constructed and like I said, sizeable but in my opinion, pretty bland. Granted, I didn't get anything off the wall but nothing about my sandwich really stood out, very similar to a Firehouse Sub.. Firehouse might actually be better? My husband's was a little bit more tasty than mine. The service was part great, part weird. It was all young folks running the show and the girl there was very friendly, greeted us upon walk in, friendly delivery of food to the table. The young man that took our order acted as though he'd been awake approximately one minute before he took our order. I'd like to give this place another try, perhaps try a more involved sandwich and soup instead of the interestingly strange potato salad."}, {"review_id": "LWOkuMq4zI_innuw_fGyIA", "user_id": "ao-AH4CKrHlJLdrxYm9reg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "Holy smokes these are the best sandwiches Ive ever tasted.

I'd give it a 4 for freshness, options, and service. But a 2 for flavor. The meat itself was pretty standard. Between the three of us we got the triple chin, Reuben, and a build your own. Again, fresh but nothing crazy. Probably better than your average deli"}, {"review_id": "YTyAC-OE6YdrZfsEY3y_Pw", "user_id": "X0uHA4n4wAa_7CbLn7Onbg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "I been coming here since they opened and have honestly never had a bad sandwich. The soups are fresh and awesome! Today I had the bacon jalapeño potato soup. Didn't have that kick I like but still delicious, almost tasted like clam chowder with the bacon pieces having the same texture of clams. I got the fat BLT today and it was amazing! Tasted really fresh, the bacon was stacked and not a lot of grease on the bacon so really really something you gotta try. This place always makes me happy when you see an owner who remembers you and engages with their customers. Everyone is always nice and helpful. Make sure you come with an empty stomach because the sandwiches are pretty big. If you think these sandwiches are small, I can't keep up with ya, too much food lol. My wife's Trevor melt is like a beautiful piece of art, the pesto and all the meats dipped in au ju, my favorite sandwich there. Give this place a try and I guarantee you won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "NutJ_8sABTawKTDH5afSSg", "user_id": "T_-zmSVIB02_d9qFcuA-7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "One of the better pastrami sandwiches, but more importantly the most unique and flavorful potato salads you'll ever have."}, {"review_id": "wr4Kj7MmTqWBlIkir7Heqw", "user_id": "zNqBZRbR6kSZC1h5b_fNTQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "Visiting from out of state.

We were stuck taking care of business in Meridian and decided to grab a bite to eat while we were in town. We stumbled across Fat Guy's Fresh Deli because of favorable YELP reviews and we were pleasantly surprised. We have found a top notch Deli in Idaho! The pastrami sandwich had at least 1\" of meat on incredible bread from our favorite bakery, Zeppole's. I had the Cuban sandwich and being Cuban, I can say it surpasses any expectations. I will drive across town again and again to come back here. Oh and the owner was delightful, engaging, and passionate about making us feel welcomed and made sure we finished our meal with homemade lemon coconut and white chocolate chip cookies. I have never tasted a cookie so good."}, {"review_id": "u1kgK7-vLKsDmogwKHmDog", "user_id": "30oDlroshHTsn46MA0_IcA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "Service is great but so far the best sandwich I've tried is the Ruben.
