So glad I found this place, though. The al pastor comes straight off the spit and has that yummy, bright orange caramelization happening on the outer edges of the meat. I went with the alambre de al pastor for $7.00. Comes with 1/2 a pound of meat and six tacos -- such a great deal for what you get. I love the casual, food court vibe and the paletaria (yummy drinks and homemade popsicles) right across the dining area. I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "JyqIwQ7oBELwtk-HaJtUKA", "user_id": "bOl7m4puZIXTL5E-Z4ReBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "I decided to take a walk in the Latino mall because I was curious what was in there...well, best decision ever! I found this gem inside and I am so happy it's near my work place. It is amazing. Ordering here is pretty simple, their menu is on the wall and you order at the counter. They'll call your number, sometimes in Spanish, but if they know you don't speak Spanish then they'll be calling it out in English.The first I came here I went straight for tacos. What else would I go? Their carne asada is really good. The beef is tender and the tortilla is super good. Even though their carne asada is amazing nothing beats their al pastor. It was tender pork grilled on a stick thing and there a piece of pineapple they top it with...amazing! The second time I decided to switch it up and go for their mix huaraches. It's a huge masa base stuff with beans. It's topped with the meat of your choice (in my case it's carne asada and al pastor) and vegetables, sour cream and cheese. It is amazing. And huge! Eating half of it was super filling for me. Totally worth it. If you want the typical salsa topping, they do have a condiment bar. I do recommend the light green sauce, but be careful, there is a spicy kick to it. Totally worth coming here. Totally recommend"}, {"review_id": "XJwd6Tik_4Gw2c-mV0b0fw", "user_id": "P555hOXndkHWPKf3C5b7OA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Well...what to say but danggggggggg.  This is some legit joint.  Ordered a ton of food and all were great.  Them al pastor tacos were delicious and especially after they throw it back on the grill for a little more crisp.  Who would had thought that a slice of pineapple with the meat would be awesome.  Add some of that smooth green sauce with it.  The quesadilla for both carne and al pastor were tasty too.  That cheese is the real deal.  We also got the hauraches and it's a larger version of a taco, but the shell is double thick with some beans in between.  Different from what I'm used to, but sold too.  Also had the guac n chips which were a nice start.  The place is located in a mall.  So, don't be nervous!

Delicious flavorful food for not much money, no frills, no gimmicks, no BS. Just a bunch of people making the best Al Pastor I have ever eaten. As others have mentioned, the tortas (sandwiches) are HUGE! Take a friend or skip dinner, it's a lot of sandwich. I get the ALAMBRE PASTOR CON PIÑA Y QUESO, it's basically 6 of the best Al Pastor tacos you'll ever eat for the price of 5. Other things on the menu are super delicious too (lengua tacos!) and they have some good home made salsas to top everything off with, but the Al Pastor is the reason to go."}, {"review_id": "fCveq4i2WMhsO2-48GiQQQ", "user_id": "sDnDusNNHHnE-zzyzB8WTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/20/2017", "text": "Ahhhh tacos, such a guilty pleasure. The little grease, the tortillas, the meat & salsa. Just typing this makes me want to go in my car and drive to the Latino mall! The food is hand down delicious and worth every penny. If you get yourself a torta, it's a money saver since you can buy only one and that feeds two people. It's humongous! Now my all time favorite to eat here is the speciality of tacos al pastor. It's called pastor con queso y pina. They lay 4 tortillas, add the meat. Pineapple. It's called pastor con queso y pina. And CHEESE! who doesn't love cheese? Then they top it with two tortillas. Yummmm. Now sure you might get a heart attack, and if you're into more healthier options this is not the choice for you. But if you want hands down delicious unique tacos. I recommend it! Also I would recommend going across and getting yourself a drink from the juice place. Their horchata is to die for. #literally."}, {"review_id": "BaIYcSmZtTZv7jn0WiETFA", "user_id": "8O_sCXpwR4ldV8g3QzVYsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "The holy grail of tacos!  The Al Pastor was amazing as everyone said.

They are obviously known for their el pastor and it is very flavorful although a couple times I went it was a little drier than other times but on average they are great. I usually get a couple carne asada tacos and the el pastor tostada and it is filling and hits the spot for my Mexican food cravings. Get there a little before the lunch hour rush hits if you're trying to get in and out quick otherwise sometimes it gets pretty busy. There are tables (about 20 maybe) and I have seen them all filled. Good salsa bar too to dress up your meal with lime and cilantro.

This place is a treasure tucked away in the Latino Mall. My husband and I ventured out on a whim and did not regret our visit. We ordered the Alambre Clasico and the Pastor Huraches. This alone speaks to our naivety because either by themselves would've been enough food to feed us both. The Pastor Huraches was excellent with the most flavorful pastor meat we have ever had. However, we would not order it again because it was quite difficult to eat. It would've been better to get the pastor in taco form to enjoy the flavors melded together better.The Alambre Clasico was one of the best dishes we had ever tasted. The bits of sweet pineapple perfectly contrasted the saltiness of the various meats. It comes with 10 adorable little tortillas that makes it perfect for sharing.The price was right on point. You get a lot of food for what you pay. The service was a little slow for our liking. It was decently crowded but not too bad, but the wait for our food was long - worth it, but long!"}, {"review_id": "NxxS6IIY5yUxZWDQja94ew", "user_id": "eW3Ub22imvqKQBqDtwJqUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/27/2017", "text": "MUST EAT if you are anywhere near here.  Located in the \"Latino Mall\" you won't regret stopping in.  No habla?
