The first time I went, my co-worker found this place by looking at yelp. The food was amazing. The portions are just the right size so you don't feel stuffed and will not get hungry later on. The next 2 visits were just as good. I have yet to have a bad meal and will definitely be coming back every time I'm on travel to Ft. Benning for work."}, {"review_id": "AUn-CZEdbQEI0i1ElsCoBg", "user_id": "2Sp0QCuZS_jADqXBW0sdkg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "Great Caribbean food in a strip center location, near Ft Benning. In fact, the menu posted has a sign that says \"We close at xx, or until the last soldier is fed\".  The food is terrific, if you love Caribbean flavor. Jerk Chicken and Pork seem the most popular, but there are also ribs, curries and other things to sample. For the sides, don't miss the yams, as they are sublime. My son loved the Mac n cheese, but neither he nor I are big into collards, but it looked like a tasty option. Each meal is made from scratch, so it does take a long time, one of the drawbacks of getting good food. Service is very friendly and you will feel at home in no time. The dining room is minimalist, so feel free to call ahead and schedule takeout."}, {"review_id": "iRkoIKA2Ktoaqp9uO0fn8Q", "user_id": "eeLb-rvJ865vgNLvz_jDpg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Ate here several times.  Food is okay, neither tasty nor memorable.  Employees are friendly."}, {"review_id": "FJbyirF-7LvenP4gNdrx0g", "user_id": "fCtaas26nK63cuiORkI4og", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Great non-fast food place near post! I often get tired of the same old fast food fare I find near military installations but I assure you this is a diamond in the rough!  Their service was quick if not witty and the food was as close to home cooking as you are going to find this close to post. What I assumed was the establishment's owner warned me that her jerk chicken did not contain watered down spice like the competition and I agree that it had a deep and consistent burn to the last bite but not over the top spicy which is a flavorful feat. The mac and cheese and collard greens were also excellent additions but the chicken was definitely the star.  Price was pretty good for the amount of food and the location a bit sketchy feeling with wire over doors and windows but not a bad find in this fast food paradise."}, {"review_id": "IgGJ5cbUHwt_iyTWdyo9zQ", "user_id": "yGtpUnImfJFSuJGf3Exi3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "I had jerk chicken w/ mac and cheese, collards!
