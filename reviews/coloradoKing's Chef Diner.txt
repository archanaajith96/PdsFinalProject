My journey commenced at the kingdom of one King's Chef. The breakfast burrito was enjoyable as a Colorado sunrise. Green Chili sauce is 5 stars. The servants treat you as royalty and as a result they are royalty themselves.

The restaurants theme is adorable- everything is Merlin and Arthur themed. We were seated right away and the service was exceptional. The portion sizes are \"king-sized\" so I would recommend ordering a 1/2 or 1/4 sizes, unless you are intending to share. I ordered the full-sized \"Huevos de King Chef\" with bacon- it was DELICIOUS, but I was not prepared for how large it would be. The pricing is pretty great considering the amount of food they give you. As a self-proclaimed brunch-expert I would recommend this place to anyone as a top choice for the area.  Warning: This is a cash-only establishment so no credit cards or checks will be accepted."}, {"review_id": "7GGbaOFZg6NaGxlP9LliXA", "user_id": "39iq0KGR5vRglwx5cC8-rg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "This little place ROCKS!!!First off, service was fast, friendly and efficient.Second, the food.... their Bfast Burrito was ranked #1 in Colorado by Food Network Magazine.m.gazette.com/kings-chef…I had the 'mini' burrito with green chilli.... awwwe.... total foodie awwwe.Third, portions are tasty and pleantiful...  Fourth, green chilli sauce is amazing.  Words to the wise..1.

The portions are huge. I had the grumpy 1/2 order and I should have got the 1/4 order. It was a bed of hash browns, a crap ton of bacon, 2 over medium eggs. 1/2 gravy and the other 1/2 green chilli sauce.  The green chilli is fairly spicy but not over the top. The home made gravy was spot on and the eggs cooked just right. I sat at the bar and you can see the cooks in action. The entire staff seemed to be having a good time even though the place was slammed. The coffee was not fancy but a good quality though. If I was not gluten free I would have tried the burrito which looked huge and popular.   My only complaint really is that there was maybe too much  bacon and it kind of overpowers the other ingredients.

CASH ONLY. Food was great and the portions were massive! You can definitely share a dish or take half your meal home. Anything with the green chili sauce is amazing. I don't think you can go wrong with any food here. My only downside is...I really didn't need to hear the servers take their frustrations out on the dishes by throwing them into the bins and making such loud noises! A table in front of us actually left after waiting to be served because the dishes were being thrown so loudly that they didn't want to stay any longer. It's a busy place so don't fret if you have to wait a bit.

BIG HINT #1 - CASH ONLY.BIG HINT #2 - They sell their green chile - I bought a jar to take home. Trust me you'll do the same once you taste it!Efficient, friendly service. Food came out surprisingly fast, almost too fast, like borderline fast food fast. Their take on huevos rancheros was epic.I had the Merl Scramble which was just ok. LOTS of potatoes and pretty dry. Needed more peppers, onions and cheese ...and lets not be quite so stingy with the green chile!! Increase all of those, especially all through the potatoes and not just on top and the Merl is a beast. So why 3 stars?1. I only received one cup of coffee, no offer to refill.2. Speaking of coffee when I see half and half out in a bowl sitting on a table all day my mind goes fuzzy. This is not real cream folks I don't care what anyone says. Real dairy needs to be cold so it can't sit out all day unless it has artificial preservatives. You can taste the difference. The fake stuff tastes like wax on your tongue. I'm sure it's cheaper and more convenient but I really hate when restaurants do this. I appreciate the no GMO and other healthy ideas here but the fake cream is a total fail. My server kindly brought me milk but that's not the same. After breakfast we walked across the street to Story Coffee for a real cup of coffee with real cream.3. Sausage patties - if you lay a pencil down on a table next to the patty, the patty is thinner. Not joking. I'm sure this is so they cook faster but man they were dry and totally forgettable. Tasted like salty cardboard. 4. The Merl could have been done so much better. It was a let down."}, {"review_id": "ODpboOGfu3zWx_U_YVeHWQ", "user_id": "o-D5QNL4FkURKKaZLJdSEw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/3/2017", "text": "So after 30 years of listening to how great this place was, I finally went for lunch when the electricity went off at my house and I needed something to eat...I found it stunningly unremarkable.Firstly, come with cash or you pay $2.50 fee to King Chef to use their ATM machine.The wait staff was friendly, but were constantly counting the money in the drawers...it was weird, and they did not wash their hands between countings.One waitress was so busy carrying boxes out to her car, she seemed to not be of much help otherwise.My burger was different than McDonalds, but not remarkably better or worse.

They sat me down, next to a talker.The server was quick/efficient, and dispensed with most of the niceties, but rushed around and did it with a smile. Couldn't decide. I DID ask one question, though, and that's if the sausage was stuffed in a casing. They said that it was not in a casing, so based on that decision, decided to go for what seemed like their house specialty - I went with the Breakfast Burrino (Mini Half Size) at around $6.85. While glancing around at the others' plates, I had a gut feeling that this was gonna be GI-normous, and it WAS. They stuffed it with Eggs, Sausage, Hash Browns, and Shredded Cheese. I asked for 'no onions'; though I did ask for the Signature Colorado Green Chili - which I'm glad I did cuz it rounded out the burrito and gave it a well-balanced flavor profile."}, {"review_id": "9XXyRioxrKifN5c65f-S6A", "user_id": "Zn6LCpn46gj6Cs9BspntqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Every single visit here I have been impressed with the food and service.  If you go on a weekend, be prepared to wait, as they are always packed.  Don't be afraid of their counter, where they take very good care of you.Their green chili sauce is awesome, and my favorite dish is their breakfast burrito smothered in EXTRA green chili sauce.My 17 year old son had \"the Thing\", and couldn't finish it.  It seems that they are not kidding about their portion sizes.I will continue to make it here as often as I can."}, {"review_id": "_2xk3GO7-nRjVbiuE-sL0w", "user_id": "Lhc9dPg5wbkpS3IB98WS4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "best breakfast in c springs.
