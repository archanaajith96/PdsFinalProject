I figured I had and was going to update my review, but since I haven't, here's my review from today.When we arrived around 1:30 p.m. 5/6/18 there were maybe 7 or 8 tables. Our server and the other servers we saw were running around doing sidework, which is odd at that time of day. Usually it's done at night so you're ready to open and then again just before a server gets off shift. If that holds true, I'd guess in a place that opened at 10 a.m. on Sunday they were all getting off soon? Who knows, but our server was rushed because of this. I asked for iced tea and water while my husband asked for water. I got my tea, no water. She didn't write down our order, which really bothers me because I tend to be picky and I worry that I won't get my food as I ask for it. I asked for water, but did say no huge rush. 15 minutes later my husband asked if she could get my water.I asked for very crispy bacon on my BLTA. Bacon wasn't crispy, sandwich wasn't cut in half and this is a LARGE ciabatta roll sandwich. It's always cut in half - yes, I know that's the chef, but the crispy bacon could have been the server not passing it along or the chef.Not once did she stop to ask how our food was. My husband's empty water glass sat on the edge of the table while she rushed past our table numerous times. We tried to get her attention and couldn't. Soon my empty tea glass joined his. Someone else, maybe the shift leader?, came by and grabbed my husband's empty plate. He had to ask her for water as she was walking away. She brought the water and only then noticed my iced tea was empty. Then we waited and waited for our check.Just poor service today. We were extremely disappointed and had today been our first visit, we wouldn't return. Since we've usually had good service and food, we'll try again, but it won't be for a while. And honestly, I'm not a jerk. If they were swamped or something, I'd have lowered my expectations, but they weren't. I don't get it."}, {"review_id": "PDXFBE8S_X5od4SW035n-A", "user_id": "YX2jtr8f-wq_O-1wt-6kNA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Pretty good atmosphere for a pub/grille.

Very nice looking place. Where half the restaurant is the bar and the other half is the restaurant. It didn't take too long to get us seated, but we sat closer to the kitchen right under an air conditioning vent. It was a warm day, but the air conditioning vent was not fun to sit underneath. Our server, was very attentive. He did go through all the specials for The day. They do offer brunch, maybe I'll try that next time. The menu definitely was offering a wide variety of items. We tried the burger served with fries and also tried the fish and chips. The burger was cooked just right and I enjoyed that. But the fish and chips, I was not thoroughly impressed with the dish. It just didn't have that wow factor. Maybe the next time I visit, it'll be a better experience."}, {"review_id": "9Z51wi_9cD0mno5XZwN55A", "user_id": "RnlFX6s5tnEAqKP5G1gbqw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Service is always awesome when my husband and I dine here ... and usually anything we order is delicious this was my first time switching my side to the side salad and it really just looked blah on a plate with ritz crackers..."}, {"review_id": "rgC68QJSNhGxU55NBHYvAg", "user_id": "APx20b9etKLY0HDovgSrMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/22/2017", "text": "Fantastic Reuben. Surely you have had a Reuben before -- it is one of America's most popular deli sandwiches. Corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, Russian dressing on lightly toasted (or grilled) rye. My friend Deanell has been bugging me for months to try the Reuben at O'Hare's. I had my first taste of this creation while I was judging the entries at the 4th Annual Taste of rio Rancho. Crazy good (I gave it the highest marks possible). So soon after the contest, Deanell and I hightailed it to O'Hare's and we each had -- you guessed it -- Reubens. This is like no Reuben you have ever had. Not brisket, but round. Warmed on the flattop for less than 30 seconds, it remained wonderfully moist. Sliced thin. Delicious light rye. This is a three-napkins juicy sandwich. The real surprise was the dressing. It is a mayo-based remoulade with horseradish, cayenne, lemon, honey, and finely chopped capers. Nice kick. Get an extra tub and slather it on the beef. This is what places this Reuben in a class by itself. And dip your rings in it, too. Side salad was very good, but the onion rings, while well prepared, were slightly better than ordinary. This sandwich is amazing . Among the best in town. Deanell was right. Very good fish and chips. Excellent corned beef and cabbage served on the 17th of every month (St. Patrick's day is celebrated twelve times a year."}, {"review_id": "UCZBeh6syYr4-uKXGMGorg", "user_id": "OOrgL1wmq1mFPXsbuUvSog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "Our family loves to keep it local!

We were out here on vacation and ended up coming back twice. I must say there are Ruben was to die for coming from an Irish girl I would never think to order a Reuben in New Mexico but it was honestly the best I've ever had! Their calamari was off the charts! This place is definitely a gem in the middle of the desert I highly recommend anybody to come here if in the area. I know an Irish Pub is not a familiar site in New Mexico but it's damn sure the best one I've ever been to. Oh!!! I almost forgot about the drinks Tosh was our bartender and did an amazing job I had a liquid marijuana cocktail and it was UNBELIEVABLE!!! not to mention the variety of beer is plenty. I will be returning for sure!!

The wings were done just right, not too salty, lightly battered and fried perfectly, deliciously balanced, with a mild nose and subtle finish...not too oaky or buttery, just right.  :). Ok - they wee just some pretty solid wings. My Caesar salad for dinner was also very good.  The shrimp were grilled perfectly.  Most places over grill them so they're nice and chewy.  O'hares grilled them just right.  I also had a side of mash potatoes with their green chili gravy. Snap!  That's a must try - trust me.  The service - wow!  It was excellent. We had a young dude who couldn't have been more polite and attentive...seriously, this guy was top shelf the whole way.   I also need to add that the manager (we believe) came by and asked us, not just how everything was but more specifically \"how was everything tonight...did everything taste good and was the the service good\"?  Seriously?  This is 2015...who the hell asks that anymore?  Lol.  Again, I was very impressed.   Nothing makes for a better dinner when you go from zero expectations to being blow out of the water by good, solid tasting food and great service...very cool indeed!  I hear/have read that the prime rib is also something not to miss.  I'll be back - most definitely.  There's a Ruben with my name all over it - and slow pork roast that i saw hit another table that look sick-good. Well done O'hares...See you soon."}, {"review_id": "zL_vCwxZD0exfr3ZWA0VSg", "user_id": "GAWfWK0UwjsVfnZyc6ul9w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/26/2017", "text": "Heard good things about this place.

We discovered this place a while back via a good friend who raved about the food - in particular the Sunday Prime Rib special. We first visited on a Sunday, had the prime rib special and it definitely lived up to the hype. The prime rib was very tasty, a good sized serving for the price along with a couple of great sides. Since then we've visited often, mostly for the Prime Rib dinner but my other favorite is the Philly French Dip - so good! O'hares a great little bar-slash-diner with yummy food and good service.
