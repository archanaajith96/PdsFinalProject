I recently spent a few days out of town and this was a recommended stop by a friend of a friend.Mama's Phried and Phillys is literally a hole in the wall. The walk-up window is just for presentation as far as I could tell, but maybe it's utilized when the weather is nice. The seating inside is a counter top and about ten stools or so. There were a couple sidewalk tables outside I heard staff tell customers they could use \"Just make sure the baskets come back inside!\"The staff was fantastic. They were pretty attentive considering at any time you were less than five feet away from one of the them honing their craft.The food. It's exactly what you would expect with the name like the place has. Phillys and anything that would typically come out of mom's chicken fryer pan. The ribeye was good quality and they did something I really hadn't seen before. The onion and peppers were pre-diced and mixed with the meat. Typically it's prepped on the side of the grill and swept into the meat on order. I didn't mind this at all and it was small dice so you didn't get a big hunk of onion or green pepper. It was there to flavor the sandwich and that was what it did. Choices of cheese...cheese whiz or provolone. I didn't see the provolone used at all while we were there. The roll is very close to an authenticate amoroso roll. Firm yet soft. Not tough to bite, but it held together well enough to cradle the meat and cheese without getting soggy. This made me happy. The chef/owner said it took him a long time to find a local hoagie roll he was happy with.The fresh chicken they offered was hand breaded in front of you and dropped into the fryer. I really wanted to try the chicken too, but I was there for the cheesesteak.I thank God this place isn't in Des Moines or I'd be eating there every day. My gf didn't exactly feel the same way, but I think that's because she stuck out like a sore thumb. The place has a boys' club feel to it. Like when a woman walks into an old school barber shop and everyone gets really quiet...Was it an authentic Philadelphia cheesesteak? My time in Philadelphia tells me not exactly...but for a Midwest facsimile it was damn near on point.The two sandwiches, sides (fries and jalapeno cheese balls), and drinks ran $24 and change before tip if I recall correctly. Everything was served right off the grill or out of the fryer to a basket directly in front of you. Fresh and hot. I'd go back again and again.Date of actual visit:  06/08/2017"}, {"review_id": "wSCf0t7Ix5u7Kh5pYgShzQ", "user_id": "SRx7YS2CLDv4qzGIO06NqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2017", "text": "What a great find!  You sit at the counter and get a great Philly Cheesesteak.  Nothing fancy or complicated.  Just good ribeye, whiz, and Swiss.   Got to go back and try the fried chicken.  It looked legit."}, {"review_id": "04V2efAW4-2wyhMiPMdpaQ", "user_id": "KoPwti-I8E849cEWG9s3yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "Legit Philly style food in a great lunch counter setting.  Everything was delicious.  I'd recommend applying as much love into the sides as you do the sandwiches.  Hand breaded rings would kill with your sandwiches."}, {"review_id": "Muj5hxmKpCzZXjmiXs0A2w", "user_id": "W9lXcRiAPfCJU-51D4A4yA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Killer sandwich, amazing sub roll that makes it.  It is a little whole in the wall but the fellas there take care of you and serve that Philly that'll keep you going back over and over."}, {"review_id": "zabyxOvwm1WGqi1OSqNXtg", "user_id": "_VKyCOvtRfyLzrMDxZev9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/18/2016", "text": "When your focus is two things Phillys, and Chicken you're bound to do it right! Small diner with barley enough room to set next to your neighbor without bumping elbows. Friendly staff who are ultra quick. Of course I had the cheese steak, and one drumstick. The meat on the steak was fresh, and moist topped with swiss, and wiz! I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't any pepper's on it, but the bread was great. The chicken seasoning was spot on! A nice blend of heat, and salt. Crispy skin with a moist center honestly better than my grandmother's. It was also great to bite into a fry that was crisp. Definitely a must stop for any chick/cheese steak lover."}, {"review_id": "UgJ4cRaUQ9cbYdSd1AVp-g", "user_id": "soFI7kQo0fUSWlnJeD75tw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2016", "text": "Dang great food.  Service was great.  Staff was awesome  Matt is great.  Thanks man.
