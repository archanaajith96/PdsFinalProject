Seems to be steamed instead of the typical fried gyoza. They came out piping hot with a variety of vegetables dotting the plate including shishito pepper, and carrots which were delicious in their own right. Ocean Picante Who would have thought this combination could be so delectable? As soon as it hits your mouth you taste the wonderful spice of the peppercorn salmon, the jalapenos, the garlic chili oil all placed on top. Then, as you bite, you encounter the lovely crunch of the fried asparagus and the sweet beauty of the spicy tuna. It's executed absolutely perfectly. The rice is properly portioned, the serving is ample. Well worth the price. Tamago You guys. I think I've just had the best egg of my life. Marinated with sugar and soy sauce, this egg sashimi absolutely MELTS in your mouth. I just couldn't have enough of it. Peppercorn SalmonThis comes as a sashimi or sushi order - something I've never seen before in a sushi restaurant and something I never knew I needed until now. Although the regular sake sashimi is much thicker, I think the compromise of having that fresh peppercorn is very worth it. The restaurant is packed even late on a thursday. Be prepared to sit through the loud roar of guests experiencing pure ecstacy. Admist all this, the servers do exceptionally well. Kata Robata is like a well oiled machine, delivering happiness in the form of food to its customers.Parking is pretty limited since the area is shared by several other businesses. But complimentary valet is offered.  Be sure to make a reservation if you don't want to wait."}, {"review_id": "qtfjDE95jv5otKPGiav-zA", "user_id": "ctvw26SHB32p8ipEr2I-fQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "While in Houston, I wanted to try the best Japanese restaurants (owned/operated by Japanese) that the city had to offer. Kata came up on my search and so I tried it out. I came on a Sunday night as a walk in. They were busy, but were able to seat me at the sushi counter in about 10 minutes.I asked for omakase and my server confirmed it with one of the chefs to see if they would be able to accommodate me. Most of the fish was fresh. I was surprised to see Hokkaido uni (or maybe Russian uni fished off of Hokkaido?) on the menu. The only real issue I had was with the Santa Barbara uni. It was not fresh and I would say borderline bad (I've had plenty of SB uni and I know what fresh uni is supposed to taste like).All in all, it wasn't a horrendous meal. The food is decent and they draw in a large crowd (albeit I didn't see/hear any Japanese people here). The service here is okay and will suffice. I think the next time I'm visiting Houston, I'll try other establishments for a comparison."}, {"review_id": "pWeqiVEW_8ZWnTwxCVswsw", "user_id": "LRCC0mvor9Ll8OoiRnksbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Kata does not disappoint. Even with new sushi restaurants opening around Houston, I feel Kata comes on top. Kata does an amazing job keeping the essence of traditional with a modern twist. The service is top notch and the quality of food is superb. I think most of Houston will agree with me since this place is always busy whether it be lunch or dinner. I recommend the Omakase, the price will vary on how many pieces and what the chef picks. The other items off the menu is delicious as well."}, {"review_id": "55wPv1j9OSX79W58FSqNDA", "user_id": "PtaxFcT0uJxh3pYVtrBOAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "There are a number of excellent sushi restaurants in and around Houston and Kata Robata should certainly be considered amongst those that are an at least once visited. Firstly let's start with the diversity of the sushi menu which is prpobably the best way to judge the volume of the best sushi bars. Kata Robata has both the predictable standby's such as Hamachi (yellowtail) and Sake (salmon not rice wine) but likewise seasonal favorites such as Uni (urchin is always best with a quail egg BTW) and Fresh Amaebo (should be ordered in multiples hence Amebi) quite sweet and when the heads are deveined and fried correctly (as they were in this case) an absolute balance...a shrimp Yin Yang.Next of course (or of equal consequence should I say) is the sushi cut which in this case is quite generous and commensurate with the price and quality of the shushi as wel as the service which is impeccable, pleasant and not overbearing. Pick you pace and you can be accomodated with both the most pleasant and skillful chefs if you choose the sushi bar (my favorite so you both see and can discuss your meal) or servers who are equally attentive even if you are sitting at the sushi bar.Lastly is the ambience which in the case of Kata Robata is trendy and quite attractive. In summary this restaurant is the 'whole package', has a robust drink menu, a diversity of sake's (the drink in this case) ample and convenient parking and an attentive staff from your entry, to bussing...it is a clearly a pleasant experience,"}, {"review_id": "k1scIovMLTU1qA1Vy8faBQ", "user_id": "71h2P18M0DLjIDQR7uNlgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Kata is quite possibly my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Houston.  First off, happy hour all day Sunday is amazing.  Second, service is incredibly friendly.  And most important, the food is ahhhhhh-mazing!  holy moly where have you been all my life.  The highlights--Beef skewers (not on hh menu) - So freaking tender and the tastes just bursts in your mouth.  Highly recommend.Lobster Mac & Cheese (not on hh menu) - Also really amazing.  They do not skimp on the lobster.  The chunks of lobster in every bite and the combo with the mac and cheese was just exquisite.Baos - meh it was ok.  not amazing but not disgusting.  nothing to write home about.Uni (not on the hh menu) - So buttery and so delicious.  HIGHLY recommend.Longhorn roll - Simply deliciousThis place is a bit pricey but definitely worth it!"}, {"review_id": "4F-0aaswj3MHXks8JcyFpw", "user_id": "PGJ4eb-8tmvea3XzqIdc_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "If you want fine dining sushi, this is the place to check out! I recommend making a rsvp esp for a weekend night as it can be quite packed. There's plenty of parking for the restaurant so that's a plus. For starter, we ordered a papaya and pork belly salad. It was so good and light. We also ordered fresh oysters which was good. The dish was only two pieces though so I was quite sad after my slurp. Our other dishes include sushi roll and chef's assorted sashimi. The sashimi selection was amazing and each sashimi was thick enough in cut. To finish the dinner, we ended with warm blueberry cake with earl gray lemon ice cream. It was so good!

Ribs - yummy and falling off the bone. It only came with 3 though :(Beef skewers - holy moly get these. To die for. Get them. You won't regret it.

My first is MF sushi of course.Every time I come here I always have such an outstanding experience! A tip from me is that you always want to try to make a reservation because the wait time is ridiculous on a busy day like Thursday-Saturday. One time I came here with one of my girlfriends and we waited about 45 minutes and it was on a Thursday I believe. (Our fault we didn't make a reservation) Another time we came here and had a reservation and still had to wait about 10 minutes which was frustrating since we had a reservation.. but the foods worth it so what right?Most of the servers here are attentive and quick. There was one time I felt that I had a new waitress because she was lacking a few things and she was kinda behind because it seemed she had the entire back patio section. Another time, the waitress didn't offer us some hot towels before our meal. But other than that we have had great service.I always seem to get the Japanese Amberjack Sashimi with Foie Gras! That's always my go to and appetizer. The flavor is perfect and the Foi Gras is to die for. It's like a burst of goodness in your mouth.For my meal, I got the Rising sun, Texas Hamachi, Salmon sashimi, O toro, Uni, Spicy chopped scallopA5 wagyu, bone marrow and I got 6 pieces of Foie Gras.-Rising sun 5/5-Texas Hamachi 5/5-Salmon Sashmi 5/5-O toro 3/5-spicy chopped scallop 4/5-A5 wagyu 5/5-bone marrow 3/5-Foie gras 3/5 it's either a hit or miss, sometimes it perfect, sometimes it's too fatty and the pieces are large and a little hard. When you're paying the price for Foie gras you want it seared just right.I've also tried the spicy soy ramen and I wasn't too much of a fan with the spicy soy. One time I got them to split it and they charged us a fee for splitting it.. if I knew that I would've just asked for a bowl and split it myself. Other than that, I absolutely love this place! Love girls dinner here and obviously will come back!"}, {"review_id": "9vUew9mOy4Hzwb-wP1LujA", "user_id": "oAij0wBNMueKVUcDv3qLdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "This was definitely a great romantic sushi place with high quality freshness. It was extremely packed on a Saturday night but my bf made reservations prior to arriving. I would suggest doing rsvp first so you can be guaranteed a quick table ready! Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with describing each dish that we had questions on. Each dish tasted amazing and unique! The fish were fresh and had no fishiness smell to it at all. Definitely worth the visit. The sashimi for two is highly recommended by yours truly. It's huge and will meet your aesthetic expectations. Not to mention each fish was exquisite and fresh. I really loved the fatty tuna. The king crab with uni spoon was so fun and light, and left me wanting more spoons haha.The Caribbean roll was really yummy and they really stuffed the lobster in there. It's great if raw fish isn't your thing. The bone marrow with toast was..SO YUMMY. The only thing I have to say is the toast seemed to be so airy with various big holes that it made it hard to place my bone marrow on. Other than that, loved it and PRO TIP: don't skip out on the toppings and esp the lime juice. It really gives it another dimension. The scallops and foie gras tasted just as good as they looked. The scallops were enormous in size and sliced in half, so you get a total of 2 scallops on that plate with the foie gras but definitely worth. Overall, I would come back for any special occasion or date involving a sushi craving."}, {"review_id": "HtPeYTV-GAQB18V1Y6Jaiw", "user_id": "R9YKpPY0Q4LMxF_muYjY1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "I can't believe it's taken me so long to write a review, since I've been eating here for years. Kata is one of my fave sushi spots in town, but they also have amazing \"kitchen food\" like oxtail ramen, miso cod, and lobster mac & cheese - just to name a few. They used to have a sea bass that i loved, but it's no longer on the menu. Regardless, everything I've had there has been delicious!My favorite roll is the rising sun because, well... who doesn't love truffle?  All of their sushi is super fresh - from salmon to hamachi (yellowtail) & jalapeno, to spicy chopped scallop, to fatty tuna. My mouth is literally watering. They also have an amberjack sashimi that they serve w/ foie gras that is absolutely amazing. There are so many options, and honestly, I've never had anything bad there. Don't forget to get some A5 wagyu sashimi too! Best in town! If you still have room in your tummy, which you usually do when eating sushi, try the warm blueberry cake or banana creme brûlée. Not too heavy but oh so satisfying!Service is great, but make sure you make a reservation, especially if it's for HH or dinner. Speaking of which their HH menu is AMAZING! Only \"complaint\" about this place is parking. Somehow the lot is always full. I almost forgot to talk about their full bar. They have a variety of sake too, but my new fave drink is their spicy Pims.

I highly recommend getting reservations bc there is always a wait and they are a very busy restaurant. Some of my favorite items in their menu are the:Kobe beef skewers: SO tender and full of flavor 5/5Pork belly: tender pork belly with a 64 degree egg and buttery garlicy spinach 4/5Madai with truffle: thin pieces of madai topped with fresh truffle and a ponzu like sauce 5/5Soy pork ramen: interesting flavor because it's slightly sweet 4/5Texas hamachi roll: 4/5Rising sun roll: pepper tuna and truffle 4/5Scallop topped with foie: 5/5Uni crab spoon: 5/5Bone marrow: 4/5Their sushi is usually pretty good but I'm usually quite let down by their chu-toro which had one small corner of fat but almost completely red and lean. I've also had their omakase that was around $125-150. It didn't have as much sushi as I wanted and had more dishes like foie chawanmushi, wagyu, and fried soft shell crab but I left the restaurant way more full than other omakases.

It's definitely pricier sushi, but I think their quality reflects the price. Here I wouldn't waste my money on the rolls....why spend good money to cover the taste of fresh sashimi with sauce if the fish is fresh enough to stand out on its own? And the sushi is where this place excels. I love ordering off the seasonal menu because it's truly seasonal...you may not see it again!Outside of sushi though, their oxtail ramen is also enough reason to come. The broth is strong, but not because it's very salty or heavy in flavoring. It's that depth of flavor you get from hours of simmering. At peak hours parking here does get annoying though so I'd recommend carpooling if possible."}, {"review_id": "y8cgYFeSE5q08KSY9nGfFg", "user_id": "zUuqiib4c1gtftJs4MWjvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "Who goes to sushi restaurant and order tonkotsu?

The broth and the noodle and the ajitama were all great! The broth has a strong ginger flavor, so may be stay away if you're not a fan. The pork was a tad bit on the dry side. Still a solid bowl. My friend tried the miso ramen and, perhaps I was just preferring a more flavorful bowl that afternoon, I actually liked her bowl better.
