Our server kept forgetting about us, the hosts never even made eye contact with us, the food was cold upon arrival. All in all, a horrible experience.    Friday night, we found ourselves in down town Greensboro once again. With every other restaurant packed already, we decided to give crafted one last attempt. We signed in with the small Arabic/Mediterranean woman at the counter (we never got her name). She was awesome!Actually made eye contact and made us feel welcomed and taken care of. She was so warm and friendly, we were comfortable enough to confide in her about or horrible last visit. She INSISTED to make sure that our second experience would change our mind. She got us moved up the line and seated as quickly as possible. She made sure that we got the best server in the whole restaurant that night. Even though it was dinner time and it was packed, she stopped by our table even more than our own server just to make sure we were doing okay. No matter how busy she looked, she would always stop by. I don't see much kindness and compassion in the world too much these days, but this young woman restored my faith in that and we are so grateful! The only reason we will find ourselves back at crafted, is if she is at the front desk. She is the reason we changed our minds (and we never change our minds)."}, {"review_id": "ZT2-oNla1MZb4ZgO2bWWCA", "user_id": "ybxeL_zWJG_Z-KTO7FrXhA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Was excited to go after hearing so many people rave about it. We went on Friday at 5:15pm. We got seated right away and the hostess and server were friendly and attentive. I got a Fixie (braised beef) and a Po' Boy. Fixie: Too much chili sauce on it because it overpowered all the other flavors except the beef, which was a poached-mushy consistency. Sitting in it's juices being kept warm for too long. Cilantro and scallions were a no-show... like one slice of each. Po' Boy was better but the flour tortilla was dried out and cracking around the edges. Best part of the meal was the taquitos. Very good but if you don't like a little heat with your food ... like my wife... ask for a different sauce than  the sweet tomato chipotle aioli. Maybe I'll go back one day to try a burger but these are not the tacos I was searching for. 2 of us shared an appetizer, each got a drink, I had an one entree, and my wife had another app as her meal. $48. It wasn't a lot of food. I expect better execution for that price point and quantity of food."}, {"review_id": "jPv5a-qmYaYMKXJiVwo0xQ", "user_id": "oST-2zCg19CFhiIEVwaKlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Enjoy these tasty tacos because they are a treat!

And they lost it.This USED to be in our top three places to eat. Once you're in the top three it's hard to pick one. Not any more.No longer is it a \"cool\" place to get really good food with really good service. Now it's too big for its own good. I am sure they are making money but this is our last visit unless there is some confirmation from someone out there that there have been MAJOR changes. Waits were common before but obscene now. Many of the tables will be empty and you still have to wait, unless you get lucky and there is a bar stool open.Then the real fun starts. We have been here three times now. The first two, we chalked it up to \"new\". But that doesn't explain the apparent overhaul of the staff. No more familiar faces - and the new ones have no clue. The first two times, both of our orders came out wrong, both times. Macaroni and cheese quesadilla add chicken came out as a cheese quesadilla both visits. \"Oh, we'll bring you some macaroni and some chicken then you can put it together the way you like it\". Thanks for doing us the favor of letting us build our own combination cold and hot quesadilla!Gluten free is gluten free. Write it down and dont bring me flour tortillas!!! Period!!! And I'm sorry, if you are in the food service industry waiting on the public, dont look at the person ordering gluten free like they are working a foreign language! Know your menu, be prepared! And stop using new as an excuse. This place didn't just open, it just moved across the freakin' street for crying out loud!I guess the blank look of the manager was the final straw. He just stood there looking around when we tried to discuss with him what we noticed was wrong, he just shrugged and so ok. Like it didn't matter.We spent the past several years going to Crafted Taco at least once a week and usually twice. I can no longer stomach the ruination of what was a classic, hip, trendy, wonderful foodie destination. I am truly sorry to see it gone.Hopefully, someone will start listening and make an effort, unless, of course, they are too busy opening the next location."}, {"review_id": "3NY_Mw3hII2VeIJM6UYq8Q", "user_id": "9CfKBBptDTzENPp3_HqohA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I'm finally here.  I kept hearing about this place.  I started with a beer order, decent menu... small pour for the price.  That was sad.  Ordered 2 tacos and a side.  The food was good, not great.  I bought the tuna taco and pork with mac n cheese.  I felt like i needed to add seasoning....i didn't but felt that way.   The flavor was basic/ok.  Their mac n cheese side was good.  They seemed more focused on closing at 9:30 then serving, which is also sad.  The environment was nice, but really they were closing 30 min before closing... not good service seems created a negative value for my time and $$$."}, {"review_id": "etLaFGbrVBeXaCCCf4S29Q", "user_id": "p7lGy7rxdThN7Q5gKae-9A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Well, not every meal can be a winner... I was in town for work and a good friend of mine recommended this place for dinner. I love tacos and so I opted to eat here instead of barbecue. The place was packed, server was great and the sides (sweet potato chips and greens) were perfect. The main attraction, the tacos, we're less than desirable. After the first few bites of my Oxford I noticed everything was cold. So then I tried my Fixie and it was cold too. I asked my waitress if these were actually supposed to be cold tacos. By her face, I knew the obvious answer.  My corn tortillas felt like they just came out of the fridge. She did offer to have new tacos made but, at this point it was getting late and I wanted to get back to the hotel to finish up some work for an early morning. She asked if I was done and I said yes. She took my plate with, 1 and half tocos on it, and  she brings me my bill, the entire bill, all $20 worth. No manager visit, no follow up, no nothing.Crazy... I've actually worked in the restaurant and hospitality business for the past 20 years and typically eat out 15 to 20 times a week. So, for me to have an experience like this is strange. I've always thought Yelp reviews like this were made by crazy people. Well here I am... I'll give them another shot in a couple weeks when I come back but, just know these are not supposed to be cold tacos..."}, {"review_id": "RwcWn9CdxRZXtzqWAyj7Dw", "user_id": "5uJTJnINckyAchF6mf7sLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Consistently good food with efficient friendly service.  New location a bit of an echo chamber.

Definitely worth the drive! There's lots to pick from, and they let you mix N match your tacos. I had the beef taco and beer battered fish taco, with a side of pimento cheese mac  the only reason I'm giving 4 of 5 stars is due to too much creamy sauces in the fish taco. Next time I'll get it \"dry\". The beef taco and Mac were melt in your mouth delicious and full of flavor! I also had a pineapple mimosa- would have had more if I wasn't driving and didn't have so far TO drive. I would suggest to arrive right when they open, as this spot fills up fast.

One star for the side dishes, one star for the decor. First, the wait. Crafted doesn't accept reservations. We heard that the food was good and wanted to give it a try, so we decided to sign up for a table. It took almost an hour for us to be seated. Second (this is a minor critique), the menu. The \"Box Truck\" option offers three different tacos (instead of two of the same kind plus a side), but you can't sub any of them out (we tried to get one subbed because a member of the party doesn't eat red meat). I get that, in some restaurants, changes to the menu cannot be accommodated for whatever reason, but we're talking about tacos here. Additionally, although the menu says that Crafted offers both flour and corn tortillas, we were not given an option. Third, the food. The tacos were only so-so. I'd give the \"Bow Tie\" (beer battered fish with guac, roasted corn and poblano salsa, honey mustard, chipotle aioli, and crumbled queso and cilantro) a 4/5, but the \"Po Boy\" (fried shrimp with pico, a cajun remoulade, and spicy pickles) was super disappointing. The shrimp was pretty flavorless and the dish (as a whole) lacked cohesion. In addition, the taco seemed to be made of mostly iceberg lettuce and was bland and messy. Definitely will not be coming back. Not worth the wait, or the money."}, {"review_id": "iPm-1Tuo-mvLq2erHt7K9g", "user_id": "q1kbqjao7jHcorNlUZ8gGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "Located in downtown Greensboro, this is a small taco shop that you MUST visit if you are in town.

This time I ordered their Chori Burger (medium well) and OMG. BOMB.COM. The burger was also nice and thick and the patty was bigger than the bun.The burger had a sunny side up egg, avocado slices, queso sauce, and chorizo.I ordered a side of chips and pico. The pita chips are delicious, nice and flaky, I'm sure they might be made in house. The inly down side is that the pico was a little salty, but that was resolved by sipping some water.DEFINITELY VISIT HERE!

While they have the traditional Mexican style tacos, they also have seared tuna, pulled pork, and Asian fusion tacos.On my most recent visit, I ordered the Fedora and Bow tie tacos. I loved both, but particularly the seared tuna with the Asian flavors! When you order, you get 2 tacos and can mix and match the varieties, just pay the higher price.They seem to have a good selection of local beers available.

We each opted for the side of pico and chips.They were delicious!! The service was great, tacos were awesome...even the beer selection was on point but we opted for a light, affordable PBR for $1.50 with lunch.
