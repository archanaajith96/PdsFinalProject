The atmosphere is decent . Unfortunately, the customer service is a bit on the insufficient side of things . I went in on a brisk Thursday evening for my go to; (a triple shot caramel latte with a dash of honey). My order was taken by a rude barista who insisted she was unable to make my drink because of the \"high complexity\". Appalled , I left with a simple vanilla cappuccino. Needless to say, the cappuccino was pretty good. Will consider giving this joint another chance ."}, {"review_id": "kMv6ND1Dwfa2HHf4U73mrg", "user_id": "7eLlcBpcaqOFDhWPpdPY5A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "What folks don't tell you here--amongst all the glowing reviews--is that the coffee is just GROSSLY expensive. Is it good?!? Yes. Is it great?!? Yes. But ... come on. That doesn't mean you can commit highway robbery, right?  And like folks have said, there's no WiFi. (And, yes--it's 2018. WiFi is ubiquitous now. Folks rely on it for so many different reasons. They might as well say, \"Oh; I'm sorry. We don't have electricity.\" LOL)And the hut, while quaint, is acoustically horrible. Oh, and the pastries in the case are near the floor. What's with that?!? Why in the world would you showcase baked goods near the FLOOR?!?!?  Ick. So, sure. If you have money to burn and want to put out $10 for two lattes ... have at it!!! :-)"}, {"review_id": "5reILHXdoK2rcARQm_SdXg", "user_id": "dKCEIzXWKjQoorZ4R6PBvg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/4/2017", "text": "Excellent coffee. After roadtrip gas station coffee we were dying for something good and BCR fit the bill. For starters it's an inviting space. It was a hot day and the front of the building was wide open letting a breeze in. It's an old Quonset hut with high ceilings and a chill industrial vibe. Staff was very friendly and the coffee was delicious. I have to say my taste runs to a darker roast. The two coffees I tried were a little light for my taste but still very flavorful. We grabbed a couple of bags to try at home. The Vinyl smells delicious and I can't wait to try it. This is definitely a great place to stop if you're in town."}, {"review_id": "XEYqSpg5UunsFgx9nQe0jw", "user_id": "BSlJdsMo9sWaunHxw19x4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2017", "text": "Looking for the best third wave coffee roaster in Missoula? Look no further! Black Coffee is the perfect place, whether you're just passing through town or are hanging out a while longer. Consistently good single origin and blended coffee beans. along with four seasonal offerings (Hunt, Drift, Bloom, and Topo). All are excellent choices for taking home with you. If you purchase a refillable metal canister, you can get a free cup of drip when you purchase 12oz. or more of fresh beans (or a discount on espresso drinks). There are also Hario filters and other coffee making gear for sale, including a range of cool hats, shirts, and hoodies branded with the distinctive Black Coffee Roasting Company logo. I first encountered Black Coffee at their earlier location on Wyoming Street, behind the Good Foods Store and near to Bayern brewery. I loved the intimate, off the beaten path feel to the place, where beans were always being roasted (so it seemed) and the music was choice. You felt like you were in the know on something trendy in town, and you were pleased to have found such quality coffee being made and served by very cool people.When space got too tight, Black Coffee relocated to the current Spruce Street location, which is bigger and closer to the downtown and I-90 corridor, so it can get crowded at times with long lines. Because it's also close to the University of Montana campus, most of the time there will be a lot of students buried in their laptops, tablets, or books, along with ultra-fit Missoula moms and dads wrapped in expensive microfleece and 800 fill down jackets that would not look out of place on the slopes of Mount Hood or the snow-covered streets of Park City. Pastries from Le Petit Outre are available fresh each day, and the thick-cut toast options showcase some really good local ingredients, like Wuestner Brothers clover honey, along with tasty things like avocado, Maldon sea salt flakes, and Nutella.I suppose you could compare Black Coffee to places in the Pacific NW or the Bay Area, but the truth of the matter is that today's Montana has its own craft coffee tradition that doesn't simply emulate others. Whether you are in Hamilton, Helena, Bozeman, Butte, or Whitefish, you'll find quality roasted coffee and well made espressos, pourovers, and baked goods. Just search for them on Yelp; chances are better than 50/50 that you'll be impressed. This is most definitely the case with Black Coffee! Try a single origin cortado next time you're in town, or order a Worka pourover, one of their best Ethiopian offerings with tons of blueberry flavor. Don't forget to ask about the availability of their seasonal blends, which can be really, really good and are only around for a few weeks each year. There is an advertised daily coffee special, too, which can encourage you to try something new, rather than just rely upon your dependable coffee standbys. Part of the pleasure of coming to Black Coffee is discovering a new microlot of exotic coffee that you may never have tasted before, so bring a spirit of adventure when you come. Hope you'll enjoy your visit as much as I always did!"}, {"review_id": "o7COIvdm2W1tSeuZnBfCgg", "user_id": "1qVdTRCL5saKWU8NTNFs7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "HECK YES, this is what I was looking for and I found it.

ALSO they make their own dairy free milks in house! That's neat-o! The employees are friendly and the music is great too. I wish I lived in Missoula I would spend all my time/money here!

I recently came here with my mom to get coffee. It was pretty quiet and we were the only ones in line. We ordered, my mom gets her drink, and I wait.. and wait.. and wait. My name is never called, but I don't want to seem impatient and I figured they had to be working on it. And now a big group comes in and orders, they all get their drinks, and now I realize mine is not coming. I went up to the counter to ask about it and the guy behind the counter wasn't even a little bit apologetic. It was kind of like, \"Huh, ok, we'll work on it.\" I understand things happen, but I waited 15 min for a simple drink when it wasn't busy and he didn't seem very concerned about it.On the plus side, their toast is delicious.
