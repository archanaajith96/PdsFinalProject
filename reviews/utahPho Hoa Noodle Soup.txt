Everything else is average. The egg rolls are below average. I've been here on and off for a number of years, I think the owner has changed once or twice. The pho broth is good here, so come for the pho, probably find somewhere else for all of the other wonderful Vietnamese dishes.

This place gets poppin so make sure you get a table while you can if you come in and its not overflowing with crowds.Judging by the shopping center I was a little skeptical at first but then having had their food I was like okay, TRUST them based off of how good their pho was and I forgot to ask about gluten free options so I don't know if the brown dark kind of sweet sauce you put in your pho was gluten free or not.Judging by my stomach ache after I'm going to assume it wasn't but that was my bad for not asking! I got a taro boba drink and I asked if it was non dairy and she said they have a pre mix that is only using non dairy milk or creamer, but then when the boba drink came there was whip cream on it. I probably should have asked to avoid that but I wasn't used to taro coming with whip cream on it. Regardless I still give this place a solid four stars."}, {"review_id": "Xt-M5pQeSKwO2PA339u_Fg", "user_id": "n50bVcc_WkgNCc-88gZHvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "Un-Pho-gettable.I LOVE the Avocado Boba, Pile of basil or mint, Dish of extra fish sauce, Small Pho is large.I come back for the Boba and end up grabbing Pho.  It is always filling and the flavor is consistent.  Tables that seat 4 or more with baby chairs on hand.  I have made a total mess of this place with my kids and they fix things quickly.Payment is at the counter so don't wait for the \"waiter\" to come back. It's a sit-down, immediately receive Pho (Vermacellia takes longer), and never see a waiter again - type of place. Some days they are missing herbs but if it is on hand, you get a large portion of additions.

Yeah there are cheaper bowls of pho nearby, but they will contain a thick layer of grease and not as much flavor.  The servers aren't the most chatty or friendly, but they do their best to make sure you have everything you need for your meal.  Make sure to ask for a fork [if needed!] when the pho bowls arrive to the table, otherwise they might forget.  Water refills are not the most prompt but luckily the cups are large."}, {"review_id": "rUSAUy6dPYvqmWjWQBlv5g", "user_id": "qN_1bIc-BMKnw2xnezsCmQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "I use to LOVE this pho place.

It is potent on the coffee side but seriously so good. Perfect amount of coffee/ sweet.

Chicken pho- The broth is clear and not oily which I like but the chicken was overcooked and was very dry.  I had to use a lot of condiments to fight the dry and overcooked flavor. Beef pho- The beef was cooked perfectly but for a large bowl it had a mere 2 pieces of meat.  Spring rolls- The veggies looked wilted and brown.  I usually finish my spring rolls but at Pho Hoa I took one bite and I was finished.  The large bowl looks like a medium.  They fill your bowl here with a ton of broth but barely any noodles and meat.  If they're trying to charge me a large bc they added an extra half cup of broth but skimped on the meat and noodles, we have a problem. Go elsewhere for your pho. It's west valley so pho joints pretty much are everywhere.  Asia palace is in the same parking lot as Pho Hoa and I actually enjoy their pho.  There are too many inconsistencies here for me to return but the staff is super friendly and attentive so it makes the meal bearable."}, {"review_id": "xX9KoEQT2vC9kG5TQ8x3SA", "user_id": "RStLwQT4PbkN3eZpsITSmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2017", "text": "Best Pho in the greater Salt Lake area.

I use to go here since I was a child. It was always great but as time passed it just went downhill. I know how it is to be in the serving industry but I was very disappointed with my last visit. When I arrived, we immediately got seated so that was great. But there wasn't anyone there so fast service is what I expected. One of the kitchen staff came by and I tried ordering the food first in a very clear tone and she said okay and just walked off, she didn't wait to hear my friends order. So he had to speak up while she had her back pointed towards him. The food came out within five minutes and we still didn't get our water. My friend asked the person from the kitchen to get us our waters as she brought out our food. The waitress never came back to check on us to see how we were doing. I didn't see her since she sat us down. Usually I get a small plate to put sriracha and hoisin sauce in but I noticed every single bottle in the whole shop was missing, I guess they were just refilling it. But I don't get is why they can't just leave them at the tables where people are actually sitting at so we can use them with ease and don't have to constantly wave them down and asks for condiments. My friend asked the kitchen staff if we could get the hoisin sauce right before we got our food. I was too distracted by on conversation to see that they came by and dropped of the hoisin sauce. Once the food came , I tried to perfect my pho bowl with all the vegetables and then 10 minutes later into my bowl , my friend asked if I used the hoisin sauce because they just took it away. That was really frustrating. I was just too tired to deal with it today. I would really think they would have at least one of them already filled up just to leave at the table for the rest of the meal. They shouldn't have taken that long to be filled since the restaurant  was empty.  I was nearly done with my bowl and noticed there was a male server and other customers came , he didn't check on us but those other people seemed like they were getting better service than the other girl that us down. I usually don't put out the time to post a review but I just felt like this had to be said. Overall, food has been content as always but the service was terrible. I hate to be that person but I didn't tip. I don't think they deserved it. There was no one else  in the restaurant and I couldn't even get decent service. I understand that there is a language barrier but it shouldn't  prevent a person from being a good server and providing at least decent service. I hope they make some changes in their staff to have better mannerism and a smile once in awhile wouldn't hurt."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-hoa-noodle-soup-west-valley-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
