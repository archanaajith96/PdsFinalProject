Five stars goes to restaurants who set a consistently high bar for service and quality food. This is it for sushi in Eugene! On this visit, we tried a number of rolls to share: The Ninja, The Yakuza, Inside Out California, and The Firecracker. Our toddler had his own kids bento box for which we chose teriyaki chicken. It also comes with a fresh cucumber salad, veggie & 1 shrimp tempura with all the coordinating sauces for dipping. With a note about the price, it can be a little bit pricey when you get 2 rolls per person, but we find the freshness and flavor of the sushi to be well worth it. Hands down! Always family friendly, and great for a night out, celebrating occasions, and even a casual lunch. Make note that there is no lunch on Sundays and you're good any other time! Sushi Pure is our favorite place in Eugene!"}, {"review_id": "ras5utXzinSZU1tDH95Ghg", "user_id": "s7qFhPQgZq_po9ffh_Icpg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "This would be a great date spot!! I loved the interior look with dark wood booths/tables accented by interesting Asian art.Tasty sushi, pretty plate presentations and attentive service. Our server was super patient as our group hemmed and hawed over which rolls to order. We went with a few of her recommendations too, and everything was good. I feel that the prices are on the higher side, so this likely won't become my go-to sushi place here (I'm still locating all my options in Eugene) but it still is an viable option."}, {"review_id": "8iPtfEQdgpFaKbQg22ANOA", "user_id": "nLlqVb9hSApy4D8pT_pKLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Love the food! Love the service! I made a reservation for a surprise birthday dinner a couple days ahead. There was a $75 deposit fee, which was fine. I gave one less star because of the miscommunication between the host and I; he was not clear about the $250 minimum. The manager was very accommodating and understanding and waived that fee - although we spent maybe more than the $250 minimum requirement.One problem is that my guests arrived before I did and because I did not sign the agreement, they were not allowed to be seated. Keep in mind that the restaurant has my credit card information already so I do not understand this policy. This ruined the surprise I had planned for my friend which really bummed everyone out. A majority of the party drove up from Portland and just wished everything went smoothly. I brought this to the mamager's attention and she was very understanding and apologetic.I would definitely come back here again and would recommend this place to anyone! I understand that there is miscommunication sometimes and I'm just very happy with the service we received even after this awkward encounter. We all still had a good experience at sushi pure and glad everything worked out!"}, {"review_id": "jxENAcVYGdXMrA1XgJE_bg", "user_id": "qrNWjc4JPywcQ9rOBrosJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Stopped in for lunch on the recommendation of someone local I was working with. We were discussing good sushi and he recommended Sushi Pure as one of, if not, the best sushi restaurants in Eugene; of which apparently there are a lot.Popped in about 11:45 and it was pretty deserted so got a nice booth looking at the bar. The interior design was interesting and kept my attention and the waitress was excellent. I normally get the same 6-10 nigiri rolls I like but thought I'd change it up and go with the chefs choice for 6 pieces of nigiri and a California roll. Not really a fan of California rolls but was curious about the chefs choice so rolled :) with it. It was purple rice which I honestly haven't seen before but was quite delicious. The presentation was excellent (see photo) and the nigiri was fresh and very flavorful. I ate there a day ago from this review so I can't remember the actual pieces but should be obvious from the photo. I was seriously considering coming back for dinner but as my food adventure in Eugene had been going so well, I figured I would try someplace else. Oh, the selection also came with a bowl of Miso."}, {"review_id": "VRLxCttJ5j9re0ALawP0aw", "user_id": "nEnvPEBoZE5pR5700Afw7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Always good food always good service always good quality.

As many have mentioned, the \"black\" rice is really unique and something that sets this place apart. Trendy, fun atmosphere in the 5th street market area of Eugene. Sushi was all fresh and presented beautifully (I am really intrigued by the \"boat\" option as well). Not many options if you are into baked or fried sushi, but there were definitely enough options to keep us more than satisfied. Great spot for a date night for the sushi lover in your life!"}, {"review_id": "qSbronspNTUWEoFw08_NkA", "user_id": "GaIe8R1VsUmR4LY9f5Xl1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Cute place.

Wow! This sushi spot feels authentic and taste authentic. The fish is fresh, and the sushi isn't overly drenched in sauces like other places.

I have been wanting to try this place for a long time, so when my sister came into town on her birthday, I finally seized the opportunity to go here! I am just sad it took me so long to do so! Our waiter was so nice and when we asked for a good roll recommendation, he did not steer us wrong. We tried three different rolls and all of them were so good. The fish was so fresh and I really enjoyed the purple rice along with whatever they season it with. The sauces they put on two of the rolls were so flavorful too! I can't say which roll was my favorite because they honestly were all so good. The prices are high, but the rolls are big and the atmosphere is intimate and on the \"fancier\" side. The sushi rolls are worth the price. I honestly can't wait to come back here and try some more rolls!"}, {"review_id": "QASA5o_H9mkKMs2ReTlUqA", "user_id": "gVBbfkOrHHkRwvmzclN-Uw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "I have some serious love for sushi and Sushi Pure is high on my list of favorite sushi spots in Eugene.  It was recommended to me by a coworker so a friend and I checked it out for lunch last week.   We split two rolls, can't recall the names, but basically took two recs from our waiter.  Both were good, though the spicy one could have had a bit more punch to it.     I also had a miso soup, also good but I think there may have been just one tiny piece of tofu in it and it could have been hotter.

Usually such modern looking sushi places located in mall plaza are all show and no substance but Sushi Pure was quite the surprise. Parking was pretty easy since it was in the market area and the service was very attentive.I gotta say that when my nigiri came out with the colored rice I was definitely a bit concerned but honestly it worked just fine. It didn't have the bite I expected from multigrain rices but it did have a heavier mouthfeel. Otherwise it did still have some flavor to it. I ordered the chef's choice 12 piece nigiri and the Victoria's Secret Roll.First the Victoria's Secret roll: honestly I'd pass on it if you're not a huge roll fan. If you do prefer rolls, especially shrimp tempura ones, this is a good one to try. You don't really get to taste all the different components of it so nothing about it particularly sets it apart for me except the chef's signature sauce which I will admit is delicious. It's almost like a creamier version of the Dynamite sauce. I would eat that stuff on top of rice!The nigiri set was absolutely delicious. I would still prefer regular sushi rice, less rice, and thinner slices of fish but the fish itself was extremely fresh and flavorful in all the right ways. I also really wish that out of 12 pieces they gave you more variety. Mine came with your run of the mill stuff: 2 salmon, 2 tuna, 2 escolar, 2 albacore, 1 ebi, 1 tai, 1 saba. For the price I really did hope for a bit more variety in the selection. But in the end the fish quality was just flat out good with the exception of the saba which was tough.Overall Sushi Pure was a delightful experience! I'm glad my friend convinced me to give this place a shot!"}, {"review_id": "XnnevGiPFGPecnEyys3scQ", "user_id": "GdTihLAEvgr8-xIMzL4tpg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Ambiance is decent.
