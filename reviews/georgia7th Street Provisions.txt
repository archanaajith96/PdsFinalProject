In this aspect, it almost seems as though you are in the garden district of New Orleans with the bungalow houses and big porches. The decor inside is done very well, with the restaurant being divided in two by a huge communal dining table that would be great for a group outing! On to the food, we started with the puff pulled pork pastries which came out very quick and were incredibly tasty. As mentioned by previous reviewers, the entrees are built from the 'ground up' thus, ordering an app is imperative for the hungry patron, along with ordering the entrees before drinks to give some time for the chefs to prepare. Went with two bourbon pours while we waited for our Lamb and Salmon. Lamb shank was to die for! Served over a bed of mash with some squash accompanied on the side. The salmon was equally incredible, really enjoyed the way they served it with the bacon corn medley and lobster étouffée mixture. We were feeling pretty hungry while ordering and decided to go with a 3rd entree, the veggie ratatouille and kale action, which served as a great balance to the meat and fish! Finished the meal with the ice cream plate sampler, highly recommend! Will be back regularly!"}, {"review_id": "3TDoHNojIZKI8plk07GhjQ", "user_id": "r9zpv3142jBp9bcQo_L7Pw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "We went to this place for my best friends 30th birthday dinner. First I will say it is a very cute place, nice and cozy. Now the bad! 1. Parking is not that great and there aren't many street lights in the area to help.2. Service is extremely slow! We waited a hour and half for our entrees, for 10 people. The other table beside us was waiting as well, they got so frustrated they asked to speak with the manger. Considering we called ahead to reserve this is unacceptable. 3. The food was not great, the steak lack flavor. I had to use a steak sauce which is something I don't use if the steak is up to par. Our food was room temperature. There was no apology from management.  4. This is what did it for me! As mentioned earlier it was a birthday celebration. Usually when there is a birthday, you have cake. In this case Cupcakes! The cupcakes were decorated with bottles of small pink liquor. After singing happy birthday the waitress came over and advised us we could not consume the outside liquor in the restaurant. Great! I completely understand we had no intention of doing so, they were merely decorative. After saying that she then came back 2 minutes later with a brown paper bag, grabbing the small bottles (6) and advising my boss wants these off the table, she does not allow outside bottles. NOW! this is too much, like really it is not that serious. First have some respect, anyone in their right mind can see they were the same color as the cupcakes and used for decoration. I will not be going back to this place, the service, the horrible food, and the lack of respect was too much for me. I don't recommend."}, {"review_id": "4HezLAey8OnHcldnLiKhHw", "user_id": "yOXtenkzRitaT01DqS4wtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Elegant.

In more ways then one. This place is what I call fabulous! As a simple farm girl from upstate NY who now travels around the great USA for a living this place I could not get enough of!!!  The soft simple atmosphere to the friendly smiling faces to the AMAZING food! This place should be on your list!!! Off from the main hustle and bustle in its own cute little area, this place is a GEM! I am a flavor person and was not disappointed at all!!! I had the porkchop that was paired with amazing creamy grits, peaches and Brussel sprouts! Talk about a party in your mouth!!!

We've been let down by something nearly every date night (we suit up once a month and get all fancy for each other since we're pretty casual people) but 7th Street Provisions is the exception. Service was friendly, fast but not intrusive. Craft cocktails were good and they had a decent craft beer list (rare to find unless you go to Nonic). The food was heavenly! I recommend the mushroom turnovers for a starter. Rich creamy mushroom filing that went perfectly with the light flaky pastry dough and the sauce perfectly complimented everything else. For our entrees we always get two things and share and there wasn't really a favorite as they were both so good! We ordered the Cornish hen and I ordered the lamb shank - both cooked to perfection with seasoning and sides that all complimented each other perfectly. The dessert menu looked amazing but we were absolutely stuffed. The check for two cocktails, two craft beers, an app and two entrees really wasn't bad either. We've paid twice as much in columbus for mediocre food and service. This is a must go to in Columbus."}, {"review_id": "eeOA17M_Nw7vLwvX3YwxyA", "user_id": "hrdOdQJcgMvOp37usC1wlg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "My new favorite restaurant in Columbus.

We had the pulled pork perfiteroiles and the trifle....both were very well balanced. The pork had great flavor and could be a small meal in itself.  The trifle was just amazing. My husband and I split it, but it was so well balance and light I definitely could have had it All to myself. According to our server all food is house made, and it shows. Although we didn't have any entrees what we had was so good, we are already looking forward to our next date to see what other dishes we can try. The service was friendly, inviting and the ambiance was lovely. Great place for a date night.

I had the chicken liver pate, which was sweet and it came with several pickled items to balance the sweetness (mustard also on the plate). My main dish was the steak, also heavy on mustard but good. I would not recommend if you do not enjoy stone ground mustard. I do so all was well. When I came out of the restaurant, a homeless man asked me for my food and money. I gave him my leftovers and sadly, he threw it away as soon as I walked away. The restaurant is tucked away in the historic district where there is a hodge podge of historic buildings/homes to not so nice areas. I did not see parking and had to park on the street. I would recommend."}, {"review_id": "FhfUvoiojtQVKTcDt4biCg", "user_id": "PdS9wBLf6FyhDEQh3j0Bnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Very cool spot that is off the beaten path in downtown Columbus.

They were surprisingly busy for a Thursday evening but the charming waitress handles the challenge very well. She was most personable and gave us excellent service.The food was excellent and prepared to order so the wait time is about 30 minutes, in the interim we split a house salad. The cherry vinaigrette is to die for. I had the salmon and my wife had the steak Diane. Both entree's were outstanding.This is truly a gem among restaurants in Columbus and deserves a 5 fork rating."}, {"review_id": "InMAcaoEZGJMu1WEHCyOcA", "user_id": "HE9DfC1T9Onu_eXWtvnBcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Awesome dinner, dessert and homemade, unique cocktails.

I personally think this is the best restaurant we have had in Columbus.... in fact it ranks up with all we have had in any state.

We shared the Gouda foundue which was delicious, we highly recommend it. I got the pork chop and my husband got the salmon. The apple and sweet potato was perfect with the pork chop and my husband loved his salmon. For dessert I got the profiteroles but got pecan ice cream instead of brie. I do wish there we better options for dessert but it was still good. I highly recommend the 75 du jour cocktail but get vodka instead of gin. It was the perfect light cocktail.

If you love pate, get the 7th Street Boiler Plate. One of the best pate we've ever had. The Blackened Salmon was delicious and perfectly cooked. We requested the lightest cook that would still be blacked, and that's exactly how it came out. The only drawback is the dish would've been even better without the bacon. The Spaghetti Squash Ragout was healthy, tasty, and fun to eat. Every bite was a treat with flavorful ratatouille and fried kale. Our server, Josh, was attentive and pleasant.
