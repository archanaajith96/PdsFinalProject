Indescribable, but I'll try. It was both sweet, savory, and had a perfect amount of umami flavor. The one gripe was the beef slices was some of the toughest I've ever had.Ok, so let me say I've been around the block with pho. Short of actually having gone to Vietnam, I'd like to say I have good discernment when it comes to pho, and this place may legitimately have the best pho I've ever had the pleasure of eating. I stopped by here Sunday for lunch on a road trip through town, given that we didn't want to spend too much time on lunch, the line out the door was a bit discouraging. The place inside is small, with 2 parties in front of us, we waited about 15 min.I got the pho with thinly sliced beef and substituted egg noodles. Let's start with the slightly disappointing, the beef was pretty chewy. It was very thin and was a tougher cut of meat. Felt like I was eating a scrubbing pad tbh. This is def one of the areas they could improve. The eggs noodle were spot on, perfectly chewy and fresh. Another small gripe was that they charged extra for the egg noodles. I've never seen anyone do that, and I didn't see nor was I told there would be an upcharge. Felt decieved there. Now on to the freaking star of the show! The broth, omg this broth. It was so perfect it didn't need any hoison sauce. This broth had this indescribable sweet umami flavor that felt like it was quenching your thirst every time you drank it and your mouth was instantly craving more as soon as you were done. I felt like a man wandering the desert for a month who finally reached a drinking fountain for the first time. It was perfectly balanced, light, savory, ever so sweet, and satisfying. It was also smooth almost buttery as if they had used beef marrow in it. Each sip had a mass of flavors that were so distinct yet indescribable all the same."}, {"review_id": "mg5u-Rys7alpkPcXYwkeFA", "user_id": "gNkmQPOhOQA5dAu6a9EwgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "My wife and I went on a crusade to try as many of our bookmarked restaurants in KC as we could in one night. So, we stopped here for our appetizer, somewhere else for our main dish, and again somewhere else for dessert. This place is legit. In a grand total of 4 minutes we had ordered our to-go egg rolls & spring rolls, had them in our hand, and were walking out the door with our delicious food. I was impressed at the speed they operated.This place almost foiled our plans for the night because everything looked so good my wife and I heavily considered staying for dinner as well. Alas, we stuck with the plan but we will be back soon for a more formal introduction!Their egg rolls were so good. Imagine a warm, crispy & juicy bite into an egg roll so rich in flavor - my mouth is watering right now thinking about them. Two for $3 = Great deal. The spring rolls, when compared to the egg rolls were inferior. Compared to other spring rolls I've had they were average. I didn't love or hate them. The peanut sauce that comes with them is good.This place is extremely affordable and offers large portions from what I observed. We can't wait to go back."}, {"review_id": "JM4VitVDwNA_YYBo2O3C7g", "user_id": "MidqyIP2_vozrgEjDKrO0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I been coming here over the years for their shrimp rolls and rice dishes. I like coming here because of the cheap prices for good Vietnamese food. The location is near The River City Market off the corner of Campbell st and E Missouri Ave. The service here is pretty quick, depending on the times you come. You usually have multiple servers helping you. It can get really busy here around the peak times of lunch (11am-1pm) or dinner (6pm-8pm) especially on the weekends. This time, I ordered the canned iced coffee with the Shrimp roll appetizer and Charboiled Pork entree. The shrimp rolls comes with 6 rolls which is what I love because it really fills you up. The Charboiled Pork came with egg loaf, fried egg, and pork skin with steamed rice and a side of pho broth soup. It was so delicious!! I would definitely come back here. According to Trip Advisor, Vietnam Cafe is known as the top 10 best restaurants in Kansas City, MO. I would highly recommend this place if you like Vietnamese cuisine."}, {"review_id": "T1fYcMAuaPkrxEO9kmhhbA", "user_id": "lPNxg0oIDnQ4fRMQScgT2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The place is packed, can't count the different ethnic groups, my kind of place!!!

The staff is friendly, the service is quick and the food we had was delicious! My husband and I only had time to try their Spring Rolls and Eggrolls, and we throughly enjoyed them. Obviously the Eggrolls were our fav because fried food always tastes better, but the peanut dipping sauce with the Spring Rolls was A+. We will definitely be back to sample the rest of their menu!"}, {"review_id": "VWlYHpaEYuo60EKiqgm_sg", "user_id": "j2sNN6zx9qGqoB1qeRNERw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "We came down here for lunch on Saturday at the recommendation of a friend, and because the boyfriend was craving Pho (when is he not). The first couple of things that we noticed when walking in was that the place was packed. There weren't any tables, and waitstaff was busily flitting around taking/delivering orders, and clearing/cleaning tables. We also noticed that they have lots of awards donning their walls, so we were definitely excited to try some of their food.There isn't a hostess to greet you when you arrive, nor a structured line to figure out which group arrived first, so they operate on an honor system when they ask you who's next in line for a table. There were menus near the door, and one of the waitstaff encouraged us to take a look and figure out what we wanted to order while waiting for a table. They definitely appreciate it if you know what you want as soon as you're seated at a table on a busy day. Although there was one couple ahead of us in line, we did not have to wait long. As soon as we were seated, we were immediately given waters, and was asked if we were ready to order. My boyfriend got the Pho Dac Biet and I got the Hu Tieu Do Bien. Both were really delicious and the pho came with an platter of bean sprouts, cilantro, jalapenos, thai basil, and lime to garnish your bowl. The bowls were also really huge, considering the low price point, and by the time the two of us finished, we were stuffed. My boyfriend couldn't even finish all of his broth, despite usually cleaning out his bowl. When you finish, you go up to the front counter to pay, and you just point out where your table was, since the tables aren't numbered. By going up to pay instead of waiting for someone to bring the check to you, they definitely speed up the process of getting customers in and out. This is definitely one of the most affordable pho places I've been to so far in Kansas City, especially considering how much food you get, so the two of us will be sure to come back."}, {"review_id": "rA3CqoY6T426ms4lh8CzpQ", "user_id": "FlEbL_nsiGzaK620Sv6zsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "We came here for pho and hieu tieu.

Would give it more stars if I could.The foods, needless to say, are the best in Kansas City. I tried various Vietnamese restaurants there and Vietnam Cafe is different from all of them. I got Bun Mang Vit which is vermicelli with duck and bamboo, Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Noodles), Nem nuong, and Ca phe sua da (Iced coffee). The broth in Duck soup is flavorful and it comes with fresh herbs. Bun Bo Hue came in big portion and it was not too spicy. My boyfriend loves the nem nuong, which is grilled marinated ground pork.  I would say the foods here taste the same with what I can get back in Vietnam. The service is fast and the price is reasonable. I would totally eat here for every meals if I live in Kansas city."}, {"review_id": "spWZTpKnIHBDbyOozfoiIQ", "user_id": "62t-bPD25lY--mLXaLQslw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/24/2017", "text": "Disclaimer: All too recently I learned that it was pronounced \"fuh\" and not \"fō\", so take my review with a grain of salt if you think that makes me an idiot.But the food was great! I got the pho bo and it's probably the best pho I've had. Although the restaurant was really crowded, service was really fast and I enjoyed every last drop of my enormous bowl of pho. I was only stopping in for a quick lunch and didn't try anything else on the menu, but I'll certainly be back.If you want some pho (or if you've never had it and are curious), I'd highly recommend stopping by--I know I will!I'll end this review with an excerpt from a conversation with a Vietnamese friend of mine:\"I just went to Vietnam Cafe--my life will never be the same. Soooo good\"- It's okay.\"Only okay? Then where's good, I need to try *that*\"- Nowhere in KC.

They'll take your order while you wait in line so the food typically hits your table within minutes of getting your seat.

We had amazing sweet potato fries to start off and then each got different pho. They were all amazing and paired perfectly with the snow/ice outside.

Boyfriend and I were looking for something outside of BBQ in KC. We visited KC on a rainy weekend and was craving something soupy at that moment. We came right before the lunch rush and watched as people constantly came rolling in at the door. I can see why Vietnam Cafe is a popular lunch spot. The location of Vietnam Cafe is pretty hidden, and interior looks like any other Asian restaurants, but food is delicious for the price! We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees for less than $25! My recommendations1. Order A4. Bahn Tom Chien (Shrimp and Sweet Potato Fries) instead of the usual A2. Goi Cuon (Spring rolls)2. The pho beef broth is legit! The broth is very savory and has a lot of depth to the flavor. 3. The Ga Cary (Chicken curry) is a nice alternative for $7. I eat pho pretty often back at home, but I could see myself eating at Vietnam Cafe almost everyday. Thank VC for the awesome last meal before our drive back! We will definitely come back not only for the KC BBQ but for a bowl of pho on our next visit!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/vietnam-cafe-kansas-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
