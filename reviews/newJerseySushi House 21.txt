Came here on a Friday night and we were blown away. The sushi here is so good and fresh. Service is great and the decor is very presentable. I almost wish they had a liquor license, but I guess one cannot have it all. Overall our experience here was great. Will definitely comeback."}, {"review_id": "k1cHDzY-LnjlKavPlR6Ccw", "user_id": "hFJgRL0m1i1XFXVu7YxGTw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Very small place with like 5 tables and they don't seem to let u sit at the sushi bar.  I asked the waitress if they had any off the menu fish, and she gave me a blank stare.  She finally said no, but who knows if she really understood me.For dinner, I ordered the Chirashi which comes with 12 pc of sashimi.  I received 1 shrimp, 1 imitation crab, 2 white tuna, 3 tuna, 2 salmon, 2 tamago, and 2 striped bass.  Overall, the fish was fairly fresh, but I would have only chosen 1 or 2 of those type if I was going to order a la carte; therefore, I didn't feel like it was anything special.  Who really wants tamago and imitation crab on their chirashi anyway?I was wanting to add a cold appetizer after finishing the chirashi, but my waitress was being unattentive, so when I finally got her attn, I just decided to get a quick dessert and leave.  I had the fried cheesecake that comes with a scoop of green tea ice cream.  It was decent with a nice presentation.   The cheesecake is purchased and frozen, they bread it in the kitchen and flash fry it.  The only bad part about a frozen cheesecake is the center is still frozen.  So I couldn't put my fork into the cake to cut it after taking a couple of bites.Overall, I feel like this was just okay and was more casual type of place.  If you've had great quality sushi with less common fish being brought in, this place pales in comparison."}, {"review_id": "nLYvKlfQJv8DpaDyMzEemQ", "user_id": "PSoR7GHaiS-PetlFeJrJtg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "The happy hour offer is very good but the atmosphere of the restaurant is not up to standard I think in the past , there is another chef Called Neilson who worked here but have moved to another restaurant"}, {"review_id": "O2tzRi83E-zI5wc_LHXdlg", "user_id": "ljhkIEt8oYkQQ8JyZl59yA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Overall very good product and fresh sushi at a fair price.

The family that runs this place is kind. The food tastes fresh and yummy. The menu offering is both a little more than what you'd hope to expect but also provides all of the comfortable favorites I've come to love. Great prices with generous discounts depending on day/time. The happy hour special is fantastic for $20 and feeds two adults. In Manhattan, I might pay $10 for one special roll or maaaaybe 2 less-exciting rolls. But with this deal, you get 2.5 rolls for $10 (you need to order 5 rolls for the $20 special... just breaking it down as an example if you shared with a friend.)If I had to say one thing that stands out above all others at Sushi House 21... is the attention to detail. Take for instance, the miso soup. Normally you are #campmiso or #campsalad. It's the same level of miso soup expectation at most all small family run japanese asian fusion joints run by families of various asian ethnicities. Side note: I happen to think this family may be Chinese but I haven't asked and frankly, it's none of my business. but they seem so kind and sweet that if I had the courage to start practicing my Mandarin, I bet they would humor me and chat for a while... it's that kind of friendly family neighborhood feel. Ok... so back to soup. Right. Miso soup usually skews towards deliciously uninspiring. HOWEVER. Their miso soup is anything but bland. I'm not quite sure how to explain it... it's not knock-your-socks-off-eat-me-now delicious but it's also well above \"average\" and comes with the cutest lil mushroom yums. Each and every time, consistent, reliable, slurpable.All of this stuff is great news and totally meets my standard for \"get what you expect\" and \"good eats\" but what REALLY adds the cherry on top... the beautiful paintings. Inside, outside, all over... the artwork is so attention grabbing, so interesting, so well done... this level of care for the ambiance and the overall dining experience just reinforces the unexpected and enjoyable attention to detail.Finding a small family business like this... in a neighborhood that tends to skew away from eating out & towards South American cuisine... is such a welcomed treasure. Check this place out, make the trek from your job, your home, whatever... help keep them in business for years to come. In fact, they have an adorable 2 yr old daughter so we definitely want this family restaurant to not just survive, but thrive!"}, {"review_id": "gpwiY76wuznPyW7ylpKrRw", "user_id": "SZyntzLOMdw83UJVqZ1Ssg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "When you have a favorite sushi spot you always expect less from other places.

My party of 5 came on a saturday night at about 9:30pm. We waited for 15 minutes before we were seated, given another 10 minutes to look at the menu, and then we finally ordered. Food came out after 20 minutes, but my dish took much longer. When everyone was almost finished with their food, THEN my order finally came. The restaurant was pretty busy and there was only one waitress serving and taking orders. The decor of the restaurant is quirky and fits the neighborhood!

I do not know if we were hungry or what - but GAWT DERN if that was not one of the best sushi meals I have had in a long time. and the PRICES!?!?!? BEYOND reasonable. Especially for such fresh and quality food. The service was great, love the interior (not frilly, but thoughtful), the portions were filling, the price was on point. I love everything about life because of that lunch. The guy ordered a sashimi plate of some sort. Not sure what it is called, but he was in heaven! SO much fish. He loved it all but the octopus. (We love octopus) but he said it did not takes the way we are used to it tasting. Other than that...The presentation, amount of fish.. everything...

Can't wait to come backAtmosphere: Small and neat. Came in around 6pm on a Tuesday and there was only one other party, but it started picking up around 7Food: Whenever I see duck on a menu I go bizzerk. Duck confit and risotto. Alas, I also read how great the sushi was so I had to try a spicy tuna hand roll. The hand roll came out first, and my oh my is this fish FRESH. Sadly, the tuna wasn't as spicy as I had liked (it actually wasn't spicy at all), but regardless it was tasty and all of the sushi ingredients blended well. My duck confit was huge, filling, delicious, and totally worth the $16. The skin was crispy and the meat was tender, and the risotto was cooked perfectly and was bursting with flavor. I miss it now as I type.Service: Kind people own and run the place. The woman told me to come back and save room for dessert the next time.
