Got vegetarian egg rolls (3). Very rapid response from wait staff. Excellent taste and ingredients on the egg rolls. The sweet and sour was bright red but very tasty. I got the cashew nut with tofu. I asked for medium so the waitress said you want a good burn then. I said no let's go with mild. Their mild is what I am used to with medium and perfect. The taste of the cashew not was wonderful. Lots of onions and other Veges. The tofu was really good. Well done. Almost like seitan. The portion size was perfect. This is an excellent restaurant for vegetarians. Great thai."}, {"review_id": "KtgvHrrOZ_OHhn4lXJ3NDg", "user_id": "WNgutVCGaW9I3C5IbScO-g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "It was just okay...What i appreciate about this restaurant is the service and the atmosphere. Our waitress took good care of us. Our water glasses never went empty. I would say this is a great place to have food with your family. I just wish the food was better. Let's just say i know my way around Thai food. Seriously. Unfortunately, this place was just okay. The Laab we got was overly salty. I had to re-season it to make it more balanced. The pad thai woonsen was acceptable. Not bad but not something I have to have again and again. Verdict: I probably won't be back. BUT Give it a go if you like your food on the saltier side. Avoid the Laab."}, {"review_id": "9wYpINB-kiJsvLNefNvWVA", "user_id": "GAqyUlt62fEizQv11kY2Yw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "I give 5 on food as both dishes (Pad Gapow Chicken extra spicy and Pad See Ew chicken mild) were excellent examples of these dishes.    The soup and salad are a pass but I do not eat thai a least once a week for the soup of salad They have thai beers - try Chang if you haven't yet - and an excellent menu.  A bit pricy for lunch but the place was full and there is no shortage of wonderful things to say about the food and speed here.

Their thai hot is to my liking and burns SO good, oh yeah! I went with 1 other during Friday lunch and we didnt have to wait (depite being busy) which was awesome. Service was nice and the food came out fast. During lunch, you get a soup or salad with your meal. For my meal, I got drunken noodles, thai hot with beef and my friend got the popular Phad Thai noodles, mild with chicken/tofu. I would say pretty large size lunch and those 2 were about $13 each..including tip so not bad!

It was pretty good. The atmosphere inside and serving dishes make it look a little more fancy than it is, which is good every day Thai cuisine. I tasted my friend's curries and Tom Yum and they were tasty, but nothing to go crazy over. I had the Larb, at the Thai spicy level. Having been to Thailand, I know what Thai spicy is, but never get that type of heat whenever a restaurant in the states says \"Thai spicy.\" So, without tasting (which is a no no), I put extra chili's they offered on the side right on my dish. The extra chili offering is really good to, which includes the pepper-infused fish sauce. Needless to say, it was the spiciest Thai food I've had in the states. No joke."}, {"review_id": "VOED-AdU3b3XLNFgfkkNMg", "user_id": "Kr4pen7h6IHG19eQzeWVrQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "Portion size is a bit too small in my opinion.

I'm not the biggest fan of thai restaurants but I\"m trying more and more. This place was super busy during lunch, so if you have a short lunch period this would probably not be your place. We started off withTiger Cry Beef: It was just okay, beef flavor was good, but you don't get your money's worth. I could do without this one.Spring Roll Deluxe: 2 spring rolls and 2 egg rolls. The spring rolls were good but the egg rolls weren't. It was fine, but not delicious Thai Basil Wings: The sauce was awesome! I want to try the ribsWe also had:Crab Fried Rice: Yes, there is real crab in this dish, the flavor was great, I'm sure all the other fried rice dishes are good too!Pad Sa Eww: This was delicious, you got that seasoned/charred wok taste to the noodles and the flavors were great.Pa Grapow: We got this with pork, it's a basil stir fry ground pork with peppers.

I'm all about the food when it comes to reviewing Thai because I know the trendy spots aren't always the best, and the hidden ones tend to shine.The food here was pretty good, service was nice and the company I had for lunch was great. I would definitely consider coming back to explore more of the menu, but there were a few key things missing that kept it from being a place I can rave about.I tried a noodle dish from the server's recommendation and it was good, if not a bit plain. The noodles were prepackaged and the way they add spice was by adding giant, bright green jalapenos (mixed in with equally bright green bell peppers!). To me, it's better when a ground up curry paste mixes in spice, or when there's an oil or spice blend to liven up a dish, but straight jalapenos just made for uneven mild bites followed by painfully hot bites.I want to give the curries a try on the next trip in because those are my true measuring stick, but with my fav Thai joint right down the road, it's going to be tough for me to make it back in. All in all a good enough spot but not one that I'm likely to remember."}, {"review_id": "8jlwynvDEuxy8UQwUeseXA", "user_id": "PdrNBNgSgwKJBzLGWcVGww", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Parking is really small which kinda sucks. The pad thai and crab fried rice we got was pretty good but everything else was not good compared to Koko Thai. We had the crying tiger beef for appetizers and it was pretty disappointing to me. It might have been alright but when I compare it to Koko Thai it was not very good. The Siam chicken was yoo gingery too. If you are craving Thai food I would definitely recommend Koko Thai in the downtown area. If you are just craving pad thai this place is sufficient. Koko Thai let's you add extra chicken to the pad thai which is nice.  this place doesn't give you much protein and I'm not sure if you can add extra on or not. In my opinion Koko Thai is superior in every way. My review is strictly on the food only! Kokothai is kinda small and can sometimes feel yoo packed but the food is definitely worth it!"}, {"review_id": "rQWbqGWHYASfbKcflzmFOw", "user_id": "cxbNoom5vXFvQZKHKtE_Dg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/13/2017", "text": "My coworkers think this is the best place ever, I on the other hand do not. It's a-ok for a lunchtime meal with co-workers, try to get there early if you need a larger table. They do not take reservations for lunch, even with a large table. They can make at least one of their curries gluten free, the red curry. Their lunch special comes with salad or soup and cost around $10. I usually get the red curry with a salad and tofu. I don't get any spice with my curry but for some reason it still makes my nose run and my eyes water. My other coworkers get the hot and seem okay! I am typically ok with spicy food but for some reason this place gets me. Nothing stands out, service is okay. Parking is difficult, you have to go to one of the side lots.

That being said I was not impressed with the service- the waitress was rude that night and kept saying no to questions like \"do you have lime and chili paste?\" Pretty surprising that the restaurant didn't have either one of these as most tend to.

Start with a Thai tea and order some Thai wings. Fried crispy with basil, this is my favorite appetizer ever. The curries are great here, as are the soups, the stir fry, and any noodle dish.
