That's how much I love this place. I literally have tried everything on the menu. Yet I just keep coming back. The three items that I ordered this time are my top 3. Promise me you'll order them, or else you will miss out on the most beautiful flavors. We started with the bone marrow. This dish was simplicity at its best. You can just spread the marrow on the toasted bread like butter. The capers on the top perfectly balanced out the fatty and greasy marrow. All of these ingredients made a wonderful food melody. One bite, and I was in heaven. We were then served with the grilled octopus. As I've said multiple times -- I'm a huge octopus fan. This dish is for sure among the best octopus I've had. The octopus was grilled to form a crispy crust, while the inner part was still tender. The sauce also elevated the flavor, adding a touch of freshness to the dish. Last but certainly not least, we had the grilled broccoli. This dish could even make a hater love broccoli. It's that GOOD. I didn't even feel like I was eating vegetables. Can you believe that we finished off this dish first? HahahaI don't want to be grumpy... but there are just too many people lol. Every time I go there, I have to wait for at least an hour. It's such a torture smelling the amazing food coming out of the kitchen."}, {"review_id": "Qk-Dd6ruTLkYQKKZvohb4w", "user_id": "t48rb-qq3qc93Pxeux2Yjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I was super excited to try The Purple Pig for lunch and I was mostly impressed! I got to the restaurant about 10 minutes before they opened to ensure that I would get seated.The Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad and Sicilian Sea Salt was delicious without being too greasy. The large bone was served with several pieces of thick crunchy bread, some greens, and sea salt. A spoonful of that bone marrow with that bread, and I was in heaven! We were basically fighting over the last pieces of that bone marrow!The Fava Bean Spread was pretty average. A few pieces of bread with some spread, which basically tasted like hummus. I would not get again.Crispy Pig's Ears wasn't my favorite dish. I thought the entire dish was too greasy, but I did enjoy the blend of veggies (kale and peppers), along with the perfectly fried runny egg. I would not get again.The Grilled Octopus came with Fingerling Potatoes, Green Beans and Salsa Verde. The octopus was super tender and perfectly cooked, though the entire dish was too salty. All of the individual components were salty, as was the Salsa Verde, which made everything too salty.The Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes and Puffed Farro was absolutely incredible! The meat was so tender and basically fell apart in my mouth. As a lover of mashed potatoes, I was happy that these were creamy and not lumpy.I'm generally not a big fan of desserts but knew I had to try the Sicilian Iris, which was a fried donut stuffed with ricotta and chocolate chips. Cutting open the dessert was glorious, and the taste matched the appearance just as well. I loved how creamy the filling was without being too sweet.Purple Pig is so close to 5 stars for me, but some of the dishes were just too salty and oily for my liking. I would definitely come back for the Pork Shoulder and Bone Marrow!"}, {"review_id": "i5_lWJpU9J1G_buYuVio7w", "user_id": "4CkIGvzYPUGacw1gn9BBDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I was so excited to try the Purple Pig and I had such a good time here. I sat at the bar and the servers were on top of everything. I had a meat and cheese board to start with duck prosciutto, chorizo and prosciutto and a Brie cheese. The duck and chorizo were delicious but I'd skip the regular prosciutto next time and try a different meat. The Brie was delicious and perfect for spreading and I really enjoy the fruit spread that came with it.For the main course, I had the chicken thigh kebabs with tzatziki sauce and fried potatoes. It was amazingly good - definitely a big portion but it was so yummy that I finished it all.Would highly recommend coming here if you get the chance!"}, {"review_id": "HrgGs7fJJjN-BatRNGq6-w", "user_id": "cyYBOrz49VBTWwusP0J6_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Absolutely outstanding food here.The salt-roasted beets is a perfect starter.

My friend and I came here on a Saturday at around 530pm and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table of two. To be perfectly honest, it was a short wait compared to what I've heard from others and larger table (a table of 7 before us was given an estimated time of 2 hours with a minimum $100 spend per person). I put my name and number down and they sent me a text to  confirm and I was able to walk around shops during the waiting time.For a party of two, we ordered 3 dishes and shared. The servers recommended 2 dishes per person, however since we aren't huge eaters we decided on 3. We ordered the bone marrow, octopus, and pork shoulder. This was my first time trying bone marrow and I was not expecting it and did not enjoy it as much as others might've. The octopus was my favourite at around $20 a plate. It wasn't an overly large plate, but it was quite delicious. It has a mix of veggies and sauce and had a good char to it. The shoulder was tender and very soft, but to pair it with mashed potatoes on the bottom seemed like a scoop of mush.I expecting this dinner to be over the moon, but it honestly didn't quite make it there. I wouldn't come back if the line was over 30 minutes long!"}, {"review_id": "_RL1iNA4nF2LpdsEosgQlw", "user_id": "uZbIzVlYLu8Etg8wUXyRlQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Excellent gastro-pub type set up offering very innovative and delicious cuisine in small plates that are very affordable. We got here early and even then, at 5PM, the place was nearly full. We managed to score a high top with four seats free in the communal section and began ordering drinks and snacks. The Star Wars fan in me made the Rebel Scum cocktail and no-brainer to start with. It was an excellent combination of Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Borghetti Espresso Liqueur, demerara and Bertagnolli Grappa di Amarone. We later moved on to the Colombian Old Fashioned  which was 13 Parce 8 Year Rum, Cruzan Black Strap Rum and Amaro d'Arancia with Demerara. One of my top 5 cocktails of all time. I think I could have had 10 (I think I may have).For our shared plates we did the house made n'duja (don't miss it), octopus with potatoes and salsa verde, deviled eggs, pork belly and Huevos Rotos con Chorizo which were amazing.Service was attentive and helpful, making suggestions and offering some ordering tips. The setting was comfortable without being stuff and the prices, for the quality of innovative food we received, were great."}, {"review_id": "ZT4mv7xrzp4XW7r3mm5SJQ", "user_id": "0MvhBWSBhdnBaw3N56OT8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Yum yum yum! We ordered the ribeye, blaze steak, and turkey leg and all three were insanely amazing. This place was packed when we went around 4pm on a Saturday, but we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes which was great. Communal style seating, which is cool. However, the seat I sat at, which is not designed great at all - high table near the window, three of us were at the end of the table. This meant every time someone that was sitting in the inner seats had to get up, I had to stand up to let them out because there wasn't enough space behind the table. (4x I had to do this and this is why I subtracted 1 Star) It's very loud in the restaurant as well FYI. The service was wonderful! Overall, I would go back here as I definitely want to try more on the menu, but I will definitely opt to sit in another seat."}, {"review_id": "n92ojOyTvZEVodnLj1kdAw", "user_id": "6msAhk2pJU9snlI0ZH-rtQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "First time in Chicago and wanted some local favorites.  We had ribeye cap (black garlic, wild rice, eggplant, braised pine nuts, pomegranate) and red snapper (purple jam, mushrooms, and spanish apple) both were delicious.

Apparently the wait here is notorious for being, on average, 1-2 hrs long. No reservations taken. But on both attempts that I've visited, I've either been able to sit right away (for 2) on a Saturday night at 5pm, or like last night, was told it would be a 1.5hr wait and ended up being 15mins (for 3) at 7pm on a weekday. Seating ranges from private tables to communal to barside and standing room only. Theme is Mediterranean tapas but some of the seafood, pork and beef dishes are full-sized entrees. Price points are more than fair and reasonable for the quality. Perfect location to impress a date or friends visiting from out of town.Ordered the Buttersquash Empanadas (black truffle oil, squash, cheese filling with apple sauce demiglaze and the cutest melted marshmallow pillow on a cinnamon stick), Pork Ossabuco, Red Snapper on red cabbage sauce, Octopus with potatoes and asparagus, and a Fried Hash & Chorizo dish I cannot remember the name of.Aside from that last dish, I would order any of the dishes again. Food comes out promptly in no particular order (per host) and piping hot. I broke my pescetarian fast and had some of the Ossabuco - it was heavenly! The meat pulled off the bone so easily and the goblets of fat melted in your mouth. It was generously doused with tomato and polenta sauces. The Octopus was one of the best dishes I've ever had. Extemely tender and meaty inside but nicely charred on the outside. Red snapper was fresh, nicely charred and delish with a red cabbage sauce that was tart and sweet at the same time (looked and tasted akin to poi, lol). The Empanadas were also yummy, just consider this a dessert rather than an appetizer. It was fun to eye all the orders next to my party bc every dish looked amazing. Only regret was not being able to try the dessert menu bc I was stuffed. Aside: I rarely comment on the service of an eatery bc it's about the food, not having my ego stroked. However I would like to say that it was my last meal in town, and I had brought my luggage bag with me. The host was kind enough to store the bag in a discrete corner during my meal. However, the manager/person walking the floors in glasses and of Indian or middle eastern descent took one look at my bag in that corner, sneered and asked what it was doing there. Host said it was a luggage piece, manager sneered again and said \"I know, what's that doing there?\" And I was right in front of him the whole time. Way to make me feel low and ashamed of being a tourist trying to squeeze in a last good meal before heading to the airport. He was rude and \"acted like he owned the joint.\" The good food and company of my party washed away that horrid encounter  early on in the night."}, {"review_id": "7k1AqG6Mkaq50JYuHWNAAA", "user_id": "Vxvz1EXuOyDQ30S-nv2npA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Got the pork steak, the octopus, and the grilled broccoli.

I understand that in the downtown of Chicago, there will always be a long line for a seat and a packed seating arrangement in the restaurant ... but the two of us were uncomfortably squished side by side on a long table with many other groups ... (I mean we still LOVED the food and the waiter was awesome!) We had about a 1.5hour wait, but we quickly spent that in the shopping mall down the road! They're also so kind to text and call you to let you know that the table is ready! After the text they give you ten minutes to get back to the restaurant! So don't wonder off too far!We got: 1. (On their Specials menu) Avocado Crab Salad (?) (Avocado Tempura | Crab Salad & Radish, and some other goodness that I don't remember the names of  - it was so refreshing to start with!)2. Crispy Pig's Ears (Worth a try! But you really can't tell if they're pig's ears texture and taste wise but the pork fat definitely shines through the taste! Still a super tasty dish!)3. Roasted Bone Marrow (Super tasty combination of the bread, bone marrow, and salad - the dish also comes with some salt that you can sprinkle on the bone marrow!)We also got a glass of white wine and a glass of red wine - both were lovely!

You are literally sharing a large table for 14 with strangers. There is good music but awfully loud. My party of 7 went down to a party of 5 where my husband and I decided to wait the 1.5 hours, since the amount of the reviews were so high. The food. The pork belly and chicharronea were great. The food was still sizzling when it arrived. The pork belly was very tender and tasteful. The vinegar gave the chicharronea a  great taste as well. They were a good size order but we still ordered a second one. We also ate the fried pizza and the spare ribs. Once you get past the balsamic sauce on the ribs, the meat was great. The balsamic was just a little too much for me. (And they were cold). The pizza got hard real fast and was ok. You have to eat it as soon as it hits your table. Our server was not great. The busser were great but we saw our waitress three times. Our water and drinks went unfilled. The busser finally heard our need for water and refilled. The table we sat at had a group of loud people. They were dusting off their crumbs towards us! Not even an \"oooops sorry\". There was also a guy who was pretty much sitting on my lap because the lack of space.

Their plates were much smaller, something you see only boujee people eating. Yup, I was proud of it! Haha. The plating was gorgeous and the food was interestingly different and yummy. Be mindful coming in... the way they designed the place is totally not meant for people who are claustrophobic! Seriously!! There is an outdoor tent area for you to wait but once you head through their poorly designed tented door/make-shift hallway it's chaos. My cousin and I were sat at a table where the layout of it is long and rectangular. So I was sitting next to another woman and her girlfriend.
