My friend took us a while to decide on this place but it had diverse food on the menu for all 4 of us to pick it. There was a short wait so we walked around for a bit then we got seated. It had a nice vibe and server was nice.Oysters - Yum! I was the only one who ordered it and I loved it!Ceviche - I can't remember the taste but I know we all enjoyed it. Oregano bread - we were curious why this was popular that's why we ordered it. Can't go wrong with a fresh bread!Fried chicken those greens! Yum! My friend got the fish with some kind of coconut sauce and once in a while I still think about it. Where can I have that here in SF? Great spontaneous dinner I'd definitely recommend. Oh yea gotta get some dranks! They were yummy and strong too."}, {"review_id": "rMaLDJpdFCLh9KX8pMBrDg", "user_id": "i5OS1TW_2htKyRkLSPPy_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "We went on a Wednesday in the middle of the day, and it was not too busy. The dining area was much more crowded than the bar / lounge area in back.The oregano fry bread was quite lovely (they didn't overdo the oregano), and I also had a scramble which was very tasty.The menu was pretty limited, but it was obvious they put a lot of thought into their offerings.We'll be back."}, {"review_id": "qnRXPVZOWsv41jsn06JoDQ", "user_id": "YrfZRHhLQQ_n97VlWXtVCQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "I've tried coming here before but the wait has always been long. Surprisingly at 7pm on a Thursday evening we were able to be seated immediately. First impressions... it's loud, you almost have to yell in order for the person sitting two feet away from you hear you. Today was one of the first warm days of the year, it got up to 73 and our party all agreed it was too warm inside. To the point where I was perspiring. And now for the reason I'll never come back. You know you've made it in Portland WHEN YOU CAN CHARGE $6 FOR A LOCAL DRAFT BEER PINT! $6!!!!!!!!!!!! Just to sit in a cramped, loud, and hot space. What in the actual hell. I can buy 72 oz for $10 at the store but $6 for 16oz????? Management are greedy clowns. I wish nothing but the worst on you. $6 drafts and $12 entrees? Are you straight tarded? Food is typical bar food and nothing to get excited about. The wait staff was very attentive and did do their jobs well. However, their smile-less faces are testament to the people they work for. Avoid like the plague."}, {"review_id": "G_rg5pC2MYS_-_zZKztOXQ", "user_id": "G1DtOw86TtPYtllePlMAdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Met a friend here for lunch around 11:30. Luckily we arrived before the noon lunch rush! There are only 4 booths in the window...all other seating is 4-top tables. Very contemporary inside and comfortable. Staff is welcoming and attentive. Restaurant was clean. They also have picnic table seating outside. I ordered the Curry Chicken Salad Wrap with apples, cashews, raisins and chopped romaine. It was absolutely delicious...just the perfect amount of curry. It came with crispy fries, which were also quite tasty. They serve Portland Ketchup here as well. Love it when local businesses support one another!My friend ordered the Peppered Bacon Turkey Club. The bread, from Grand Central Bakery which I also love, was toasted with mayo, lettuce and tomato. It was very good. The turkey and bacon was plentiful. Overall I was very happy with my experience here...will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "1ws3XyqU-VfZnsf9b8DHOg", "user_id": "fHqt_c3oDQ4ZWFzeOo4ezA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Be careful of the parking, but be happy with everything else!

She loved the unique menu and our customer, who is from Portland, joined us for a casual dinner. He had never tried this spot but was optimistic. We all shared the charcuterie plate and the fry bread to start. WOW! I cannot day enough about the fry bread. Dipping it in the tomato purée is a must. Tastes like homemade pizza. What a great app and so different from traditional \"bread and butter\". I did not try the charcuterie plate but the rest of my party said the combination of flavors was excellently paired. I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich without slaw. There are two sauce options, one being a bourbon BBQ sauce and I love bourbon so that was a clear choice for me. Good service, great menu, modern atmosphere, overall totally awesome place."}, {"review_id": "LPvh-dFA_F8rKzRuarcMGQ", "user_id": "88FUpkjKJMfXkALACGddQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Although this is my first check in I have been here several times and love the place!  Service is excellent and the food is always fresh and super tasty!  They offer a wide variety of American food.  Salads are on point and the specials are ALWAYS special!  Try everything!  There is definitely something for everybody here.  Their full bar offers a good selection of beer wine and specialty cocktails."}, {"review_id": "snCbqG4CUckIZZNTqoUkpQ", "user_id": "ng0dtz--8RidYO1cDZgxjg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "We finished with the HH at Vintage Cocktails Lounge and ran over to this joint for their HH that ends at 6pm.Customer service: once we arrived at 5:18pm, we thought - oh no, we are doomed. There is a 15-20 mins wait. But never fear! For the bar seats are near! They have 4 seats open at the bar and we took 2 of the 4 seats. Score! The bartender immediately attended to us and provided us water. I ordered the daily special cocktail and it tasted like how he described it - rose water, vodka, and soda with a hint of sweetness. I ordered one and it arrived in less than 5 mins.Kichen service: we ordered ginger sake mussels, chicken pay and tomate-red pepper bisque at 5:20pm and the food arrived by 5:245m. Super fast service.Portion, price and taste: decent sized for the HH. The mussels sauces's saltiness was over powering the ginger or sake taste. The chicken pate was heavy but oh so tasty. The bisque, while cheap, it is boring. Overall: service is good, but we are  more about the food. So we may come back again to try, but some HH menu items are a hit or miss."}, {"review_id": "aMLBbikJYHJ4ZtYDUeUFfw", "user_id": "unsDeZ-0TpyX2Myk4EfWdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "I got the chicken curry wrap, and the flavors are on point.

He had the elk burger and I had the lam burger (mouth is still watering!)  with the sweet potato fries. We were there during happy hour and those options looked great, but this was our first meal of the day so hence the burgers. Drink special was a fig and thyme infused gin & tonic! Yum! Mid-century, eclectic atmosphere  was comfortable, fun and perfect for our date day. We will be back for the mussels, charcuterie style plate and to try some of their other cocktails from their full bar! Service was friendly, prompt and we were seated right away. We had the perfect balance of being checked on, but not too much and were able to leave when we were done.

The menu is awesome with a great range of appetizers if you just wanted to stick with that & drinks. The dinner menu is great too, I always get some type of fish because I don't find that at too many places in town. They also have a bar that's connected in the back where you can either grab drinks while you wait for a table or just stay there for a first come first serve table! I also think they have a super creative and yummy cocktail list!

Yelp says it is good for groups... which it kind of is, but there is a catch. You have to half have your party there to be seated. They don't take reservations so be prepared to hold a spot on your own. We went in the way back which is really cool, however the seats dont move together. The tables are near each other but they just don't move. Now, the decor here is really cool. This is a modern bar/dinner restaurant. Lighting is low, current music is playing, and an overall casual feel. If you like lamb.... GET THE LAMB BURGER. DO NOT MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY. IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD!

The interior is intimate with a rustic touch and a large bar. The bar is beautifully lit and the decor is minimalistic and elegant. The cocktails are in the 9-12 dollar range and the food also matches that price range. On Friday they serve food until 12 on the front end and 1 on the back end of the establishment. For dinner we decided on a sesame chili chicken salad and a hoagie with a jalapeño jack cheese, slaw and a side of whole grain mustard. Both were delicious and matched the price in terms of quality. This place lives up to it's reviews and is certainly worth a visit whether you're a local or just visiting."}, {"review_id": "zIowkomHfvvXxd3Dm2dPgQ", "user_id": "DHUfDrzWi0rTSel-14RLoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "About a 10 minute wait for a table for a Monday night. So you know its going to be good! If you dont want to wait you can head to the back and theres pool table and bar. They service the full menu back there also. Since we are on vacation we waited to be seated. The host and our waitress was very welcoming and friendly. The host gave us menus while we waited to maybe help expedite our visit. I didnt mind since I wanted to order everything. Menu is easy to navigate and wasn't confusing. Prices are good and no sales tax so when our bill came it was half what we would have spent for a meal in San Francisco. Heres what we ordered!The honey milk is sooo good and lightly sweet! Nice amount of rum.Fry bread is a must try! Taste sort of like tortino pizza roll crust but omg it was good, fresh, & tasty. Came with two dipping sauces.Mac and cheese was ok. Not much topping and wasn't overly cheesy. More on the bland side and little watery.Heirloom squash soup with coconut oil was on the special menu and another must try if available. Its creamy and theres a little kick!I ordered the trout and customized it with the potato pancakes and broccolini. Fish had a slight fishy smell and a little too salty but the potato pancakes smooth it out.There was a duck special which was pretty good if you like gamey meats. I love peking duck growing up so its a good dish but others might not like the texture and taste of duck. It came with squash and a side of sautéed arugula red peppers. For dessert the pear tart was beautifully put together. The vanilla ice cream paired well with it. We wanted sorbet but they were out.Overall its a spot you must check out if your in Portland. I had to knock down one star since we ordered Oysters but they were never brought out and I wanted green beans substituted for the broccolini but I was hungry and didn't bother."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-observatory-portland?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
