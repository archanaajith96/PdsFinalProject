Can our sourcing of it combat poverty and reduce child vulnerability?\"Excerpt taken from Endiro' s website. The answer is yes, yes, and yes! And they created an amazing coffee shop experience that makes me want to go back over and over again.I walked into this impeccably clean spot one afternoon and instantly fell in love. The aroma of coffee was calling me from outside. I ended up with an espresso and the avocado toast and wasn't disappointed. I can't wait to come back in the future. I am so happy Aurora has this gem!"}, {"review_id": "Q7PyG9R-aZ5E2SimkU1TzA", "user_id": "VcQIa__3oU5nSdYsq9DZ2A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I would recommend this place more for their coffee than their food. I had the grilled caprese. I wasn't very happy with it. They have very unique sides though - veggie samosas, chips, and chille. But I would definitely recommend this restaurant for its coffee. They have some unique flavors - we got their Flava in da Caramel Latte and the Laid Back Vanilla Mocha. The caramel latte was more bitter than expected but the mocha tasted just as I thought; very sweet. They bring you your coffee pre-mixed, so the milk, espresso, and other flavoring is divided and you mix it all together yourself - pretty unique! Would return for their coffee!"}, {"review_id": "z9yp4rDQ0x_RJx6L3L9uCA", "user_id": "hxbVXTvZ0l-WblrFFyDe3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "A cafe that reminds me of all the best aspects of cafes in the rest of the world -- cheap and really fresh and tasty eats, amazing coffee -- plus all the creature comforts of an American coffeeshop -- pleasant service, Wifi, outlets, exposed brick and elbow room.Today they're brewing a Burmese coffee that can be prepared using any of the fancy gadgets (pour over, Aeropress, French press, etc.) you'd find in hipster Wicker Park, and it is delicious. There's outdoor seating along the river and bike path and enough space for a meeting with a group.And the place is on a mission.

Endiro Coffee started in Uganda a few years ago. They have three locations there and Aurora is the first one in the United States.

And they have labeled vegan items. In the past you'd have to go 40 miles east to Chicago to get something like this.Best of all, they don't just serve simple coffee; they serve Ugandan coffee with three different types of filter methods, from the rustic to the high-tech.I got the Hario Woodneck coffee ($3.50) which they make with a cotton cloth filter and serve in a glass decanter. It's an unusual preparation, with rare beans, and great taste---earthy, aromatic.The avocado toast ($5) is normally served only until 11 a.m. but on weekends they might serve it longer. It's a small portion, on crispy bread with an ultra-thin sun-dried tomato spread, and tastes all right.The veggie samosas ($3.50) are also vegan (but this isn't indicated on the menu) and quite tasty.Endiro also has quality loose-leaf teas, including a Ugandan variety that tasted great ($3.50).The service was really friendly, helpful and attentive. I'd give Endiro an extra star if they had vegan baked goods and a couple more vegan food items (how about a tofu or seitan sandwich?). I can't wait to try this place in the summer, when you can sit outside and watch the river."}, {"review_id": "ngf4XX9WIs9oeKWWDTneFg", "user_id": "F9vYcUknd9JY2lxsaEObQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Endiro Coffee is the kind of place my heart always longs for when I'm thinking about losing myself in a good book. It's open space, but somehow cozy. It's friendly staff are never overbearing. It's just perfect for a latte on an easy day.My husband and I found ourself at EC while looking for a local coffee roaster. We wanted to pick up a bag of grounds for a Christmas present, but we ended up staying for a drink. They also sell food, but we had just eaten so we didn't partake.Upstairs is a little more work friendly, but downstairs we found couches and communal seating. The whole place has a traditional meets urban feel. So if you're with a group, make your way downstairs. And our waitress had no issue delivering or drinks downstairs and she actually did come and check on us before we cashed out which I didn't expect at all.I ordered a latte and I really appreciated that I was asked if I wanted a dark, medium, or light roast. I went with a medium and my latte was perfect. Just enough pick me up, not too sweet, and a smooth taste.I would absolutely come back to EC for drinks or a nice, leisurely lunch. And the waitress let us know that the town they're located in is really getting revitalized so there's some cool places to check out nearby too. Such a nice spot."}, {"review_id": "G5qjRY4HLmrVWVThY30bFg", "user_id": "3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Endiro is exactly what I'd been wishing for in downtown Aurora.  Downtown Aurora has been lacking a coffee shop for, well, forever.  There isn't even a Dunkin or a Starbucks nearby.  Endiro is more than just a coffee shop, so comparing them to either of those chains is really a slap in the face.  I apologize, Endiro.Coffee at Endiro is sourced from Uganda.  Check out their website and learn more about all of that.  It'll give you a warm, fuzzy feeling and make you want to support Endiro with all your heart (and hard-earned money).We came here for dinner.  Yes, there is a small food menu with mostly sandwiches, but it's suitable for lunch or dinner.  The coffee and food were both five stars.My coffee choice was the \"Black Tie.\"  Mocha.  Lavender.  Blackberry.  You could really taste the lavender too.  Although I was trying to limit my caffeine intake at the time, I happily consumed this and had no regrets.The Aurora Cheesesteak, a sandwich filled with tender steak and melted cheese curds, exceeded my expectations for what I'd consider \"coffee house food.\"  Food isn't an after-thought here.This is a quiet, but not too quiet, space that suits many purposes.  Whether it's a casual dinner or coffee date, working, reading, or chatting with friends, there's plenty of seating including a downstairs area.  I saw some working solo here and even a family with a few children.Parking in the area is relatively easy.  There is plenty of street parking and free lots nearby."}, {"review_id": "k0lyoRe4n6PYovJpck-hNA", "user_id": "s-12pKS5XeYgZzgJz2WZJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Come for the coffee, stay for the breakfast, lunch and more.

I'm surprised I have not been to this place earlier since we started living in N. Aurora. They have some serious coffee beans that definitely satisfies your hunt for good coffee. Loved the ambience and the fact that its right by the river. Came here very early on a snowy winter morning and the whole experience was perfect. Parked on the street right outside the door and walked into warmth and coffee aroma. Had the chicken and waffles and sausage over great morning conversations. Definitely recommending this place for a nice quiet morning. They get busier later on in the morning at about 9am onwards as the staff had mentioned so you might want to consider that. Will keep coming back here for sure. Don't forget to check in through Yelp and get your discount. They were also kind enough to give me discount coupons for my next visit."}, {"review_id": "0yeTrucDZEz6gWr0pVDZpg", "user_id": "x3fWKenQZnxRyjk1YV8_Zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Cozy welcoming vibes as soon and you walk inside.

Located in downtown Aurora next to the bridge on New York St., the location offered quite a lot of appeal for me. The facility itself had a pleasant vintage feel. We had no trouble parking but I could see where that could be an issue at times.It was relatively busy when we walked in though we were able to sit down and be served very quickly. In general, I thought the service was polite and efficient. There were several options on the menu, including some food items that sounded as though they might be good. But we were there for the java. I tried an Americano while my son had a Woodneck pour-over. We were both happy with our selections and with the ambiance this place offered. The latter is just as important for a coffee shop as the former. The prices were a tad on the expensive side but, for what it was, I thought the cost was worth it.
