Hostess was great, seated quickly... then all downhill from there.Ordered drinks, which didn't come until the salad and dinner arrived.Two of the three steaks were not cooked as requested and then after clearing the main dish plates we waited ~ 20 minutes to get the waiters attention for dessert menus.No waiter stopping by during the entire time to ask how the meals were, need anything?, etc.The only thing that did arrive quickly, was the check!Certainly not worth the $$ for this, doubtful if we will return"}, {"review_id": "9QxwmYy3VY0qI06L67nJjQ", "user_id": "hI5ySqMDhXvwY4LkhJpsJg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "My husband and I have been frequenting One Eleven for over 13 years and I have to say that the last couple of visits have been less than enjoyable. We were there last weekend. Ordered a dozen shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were flavorless. We opted for the greens that come with the meals and my husband commented that it is one of the smallest \"salads\" he's ever seen. And he was right. There were maybe 3-4 bites. My husband ordered the pepper encrusted NY sirloin (his usual) and it was good. Came out piping hot, cooked to his liking (med-well), lots of flavor/well seasoned and his sides which came with the meal (mashed potato and button mushrooms) were also very flavorful.However, my 8 oz filet was less than desirable and I'm kicking myself for not sending it back. First, it was warm at best and as I got to the center, it was cold. I ordered it medium and it was pretty red but that didn't bother me as much as the sour taste. Additionally it lacked ANY and ALL flavor/seasoning and was extremely difficult to cut - even with my steak knife. And a filet should be easy to cut - even with a butter knife. We ordered the brussels sprouts as a side dish and they were mushy. All in all a poor experience. I think the restaurant has gone down hill the last few years. Go elsewhere where the food is more interesting."}, {"review_id": "X1eHPPteE42xNuh7HWbduA", "user_id": "N61hkQVfKF0GXP3UIVnbWw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "One Eleven Chop House is snazzy steakhouse with a casual romantic setting. Surrounded by huge vintage posters and light fixtures that looks like film reels, it felt like we were dining in a lounge at a theater. They served large portion dishes, prices are moderate, and have an extensive wine list, definitely a great atmosphere for a date night. Lamb Riblets- A nice tangy caramelized sauce on this fall-of-the-bone ribs.  Prime Rib- The cut was very strange. It looked like it was cut with a serrated edge knife and wasn't well-seasoned. The mash potatoes was good but the peas made it feel like I was eating school lunch. NY Sirloin- More peas!? This was mediocre steak at best and really needed salt and pepper.Overall Service: Just decent. We got a quiet server who was attentive here and there."}, {"review_id": "dKX0cxzuvHCG2LyufbWDFw", "user_id": "J8Nk-DLbBlXPriChFZL06w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Great job!

Definitely one of the best options in the area for a business-setting meal.Clams Royale came 6 to an order, nice crunchy topping but a bit over-salted. Was trying to detect what the breadcrumb topping was actually seasoned with but the salt was overwhelming. Clams still had a bit of brininess which was good.The house tomato bisque was surprisingly good. When I see bisque on a menu, I usually assume it's got too much cream but at One Eleven, the tomatoes were at the forefront with only a touch of dairy that tasted more like cheese than cream. Quite good.For entrees, we ordered the bone in rib-eye, haddock stuffed with scallop and spinach, the Statler chicken, and the hanger steak.Bone-in ribeye was tender and cooked just a little more rare, than medium-rare which is what was ordered. The sear on the outside was a little lacking to be honest (see picture for reference), but good beefy flavor overall.Haddock was cooked spot on. The fish was flaky but not tough as similar whitefish often tend to be. It was a generous portion and the stuffing was quite good, the sweetness of the scallops was still noticeable. The Statler chicken was a let down. Despite the fact that the menu said the chicken was cooked sous-vide, it was definitely on the drier side. Perhaps it sat too long in the pass or in crisping up the ham, the flame was too much. The risotto was not tomato-y at all, despite it being labeled \"tomato risotto.\" However, the toasted pine nuts and sprouts were very good.The hanger steak was solid - tender and somewhat loose in texture as hanger steak typically is. The roasted potatoes and green beans were seasoned with garlic and were fine. The steak sauce came in a little gravy boat on the side and tasted more like demi-glace than steak sauce to me (which is a plus!)For dessert, we tried a molten chocolate cake. It was not very molten, had good chocolate depth, but was a little over sweetened. Perhaps we got unlucky and got one that was overbaked."}, {"review_id": "H0fSuv6bUaalohSO2UB49g", "user_id": "99XNegD621N2kWpOcyzlGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Great place.

In the past 5 years I have had ONE steak I would say is worthy of the Chophouse old reputation. It's very sad and after last nights dinner my husband and I decided we will not return again.

My first experience with 111, was the gateway to steakhouses. I remember the night very vividly and it's something I won't forget. Last night after 6-7 years, that experience is now fading away. I've eaten at steakhouses around the world, and I'm pretty picky if I'm going to pay a pretty good penny on a steak. Our team of waitstaff was great and attentive. Everything was great till my steak came out. As soon as the runner put my plate down, I did as best as I could to not ruin a night with a friend I havent seen in a long time. The plate was cold, not piping hot. The side garnishment portions compared to my friends was way off. The steak, (this is the part you want to hear about) They had to used a sous vide method or they just put it in the oven. Either method works but here's where I got upset. THEY DIDNT SEAR THE STEAK! There was absolutely no grill marks not charring whatsoever to this fine 10 oz Prime Fillet! It looked like a piece of cardboard grey and no color. Low behold I cut into it and it's over cooked! I could have complained but I wasn't in the mood to ruin anyones night nor weekend. I will say their prices are pretty good compared to other steak houses, perhaps you get what you pay for now? If 111 expects to be at the top tier of steakhouses it's got some work to do in the kitchen to keep it consistent. This plate serving was a amateur mistake it should have never been sent out and it was inspected improperly. Perhaps it was an off night, but I've heard way too many complaints to return again. My place from now on when I'm back home will be this great steak place in the Seaport of Boston."}, {"review_id": "qzrMGj0wIl2k52Ft2c4EtA", "user_id": "glNMk1kNOhNfLPqA_4TXHw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2015", "text": "111 Chop House - Worcester, MA - 5/6/2015They have Valet parking... a big plus.My servers Ashley & Sarah were ultra friendly, very familiar with the menu and offered great recommendations...As I sit here deciding on tonights courses I am consumed by the wonderful aromas coming from just the other side of the glass... From where I sit I can see the kitchen staff preparing tonights feasts... Large open floor plan with lots of dark woods as you would expect from a high end steak house...A warm sliced loaf of bread was brought out with olive oil and ummmm... butter packets...

Crisp lettuce, Roasted Asparagus, Avocado, Hearts of Palm, Garbanzo Beans, Diced Radish and Capers, in a Shallot Honey Mustard Vinaigrette, Topped with Parmesan Cheese... The Capers added a nice touch to what usually is an ordinary salad in most steak houses... Really good and perfectly executed...For the main.. A Boyden Farm, All Natural Filet from Vermont... 8 Oz of prime beef (probably just tipped the scale very much prior to cooking)... Cooked to absolute perfection. Pink thru-out, cuts like butah and with a side of Hollandaise Sauce... The Au Gratin Potatoes were probably enough for four people to share... Not the usual thinly sliced but chunks... Good but not great... I prefer the other style... I don't think the chunks hold onto the flavour in quite the same manner the thin slices do...The dessert menu looked really good but given I almost over-dosed on that Salted Caramel Chocolate Dup Cake last night in Vermont, I think I will just opt for my signature Cappuccino and call it a night...The meal was very good but I'm not quite sure the price/value ratio was there...
