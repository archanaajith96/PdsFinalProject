Food is great like at all locations of Naf Naf (chicken kabob and saffron rice are my favorite), and staff is really nice. Sadly I can't eat the delicious pillowy pita bread now because of a gluten free diet, but when I told the guy at the counter I didn't need it he looked over to my dad (who was with me) and said, \"Would your dad like it?\" Thoughtful of him (& dad did like it!)This location is convenient to the mall and 59. Fabulous food and service; of course I will be back."}, {"review_id": "FedT6SzvzqOTuhL6adoaXQ", "user_id": "cNRXoL4DAjCppfgGDEwJPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "I have been to 3 different Naf Naf locations including the one at the Mall of America in Minnesota and the consistency of their food is a big positive. I love the beef tenderloin and the kifta Kabab pita sandwiches and their fries and sauces are super delicious. The chipotle style Mediterranean/Mid Eastern food places have opened up at every nook and corner but this place really rocks with fast, tasty options that tend to be on the healthier side compared to your run of the mill fast food joints."}, {"review_id": "5wF69tc-IQFsxEXxwU5BFA", "user_id": "g_uO9d37n0LP2MhAKUPFCQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "First time at this naf naf location, at first I was confused at the menu and ordering process, I hadn't realized that the menu differs by location. The locations that I've been prior are order as they make your food; while this location is order from the menu and they'll notify you when you're food is ready.Opted to order take out here and ordered a couple  veggie feast. They usually prepare the veggie feast in a single take out plate; however, the falafel end up getting soggy and doesn't travel well, so I asked if they would be able to package the individual items separately, in which they happily did! One slight hiccup was that they forgot to package the falafels; which they corrected fairly quickly and offered a couple extra pitas as well for the error.Overall was really impressed with the customer service at this location. The food at naf naf is fairly consistent across all locations so never disappoints!"}, {"review_id": "ce1WvzRS03wYoyexVS6yrw", "user_id": "cMH3GBevMrRxtD7UqtkkpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "First try at Naf Naf today after a rec from a friend.

He loves it, his coworkers, a very picky crew, also love it, so surely I was expected to like it too, right?! One thing that happened not too long ago that will probably forever change my expectations of places like Naf Naf and all the other places after it: The Halal Guys opened a store less than 2 miles from my house. I know, forever changed.So, here I go with my Naf Naf experience! I ordered the Chicken Shawarma, and it comes with pita and your choice of two sides: basmati rice, Israeli salad, or fries. I chose the rice and salad. For $11.99, seems a tad pricey. The food was ready pretty quickly. The portions are generous but then again, you're paying $12 a plate. I'll break down the different parts of my meal:-Chicken: a bit dry, not seasoned very well.-Basmati rice: dry; I struggled to eat this and eventually stopped and brushed it to the side-Pita: warm, delicious-Israeli salad: this was my favorite part of the meal - fresh and delicious. I ended up mixing this with most of the chicken and the rice to enhance those itemsI wanted to love this place a lot more, but for the price and the fact that I've been spoiled by so many good shawarma places near me, I just couldn't help but dream of all the better places as I was getting through my meal here. Maybe I'll give Naf Naf another try in the future, but definitely not dying to go back."}, {"review_id": "jToDeZ2z_bkyt4ibeJfwqA", "user_id": "8q7xPmUI05LI-xQN8DLOww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "Naf Naf Grill is a bit of a confusing chain, as for whatever reason they've got multiple locations but the way you order at them is different. We often go to the Naf Naf up near the Allstate Arena and the ordering process there is much more similar to Chipotle, which I massively prefer. At the other locations, you watch them make your pita sandwich and you can tell them how much or how little of each ingredient you want in it.At the Aurora location, you just order your food and they give you a buzzer. I feel like even if I try to completely explain what I want, it never turns out as good as it does at other locations. That being said, Naf Naf is some top-tier Mediterranean food. It's a little expensive for fast-ish food, but I think the quality more than makes up for it.But, for real, if the Aurora location has been your only Naf Naf experience, definitely try another location as the alternative ordering process is vastly superior."}, {"review_id": "Skwj6x_OyozHqEcpYEh96Q", "user_id": "3WQSsIOxr-mkrrvX2W8-dQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Tried this for the first time today, completely delicious... we had the chicken shawarma pita sandwiches with fries.

Such a great option for a pretty healthy fast casual meal.I stopped in for a carry out dinner for myself since my husband was out of town. I had a hankering for Mediterranean food and my trusty Yelp app reminded me of Naf Naf! This restaurant has been here for years now and I know there are other locations yet I still hadn't given them a try. I walked up to the counter and ordered the falafel plate. For my sides I chose Jerusalem salad and rice and then I got an additional side of hummus and a fountain drink. I was shocked when I went to pay and was told the total was $17 considering this was a \"fast food\" meal for one, but I actually was given a lot of food. Enough to have a second meal with leftovers!Everything was delicious! The falafel was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside which I love. I wasn't much a fan of their tzaziki sauce though. For some reason it had a burnt taste to me. The Jerusalem salad had yummy fresh ingredients and the rice and hummus were perfection as well.My meal and the hummus came with a side of Pita bread and oh my goodness is that Pita something else! It's literally like a fluffy cloud of Pita pocket heaven. So good.Naf Naf is a great option for something healthy and quick and since it's right by my house I'm sure I'll be back the next time I have a craving!"}, {"review_id": "l2JygPerSDnaNmS3_bV8RA", "user_id": "0ZbfYFiJivUzGWgOmjDRXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Ohhh I missed this place, I always order the same, chicken shawarma on a plate, usually with a side of hummus but not this time, I got the rice and home made chips, it has great flavor, it's a fast food twist to Mediterranean food, but the quality does not suffer, they are quick and delicious, the pita bread is hand made in front of you and they are always warm and fluffy, I wish they had one of these in Atlanta, there is lots of parking for these 4 degree days in Chicago, so just watch out for the ice and walk in, they could have had the heat on a bit higher, it was cold inside (not as much as outside ) prices are reasonable and ultimately what you go in for is the food, and I love it."}, {"review_id": "NQwzeQkaPBMLYbuzVFQghQ", "user_id": "gCcTzntd8kGVkd0qjoY2xA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Great food, the shawarma and falafel plate was very good.
