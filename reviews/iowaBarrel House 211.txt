There were six of us, the place was relatively empty with the exception of two ladies across from us and (what appeared to be a small company Christmas party). We were greeted immediately at our table, according to the receipt by Abby (who we assume was the manager). We ordered our drinks and they came pretty promptly. We ordered our food and the server did not write anything down... I had mentioned that I thought it was odd since we had many requests (dressing on the side etc.). The food took quite a while to come out, the lunch specials were decently priced, the food was bland, cool and uninspired. Our server seemed too busy to care that several of the orders were wrong and made it seem like it was our fault. All in all it was just ok... the soup was overly salty and the wraps were bland. Most of the food was warm at best. The cheese on my friends burger was not even melted. Maybe it was an off day, but I have to say our experience was lacking. I had mentioned to our server that I got charged for something I didn't order, and she rudely said \"then pay the difference\"... I'm sorry but that's up to you... you are charging my card, not me. After we paid and signed our credit card receipts, the waitress came back to accuse my friend of \"not giving her a signed copy\", I know for a fact that we did because I collected all of the receipts myself and handed them to her... again we were made to feel like it was our fault... it is too bad we had a bad experience because we are traveling with a group of 32 and were looking for a place to all go tonight for dinner. We will have to try some place else, because the way we were treated was not good. And it shouldn't have taken us over 90 minutes for lunch."}, {"review_id": "_dg9x9CsnT68Vsiu7uiFSQ", "user_id": "hleCgRD9_lTzvRMOcMl5LA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "In town for a convention, the hotel highly recommended this small burger place.Group of 4 guys with varying tastes accepted this offer and decided to go. Gotta talk you, highly amazed!!Walking in I saw a bar scene with a kitchen in the back.  Loud music but rocking atmosphere!!On the order was fish and chips, plan burger, a cheese burger and my order of French fry nachos and the Carolina Burger.The nachos were exactly as described, wonderful, hot, and full of cheese!!  Polished this off with no regrets.The Carolina burger was a direct hit out of the south.  Imagine a 1/4 pound patty topped off with pulled pork and coleslaw.  Usual toppings were present but not necessary.This burger was heaven on a plate!!High kudos to Taylor our server and to David who checked on us regularly just to make sure we were having a good time."}, {"review_id": "VIKSSSt-yBgnPXT0Mvbu1w", "user_id": "uPAvjh9X2cHBeuV-wOj32g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "Our server was very nice. We ordered the Diablo burger with slaw, Black bean burger with house fries, onion rings and flatbreads.The burgers were nice and tasty. The Wasabi and boom boom sauce with the onion rings was good.

The best finger foods and happy hour around town. I will be back and invite my friends. Sibi was our waitress. Customer service is 10/10 and so is the food. Immaculate comfort food!

We shared appetizers consisting of soft pretzels and guacamole/chips. I ordered the steak burrito which came with rice and a side of lettuce with sour cream. I felt the burrito itself was uninspired, especially the tortilla it was wrapped in. It wasn't treated with any heat so it was dry, especially at the ends of the burrito. The contents of the burrito weren't so great, the steak a bit on the low quality side and the rice seemed to have been reheated possibly multiple times. I normally don't eat at bars but I'm sure that this is the norm."}, {"review_id": "BAcCHA13rdttaCupeBMNIQ", "user_id": "kFALxDqMuC-y86w1hu-43Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Always great food.

Ordered the hot wings for an appetizer and a cowboy burger for the entree with barrel fries and a side of cottage cheese. The wings came out hot and offered a great buttery spicy note , definitely worth ordering. The cowboy burger was good, filling , but nothing to write home about. The surprise of today's visit was the cottage cheese and its hidden surprise. Not sure if it was a piece of fried chicken or toasted bun , definitely did not belong in the middle of the cup of cottage cheese! Needless to say I no longer wanted to continue to dig into it and brought it the attention of our server. They apologized as did the manger and offered to replace it with another , but my hidden treasure adventure was done for the day. Those of you looking to dine with an adventurous spirit I recommend the cottage cheese, who knows what treasures may be unearthed."}, {"review_id": "6hYQN3vUcw59y0msWLAi4Q", "user_id": "8qVkvnpIeGT1a56pXzzEIA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "Menu is lacking options and creativity, if you're going to do it big, do it right!"}, {"review_id": "8NpZG38EachFG1yQSkLlVg", "user_id": "aZHA8Djg9HpXUrhXNftMCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "Very good food.

The food.. I had the boom boom chicken enchiladas and some of the sidewinders as I wanted to try their different sauces.  The enchiladas were very good.. but I was expecting a bit more spice.  The sidewinders were deep fried and I'm sure full of fat.. moderation right?  Their sauces... are AMAZING.  I'd take a couple bottles to go if I could.  Overall, a very good experience at a reasonable price.  I'll swing by next time I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "AwOBWNRvnpswgjmWWfKftg", "user_id": "y86buigMKCRpJ6HO0xEVjw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/12/2017", "text": "Great location with the best late night hours, I went for the half off apps.
