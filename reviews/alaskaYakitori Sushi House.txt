The owner, Jeff, is one of the most personable individuals I've come across in a restaurant. The food is some of the best Japanese you can have in town. I can't think of very many (if any) other places that serve yakitori, zaru soba or hamachi kama (or collar). They usually don't have much supply for the latter, but their salmon kama is just as good, with fatty lumps of meat you can pick cleanly off the bone.As far as rolls go, they're all excellent. My favorite is the Izakaya roll, which is basically a medley of all my favorite things--spicy tuna, cream cheese, eel, shrimp and avocado. Such great texture and the closest you can to achieving an actual mouthgasm.Good vibes, excellent food and the fact that they carry Hitachino Nest Beer? What more do you need in life?"}, {"review_id": "Bb9YTErfrABz6u-SSstfQg", "user_id": "9ddeIKpb8u24klUqForrsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "My first time at Yakitori was today and while neither of us ordered yakitori, there were plenty of menu options to choose from to leave people satisfied.The restaurant is off busy Tudor road in a strip mall, but parking was plentiful if icy. Yakitori is rather small, with maybe ten tables and half a dozen seats at the sushi bar.There was only one server who was tending to many tables and she seemed very rushed, but her service was still attentive and food came out quickly.They offer an \"All Day\" Happy Hour -- we had to ask to see that menu, though. They have a small sampling of meals and some rolls (that come with soup and salad) for discounted prices.The miso was pretty typical of any sushi place. The salad was DELICIOUS with a gingery-sesamey dressing served over fresh, crisp lettuce. I wish I could have ordered a bucket of that dressing to take home!My husband ordered one of the happy hour rolls and a pork katsu meal, the latter of which was very generous and he had leftovers to take home. I ordered an appetizer of sweet potato tempura and a couple of the happy hour green belt (vegetarian-friendly) rolls. The happy hour rolls were smaller rolls, but still satisfying; I ended up having to take some of mine home, too.For having only one server, there were probably four people behind the sushi bar, all of whom had greeted us when we entered and said thank yous and goodbyes when we left.For my first visit, this was great! I will return."}, {"review_id": "YEjg5n80aXVC-Sgvd-7q-w", "user_id": "5u6QNQmmdyeV8SAIFtNd8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "So it turns out that no one in Anchorage can give you suggestions for restaurants to get good seafood because none of them pay to go out and eat seafood - they just buy or catch and cook it themselves. We wanted to take advantage of the fresh local catches and figured sushi was a good way to do so. This place came recommended and we were not disappointed. After a trip where we'd eaten in a lot of breweries, it was also a nice, light change after some heavy meals.Everything was delicious. It was a bit busy, but our server was really attentive and helpful and our food was beyond delicious. After a day of hiking I was starving and this fit the bill. I really liked the \"pre meal\" menu of options where you could get a kabob or quite a few other appetizer like options."}, {"review_id": "T8ZnKKjCRCWEOQgkEMtDTA", "user_id": "K0bgKpDtf4W6as8WTFPYWQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "I was SO looking forward to eating here, but once we started to eat..I was disappointed. The service was really great, attentive and friendly the whole night. The overall vibe of the place is fun and easy-going.Nigiri Tuna, Unagi, Hotate, Toro: actual fish and seafood were pretty good, the rice was really dry. It completely ruined the taste of the nigiri as a wholeNigiri Amaebi: expected to get the fried shrimp heads from the amaebi, but when I asked about it, the server said that they don't serve that because their shrimp doesn't come with heads on (which also made me question the freshness of the seafood). I was really confused, I don't think I've ever ordered that and not gotten the fried counterparts. Yakitori: if I had to choose a favorite, it was the beef tongue (in comparison to chicken gizzard, chicken hearts, and bacon wrapped scallop). The flavors were lacking, and the sauce on the scallops was distracting.TL;DR food meh with good service"}, {"review_id": "WiFclRzqQzjvIvgAIxwHnQ", "user_id": "xnlJgTOAXQRmEoZs9401kw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "AMAZING SERVICE.Ordered a bunch of different rolls and we got a cute little bowl of salad and miso soup on the house. Rolls were all really good. Don't have much complaints since I love sushi a ton. After we finished we got another complimentary thing which was dessert: deep fried Oreos with some sort of whipped cream. Super rich but pretty good. Definitely recommend this sushi place in this location!"}, {"review_id": "EXkPClzID_EhsQwsNbkHGA", "user_id": "WnmpoXmXzLpAU6W4-yseZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Best sushi in town. Reasonably priced for a sushi place. We've eaten here during peak hours and still got our sushi rolls out fast. Raw fish has always been fresh and doesn't leave a fishy aftertaste. You can tell they use good quality fish as it has the right time and not mushy. Staff is very attentive and friendly.

Everything that we ordered was perfect and I can imagine that we wouldn't have been disappointed with anything on the menu. I found the restaurant browsing on Yelp and the pictures lured us in. We were seated at a cozy table in the corner and our server came over right away. She was very friendly and attentive, constantly filling our waters and coming over with a smile. All of the staff seemed to be similarly happy and great at their jobs. We ordered the Sashimi bento box lunch special and two of the chef's daily special rolls; the I LOVE YELLOWTAIL roll and the Baked scallop roll. We were blown away with the generous portions and the amazing, strong flavors in everything. The miso soup was the best i've had and their house dressing is wonderful (you can buy it for a great price to serve at home) I can't wait to come back to anchorage to try more of their menu items!"}, {"review_id": "xYVFKCEJUnRJLK5gyvn5zQ", "user_id": "e6DzrhFWHPYrGIMu5Y_hNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/25/2017", "text": "This is one of my favorite spots in Anchorage.

They wanted sushi and I automatically wanted to take them here. If you've read my previous review, I first came here with my boyfriend he was visiting so alot of memories came back. Anyway, after we ordered soft shell crab for our appetizer and for our rolls, we got a Hot Night Roll, Sexy Girl Roll, and a Best of The Best Roll, we got our miso soup and salad. Everything came out in a very timely matter. We probably ate it all within a 15 mins span. Haha. We were probably too hungry but we really enjoyed it. The rolls came out right when we finished our appetizer, which is always nice. Definitely will come back another time. The only thing I would suggest a tweek in, is the water they serve. The taste is not the best but doable."}, {"review_id": "LwKm8LI3nXGhsUCBuClAsQ", "user_id": "FS6eZcgX0vfcNWxalm5pqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "This deserves the number one rating in Anchorage.
