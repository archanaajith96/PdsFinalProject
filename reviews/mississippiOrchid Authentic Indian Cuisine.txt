The food is authentic, prepared and cooked with heart and given with great attitude. Every time I go, I know I can expect a good meal. If you're new to Indian food, ask for a recommendation. The staff are very gracious and will help you find something you love. Indian foods are boldy flavored and often spicy but they can customize the flavor for you. They are very good at that. Just ask and they'll do the rest. Go now! Don't forget to get some samosas for appetizer."}, {"review_id": "fuvibKHuVBDgmKWd9VUXXQ", "user_id": "Bgc3fn4xAU9OQuGLJwa1Pg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Been here 4 times now and each experience has been great. I highly recommend the thali dish because you just get a large variety of food to try and it looks so beautiful! I would say that each time it has been pretty difficult to get the check at the end of the meal but the staff is very nice, seems to be a family owned restaurant. The actual vibes of the location are a little below average, for example, one time we went there was a bug zapper being used in the corner that was really loud and slightly terrifying hahaAll in all though, the food here is very unique, especially for this area! I definitely recommend the location (:"}, {"review_id": "8gESm4eMX5GE5Kigv5QfWg", "user_id": "tmAx6poivvG70cFKn_b9Lg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Thursday Dinner: The prices are disgustingly expensive. I'm from California and I've never paid $$ for a small dish of curry. I ordered lamb tikki masala ($16). There was less than 2 ounces of meat and a lot more sauce to make the dish look full. Very upset.Ambiance: Decor is traditional. Service: Good.Lunch would be much better.

This was my very first Indian experience; however, I consider myself an experienced foodie. The atmosphere and service was very inviting and the food was amazing! My favorite was the appetizer, Samosa Chaat which was served with two vegetable samosa topped with cucumber, onions, yogurt, cilantro, chick peas and a spicy curry sauce. Delicious! For our entree we decided to share the Gaira Sakahari Bhojan because it gave us the chance to enjoy 3 different curry options with 3 different meat options. (chicken, lamb and goat) My favorite was the coconut chicken but all were exquisite with a very authentic taste. We followed up with a tasty traditional dessert, Carrot Halwa. I would recommend this restaurant for any occasion! We will most likely try their lunch buffet tomorrow for a little more variety!"}, {"review_id": "_GsvJsAgykPCcQg5V5zgmw", "user_id": "EWzMOoCiq9rzaUm5qBJOQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2017", "text": "When I say this is hands down, the best authentic Indian food in the entire state of Mississippi, I really mean it's the best Indian food in the entire state of Mississippi!

I was craving indian food and thank goodness we found this place. Their food selection was perfect to satisfy my cravings. They had one guy waiting on all the tables and two othrr guys taking food to the tables. The restaurant got busy and we had to wait several times on certain orders. We had requestes extra rice but it never came...but despite that aspect of our meal we were full and satisfies. Two entrees that comes with rice and coffee our bill was about $36.

In town for a few weeks from New York and this place was recommended by friends. Dine in seating with prompt service. We however opted for take out instead. We ordered the Saag Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masala, Basmati Rice, Paratha/Naan Bread. Both Dishes were savory in flavor however lacked appropriate portions. They should also consider using boneless chicken thigh pieces as oppose to breast. Breast pieces tends to be dry and doesn't compliment the curry. Sagg could've used more Paneer cheese pieces but was flavorful. Paratha is a Breakfast staple and was delicious along with Roti and Naan. A buffet is always a good option to try as one could try a variety of dishes to savor."}, {"review_id": "06zi4JupNP3pXbZEq5GwuQ", "user_id": "XspN6dSGYBv6S7QVJ2tEpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Here for training like many and was really needing a food option which felt a little cleaner than many of the options around town.
