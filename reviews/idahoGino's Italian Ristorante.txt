What happened to this wonderful, special place? This was our go to restaurant when in town. We would brag, even home in CA, about this wonderful restaurant. It was ideal in every way: service, food and wine choices/knowledge.Something bad happened. It has changed dramatically.Let's start with what is still right:WINE: Although there are fewer by-the-glass wines available, Gino's seems to still be making good choices. The downside is that the wait staff does not appear to be educated on the wines. When we asked for recommendations, it was clear that we may as well flip a coin. The waitress responded with statements like, \"That's an Italian wine\". Thanks for the insight. And she never followed up to ask if we liked our choices. FRIENDLINESS: The staff is still friendly and energetic. Now for the things that have gone noticeably downhill:AMBIENCE: No more white tablecloth dinner service. Instead, customers eat on a table imprinted with a colorful Aztec styled design. When I inquired, our waitress said that the white tablecloths were getting soiled. Yes, and . . . ?   Not what I expect from an upscale romantic Italian restaurant.FOOD: So disappointing. One of the big issues is that the new chef overdoes the sauce. Overdoes is an understatement. I have no idea whether my expensive filet and risotto were good because they were drenched in bad sauce. Same for every other dish we ordered at dinner and 2 days earlier, at lunch. I am a sauce person. I like sauce. But this was ridiculous. The appetizers of stuffed mushrooms were obviously burned. When we said we wanted to send them back, the waitress looked down at the black crispy mushrooms (see photo) and asked WHY we didn't like them. Owners: Please educate your staff.I'm so sad to find that my fav restaurant is no longer the restaurant that it once was."}, {"review_id": "XiESgoefQclXLzxOlzkitw", "user_id": "vexbpFNWNuP69WcRU4darQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "The service was good when the waiter came by but the ticket times are off the charts.....I have been sitting waiting for pizza for literally 45min (after the salad).

I had been to Gino's a few times prior to this event date and it had been okay. On December 12, I took my BF to dinner to Gino's. He'd never been there. We ordered appetizers, salads, entree's, bottle of wine, etc. I wanted him to have a very nice birthday dinner. It took a little while for our entrees to come out. He ordered a seafood dish, I had the chicken piccata. We start eating and I immediately noticed something was \"different\" with my dinner. It was fairly favorless and the most strange texture. Not wanting to cause I scene, I took a few more bites and struggled to swallow them. When my BF asked how my meal was, I gave him a bite and said, \"tell me what's going on with this chicken?\" He didn't even get a full bite on it and had to spit it out. We figured out that my chicken was raw. It was disgusting! That is a texture that I'll never forget. We called over the waiter (Tyson, I believe) and told him about it and encouraged them to take a bite of it. He asked what else I would like and assured me they would take that dish off the bill. He came back with my new entree a bit later (just fettuccine alfredo). It was fine. The executive chef came out and apologized, I think. He spoke so quietly, I couldn't hear a thing he said. I just assume it wasn't apology. Our waiter proceeded to come back and tell us that he was taking some partial blame for the raw chicken because he ordered the wrong dish for me originally. Then, when the BF's dish came up and my dish wasn't correct, the kitchen tried to hurry my correct dish along. FAIL!I was so nauseated that I really didn't touch my fettuccine and our evening was ruined. Thanks Gino's! I doubt we'll be back.Michelle, I wholeheartedly agree with you!!! It wasn't a cheap dinner and to have that experience.... YUK! The chef's half-hearted apology, which we could not hear, was almost comical. We could tell he wasn't happy about having to come out and say it.Also, we told friends about our experience and they had the same issues - food either being too done or not done enough. They stopped going for the same reason."}, {"review_id": "EaiB4KgUICdOFxIwwt0VOQ", "user_id": "YEI06MnzZWDJJZosxITOBA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Greeted by a friendly host....  the food was ok at most.  I had the special ( scallops ) they were sandy.   The staff were not very friendly for the most part ... there clearly was an issue going on in the back as the older waitress would walk by and she was mumbling some of the issues to herself.  This was my second visit and sadly my last."}, {"review_id": "IWiEYtFrkiCLQcMdhzLtxQ", "user_id": "ZrFRI8MfRiK2MAnoCVSZXg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "Sigh, I have been to Gino's soo many times. even when he was still in downtown Boise.

I usually stick to the traditional offerings. Meat with red sauce. I have had the osso bucco , and lamb shank many times, and really enjoyed it. This time I ventured out and tried the seafood raviolis. Pretty bland, left me wishing I stuck with the standards.My girl had the veal, and peppers. The veal was overcooked, and we had to ask for a steak knife to cut it with.We did order a nice Primativo wine (bottle), and it was a very good value ($30.00). We enjoyed it very much.We will go back at some point, but we will try other options as well."}, {"review_id": "_BlU0J4CSYv8FouJGpDe4g", "user_id": "-1r011caTzL59aGHb6MhpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Superb meal!

Don't go. Nothing worse than a disappointing dinner for my birthday. Service: Okay but not what you would expect for what they are trying to be as a restaurant. Ambiance: Not a romantic quiet dinner, eclectic   tight space that is unfortunately very loud. Beverages: I had water but my husband had a white sangria. Was served in a water glass, very strong. Which I guess is okay since it was $9. Food: Ordered calamari for our appetizer, decent but very salty. Soup was also a bit salty, salad was a basic salad nothing special. My husband ordered a veal dish with a brown butter sauce and it was served with spaghetti noodles. Flavor was mediocre, not a lot happening in the dish. Not something I would order for $26 . I decided to try the pancetta, mushroom alfredo. Here is the where it ruined the experience  for us. My pasta was not done, and yes I understand good pasta is al dente, this was just under done crunchy pasta. Mushrooms were just complete mush, not a great saute mushroom. Pancetta, Ha ha you mean 2 inch strips of bacon. Some delicious pancetta would have added a delicious salty addition to this pasta which it needed. Instead I had an earthy dirt tasting pasta that I didn't even eat more than 5 bites of. Overall: If you are expecting a high quality delicious Italian dinner, this is not the place I would recommend. They are pretending to be something they are not. If you are going to charge like an upscale restaurant you better serve the highest quality food you can. Disappointed.

It's probably a good thing we live over 30 miles away or I'd be overfed and broke. It was fairly early when we stopped in, about 3:50 on a Saturday night, and there were only a few patrons inside. However, by the time we finished our meal, including dessert, it was around five and people were starting to emerge out of the woodwork. I think I'd suggest reservations for evening just to be sure you have a table. Our server, Jennifer, was awesome, even if she jokingly gave me a bad time at the encouragement of my wife!  Jennifer knew the cuisine very well and her suggestions were on target for our first time here. The menu is quite extensive, and you will most likely have a hard time deciding what to choose. We started out with stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, and these were nothing like what we've ever had before. A slightly breaded mushroom making a crusty outside with delicious marinara sauce, cheese, spices and sausage on the inside. You can also choose meatball if you wish. These were $9 for six of them, but very well worth the price. Almost forgot, the bread with the most heavenly oil and garlic mixture started us off. Mouth watering. They have two styles of bread, one during the lunch hours and a sourdough during he evening hours. With our arrival, we got a mixture of both and not one complaint from us. I had the vegetable alfredo for a main course while my wife had a dish called Pollo Maria, so named after the mother of the owner, Gino. Both were entrees were amazing.My wife was pleased rwith the selection of wines available, and again, Jennifer knew excellent choices for my wife to have during the pre-dinner samplings as well as her main course. I had to be a good boy due to Doctors orders after surgery!  I had the iced tea which was great. None of that stale tea taste here. For dessert we had a creme brûlée and a chocolate/Marion berry torte. Why do they make such tempting things to eat!! You won't be disappointed if you save room. Not sure if this happens every night or if it was due to the weekend, but the owner was there, dressed like a true Italian (he'd have made my Italian Grandma proud!), and was a hands on-making sure things go smoothly person. Made it a point to make contact with everyone to ensure their meal experience was going well. There is a small bar area to sit at with about six bar stools, and forgive Meir I'm wrong, but I believe there were four 4 chaired high top tables directly in front. I believe the tables are to be seated by the hostess also. The bar area is just inside the door and to the right behind he hostess. Warmer weather allows for the outside seating area to be enjoyed, and he italian music will keep you smiling during your time here."}, {"review_id": "ylTeFDfevvvr28EESA1U4g", "user_id": "nuESv6JeYhIpidfpLI8O8w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "6/3/2017", "text": "I considered giving this place three stars, but used my better judgement and gave it two.

I called in a to go order and they told me my order would be ready in 15-20 minutes. I arrived 30 minutes later (allowed extra time just to make sure it was ready) and to my dismay they had no record of my order and never even put it in the system. So I had to wait even more. This hurts my heart- I really loved it here but the service just gets worse and worse every time I come and try to give it another chance. When you pay the higher prices for a meal you expect higher service.Pizza no!I have an update for this place for the pizza. Do not get it. I ordered a pizza with extra sauce. When I arrived I got extra cheese and hardly any sauce. I asked if they could redo it and I actually heard the waitress asked the cooks how they made my pizza and I heard them say extra cheese. Then she said it was supposed to be made with extra sauce and hey backtracked. The guy was rude and said he didn't want to remake It and if he did he would still put the same amount of sauce on it. Way to please the customer?!!! On top of that we're all the looks between them as if how dare I ask to receive what I ordered. The manager should take care of this and teach the take out side to show the same type of professionalism as the dining are. I don't pay to catch an attitude. Dining yesThe very best food I've had in the area- hands down. They have a great ambience, great service and delicious food. Their bread is super good- has garlic and herbs baked into the bread, and their dipping sauce goes so well with it: garlic, olive oil, and pepper flakes for a kick.  My favorite meal here is the lamb shank.  It tickles your palette in all the right ways. There's so much goodness about the dish- basil, garlic, San Marzano tomatoes and gnocchi. Let me tell you how I never even knew I liked gnocchi until I experienced this creation at Gino's. They are like light velvety pillows. I'm not even a big pasta girl and I adore these. The dish is slow braised, tender and moist meat. I wouldn't change or add a thing to it. It's about $30, but you are given a Generous portion. Easily 2.5 meals. The service here is great- they don't come every 5 seconds, but also don't disappear. They have mastered the right amount of contact and top it off with delicious and fresh tasting food."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/ginos-italian-ristorante-meridian-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
