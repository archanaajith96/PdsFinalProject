It is located in a downtown Phoenix. Hard to tell what to expect on a first visit. Upon entering one is greeted with a cozy, intimate setting. Decorations are appropriate and unobtrusive. Very clean.Service: Professional appearance and very kind.Food: Excellent. sushi tastes fresh and there is a wide variety. \"Omakase\" and \"O my God\" is the best I have ever tried.  Rolls are made with attention to detail and are presented beautifully.  Best! Best! Best! sushi restaurant in the Phoenix downtown area. Price: Prices reasonable. Eat here if you crave high quality sushi and rolls.Final impressions: This restaurant is a real diamond in the rough. This will quickly become one of your favorite places to eat. I strongly recommend calling ahead to set up a reservation, because if you go there without one during busy times you will wait for up to 45 minutes for a seat. Always very busy, which is a good sign for a restaurant. Rating Breakdown: Five stars easily. Top notch food. Fast, friendly, and attentive staff. This is how a sushi restaurant is supposed to look and taste. Other five star reviews are accurate. Be prepared to add a new favorite to your list.."}, {"review_id": "4TmVpRGBPfhHolzdvE3f1A", "user_id": "qOn1VFThKD5y5zrFEQXpGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Gotta love Harumi!  They have *REALLY* know what they are doing...and they do it well!All of the countless rolls of sushi we ordered (WAY too much) were all excellent!  They have nice large rolls so be careful how many you order!This is, by far, our favorite Sushi place in downtown!"}, {"review_id": "G1jcIJoLpIc1JzJTLwGttQ", "user_id": "-7EONpQYJxo6nDy-hIgKBw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Garbage garbage garbage. We came to this restaurant and put down our names; we were hungry, but we could last the 15-25 min wait. 40 minutes later, we went to check on the status of our seat. We found that our name had been crossed off their list.Having been appolagized to and told it would be only 15 more minutes, we settled in to wait a bit longer. After 25 minutes of hearing nothing from the staff, we went to investigate again. We were told they were closing. They wouldn't seat us.Incompetent and infuriating, the staff wasted our time, and by the time they were done fucking us, other restaurants nearby were closed.

We ordered edamame, veggie tempura, and a bunch of sashimi and sushi to share family style.  I had a seaweed salad and I believe a few miso soups were ordered as well.  The boys enjoyed some saki while Jules and I went with iced green tea, which as really refreshing.We were impressed with the quality of the sashimi (yellowtail and salmon) and the forbidden / purple rice they use in the rolls is tasty and unique with plenty of health benefits per the signage around the restaurant.  Prices are reasonable and service is quick and friendly.It's exciting to see how much the downtown restaurant scene has exploded over the years.  There are plenty of options to choose from, and Harumi is definitely a solid choice -- especially if you're craving sushi.  Looking forward to return visits (and likely my husband will join me now too.)  Either way, I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "hC-KvqSOGHh7nGeyW-j9Rw", "user_id": "OQBMu7x0V4Oz3iFv3x0i5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "I dropped by Harumi sushi for a quick dinner, around 8pm. It seemed pretty busy but I got my food quickly. You order off a paper menu, checking things off. I had a three mini roll combo and two types of nigiri: scallops and seared tuna. I didn't love the rolls but the nigiri were good, with fresh fish and good proportioning between rice and fish. For a quick, no frills sushi dinner, I would be back, but would stick to nigiri. The purple rice was fun and different - I prefer white rice but they pull it off okay."}, {"review_id": "bBlp2mN6M3E1Sw8XRbjDZA", "user_id": "hHsQX-aOgOsJItnlI_8owg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Not a bad place at all, I would love to give it 3.5 stars but I can't. I went on a Wednesday night and this place was packed, so naturally I was very excited. I ordered the salmon sushi and a mini combo roll (rainbow, Las Vegas, and I believe the Oasis). The fish quality wasn't that bad, but the rice was a bit sweet (and purple). I don't really like sweet things in general and the rice took away some of the flavor of the fish, which was disappointing to me. The construction of the rolls was clever and tasty so good job to the designers. Realistically, if you want some good sushi in the area then stop by this place, but I don't think I'll be back on account of the sweet rice. Lastly, the prices here are very reasonable."}, {"review_id": "zOYTB5QUB-BG0SYwO3d_XA", "user_id": "UArmrPaSx2j--P_lwYU0IQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "We were really hungry and we were looking for some good Asian food in Downton phoenix.

This is how I would describe Harumi Sushi. It's hard for me to fall in love with sushi here in the middle of the desert; but I was pretty wow'd by Harumi Sushi when we were here the other night. My favorite was a H3 Roll, ( ABSOLUTE favorite!) ; Black rice in a roll!!! Yes please. The spicy tuna; The salmon; and the OMG! Which is in foil and flamed and lit up at table. We over ordered , as we usually do from not being able to decide or simply wanting to sample so many different things. The servings here at Harumi are generous. It's probably best to not be like us and order as you consume! Every roll was fresh and came out to us fast. The  wait staff wow'd us with great, friendly service and from the kitchen they even seem to have a fun environment too. It's nice to dine in a place like that! Love the location but parking here is kind of a bear at times and another 'con' is the bathroom is in a weird place. Let's be honest, sushi in the desert is always 'weird' to someone or maybe anyone who lived in the Californ-I-A but this is legit and I am a fan!"}, {"review_id": "AwwsDvv33xFFwandXqFG1A", "user_id": "yCwGlZqYnc4Q6qkVwCXfjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Our favourite sushi restaurant downtown.It's always packed with people so usually there is a wait for a table - but it's definitely worth the wait every time.We were a group of 7 this time and shared a number of different rolls.

The space isn't much to look at, but the staff is friendly and efficient, the sushi is decent, and the prices reasonable. Beer and wine only.- Greeted with two pieces of complimentary seared tuna salmon sushi while we read through the menu. I don't usually go for cooked sushi, but it was a nice gesture and actually quite good.The rolls are large with fresh fish and pretty purple rice. If not the best I've ever had, it could be because we chose poorly.- Harumi roll- love the crunch of tempura shrimp, stuffed with a lot of krab salad which was just ok.- H3 roll- this was my fave- spicy tuna and salmon, avocado, cuke, topped w/ eel sauce and spicy mayo- OMG roll- the server brings this foil wrapped package to the table and waves it over a flame a few minutes before opening. I like eel sauce, but this one was just too sweet for my taste.- Sashimi salad- good amount of tuna and salmon tossed with cucumber, avocado, and a bit of lettuce. Next time I would ask them to go light on the eel sauce.- Real wasabi- this was new to me, bright green and a bit slimy looking, it tasted pretty good.Overall, not a destination, but not a bad option if you're in the area and looking for affordable sushi."}, {"review_id": "jW-HwVy11QmOICXSaTVpCQ", "user_id": "Cp10iqqbOWOmzgW-EmrmaA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "Crack!!!! This place was one of my most favorite recent finds. Firstly let me say that I had no idea that \"black rice\" had so much going for it. They do a good job of not only advertising the black rice which is the Restaurants \"concept\" ingredient; but also of having information on the screens inside about some of its many benefits. As far as the sushi goes I ordered the Rainbow roll, Las Vegas roll(highlight), caterpillar roll, philly roll, Phoenix roll, and Gyoza.... everything was great.  I should add that I tend to order the same type of rolls everywhere I go and by comparison this was one of he best sushi spots I have tried. The fact that they use the black rice instead made a bit of an impact in that I thought the flavors on the philly roll were slightly over powering(still good tho) compared to a philly roll with standard white rice.  All and all I love concepts and this black rice with sushi concept was dead on. Can't wait to try this place again...service was great however their was a man who I'm guessing was the owner???...and he seemed to be very much so micro managing his staff. Yelling at them to do this or that from across the room. To the point that as a customer you noticed. Not okay bro!!!!! Other wise a nice small store front in down town Phoenix. Good food. Good Japanese beer. Great staff....except for that dude!!!!  Recommended."}, {"review_id": "MeWcV9Em1drYj6RhEt3CGQ", "user_id": "OuNHzBUaatejTsuhjMtnqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "This place is so yummy it makes me want to pull my phone out mid meal to type about it.

Started with the omakase, which is so reasonable for $35 (and that's coming from someone who eats sushi every time I go back to San Diego). All the selections were super fresh! I think it was some tuna that was SO mouthwatering and just melted in my mouth. OOH I also think it's so cool they use purple rice here! Got a taste of that in the H3 roll & the OMG roll. H3 was good, but the OMG roll was...OMG. If you love novelty rolls and exciting food - TRY THIS OMG ROLL!

I liked the appearance and taste of the rolls!  The purple rice was very soft but not sure if it really taste different than white rice.  I would need to try them side by side to tell any difference.  Best part was the fresh fish - definitely the freshest I've had in AZ.  The tuna was deep blood red and made me want it even though I don't usually go for tuna.  Crazy Roll - my favorite roll.  Soft, fresh, with soy paper. The Crunchy Mango roll and H3 roll - good but tasted similar and had spicy mayo and eel sauce overkill. Spider roll - disappointed as crab pieces so small you can barely taste it.Oasis roll - wrapped with cucumber and impossible to eat as a \"roll\" since it immediately falls apart. Taste only okay too.Nigiri - salmon, tuna, and yellowtail all amazing and fresh Seared salmon nigiri - YUM!  Had a great smokey taste and was compliments of the chef!Spicy scallop nigiri -  one large slice instead of mini scallops. Had fake crab on top (my pet peeve -__-).Chef also gave our toddler a plate of rice, fake crab, whipped cream, avocado, and cucumber to enjoy.Overall a good experience but wish they had yellowtail in their rolls. Will come back but order more sashimi vs rolls for the fresh fish."}, {"review_id": "qqZB8uA2c5FWkDYxzUn5CA", "user_id": "diYbASjeqV4CxkoyeBeBGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/11/2017", "text": "Oops, I forgot to review this! How could I forget to review such a memorable meal.I think that the waiter we had (Chef Juno) made the experience even more exceptional. His quips and antics made the meal even more enjoyable. The reason you go to Harumi Sushi is for the quality of the food, the variety of dishes, and the great taste. You will not be disappointed at all.We were lucky to have made a reservation as the place was packed. It is always a good idea to make reservations for dinner anywhere in the Phoenix metropolitan area on a Friday or Saturday night.You can definitely eat sushi cheaper elsewhere, but you will probably not enjoy the dining experience as much. This is definitely a restaurant that I will return to for more great sushi."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/harumi-sushi-phoenix?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
