The raw were also good, and at only 75 cents, a bargoon. The cocktails were strong and also good - the blackberry smash was my favorite, a bourbon based drink, and the ponchat cooler. Pretty popular place for HH so I think people fill it up near 3, and then there's a lull by 4:30 or so as the first wave stumbles back (to the office?)."}, {"review_id": "Cx5R5snuIi2UjflB8HFAGw", "user_id": "I7Fmd8WQA0FozWOEZQNdkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "This place is so cute ! We came here for brunch and could not wait to eat here. I got the shrimp and grits while the girls got a little bit of everything. Coffee was served is white teacups/saucer :) so cute! The shrimp and grits came in an iron skillet the grits were buttery and delicious. The shrimp were huge and seasoned well. What really made the dish was the sauce/gravy they smother the whole shrimp and grits with. So damn good!! I wish we had enough time to come back and do the lunch/dinner menu :) Next time I'm in NOLA I'm def.

So, it can be overwhelming to figure out where to go. I decided to try Luke based solely on Yelp reviews. Nothing overly distinctive about the decor. But there are wait staff in white coats. I felt like (and certainly looked like) an under-dressed tourist when I walked in and saw most tables occupied. I asked if I needed a reservation, and was promptly seated in the back part of the restaurant (which adjoins the lobby of the Hilton on St. Charles). It was happy hour, so I ordered Luke's signature French 45 -- champagne and fruit juice, it was quite delicious. A waitress brought over a small baguette wrapped in a towel -- warm -- with a metal bowl of soft whipped butter. So far, so amazeballs. Sadly, I am not too much of a seafood eater, so oysters are lost on me. My second waitress -- yes, I had two wait staff -- recommended shrimp and grits, with an addition of crawfish (currently in season). I also ordered a salad with buratta and grilled spring onions. The salad came with two slices of toasted bread, kale, onions and mushrooms tossed in a light vinagrette. The salad smelled heavenly and the cheese was meltingly soft and spreadable on the toasted bread. I really have no words to describe the shrimp and grits. I know that I will not have a dish like this anywhere else, ever again. Any other variation of shrimp and grits has to pale in comparison with what I ate at Luke. Smooth, cheesy, delectable grits. Huge, fresh, delicious shrimp. Butter. Chopped pieces of sausage. I didn't want it to end. There cannot be any greater compliment for a restaurant than for a patron to say they never wanted the food they served to end. The service was also top notch. Thoroughly enjoyable experience and highly recommended."}, {"review_id": "9TJKqwtSGiGexSjStmQ9vQ", "user_id": "_-Q9lDW-pZMR0C8Wg--giw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "This was one of my top meals in NOLA. There is a daily happy hour from 3-6 with 75 cent oysters (warning they are large oysters if you prefer small ones)! They have a great French 75 as well! A group of us of 8 went for dinner so we tried a large variety of items. The seafood tower was spendy but was so much food. Honestly, we could have been happy with that and not order anything else.Highlights of the meal were the duck duck rice with crispy rice - the crunch and flavors were spot on and jumbo Louisiana Shrimp en cocotte which was rich in flavor so best to get this and a something on the lighter side. The service was great - they were patient with us as we continued to order many drinks!

We came by around 4pm on a Monday afternoon, and there were maybe 3-5 parties seated in the restaurant and at the bar, combined. We chose seats at the bar, and after 5 min, we were given menus. We each ordered a GINTilly Lace ($6 - HH!) and for the two of us,  6 raw ($0.75 each) and 6 fried ($1.25 each) oysters. Since we were seated at the bar, we were able to watch the pros shucking oysters behind the bar.All of our food arrived in about 10 mins (raw ones almost immediately!), and the fried oysters were plated in an adorable tiny fryer basket. The fried oysters were flavorful and perfectly crispy, complimented by a dash of hot sauce and the creamy dipping sauce. The raw oysters were incredible! They were huge and plump and tasted so fresh (admittedly, I don't have much to compare to - the $3-5 ones in NYC have been teeny and bland). As filling as these were, we couldn't resist ordering more. We opted for 4 more of each, which kept me full for the next 7 hours! (This may have been a product of circumstance since I left Luke straight for the airport, and United did not serve any food on my flight back to NYC.)All in all, maybe one of my favorite happy hours I've ever been to! I definitely can't wait to come back! (Side note: by the time we left around 6pm, the restaurant was packed, and there was a line out the door.)FOOD: 5/5ENVIRONMENT: 4/5SERVICE: 4/5VALUE: 10/5OVERALL: 5/5P.S. I had been wanting to visit New Orleans for about 7 years now, and in that time, I had been following John Besh. I loved what he had done for the city and dreamt of coming to one of his restaurants. After the recent allegations, this image of him was obviously dimmed, but I figured Luke as a restaurant would still be the same place. So a little moral conflict in supporting his former restaurant group, but everyone working there still needs to work, I suppose."}, {"review_id": "B9QECcx9o4AoxSaukTWYqw", "user_id": "2B1x3wMVkSd_XozdPLXXWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Stumbled upon this on accident.

Salad was so damn fresh that I even ate the little cherry tomatoes- and I HATE those!!!I can just have a plate of the pickle beets and stuff myself on them alone for a meal!!! TO DIE FOR! I almost licked the bowl and still didn't feel \"bogged down\" or stuffed. I was very glad to see veggies added to the matzo soup. Almost like a chicken & veggies w matzo balls.

The fried oysters are really good too- crispy and super flavorful. They come with a spicy, creamy dipping sauce. The restaurant also offered half off of selected drinks including wine by the glass, draft beers, and cocktails. I got the Gintilly Lace cocktail. I wasn't a big fan of this cocktail because it was super strong for my taste. I could only finish half- but if you're into strong cocktails, this one is for you.

It ended being his favorite NOLA meal EVER.  Unfortunately, it set up all the other meals during our trip to be failures because he enjoyed it that much and was impressed by our waiter's knowledge of the vegan diet and how he worked with the kitchen to make my coworker happy. Thumbs up guy with the ponytail! (Sorry, didn't get your name.)We were so enablers by the service, that we hung out, ordered more drinks and dessert...forgetting our our urgency to make it to Bourbon Street for a fun night. Oops.Fast forward to Sunday Brunch.  Waiter seemed hungover and slow. Kept reaching over the table to serve drinks and fill our glasses.  Now, I've never been a server, but I am pretty sure that is incorrect etiquette.  And as much as I have been to Luke's, all other wait staff made this guy look like a chump.  Anyway, we kept trying to warm him up by being super polite and friendly, but it was more out of annoyance than anything...Food is always consistent here.  Although, I will say that the bacon bits in my salad seemed more fresh on Sunday morning than they did on Friday night.  I also love to get the shrimp and grits when I am feeling like something more hearty.

Glad we ended up here after the Ruby Slipper had an ungodly wait. Beautiful space and charismatic servers (thank you Jesse!) made the ambiance, despite being extremely hangry, very pleasant. The Brussels Sprouts were some of THE BEST we've ever had. Perfectly crispy, so flavorful and sweet and spicy, with a slightly creamy element in the barn cheese. They look crazy with the almonds, apple shreds, and jalapeño slices but the flavors are to-die-for. We soaked up the extra sauce with the complementary bread it was so good!  The burrata salad was delicious as well - light and zesty with some surprising spice in the pecans (they're dusted in Cajun seasoning, not candied!). Being a cheese fiend, the burrata-to-salad ratio was on point. The boyfriend had the pork schnitzel sandwich to which he said, \"I have never been humbled by a sandwich like this before\". \"It looked me in the eye and said, 'here's the door; you're not ready.'\"Jesse accurately said the servings are \"aggressively generous\". Something to keep in mind so you don't end up lugging half a pork schnitzel and fries around for hours on parade day!Fabulous food, fantastic service. 5/5 would recommend!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/luke-new-orleans-3?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
