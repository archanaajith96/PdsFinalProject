The food is absolutely delicious, top to bottom off the menus. All my family requests on Sunday is here! Mom loves biscuits & gravy! I'm a vegetarian that doesn't like egg so they make me an omelette off hash browns with cheese and a bunch of veggies I can never finish even though it's a half portion. The waffles are my fav when I have space or a sweet tooth. My love can't keep from special ordering a burger because they're too good! Then my dad usually sticks to the chorizo entrees because he loves that they offer it! Really can't go wrong on anything. Tip: skip the wait call ahead to go on a Sunday! They're so good it's busy the whole time they're open. I wasn't able to find any menus online so I decided to post them myself, hope it's useful!"}, {"review_id": "3uEZzXFnkeFLpYPoweZuAw", "user_id": "ZFMCV7aa-QKd2338kmNZQw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "Don't really understand the hype behind this place. This was my first time here, I really wanted to like it based off the 5 star reviews, but I'm just not feeling it. The outside appearance looks dated, mostly artificial lighting vs natural light (gives you that school cafeteria type of feel) & somewhat cramped. Being such a small & tight space it gets loud, especially when you have 4 kids running around and randomly screaming behind you... That's not the fault of the restaurant, but I felt like I was sitting at the Seahawks stadium with the whole \"12th man\" factor.Anyways, the service was friendly, but we had about 3-4 people come up to us, whether it was taking orders for drinks, food, delivering food, and checking back on us. When it was time to ask for the bill I wasn't sure who to stop and ask.The food was pretty good, just lacked a little extra flavor. I'm just being honest, there are better breakfast options in the nearby location. Maybe I'm not impressed as much as the others since I didn't eat here while growing up in the area, or maybe I just need to give this another shot and hope it's not as busy / loud as the last time.Overall, light 3. Definitely not the worst place I've had breakfast, but certainly not the 5 star experience like everyone previously mentioned."}, {"review_id": "konYQvQnh2cZ6xhdFGEZ5Q", "user_id": "Xz0zfaHuNMST1bOtz4m8lQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Breakfast and lunch only are served here.

I've only been twice but the first time definitely left an impression with how quick they were to get your order out. Everything was amazing! I would say I had asked my waiter for \"over medium\" eggs and definitely got eggs that were less than over easy so that's why I gave it 4 stars.

Well, that can't be good for a person's mental health. Thankfully I just now remembered that I've not reviewed one's of my favorite breakfast cafes! The food and staff are Five Star all the way. Many of the staff proudly wear T-shirts that show how many years they've worked at Express Cafe: 5 years, 10 years, 15 and more! That says a whole lot more about the quality and atmosphere of this establishment than my puny words can convey. We've eaten at Express Cafe several times, always a satisfying experience. We've consistently been greeted at the door by a cheerful host, wait times have been minimal, servers friendly and prompt, and food delicious and copious. Saturday mornings are very busy for them, so expect to be given a pager and wait for 10 minutes or so. But the wait is SO worth it. It's all good, but my favorite is biscuits and gravy, eggs over easy, hash browns and sausage, and great coffee."}, {"review_id": "yogKGfZCgllQYQlPLXEdnQ", "user_id": "P8khypZoqTZCIPTcCEt4Sw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "Arrived in a Sunday for brunch & for two people, we waited less than five minutes.

So is Del Posto.  This is not that.  But it is good food for what it is.There may be reasons some people have better palates or food instincts than others.  But age isn't the deciding factor.Still, this isn't a hipster hangout.  So if that's a factor for you, there you go.  Go find one.Otherwise, set pretension aside here and enjoy it for what it is.  You won't find emu egg omelettes or mimosas served six ways or single grower coffee.  You will find \"we're glad you came\" service and good home cookin'.  Like Daily brand lean, perfectly cooked bacon, super hash browns, eggs served lots of different ways. pancakes, waffles...and on the days when Eggs Benedict is on the specials board you can even order a half portion if you ask.LOCALSI'd wager nearly all of the diners packing the place for breakfast on a weekday morning were  local.BREAKFAST & LUNCH BOTH SERVED ALL DAYI doubt I'll need that lunch menu with breakfast available all times.  But one never knows.  If I live long enough, maybe I will.THIS N THAT:1)  PARKING:  Private lot.2) ACCESSIBILITY:  One non van accessible parking space in the front lot.  Van acessible space in side lot.  Level in, all one one floor.  Standard height tables.  Women's loo is accessible but not men's...says my hubby re the latter.  The ladies' can be used by gents who are disabled if they need accessible loo.3) CROWDS:  Lines out the door on weekends.  Weekday breakfast time slows down a bit depending on day of the week but seems 10:30ish is a good bet time to get a table or better yet a booth!"}, {"review_id": "_wmTQPidi9D3m0X0dqZCYQ", "user_id": "ypRJ5E7XYTexT5p9aK2ySg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/6/2016", "text": "Truly one of the best breakfast joints in the Treasure Valley!   Generous portions and super friendly and efficient staff.

Certainly share-able for normal eaters. You can't find larger orders of hash browns or country potatoes than here. The fact that they have shredded hash browns is a plus in my book. And their Belgian Waffle are CRISP, not soggy like some places, is also a home run.Jammed at weekends, so we go on weekdays when the crowds taper down.Why not 5 stars? As before, they serve (UGH) Farmer Bros. coffee. Weak, Weak, and no body, need I say more. I still haven't tried bringing in an outside coffee to drink with breakfast. Will they throw me out?

I have been meaning to write a review since our first visit about four months ago. Since then we have been back 7-8 times, for breakfast and for lunch, weekday and weekends, with the kids and without. We've gotten a pretty good idea of the overall business!The people here are fantastic. Always so pleasant, very helpful, patient when we have the two kids with us, willing to work with us on orders if needed (we have a couple allergies and they never even bat an eye, just offer helpful options). They remember our drink preferences and move quickly without ever hurrying us. They wear shirts that show length of service for each employee and it is so lively to see the long term of the staff, and the awesome mix of people! Truly one of the best mixes of staff that are ALL sweet and helpful and GOOD at what they are doing. Food... the only thing I have not been a fan of is the omelets. We don't do pork or beef, so the omelets are a bit more limited to the veggie omelet for us (they don't have a chicken or turkey sausage or bacon option sadly!) and each time it has been a bit different and a bit disappointing. With spinach it was super watery, without it the veggies were just raw tossed on top, one time the veggies were all soft except for the onions which were totally raw. I finally had to give up and just order eggs. All the rest of the breakfast items are delicious (I adore the basic awesome hash browns! The country potatoes are basically just short fries but they are good too lol, just need some more seasoning!). The sandwiches we've gotten have all been great and the steak fries our the family choice although the seasoned fries are delicious. Don't come here for a \"health\" meal, although you can order decently healthy options. This is a small, local diner (gets packed for breakfast, much slower for lunch and they close early so check the time!) and the food fits the atmosphere: smart, simple, well done and welcoming!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/express-cafe-meridian?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
