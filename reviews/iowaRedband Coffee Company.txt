I'm sure the beans are great, but every time I've purchased a drip coffee or latte from Red Band I've been disappointed. The drip is super acidic and the least bit tast. My vanilla latte two weeks ago was delicious, but with 3 espresso shots I was expecting a much larger caffeine buzz! Which I needed because I was on my way to work. Definitely not worth SIX DOLLARS!0 stars for the Coffee, 2 stars for their delicious breakfast sandwiches.

Thick and savory, this massive morning bite will melt in your mouth.  All ingredients are fresh and whole, and you watch them assemble it so you know it's not some frozen to microwave kind of deal. Located in the downtown area, this is a great convenient stop if you're passing through, heading to work, or hitting up the weekend markets. It's a must try!"}, {"review_id": "g8Tn1yMrq26OuRX7qNZZNg", "user_id": "YE1c9UALG1LjArNj-Xz3Hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "So friendly!

Listen, if you appreciate really good coffee this is the place. I've had coffee in a lot of joints around the US and EU and this place's espresso ranks in the top three for sure and is by far the best coffee and espresso in the QCA. The scones with the pecans, fantastic. Cookies, delicious AF. The service, listen I know this is Iowa and some people expect to be on a first name basis with everyone and have 20 minute conversations about people's dogs and kids and all sorts of biznass, but they balance efficiency and speed with a very friendly environment. I don't know everyone's name and I don't need to. I know the two girls with glasses, the guys with glasses and the guy with a beard and the guy that wears flannel some times are going to make me a wonderful drink and be put out very kind vibes while doing so. Cheers to Redband, if you haven't been here yet you're crazy. Even if you don't drink coffee, just got get a cup of water, smell the tremendous aromas and take in the uplifting vibe."}, {"review_id": "FjI98PdMxw0XZ0ON_hdPIA", "user_id": "o1D-O82erd0NMj7bRuRb7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "Young people in small business letting their passion for life shine through..pure American bliss"}, {"review_id": "7KMpLkZ1AXxK1y55wn5zFg", "user_id": "4TdXVJuIMsEHQkO-BuPYkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/7/2017", "text": "Excellent coffee.

I walked here with the dog to get a coffee and try an egg sandwich that people seem to rave about. The service is hip and cool, but chilly. Not super friendly like I have come to expect in Davenport. The coffee is pretty good! I did enjoy that. The egg sandwich is a pre-cooked sandwich that is wrapped up and reheated. This was fine as it was real quick to order at the window. When I got home, I tried the sandwich, but was really disappointed since it was VERY heavy handed on the pepper. I like seasoning, but this was way overkill. I was disappointed that I paid almost $5 for a peppered egg sandwich that was relatively bland otherwise. Live and learn! Still on the hunt for the perfect combo of friendly, warm service and a delicious coffee shop I can walk to with my dog. Hope to find soon."}, {"review_id": "j-ZfoHGvvBqLz7ip_cqrRw", "user_id": "EeQHrDosMk-ZJ_6_5PazCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "The drip coffee and the pour overs are the best coffee I've ever had - in any city.

The best part? These folks aren't just brewing damn good coffee, they're roasting it too. This Hilltop location is extra hip as they've embraced the 50's style architecture of their building. It is true that they don't have seating which was a bit of a bummer, even a single table for two or small tables outside would have been adequate to soak up their vibes before hitting the road again. Rumor has it, they have a second location in downtown Davenport and I'll inevitably check it out the next time I'm passing through to Chicago."}, {"review_id": "EyxZq886GOFWsxbGqO-JKA", "user_id": "xgflRE6b-_I0apZgmXLZJQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/30/2016", "text": "Redband Coffee Company seems to be the the local favorite in Davenport.

I hadn't been there for a while but remembered how delish the Iced New Orleans Coffee is!!! And for sure it didn't disappoint. Great tasting coffee laced with brown sugar and milk. It's very smooth and the best around, hands down to other iced caffeine drinks. Hubby had a mocha which he enjoyed. It was just the right temperature and again liked it better than other brews he has had. Drive through is easy but you will need to wait a bit while they craft your drink.
