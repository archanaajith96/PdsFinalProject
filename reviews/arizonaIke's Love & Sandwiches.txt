Arrived at 11:45 for a Wednesday lunch and there were 8 in line in front of me. The line took 12 mins. I ordered the 504 Thunderbird which is only available in Mesa. It had pastrami, thunderbird sauce and smoked Gouda on a Dutch Crunch roll (my choice of five breads) for $9.99 plus tax. My lunch was ready in nine minutes because they make every sandwich to order. The bread was soft on the inside yet with a delicious crunch to the crust. The meat was plentiful and cooked properly.  The sauce was just the right touch: moist but not sloppy. The smoked Gouda was a very nice touch. Add in the fresh veggies and you've a winner."}, {"review_id": "e02NeeQ0F28K75dIJsReOw", "user_id": "6ZE7J9WIwBDnc4gHZxHxnw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "You're trying to go here for a sandwich? REALLY?! A sandwich you can make at home? Are you SERIOUS?! ... Well get serious,because you should DEFINITELY should go here to get a sandwich here's why as you keep reading. First & foremost this location is on a corner of a strip mall, nice big sign that you can see, indoor & out door seating are an option here. (who doesn't like to eat outside)Area: The atmosphere is relaxed, bursting with surprising tunes that just had everyone in the store jamming. When we entered it was no customers but one family already eating, unfortunately for some reason the tables were STILL dirty. When no customers are available, that is the time to set up your shop in a cleaner manner. That was disappointing to me & it shows they don't care about the appearance where the customers eat. Makes you wonder do they care about the area in which they are preparing the food. Seating was nice, booths and tables for two are available.  Food: Two Matt Cains were ordered, and one side drink, and one bag of chips. Another free bag came with a Yelp coupon.  (TIP OF THE DAY) The food was absolutely GREAT and well prepared (How can you mess up a sandwich). The combination of flavors are so perfectly meshed together, it's unbelievable how good this sandwich was & I want one just thinking about it. Service: the man at the counter was 5 star rating in my opinion he loves his job and you won't leave the counter without him adding his input to make sure you get what your taste buds crave. He was definitely apart of the experience and a great addition to this place. I really want to give this place 5 stars because the food was just excellent, but unfortunately the price was ridiculous. My ending bill was over 20 bucks, sure multiple meats were involved and my sandwich was warm  but to me personally it doesn't warrant the price. Especially if you're buying separate drinks, you're just buying a sandwich. I'm from Chicago where GREAT sandwich's come with great buying value that includes something extra such as maybe one bag of chips or a pop. EVERYTHING here had to be purchased separately, the chips(which were bomb) & a beverage. To me personally, that is just not consumer friendly. Cleanliness, price and value warrants my rating. I recommend going here, it's worth the bite."}, {"review_id": "rpo6srh-FzxOTNj7YIWB_A", "user_id": "8fRDmeri7UgTO5JEP5vhlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "The menu is really puzzling with toooo many sandwiches of all combinations of meat, cheese and veges.

Staff was very friendly and efficient. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted so after much deliberation, I decided I was going to order the Matt Cain which comes with roast beef, turkey, salami, godfather sauce and provolone. It was tasty. I could've gone without the the Godfather sauce though. Bread was great.If you check-in you get a free bag of Zapp's chips. The Hotter n' Hot Jalapeño flavor is very good.

They have hundreds of different sandwich options. There is something for Vegans, Vegetarians and Meat Eaters. The food is delicious. We've tried about six sandwiches so far. They all have great flavor. Nice portion sizes. The breads are always fresh. They have managed to make vegan and vegetarian sandwiches so great even meat eaters are ordering them. The staff is friendly and willing to suggest different options. They allow you to customize each sandwich so you get exactly what you want. The dining area is clean. The restrooms are clean and they give you a lollipop with each order. I highly suggest you check this place out. You can thank me later. Oh and free bag of chips for Yelpers upon check in."}, {"review_id": "_ISei140JP9aV4jQt-YBAA", "user_id": "T1TI-1x4TJB7V-nJhaP_NA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "We stopped by here on the way to our gym. I've only been here a couple times and I can't remember what I ordered in the past. This time I ordered the Tony soprano. The Sandwich comes with salami, ham, turkey, Italian dressing, provolone cheese and it's under nine dollars. We ordered it on the Dutch crunch bread. It was amazingly delicious and comes toasted.  It also comes with their garlic dairy free sauce and is called the dirty sauce, along with lettuce and tomato. We decided to split a sandwich because we didn't want to be too full before working out. It was perfect for two people, we were not starving however and we also got a bag of chips because we checked in through Yelp. They also give you two lollipops for free, cute!"}, {"review_id": "tNlt41kNegBvblkzQYS2Jw", "user_id": "DI_bOKy--LGZMFB8uK7WfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "My 3 year old asked if they had marshmallows and lo and behold they had marshmallow fluff. My husband got the Randy Hahn. He said it was good, but nothing to write home about. I got the Madison Bumgarner with lettuce and tomato.

I came in to try the place out for the first time and almost walked out when I saw the prices. I decided to stay and spend a few dollars extra just to try it out, and it was good but still not worth the price. After spending a good 10 minutes looking over their massive menu and deciding what I wanted, I was informed that they were all out of the halal chicken (which ruled out all of the sandwiches that I had been interested in). I ended up going with the Matt Cain at the recommendation of the employee, which came out to a total of $12 JUST for the sandwich! That didn't even include a side or a drink or anything. TBH I know I'm getting old and I have to frequently remind myself that it's not the 90's anymore when you could get a full meal at any fast food place for $5 but damn, $12 is waaaaaay too much for one sandwich even in 2018."}, {"review_id": "YZIZeuY0VloE8bRpK9lz5A", "user_id": "h1ovyYne78jKZPo8gFVM8g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2017", "text": "After sampling Ike's sandwiches at different events, I decided to give the shop a try. I am torn on my review. The food quality, while messy, was very good, but the service was below average.I got in line behind three people. It did not take long for someone to take my order, but it did take almost 20 minutes to deliver my sandwich. I only had 30 minutes for lunch, so this left me pressed for time. They only had one person running orders from the kitchen, and he was also the only one running the cash register. It was very inefficient. I think I will skip returning to this location. Especially during the lunch hour.Also, they were out of bacon. What kind of sandwich/breakfast so runs out of bacon before noon?!"}, {"review_id": "vXlFvuYfOoLKGRviNqopxA", "user_id": "HlfTjDGNqwyQcY049jKNrw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "I was a first time visitor today, and I have to say this place did not disappoint!

I had the Julius Ceasar, and thought that it was very tasty. I think that the sandwich tasted better because of the ceasar dressing. Without the ceasar dressing it might have been a bit plain, but they have more flavorful sandwiches on the menu that I could have selected. The sandwich seems a bit pricey because usually there are quite a few sandwich places that seem to be $5, but I really thought that their bread was good, the ceasar dressing was nice, and the sandwich was well-made. They also gave me an apple caramel lollipop too, which I thought was a nice touch."}, {"review_id": "QxaAjUDFqBnM2oeXH-8p9g", "user_id": "lqLWDyRofj2ddGxQSPfQ_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Usually the subs are a good size.
