Easy decision. Speaking of food, the rib meat just falls off the bone, the chicken is moist and the baked beans can be a meal by themselves.  The \"to go\" team is great. They first present your order before bagging it up so nothing is forgotten. Then they describe the BBQ sauces so you know what to expect when you get home. And they do it all with a smile and a few jokes."}, {"review_id": "CDdUf_1s82307AKJtiSeRg", "user_id": "g-cGhCYwQ0azyPqNBbT1nA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "This was probably the most surprising outcome of our KC BBQ trip and not in a good way.A little over a year before our most recent visit we had gone to the original Q39.  That was the one of the best experiences we had at any BBQ in the country, where we ended up going back a second time on that trip.  We were staying closer to Q39 South so decided to go there this time.  I couldn't believe it was the same place.  The two trips to the original Q39 I left saying those were the best burnt ends I ever had in my life.  This time, they were close to the worst ones I ever had.  They were so thin and even then were really fatty in not the good way.  I don't know if was just a fluke or if the quality is really that much worse here but it left me really disappointed.  One the plus side the jalapeno sausage was good, could tell it was made in house and not mass produced.I would definitely recommend the original location but do have mixed feelings about this location.  You should always be concerned about quality dropping at expanded locations.  Would need to give this place another try though before making that declaration."}, {"review_id": "w6nOc-heE9JPSZd38BXxAA", "user_id": "FXnHfE2PNKnc9zvkKkwDdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "OMG!

Let's just say I dug into my plate and forgot to take a picture so I just walked up to the chefs window and took a couple of snaps.I also have to mention are awesome waitress. She was very knowledgeable and directed us in the right direction so that we could get a sample of everything.

Each of their different meats is absolutely top notch. You can't go wrong. I have been able to go to both the original location downtown and the newer south location and have found an impressive attention to detail and ensuring a standard product across all locations. My personal favorite dish is the Q Spare Ribs, which have a nice sweet sauce coating and fall off the bone meat, all packed with a tremendous amount of smoky flavor. Getting hungry again just thinking about it. One tip: make sure to get reservations if possible because they fill up quite fast, especially on the weekends. Otherwise, it's not out of the ordinary to expect an hour or 2 wait. But if you are trying to find some of the best BBQ in the country, the wait is worth every second."}, {"review_id": "oD4oiqDdZdEpw63hftzXgw", "user_id": "Wmsm5HOO-hZO9Js3umWL3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "This place is tied for the best BBQ in town (Joe's) Make sure to get your reservations made if you plan on going for dinner or have a big crowd.While it's not the most exotic thing to get, their chicken is amazing.

Being a non-meat eater, I am just a sidekick for the rest of them, eating side dishes for dinner. Not the case at Q39. They have a really nice vegetarian option. I had the veggie patty. It is a homemade chickpea patty that comes with nice fresh bun, slice of cheese and fried onions. The side of BBQ sauce was a perfect match.  The fries and slaw were a nice complement. The others had the ribs, brisket and sausage.  They commented the flavor was very nice and not overly saucy.  Each piece was tender and moist. Ribs came off the bone.  Service was fairly attentive and polite.  Could have been a little more cognitive to details. Messed up a few drinks and meal items. Nice BBQ.

My coworkers took me here to experience KC barbecue, and I left stuffed!

The wait was worth it though, since the burger I got was really flavorful and filling. The onion strings inside the burger gave it a nice crisp, and the meat was nice and tender.I couldn't even finish the fries that I got, and had to beg the rest of my table to help me finish it.

I was not disappointed. Although we were staying downtown, I wanted to try the Overland Park (South) location so we ventured there to have some dinner with friends. The parking lot was packed at 6:30pm and I could easily see that there was going to be a decent wait for the 4 of us to get a table. I was quoted 30 mins for a table but got taken back within 15-20. Thumbs up! Under promise and over deliver is the way to go with customer service. We wanted to try all the items so did a various mix of ribs, burnt ends, brisket and sides. The ribs + brisket is the best I have had and match my tastes perfectly for bbq. Tender, juicy meat that falls off the bone and is not too sauced up or salty. Perfection in BBQ for my tastes. I don't like to get caught up in all the sauces and variations that some places do- I just want simple-great smoked meat, and that is what you get here. Drinks were typical at ~$10/each and I thought they were done well. I would highly recommend the ribs and brisket here.

Now my first choice and that is saying something. Previously, I went three different places for 'the best' burnt ends, brisket and pulled pork. Now, with Q39 on the scene, one place fits the bill for all three items along with offering delicious beans and coleslaw. The meat is what makes this place's barbecue phenomenal. It's not the huge portions, (because they're not) or the interior of the place. It's the meat. Beyond delicious - flavorful, juicy, smokey.... oh my, can't wait to get back! The burger topped with burnt ends is delicious too.

The meat literally fell off the bone the meat I started eating it with my fork, but I went all in and picked that bad boy up and ate it!(My mouth is getting watery from remembering this piece of meat).

A MUST when I'm back in town, no matter the restaurant, I gotta have my KC BBQ at least once.I didn't want to try it at first, because KC Joe's already had my heart and Jack Stack was my side chick. Well, I had heard this was a new location for Q39 in OP, so I made my way on a Friday evening.  Boyyyy was it packed, we had a party of 3 and had to wait at least 15-20 minutes.PIT MASTER BRISKET ($9.5): If you like KC Joe's Z-Man like I do, you gotta try Q39's Pit Master Brisket burger. O M G. Q39 has these small spiced onion straws that are strangely addicting, compared to KC Joe's Z-Man having one huge onion ring. Brisket, was soooosoooooooo tender. Their \"classic sauce\" was basic for sure, but required to fully enjoy your brisket burger.Q SPARE RIBS ($19 half/$29 full rack): I feel like a broken record. These ribs were deeeeelicious. So tender, so juicy. Comes with cole slaw and beans or potato salad or fries (+$1). We went with the fries and cole slaw :). (I thought maybe that the fries that came with the ribs would be smaller than ordering an extra order of a side of fries, but they're actually the same size!)APPLE COLESLAW ($3): Crunchy, fresh, delicious! The apples in the cole slaw add a very nice sweet touch. Cole slaw is a must for me when I'm eating bbq. Nomnomnom.HOUSE-CUT FRIES($4): Scrumptious, nicely browned, not too thick and not too thin classic fries. Not your classic ketchup is here but their chipotle ketchup (yum!).DRINKS: Q39 has an extensive drink menu, likely with whatever you could be looking for. Cocktails, beers, wines, Q39's got it.SERVICE: Very good, there was this man I believe was the manager(?) that checked in on us, making small talk, if we were in school, yadda yadda. Our server was also quite nice, being prompt and kind.If you're looking for the \"BEST\" Barbeque in Kansas City, well, I don't think there is one. You'll just have to try it at the number of places that KC has to offer.. muahaha. I think wherever you end up in KC for bbq, your tastebuds will be satisfied no matter what. At each of the different BBQ spots, their sides may be what makes them stand out, but as for briskets and ribs, you shouldn't be disappointed. Now when I have friends or family visiting from out of town, I'm gonna have a hard time choosing where to take them.."}, {"review_id": "oFoxgezMYJf1A5kEPBRGNg", "user_id": "LgEuO98woFkPdNmd0-4w1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Pretty Solid bbq.7/5 The appetizer wings are truly incredible, unbelievably moist and packed with flavor that's sweet yet tangy sauce. 6/5 The onion fries were another smash hit!

(Don't think of this as an arbitrary award of stars.) Seriously, my wife and I have become addicted. I'm sure this is a benign use of the term considering...but seriously...we are.What I'm about to share isn't from a dinner time experience. We've only indulged during lunch/afternoon periods, but 'seriously'...!We've settled upon two major dishes although we've enjoyed every single one we've ordered here in the accumulated visits. These are OUR staples: BEST Wings on the Planet: These large 6x portions are served 3 drummies and 3 wing sections. These are slow cooked, smoked, then lightly grilled over a long period of time--yielding well cooked, flavored wings with the fats largely melted out. Then capped in the oven with a delightful fresh chipotle BBQ sauce. NOW--the sauce turns out to be a secret competition sauce that isn't even available to take out in a to-go container because it's made with fresh ingredients daily.You can only taste this treat in-house. Delightful though!!! Addicting!Combo Plate (Pick 2): This dish is enough for my wife and I to split for lunch. What a plate of wonder! You'll get to choose two items. Admittedly, we are stuck on the two St. Louis cut ribs--melted meat richness that still holds it's meat-tension while waiting to relax in your mouth; The Brisket slices are usually the size of the diameter of the serving plate. Smooth, smokey and moist after hours upon hours under masterful care. You can choose a side (usually fries extra crispy for us) but there are other choices.In fact, we usually add to our order, the White Bean Cassoulet. The beans are selected, and soaked overnight before being baked a full day with Sausage, onion, tomato and thyme...(I'm not particularly a bean-dish guy) but really exceptional. Q39 spiced onion straws:  OK it's a guilty pleasure. This plate is not expensive and is a huge portion!!! Lightly breaded onion slices served with a chipotle BBQ sauce, a most delightful dish to linger over!!!Cap all of this off with a restrained but wide-ranging and engaging selection of craft and interesting brews, and you have the recipe for a fine visit and memorable eating.For convenience, use the Yelp reservation button on their Yelp site to secure your table. At this spot--you'll need a reservation, or time to wait, most every day. You'll soon learn: Addicting!!!

Q39 has consistently been delicious every time I visit, regardless of location, and is without question the premier location for excellent BBQ. If you're like me, you didn't grow up in Kansas City. Therefore, whenever a family member comes into town (often) they want to know where to get the best KC BBQ. I don't pollute their minds with my opinion, instead I take them to a variety of BBQ joints in the city and let them decide. After many trials, the results have been overwhelmingly unanimous: Q39 takes home the blue ribbon for best BBQ - an impressive feat in a city full of great BBQ. I cannot say enough about this restaurant. I've enjoyed a large portion of their menu and can honestly say each item that I have tried can stand alone and get 5/5 Stars ... EVERY item. I've had the spiced onion straws w bbq aioli, pork belly and sausage corn dogs, triple threat, mr. Burns, burnt end burger, jumbo beef short rib (exceptional), 2 and 3 meat combo, spare ribs, pulled pork, and the angus beef brisket.I'd highly recommend this place as your first and last stop when visiting KC.
