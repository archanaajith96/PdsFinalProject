I'd been to the old Melt both in person and for take-out and loved both. This was my first time at the new location.My sister and I walked in and there were two women waiting to be seated ahead of us; a group of 4 guys who I assume were in a band because there is no other reason to look like you fell out of a bad 80's movie, pushed past us and the other two women to go greet their girl who was a bartender or hostess, I'm not sure and immediately sat down.After waiting a few more minutes my sister and I were taken to a table. Our server greeted us and took our order quickly but it was a good 20-30 minutes before our sandwiches came to the table. First, my open-faced, flat-bread sandwich was a pizza. Call it a pizza. It was edible but needed a lot of salt and pepper and isn't something I'd order again. Previously I'd ADORED it.For a place known for it's flavourful food, everything was insanely bland. My sister got the kraut for her Rachel on the side and I gave it a try--it literally tasted of nothing. I did not know that was even possible for sauerkraut. It didn't taste like any slaw or pickle or kraut. She also had to salt her side of mac and cheese which wasn't creamy or cheesy, but dry. She left most of her sandwich as it again was bland and dry.When our food came we'd asked our server if we could have our checks because it was lunch time and we needed to go and she sort of just sighed as if to say, yea I know it's really slow I'm sorry.The server was very nice and I can't fault her for anything, but the food was not worth coming back for at all. It's a shame because it was a funky little place with good food. Based on our experience, I can't see us going back anytime soon. I hate writing bad reviews, but it was bad."}, {"review_id": "Z6iXYfg20w3v1ZVvGRpkCg", "user_id": "WEKc2TqlnMX6lgaB5aPySA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I haven't been back to Melt in years, since before they moved to their new location. I finally went back yesterday for lunch, and I'm glad I did because the service and speed has greatly improved! I'll be adding this back into the usual lunch rotation.The new location is super cute and very on-brand for Molly Wellmann. Mod, colorful, and eclectic. I kind of liked it when they were in an old Northside building with the back patio, but this new location is nice as well. They even have someone to greet you at the door and a bar area. I haven't tried any of their cocktails, but I'll be coming back for that later!Their half sandwich, half soup special for $12 is a really great deal. I left feeling really full and like I got a good value for my money. The soup yesterday was a corn chowder, which was delicious and fresh. The verde chicken sandwich I got with it was the bomb! I like that they have quite a few meat options on the menu now for meat eaters. The buffalo cauliflower were also good, and I think even my carnivore husband would love these as an alternative to buffalo wings!Overall, a fantastic lunch stop with great service. I can't wait to come back for happy hour or dinner."}, {"review_id": "AjUqZbDeTT62rOeVU46L8w", "user_id": "jv7eIqEoEPBXVhcJoYwmyw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Was passing through Cinci for our trip and was looking for something somewhat quick and healthy. Melt met both of those. Food was good, wasn't anything to get super excited about. However I must say- the mushroom soup that came highly recommended by our server was delicious! One of the best I've had (and I love mushroom soup). Mac and cheese was just ok, sort of dry. Server was super friendly and gave us good recommendations for our lunch.

It was a pretty quick lunch, but I'm impressed, and I will be back!The place is really nice on the inside, very cozy yet modern. The color scheme is lots of cool calming blues and greens. Everything is very clean and bright. Everything was very casual, you can see some of the kitchen peeking out and I saw the cook talking over supply orders or something with our waiter. The girls at the bar seemed very friendly and we're chatting without being loud. You feel like you're in someone's home...I guess if someone lived in a fast casual restaurant.We came in and we're greeted instantly by a friendly gentleman. He was very accommodating when my coworker asked for a bigger table for her portfolio. He also took our orders and brought us our food. He was very polite and attentive. I like the menu size, it wasn't too fussy, but you still had great choices. I'm in love with their side choices btw! Side of hummus and chips, yes please!! Their cocktails sounded so good, but I sadly could not partake as I was working! Next time I come I'm definitely getting a fizzy whatever it was with the tequila.The food is so fresh and very good. I got the Pad Thai wrap with tofu and a side of red pepper hummus and tortilla chips. I don't think I've ever had a better hummus. It was light and fresh and the perfect balance of flavors. The wrap was great! The tofu is a generous portion, and cooked perfectly. That peanut sauce I'm there is great, and it had plenty of sprouts and cilantro too I'm pretty certain. My coworker had the black bean vegetarian chili, and she loved it. It looked amazing, and they really give good portions here too!I'm coming back as soon as I can!"}, {"review_id": "SDt9SZ695mKuWHhYAaWGwg", "user_id": "iZ7S0EqR0kzSHkgOJIHDCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "I stopped in here for lunch with my family after spending the morning at the zoo. It's about 7 minutes from there. I love trying new places and a friend told me it was a healthier restaurant. We were seated promptly and our server was very attentive. We ordered the kids grilled cheese sandwiches,  I ordered the pad Thai wrap and hubby ordered the avocado wrap. When the grilled cheese came out, my kids were perplexed that it had white cheese. When the server came to check on us, my 5 year old blurted that he wanted yellow cheese. I told her it was fine, but she insisted on having a yellow cheese sandwich made. It was really sweet and above and beyond. My kids enjoyed the chips and fruit, but they struggled with the sourdough bread on the grilled cheese because it was very chewy and tougher, which is the nature of sourdough. I tried it and it was delicious. However, I would recommend using a different bread that is easier for kids to eat. My pad thai wrap was delicious and I had it with the yummy vegan chili. I tried the avocado wrap too and it was good. Everything was fresh and excellent. I would definitely go here again and recommend it to anyone.

The location is smack dab in the heart of Northside. Parking is either on street or private lot. The new space is much larger and comfortable than the former location but does lack the personality and charm and the really cool back patio. There are a few outdoor tables but its right by the busy intersection and bus stop so it's not an ideal scenario. Price wise, I'd say it is on par with most restaurants. The food quality was fine, nothing superior or exemplary, and the sandwich I had was ok and my wife's chili I sampled was good.Overall, I would go back but I am not going to make it a priority. The drink menu looked really nice so maybe I will have something form that next time."}, {"review_id": "IaQFmMVaW5UsmPQOo24erQ", "user_id": "VT8rJB-ftikcxIikwSVCJQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "I wanted to give this place a higher review but unfortunately I was disappointed with my visit to the new location.

She is a powerhouse of positive energy and seems to be having fun pretty much all the time. If you are lucky enough to be in one of her establishments when she is around, she is going to be super helpful and will probably offer a lesson on one of her featured cocktails. She usually hits it out of the park with all of her places- but then there is Melt. Melt was a Northside institution. It was a funky hole in the wall with rustic patio. The food was always good and affordable. I was excited to see it move to a new location and finally was able to stop in last week. It was a beautiful day and we sat down near the bathrooms and decided the only really comfortable place was at the end of the bar by the windows. The decor is absolutely horrendous. It looks like a building supply salvage yard exploded. The colors are uncomfortable and it while it was going for the shabby chic look, it is just tacky and jarring. This is all shocking to me as it is new construction and they had the chance at something pleasant. They could have kept the feel of the old Melt everyone grew to love, but cleaned and classed it up a bit. They serve food, so I should talk about that. Laura had a salad which was very good. I had a pad thai  tofu sandwich. I thought it was delicious. All the ingredients felt fresh and tasty. The Mac and cheese was quite good, but maybe could have uses a bit of flavor. I am often complaining about there being too much salt in the food, but I think maybe the mac could have used a bit. Over all, for what we had, I was surprised at how much the bill was. The food is quite expensive for what it is. I will probably go back, but only if I can sit by the window so I can look away from the interior and only occasionally when I am willing to splurge on a sandwich."}, {"review_id": "YsgS_Sgu3MDnPIAeK5No-Q", "user_id": "kjufmO1Dpkv0xvbFULmmQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "My coworkers and I have been waiting for this establishment to open.

There was a wait as we expected but once a bar seat opened, we were in it! Molly was behind the bar as friendly and outgoing as ever. I ordered the Blue Bell one of Molly's signature cocktails. A very light drink that tasted amazing! If you haven't frequented one of Molly's establishments I suggest you do now. She is Cincinnati's top mixologist and an all around amazing person to be around. Her drinks are like no other and there is almost always a story behind them! I ordered the apple/beet salad and loved every bite. The place was very quaint and I loved the set up. The back had separate unisex bathroom doors so it's nice for that privacy sometimes in a restaurant. The tables were very open and inviting and loved how the bar was situated as you walked in so you could just have a drink without entering the restaurant itself.

I had postponed visiting once they reopened, because I wanted them to have a chance to get the kinks out and settle in to their new location. However, the constant stream of so-so reviews left me wandering if it was worth trying. But I decided to anyway at 2:30 on a Wednesday afternoon.I waited until later to intentionally avoid the lunch rush and having to wait for a table. I walked in to order to go and the place was nearly empty. I told the hostess I wanted to place a to-go order, so she took it for me and told me I could wait at the bar and pay there. Perfect.Apparently this is not standard protocol and I should have ordered at the bar. No big deal, except that it ended up messing up my order (I asked to substitute tofu for chicken, and swap the cheese), but when my bill came they were written as add-ons. Not a huge deal. The lady behind the bar double checked on everything for me and we got it cleared up before my wrap came out with both tofu and chick, and two types of cheese. Stuff happens, so not the end of the world, and I appreciated them making sure everything was right.The wait itself wasn't bad. Like many have noted, the vibe of \"New Melt\" is not the cozy, comfy, cramped nook like \"Old Melt\" but I found it to be warm and inviting. The bar is nice and they have a good selection of alcohol (because of course, Molly). The food itself was... disappointing. I went with the avocado wrap for $11. And it was just bleh. Being that it is an avocado wrap, I assumed the fact that it didn't come with a sauce on it would be made up for copious amounts of avocado. GUYS, I HAD ONE SMALL SLICE.  There was hardly any on it (and yes, I know, supplies are currently low and harder to come by... but it's on the menu). Like to avocado, there was hardly any cheese. The chicken was coooold. Like it had been sitting in a fridge for hours. And the whole thing was overpowered by how much kale they had packed into it. Overall, the wrap was small, dry, and not quite what the menu would suggest. For $11 I feel like I overpaid for what ultimately a chicken and kale wrap.I want to love \"New Melt,\" I really do. I'm hoping I can be talked into giving it another try, and I hope that I'm wrong and this experience was just a lousy one. But with all the other similar reviews, I'm not so sure. I feel like something has been lost in the mix."}, {"review_id": "CoKGcmX5zceXNV-Z2tqhqw", "user_id": "W9qZHec23yJRFf_R91o0TA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "Okay- this is the first time I've been to the new Melt since the old one closed about (what seems) 30 years ago. Gone is the backyard patio furniture in the back of the restaurant, past the kitchen station and the background seating, where the mosquitos would feed and transfer yellow fever and Zica virus to the local diners. Gone are the sixties, seventies and eighties icons that marked your table on cards, so even the most baked server could identify and serve you your vegan wrap and Sun Chips. Today's Melt is an investment in time and energy. The wait to get a table is anywhere from 25-45m, and getting your food is maybe another 20-30m. It's not that much different than kitchen at the old place, you just never had to wait along side the legion of suburbanites who have suddenly found Northside. There was a sixty year old guy with hiked up belted shorts and a matching shirt asking if this place was a \"chain\". The bar seems to draw a lot of them, which even though I don't drink- I found somewhat annoying. If I wanted to eat at a BW3 (like in Finneytown) I would shuffle over there where the parking is better. I go to Nside for the vibe, and the new Melt killed my Nside boner big time. I had the Cobb salad, and if I closed my eyes I could imagine myself at every Applebees from here to Secaucus. The ambient noise is really loud, and I wasn't able to hear my GF speak, even though she was less than three feet away. At the end, the waitress tried to up sell us into a chocolate lava whatever. At the old place, the waitress wandered off after she filled your ice tea and that was about it. In short, I miss the vibe and food from the old place, don't miss the mosquitos though."}, {"review_id": "HCIHsCtR4Jxk9QQVWekICA", "user_id": "MuaUwBcQ6TFYJMCHNBNCZw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/4/2017", "text": "I REALLY loved the old Melt.

I went with Verde Chicken which was roasted chicken breast, artichoke, zucchini, sun-dried tomato, pepita basil pesto, provolone, with a balsamic drizzle, baked on flatbread and the classic mac n cheese. It didn't take too long for the food to come out. I will admit there were several things I wanted to try. I also ordered the ginger ale after sampling that and the mango lemonade. The food was good. Sandwich had a lot of favor. The pesto and cheese brought the sandwich a tasty favor. The mac n cheese were with what appeared to be wheat pasta so I had to add a little something for my liking.
