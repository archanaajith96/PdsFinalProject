It was very nice. The server was very sweet and friendly. Gave us plenty of time to decide. I came with someone who isn't a big veggie person. I was surprised they were very accommodating, since I pointed out they had fried rice but comes with veggies. I asked if they could just make it plain without veggies. I would've expected them to say no because it's difficult to find places that are willing to separate. It was still very delicious! Plus their Thai milk tea is excellent."}, {"review_id": "BM6CB6_1709ujDADLRfItw", "user_id": "Y-Nw5aHh3T7IkUZA32WFBw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "I absolutely love getting Beef Pho soup from this restaurant especially on a super cold as usual Rochester night. I tend to go with my sorority sister and it is our spot.It isnt too noisy or overly decorated. The service is good, not too attentive but the waitstaff are all nice and friendly.They have a very extensive menu but what uou need to get is Pho. Period! It is so freaking tasty.Their thai coffee was alright nothing too special but sweet and tasty. I wouldnt bring too many people as the space is more for intimate parties."}, {"review_id": "RtmF3XUObA2Yu9yE5iVjwA", "user_id": "jqqB8hWF8kIrv2-qWt23xg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "We got here an hour before closing on a Saturday night, which may explain the lightning fast service, but I have a feeling this place prides itself on friendly, family-business-type service and it's well worth the pride.First off, how do you even get pho that cheap?! I haven't had pho for such an affordable price since the early 2000's - our whole meal came out to a little under $20 minus tip. And our food came out super fast - probably about 5-10 minutes after we put in the order.I got the chicken pho with the chicken broth - the chicken was a little dry but when soaked into the broth, it had flavor and texture. The broth was really delicious, a tad on the salty side but just bordering on savory. I squeezed a bit of the hoisin sauce into the broth and mixed it up and it was delicious. We had so much left over that we ended up taking our leftovers home."}, {"review_id": "lRqIqxnmarJpJDrvnHYwGg", "user_id": "euoQ3CQmJwyvTCG4lSUcLg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Yesterday I bought takeout PHO with beef brisket and shaved beef with extra veggies. The veggies were really fresh and great tasting, the meat was OK but the broth was not that great tasting. I ended up adding beef broth to it along with some soy sauce to help with the flavor. Next time I might try just a veggie PHO or possibly one with shrimp and not the beef. It was though very hot and a great takeout item. The hostess was also very friendly."}, {"review_id": "loCLTC8OjlqwL4hrqXlhPg", "user_id": "IwlN3gbUFrFtN3x_pp7JJQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Ive had SEA bookmarked for ages and couldn't wait to try it.... unfortunately, I was very let down. We placed an order for pick up and got there a few minutes before it was ready. Despite reading off the order to my boyfriend and packaging it while he was there, they gave him someone else's order. We were super bummed when we got home and discovered that the vermicelli bowl I was so looking forward to was MIA. We called them and they told us to come back and get the right food, but didn't offer much in the way of reparations. 20 minutes later we finally sat down to eat and the food was obviously much colder than it should have been. The peel and eat shrimp also left much to be desired so that, in combination with the (lack of) temperature, leads me to say that I can't see myself going back here. The highlight of the meal was the fried egg roll, but it wasn't enough to save the overall rating. Obviously most people have a better experience here so I hope our situation is the exception not the rule!"}, {"review_id": "OnjPxQvNGM5bw-Z_-ypZ3Q", "user_id": "oi96xWn_hDvfjpQF6HyGKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "New to the area and have shopping around for new restaurants.

With kids, it's a risk! The kids loved the egg rolls. For $3.75? We ordered 2 more plates. They loved the wonton soup and I've never seen wonton soup like this. There were at least 8 dumplings/wontons in each plus chicken. My Pho was great. Husband's Pho also great. Strawberry smoothie was perfect for a picky toddler. I will return and want to try more!

There's nothing more satisfying on a cool Rochester day than a delicious bowl of Pho and a hot cup of tea. Both SEA locations offer a clean, and pleasant atmosphere with beautiful Asian music in the air and a friendly staff. Their pho is out of this world with a most flavorful broth and the freshest ingredients. There are many varieties of Pho to choose from and a broad selection of other traditional Asian  dishes. I also love their fresh spring rolls served with peanut sauce. Yum! I need to try more things on the menu, but always end up going with Pho and spring rolls. Their prices are extremely reasonable too. Hope you give them a try if you haven't already.

So generally, this means that a majority of restaurants will basically refrigerate or freeze the broth. While this method is okay, it definitely does not produce really rich broth because what they'll do is they'll just ladle out the amount of frozen broth for your bowl and then do what's necessary. That isn't the case with SEA.SEA's broth is fresh and the flavor is strong. I'm sorry to say this for my own mom considering I'm a full-blooded Vietnamese, but SEA makes better pho than her. What SEA gives you is homemade in a matter of only fifteen minutes of waiting. I've also had their rice plates and it's authentic and filling. The broken rice, though generally a lower grade of rice than Jasmine is delicious when made right. The option for different types of meat or cut is also very different from most restaurants. This is the place I take my boyfriend to whenever he has this craving for Viet food, and it never disappoints. He himself admits it's one of the best pho places he's been to and he's quite the eater. Do yourself a flavor and enjoy an authentic bowl of pho right here in Rochester."}, {"review_id": "egReCRYeiBlkNJ0yQVgNOw", "user_id": "hJ9-TKjqMNbp4QCGVzhNvg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/7/2017", "text": "South East Asia is where it's at on a Friday night on Monroe Ave.  This place is always poppin' and it is because the food is delish.I ordered the hu tieu do bien, which is a pho with: shrimp, imitation crab, squid, and a \"fish cake\". The pho was pretty good, but because the place was slammed on a Friday, the service was sub par.  It took awhile for the food to come out, and to get the pho toppings (limes, basil, bean sprouts, soup ladle spoons). The noodles are always very filling, and I typically have to ask for a to-go container for the next day's lunch. I still am partial to Pho Viet's shrimp pho, but since they have turned over to a new establishment, I am on the hunt for the best Rochester pho bowl fo sho'.The shrimp spring rolls are so fresh, and come with four. They are a perfect little appetizer to hold you over until your pho or entrees come out. It comes with a tasty dipping sauce as well.I like that this place has that \"hole in the wall feel\", but sometimes it can be a wait. The problem is there isn't much space to wait, so there will be people opening and closing the door constantly, hovering near your table waiting for one to open up. I will definitely be back for a Pho Fix, but it might be during a lunch time, to avoid that weekend bustle."}, {"review_id": "vTkm2epKoOk6j4uPTAuTEg", "user_id": "XLEoM9kHsPeBfOx6BJYVhQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/3/2017", "text": "Recently revisited SEA a few times for pho, I'm almost afraid to admit but I find the pho \"okay\" here.

The fried squid is my go to app, I thought I remembered it being a bit crispier and tender but it is still tasty.

Everything about the food here was just right. My husband & I split the salad with shredded chicken to start. It was definitely large enough for two as a starter or could be a nice entree for one. The dressing had a nice balance of fish sauce and lime. We each had pho for our main dish--seafood for me and the eyeround steak for my husband. The broth was delicious; not too salty or overpowering. We got the regular sized bowl and it was very filling, but there is an extra large bowl option if you're really hungry. The prices here are really reasonable too.The only downside to this restaurant is the overall atmosphere. It is very small. We had to sit at a table near the door so every time someone came in we got a blast of wintery cold air. There are tables farther from the door but they were already taken. It isn't fancy, but the food is excellent and a really good deal.
