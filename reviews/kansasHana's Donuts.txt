I've tried their donuts at Oddly Correct and One More Cup and loved them, so I wanted to give this off the beaten path a try.We had an event on a Saturday morning so I called Hana's early in the week and the server was friendly and helpful to make sure we had tons of unique donuts for the whole group. I set a pickup time for 8 a.m. Saturday and they were completely boxed and ready for me then. I love when places are on the ball, score one for the little donut shop.Now where Hana's is on the map, I don't really know. My GPS was as tired as I was on this particular morning, sending me every which way. I think an easy way to find them is exit off of 635 but definitely don't trust me on this.OK enough nonsense, let's talk donuts. These donuts are insanely delicious. I snuck one as I headed to the event and went with a lightly glazed, blueberry cake. It was perfection. Not super dense like a waterlogged rock, but more so like a fluffy hybrid of cake/glazed. The flavors were light and perfect. Ordered coffee for the group but didn't try any this go round.The appearance of the donut case is enough to make you drool. Let's be real, sprinkles make every donut better and they have loads of sprinkled options. They also have some fancy pastries that look too nice to eat. Friendly folks, locally owned, amazing donuts, this is a total homerun."}, {"review_id": "0SfMlUy9XkyQcGWHakq_xw", "user_id": "DhILUyWXSgArbn8afRMafA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2017", "text": "Hana's donuts are a hidden gem in Kansas City. A no fuss shop that's here for one thing and one thing only: amazing donuts. My husband and I came in and we're drooling over the items in the display case. The shop is small but has two tables that could fit about eight; and has a cooler for drinks and some coffee.We had their red velvet old fashioned, chocolate old fashioned, lemon and raspberry jelly filled glazed, a Bavarian cream and a chocolate glaze. The jelly filled were bursting! They're filled TO order so the jelly is fresh and the cake doesn't have a chance to get soggy. We were warned they would blow up in our face upon first bite and it was true - beware: if you're not careful you could lose some of that delicious jelly. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a damn good donut."}, {"review_id": "RmbzGN5MFPkwgkx84k3RWQ", "user_id": "aVBZ6TW7o3Lx0BjplVYF6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/14/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "On a whim, I stopped to get some donuts to take to work. I got a dozen of the \"ring\" donuts ($10.99) and 2 dozen cinnamon bites ($2.29/doz) along with 2 apple fritters. The cinnamon bites are cute little baby cinnamon rolls. They were very soft and fluffy. I didn't get a chance to try any of the other \"ring\" donuts, but definitely didn't hear any complaints.The apple fritters, which typically are my favorite thing in life (after Crab Rangoon) were sad. They were very thin, tough and crunchy. I would have preferred a thicker, fluffier donut. It was like beef jerky, but with donuts.The lady that got my donuts ready was really friendly and so polite. I will be back and I won't hold a grudge about the apple fritter. Sometimes thing just aren't your taste, but it doesn't mean it wouldn't be something someone else would like."}, {"review_id": "bj39LwVWwtuJvY9UIfqgpQ", "user_id": "BEG_K6Yce-NqjtDjd-y9RQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "We ordered donuts for my daughters first birthday and they were so helpful and wonderful to work with.

During my first visit, I opted to try more of the sophisticated donuts and went with my first choice of sweet and salty: a maple glaze donut with roasted pecans on top and it didn't disappoint. Next, I tried their white chocolate glaze with coconut shavings... Another one that didn't disappoint. I should've resisted and kept it light, but these donuts were too good to stop at two, so I kept going.The next one I tried was the cinnamon glaze donut with roasted walnut shavings on it and was my stomach glad I tried another one, but my cholesterol might've disagreed.

The standard glaze is about on par with Lamars doughnuts but they are smaller and a little stingy on the glaze.Cake doughnuts are a little underwhelming, but better than Lamars. They are slightly dry, but the frosting is excellent. The different flavors are delicious and actually have a wide range of flavors.The filled doughnuts are pretty good. They have a good balance of filling and doughnut and it's not overwhelmingly sweet.The best doughnut I've tried is the old fashioned. It has a surprising flavor within the dough.

Lovely, light but not too light with a good fresh taste--not yeasty or flour-y.

This is no Krispy Kreme where it's delicious hot and not so great 10 minutes later. These are fresh donuts made on site and coated with glazes and frostings made there as well. Delicious hot, still good tomorrow. The friendly lady behind the counter completes the total experience.

I have found my donut place!I have been looking for a donut joint ever since moving to the area 1 1/2 years ago. I've had okay donuts, but I haven't been wowed. Hana's donuts wowed me.What has disappointed me about most donut joints is they don't know how to make a proper old fashioned donut--Hana's donuts makes some of the best I've ever had. Great, crisp texture (though lacking pedals, but that's a minor issue) on the outside and soft and sometimes gooey (where the glaze has soaked in) interior. Both the glazed and chocolate frosted--with its tasty, *very* chocolatey, ganache-like frosting-- were very satisfying.All of their cake-based donuts were great--good flavor and not dry at all. I especially liked the orange zest and red velvet.Another stand-out was the apple fritter.  At first, I was put off because it is very thin, but that helps the fritter keep it's crunchy exterior and apple-goodness without so much of the extraneous dough parts.I'm not a yeast donut fan, but I had a bite of the chocolate frosted one and it was good.  My husband said that it was breadier than most other yeast donuts but he liked it because it didn't seem so heavy and greasy that way.I think Hana's Donuts makes some of the best donuts in the KC area. Definitely give it a try--just remember that when you're looking for it the large storefront sign says Poston Donuts & Pastries (not sure if that's old or what, but I drove by it the first time not knowing the sign was old). Whatever its name is, it's sweet fried goodness."}, {"review_id": "NJF1J3d2KNThfJKI2e34Jg", "user_id": "MM-33wptEuku7dcjiyqtlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/2/2017", "text": "Wow.
