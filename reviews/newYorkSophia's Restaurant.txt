We were seated right away despite the fact that they were very busy. We got drinks right away, and all the ladies that served and greeted us were very friendly and welcoming! For breakfast we ordered the classics eggs bacon toast and fries, and the apple cinnamon pancakes. Both were fantastic, but I recommend trying those apple cinnamon pancakes! They also had a full bar with classic breakfast cocktails and some incredible looking bloody Mary's. Will make sure to try those next time we visit. Excellent food and amazing service! Highly recommend checking out Sophia's!"}, {"review_id": "XcnRNqTvaH-2nl3aeLqtsQ", "user_id": "MCFaMArvWdRn59Zzg4zkWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Tried & True! When my Airbnb guests are looking for a \"diner\" - I send them here. Simple, Traditional, American breakfast & lunch fair. Happy to sit at the bar by my lonesome at this joint. I always end up sitting next to the best people. Always friendly, sweet & enjoying their breakfast food! My favorite menu items include, but are not limited to: Apple Cinnamon French Toast, Soft Scrambled Eggs with Cheese, Bacon, Home-Fries, Rye Toast. Love the endless coffee & sometimes i even treat myself to a mimosa. The staff knows their regulars & are always sure to say \"Hello!\" in that extra special way that you all know what I'm talking about. Even as I type this, I'm realizing that I haven't been here in a while & I miss it."}, {"review_id": "tLubX-8NNwJiYPLFXoXQjQ", "user_id": "WDNo8ijTRREGGftekLWBBQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "I've been to Sophia's a couple of times for breakfast and I've found the food to be simple, well-made, and reasonably priced. There are many places in the Buffalo area I would prefer to go for breakfast, but when I asked for my bacon extra crispy and eggs over medium, that's exactly what I got at Sophia's. That's not always the case for your typical greasy spoon diner! You get the basics here - nothing fancy or imaginative. The servers are friendly, if a little rushed, but on our last visit we hit right between the early and late breakfast rushes and it was more of a laid-back experience. It can get pretty chilly in the small space on cold days when people keep going in and out. When we were there a couple of weeks ago, pretty much everyone seated within three tables of the door kept their coats on. That's not something the staff can do much about, but just to be aware if you're planning to go on a cold day."}, {"review_id": "NP3gkhnEu0KKGeZC_YhjfA", "user_id": "-B69h4ujXXNcPbIenONazg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "This is probably the best brunch restaurant in Buffalo. I've been there 2 times and every time we had to wait over 30 minutes but believe it or not totally worth it :)Their food is amazing and huge like for sure you would have left over.Their egg Benedict's is simply one of their best breakfast. I ordered their apple cinnamon pancakes as everyone wrote review about it, it was good but not that wow to say for sure I have to get it. Their coffee was something! I love coffee and the coffee I had there wow was one of the best coffees I've ever had. The restaurant is not that big for more than group of 5-6 . Every one there are so kind and friendly . You feel it is family and local business , so if you are one of those people that want to try local brunch this is one of the best one. The music was not that good but it is so crowded that the noise of happy people make a good music :) their decoration is so cool and I just simply can't wait to get back there :)"}, {"review_id": "ySST-q3xqVCif1BHCgXeNA", "user_id": "5eQVN1PF4d2PWtSJenwfCw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "Today I had the cinnamon banana French toast, egg over medium and home fries with the works.

I've never had a bad meal here and the service has always been spot-on. I've tried lots of dishes, but my favorite is to split a sweet and savory dish with a dining companion.

Everyone clearly on their A game and looking to move you in and move you out, but not in a rushed fashion so to speak. I came here based solely on the Yelp reviews and once again it didn't disappoint. My waitresses name escapes me, but she was fantastic, as was the hostess who seemed to be a hands on type f hostess. Pay attention kids, just because you're a hostess doesn't mean you don't have to get your hands dirty once in while. There is an attached heated waiting room, 3 seasonal type of porch. I mean it's Buffalo, it gets cold, and snows.... A lot  thankfully it didn't the Saturday we were there, but about 2 feet feel the following Saturday. Apparently god loves Tom Brady and the Patriots. This sat am I even gave my waitress a gift, it was a ring of sorts, I was feeling festive. She was genuinely happy about it, and that sums up my feelings about this place. Actually it wasn't a real ring, it was a reminder, because she forgot my friends coffee. It worked, she didn't forget another thing...

Often omelettes have a super thing egg sheath filled with stuff, but these eggs were actually filled entirely throughout with tons of goodness and cheese (which I loved.) The homefries tasted fresh and excellent, and o.m.g. I don't know how the bread and butter was so amazing but it was. I could seriously eat a whole loaf of that bread and butter - it was *that* good.

There are very few places that get a 5, and even fewer that I can say deserve higher than a 5. The staff is awesome and the food is amazing. I cant really say much else, other than if youre looking for a place to get breakfast give this place a try. While obviously wait times will vary depending on when you go (we waited 45min for a table for 6), its well worth the wait and you can get drinks from the bar while you wait.

It was early morn and wanted breakfast. Chose Sophia's bc of the reviews and so glad we did.  this place was great! Very casual, and no frills, but the food and service (most importantly the food!) was excellent. The space is kind of small and busy so we had about a 25 min wait. People waiting sit outside in an enclosed porch area that looks like it was added on. From the reviews I've read, waiting is inevitable. Everything on the menu sounded so good it was hard to decide what to get. Hubs got eggs, home fries, the special ham off the bone and their homemade toast. I got the special Italian sausage, broccoli and cheddar omelet with home fries and homemade toast and one piece of French toast. We couldn't believe the amount of ham that came in an order. 2 big slices! The eggs were cooked perfectly to order and the home fries were delicious slices of soft on the inside and super crispy on the outside potatoes. Prob the best I've had. They would have been perfect had they had a little onion too. The omelet was really good and had no shortage of the add ins. If you go, be sure to specify you want toast made with their homemade bread. Oh, and the French toast was great too. Simple and eggy just like I like. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the coffee wasn't as hot as I like it, but my husband thought it was fine. I def recommend this place. There is a bar and people were ordering bloody Mary's and other breakfast cocktails that I will def try next time too. My husband said this is now his go to place in Buffalo."}, {"review_id": "1MzQFErilmPwTgVkPNHPzQ", "user_id": "vu3bhCvRgHH1xzr4ufElWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Amazing eggs benedict... believe the hype.  This is one of the best breakfast spots in WNY.  Get there early to get on the list!"}, {"review_id": "sZJTxZCn6ZwslqZ0RsWCbg", "user_id": "NhTWPDnDy0UomxeFpqcNBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/2/2017", "text": "Road Trip from Chicago to Ny.

Especially considering that it was almost an hour wait in the freezing cold outside to get in there although fortunately they do have a patio with some space heaters on there so that worked out for part of the time. I had to Sophia to omelette which is basically agree, with feta cheese, Mara olives and onions and some tomato. I would say on a scale of 1 to 10 it was probably a 7 1/2 to an eight. I might get it again but the arm that was a bit overcooked. The toast was good, they had a good selection of ice teas, we also had the hashbrowns and eggs. The eggs were cooked perfectly over easy hash Brown was good but nothing outrageously good.So I would say that if you can get into this restaurant with only a few minutes wait then it's probably going to be a good experience for you. The prices were reasonable so no complaints there the service was very good so I was happy with that. I might go again I just don't know that I would do breakfast. Also there was a really good selection of choices on the menu and it's probably not fair to take any points off after you've just tried one item seeing as the service and other things were good so it's worth a shot."}, {"review_id": "3UaWb2g2354LnWEm3YdupQ", "user_id": "DeVhs2qisV1_poL7qSRz_Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "I had high hopes for Sophia's, because every time I drive by the place it's packed. We went for breakfast on a Saturday. The food was normal breakfast fare--nothing to write home about. I will say that the Bloody Mary's were great. The restaurant itself was quite dirty and I'm not sure if this is a normal thing, but there were there small black flies buzzing around us while we ate. Not sure that I'll go back. I can definitely get a better breakfast at a number of other restaurants."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sophias-restaurant-buffalo?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
