The food was absolutely amazing, the best Thai food I've had. The portions were perfect, and the service was attentive and very personable. We ate in the restaurant, it's BYOB and very small which I liked about it. I will suggest that if you eat there in the winter to dress warm! Now on to the food, we had Nime Chow, Thai rice noodle soup, pineapple fried rice with shrimp, and chicken pad Thai. Everything was perfect, and the leftovers were just as good the next day! That's how you know it's good. The Thai rice noodle soup is plenty for two people to share as a great appetizer.I've been on a search for a good Thai food restaurant in the area, and this is definitely the winner!"}, {"review_id": "fdThqbg_NGObVVKC5SvDHg", "user_id": "8MdLRHSKok2RzD2PkeXCOQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I like the hospitality here more than the food,the lady is very sweet. I tried the duck meat for the first time and I did enjoy it. But the maggi kinda noodles were comparitively better I thought.

SOOO DELICIOUS! So much flavor & very colorful to look at. I have yet to try anything else that is on the menu. The service was prompt & kind. Reasonable pricing. After checkout, the woman, whose name I am not sure of, gave me a blue & gold stitched Thailand coin purse, so cute.

I don't normally write reviews unless I feel strongly about a place. The waitress/cook/owner is so gracious and sweet and kind. She reminds me of my mother who lives to feed you. Oh and the food is quite good. I'm south Asian and like my food, and their dishes are tasty and spot on. This is a hole in the wall, so don't expect anything fancy or elaborate decor.

The owner, I assumed, was very welcoming and offered great service. We started with fried pork dumplings and curry puffs. Both were delicious and served fairly quick and piping hot. I had the Mama's noodles with chicken. It was one of the best noodledishes I've ever had. So full of flavor and fresh ingredients! We actually ordered two more orders to take home. Try their chili hot sauce, we put it on everything.

How fortunate I feel to have found this little gem in Cranston where the food is fresh and the service is warm. Just a few tables so take out is ideal but if you nab a seat it's a decent atmosphere.

After moving from Brooklyn, I was disappointed when I couldn't find a Thai place in the area that I liked. This is my new go to Thai restaurant! I ordered takeout, which was ready in a quick 10 minutes. The owner was so incredibly sweet on the phone and in person when I picked up my food. I ordered curry puffs and chicken pad Thai, and they were both excellent. A lot of other places in the area serve pretty bland pad Thai, but this one was fantastic. I will definitely be ordering from here again."}, {"review_id": "6FXfbst_f5qXi08Gr94SSg", "user_id": "emCcsyY0XaKlAiCeppB0EQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "This place has to be the best home made style thai food I've ever had.

The adorable Thai lady who takes your order is just a gem. That being said the food is good, but it's not amazing. We liked that it wasn't overly salty or sweet, but also felt like the food was on a milder side in terms of flavor. Ordered the tom yum and green curry which were nice, just a little underwhelming. Lots of veggies in the green curry, which I liked a lot. Their spicy fried rice was delicious and their pad Thai was also a solid average, not the best I've had. In all - a good place to go with decent prices and excellent service. Just don't expect your mind to be blown."}, {"review_id": "xswSuWc0JwxvrmzgxYabsg", "user_id": "l00GdNZt6zNO0yp1VjKFJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2017", "text": "Context: Ordered takeout for dinner for my wife and I. We eat Thai food often and love it.Pros: Very affordable. This should place should be $, not $$, as many of their entrees are under $10. The steamed shrimp shu mai and pad see ew with shrimp were both very good for the price (and the latter was even better when I added some sauce from the shu mai).Cons: My wife's vegetable soup was extremely bland. The seating area is tiny, so probably best to stick with takeout.Bottom line: Recommended if you're in the area and you want good, cheap takeout"}, {"review_id": "dMsiI0C-KeidxqpLP0eLxg", "user_id": "ffif0jA1fAEtA0ISbgD6VQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2017", "text": "I'd give this place more stars if I could. The prices are reasonable, the food is delicious. I love the little coconut crackers that get tossed in with take out. And the abundance of fortune cookies. Drunken Noodles are a go to for most of my office, but I have also tried the yellow curry and was in love with that. Also, the woman who works there is the SWEETEST! She does tell you she loves you. And when I called one time because I couldn't find my rice after all our take out got back to the office, she explained how she had packed all our items up, knew that my rice was in a separate bag. And when I told her it was probably downstairs in our kitchen and hung up to go find it - she called back to make sure it was there. She is the best!Good food and good customer service. Also, the price range options on yelp - $$ = $11-$30?? That's a big range. This is more like $11 for something like the drunken noodles. Most I have spent is maaaaaybe $17 and that's when I add an app or something."}, {"review_id": "FgUdDbcBym-mtf6R7aJS1g", "user_id": "DbhaUxlgtn8cwFMnyjASiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/4/2016", "text": "This place has excellent food. Everything was so fresh and the service was amazing. We decided to dine in. The seating area only holds a few people, so if you have a large group you will be out of luck. The older woman who works there is so nice and she is very attentive. Great service all around and the food was prepared very quickly. We started off with the Thai chicken rolls. Amazing. Sometimes you go to restaurants and they have some frozen rolls they heat up for you. They are pretty generic and all taste the same. Thai Orchid had amazingly fresh rolls and you could taste that the filling was homemade. For our dinner I had the country paid thai and my husband had the chicken and shrimp dinner. What I enjoyed about the pad thai was the great flavor without the heaping amount of peanut sauce that some places throw on your dish. We will definitely come back here in the future."}, {"review_id": "R835iBxOLJdG6_3INazS-w", "user_id": "PA6pA6_RlMsl6fF7UBUlBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "Superb little nook of greatness!

Most Thai place here are overrated, so it nice to try something that was different. Providence is my college hometown, so I know all about the in's and out's of food there, but am always looking to for an adventure and happy my best friend brought me to one of his favorite restaurants out there. Upon arrival, I thought the place was small but wasn't going to hold them to that. Overseas some of the best food comes from a hole in the wall or even in someone's basement. What did it for me was the customer service. The family was very nice and friendly which I can appreciate being from New York once again. For appetizers, we ordered Chicken Wings and Crab Rangoon and for the main meal with had Pad Thai and Masaman Curry. Every came and great time and was delicious. The appetizers were normal the same as what you would get at a Chinese food restaurant in Rhode Island. However the main course was delicious, yes the curry was a sweet but not sweeter than any other Thai restaurant so that's fine in my book. The portions are based on the old America. To be honest, I left satisfied, I never want to leave a place feeling too full where I can't walk out of the place. The food held me down until dinner which was just what I was looking for. The family checked on us often and gave us KitKat's and fortune cookies with our checks. I love it. Question - Will I be back? Answer - You bet I will be. Next time, I order something different and let you know how it goes.
