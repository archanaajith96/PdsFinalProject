Good thing it's RIGHT ACROSS OUR HOUSE!!"}, {"review_id": "bOq5YK81JBq7MQru00FQTw", "user_id": "FV_ry_NBYCEwOSME_owqvA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "I don't normally order sushi for take out but I had a rush day. I ordered the Deep Ocean Roll and the Avocado Roll through the Beyond Menu app. When I arrived, the gentleman was very nice. I only wanted about 5 mins before I got my food. I probably live 10 mins away.The Avocado Roll was good. The Deep Ocean Roll was delicious! It had all types of fish on it and lightly fried. It also had some sauces on top so I wouldn't need to put soy sauce on it. It was so good, I had to share with my mom. She said she'd like to have more of it. I'm going back again to try other special rolls and order that same roll for my parents."}, {"review_id": "Z7aoqWCqL9Jr2KCCB3mUWA", "user_id": "ZPC7F7u250Nij6WGxeQpjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Boyfriend and I ate here lastnight for the first time and was extremely pleased.

The staff sat my family down and they totally forgot about us. No beverage, just a lot of blank stares like we didn't exist. We got passed by the whole staff but nobody bothered to take our orders or ask if we've been helped. We left without tasting the food. If I could give this restaurant a -10 I would have, too bad it only goes to 1 star. I would not go back to this place ever again even though the rest of the reviews says that this place is top notch."}, {"review_id": "T66s3gwWu152tXxWpCA6WQ", "user_id": "JOuBOXJDs6bJkanshSc5rA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/3/2017", "text": "First time eating at this restaurant and it was not a disappointment!

Service never ever disappoints us. We were there late and kinda interrupted their dinner time. But they still made us the best sushi boat. Nothing was rushed. Top notch sushi chef they have!

The Phad Thai  and the drunken noodles were bland, and the California roll was mostly avocado. I ordered online so maybe we missed something in the ordering process. I'm going to give it a try one more time by ordering at the location instead of online and then I'll come back and post again."}, {"review_id": "aF_r4Jw7MKCXgINJdL7kMg", "user_id": "BQpnWrF1qpF_GOABKAMs5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/7/2016", "text": "My new favorite sushi place! My husband and I were starving, so we ordered the sashimi & sushi for two in the hopes that it would be enough and boy.... it was enough. Probably one of the best sushi boats I've had in a long time. What's most impressive is the portion of fish to rice ratio... very generous! The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because we have not been impressed by their Thai food so far... but maybe we'll come back, give them a second chance."}, {"review_id": "G86H4GtDTUxYBwJL_4hW_g", "user_id": "7GRZeJ4DCqEifnc2CMhmzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I have lived this place for years.

Inside, wow. Impressive. Beautifully decorated with a modern look. Ambiance was quiet and possibly romantic (depending on your mood). Clean, sleek, and dimly lit. I ordered sashimi for lunch. The menu said nine pieces but I counted 11 pieces. Boom! The rice portion was small but for me, the better. (Yes, I just said that.) Each piece was cold and fresh. I certainly enjoyed my lunch.Cool tip. Use the restroom. It's like walking into a nightclub with the red/blue lights!"}, {"review_id": "eicztsufvZwb8usO2GDLig", "user_id": "Mc45ichKzwRsFzIb51n85g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/24/2016", "text": "I really enjoy this place the lunch specials are awesome 8-10 bucks.  No all you can eat but the quality of seafood at this place is much better!

The outside can be a little deterring if you have never been here before but don't judge this book by its cover. The inside is decorated really nicely,  the sushi bar is super clean,  and the staff are dressed in proper uniforms. I typically get a rainbow roll but my fiance is wild with her choices.  All of which tasted very fresh.  I've been to a few other sushi places around this area and while okay, they just weren't up to the quality of Mikado.  Other places have brought loose rolls which fell apart,  Mikado knows how to keep it tight ;)I really hope the lease owner improves this shopping area cause it honestly looks like we are in Green Run or something SO GROSS."}, {"review_id": "e6apeI59lFtrvMDnBeJuTw", "user_id": "jOl1N5D67HinOpComVUbDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "The service has consistently been great every time I've been here.  I've had pad Thai as well as sushi, I've never been disappointed.
