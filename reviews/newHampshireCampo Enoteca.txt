Just dont, or they need to seriously step up on that one. There is some real value on the app menu and some entrees [they do offer full and half portions on most pasta dishes]Bartenders great, drinks were spot on. I believe all the pasta is house made and what we got was great. Place is loud and busy on the weekends so be warned Shout out to Pete and Co. for doing a nice job."}, {"review_id": "L6hzdcT_LVJOB_WnCHZuKA", "user_id": "Kziw1-A9mbtbioNduwVWcA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Amazingly fresh food, awesome service, beautiful presentations, homemade desserts that are out of this world!!

Its a fresh farm to table Mediterranean/Italian cuisine. I've been there three times and each time the service has been outstanding and we were seated very quickly.My absolute favorite dish there is the squash ravioli... I think it's the tastiest ravioli I've ever had.  Moreover the prices are very reasonable, which makes it an attractive choice. They do have happy hour (4-6 I think), but only if you're sitting at the bar can you take part of this, it would be nice to receive the same benefit at a table."}, {"review_id": "_2Wpe5mxqb-KD5cIx4m05Q", "user_id": "jIPdZm0uVcBLKdp3pEwdww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "Best farm-to-table Italian place in the area. Fresh pasta, excellent specials, great service. My husband and I have  been here a number of times and have never been disappointed.Their carbonara, rigatoni, and four cheese pastas are our go-to comfort food. They are just so good. They have a potato pizza that's simple but oh-so good. Their daily specials (that we've tried) were also great. You get so much value for money for the quality of food. I just wish they were kid-friendly, and we'd be dining here almost every week. But still, Campo Enoteca is so far, our favorite restaurant in the area. Awesome place that anyone who loves pasta should try."}, {"review_id": "4_hIZAFQREGsUTBrUw5-Vw", "user_id": "5lY4wi2LQqPYamXKV5W-pw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "Wow, blown away! Cutting thru Manchvegas on our way home, great lunch option. Steven, our server was very knowledgeable and just the right amount of friendly! Thank you :) Recently gave up meat and dairy, and there were lots of vegan and vegetarian options for us. Butternut squash ravioli for me (not vegan, but vegetarian), and my boyfriend had a vegan mushroom pasta with cauliflower cream sauce. Both were so delicious, I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area."}, {"review_id": "EQAf0K-I0q8rSscxKffu1A", "user_id": "6Z3TWN8fR3tECB7I8_zPjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "This was our second time eating at campo and everything was excellent!

Overall, great spot and one of my top recommendations for people in Manchester. Farm-to-table food, great pastas and pizzas, and a solid number of vegetarian options. The pasta dishes are especially excellent - we'd particularly recommend the pesto pasta, the butternut squash ravioli, and the spaghetti and meatballs. Really like how you can order a half or a full size! They also sometimes have a special cake for dessert, so look out for that (and get the red velvet cake if it's available).This place can get busy on Friday/Saturday nights, but we never had to wait if we stopped in on a weekday. Good service, too -- once we arrived right as the kitchen was closing, but they kept it open a little longer so that they could take us."}, {"review_id": "XXUo5gweu20AX0KdXiXgdA", "user_id": "CJe8O61CM4TFMcw3lDR_pQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "I often find myself unable to choose between Campo and Republic so I just try to cycle between the two.

Homemade pasta and delicious sauces. The Polpetti aka meatball appetizer is a must have! Definitely in the top 3 best I've ever had! Don't miss the Charcuterie board. If you're sitting near the side of the bar, you'll be able to watch them slice everything to order. My favorite entrees are the Sicilan eggplant, orecchiette, and the braised beef. The pressed chicken looks amazing as well. I'll be trying that at my next visit. The lemon ricotta pie hits the spot for desert. Dianne is a phenomenal server.
