These guys have definitely set the bar up HIGH for a Brazilian Steakhouse!! Love this place!! Have eaten here a handful of times since this establishment opened. THE PLACE: Located off of Southside in the Tinseltown area, it replaced a forever closed Kan-Ki, which I think is interesting to see how they transformed the establishment into what it is now since there was just hibachi everywhere. I wouldn't say the place \"looks\" super fancy either, which is nice because I like to go in comfortable clothing to enjoy me som AYCE food! But, if you're taking your hunny here, don't be afraid to dress up. Either way, I don't believe you will feel out of place.THE FOOD: LOVE IT. Love their Salad Bar. I typically get:- Heart of Palm- Tabouli- Large Asparagus- Some type of saladAlso in the Salad Bar area they have some hot side dishes, which I typically get- Rice- Mushrooms- BeansAll good. Very very good. If I was vegetarian, I would not mind just eating at the Salad Bar as they provide a plethora of items to choose from. I will say that I like Fogo de Chao's Market Table area better as there seems to be more selection and the presentation of the items looks superb. Meat selection - ALL GREAT. I've tried most of everything they have - from Top Sirloin to their Chicken, I have no complaints about any of it. I don't eat any of the bacon wrapped items, so I cannot evaluate those items. My personal favorites are the Beef Spare Ribs and the House Special (Picanha). One thing I can't forget to mention - I LOVE THEIR BREAD. IT IS FANTASTIC!THE SERVICE: 5 FREAKING STARS. Wish I can give more stars, seriously. Since we've been there a handful of times, they now recognize our faces. They pull my seat for me to sit down. I swear I have a fresh plate after I eat like 2-3 pieces of meat. The service for the meat is quick and of course you can control the rapidness with the red/green marker they provide to each person at the table. They are always asking for any meat requests and once we put in the request, it is immediately brought out. Drinks are always refilled, never have to ask. Side dishes for the table (such as the plantains, bread, etc) are refilled once it is empty. I'm not sure what else you would want. Literally taken care of from start to finish.THE DESSERT: I've tried the Papaya Cream and the Creme Brulee. Papaya Cream is hands down my favorite. I have no idea why, it's just a cool idea. If I have room, this is my go-to item. TL;DR: 5 Stars. Go here. Now. Great Salad Bar. Great food and meat selections. Great dessert. More-than amazing service. No Brazilian Steakhouse in town beats it."}, {"review_id": "w9loi0BStxMt3PGXPjeiHA", "user_id": "yPtECB9QFDGDSXTIkyZJ-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My SO and I came here for lunch last Friday. And all I can tell you is, we will be coming back. We had the full experience. We came in at lunch time so the prices was much cheaper, about 10 or 15 dollars cheaper than dinner time. Overall, the experience was fantastic. We were noticed. When we got up or sat down, there was someone there to help us. For the price you pay whether it be at 30 or 50 dollars, it is perfect. Everyone is extremely polite and the food was delicious.------------Had a nice Easter Sunday lunch here. My SO was saying no to a lot of the meats that were being served because he was on a no red meat diet. The servers noticed and asked what he'd prefer , he said chicken and so the second he said that, the server called everyone that was serving chicken to stop by our table ASAP. Another great time here at Terra Gaucha. Definitely coming back here real soon."}, {"review_id": "X7omd1xm_AMLKS7bsu0Xjw", "user_id": "P88wwKBLO6j-qwHcJrCUwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "This place seasons the meat well.  I had the full experience.  A glass of the red blend wine, which was a light body.  Full flavor is a better choice for red meat.  It was free so I told the waitress to pick one.  She was obviously a little flustered by the idea, but I told her go for it.  The ambience was the killer for me, I am a lover of natural light.  Also the buffet table area is to small and the lighting around should be brighter.  The plantains that we're on the table aesthetically hurt my eyes.They were not sweet or a little crispy around the rims.  The wait staff was ok.  Now this review is a comparison to another Brazilian Steakhouse Fogo De Chao at the Town Center.  I ate there on Saturday before Easter.  So long story short.  If you want well seasoned steak and chicken I would go to this place.  Prices are comparable to other Brazilian steakhouses in Jax.I would've given it five stars if I enjoyed the ambience."}, {"review_id": "fpaRZ-e2DovVvY-myJUBzg", "user_id": "EYZV9fZuV-4DoBX65Ve6yQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "I've been her multiple times and I can't believe I've never written a review on this place.Are you looking for an affordable place to experience the meat sweats? Well here it is! I brought my man here on a Friday night since he'd never experienced a Brazilian Steakhouse before and lucky for us we got there just in time, right before the dinner rush. The level of service is beyond amazing, from your main server and host/hostess laying napkins across your lap to pulling out your chair. I felt like a queen. The manager could also be seen floating around asking if everything was ok, if we needed something, or if we wanted any particular meat to come back around. Ah yes, the meat.Before the carnage we ordered a Caipirinha and a Blueberry Acai Mojito, two super-strong drinks perfect to work up the courage to eat all this food. We went light on the bar where they had soups, salads, fruits and veggies, pasta, even charcuterie and cheese. Then with a flip of the table cards from red to green, it started. Oh man, bacon-wrapped filet and chicken, sausage, ribs, top and bottom sirloin, filet mignon, ribeye, chicken drumsticks, lamb chops and leg of lamb...I was a lot and we took several breaks in between. My favorites were probably the bottom sirloin which was so tender and juicy and the bacon-wrapped chicken also juicy and the bacon gave it extra added flavor.He decided on dessert and went with the Creme de Papaya which I'd had before and agreed that it would go down easier without a struggle. It had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness to end the dinner.I feel the pricing is fair for what you get and we really enjoyed the evening. We will be back."}, {"review_id": "p9VKltLTlRAGWV3ekw-iSA", "user_id": "RLvTBpTpxz99RIbPHTBFPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "I don't even know how to come up with the words to describe this awesomely amazing restaurant! All I can say is Mouthwatering Deliciousness!Even on one of the busiest holidays of the Year (Valentines Day) the service was impeccable. The best part there's meat everywhere!!!!The do have a buffet style setting for your sides. Whether you like Jumbo Asparagus, Lobster Bisque, Mashed Potatoes, Salad Wedge, cheese bar, bacon, shrimp pasta salad, or chicken salad they have more than enough options to choose from. In order to get the meat servers to come around they have a card on the table where one side is red (stop) and the other is green (go). After the green side is turned up you're greeted with all different styles and cuts of meat and I'm here to tell you, it's best to try everything. They are a little on the pricey side but you're definitely getting your moneys worth. I can say this was a great experience and I'm overly excited to go back!!!"}, {"review_id": "2R2rzD3SZwFHssG2bkGqPg", "user_id": "Br7NfAxcRprDceabsyxZNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The location, service, and food is on point.

But share if you can...you'll have done enough damage by that point.Their weekend lunch special gives you the full experience at a more affordable price...again, the dinners aren't cheap, but you certainly can't say you didn't get enough food for your buck.This is definitely something you need to experience if you've never done it before.  Terra Gaucha is one in a Brazilian!  Get it?  Brazilian?  Yeah...somebody hug me please..."}, {"review_id": "JhHPdurkq7FKtCfDxa24hw", "user_id": "uV4N_ub9DclRwhNNo3_1nA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "This place is awesome, and it's heaven for meat/steak lovers. You will also get treated and pampered like a king/queen by all of the staff and manager. It is definitely worth it for just the dining experience alone if you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before. Just make sure you don't eat a lot during the day of your visit, so you can have enough space in your stomach for the unlimited amount of meat Terra Gaucha has to offer.Pace yourself while dining here, and don't overdo the salad bar in the beginning. Flip the card to red and take a break if you need to. We got overran with meat after leaving the card on green for a minute. If you want a particular type of meat that you don't see on the floor, just wave down a server or manager and they'd be happy to bring you whatever you want. Our favorite was their ribeye, medium rare.For dessert, we had the creme brûlée ($7.50), and the server set it on fire with rum ($9.50) at our table to caramelize the top layer. It was quite a spectacle! But do note that the dessert is not included in the price of your meat fest. We both agreed the creme brûlée was one of the best we've had in Jacksonville. Worth it!This is a great place to take your meat loving significant other for a special occasion."}, {"review_id": "sSLgZftLPK9XNGPtPXST_A", "user_id": "aV_EnZzYu_5bZyu4IlOYuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "My husband and I's favorite.

The service is always too notch, everyone comes around to check on you. No matter what cut of meat you like, they will make it to your liking! I usually like medium well to well done and in really thin portions, whether or not they have it at that moment, they'll always run to the back to cook up that cut of meat a bit more just to bring it back to me! So sweet! I love their hot bar too, although don't get too full from the carbs, even if you're a carbivore like me! The meat is the real reason you came here! Although the mashed potatoes and the mushrooms are on point. So is the lobster bisque (but I've never really gotten chunks of lobster in there, still has a good flavor) This place is not somewhere you can go every weekend unless you want a sodium overload, so be prepared to indulge!! The only downfall for me were the desserts. I didn't care too much for the flan or the tres leches cake- I like the flan a little less thick, and the tres leches a bit less sweet.

That's only because it is new I'm guessing.So made my reservation through Open Table. Got to my reservation a little over a half hour early. They were nice enough to take me in and seat me. Right from the start, the attention given by the staff is worthy of a 5 star, but wait there is more to it than the service. Continue reading.The impressive arrangement of select meats cooked in a rotisserie style oven and served cut table side.   Everything was tender, tasty, and moist. They bring you loads of meats until you flip the card that shows red which basically lets the meat servers know to stop. Aside from the meats, they also have what they call a Market Place where they have your starches and vegetables as well as salads available. They spread was inviting and like the meats were tasty. I was offered dessert, but because I was so full I passed until my next visit.This place is a Must Go when looking for a buffet style meal."}, {"review_id": "n7CwUD21KrZjIzmA-EMVig", "user_id": "GV7jfqiFQ53ZNKtE3v83_Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "I heard from a friend this place was really good sooo I decided one of these days I would get around to going and finally I DID!!!The atmosphere is very nice, classy and clean.

After a light salad the meat onslaught began, and the standout for me would be either the lamb or filet mignon. For the price that you pay, you would think there was something they would skimp on, whether quality of meat or service, however that is far from the case, with our waiters being incredibly helpful and patient.Towards the end, our group somehow managed to find space for dessert, I got an espresso and creme brûlée which was fantastic.All in all I would definitely be back and I am looking forward to it!"}, {"review_id": "H_jrKpTSVE-DDnBPCQmSjQ", "user_id": "spm6EeA9vbuBHdyRYr3zrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Had really good time here !!!
