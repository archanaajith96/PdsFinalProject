The service is pretty middle of the road, Bar is the best but server at a table wise they're knowledgeable but not like, excited about my experience? Food is better than most when it comes to the Midwest, but with any other competition it would be forgotten. They source good farm fresh food which I enjoy seeing. I enjoy more they don't make a song & dance about it every step of the way.Lunch wise, the 'hot' chicken for lunch isn't even as spicy as a Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich though. They're probably afraid to upset anyone who would find it to spicy, what happened to owners having some guts to do something edgy? The burger is good but like the Cuban, they would be better on better bread. It felt too tough. Their gnocchi is to die for, I would post a picture but it's not the most picturesque plate. Their cheese offerings are also great. Brunch is by far the worst of their offerings. The menu seldom changes and most of the dishes have been there for a long time. lacks anything that really grabs my attention. After traveling to other cities I realize how lacking their brunch offerings are. Their biscuits and gravy would make my grandma roll in her grave. Their horrible. I mean 4am Street diners have better biscuits & gravy. Even something like avocado toast (Yes yes) would be a welcoming sight. I can only eat so much eggs benny. All in all it seems like a place designed for the suburban family to feel 'cool' and 'hip' going downtown, but lacks anything really worth remembering. The food is well prepared but, pretty tame (I mean this in flavor - not saying I need octopus butter served on cow skin) designed to impress the average Midwest pallet who primarily dines at a chain.I frequent this spot and will, until something better comes along or their brunch improves then save me a seat!"}, {"review_id": "l1GbUuxVW-0SHTw7IDCq5g", "user_id": "iEK1xZ3cACgipw9xZuXa2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "This place is one of the best in Fort Wayne.

Since that delightful experience, I've been back 10 times ( 7 checkins) and am not about to stop.I have never had a bad dish here, and the bartender Tim is friendly and helpful when trying to make a meal decision. As you will see by the many pictures I've taken, the rotating seasonal menu will deliver rarities like sweetbreads all the way to steak and potatoes.During my last trip, I thought I'd see just how good the chefs are by ordering things I wouldn't normally get: lentils. I figured if they could make lentils taste good, they were truly worthy of a five star Yelp rating. As I expected, the lentils did not disappoint! Every bite was satisfying and flavorful. That's saying a LOT coming from a guy who grew out of a childhood legume allergy. I never liked the taste of 'em and found the allergic reaction an easy reason never to eat beans or peas again. If the chef was to put out a cookbook or offer classes, I'd be first in line.If you only have time for one meal in Fort Wayne, I recommend you stop by Junk Ditch. Imaginative food at a good price with great beer."}, {"review_id": "sen6j7HoYDxDVC14_yoWlA", "user_id": "QaXG7rpnNSoYefogI3SZWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "The space is beautiful. Not v private but somehow you don't hear everyone's conversations. We ordered a couple beers, a house wine, a salad and pizza. All food tasted and felt good. The outstanding part came when the chef, at the request of our server, came out to explain the different greens that were in our salad. We were wondering about a particular piece, and he was really great, and described every piece that was in our salad, including the piece we were wondering about. Which was delicious, by the way!The first time we tried to go here, we weren't even sure we had the right place. The parking lot was totally empty! We called them, and the person who answered the phone assured us that they were open, but at that point we just wanted to go someplace that we knew was actually open. Based on the reviews and their practice of using local vendors, we will surely be back again!"}, {"review_id": "NHXKo1oKLoAwyAlum-68Ig", "user_id": "EDdakGkrmyD8FgOeaFuDEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Very vintage and rustic style interior, very cool considering the location. Prompt service and surprisingly affordable beer. Beer selection was a bit limited I thought but enjoyed what I had nonetheless. The food selection was good but didn't impress as much as I had hoped. Ribeye was not cooked evenly, med-rare on one side and medium on the other, so for the price I thought the steak should have been flawless. My wife's Pork Ramen dish was creative and she seemed to enjoy it.

Came for brunch and our party was seated right away. They do take rsvp and asked us first if we had one so maybe rsvp is common or recommend. Free roomy parking. Friendly service! Menu on the smaller size and cohesive. I was told they change the menu from time to time. Today's had a hispanic trend. Drinks were good. I eyed another table's iced cold brew coffee and got one for myself. I suspect it was nitro cold brew or at least on draft because it had foam and was smooth. Don't even need to add cream or sugar. Mmm yum yum.Great portions and taste. Loved everything i bit into. If they're consistent on following visits, they'll get that last star!The biscuit and gravy took me by surprise. Had a curry twist to it and tasted good. Just not what i expected. The Syrniki or pancake cottage cheese mix was fabulous. I was putting fall into my mouth delivered via a textural pleasing pancake. The shrimps and grits were superb. Everything fit well together and the texture was great. The croque madam was savory but i felt like it was missing something. Maybe some heat? Then again my bite was small so i could've missed something. And the pastry board? Highly recommended.

The food was good. My husband ordered \"The Burger\" and I ordered the Roasted Mushroom Pizza. The burger was cooked perfectly and the special sauce that came with the fries was spicy and delicious. My pizza was the size of the dinner plate (maybe 12\"?) The middle of the pizza was soft and soggy and did not hold its shape. If you don't mind fork and knifing it then you'll be fine. Three stars because the price point was misleading. This should be $$$ and it shows up as a $$. Also, when I walk into a restaurant I want it to smell yummy. This place did not. It smelled... not yummy and kind of funky.It also bothers me that they charge $4.00 for bread.  However, our food came out super fast and the waitress was pleasant."}, {"review_id": "ovH3LhL9K1F8NPBBN8J1wA", "user_id": "RHhsg1I4uVq13NPZUQqY3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/21/2017", "text": "Beautiful decor.
