I usually go for a late lunch and they're never really packed then. It's always in pristine condition with people waiting to serve you. Each time I've gone, my service has been phenomenal! The servers are attentive and full of suggestions. They also have pretty good drink prices, though I've never indulged.Now to the best part, the food. I've had three different dishes the Thai Noodle (not pictured), Pad See Ew, and the Pad Spicy Basil, all with tofu. The presentation almost makes you not want to ruin it but you forget about that as soon as you taste the food. My favorite so far has been the Thai Noodle, it is most befitting to the description and you can get is a spicy as you want. I will say that the Pad Spicy Basil isn't very spicy but was still delicious enough to finish without complaint. And I can't help myself but to get the Spring Rolls every time I go. They are sooooooo good, always come out fresh, and pair perfectly with the sweet chili sauce."}, {"review_id": "a869JP0ZfNkBh0AgWz7DEQ", "user_id": "WYxchqcVrbit7jKpTOPDew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Food is phenomenal! Probably the best Asian restaurant in Mobile in my opinion. They have a nice selection of saki. Plenty of seating, didn't get over crowded. It's definitely worth a try, you'll be hooked. Lunch prices are very reasonable. Tom Kah soup is a must try!"}, {"review_id": "DE9MojPWoaaDus2qYn__ow", "user_id": "z1s-i-0g0XA19q_PAYhJaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "I'm from out of town.

I wanted brown rice sushi and this is the only place I could find it in Mobile. It was so delicious! The staff was so sweet and accommodating.

We have lived around the corner and kept hearing awesome reviews so we finally decided to try. Everything was amazing! My husband had the red curry pork and I had the Prik-Pao Chicken. We had enough for another meal. I also love that they didn't dumb down the kids menu. My daughter had the sweet and sour chicken which was also delicious!! They found out it was our first time and fixed us complimentary beignets!! Please do yourself a favor and try it! Don't let the strip mall fool you!"}, {"review_id": "mrmBETvSnN2NFnXW5uoXqQ", "user_id": "-8fbu1CHUR4bwv5dqwQH5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/10/2017", "text": "Delish! Grabbed a quick dinner after work with a couple of friends, and I have to say this place was great! The ambiance was quiet, very casual, and the service was phenomenal. We had the gyozas for an appetizer, had complimentary miso soup and house salad, and the pad thai. Prices are great- appetizers ~$5, entrees are ~$8-12, desserts ~$5. We also had the Mai Tai, which was good. Overall, we had a great experience and will be coming back!"}, {"review_id": "XHMsVBzsNnc0xgQtNbpfIA", "user_id": "wt0v3aFJMCWIX9y_S1Ucww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/3/2017", "text": "Panang was tasty. I ordered it mild and the portion wasn't too big so it was enough to take a serving home too. I like the sliced bell peppers in it. Nom sood had a little too much ginger,  it good nonetheless, I had the pork kind. Kids shrimp fried rice was a winner along with the appetizer sampler. Hubby enjoyed the salmon sashimi. Thai tea was good too. Good service and bathroom was clean.

This is one of them. Not just because the sushi is greats, though - because almost everything (which is a whole lot) we had off the menu was incredible. Fresh ingredients, genuine craftsmanship, and beautiful arrangement. This place accepts no substitutes! From the first bite of the Tom Kah Soup I could tell it was a genuine Asian dish. Perfectly balanced. We had the Edamame, which was fresh and snapped like it came right off the bean vine. We had the Tom Kah, which felt like it came shipped overnight from Thailand. We had the Volcano and Jersey roll. Just incredible. Would recommend to anyone who loves Asian Cuisine and original dishes."}, {"review_id": "U-gUhD9Tq3XtaFDvCBMEEA", "user_id": "o7xKeyGAWJOxin0aO6oe_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/10/2017", "text": "Dropped in here in search of some good vegetarian food and it was delicious!

These guys know how to cook and they use good quality ingredients. Their sushi is very fresh and the soups are excellent; rice and noodle dishes are freshly made and the egg rolls are the best I have ever had in Mobile. I have eaten in and have done a take out several times, and I have always been happy with every single meal.I know there are a couple new Thai/Asian restaurants in Mobile that are getting very good ratings on Yelp and Urbanspoon. I do not eat out much anymore, not in Mobile, so the few meals I chose beside my own cooking have to be fresh and delicious and Rice fills that gap perfectly, I do not even feel like taking a risk and going elsewhere. So those new places may thrive, but Rice is my go to place and I do not have to be concerned ordering tuna tataki or salmon sashimi."}, {"review_id": "nsUfei2PyFgqSkWR8RVA9A", "user_id": "Nxd8Y_PxzR_DBTK9IZV2cw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/29/2016", "text": "We keep coming back.
