My. Goodness.  This was a heavenly experience. My eyes must've rolled back in my head as I enjoyed this sweet overload of flavors.  Seriously incredible.  I was actually shocked at how much I enjoyed the Crepe filled with big chunks of banana and plenty of cinnamon.  I devoured the rest of the Crepe in like two minutes flat. It is probably a good thing that I don't live in Knoxville because I would be eating these Crepes way too often for my health.  On that note, I am already trying to plan a trip back to Knoxville to eat anotehr Crepe and enjoy the other local culinary delights."}, {"review_id": "SQc_lVGYmjRkpBYlNVSOEQ", "user_id": "VL57yiPYPJXX7ah3rV2K_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Step inside the Creperie and be whisked away to France. I love escaping here for everything from a quick latte and sweet treat to a full brunch spread. The owners have truly poured their love for everything Parisian into every detail of this restaurant. They have imported many of their offerings and everything is very authentic. Drinks are always made perfectly as ordered and the crepes are to die for. Their beer and wine selection is a nice offering with several local options. The decor makes my heart go pitter patter. They have limited patio dining. Their new location is so much nicer than their previous location on Gay St. This location is convenient to market square and makes it an easy spot for an after dinner treat. They offer free Wi-Fi. With great service, a charming atmosphere, and a vast menu, what is not to love? Hint: Impress your girl and bring her here for a romantic date night! She will be so impressed!"}, {"review_id": "qzj3a9FntN_XdET695yJJw", "user_id": "TrU49Ydk2ZMjlh0rtOVj7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "Checking out where the locals say to go for Sunday brunch before heading out of Knoxville. Parking is by street, surface, or garage. Street parking requires payment by meter, they good news is it takes credit card and is easy to use. Garage is a walk, there are several. Surface is a back lot that is not used on weekends. The staff would not say if it's ok to park in. I saw the owner pull in, so assume it it. The front walks were tidy.  Crepes, beignets and lattes at this downtown bakery was a perfect way to end my stay. The business is cute and laid out nicely with ordering lower level and seating. Upper level more seating and a fantastic table overlooking the downstairs and front door. There is merchandise for sale on the lower level. Ordering is at the counter. A young woman assisted me with the menu. How could I go wrong with warm beignets and a blackberry latte. Loved! Also had a Parisian Crepe (ham & cheese) that was on point. Service was a bit of a let down. It was not bad, it was not great, just there. I interacted with several staff. The chef in the kitchen was the most personable by far. I would recommend giving them a try, especially if you do not have beignets in your area. There's are authentic and over the top scrumptious. Cool place, but staff could use more energy."}, {"review_id": "TsJcSPztZkhCiLlhfld9DQ", "user_id": "12XYgZ6Am2CzaT78EZJVlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "The best crepes, whether sweet or savory!

The French market makes any girl feel like Audrey Hepburn the moment she walks in. The decor is on point with their theme, and you don't quite feel like you're in a scruffy city anymore. It's a great alternative to a coffee shop to offer some solace to get some mobile work done.The staff has always proved to be fantastic as well as the food. They offer a variety of sweets and lattes, but obviously their signature staple is there crepe. It has never disappointed. I keep telling myself I'll float into their savory crepe menu, but as always I end up opting for a sweeter fruit version."}, {"review_id": "9h04jg60dRhMSFVWXaff0g", "user_id": "RH-LwRWKwlBy4lO1-xRP7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I will be returning to Tennessee so that I can visit this restaurant again. When you walk in the decor of the restaurant immediately pulls you into the French cafe feel. The had macaroons and French pastries near the cashier that looked delicious. The woman who took my order was incredibly kind. I ordered a breakfast crepe that had scrambled eggs, Swiss cheese, tomatoes, and spinach. The crepe was perfect texture wise, just wish the filling had better seasoning (salt and pepper). This was a generous portion for breakfast.

I ordered the cheesy turkey and blueberry lemon curd crepe. The blueberry lemon curd crepe was pretty good but I don't think there was no lemon curd in the crate there was only a little bit of curd on top of the crate. The crispy cheesy turkey crepe was pretty good but I felt like it needed a sauce of some sort. Really cool atmosphere, they have two levels the decorations are really nice. They serve really good coffee as well. The menu is huge, there's lots of options and things to pick from.

Parking wasn't terrible, just need to keep an eye out for street parking. This crepe shop was popping on a Sunday morning! We strolled I'm closer to lunch time and there was a line that wound almost to the door. After changing my mind a dozen times, I ended up ordering a chocolate croissant (which they heat up for you), a latte and the Crepes Suzette. While the menu does warn you that the Crepes Suzette is topped with Grand Marnier, it does not warn you that you might get a litttttle tipsy - and they did not card me for my order. I would have thought they wouldn't just pour a straight shot of alcohol on my crepe so early in the morning, but hey, why not pre-game for the hike we were doing later, right? I wished they had reduced off the alcohol a little better. Overall, I was impressed by the cute little shop. There aren't many shops that specialize in solely crepes, so it's always fun to find one that does. Definitely a unique way to brunch!"}, {"review_id": "0qARuyhfDwD502kP-AY90g", "user_id": "qUKE0nnHWqPONoTYamb9mw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "New from California met a friend in town From New York for crepes here and we were both Impressed!!

Also got a vanilla latte and it was good too.Went with 2 others and our baby and it was not a problem for seating. Little tight with a stroller, but we made it work. Nice clean bathroom.
