My wife and I ate the 1/2 table feast ahhh, it was fantastic and plenty of food. Next time I am in Columbus this is my go to spot. My dad had the shrimp boat, which was great. Extremely pleased with the service and food. A nice relaxing place to have a seafood meal."}, {"review_id": "6ORnldZntj-Gtpa-Iva8gw", "user_id": "kz-dS3drJHclAMHVPYyhvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "While visiting our brother for his Airborne graduation on Fort Benning, my mission was to seek out local eats that were can't miss and Skipper's is definitely a must visit place. Owner Skipper greets you as if you're a regular upon entering and was a great host! After getting to know our group, he reviewed the menu with us and took our drink order. Very tasty Sweet Tea! He then took our appetizer and entree order. We chose the gator bites and fried green tomatoes. As someone who hasn't tried either before, I am happy I waited until Skipper's. Perfection. Tomatoes were crispy on the outside and perfectly tender inside. For the entree, we ordered the \"Table Feast\" which serves 3-4 guests and it was more than enough for four hungry veterans. Perfectly cooked and seasoned with Old Bay included potatoes, corn on the cob, crab legs, shrimp, and sausage. Very delicious and highly recommended if with a party!Overall, I thank Skipper for great service (he was our cook as well as our host.) and making us feel like a priority. There was no wait to sit and the food came in a surprisingly quick time yet was fresh and delicious. Make this part of your trip!"}, {"review_id": "VovrgOr0HR34WUe435mG3w", "user_id": "ya4LsFarKCae6xdSyLbwjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "What an awesome find!! We had traveled up to Columbus, GA in September '17 - running from Hurricane Irma. We got to Skippers late after our long drive from Ft Lauderdale. Thought we might be SOL but we were warmly greeted by Skipper's daughter! Skipper took great care of us and the food was outstanding!! Next time I find myself near Columbus, GA (and I pray it won't be because I'm running from another storm!), I going to make my way back to Skippers for some more of that legendary seafood!! Thank you Skipper!!"}, {"review_id": "qbWDiLn_i5B-g2XD8bikag", "user_id": "6umWDTj450qX5W5Y9Y6t7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Was worried at first because of its small size but don't let looks cool you. This place was delicious to the 10th POWER!!!! The owner greeted us and went over the menu which had a lot of food choices. Platters, low country boils, different crab, shrimp, poboys, you name it they had it. The fried green tomatoes were crispy but melted in my mouth and were full of flavor. I had the low country boil and it was perfect and the sausage was very flavorful.  Don't pass this place up."}, {"review_id": "ApbHCFLDy4xtFsxKp9bu0A", "user_id": "8hZTIif5IpgKEzZe8Z0KxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Insanely good food, great portions for the price.

This place was absolutely delicious. The food was hot and tasted very good, prices weren't too high, and Skipper prepared the food himself. He was extremely kind and friendly. I felt welcomed and he showed me to a seat and handed me a menu so that I was able to order to go. The food took a while to come out, but that's because it was prepared on the spot. Fresh food takes time, this isn't McDonalds. I'll definitely be coming back in the future and if you enjoy seafood, COME HERE. You're missing out if you don't."}, {"review_id": "-3Sd9WWByRQa2epa-hgHnQ", "user_id": "Uxm5RdnfEeuG6dTpH16EQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "What a gem of a find!

Cheap, delish, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Our group ordered the broil - huge sack of yumminess dumped out on the table. Just right, spices, flavor, textures, everything. On another occasion we orders the cooked oysters which are - holy hell - really good. Every city I live in, I try to find a seafood place comparable to Skipper's.

The staff was friendly the food was great. The drinks was also good. I have the gator bite and half of the sea food bucket. It was almost closing time but they forgot the eggs in our bucket but it's wasn't a problem to get a discount so I can deal with that. I asked about their military discount and I was told they had to do a lot of work to put in back into the computer but all we was going to do is add it to her tip.
