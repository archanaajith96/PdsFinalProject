Btw, it was the Restaurant's 8th Anniversary on our second visit and a nice selection of sweets were offered on the house for celebration. HAPPY 8th BIRTHDAY, Lazeez!  We wish you many more to come!"}, {"review_id": "qoiUXleoou7q7buTQiC-Ew", "user_id": "-xTAmslBDE_mq-6Kbxieag", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Heading to NY from Philly, with a quick business mtg in Allentown, wanted to grab a quick bite. I saw this place had great reviews a d had to try.I was told to get the Schwarma... Chicken or beef. I opted for chicken since I had beef the night before. I also upgraded to the combo because the sides were super pricey to begin with, so it made it worthwhile. I got the hummus since I feel like that is a good comparison side.Not great. The food was fine, but I didn't love any of it. Maybe I am just used to different flavors or something, but I wanted it to be more tasty. Even the hummus had a bitterness to it I didn't expect.The staff here is super nice, and the food is, well, fine. I can't give it less than three stars since it may just be an expectation thing."}, {"review_id": "-DjBUcN9QyAckT63Jm2CbQ", "user_id": "NMtqS7VzHwwNc6P7HkNC7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Everything we've tried from Lazeez has been fantastic!

The falafel was a little different flavor-wise than the Israeli falafel we are used to but very tasty served with tahini sauce, lettuce tomato & pickle. We also had a homemade baklava slice and were given two small tastes of a really yummy honey cake.  The owner made the rounds twice while we were there to make sure everyone was content. We were stuffed.

I had the chicken kabob with a garlic sauce and it was hands down the best I've had in Allentown PA. Chicken was moist and they didn't skimp on it either.

I have only tried them for lunch and never for dinner. Most often than not, I get the arnabeet (fried cauliflower) wrap which comes with a bit sized coconut cake dessert. The arnabeet along with the dash of sauce makes every bite of this wrap flavorful. The dessert which is drizzled with honey is excellent as well. I have also tried the chicken shawarma wrap which is great but the arnabeet wrap definitely is my favorite. Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "9d3L-d3Djy66EMsJtOgvkQ", "user_id": "FFYZxtflD-xSdw_LpJwe6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/29/2017", "text": "Found this place on Yelp as I was looking for a new lunch place in the area and enjoy Mediterranean food.

We started with the stuffed grape leaves and the hummus. The grape leaves were delicious. Perfectly seasoned and studded with bits of tomato. The hummus was creamy and was delightful with the pita chips. I got the beef shwarma, which was good, but my husband made ummy sounds all the way through his chicken shwarma. It was topped off with a dessert of a coconut cake that was a bit like a cornbread, soaked in a bit of honey. We also got baklava for home. You really can't go wrong here."}, {"review_id": "0TRGXoStMSO2q-bREp_1IQ", "user_id": "fdJvfNoCY9NqlqD2zVfOJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/17/2017", "text": "I can only fully comment on the Arnabit wrap, as that is the menu item I get every time I go because it's so darn good. Since the first time I discovered this delicious dish, I've had the opportunity to try it at other restaurants in the area that also serve Arnabit. None can compare to Lazeez's, especially not the wrap. The mix of flavors--salty, tangy, nutty, crunchy--means it's delicious from beginning to end. My favorite part of it is the addition of pickles--nice touch!Their grape leaves are also decent if you like the variety that is served in the juices. I prefer the ones that are slightly fried/grilled so it's kind of crispy."}, {"review_id": "R3G4D7RGbvXRZCaaAGA9zw", "user_id": "Zo_3-lp5o9t7DzujJkRp4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "Food: Delicious!
