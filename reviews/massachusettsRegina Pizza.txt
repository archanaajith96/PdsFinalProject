Service was fast and awesome; our server was a hoot and super fun. The ambience is really casual and laid back, and that's pretty much the vibe the staff was giving too. It's not a huge space but there's a decent number of booths and tables to sit down and enjoy your pizza in. Between the four of us we split one large pizza (the #14 - artichokes, mushrooms, pepperoni) and a pitcher of beer. The pizza was huge! Came out super hot and fresh. I thought the crust was absolutely amazing and my favorite part of the pizza. The artichokes were really tasty as well and I thought overall the crust to sauce to cheese to toppings ratio was pretty well balanced. I was pretty full after only once slice. Next time I don't think I would get the same toppings, but I would definitely come back time and again to try out other kinds...the menu is pretty expansive and there are a ton of options that it's pretty hard to figure out exactly what pizza you want. You can also build your own pizza on top of that, making it even tougher to decide what to do! No matter what you're craving for your pizza though, highly recommend checking this place out."}, {"review_id": "1zRGbKiuA9VI85iyHFrd8Q", "user_id": "oYyslnp5_NjycKTo-GfBZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Absolutely delicious pizza!  Yes on Friday night there is a line.  This isn't a big place.  It was orderly.  We probably waited 30 minutes at 7:30 pm.

It is Bostons oldest Pizzeria and was founded in 1926. During my two visits to Boston (Oct 2015 & Sep 2017) I came to Regina's for lunch. The first time, my wife had heard about Regina's and that it was \"the place\" to get pizza, so we checked it out. Our first impression: The line was wrapped around the corner and my wife and I looked at each other like, well it must be good if there this many people standing in line. The line moves quickly and because there was just two of us, a table for two opened up and we got seated before we even made it to the front of the line. We were in a small cozi booth and our server took our order. The pizzeria was slammed and everyone seated seemed to be having a good time. Our pizza was amazing and we both knew why this place has such long lines. During our second trip, we knew we had to come back to Regina's and relive the pizzeria experience. This time, the line was even longer and we were about 30 people deep from the front. The lines moves at a fairly quick pace considering there's not a ton of seating inside as it's a small restaurant space. The pizza the second time around was just as good as the first visit, if not better. This is definitely the go to place if you are in Boston and you are craving pizza."}, {"review_id": "WT628ydXQacQ3fm7HqYCgg", "user_id": "mDbW2WU6TIgbMoWyaaPaRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Regina Pizza is an old school family run pizza joint.

I snagged the bar seat closest to the window and enjoyed conversation with the old timer behind the bar who told me not to mess around and order a whole pizza to fully enjoy the crust of their old school pizza oven which had been seasoned and used for generations.At the end of the day the pizza was sublime, the beer was cold on tap, the feel was authentic in every way and the New Yorkers next to me were just as impressed.

I am VERY upset because I cannot eat their insanely delicious pizza every day of my life. Look, I'm from NYC. We're cranky and defensive and borderline homicidal about our pizza (also literally about everything else), but this stuff was good. Really good. Even better was the service.

They're simultaneously cursing each and every one of us out in their minds, while delivering stellar service. That's Boston right there. Tip 'em well ya cheap asses.

Holy cow, I'll be dreaming about this place for a very long time. On a tour-de-Boston, my local Bostonite friend/ tour guide stated from the get go that Regina Pizza was a must on our itinerary. The unassuming, hidden corner pizzeria is not what you'd expect. It's a little divey and very small. There will likely be a line outside to get in, but trust me when I say it's worth it. When I asked my friend to describe the pizza, she stated so poetically : \"It's not Chicago style...it's not NY style...it's just Regina's.\"She was right.On a Saturday night around 7, we waited about 30 minutes for our party of three to be sat which was remarkable considering it was dinner time in a hopping area of town AND the Pats were playing. Regina's offers two sizes of pizza : 10\" and 16\". Feeling ambitious, the three of us decided to order one of each - the Spinaci E Pomodoro: \"Regina's recipe pizza topped with fresh spinach leaves, cherry tomatoes, Pecorino Romano, Mozzarella, fresh basil and Regina's garlic and oil sauce\"and the Pollo Regina: \"Grilled chicken breast, Ricotta, Parmesan, Romano, Mozzarella Cheese, tomato sauce and roasted vegetables\"The pizzas were made fresh, so there was about 15-20 minutes of waiting for our pies. When they finally game to the table, I had a hardtime holding back. The Pollo Regina is a hearty, heavy pizza. After two slices, I was completely stuffed. I'm a huge lover of cheese, especially ricotta, and this pizza did not disappoint. It was, in my opinion, the perfect ratio of sauce and toppings. The Spinaci pizza was also very tasty - the toppings were clearly fresh, and that makes a difference. I was a big fan of both the sauce and the dough, two things I'm typically very picky about. Between the three of us, we had a lot of left overs to take home.Regina's isn't lying when they say they're \"world famous.\" They've been around for 90+ years, and it's clear why."}, {"review_id": "CsmxKkCdCRsw621_CSyz2g", "user_id": "frDoiRWbgsEyJa5ZnTUBrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "When people ask me what my favorite thing about Boston was, hands down Regina Pizza is my first thought and response. Walking down North End is an experience, the cute and condense brick buildings and all sorts of smells in the alleys. Then you get to Regina Pizza and it screams authentic. The signage, the wear and tear, the employees. This is the place to be. Our waitress, Patrice, made our dining at Regina ten times better. She was extremely friendly and helpful, and her Boston accent!! Adorable. She treated every table with the same hospitality and care. And of course, The pizza was SO FREAKING GOOD. We ordered a large because we knew we were going to destroy it. A small would have been just fine with two slices less than a large, but best believe we ate our leftovers for dinner! Everything about their pizza was fresh, flavorful and was a perfect combination. I think about this pizza often and how they changed the game. Everyone needs to experience a pizza joint like this.

I don't think it matters what I got here because I think whatever you decide to order, you'll end up very pleased. You can build your own pizza by choosing toppings, or choose from their Specialty pizzas. All are great and there is something for everyone!The only thing I will say though - if you're getting a specialty pizza that's heavy on toppings, get a large pizza. We got small pies and the middle of the pizza (tip of the slice) ended up super soggy. I just am not a fan of soggy crust.But overall, the ingredients were incredibly fresh, cheese was non-oily, and crust was (for the most part) crispy and delicious.
