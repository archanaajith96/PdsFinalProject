Some of the best Chinese food around. They have the standard Chinese dishes and a special Chinese menu that has real authentic dishes. We really like the Mapo tofu, the salt and pepper tofu with shrimp, and the eggplant and shrimp. Great service, clean modern setting, and of course great food. This my go to for Chinese."}, {"review_id": "KkRzpIsrzVhgDpf47DrjDg", "user_id": "D5GTlriu_vSoziqf4VQdlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Large house full of pals to watch recorded basketball game. Fortune Wok to rescue. Phad Thai,  fried rice Moo Shu twice, pork & chicken plus General chicken & a shrimp dish. Dinner was great w Famous Grouse scotch on crushed ice.  Called at rush hour 6:45 yet they were able to prepare our take out in time. Very efficient operation & service oriented staff. Awesome fresh flavors abound. Not cheap as we spent about $20. a person & had lots leftovers."}, {"review_id": "UBNR0N_6uQBj3F9Usd41eA", "user_id": "vHviadhmOmlwzw4nP2xrDw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Eh Chinese food all taste the same to me, HA! But I was surprised that our food was even better the next day. The only thing I didn't like was the Beef Chow Fun. It didn't have a flavor other than oil. The Mongolian Beef was good though! The rice didn't get all hardened the next day either. Worth trying.We did take out and it was ready in about 10 minutes. Hot and fresh!"}, {"review_id": "WgT-ntQzTZRS7VFsusMDyg", "user_id": "Z36rRXpIPsejlaHuc2q2Ag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "The food was excellent and it came out quick.

Will you still live really close and we have since moved, but have never found a Chinese restaurant that we like more. We make the drive for this restaurant. The lunch special is still amazing... Not the same price is 14 years ago but still a wonderful Valium. My favorite is still the sesame shrimp, but there always seems to be a wonderful special. The owner, Rick is around very often and very personable. Don't eat Chinese food anywhere else."}, {"review_id": "N49yndA4HKmL_A9OH3I6Lw", "user_id": "Aulf2V8Ok64Ebtbt3UCGdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Best Chinese in the city!

The inside of the business was nicer than I expected for a place located in a strip mall. I ordered the shrimp lo mein and my friend ordered the shrimp fried rice. We both thought they were just ok. The sauce on mine tasted a bit strange, and the shrimp were huge and rubbery. The egg drop soup they brought as part of the lunch deal had big chunks of chicken in it, which was surprising for me, because I had never seen chicken in egg drop soup anywhere. This isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu, so beware if you are vegetarian/vegan.The service here was good and our waters were refilled several times over the course of our meal. Overall, this wasn't a bad experience, but I wouldn't be quick to eat here again."}, {"review_id": "lN0rdP4WDAN9_0bWvnXF8w", "user_id": "CMPEGRGwUdLMbTlOvh1uyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Yummy!  This is definitely some of the best Chinese food I have ever had.  The chicken was awesome and the soup was great too.  Another great thing is that the portions are big and they have great prices.  I would highly recommend.  The only bad part is trying to decide what to get it all sounds so yummy it is hard to decide.  To sum it all up I will definitely return for a good solid meal!"}, {"review_id": "hqZcdKPvCzMkD2dCY-zVGw", "user_id": "edyYov80kIAsdYBU61DTPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "Somewhat challenging to find as it is hidden in a strip center at 135th and Nieman in Overland Park, but well worth the hunt! Very tiny restaurant inside but what they lack in size they make up for with flavor. Haven't had a bad meal here before and the crab Rangoon is exceptional. Great for a take away option as well. A little more expensive than nearby competitors, but you get what you pay for and the extra few dollars is well worth it."}, {"review_id": "ArrUDXgVt18aXSxzKxfRYg", "user_id": "kQ1PhXLvhJz0Xz5DmQ6YCw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/18/2016", "text": "This place NEVER lets me down! Their food is awesome, and is consistent (which I've recently found very important). It's very close to work so we bop over on long days when we need an escape! My picky coworkers even find something they like ok the menu, which is sometimes rare with 11 of us! The lunch specials are awesome (Orange Chicken ftw), and they're usually pretty open at lunchtime, so seating is never an issue. My only complaint is I wish they either had online ordering, OR allowed you to pay over the phone individually. -again, this is only a problem when we're figuring out things for lunch."}, {"review_id": "l-4KINvxVqXgaUO5Yt5BGA", "user_id": "qA0aaSN5HL99fjID_pzfGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/24/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm so pleased to see that I had already written a review for this restaurant (eight years ago).  They are still fantastic!  A friend and I went here a couple of days ago and had a great experience.  We ordered edamame and fried pork dumplings for the appetizer.  You can't really mess up edamame - it was fine.  The dumplings were THE BEST I've ever had.  They were twice the size that you'd find at other restaurants, and they tasted so good!!For my entree, I ordered the Mongolian Beef.  Other reviewers have said it's too sweet.  I thought the sauce was just right.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  My friend had the Pineapple Fried Rice.  It was so righteous.Our server was very friendly and helpful.  I'm giving them an upgraded rating, and I'm also going to say this is my new FAVORITE Chinese restaurant in the KC Metro!  I'll be back to try some other dishes.  Can't wait, actually!"}, {"review_id": "MeTX3OFuhJgx_PatDZZceQ", "user_id": "7zZtzGk6UVANeMOpPmFT5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "Great food!

Which you'd think would be plenty of time.Still, no one took our order. So, we got up to leave. The food was really pricey, most servings were $12 per person or more. As we are leaving, the lady at the register says \"Are you leaving?\" and I told her we were. That we'd been waiting for a long time, several employees had come past our table, but never took our order.

I believe that it may have been better eaten inside. I enjoyed the fried rice and crab rangoon. But the orange shrimp had to much breading for my taste. This was my biggest problem, I went to the website to check out the menu and prices. Of course no prices listed anywhere. I hate places like this, no specific price so they can charge what they want when they want. $25 for orange shrimp, fried rice, and crab rangoon. Won't rush back.
