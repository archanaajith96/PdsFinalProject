The water was delicious. Definitely filtered. I drank a ton of it. So refreshing. I really like water, so when it's bad, it's evident. This was good stuff. The seafood was good. Nothing stellar about the crab cakes. I tried the broiled and the fried(?). They don't waste space with fillers, but the broiled one was definitely more delicate than the latter. For dessert, we had bread pudding. Two large pieces were presented as one dessert. However, they were stingy with the whisky sauce that complemented it. Without the sauce, it was more like a slightly dry cinnamon raisin bread. Tasty flavor though. I'll be back for dinner, since this was a lunch experience. A good one, but I wanted rockfish or scallops and that's only after 5pm."}, {"review_id": "See8R30VvL3Z_XrTuC4tnw", "user_id": "ygBwLI9n_uH29qKgWOiqVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "This was a recommended restaurant from one of my professors.   It was sorta out if the way.  Back in Chesapeake somewhere.   But w navigation found it no problem.  Did not look like a dive at all.   Had a nice bar.  Service was attentive.  Yummy tuna.   The bread pudding was good, unique toasted like a french toast almost.

My only suggestion would to add a bit more crab either on top or the bottom. I ordered the crab cake dinner.  They were nice size,  there was barley any filler and was seasoned well.  It also came with grean beans and potato wedges.

The restaurant is not too large, but they have tables that can accommodate up to 6 people, so groups are encouraged! We were seated in the dimly-lit back surrounded by nautical paintings and photographs. This place has a great atmosphere for a date night and/or celebration! For appetizers, we ordered the mussels which came in a garlic wine butter sauce and was absolutely incredible. For $12 you get a gigantic bowl (1.5 lbs) of mussels that is great to have as a meal itself, or to share between 2-3 people. Don't forget to dip the crispy crostini in the delectable buttery wine sauce. Yum. We also ordered a single serving of the shrimp cocktail which was also very good! I just thought $12 was just a tad on the expensive side for 6 shrimps. One thing that I was quite disappointed in was the half dozen raw clams. The clams came out and were INCREDIBLY tiny! I have never seen a clam so small haha. It looked as though the inside had already been eaten honestly. We expressed this concern to our waitress and she notified us that they are, in fact, medium sized clams and not the largest they offer. From the tiny bite I tasted, the flavor was great! But, next time I'd probably steer clear of those and maybe order some raw oysters instead. For my entrée, I ordered the crab stuffed salmon which came with garlic mashed potatoes and yellow squash. WOWOWOW ! This dish was mouth-wateringly good. I wasn't even that hungry and I ended up finishing my entire dish. The salmon had a perfect crispy outside, the squash was seasoned to perfection, and the garlic mashed potatoes were nice and chunky with a ton of garlic flavor! Please try this if you patron Off the Hook!! I was also able to try the scallops as well, and they were awesome and literally some of the biggest I've ever seen served at a restaurant. The scallop entrée comes with 6, and trust me you will get full! We shared the tiramisu for dessert and it was as expected and quite delicious. Can't wait to come back to try their award winning crab dip and some fish tacos!"}, {"review_id": "_ESunu6DYVlR4n4iwSKvLg", "user_id": "kIP8f4AGBLvB6I4hR7zjew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "We were traveling, staying the night in Chesapeake and were ready for a nice meal.  We went here based upon Yelp reviews and we were very pleased.  We had She Crab soup and Oysters Rockefeller for starters and both were delicious.  We opted for stuffed flounder and stuffed salmon for our main courses.  Both were amazing.  All the seafood was fresh, the atmosphere was upscale casual and the service was very friendly.  It was a great stop after a long day on the road.  Should we be traveling this way again, Off the Hook would be our first choice for dinner!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/off-the-hook-seafood-restaurant-chesapeake-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
