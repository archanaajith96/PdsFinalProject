Great concept. However nachos may not be the best to nosh on while watching a movie as they are a loud food during a seeming quiet suspense scene. Not a first date place at all but great for a \"I don't want to watch a movie at home but want good food\".

Great food that tastes fresh and rarely disappoints.I still don't get why it costs $5 to add chicken to a salad here but at Mtooth it's way less... like $2-3. Oh well it's something I can get past.

I was a bit confused with the food situation and how to order, no one really welcomed new comers and explained the process which would be nice, or the friendliness of the staff could have been a little better. Food is not something you come here for but it's just the overall setting. I can say I tried it and more than likely won't return."}, {"review_id": "BRFUkoyTWV6-NXmz6dxiAA", "user_id": "xV7PqO_S7eDpLTcY7SfAOQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Is good place to hang out and the pizza is just ok to me cos I'm not a pizza guy.The snack is pretty good so far"}, {"review_id": "4VyIc0zJQrcwfhFzOzfwdw", "user_id": "g-m2B9fwfzz5MZAEQL2ZXA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've had Good and not so good experiences at the Bear Tooth but last night I placed a rather large to go order and everything was perfect . As usual the place was packed and when I called in my order I was told the wait would be 45 min to and hour . My order was ready in 59 minutes . I can't complain because I was told ahead of time how long the wait would be and it was accurate and the food was delicious . They have some great specials right now and I had a blackened salmon taco with a mango salsa and avocado . It was so good I might go back tonight .Also their beer choices are superb !"}, {"review_id": "hIe1HwBkpa0TOF0kQeLopg", "user_id": "YN8OE9aHcu2t617ccMHVBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Excellent  food and beverage service.  Love to see watch a movie and eat gourmet food."}, {"review_id": "5ENyyqAiKGlqLDAXy_11Xw", "user_id": "N_As5tbImRo3LwHKyqBHBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Who knew you could great Mexican food and margaritas this far from LA?  Wife had a fancy rosemary burger and I had the carne asada tacos.  We're both gluten intolerant and BTTP had us covered with the GF menu.  Margaritas are amazing!  Service was just right; friendly, sincere and on pace.  Atmosphere and vibe are lively and fun without being overwhelming.  In town for business and would recommend and return!"}, {"review_id": "WCMakCPQ2I6EfNR_fG9r0w", "user_id": "Ev0ljWWg1pWJJfw7ioYREQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "I.  Love.  This.  Place.  I'm not in Anchorage very often but all the Tooth restaurants are on my list!  Bear Tooth is a eatery and theater.  Dinner and a show for the family or a quick date night.  The food is spot on.  If you leave here hungry, you're not doing it right.  Party of 3 in for a quick lunch and we were not disappointed.  The other side of the restaurant was full with a long waiting time but the theater side had a table ready to go.We had chips and salsa for an appetizer.  Very well done salsa with a tiny kick.  I had a burrito the size of my face and table mates had wings.  The wings had that fragrant odor of \"bout to bring some heat\" and I might have had a little bead of sweat on my lip.  Perfect.  The burrito was good and I would get it again.The place is a little tight and the booth seating needs a bit more space between the seat and the table.  We made it in but the seating was just tight."}, {"review_id": "q-8LyTJ3fI_4t7cYC0HsKw", "user_id": "0S_i96G5FR7oYO3QeH_01Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Ok that last two times I ate at Bear Tooth were an improvement over previous experiences.   One meal was on the nice side and one meal was with coworkers on the ghetto side.  Ghetto side selections are way more limited, so one has to order carefully.  Margarita was good- just enough kick and a good size. And the roasted brussel sprout salad was delish.  On the nice side, the pear bellini was soooooooooo yummy.  And i got this insane fall orange and pumpkin soup.  Dear lord it was heavenly.... too bad it was a seasonal special.  I could eat that stuff every day.I live right around the corner, so if I had to deal with the bullshit parking situation at Bear Tooth, I definitely wouldn't bother.  But since I can walk and I'm a lot more familiar with what they do well and what they do not do well, I am much more pleased with my overall experiences when I dine at Bear Tooth."}, {"review_id": "yP7Ixvd90WF3qZsZceqPfg", "user_id": "GYuDtuvdKb4hDZX_oXdwlQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "There is always something wrong with their food now.

Five bucks to see a movie on the big screen (Rogue One in 3D), popcorn and boutique beer on tap.

It is a credit to their formula that many would rather wait to see a new-ish movie here than to visit a regular cinema to see a current feature upon release. I will happily spend $50 or more here for tickets, food, and drink before visiting Century 21 a few blocks away for a $40 set of tickets, greasy popcorn, and banal sodas."}, {"review_id": "n_H70RmV9CTNzn8YivnjtQ", "user_id": "UH7MP6ZE4AhiS5cRdVJ4yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/26/2017", "text": "I'm completely obsessed with the avalanche pizza and the white pizza.

I was a little gun shy given the previous experience with the \"special\" Vegan\" nachos. My wife decided to give them a try and I had 2 bites and wished I would have ordered them myself. They definitely earned an \"A\" for concept and execution. I hope this becomes part of their regular menu! The sauce was smooth and flavorful and know even non Vegans would love this dish as well.We would like to thank the Bear Tooth team for providing an excellent upscale dish for people with dietary restrictions."}, {"review_id": "dt2BZjuguiMebNlssb20Iw", "user_id": "Sn1otdXMqPs38ehgWcZLow", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "We had great expectations due to how packed the restaurant was and the yelp reviews. We were let down. There is nothing particularly special about this place. The atmosphere is decent, and they have a huge bar menu...which may be why most people visit. However, all of the food on our plates was under seasoned and bland. The only highlight was the steak in the carne asada tacos, which was actually cooked and seasoned well. The guacamole tasted like nothing but avacado, no salt or lime. Over all the experience was just...eh. We may give it another try at some point, and hope for better."}, {"review_id": "nYF_N-t-aDc9o4-P_bGKJg", "user_id": "54gTyZDW4zZ9G4eCo4mzqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "We love this place great time had here with the fam we try to come whenever a good family movie is playing we are regulars"}, {"review_id": "dvqjB1YXOjuN7cB7MwhwOg", "user_id": "1uH05Bk1VYbxb5T0YvTz-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Though overflow parking is often needed, Beartooth is always an enjoyable time. I like sitting adjacent to bar side because the wait is typically less. I like how the two sides have a slight difference in menu. And the theatre itself is a treat. To dine with food and beverage is complete with a cone of brought to service. Come one, come all, enjoy the show.
