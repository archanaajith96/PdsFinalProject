Going to a diner I thought it would be simple offerings but wow what a menu. I had a mexiburger that was featured on triple Ds. I was impressed with the green chili flavor. The portions are large and fairly priced which is another plus driving my star rating up. Our server was really cool and helped me navigate the options. My counterpart had the Colorado philly that got a thumbs up as well. The fries were great and their ranch is yummy. The onion rings were awesome as well so you will have to decide on your goodies."}, {"review_id": "kw_nrIH6i6xKweEBOipbMQ", "user_id": "J40Cy_34FAc57xXKzPVQPg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "We fell in love with Sam's No.3 at the location off of leetsdale and we were so happy to find one close to us in Aurora! But every time we visit the Havana location the food come out cold or not correct to the order or we have to go to the bar and ask the bartender to ask the server to bring us the items we asked for. 2 stars for service I'd list zero for food quality. Whomever is the kitchen manager really needs to have a chat with their staff. As a professional chef the regular lack luster performance is a sign of bad management. We paid for our food and left it uneaten and we won't be returning to this location."}, {"review_id": "j5-WZUUuA2Cnm-wyNwCfmQ", "user_id": "g2QDn0pbNAJaOfFcEEFhsw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "We have been going here since 2007.

I started off with my first ever snickers latte & it was amazing. It tasted just like a snickers! I then chose the bison breakfast burrito as my main course & it blew me away. It was not only ginormous, but packed with flavor. It contained loads of bison with the optional turkey sausage & those fresh jalapeños to give it that spicy kick I love. The menu here is packed with amazing options & don't be shocked if there's a long wait before you get in. This spot is popular, but sooo worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "y3JNJeY5kGhrYSrY9z0zVQ", "user_id": "lJ-Ep4vR0lCC4MYp0Pvc4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "A pretty nice diner within walking distance of where I live.For all the hype this place gets I  had expected more, but what I got was in no way disappointing.The staff is friendly and answer any question asked of them and the menu is one of the bugger ones I have encountered.The food itself is tasty and come in decent sized portions, the prices vary from cheap to relatively expensive (for a diner).I still come here every now and again to try items because the menu is so diverse, if nothing else its a good time trying new things."}, {"review_id": "t3G84b1vFDny9j3SOBz0aw", "user_id": "09wYqAAPhTWlpZ0KU2b55w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "HOLY BURRITO!!!

I'm a fan!\"++ It's your typical diner atmosphere with a definite Denver Broncos twist. Stopping in on a Sunday game-day the fandom is very real (jerseys and gear everywhere)!++ While it may be small, they do feature a patio space that I highly recommend taking advantage of. Given our unseasonably warm November, my recent visit found my friend and I outside soaking it all in!++ They offer those boozy brunch favorites: bloody Mary's and mimosas! While they aren't anything fancy - they're traditional and satisfying.++ The food is fantastic and portions are LARGE! So make sure you come hungry! I've had the Kitchen Sink Burrito and it's no joke. Def large enough to split if you aren't famished. The pork green chile is sooo good! Smother everything!! Sam's No. 3 will def be in my best brunch rotation for sure!**Pro Tip: Keep your receipt! They offer you a discount on your next visit if you bring it in! Yay!!"}, {"review_id": "1HM_dlJrrldtUxFeSzToEA", "user_id": "TojOTNaMX9-LFuMug9Sq5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "This is a solid place for breakfast/brunch, lunch or dinner. They have a lot of variety of not only food but also a full bar. My most recent experience was what motivated me to write a review. I went in last weekend for breakfast and since the first of the year I have been limiting the amount of meat I eat so decided I would look for a vegetarian option. Our server who addmittedly is a meat man pointed me in the right direction with the veggie skillet, it was delicious! I am picky about the way I like my eggs cooked and was not disappointed. King was our server, he was awesome and kept the antioxidant mimosas flowing. Will definitely be back again!"}, {"review_id": "Is1GRU6SmP6GPkr0YZCAdg", "user_id": "Amf1jsCdfUO0ROaERo3ECw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Great. Delicious. Affordable. Big parking lot. Lots of options \"On Havana Street\" but Sam's No 3 Aurora is always busy day and Night. We dined for breakfast/brunch at 10am-11am on a Thursday during spring break week. Lots of early bird options under $8 for lots and lots of food!  I enjoyed the 4 bacon, toast, hash browns, and scrambled eggs. We also ordered French toast and a side of bacon. Both of our orders came out in 10 min and our bill including a 20% tip was $21.

Here's the breakdown: STAR 1 = The food is bomb. 100% awesome. Their menu is extensive, full of unique options, portions are huge and the flavors are out of this world! The hubs and I chose to split the \"Poppa's big as a house\" burrito which was HUGE - filled with eggs, ham, sausage, gyro, onion, bell pepper, tomato, mushroom, cheddar, swiss and a mix of cheeses - smothered in green chili! holy yum!! I could easily order anything on this menu - as everything looked/smelled delicious!! STAR 2 = Staff is killer - and have everything down to a well oiled machine. Despite being super busy on a Sunday morning, everything went smooth! The host took our name promptly, the bartender poured us great drinks, we were seated before our quoted wait time, our waitress came as soon as we sat down, gave us great suggestions and made sure our waters were never empty! Food came out promptly and split for us! :)STAR 3 = Location is great - right off Havana, just up the road from Kennedy Golf Course. Surrounded a few stores and other restaurants, you'd think parking would be limited, but it's not! The lot is huge, and creates plenty of room for everyone!!STAR 4 = Vibe is relaxed and chill - and most people at the bar top appeared to be regulars, giving advice to newbies like me, and conversing and laughing with staff. It felt as though I was hanging out at a house party where everyone knew each other !STAR 5 = BOOZE!!! Their menu is quite extensive and offers just about everything! I opted for a mimosa - that featured peach vodka, champagne and grapefruit juice - creating the perfect refreshing mix! The boys chose screwdrivers, while my mom opted for a spicy bloody! The drinks were perfectly crafted and STRONG! mmmmm! Guy Fieri was right - in saying this place has some of the best breakfast in town! It's obvious to see why!! Can't wait to return!"}, {"review_id": "2qcNHYkDugmEArIPUWNYBg", "user_id": "BV9_RR2sI5Kx0lVHsQjUng", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Went for lunch got a hand held burrito and hubby got the veggi burrito it was good the staff was on the slower side would like to go back and give another review as this was just a quick in and out lunch"}, {"review_id": "W-VrtO1e6z00i0AsUpl2Vg", "user_id": "owzPNL0Uw7LnhL3sYTYm_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Sam's has great food and great drinks. I mark it down from 5 to 4 because it has very consistently spotty service whether they're busy or not.My personal favorite thing on the menu is the macho burrito. Spicy, smothered, and a huge burrito. It's definitely worthwhile. The larger your party is, the better chance that your burrito and everything else ordered for you table will come out maybe warmish/maybe cold.The staff is always nice, and I have nothing against them at all. I'm just not a fan of going out of my way to dine at a restaurant, waiting 40 minutes in the lobby, and getting cold food. If you're really looking to give it a solid experience, I'd recommend dropping in earlier rather than later, and weekdays are definitely better than weekends."}, {"review_id": "J4kmSXcZVh09tsMWzTzKFA", "user_id": "6NQAoeUgsxoAr31NVJGxTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "Another 5 star experience in Denver! I loved Sam's No 3.We strolled in just a few minutes before 10 AM on a weekday and were seated in a small, cozy booth right away. I immediately saw the weekday before 10 am special and my friend and I jumped on the opportunity. He got the #7 steak and eggs ($8.99) and I got the #2 including 2 eggs, sausage, hash browns, and toast (5.99). We got a side of pancakes to split, as well. HOW CAN YOU BEAT THOSE PRICES?!Needless to say, we went to TOWN. And everything was delicious! We loved our brunch here and were in and out in under an hour.

First and last time I will ever come here. The food was not bad. I would give it a 4/5. But the service was just horrible. The waitress serving us definitely had some prejudices towards us for some reason. I think it was because we are of indian decent. The place was mostly white. We were the few people of color there. When our food arrived she slammed our plates. Then my dad politely asked her for a side plate and she very loudly said \"OK SIR!\" Literally the whole restaurant could hear it. She was not talking like that in that tone to the people sitting next to us who were white. She was making small talk, laughing, etc. I will never come here again.
