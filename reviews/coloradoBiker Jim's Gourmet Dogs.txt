I was obsoviously nervous about the different game meats available but I was going to let that stop me now that I finally had the chance to try one. I opted for the Elk Dog and it was better than I could have ever expected! The standard toppings make complete sense as well. This was one of the few times I have ever been speechless while eating something as simple as a \"hot dog\". It was such a great meal. I would highly recommend checking out the cart when you can. It would be a shame if you were just visiting Denver and couldn't grab one of the gourmet dogs."}, {"review_id": "pV5Vf62Sruvn3u9KGP_FHw", "user_id": "iP9NCp6If6YnlOc2QeDqeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/2/2017", "text": "I don't often eat or have a particular interest in hot dogs so I didn't really know what to expect but it sounded fun and like the tasting would be nice at least.After AN AGE considering the menu which has so many interesting options I decided to go nuts and have the pheasant and rattlesnake dog. The meat was fantastic - juicy, flavoursome, just like chicken (jk!). My toppings were also FANTASTIC - so much going on, at one point I was like ermagherd I forgot there was even going to be bacon in this haha. The topping I got was the conspiracy: bleu cheese, bacon, red onion marmalade, lemon aioli, and french fried onions. You can see how well put together that is in terms of texture and bite versus sweetness.It was one of those meals where I was sad I had to be alone so I had no one to yell THIS IS AMAZING to through a mouth full of food. I even liked the bun, and I am not a bread fan! I was literally texting my family and boyfriend while still eating telling them how good it was.Staff and owner were super friendly and despite being very busy I did not have to wait long for my food. I liked that they had high bench areas suitable for solo dining without being conspicuous/taking up a whole table.I would definitely recommend this place and wish I could somehow end up in Denver again soon to eat there again."}, {"review_id": "oJcPEDinp_nb3JHrKyn_1g", "user_id": "Ga-GgpzBhTqTTixqgAN6tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/30/2017", "text": "I was a bit weary about Biker Jim's because the prices seemed a bit steep for a hot dog, but one night, I headed over to grab some food before heading home, and I was impressed!

I've finally made my way there. My cousin used to tell me how great his hotdogs were when he used to sell them out of his cart downtown. So when he expanded his business I was even more interested in trying one of these famous dogs. I enjoyed the happy vibes in this place. Im not a soda drinker but I loved the fountain drink variety. Also digged the condiment stations. I usually don't care for fried Mac n cheese but I was feeling it that day. They were delicious! Perfect seasoning and fried coating on the outside and still cheesy and warm on the inside. My dog was great. I think it took me so long to come here because I don't really ever crave a hotdog, it's just not my go to. I think for the ppl that enjoy a dog and beer, it is a great place to check out. Especially the downtown location perfect for all those Rockies fans. I'll definitely be back, I have a few other flavors I'm looking to try."}, {"review_id": "hT9COP4NFD3wPkEOEFZrrQ", "user_id": "tThF6yvQGLEtEN_uFP8ykg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/15/2016", "text": "I used to live in Denver and would stop at this cart quite often on my lunch break.  I had the reindeer dog seattle style with cream cheese and carmelized onions.  Nothing else is needed for this amazingness.  Chips and a drink with it all under $10 - can't beat that.  My friend really loved the jalapeno dog as well.  The guy working that day - not sure if it is always the same guy - was super fun and friendly.  Joking around with us and having a good time.  We originally wanted bacon wrapped dogs but those are only available at the real restaurant - not on the carts - FYI.Love it!"}, {"review_id": "lX_4msOAUT7ZZqzaAn07Hg", "user_id": "uJBo6pdDJ1oF4hCDjkrrNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "I am not usually a big hot dog fan, but I could eat biker jims everyday!

He's been grilling here for 10 years. It all started with Jim, the owner, and Justin has been here for 2 years now.  He is open from 11ish to 2:30ish, Monday through Friday. There's plenty of seating and tables within the plaza.  He even takes credit cards via Square.The meat selection is awesome with eight choices from sweet, savory, spicy, smoky to vegan.  I had the sweet Wild Boar with cream cheese and grilled onions. It was absolutely amazing and the 4.5 star rating is accurate.  I had a taste of my wife's Alaskan Reindeer and it was very tasty with a smoky flavor. The service was quick without nonsense, as it should be. This is a great place to recharge when walking about or a quick lunch during a busy work day.  I can't wait to check out their restaurant few blocks away!"}, {"review_id": "b_EdarUb9FRLX8GGUkaVpw", "user_id": "sOzeK0dE0BYx4Mc8dmoenQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/31/2015", "text": "Look for the green umbrellas, blue tables and chairs in the same plaza as the Exclusive Resorts building. If you're still lost look for the 16th St Mall St sign and  Arapahoe then you're right where the hot dog cart is.The cart has been on this location for 10 years. If you're new like us he will guide you by asking you for your flavor craving of the day. I wanted something smoky and lucked out by choosing the Alaskan Reindeer dog. The man Justin who mans this corner for two years now can cook a dog in under 2 minutes. I chose cream cheese only on mine. Although you can add freshly sautéed onions if you want .  I wanted to taste the dog as is. One of the best. Pops when you bite and juicy all the way. Although he slices his dog in half- to save on cooking time? It's still really good. The sit down restaurant where they serve burgers is about six blocks down."}, {"review_id": "cyfV4Pot0CTSabZAvjpsqw", "user_id": "z_Z5DfNuA8UhThmzlsepNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "Most amazing hot dog I have ever had I am never disappointed love love love this place and staff is so fun and amazing yum love the guy that grills out on auraria campus he is the best"}, {"review_id": "xOFRwMDYTpj76edYqBdNyw", "user_id": "mIMZ72MQA-Bvj80bK8182A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/2/2017", "text": "This is not your average wiener.

If your a fan of trying something different and love hot dogs to begin with this is the spot. Even if your not a fan of hot dogs this is still the spot.
