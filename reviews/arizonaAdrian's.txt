The food here probably won't improve your boxing physique but it's comforting and filling. The restaurant itself is in a more run down part of Mesa right next to a small mobile home park. The restaurant is pretty small too, I saw maybe 5 tables for dine-in guests. I had been craving chilaquiles all weekend. Since I was in the area after an appointment, I figured I'd try them out from Adrian's since it had been on my bookmarks list for a while. The chilaquiles is probably one of the most expensive things on their menu at a little over $10 after tax, but they pack a lot of food in your order. I got 2 eggs, refried beans, a generous serving of tortilla chips with red sauce, some pieces of thin steak, tortillas, and salsa. It didn't take too long for them to make it and I was ready to go back home and enjoy my breakfast feast!When I opened up my to go box it looked like a hot mess but it was a delicious hot mess. The eggs were perfectly cooked, with a lovely runny yolk. The tortilla chips were lightly crisp, and while the steak was fairly tender and I saw seasoning on it, it wasn't as flavor-packed as the rest of the meal. Service was cheerful and friendly."}, {"review_id": "e0UVe9XZzNPW8cMKPiPdAg", "user_id": "qXluJ1U_aaFBzcEeTWt8Qg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "Had the Machaca with eggs for breakfast. It looked like a hash, and tasted great! Small dining area and they close early, but the staff is friendly and the food was good. I particularly enjoyed the refried beans and the seasoning on the breakfast potatoes. The salsa was also flavorful. I spooned it on everything."}, {"review_id": "79Jg92eNY4T6NqJAIrT4ww", "user_id": "MzLIqKufqHlZpkxeW9sKPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2016", "text": "Ever since we found we were moving to this area I've been craving some really *good* mexican food.   I found this place on my trusty Yelp app and figured we'd give it a try.  Its a tiny little shack of a place, with 6 tables.   I liked it immediately.   It has a little charm and style that fits the faire.   Its small, but clean.   I wasn't in the mood for Mexican food out of a strip mall..The management is very friendly and personable.    So far, so good.   My wife ordered the chimichanga and I'm always a sucker for carne asada platters.    They were excellent!   Everything tasted home made and built for flavor, including the beans and rice.   My wife, who is usually pretty picky loved her meal as well.  They did a steady stream of lunch take out orders while we sat and ate, and I can see why.   This place is doing EVERYTHING right, and we will definitely be back.  I definitely recommend!"}, {"review_id": "hFsdCv5j84oiVE52_ZNbjA", "user_id": "T1TI-1x4TJB7V-nJhaP_NA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Don't blink or you'll miss this little gem.

The food is so delicious!! I talked to the lady when i picked up our food and she said they've been there 21 years and it looks like they get rave reviews for their delicious grub over the years. I feel like everything tasted authentic and my idea of Mexican \"soul food\". Definitely cured a bit of a hangover! The inside is small and quaint but i feel like they could take a day and clean it up real good. Still five stars because it was just that good."}, {"review_id": "_AWsP9wD1pEyrDAvJgBySg", "user_id": "Czj0uNdClDE2r8o5Ca-PNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "What a find! I stumbled across Adrian's when I Yelped \"homemade tortillas\". I was looking for a good breakfast burrito. This place is small and tucked away but the food is amazing! More importantly, the staff is fantastic. The owner kept bringing samples of food for us to try so now I have a list of things I have to go back and try. I have never been a menudo fan despite my love of Mexican food, but I left there with a to go bowl of menudo. They clean it super well so it doesn't have that smell, and if you're anything like me the smell is what kills it for me.

I have tried several places. I finally stopped when I found Adrians. Most places the egg to potato ratio is too high to the bacon but this place has the perfect mix. If you want a good spice, the red salsa is to die for. The only downside is that they are closed after 4 but this place is the perfect stop for a heavy lunch so you can eat a lighter dinner. The workers are there are very very reasonable. I can't wait to go in and eat there. Keep in mind there are only a couple of small tables but the food there is totally worth it.
