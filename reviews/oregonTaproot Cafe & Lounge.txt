It sounded good to me when I read the menu, and the reality exceeded my expectations. I had been worried the jam would be overly sweet, and while it added a depth to the overall flavor, I never had a bite that actually tasted sweet. Many places use potatoes in a breakfast burrito as a cheap filler, but Taproot kept a nice balance with the bulk of the filling being eggs, with enough well-seasoned potatoes to add some texture. The burrito was well-seasoned, and I didn't feel the need for my usual dips or hot sauces.Service was friendly and quick. Thanks!"}, {"review_id": "KDkA1R3HORZwfYI3vq_fkg", "user_id": "vTvdizHJ1P6TC-70o-mg-g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Good coffee, but not good enough to justify the rationing employed here.While you can get a cup of coffee soon after you are seated, do not expect it to be refilled. You can ask, and will be politely told that they will be right back with more. That doesn't happen.It does seem that the servers have enough time to brew coffee and provide refills - the food takes a ridiculously long time to arrive. I am not sure how it takes 30 minutes for under-cooked pancakes and scrambled eggs when there are only 3 tables occupied in the restaurant.After three assurances from the waiter that he would be 'by with more coffee' - almost like he would be doing us a favor on his way to work - he arrived with not one, but two thermoses of coffee. Sadly his multi-thermos haul only provided for 1 and 1/2 cups of coffee for our two cups.If the coffee supply is so precious to this restaurant, perhaps they should specify that $2.50 buys you exactly one cup of coffee (1 1/2 or 2 if you are both persistent and lucky)"}, {"review_id": "PlSXPypcmxD8WM4VVWnCgA", "user_id": "PK9bJchNjvj5xs2YL9NDsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Taproot is one of the great Salem places.

The food was hot and fresh although it would be special if the tortillas were made in house.  If fresh made can't happen, then flour would be better.  Store bought corn tortillas bring down the quality of everything else. I took to the flavors right and for me was spiced up a little differently which was a treat. The service was swift, attentive, genuine and made me want to come back.  Same goes with the decor and environment as far as making me want to come back.  The place is casual and sensory wise, delightful!I will come back for a weekend breakfast."}, {"review_id": "R6o6j1DiPP8yaAONrKJASg", "user_id": "nbPN5ahpmR0wdObhZsf6xg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "Been in for breakfast a couple of times and have really enjoyed the food and service.  Need to make sure I get in for dinner soon as well or for live music after 9 when it becomes 21 and over only.  Breakfast is really affordable, they do a 2x2x2 which is really cheap and will fill you up, good coffee and a mean Bloody Mary as well.  Another great reason to hang out in lovely downtown Salem."}, {"review_id": "ySifX57G2kMqOPIzbviXEQ", "user_id": "VfmaxmgsgGSZdz_yyaM36w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Inconspicuous from the outside, but inside you will find delicious foods and solid cocktails.

However, if you get their nachos or anything with their fresh grapefruit juice in it, you will have a 5 star experience. I've had nachos at 2-3 restaurants since I ate at taproot in March, and I have been pining for Taproot nachos ever since. Also every server I've had there has been cool, attentive, and helpful with their unique menu.

She is vegetarian and I'm mostly vegetarian and there were tons of great vegan/vegetarian options. We both got the mushroom Swiss veggie burger and it was awesome! Flavorful with just the right amount of everything. We got brussels sprouts on the side and I was disappointed with them...way too greasy, almost to the point of dropping as we picked them up. We also got a side of poutine and it was \"meh\"...not great, not bad. Lastly, we got cocktails. I found mine to be way too strong (the cool as a cucumber)but my sister's was fantastic. Cute setting with cool art and hipster vibes. I would return for sure."}, {"review_id": "bZV6sPz3Ut5fVKeopjY-nA", "user_id": "kmS8d6PA1CPJ_d5wgi0ZiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Had breakfast here today.

The layout is long when you walk in with a few booths and lots of tables. Plenty of seating as well. The staff is amazing and works together well. Excellent service. With a food allergy, I have to ask a lot of questions to prevent getting sick. The waitress and chef went way above and beyond to be sure I didn't eat anything that would alter my digestion. The food selections are delicious! We had the fried avacados and brussels. So good. The brussels come in a big portion so plan to share. I had the pumpkin avocado milkshake and was pleasantly surprised with the smaller than usual size and how delicious and fresh it is. For main dishes, I had the desert bowl and my partner had the beast. Both were fresh and delicious. Good quality ingredients. I highly recommend this restaurant."}, {"review_id": "XsH2p8deRUYJ0hJ1XPfzcA", "user_id": "NxxwwrnyuyIt2hvRIsFqRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Shout out to the Western Regional Semifinals of the International Championship of Collegiate A Capella! We were in Salem, Oregon to cheer on the After School Specials from the Claremont Colleges. Since we were \"A Ca-early\" for the competition, and ravenous from our drive from Portland, we went in search of big game. Fortunately, Taproot Lounge and Cafe was close by and inviting. By the way, the award for the most creative use of a multi-blade midwestern windmill doubling as a ceiling fan goes to Taproot. Check out the pictures associated with this review and you will see what I mean. Now on to the review, I need to focus! The staff was very friendly and seated us immediately. The menu was enticing and we started with poutine and the fried brussel sprouts. Both of these were very good and seemed to be urging us on to our entrees. We chose the Kalbi Tacos, the Philosopher Bowl, the Ferdinand Salad, the Spicy Bowl and the Taproot Grilled Cheese. The kalbi tacos were tasty with pickled beets, pickled carrots, pickled cabbage, pickled onions, red peppers, cilantro, and kalbi sauce. The philosopher bowl was excellent and included roasted tomatoes, black olives, feta, cucumbers, spinach, tahini, chickpeas, and tzatziki. Yum! The Ferdinand salad included avocado, spinach, arugula, brown rice, salsa, red peppers, corn, beans, chips, and chipotle ranch to which we added pork. The spicy bowl was spicy in a very good way. It was constructed with kale, scallions, avocado, pickled cabbage, sesame seeds, pickled carrots, sugar snap peas, and the house spicy sauce. Finally,  our last choice was the grilled cheese which was made with cheddar and goat cheese, tomato all served on organic sourdough. Tremendous! We left this wonderful find satisfied with an excellent dining experience. Now it is time to cheer on the After School Specials! Go team!.... Is it ok to yell \"go team!\" at an a capella competiton?"}, {"review_id": "t0fi85Cg2SzKHWxFv2Id3w", "user_id": "CHfiOaSbtcZZjnm8s211Qw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/19/2017", "text": "Exceptional vegan options when a beloved all vegan restaurant isn't around.
