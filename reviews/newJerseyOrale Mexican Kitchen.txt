Decided to walk over to Mathews instead that night but quickly picked another night on the calendar to go to Orale for dinner (a Friday at 8:30pm). When we arrived, it was PACKED and we waited ~10-15 min before getting seated. Once we sat, we ordered a guac tasting of 3 and drinks while we were still deciding on entrees. We went with OMK house blend, pork belly, and pulp guacs. These were goooood. Pork belly was probably the least favorite, although still enjoyable. The house blend was classic/can't go wrong. The pulpo sounded odd to us at first, but we absolutely loved it! The tortilla chips were absolutely addicting, perfectly crispy and not too salty. Ate our weight in chips alone.We then split two entrees - crispy halibut soft tacos (5) and the enchiladas suezas (2). The halibut was perfectly cooked, not greasy at all and flaky. Some more guac and pickled onions was served with these. The 5 mini tacos were great to split and down right adorable. Also, the tacos were served with a side of rice and beans. The enchiladas were swimming in green sauce and we loved every second of it. The chicken in the enchiladas was pulled and moist. Will definitely be back to OMK and would love to try their brunch!"}, {"review_id": "Fh5_nuhoi6nghA6EoKWySw", "user_id": "MoymjWSoZin8zU6AeIhuxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Went there on a Friday Eve..amazing atmosphere , good music and food.

If you are looking for some awesome Mexican cuisine in the area, look no further than this restaurant! The inside of the restaurant has a very cool and edgy vibe to it. Be sure to make a reservation because event with it, you might still have to wait a couple of minutes until the table you will be sitting at is cleared. Our go-to appetizer would be the flautas (portion of two) and they are on the smaller side but with a full meal, it is more than enough food. This past weekend, we did the flautas as well as the queso dip and both were great. If you run out of chips, just ask for more! For dinner, you can never go wrong with the chicken tacos!"}, {"review_id": "oVWDRaSeFTZthllxikq6KQ", "user_id": "SeWsQoYPbQuMAqfRNNS6Jg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "After visiting Departed Soles Brewery, I needed food options.  They are located right nearby, and they have a bar where you can sit easily.  They have a really hip, modern atmosphere.  I was surprised how busy they were for 3:30 pm, which is normally a quiet time between lunch and dinner.  The bartenders didn't notice me after a while, and I was never greeted.  I had to flag him down.Their specialty mixed drinks look really good, but I wasn't able to sample any of them because I already had a flight at the brewery.  Whenever I see lamb on the menu at a nice place, I like to try it.  I asked for help with the menu, but I didn't get much.  I really wonder why the bartender would tell me that my first choice to get the lamb tacos was a good one.  The lamb tacos ended up being very small.  The quality of the meat was also just leftover strips and not the prime section.  It wasn't bad, but for the sub-par quality and the $21 dollar price, I felt slightly cheated.It's better just to go to a mom & pop Mexican restaurant in a strip mall closer to home or maybe to one that is in an off-the-beaten path section of Jersey City instead."}, {"review_id": "G1nKon65mESFdaDpDDIaDQ", "user_id": "-ZhhlENaEtObyy-j13rZaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "MY NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT. This place absolutely blew my mind with its food! I think it is the best mexican place I have tried in the east coast.To start, we ordered the guacamole, which was so fresh and delicious. We also ordered the halibut tacos and they were amazing! They had a nice curry type flavor and the acidity from the onions and the creaminess from the aioli made it such a tasty experience. As for the main course, I got the vegetarian enchiladas. I could eat this for dinner everyday! It had such a unique flavor with brussel sprouts and some sort of sweet potato inside, topped with a yummy enchilada sauce and fried onions! I absolutely loved it. My boyfriend got the honey braised chicken tacos and that was also delicious and also had a slight kick to it!As there is always room for dessert, we ordered the strawberry tres leches cake. It was sooo good! One of the best I've had- so fresh and light but filled with that sweetness from the condensed milk and a nice tartness from the strawberries. I am blown away from this place and I cannot wait to try their brunch selection!"}, {"review_id": "RywmhOpyKZ1WR08fbwj0jA", "user_id": "xLcNMU6SLMMR2cOYP_BJ4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "I've decided to become a regular here. Let's start with this: The bartenders & hosts are all *beautiful*, smiling, accommodating men. There may be women who work here, but I didn't see one. It is common knowledge that food tastes better in the presence of gorgeous people, so I figured this was a tactic by the management and lowered my expectations for the food actually being any good. I am delighted to say, I was oh so wrong.I just had *the* best burger that I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. No joke. I have also come to the most logical conclusion, that they have magic'd a special sauce made of Crack Dust, Unicorn Tears and MSG. Do yourself a massive favor and order the breakfast burger at brunch.

Brunch at orale is a must try. (The cemita is sooo good) . Who doesn't like being drunk and full at 3 pm :) The food is always consistently good. Just a note I usually order fish and every-time it smells like fish. If you eat fish often like myself it shouldn't smell fishy. But again I've never had anything bad here.

Even free postcards in the bathrooms to take or you can keep the one they give you with your check. It wasn't too loud or crowded which was a refreshing difference and change of pace for similar restaurants following this style.Their entrees are really expertly done with a level of finesse belonging to an upscale restaurant.

It's a liittttle pricy. Well at least it feels like it. Especially when there are rivaling Mexican restaurants serving food at half the price across the street. *ahem* Not going to drop any names *ahem* ... However, I've stopped thinking of it that way and found myself going here quite often. I think Oralé's a great place on its own. The food is amazing and the experience is vastly different. I've had most of their tacos and each has been unique and very flavorful (my favorites being the lamb and the carnitas.)As much as I love Mexican cuisine, I do find that many dishes tend to lapse in terms of taste; dishes start tasting very similar at your typical taqueria but you don't get that at Oralé. Every dish is memorable and your cravings become very specific. Like for instance, today is Monday; and I'm craving their duck nachos. Yesterday; I was craving their Chilaquiles. Tomorrow? Maybe their queso fundido. Like I said, if you haven't yet, give their food a shot. I think it's definitely worth the hype and that's saying a lot since I was one of those people who was extremely hesitant in trying this place. In terms of atmosphere, Oralé is a great place to bring dates, groups or anyone you'd want to impress. The interior is very cool, lots of photo opps and the staff is so accommodating. I remember standing and waiting for bar seats to open during their happy hour and one of the sweetheart bartenders walked up to me and pointed out a seat that was going to open. Its gestures like those that get me coming back repeatedly. Melts my heart. Plus taco Tuesdays are also a big motivator (bring cash!)"}, {"review_id": "H6MWhV-RwbgCklrJrYFYcw", "user_id": "2kX_wN-mQBfE_X8yGyN_OA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Simply the best in the neighborhood - or any neighborhood.

We ordered two carne tacos, one carnitas tacos, one tuna tacos, one queso flameado, one yucca frita and a tres leches. Everything was cooked right on point with such an authentic flavor. Way to go chef! Margaritas were at $10 each. After ordering 15 you can see how quick our bill increased. I also ordered four glasses of wine and did request to kindly charge the glasses as a bottle instead. Hence the fact that we were customers on a roll purchasing margaritas, the waiter kindly apologized stating the manager would not do so. After requesting for the manager and still telling us no he then changed his mind and stated as for this one time courtesy he would change us for a bottle instead of four individual glasses. Truly appreciate that courtesy but going through that minor hassle was truly unnecessary. At that when I came back from the bathroom my half filled glass was gone because they had cleared off the table. Onto our waiter Zack. This gentlemen needs a standing novation! He falls under our top three best waiters ever. This waiter was beyond attentive to his tables and on target with everything. For starters he took our orders without writing them down and got it all correct. He made specials very clear. He explained and even gave us a second notice that paying with cash would be best to getting drinks half off. Zack also brought out a complimentary flan for our birthday girl along with our purchased delicious tres leche. Overall, thanks for all Zack!! He made this experience welcoming and worth going back for. Part of the star removal is the drink specials. Half off drink specials when paying with cash only is pretty ridiculous. I can see this being a complication if coming with a big party. It's a new era and technology is what revolves. Therefore, providing specials for credit card customers should be just as acceptable. Making this clear on the website would be just as ideal. Totally recommend the food, go elsewhere for drinks and bring cash."}, {"review_id": "SzHl8JrQPPASQGbrWrs20g", "user_id": "JbH3P2JJLkhflM48hao6qQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Ehh I feel like this place is kind of overrated but I would definitely go for a drink or the happy hour specials.

There really wasn't any toppings aside from the slaw (I forgot what it's called) but whatever that slaw is just made it more dry. The taco definitely could have benefited from some side of sauce or something. The guac was good, again nothing special. I think Whole Foods sells better guac to be honest.

I'm all for bottomless brunch, but not getting drunk in the middle of a Sunday is definitely a goal of mine, at least most of the time.For $6 you can choose from frozen margaritas, sangria, mimosas, and/or a bloody mary. We tried mimosas first -- strong, and made with fresh OJ. Excellent. Next up was the red sangria -- strong, not too sweet. Also excellent.It took us a long, long time to decide on food. It's hard to choose the direction -- do you go all lunch food? All brunch? Half and half? Just eat a gallon of guacamole? These are all feasible, reasonable options.We went for half and half, with biscuits. (Biscuits were amazing)The final order was huevos rancheros and fish tacos, and both plates were cleaned. I like sauces that aren't overwhelming, and even though there were two or three different ones on the huevos, none of them overpowered one another; they all worked really well together. The fish tacos were excellent (fried fyi) -- and came with a really crunchy slaw on top.The place itself is dark, with really tall ceilings, and is lit with a lot of different colored lights / things on the wall. Parking is sparse, but that's to be expected.Next time: more biscuits, another egg dish, another lunch dish, and I definitely want to try the avocado toast."}, {"review_id": "xwAJLut7ZYWH_vQKGbdVtQ", "user_id": "ZDHGnJ8PC-a1Ro6o5JNiAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "I have been here twice now.
