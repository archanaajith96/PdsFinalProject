The bread for the Schwarma is very tradition Lebanese style pita. The beef and lamb was moist and delicious. The fry sauce has its own Greek twist. Overall, the food was great. The owner is also very friendly. She brought us a plate of sliced oranges at the end of our meal for free! Definitely try this place."}, {"review_id": "LJ03N4Wug5RWFqwc2x5MOA", "user_id": "EcADXTXzLojEhSnK8QryQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/7/2017", "text": "I was hesitant to eat here because of the location. The food court at the Provo town center? But don't let the location deceive you! This food was fantastic and the service was out of this world for being a food court find. This is just 3 minutes from my office so I will be eating here frequently, especially because the price was affordable and the food filling. The menu was simple so I didn't feel overwhelmed and the gyro I ordered didn't fall apart as I ate It. They didn't skimp on meet or toppings either which is always a HUGE bonus. My husband and i both ate for under $15 and we left full! Would definitely recommend eating here."}, {"review_id": "4JZMsantu7eulnqrTQm_ew", "user_id": "JhuseLKZ15vjNxeNf7Od0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "I was pleasantly surprised when i found this place. I love gyros. And King Kebab did not disappoint. I've never had the schwarma but I look forward to coming back to try it. PRICE: It really wasn't unreasonable. All I got was a gyro and it was less than 8 bucks. And it was huge. ATMOSPHERE: It's located in a mall food court. So it's what you would expect from a food court. Tables were clean. FOOD: I got a traditional gyro. What makes this place unique is that it is set up so you can create your own gyro or schwarma wrap by choosing which ingredients you like. Kind of like subway, but with Mediterranean food. The meat was quality. They have two huge things of meat rotating on skewers that they shave slices off of right in front of you. And the lamb is soooooo tasty. They have various sauces as well. SERVICE: There was only one lady working and she was extremely friendly and helpful when I was trying to decide. Super fast service as well. I really liked this place."}, {"review_id": "ToDCbhLnk-i27t1FFQdRHA", "user_id": "1prVpumNNs_6LmHR_6opYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/17/2016", "text": "Best Middle-Eastern grub in Provo! (Out of two and a half places).King Kebab is a surprising find in the Provo Mall's food court. You unfortunately don't see many family-owned places in malls, but it makes sense when you think about it: lower overhead, a relatively predictable stream of potential customers, etc. King Kebab is certainly the best option for food here. Skip the Johnny Rockets and Panda Express and make a beeline here.The menu is simple, with few options. It's not the traditional versions of what you'll find in Beirut, but closer to New York's street food carts (you know the one). I ordered the beef-lamb shawarma sans fries (yes, they normally throw in fries California-burrito-style). The meat has been layered onto a vertical roasting spit (like what you see with al pastor), and when you order they shave the sizzling outer layer of the meat for your pita. They layer it with veggies, harissa, and garlic \"shawarma sauce\" in a warm pita. The end result is a huge Lebanese taco--big enough that I was debating between making it one or two meals. If you get double meat, it's definitely enough to split between two people.Overall, I was pleased. The meat actually ranked pretty low in my shawarma experience. While the preparation was legit, the cuts seemed quite lean and the meat overall underseasoned in comparison to what I've had in my travels. I recall enjoying the meat far at the Greek n Go gyros truck on Canyon in Provo, but that may be due to my preference for 100% lamb.The garlic sauce, though, is great. This is reminiscent of what you'll get at Halal Guys and is nearly addicting. It brought back some happy foodie memories.The pita was surprisingly good. I don't believe it's made in-house, and they warm it up in the microwave, but I was not disappointed. This, for me, is a comfort food: grub that reminds me of home. Given that measuring stick, of course it's going to be hard to compare to what I associate with happy memories, but I can say this: King Kebab sure could do a lot worse. It's a surprising gem in Provo and one I definitely expect to return to."}, {"review_id": "8Wgf2lMA6WYwLAUTjk1kvw", "user_id": "Qh8DE4TKq-Az-oBHTRw5BA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So, I've been Yelping for some time now and have a much better feel for the  impact a review can have on restaurant and the people that make it run. Enough to know, at least, when I've been unfair.King Kabob, like its neighbor Panpaya, bucks the food court stereotype. Their menu is focused on fresh veggies and lean protein. They have a solid offering for vegan, gluten free, and dairy free diners. And their dessert menu features delicacies like house made (!) chocolates, locally made Baklava, and Turkish Delight imported from Turkey. I've unfairly dinged KK for being located in the mall, but you know, I'm kind of glad they are. The friendly service and personal consideration they offer are an oasis. I shouldn't have been shocked to hear this gem is locally owned and operated. It shows.Strong recommend."}, {"review_id": "8hrOcTHhnZgy_a0XmKTVJw", "user_id": "CnsMBLXdEnIW_YtBTo_jCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Suuuuuuuuuuper good.

These kebabs are as generic as they come. There is nothing exceptionally good or bad about them. The big down side is the price to portion size ratio. Way too expensive for what you get.
