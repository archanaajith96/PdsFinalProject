Very busy on Friday night. We did not have reservations so we sat at the bar. Not too loud. Seats were very comfortable. We started with carimari and lobster Mac and cheese. Wow the Mac and cheese was phenomenonal! We every bite. Calamari was good. My beautiful wife had the fish and chips. Generous portion. Piping hot. Not as crust an exterior as she would.ahve liked. Good but not amazing. The fries that came with it were very good. They had a kinda of costing that was super crunchy. Loved them. I had the chicken pot pie. Very savory and delicious.  I finished the whole thing it was that good. They are famous for their ice cream which is all made in house. We had oatmeal cookie dough and bourbon almond brittle. Both were so flavor able and clearly in house made. Thick rich and smooth. We don't drink, but they have an extensive drink menu. Service was excellent. Service 5/5. Food 5/5. We hope they open up Phoenix at some point."}, {"review_id": "FaWakrHxdKufPOUNvtu5UA", "user_id": "Q-H4m-8R24VZSS_svjlG4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "My husband and I had a date night and chose to spend it here.It was our first time.Loved the decor and the upside lamps hanging from the ceiling.I ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese, which was delicious.

So many tempting things to choose from!We ordered the Chicken Enchiladas ave the Lobster Mac n Cheese! Oh my... hand-pulled chicken and ruin b of it! And these were made to order! Delish!

To my luck, HUB was closed for a summer remodel/expansion but a pop up was open in the Martin Drug Co. just down the street. I decided to give it a try since the menu features most of the HUB favorites. I was surprised at how eloquent the little pop was designed given the limited amount of space in comparison to the actual location. The ambiance was trendy with a few interesting pieces such as shag rugs on the walls and some fun lighting. Interestingly enough, the pop up had a full bar and was suitable for an intimate date, a family outing or a casual dining experience. The pop up menu featured a variety of items and I went with the prime fries as an appetizer and the roasted corn and avocado salad add ahi.The prime fries (recommended from the waitress) were crispy fried, thin cut fries topped with a cheese sauce, caramelized onions and prime rib. They sounded similar to animal fries from In n Out sans the thousand island dressing and with the addition of prime rib. The fries were tasty, but oh so salty. The cheese sauce was creamy and delicious and complimented the meat fairly well. The mild sweetness from the onion coupled with the prime rib were a nice duo. Definitely a shareable item and super tasty if you're looking for a crispy, salty app.The roasted corn and avocado salad was defined by the waitress as the most popular salad option on the menu. Mixed greens, roasted corn, avocado, pistachio, queso fresco and chili lime vinaigrette on the side (per request) minus the grape tomatoes and with the addition of the ahi tuna was super tasty. It was served with a toasty piece of bread on the side. In all honesty, I wish I ordered the salad without the ahi. The fish did not seem like a great addition to this, already flavorful, salad. I would definitely re-order but without the addition of a protein.I was so bummed that I did not get to experience the real HUB because I was so looking forward to the famous ice cream. Nonetheless, the dishes were tasty and the service was decent. Initially, I asked her to replace my cup because there was a stain on it and she kindly obliged and apologized. The food overall did not blow me away but the overall experience was a hit. I look forward to visiting the actual HUB on my next visit and getting a chance at the ice cream. Tip: In the meantime, The Screamery is open and they're ice cream is fantastic!"}, {"review_id": "Ce9dppOOuHCV7wpvllDpFA", "user_id": "-tizVpfi5GhDYWAGJoxTwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Sat outside with our chihuahua for dinner, the food and drinks were great, the staff were very nice even bringing water for our dog.

Jerelle our waiter said he would see what they can do... let me just say they created magic back in the kitchen! Jerelle brought out a whole new pasta with fresh tomatoes, basil, Parmesan and a slight taste of lemon. It was so amazing!

I was pleasantly surprised! Three of us stopped in for lunch on a Saturday around 1:30pm. First of all I really liked the ambience... high ceilings, exposed brick, nice decor and a cool bar. I hate the word hipster because that usually means a little pretentious but I thought it was just cool in a good way. The food was delicious. Massive portion sizes also! My group got Mac and cheese with chicken (pretty rich but SO so good), the fish and chips (coleslaw was probably the best I've ever had) and the turkey BLT which came with a choice of fries or tots. So obviously, we chose tots, and they were crisp and fresh. Wasn't in the mood for a cocktail but they had a very appetizing drink menu and great wine selection. We didn't have room for ice cream either (seriously, huge portions) but I wish we did. They had lots of unique flavors and I would love to sample a few. Bathrooms were nice and clean. Waiter was attentive and pleasant. Outdoor seating was available and looked cute.

I had never been here so I have no idea what it looked like before or if the food is better. But let me tell you, I will DEFINITELY be returning.The staff was extremely prompt and friendly. Our free meal consisted of an appetizer, 2 drinks, 2 entrees, and each get a free scoop of their ice cream.I took some really bad pictures (I'm weird about restaurant staff seeing me take pictures of their food so I was trying to be sneaky). We started with 2 beers and a bruschetta. The bruschetta was kinda weird... Didn't taste like traditional bruschetta and my boyfriend didn't like it... But it was free so it was no big deal, glad we tried it.For the entree my boyfriend got the ribeye and fries. It was delicious but there wasn't really anything special or different about it. I got the Hub Shank and OMG I start to drool just thinking about it. Here's the menu description:\"8 hour braised pork shank, green chili and caramelized onions au gratin, apple bourbon bacon jam, fried shoestring onions.'I don't go to new restaurants very often so maybe it doesn't mean much that I liked this dish but it is one of the tastiest dishes I have ever had in my entire life and I recommend it to everyone. I went to work the next day and raved about it to my coworkers. It was the most tender pork ever, the au gratin with the green chili paired so well with the puddle of apple bourbon bacon job that it was sitting on, and it was all topped with the shoestring onion rings. Who doesn't love shoe string onion rings?!For ice cream I got Strawberry Tres Leches, and it was very good but it tasted more like strawberry cheesecake than tres Leches. My boyfriend got Oreo Mint Chip and he liked it as well.Even though this was all free, it would've totalled up to almost $80. We normally don't get appetizers or beers so this would be probably come out closer to $40-$50 which I think is pretty reasonable for a date night."}, {"review_id": "zN6Iqfwo2giaMl4lGUHMVA", "user_id": "WjsZSsBbUTwkGUIkv7TpjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Excellent dining atmosphere both inside and outside (provided the weather is right).

However, they were closed for the summer and I hadn't been in close to a year. We decided to go last weekend and try out a few new things on their menu. I ordered the catfish plate and my husband ordered the chicken pot pie. Let's start with the catfish, it wasn't super fresh, it didn't smell or taste fishy but I'm pretty sure it was waiting for me before I ordered it. The cheddar grits were legit and the broccoli/carrot mix was sort of bitter. When I think of pot pies I think of a buttery, flaky crust; because let's face it, its all about the crust! The crust was definitely flaky and had a decent flavor, I was just missing the golden, brown, buttery flavor. But the inside of the pot pie was delicious. Big chunks of chicken and veggies, really tasty. And what really helped was our appetizer! How could I forget! We had the cheese curds from heaven! They are so amazing! And the service was also really good. Fast, friendly, everything you'd expect from a busy downtown restaurant. Overall, I think I'll stick with what I normally order at the Hub. The mac and cheese, prime dip, prime fries, wings or the steak."}, {"review_id": "FkxY32AZS_bHCFuEcgSwdg", "user_id": "1zj0n7gyJ0jmWfYQRhvstA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Dark inside but the best cheese fries ever!!!
