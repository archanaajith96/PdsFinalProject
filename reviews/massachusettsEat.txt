I've driven by this place many times but never noticed it. It's only a couple miles from my house which I've decided is great! I met up with some friends here who were visiting from the Midwest and happpened upon EAT and selected it as the winner, while searching for local Awesome eateries. We were all happy with what we ordered, everything looked great and was presented beautifully, from my lovely cob salad  (the grilled chicken was the highlight!) to the coffee, to the house made soups, sweet potato fries, mushroom Swiss burger(cooked medium to perfection I would add) ,to the epic mountain they call their version of a Monte Cristo sandwich!!.(I was so jealous when this arrived in front of my friend! I must try it my next visit). Once you find a parking spot in the back and poke around the all white building for the entrance you will notice it's is A bit small inside, but cozy and comfortable with tasteful decor (no grandma humor tin tray pseudo-vintage signs that tease fresh eggs and coffee for 10¢. Tacked to the walls on top wallpaper showcasing a repeating pattern of an Americana interpretation of chicken, cow, Pig. Chicken cow pig. ChickenCowPig. You know the kind. It felt younger, fresher, more hip than the typical breakfast/lunch spot. Service was great! Pretty blond waitress was great at her job and positively adorable. This place has it all, and I personally like that it seems to be hiding, I wanna be able to come again and get a seat. I know if word gets out, there will be a mile line long with hipsters, students, families, fellow seekers  of epic, satisfying and nourishing breakfast and lunch perfection a mile long. Pricing is very reasonable taking consideration the quality and care of the crafted dishes bestowed upon us. I'd be hard pressed to find something wrong here. Which is rare. If I had to, I'd say it's unfortunate they are only open till 2pm. I will definitely recommend this place as well as come back."}, {"review_id": "GRFimFDbQRpWPwVGof6Jig", "user_id": "waPBiPCZrhAK5z_tdkqNrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Went to this little gem to celebrate getting a new job. I've never heard of this place but my coworker suggested it for breakfast. It had great yelp reviews so I was all in. They could use bigger or more prominent signage because I could have easily drove past it if it weren't for my coworkers walking in. It's a very small building with about 6 tables inside and full view of the kitchen. Two of us tired the special of avocado toast, eggs and bacon and were highly satisfied. The other two had omelets. I was surprised how full I was after. We also tried their Jamaican coffee. The food.. the prices... the service were all great! I look forward to stopping by here again as they had several good options on the menu."}, {"review_id": "llNFXXcexSAY-48oaoJaUA", "user_id": "LDldOeQ8Wns7xQetChsm5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Went to \"Eat\" with Nia... everything was so good and fresh!!!

It's a small diner, however, it is huge when it comes to food quality and service. Our waitress was very professional and friendly and always made sure that we had enough hot coffee.

There are maybe enough seats inside for 20 people, no more. We entered and were quickly greeted, and they helped us pull some tables together for a group of six. The inside was clean, and low frills. We placed our drink orders and were told they were \"only serving lunch\" at this time. I found that a little odd, given that it is well advertised as a brunch place, but nonetheless we all ordered some sandwiches. The prices are VERY reasonable for everything on the menu.The kid's burger was rather large for a kid's meal, but no complaints with that I suppose. The Rachel was solid, with freshly toasted bread and delicious roasted turkey. Coleslaw was decent, a little on the bland side. The other sandwiches were all enjoy by all in our party. They have sweet potato fries, which were delicious. I look forward to coming back sometime and trying their \"chicken and waffles\" and breakfast items. The table next to us ordered it and it looked incredible. Overall a good experience, a little bit of a hidden gem. The prices make it a great find in Springfield!"}, {"review_id": "k9FLHPWBpUlN56dAaqunJg", "user_id": "EZ3GZEehpyY4_b1ZvGTgww", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "Was in the area and looked this place up on Yelp. The food was delicious, nothing really special, just a local place where you can count on the food being great. The green tea is amazing and I liked that it was topped with mint. You don't see that often. I ordered the spicy cheeseburger and it was cooked just right and the fresh cut fries made for a nice compliment. My friend ordered the buffalo wrap, she asked that they make it with jack cheese instead of buffalo (weirdo I know) and they said they went able to accommodate with annoyed her. Overall if you're in the area and need a place that's a solid choice for lunch I highly recommend you come here!"}, {"review_id": "QDxE2vfjEoBS7f4igi5qAg", "user_id": "akgHS3a9NFQ6DFEeAA891w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "I define a 5 based on the quality of the food, the staff and the overall experience. We stopped in after reading several Yelp reviews.   From the outside the place seems very small and you might question stopping. DON'T let external appearance keep you away. This is hands down one of the best sandwich places I have been to. We had the turkey special, the Ruben and the buffalo chicken. Each sandwich was fresh, well put together, flavorful and hearty. Both the French fries and tater tots were delicious and what I might consider an add on or cole slaw was actually really good.

Their waffles is a churro batter waffle. The cinnamon-y, sweet flavor pairs well with the savory fried chicken. And the syrup hits the spot. It was everything that I asked for and more.

People were coming in to pick up take out orders frequently, too, so seems like a very popular place and we just lucked out on the timing. Food was very good, fresh. I had the Reuben omelet, with great shredded corned beef. My son had scrambled eggs and bacon, husband had eggs kielbasa and the loaded home fries. Broccoli and tomatoes in the home fries were very fresh and were a nice take on the traditional boring home fries. Reasonable prices, pretty quick service.
