The staff is incredibly friendly and very accommodating.  They have a lot of bagels and delicious cream cheese to pick from.  They also have the option for sandwiches and great breakfast items.  There is ALTERRA coffee! Also, a bunch of different options for drinks and smoothies.  I really love all their selections.They have wifi and also plenty of seating.  The parking is also great because it is shared with a couple other places and a grocery store.  I highly suggest this place if you are looking for a relaxed atmosphere, to study, talk, whatever! It's great and DELICIOUS!"}, {"review_id": "PaVgW2NlmN77u61iT5WZOg", "user_id": "zmr4gUzWiaPeEhIfeKXOvA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/23/2017", "text": "I've known about this place for a while and had their bagels when someone brings them to work for an early meeting.  One morning, I was on the road for a quick breakfast and noticed I was driving past it.  I slammed my brakes and took the time to check it out.  I was surprised how many people were there having conversations and enjoying a cup of coffee.  It has that coffee house feel to it, but probably not a place to get work done...more of a meet up place.  Obviously this place has tons of bagels.  They have a couple of options for breakfast.  I got the  bagel breakfast sandwich.  It's pretty simple as you choose your bagel, meat (bacon, sausage, or ham) and cheese (four different kinds), and an egg patty.  The difference is that you're getting a big bagel with several thin slices of ham, and the cheese....oh the cheese!  As soon I split the sandwich in half, the cheese started oozing out.  It was full of melty deliciousness.  I scarfed it down and was ready for another.  There are plenty of coffee drinks and teas to choose from.  Being a tea drinker, I really liked that they use loose teas.  They have a really nice Earl Grey tea and it was very reasonable price...a little over $1.50.  Lots of places you're paying over $2.  I totally get why this spot has such positive Yelp reviews.  A new quick breakfast spot for me!"}, {"review_id": "yZb3UQ8w7LJLGPbDqWA2Yw", "user_id": "_c1dx5zPEiHFxnW6nVeATQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/10/2017", "text": "Yesterday I stopped in and picked up my first and best chocolate chip scone.... was like eating the perfect chocolate chip cookie. What would have made it even better? A cup of coffee!! I missed my chance to sip a Collectivo coffee (formerly Altera) and enjoy this treat. I get it, not everyone gets the tasty dry muffin cousin and that's ok. But if by chance you get to try do so. I'm usually a strict blueberry or raspberry scone girl so when I tell you this was good... you can trust me. I wish I had taken pictures but all the evidence is happily gone. The also have a menu of bagel sandwiches for which the lox will always be my choice. A friend of mine says the bagels here are best in town, I I'll trust her on that. Soups, muffins, gluten free bakery, smoothies and deli salads round out their menu."}, {"review_id": "GnS5Si9AAUOsk92VeJWfIQ", "user_id": "WV5XKbgVHJXEgw7f-b6PVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2017", "text": "I am ashamed to say I did not know this place existed. My husband recommended we stop in for a quick lunch and drink yesterday. We shared the pumpernickel bagel with lox cream cheese. WOW, this is the best bagel combo I have had for years if not forever. The chives in the cream cheese worked well with the hardy bread of the pumpernickel. The girl taking our order had recommended it and she was right it was perfection. I also ordered a chai latte with almond milk. It was luscious and creamy. I like the subtle heat of their variety of chai they use. I will be back next time I crave a bagel."}, {"review_id": "noeFbLJoDQ3J84OTs14JZQ", "user_id": "7Q5ziQYXp--uv2ztJJkmBw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Stopped in this afternoon after work as a first time customer. I was very excited to hopefully find a place that I could frequently stop at as the location is convenient for me. The girl who took my order wanted nothing to do with me. I did have a few questions as it was my first time there (there was no one behind me in line and it wasn't that busy so she had plenty of time) she probably rolled her eyes at me about 6 times in the minute I was standing there placing my order. She was very short with her answers and I could barely understand her. At one point she even sighed at me. Every single table in the place was filled with crumbs when I went to sit down. Very good sandwich-obviously just don't have the right people giving this place a good impression!!! I don't even think I would give it a second chance"}, {"review_id": "bXRBDIhqQlgmRvgYQzUeeQ", "user_id": "8BUCAQEUXNOX7kP6lcUpBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2017", "text": "Love this place.  Casual and reasonably priced.  You have not lived until you have had one of their cinnamon rols, frosted and warmed in microwave."}, {"review_id": "v7nlNhBY_AGc5i-fNHedLw", "user_id": "QcTi1zVIsOdmb5_KFqilew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/18/2016", "text": "My coworker ate here every single day so I decided I finally needed to try it.

My favorite is Turkey Club on a veggie wrap- very good!! Huge variety of bagel flavors daily as well as cream cheeses. Bagels are fantastic. They also sell 'yesterday's' bagels bagged up to go. Various homemade bars, cookies, muffins, desserts. They have bagged chips- Doritos, Sun Chips, Ms Vickie's potato chips, etc. I've always been happy with their customer service- they are friendly, smiling & greeting you nicely.

The breakfasts are fresh with large portions. Every bagel I have had was so soft and flavorful.  The only downfall is during a busy time, with the way their line works, if all you desire is coffee or a pastry it may take quite some time for someone to get to you and ring you up.

This place stands apart as the best place on the metro Green Bay area to get a bagel. With a wide variety of flavors, a true coffee house operation of beverages and tasty cream cheese options, you'll find something you love. I prefer savory over sweet and love the spinach parmesan bagel with cucumber dill cream cheese. This place is not far off of 172, well worth the drive if you frequent that highway."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/lox-stock-and-bagel-green-bay?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
