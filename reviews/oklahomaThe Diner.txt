The Diner and Norman go together like peas and carrots. There's the historical Downtown Main Street aspect, followed by the fame of being featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, not to mention delicious greasy spoon classic southern diner food. I love to sit at the countertop to watch the kitchen magic unfold.The biscuits are fresh and warm (sometimes they run out), the bacon is always crispy but not overdone, every omelette is made to order, and fruit pancakes (with the fruit actually inside the batter) are always on the menu. The home fries are the best I've ever had; no where else compares, imo.Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "gjcNz6BDedmgV1uOaanS-Q", "user_id": "FC_AhJtrJJuwPfw4SEI8Lg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "This place is fantastic! The food is great and the atmosphere brings back memories of childhood. A simple but great meal away from the franchises that have taken over the world. Waitresses are friendly, cooks are fun to watch as the grill is right in front of the counter, and the food has been great every time we go here. I have only had breakfast but hope to sometime be in area around lunch to give that a try. I live two hours away but always come by here when I am in town. Definitely recommend!Omelettes with green chiles are great, pancakes are great, French toast is great, home style potatoes are great."}, {"review_id": "TOHr3rPDnBAgXjPe2c_yZQ", "user_id": "ts3PXAL80WgUNlsVGOkR4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "This could be a new regular stop for us. We sat at the bar right in front of the grill and got to chat with all of the staff. There couldn't be friendlier, more down to earth people than the people who work here! They make you feel right at home. Now on to the food. I ordered the egg quesadilla and my boyfriend had to order what Guy Fieri ordered when he came here which is the burrito. Mine was average but my boyfriend's burrito was amazing. If I ordered the same thing again I'd maybe add pinto beans to it or something for some additional flavor. Also, come hungry because the portions are monstrous!I highly recommend the diner and I'm looking forward to trying the whole menu in the future!"}, {"review_id": "46n8IJIvb8sB41Hujj-hTg", "user_id": "m-IZMSO_Y-tG9PLJE18Plg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "We walked in to find a long hallway type Space with booths on the left hand side and counter seating overlooking the flattop. There were a couple parties ahead of us but it was maybe 5-8mins before a booth was cleared and we were able to sit. Wouldn't recommend coming here with a party larger than 4 due to potential wait time and even then you'll be touching elbows in the booth.It was time for Sunday brunch and I was craving a burger, go figure. So I ordered the cheese burger with bacon, no onions please! Fries which was an upcharge to a side of ridged potato chips and  I asked for mayo and mustard on the side. When our food arrived my server forgot my on the side condiments but nbd. The amount of bacon added to the burger was very satisfactory. Bun was soft, burger was cooked nicely, just done very well. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had but it suffices. $9-10 plus a $1something upcharge for the fries.This place has a lot of history but I didn't really get the hype. As customers walked in, the cold air hits you like a freight train if you're 'lucky' to sit in one of the first two booths. Even though I'm giving them 3 stars, I'm looking forward to trying them again and ordering off of the breakfast menu since most of the 4-5 star reviews are talking about breakfast."}, {"review_id": "oMMntA2S7Jhp0h2cO6dwuQ", "user_id": "vVXT9s4BLje0O9s7JdUYyQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "Not impressed seeing how it was on DD&D maybe I need to try something else, the huevo rancheros wasn't that great and my eggs weren't even cooked correctly."}, {"review_id": "sVYdaHm83SvqbyfM9ke0_Q", "user_id": "d53IhBTHTc0gxqd_pnmrzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "I got a club sandwich that was amazing!

We had a meeting on campus so we wanted a diner close to campus. I love Norman's Main Street! The Diner is smack in the middle of Main Street and I was happy to see so many locally owned businesses on Main Street. We were seated immediately at the counter. I'm big on NOT smelling like food after leaving a restaurant and guess what? I did not smell like food. They really have good ventilation. Okay, so that's a plus considering we literally sat right in front of the grill. We shared a frito chili pie and grilled cheese. The frito chili pie was pretty good. You really can't go wrong here considering it's fritos, homemade chili, and shredded cheese. I'll have to try the chili by itself next time because it was delicious. The grilled cheese was a bit \"boring\". Some butter on the bread would have been nice. Overall, I had a pleasant experience at The Diner and will come back when I am in the area. They only serve breakfast and lunch and close at 2pm so hurry in!"}, {"review_id": "VtjToRfmWYCE9VVkKaSDmQ", "user_id": "d_u-EAR0ujLMt_W0z7eXpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Good food and service!

This place is indeed a diner, style to match. It's a one aisle pathway with booths on one side, bar stools on the other. Not ideal for big parties but perfect if you have 4 or less. It's in downtown Norman, so you can enjoy the little stores and scenery while you wait. On the weekend it's usually packed, so be prepared. They have a grill behind the bar which is nice to see the fry cooks doing their thing. The menu has traditional breakfast like Chicken fried steak and eggs to things a little more unique like brisket & tamales. Service is good and fast. The food never disappoints. The CFS comes out nice and crispy & their biscuits are homemade!"}, {"review_id": "gkwibJuuyY6eQADSP8tl5w", "user_id": "ddMxIPkJhzoTqu4jVVRBgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "My first visit was today, and it was DELICIOUS!!

It's situated in a narrow store front along downtown Main Street. Take the first parking spot you see. Inside the restaurant, you will find four person booths lining one side of the restaurant while a counter & barstools line the opposite side facing the cooking station, grill & griddle.  The cooks stay busy constantly cooking hash browns,  potatoes & pancakes. Lots of egg dishes on the menu small by with burgers & sandwiches at lunch. We had the Egaritto with sausage & the Mexi Scram with sausage. The hash browns & fried potatoes that came with the meals were good. Staff was friendly & efficient. The turnover seemed faster than most diners. We never felt rushed but I think everyone just knows to eat & get moving so someone else can get seated & dine. We will be back but probably not on an OU game weekend. It would be a safe bet that there would be a substantial waiting line for this diner."}, {"review_id": "J7acBVjUW236oMZOI9SprQ", "user_id": "5UAj092bUxjZ8MUYWFyVvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Glad we waited. 4.5 star review well earned.

I opened my yelp  app to look for a place in Norman. First listing was \"The Diner\". Reviews are good and consistent. We walked in and had to wait for a seat. Very small hole in the wall with great old fashioned bar seating across from the open cook's line. Over heard two servers arguing over glasses of water. Typical server interaction and humorous.  Between the 3 of us we had eggs,sausage links, pancakes, blueberry pancakes,hash browns, and bacon. Everthing was really good and reasonably priced. I know it can be hard to mess up eggs and pancakes, but it happens. Basic good food. The cakes are really good and tasted differently over other pancakes. You taste the quality in the sausage. I believe many people have forgotten what food that is not chemically engineered tastes like. More restaurants need to embrace this concept. Just some friendly advice, heat the bacon up before serving. Be back when I am in town to visit my \"Sooner\"."}, {"review_id": "MkuWFdIlSdRvy1sGJ5h89g", "user_id": "LciCL8IzBs5kM4eWkjyJkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "I can't fully vouch for this place because all I've had so far are the pancakes, but oh my god. They were heavenly. I got one blueberry and one chocolate chip pancake and I liked the chocolate chip wayyyy better. They were huge, fluffy, and perfectly cooked. My friend got eggs, bacon, and biscuits and gravy and I'm not sure if there was anything special about it but next time, if I can convince myself to not get pancakes again (which I know I won't be able to do), I am definitely getting an omelette or one of their specialty items because everybody's orders around us looked amazing.
