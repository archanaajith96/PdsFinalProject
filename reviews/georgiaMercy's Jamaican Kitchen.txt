Now, here in the South although amazing food as well, I was yearning for something similar to Spanish cuisine aka PRican food not easy to find but I came across to Mercy Jamaica not the same but one island to next jeezus food is amazing. Visited twice in one day oxtails for lunch with , rice & peas, cabbage and plantains. Dinner yummy jerk pork same side"}, {"review_id": "9_Sv1_MdGFX6ihIKuFe5Ww", "user_id": "oV9sZx0mN3RRGZ0TtRqchg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "The food was perfectly cooked, I got the curry chicken.

We each got the curry chicken because they were out of Jamaican jerk chicken. The chicken was juicy and fell off the bone. Their Mac and cheese was delicious and reminded me of my grandmas. I got the fried plantains which added a nice sweetness to the dish, and they went really well with the rice. I'm not usually a fan of cabbage, but I tried some of my boyfriends and it was good enough that I could have eaten the whole thing! The pineapple lemonade was the perfect thing to wash all this tasty food down with! I can't wait to go back and try the jerk chicken!"}, {"review_id": "1ATGdYF4pE39lfjweGX27A", "user_id": "nDFKOfpyjxGPd2AY8zTJGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "I stop here every time I am in Columbus.

My favorite is the jerk chicken but today I tried the curry chicken and it was very good too. Comes with rice/beans and 2 sides. I usually get the mac n cheese and the cabbage. Service is great and even though they are often busy, I never have to wait long for my food. The curry chicken was a little too salty for my taste but otherwise delicious!"}, {"review_id": "B1kTDpG_vAfVAj_zE9hL8A", "user_id": "naaX-b1y8644EyM94ZmSmQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/4/2017", "text": "You know it's good place when everyone is willing to wait patiently in line.

However I have found to be inconsistencies with the spice of their jerk chicken. Some days it's kicking with spice and other days not so much. And I wouldn't bother buying their patties.
