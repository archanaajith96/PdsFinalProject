There's neat stuff but it's a mix of a cool pub style bar, a diner, and a smokehouse style place. The music was really random too. Drinks are served in a mason jar which is interesting and doesn't really say pub to me. The food was ok but also very random. Staff was more interested in talking to each other than being staff. It's kind of like a hipster had to many ideas and tried to do them all at once. Funny sign on the way in though. And the food that we ordered was ok."}, {"review_id": "1-lv2bCaiaB9JXMrPH8DDA", "user_id": "pg2soiiAWSvenWac41oG8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "Staying over in Lincoln at the Embassy Suites.  It was about 7:30pm dec. 23rd and it was cold! But we walked fast to this place and it took about 7 minutes. It's a nice cozy bar. The place was about half full. Our server was great. Super friendly and gave his recommendations which were spot on. The onion rings are fantastic. The southwest Cobb salad was very good. I added blackened chicken. However, I did ask if they Grill it and if it has char because I am not a fan of that. He said they do and it does have some char.  I asked if they could cook it on the flattop and he went and asked the cooks.  Since it wasn't to busy, they were happy to do it. My hubby got the sandwich with turkey,  capacola(sp?),  ghirardini peppers, garlic aioli, etc...but I can remember the name. He got nachos and they were SO good!  My 17 year old got a few tacos, carnitas, and the chorizos day he thought they were really good and ate 4!  They seemed pretty hardy and filled well. The beer was an oatmeal stout and it was good, maybe it was Tillman? I would definitely recommend this place. And if we are ever through this way again, we would definitely come back."}, {"review_id": "rFh76vexycpjXIMWH2lgsw", "user_id": "xl5OZyvhJ9A2bi5tOAKdsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "I visited here for an appetizer and beer before a show down on O street.  The facilities were great.  They bill it as a Contemporary American pub.  I like that concept.  Great woodwork and historic building so it has a pub feel.  The food we had was good.  They were a little limited in beer selection compared to a lot of places.  Still had a few taps, though.  Service was ok, not stellar.  Overall, I would come back."}, {"review_id": "jpYfDzc-ZtvxMU3FtSHGuA", "user_id": "eDFrmALBc-HcJi3xXIV6RQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Located in the Haymarket in downtown Lincoln, this is a classic college town spot for burgers and more. Both times I've been there have both been good. They have an unusual combination of burgers and toppings, some bizarre and some classic and simple. For instance, one burger (forgot the name) is served with a giant cinnamon roll as the bun! See...I told you about the weird!

First off our server was great. So mad I didn't get his name. He made suggestions, puts the kids food in first, and let us know some tips on how to have our order made. Ordered the kids chicken mitt, very well made, its huge, so our two toddlers split and we took some home. My husband enjoyed the philly with house queso (servers suggestion) and I had the Italian chopped salad. All great choices."}, {"review_id": "GgpurLDAxZE-bApgTf5OQw", "user_id": "962lXY1cT9VyfaaEtq3QCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "A group of us stopped in on a busy Saturday night and were lucky to get a table without having to wait.The server was super attentive and got everything right on our order.The food was great and came out hot AND fast.

Maybe I'm victim of a Sunday night hangover? I dunno. Stopped in around 8:30pm on a Sunday. The bar was full with baseball fans and a smattering of patrons seated in booths and tables. Host was nice and gave me choice of seating with good humor. Anyhoo, the food was above average and proper credit to the kitchen. Inventive menu with many creative offerings. I got the cowabunga burger with chips and queso. Overall very tasty though the beef smelled strong. The burger tasted good but was on the salty side. Not a deal breaker. Nice thick tortilla chips, good queso, and I loved the fresh cut jalapeños. Food alone, I could eek out four stars here.The negatives, the beer menu is scribbled on little chalkboards at the table, just the brand name, so I don't know what style each one is and have to ask. After that ordeal, no IPA is on tap? What bar/pub doesn't offer an IPA? LeadBelly. So I order a kolsch, which is normally a cold and crisp beer. What I got was a dripping glass of flat warm nothingness that I didn't finish. There was a moment when Whitney Houston song was on the speakers, baseball on the TVs, I've got this eclectic menu and stale beer on the table, and I'm too far into this bad decision to leave. Funky foodies, you'll love LeadBelly. Craft beer enthusiasts, look elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "lB1yzi7jx8JxsmFOOtmmlw", "user_id": "I9PpxV1JrGATW-u3gew3Ew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "LeadBelly has great burgers, which are highly customizable. Beyond that, there are plenty of options for specials, sandwiches, salads, and other sides. Heck, throw in a poke bowl for good measure. Why not? It all works here.LeadBelly's located in an historic Haymarket building, giving it an old school tavern charm, much in contrast to their Omaha location which is in a relatively new bay/building in the Midtown Crossing area. In Lincoln, the Haymarket patios can't be beat, and LeadBelly's is no exception.We came after watching the total solar eclipse on 8/21/17. Lincoln was jam-packed with people from all over the place. Plus it was the first day of classes for nearby UN-L. What I'm saying is that there were a few hiccups with service, but that had to be forgiven due to the astrological and student body circumstances. Our server was nice enough to comp our drinks, which I appreciated because I thought it wasn't really necessary. Thank you!Food -- I ordered the cowabunga burger. Single patty with shrimp (yes, shrimp), blue cheese sauce and cilantro. Shrimp on a burger just worked. Burger cooked medium and was delicious. Opted for a house side salad with my meal. Was too full from the burger to finish it. A visit here reminds me I need to hit up their Omaha location a bit more often!"}, {"review_id": "y0BlaVfOo-VJgAiRuJYwsA", "user_id": "aDeaGs9UHAlcMQ-uVPD11g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Lunch time was pretty busy,  Good foods, service and atmosphere with friends and family."}, {"review_id": "Xe1eH748H18oDkxKD7w7Vg", "user_id": "wRB4ydleVCuCHDS8kIIkNg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "Yelp told me I should stop here on my visit to Lincoln and I'm so glad I did. This place is located right in the middle of a shopping district and was a perfect place to stop for out of town visitors. I absolutely LOVED the menu and being able to choose between burger, grilled chicken breast or other vegetarian options for my sandwich. Everything was delicious and flavorful. Ingredients were fresh and both our burger and chicken were cooked to perfection. They had an excellent selection of beers on tap and mixed drinks to pair with their amazing food. I would definitely recommend this place over some of the other places that we passed in the area. I would most certainly go back if ever in Lincoln again."}, {"review_id": "S2_6DQkdURCxn4FboqjkJg", "user_id": "0nsg3OuHyYzRpVwZjV--Vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "On a road trip and we found this place.  Biggest problem was deciding what to get.  Everything looks great!

The diversity from each item was wonderful! They have plenty of unique food for everyone that wants to be adventurous. I opted for the simple fish and chips today which were fried perfectly. The fries and side ceased were great as well. Others at my table had Bangers and Mash, California Dreaming, and Raspberry Beret! No complaints from any. They loved everything and would definitely come back for more! The drinks were amazing as well. We had an old fashion (which was blended perfectly), Moscow Mule, and Butter Beer. Their drinks are always unique and very tasteful. Would recommend always trying a new drink whenever you visit. Only complaint was that the service was a bit slow but we know things happen sometimes so nothing to worry about!

All drinks are served in mason jars. Tacos on the menu? This tacossuer had to try them. The asada was a great cut of steak minus the seasoning on two corn tortilla. Makes for a great starter taco for someone just getting their feet wet. The chorizo was seasoned with green pepper salsa and refried beans with a little to much salt for my liking but some quac and crema fixed that up. Tacossuer review: 3 out of 5 tortilla shells. I'll be back to try the shrimp tacos"}, {"review_id": "SLvcdG5pzM4oHZnQ8bD2FQ", "user_id": "hMh1kx69INFk7bEj9D-JAQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/14/2017", "text": "Fine establishment. I did not have the hamburgers which they are known for. Went with the mac and cheese. Liked how they were open to additions or subs for no charge (like veggies). Thought the food was fine for a night where I just needed some food and nothing fancy. Mac and cheese was not your typical, since it had white cheddar. I added broccoli which I enjoyed. Food could have been a bit hotter coming out of the kitchen. I always appreciate a hot dish especially with food such as pasta. Beer selection was decent. Had about 8-10 beers on tap. Some local beers too. I sat at the bar and had good service. Appreciate how the menu is set up. They mark vegetarian options with a \"V\" and they have a gluten free section in the back. All their burgers allow you to choose your protein also including chicken, veggie patty, or portobello. And I went on Meatless Monday so they had a veggie special which was pretty cool. Looks like they have a more seats in the back, but on empty nights they close the door and just have the bar area open where you can seat yourself. Also have an outdoor area patio when it's warm out."}, {"review_id": "d4k09rfeVJvKMGBqARyVRw", "user_id": "CaPNZTVY45peLsRLbMe7Ag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Very good, with a unique mixture of foods.

Wonderful location but very busy during home football games & events @ the Pinnacle Bank arena. Parking is always challenging downtown. Worth waiting & location is really great for everything downtown."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/leadbelly-lincoln?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
