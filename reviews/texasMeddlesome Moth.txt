But, of course, how could it not be? It is a Shannon Wynne venture.  He's a genius.I ordered one of the lunch specials, the Fruitti di Mar Risotto. Risotto with shrimp, crab, and mussels.  The seafood flavors were well balanced with nice portions of shrimp and mussels.  The shrimp were overcooked so I suspect they were not sautéed or cooked in preparation for this individual serving, but they were tasty.  I thought the risotto was not as smooth as a risotto should be but it was quite tasty overall and I was very pleased with my choice.  My wife ordered a cup of the tomato basil soup and the P. C. Cobb salad. The soup was lovely, but the salad was a significant disappointment.  Lettuce in abundance, but the goodies were sparse.  One hard boiled egg halved, one quarter of a small avocado, a couple tomato wedges, a sprinkling of crumbled blue cheese and one small square of thinly sliced prosciutto the consistency of jerky.  There was a fairly generous portion of shredded baked chicken, but it was remarkably flavorless.  The dressing was apparently oil and vinegar and did not compliment the salad.  This is a dish in need of some major adjustments we think. We will most definitely return and hopefully soon.  I'm looking forward to trying their NOLA style BBQ shrimp, and a bunch of other dishes, particularly on the dinner menu.So nice to have valet parking!"}, {"review_id": "UHsM3p7fbQ2M0TugoKC4xA", "user_id": "yesQ8YQi6ZZy7qnUY1FeaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I don't often give out 5 stars but this place hit the spot with me tonight. Awesome beer selection, on tap and in bottles, and great food. And service that hit the right balance between being helpful and not hovering. It's a small plate restaurant that is meant for sharing so we had several really good choices - the ribs and brocolinni were at the top of the list for me. Only downside is that it is a little more $$ than I planned to spend but the splurge was worth it. I highly recommend this place when you are in the Dallas area."}, {"review_id": "yFSyChmZtZsyvj1Xep-ZSw", "user_id": "kzyBSX5noW--Ci-LazGhEg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "I've had Meddlesome Moth bookmarked since I first moved to Texas. Everything about this place intrigued me from the moment I heard the name. Although I really wanted to try them for dinner , I couldn't help but go there for Brunch with my Bae after he insisted on taking me out for a belated Valentine's Celebration.Not even the gloomy, rainy weather could dampen my spirits as we headed out late Sunday morning to the Design District in Dallas. Parking is a pain, especially on the weekend, but we found parking not far down the street and made the brisk walk back to the restaurant. Valet is available for those who would rather not waste the time looking.The ambiance of this place is so awesome! Cool and swanky, with splashes of quirky sophistication (that's a thing, I swear) I was in love the minute I walked in. The long, narrow stained glass panels, situated at an angle, are incredible with soft sunlight filtering through them, and I love the dimly lit, dark wood paneled bar and dining area. Wait for a table was 45 mins, but the bar was self seating and served full menu, so Jon G. and I, of course, head over there. We waited at the counter opposite the bar until two seats opened up, about 5 mins, then swooped on two prime seats. There are hooks all over for your purse or jacket, so fear not ladies!First order of business, Mimosas. We order a carafe as well as an order of morning buns \"for the table\". After some more back and forth on my part (because I swear, I am the world's most indecisive person sometimes) we finally decide to order. I get the Eggs Creole Benedict which featured a split biscuit, fried green tomatoes, crawfish étouffée, poached eggs and a cayenne hollandaise. Jon G. opts for the Pork Cheek Hash: Braised pork cheek, potatoes, peppers, charred onion, parsley and fried eggs. Morning Buns were out first, and they were in-freaking-credible! They came in an order of 4, served hot in a mini-cast iron pan, drizzled with a Texas field honey glaze. I knew I was in trouble after the first bite. Truly, sinfully delicious. The buns themselves were awesome, perfectly cooked and oh so tasty. The glaze was perfect on top and the whole dish had a subtle spiced flavor. Our food was up next.  Everything looked delicious but we did have a few issues between our two plates.I was happy with every aspect about my Benedict's except for the fact that the poached eggs were poached too long! No jiggle, no runny yolk. Thankfully it wasn't completed hard-boiled, there was a bit of creaminess in the center, but I will say that I was very disappointed. That's legit, my favorite part, and I felt just a litttttttle bit cheated, just because they looked so perfect. Everything else was good though, the étouffée was nicely seasoned and did not skimp on the crawfish, the split biscuit was buttery and dense, the fried green tomatoes lent the perfect acidic bite, and the cayenne hollandaise featured a nice, subtle spice. Now, as for Jon G.'s Pork Cheek Hash.... terribly under-salted. I took a bite and could tell that this dish had been lovingly cultivated, but without the salt to help accentuate the flavors, everything came across as muted, bland. Of course we requested a salt shaker, but salt added after a dish is finished gives it more of a salty bite as opposed to bringing out the flavors of the ingredients. Another let down was the amount of inedible plant matter in our dishes. The peppers in Jon's dish all had their stems attached, and although it does look more aesthetically pleasing, it's a bit inconvenient since he found himself having to pick out stems from his mouth and his plate. I also discovered a bay leaf in my étouffée, which again, is inedible and is normally removed before serving. Yes, this of course was a very minor inconvenience, but I expected a bit more attention to detail from a place with this much hype! In the end, we did still enjoy our visit and are open to giving Meddlesome Moth another shot, for dinner and even for brunch again. I'm hoping that our next experience will be better, so I can bump that Star rating up to 4 or 5. Until next time, Meddlesome Moth! P.s. Don't forget to grab a Gin-Gin (a chewy, ginger candy) from the bowl up front at the Hostess stand. They are one of my most favorite candies, I really wish every place had these instead of mints! Nice touch!"}, {"review_id": "BfXVPpsvo2_IZsMbPExC5A", "user_id": "mXb3iNTjFF4EmxKL-W1awA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Very trendy spot with a great atmosphere and very good food!

As for dessert, the peanut ice cream pie was good.Lives up to the reputation! They have taken some basic foods and completely changed the experience with them.

I do recommend y'all to call ahead to make dinner reservations if you're trying to dine during the weekend. The wait can be pretty long but it's worth it in the end. My absolute favorite things to order would be the Thai mussels and the bone marrow tapas. I promise that you will not regret ordering them!! The beef bone marrow is pretty rich and once combined onto the bread.... AMAZING . I'm also very obsessed with the Thai Mussels served at Meddlesome. The Thai Prince Edward Island Mussels consists of a coconut milk, red curry, and Thai aromatic flavored broth which I LOVE dipping my bread in. I've also tried the \"New Orleans BBQ shrimp\" and not a big fan of it. I found it a little too sour/sweet and think the dish should just stay in New Orleans lol. Overall, I strongly recommend everyone to try this restaurant and you will definitely see me back here for the Mussels"}, {"review_id": "N5FJP61L2BTJxN-egvY6iQ", "user_id": "Xp2TrC38rk2fnZdFqgSfBQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "My daughter and I enjoyed the Moth this evening for a short dinner.   I chose the Roasted Chicken with broccoli, on a bed of sautéed cauliflower.  A straight forward dish, but nicely prepared and seasoned.  She opted for a starter \"stick\" dish, choosing the Tandorri Beef skewers over kimchi.

This is a unique take on tapas with upscale American cuisine. I think I have tried almost everything on the menu. Everything is delicious. Pig n fig, bone marrow and the mussels are my favorite. The beer menu is probably the best in Dallas. The tap beers they carry vary and some are so rare or seasonal I've been unable to find elsewhere. I've seen beers with up to 18% ABV at times. The only dish I didn't like was the rabbit pot pie because the gravy wasn watery, I was expecting rich and thick. I reccomend a thicker roux and/or adding some cream cheese to the gravy to male it thick and rich.

I just knew as we were going somewhere close by (to the Hilton Anatole).From start to finish, this place exceeded my expectations. Atmosphere - We pulled into the parking lot and there was complementary valet parking for this restaurant. The sign was charming and the doors were pretty. There were climbing vines on the exterior of the building and surrounding the doorway which was really cool. Across the street there were trees wrapped in tiny lights. The restaurant is located in the \"design district\" which probably explains the cool vibe. Upon entering, the lighting was moody and you can see into an open kitchen. There was a slanted roof in the back that had three stained glass windows. The one I remember was the Elvis one that said \"the king\". Super awesome. I was told that all three were purchased from Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas when they were doing their own renovations.Service - Table for twelve, our server was Joel. I wish we had gotten the private section so I could talk to everyone at the table more. We had one long table, so I could only really talk to those directly near me. Not his fault. The hostess sat us at the wrong table a lot first, but they quickly fixed this. Joel was great, brought water and drinks for everyone really quickly. He was informative and passionate about his job. Drink: I got the Bell's amber ale (16 oz). It was delicious. Really smooth drink. They had an extensive list of alcohol, but I limited myself to the one since I was with coworkers I had just met. Food: Sharing plates, my fave style of eating. Mussels - This was my favouriteeeee dish of the night. I don't rmb the name, but we got the dish with the white wine base. It comes with bread to sop the delicious liquid. If I were alone, I would have picked up the bowl to drink the rest of it ^_____^.Shrimp and grits - mmmm. We don't really have grits up in Canada. So this was a real treat for me. I'm also mildly allergic to shrimp (doesn't always affect me and I always carry over the counter allergy medicine in case), this one didn't give me any reaction. It had big pieces of clean shrimp. I would get this again. BBQ ribs - fall of the bone, came with a pile of skinny fries. A little kick of spice on the meat. BBQ Shrimp - I didn't end up eating this because it came with the head and skin attached. I was worried about getting a reaction or else I would have been all over these. I know my limit = (. Everyone else enjoyed these. Wagyu tartar - I enjoyed this, but I didn't see the quail egg on the side (still in its shell). Therefore I didn't get to mix in the egg before I took my portion. It was still good though! Our table also got scallops, ahi tuna bites, burgers, & hummus that I didn't get to try. The others did enjoy those items too. I'm sure I'm missing a couple of items... but I don't rmb since I didn't take out my phone to take a million pics this time. Again I was with ppl I had just met. If I am ever back in Dallas, I will come back for the mussels and I would wanna try their tomahawk steak and other drink items."}, {"review_id": "Ol06KAkoDFwWcITznCwf7w", "user_id": "U0zs7ThbC6JyInUkBN7qRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Had a great dinner at Meddlesome Moth.

The champagne they used was seemingly top shelf.Decor is interesting!!!!A blend of medieval with a modern twist yet classy at the same time.  The Brunch menu had an item for everyone and depending on personal tastes.  I had the Mother & Child reunion which is fried chicken breast, topped with poached eggs over homemade grits.  It was nothing extraordinary, rather blend in my opinion. My friend however ordered the special which was a burger, topped with bacon, eggs and topped with glazed donuts.  From a visual perspective, it looked awesome.  The feedback was that it tasted amazing as well.Our service was great.  No complaints there!

Listen, nobody's greens are better than my mama's....however, MM is on to something here. The greens were cooked with real bacon and served with a slice of the biggest, thickest, sexiest piece of cornbread I've ever seen. It's meant to be shared but I ate half of the bowl myself. #noshame I grabbed a fork full that happened to have a piece of bacon fat on it and I thought I had died and went to heaven. It was so good. I know someone is reading this and thinking \"ew,  bacon fat,\" and to you I say...good riddance. Lol The beef sticks were also very good, tender and full of flavor. A great pair with the greens. I had an apricot smash to drink and it was $9ish and served in a champagne flute. Umm, where's the rest of it?My issue is with the service, or lack thereof. We literally had to flag down our waitress every single time we needed something. She never checked back in with us and we were sitting right next to their service area.

Most of the dishes I order here are well outside the comfort zones of my basic beech friends. Here's a run down of my favorites:- Rabbit pot pie: a very hearty dish, this is one I always have all to myself as my friends do not eat bunnies. The crust is thin and crispy, unlike the flaky puff pastry top that most pot pies in the US are served with.- Chicken skin chips: if you, like me, believe that the best part of fried chicken is the crunchy skin, this is the snack for you (and me). - Bone marrow: nicely roasted and topped with chimichurri, this is a tasty appetizer. Bone marrow seems to have become a staple at most restaurants serving Modern American fare, and Meddlesome Moth's version is as good as any in the nation (in my experience, anyway). - Moth balls: baked ricotta cheese balls topped with parmesan and olive oil. - Nashville hot quail: great flavor; not as excrutiatingly hot as traditional Nashville hot chicken.
