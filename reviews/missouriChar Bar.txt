This is one place that I can take out-of-town visitors to experience some Kansas City BBQ and still be able to enjoy a meal other than just french fries.Enter: The Jackknife. With a little modification, you can order this with smoked jackfruit, avocado slices, pickled jalapenos, pickled onions, and a sweet and savory BBQ sauce. Jackfruit has been one of my favorite meat substitutes and I think even meat-eaters could agree on that. In the land of BBQ, it's nice to still be able to enjoy what KC is known for. Outside of food, Char Bar has a great outdoor bar with a nice beer selection. It's definitely the place to be to be when it's nice outside, where you can have fun playing corn-hole or ping-pong in the courtyard!"}, {"review_id": "cMFYSdGnXtLACFOrzaH4fQ", "user_id": "hpzmzgBQ3669os_yR5FUxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Always a fun time at Char Bar. There's so much outdoor seating, dogs are allowed, fun games, great service, and good drinks. It's not my favorite place for BBQ, but I also won't deny it if offered.I mainly come for the drinks and to live in the lovely, energetic atmosphere. EVERYONE is having a good time, always. Tonight I came for dinner, the first time in a really long time. We had an amazing server (thanks for taking care of us, Church) who recommended the Jo Jo fries, a side I've never ordered before. The potato is cut into uneven chunks/wedges, fried, then fried in cheese (I think). So good. I also love the kale pecorino slaw. Perhaps my favorite side there. I ate it as a salad, super fresh and tart with great texture to it. Come with a group of friends; stay for a good time. It's always a place I take my out of town friends. I mean, if it's good enough for Caitlin Jenner, it's good enough for me. #amiright"}, {"review_id": "R0Y11EqQzqpx121khWIm_g", "user_id": "9Nx0VL4f_8K6V6yfFLue1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "In a land of chimpanzees I was a monkey.

They serve it with a classic local sweet BBQ sauce that has the locally required lacing of cumin.  It would not be Kansas City BBQ without it.  The jack fruit BBQ os very much like pulled pork. They also have a very respectable Cole slaw to enjoy on the side. The bar part of the Char Bar features a wide selection of beers, including local brands on draft.

There was one waiter who was very nice and willing to help get extra chairs and what not, but our waitress was not very nice and or accommodating. The food was good. I got what I thought was a sampler plate thing on the app menu, it said there were grits, sausage, burnt ends and something else but it was that stuff covered in sauce on top of the grits...I just wasn't expecting that and it was okay. The meat was good! We also order mac and cheese, that was good but not worth whatever they charge and if you get the $4 brisket on top it's 3 pieces just fyi. OMG the corn bread was amazing though! I want some of those as I'm typing!

Definitely not your average hush puppies. These ones are topped with cheese and jam (though I don't remember the jam last time so they may change the toppings every once in a while). Everyone says burnt ends are the thing to get but I changed my mind at the last second after hearing our waiter rave about the wings. It comes with 4 huge wings drenched in a sweet and spicy sauce. It was great, but I wouldn't say it's one of the best things on the menu. The sweet potato fries though...those were perfect. Perfectly fried with the perfect amount of salt.I came here once in the warmer months and sat outside, which I'd argue is one of the best features of this place since it's filled with a bunch of classic summertime activities (e.g. Bocce).

I dined alone so the noise from the bar didn't bother me one bit. The restaurant and bar was busy. This is the first weekend of the NCAA men's basketball tournament so lots of attention paid to the TVs at the bar. The service: second to none. I made a reservation so I was seated around the time of my res. The greeter and seater was gentlemanly. He had suggestions for the menu but I already knew what I wanted. He was patient and affirmed my choices. My waiter was attentive in the perfect amount... he navigated the busy bar/restaurant area and made sure I never wanted for anything - refill on my drink. He checked on me after the food was served. Josh was very engaging. The food: OMG!! I had the Burnt Heaven sandwich and the cheesy hush puppies. Without going into great detail, I can say that I have loved my burnt ends experiences at Oklahoma/KC Joe's... and I would put these burnt ends up there (highly ranked). I will definitely return the next time I visit KC. And I'm hoping I'll get to that aforementioned competitor during this weekend's visit.

I branched out on my last visit and got the house made pork rinds and they were amazing!!! Nothing like you would buy in a bag at the store. I've gotten the brisket and bbq chicken salad, as well as the wings and all were really good. Oh and their ranch is out of this world! The only downside for me is their bbq sauce.. which is a huge part of bbq obviously. They have two types of sauce: a table sauce, and an actual bbq sauce. The table sauce is almost like a hot sauce, it's really thin and has a kick. The bbq sauce is thick and extremely sweet. I ended up mixing a little of the table sauce with the bbq sauce to tame the overwhelming sweetness."}, {"review_id": "V_h1xzl5klO2T36nRIT3TQ", "user_id": "s7R8XrRuqO-cS8ghPZ9f9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Fantastic Brunch! Brisket and eggs with potatos and a hollandaise sauce (surprisingly) competing with those found in classic diners. The mac-n-cheese was also an unexpected treat; I was so tempted to order more to take home. The only problem(?) was underestimating brunch portions... but then that's why to-go boxes were invented.If you're not a fan of crowds and noise, come early. I came at the right time, around 10:30am, before the rush, and it definitely gives a different vibe than during lunch/dinner hours. Service is always friendly, no matter the hours.For BBQ, Char Bar has pretty standard pricing, comparable to Gates and Q39. But I think, at least for brunch, they have wider selection of options.

It's a perfect place go to go during the Spring or summer time when you want to grab a beer and hang out in the back yard.  It is a pretty good size the restaurant that has chill vibes written all over it.  In terms of barbecue, they have some of the best barbecue sandwiches in Kansas City, especially the burnt heaven sandwich! I would say the BBQ on its own, such as the burnt ends or brisket, you can find better options. But the sandwiches here are creative and there are even vegetarian options like the jack fruit sandwich which is hard to find in most bbq restaurants.

Half of their seating is outdoors in the massive patio area. I wouldn't have expected their brunch to be so spectacular. My friends and I tried it one weekend and were pleasantly surprised. We have been back countless times since then. The biscuits and gravy is my favorite menu item, and arguable some of the best in the city. They also have a surprising number of vegetarian options, including mushroom gravy for the B&G. If you're out to brunch with a group of friends, consider getting the icky sticky. It's a giant cinnamon bun that comes out hot and gooey. It's only $5 and is so much fun to rip into. If you're allergic to nuts, know that it has pecans. I'm not sure at what stage of the baking process they're added, but they are on the top of the bun. So, it's possible that it isn't until the bun is nearly ready to be served; ask your server to see if you can get it without the pecans. At any rate, if you aren't interested in biscuits and gravy, I suggest the blackberry French toast."}, {"review_id": "obzmiToIFR7BhiyaArUIUA", "user_id": "JMjLz7VkqrxqfmhMxUj-7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Go ahead and make a reservation.
