I came here with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday and it was easily one of the best meals I have had in Billings. I had the salmon with a mushroom Dijon sauce with risotto. It was absolutely incredible. The service was great, our waitress was awesome and made the experience even better.

They rotate their menu monthly, get fresh fish shipped from Hawaii weekly, and most importantly they have fun with the food. Hubby and I came here on a Saturday night for date night, and everything on the menu looked amazing. We started with 2 appetizers as we just couldn't decide and they were full of flavor. I won't belabor our entrees since the menu is always changing, but I will say that my fish was exceptional and he was floored by the expert preparation of his octopus and quail. We had to have dessert so we tried the chef's version of tiramisu and were not disappointed. Even more exciting was the price!! Yes, it was pricey, this isn't Applebee's folks, but it was reasonably priced for the high-quality ingredients, excellent preparation and all around experience we received. They only serve wine and beer, and the list is relatively short, but we were pleased with our bottle of wine. Staff was lovely. And the cherry on top is the cute Victorian home that has been repurposed into the restaurant. We were fortunate to be able to meet the chef, and he was an incredibly delightful and warm person. He joked that at his age he should be retired but he's still having too much fun - I loved that! He chatted with us for about 10 minutes and it was so special. Seriously, one of our top 10 most exceptional dining experiences, EVER! And since the menu changes monthly, I'm so excited to check them out month after month, and for lunch too!! Each month I have no doubt he'll serve something that meets my craveable requirements, and I look forward to my next visit."}, {"review_id": "ppQIEuAd4jFXwSLEwfe7UQ", "user_id": "ZRnsUs9q6DbeJbOLjCY4ZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "Cool setting here in residential area west side of downtown. So I'm the first customer in this evening. Beautiful here. An Apple pot pie dessert coming. Already had a sushi app and some beautiful bread here now. Pelligrino to drink no ice. My favorite. A Spearfish dinner enroute. Apple pie is excellent. Nice salad with a plum sauce dressing. Nice. Sourdough bread is excellent. The fish is wonderful and on a bed of grits. Sure enough all perfect here, including service from a very pleasant lady. Absolutely must return for...further testing!!"}, {"review_id": "0x5sbBJR9V9EEfLem9YW_A", "user_id": "mSjQX56lT1BmSL1A8YDkYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "This is a quaint old Victorian  building neatly tucked in near the heart Billings MT.

My opinion is that it has been difficult to recommend a place around billings due to inconsistencies in quality. I believe that food should be memorable which then I can Recommend it to folks that are looking for a great meal with good expectations. I felt very welcome here and liked the ambience. The menu was short and gave a vegan on board I spaced out that they did not have much on the menu the night we went. It wasn't a problem, they adjusted their menu for my friend and made them the best tofu steak she said  they ever had. My tuna steak was so delicious that after two months I still remember the taste and smell. I would recommend calling for reservations rather then just showing up and the dinning outside, you may want to watch the weather guide :).

My wife had a scallop pastry that was to die for! We started the meal off with a Chilean sea bass cheek and crab app that was also 5 star incredible. Did you know that Chilean sea bass is a made up word? The fish is actually called the Patagonian toothfish!The place is kind of hard to find. It's in a residential neighborhood.

I really wanted to love this place, but I was just disappointed. After reading all the great reviews, I thought it had to be good, right? Unfortunately both my husband and I were not impressed...I had the chicken which came with risotto and vegetables. Both the risotto and the veg were very bland. There was also some pickled red cabbage and the juice from that was running into everything else on the plate. The chicken was not anything special... It did have brie and prosciutto on top, but it tasted too salty for me.My husband had the steak and prawns. He said the steak was very fatty and it was maybe about 6 ounces. He did say the prawns were excellent. I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Juliano's. It was quiet and we sat outside on the patio.

For my visit he had planned a romantic dinner for two at an upscale steakhouse (I know, \"Awww!\") but switched up his game plan when the owner of a local coffee shop recommended Juliano's. His reasoning for passing on the steakhouse was that you can find  places like that just about anywhere. And I can now personally guarantee that there is no place like Juliano's ANYWHERE but Billings, Montana.We took a cab from the hotel, and had not the taxi driver known where the place was located, I certainly would have missed it. Nestled unceremoniously in a residential neighborhood, Juliano's is located inside a converted Victorian home. We sat in the side yard under an umbrella, surrounded by twinkling Christmas lights and beautiful paintings mounted on the fence. There was even a table of people eating in the outdoor gazebo. The upstairs bedrooms have also been converted to restaurant seating, and the antique bathtub in the ladies room has been converted into a table using a slab of marble and a vase of flowers. When I think of the menu at Juliano's, the words \"eclectic\" and \"inventive\" come to mind. We tried Juliano's \"Wine of The Week\", a silky pinot noir, as well as a delicious and velvety miso corn chowder appetizer. I got an absolutely incredible entree of grilled octopus, braised pork belly and blue cheese lasagna, and my boyfriend got a succulent filet mignon wrapped in bacon and topped with apples and blue cheese. Things To Know:- As we took a cab, I did not happen to notice what the parking situation is like. Call ahead to find out!- If you've never been to Montana, you should know they have very strict policies regarding alcohol. So even if you are 4 times the legal drinking age, be prepared to show your ID. Additionally, there is a 3-drink per night statewide maximum, so if you think you're going to wrangle your old frat bro's and get schwastey-face Montana-style, you can think again.- DO take advice from the locals! We never would have had the opportunity to enjoy this truly unique dining experience had Boyfriend not chatted up the owner of the local coffee shop. As I sit writing this review from the food court of a Minneapolis airport scarfing down chicken and lo mein from the ever-classy \"Wok N Roll\", I am dreaming wistfully of the good old days when I supped on exotic delicacies and drank wine hand selected by a master, all in a setting to rival Tavern on the Green--you know...yesterday."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianos-restaurant-billings?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
