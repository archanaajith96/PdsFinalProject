We tried to make a reservation for 10 people via voice mail but did not have success. Even so, we were seated within 30 minutes, might have been even quicker if our whole group arrived at the same time. We were able to sit at the bar and order drinks while we waited though. After 6pm the line was out the door (cold outside!) and no room to wait at bar so I recommend being an early bird. The bartenders were fun to watch and they have creative, drinks with fresh and interesting ingredients.Our waiter was funny and energetic and totally upsold us on everything... but sometimes when you are out on the town and feeling it and spending money you just want that. Sure I'll take extra everything. Sure, that sounds good! He had good recommendations and we were all pleased with everything. Food was really good, I think we ordered close to every type of arepa and everyone loved their choice. We sat on the patio which was comfortable but bring sunglassess if sun is setting... if you're facing the window the sun will blind you the whole time. Can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "gzMmwR8uOibgPmOeULTaHg", "user_id": "lfjCrPHiB03aLeh6DFMSLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Hola Arepa is pretty good. There was a lot of amplification around going to Hola Arepa so I was expecting some really good stuff. Expectations were set a little too high I think! The food was tasty and it came out quickly but I would describe it as \"fine.\" Your tastebuds will have a sensation of joy but soon realize there may be other latin restaurants that tickle them a little more.

I've been back to Hola Arepa enough times to have my initial very positive impression reinforced. Business seems as brisk as ever. So apparently many others appear to hold favorable views as well. To my previous list of recommended items, I'll add what might be my new favorite, the Cuban Ham and Pork Arepa. This variation on a Cubano is rich, savory and deeply satisfying. The Tortilla Chips with 3 salsas (select from 4 options) could be more generously served. The salsas each have a distinct and flavorful profile. The mild Hola Sauce has a pleasant sweet/sour tang. The mild/medium Tomatillo Sauce is a tasty if innocuous dip. The medium/hot Red-Chile Tomato salsa has a smoky bite and the Aji Verde with a deceptively creamy texture is a fairly potent flavor bomb. Adding a fresh, bright dollop of Gaucamole is worth the $3.5 upcharge in my estimation.For dessert, the Horchata Pot de Creme (Horchata Creme, cinnamon-sugar, crispy puffed rice and blackberry compote) is densely delicious. May be a bit steep at $6.5 but probably could (should?) be shared to save both calories and $$$."}, {"review_id": "Q6Wnn0iEalBHYiH7dlS6Og", "user_id": "S3nlJPj53-0SLjoAwler_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Finally made it into the actual restaurant!Reformed Heathen Friend and I stopped in here on our usual Thursday night for dinner. Continuing my trend of only picking restaurants that aren't offering \"New American\" fare, I opted for Hola this month because I remembered how good the arepa was that I had delivered once and I knew Heathen Friend had never had such deliciousness.I was expecting it to be busier than it was, but since they keep the patio going during winter with the addition of walls and heaters, they had plenty of space to accommodate us. The server was a bit soft-spoken, which made it a little difficult to hear her at times, but she was happy to repeat herself because she knows she's soft-spoken. So, that worked out, but it did take a little longer to get through orders.We ordered drinks to start: the Weather Permitting and the Feeling Weckless. I originally had the Weather Permitting, but decided I didn't like it. Luckily, Heathen Friend also didn't really like his Feeling Weckless, so we swapped and both were perfectly happy! I found the Weather Permitting too unbalanced and bitterly alcohol-forward, which mostly speaks to my dislike of bitter drinks. Heathen Friend found the Feeling Weckless too spicy, which was probably the spiced chipotle syrup and the ancho (chile) liqueur doin' it's magic. I found it perfect and didn't even notice any spiciness.We started with the Plantain Tostados. I felt the plantain was a little too crispy for my liking, but Heathen Friend really liked it. It's a YMMV kind of situation. For the main event, I had the Cuban Ham and Pork with the aioli. It was AMAZING. Oh my gosh, it's even better than the last arepa I had from here. It was like the perfect Cuban without all the heavy bread. Heathen Friend went with another one (I can't remember which!) and also loved his. I think he's now an arepa fan!We were way too full from the arepas to manage any dessert, though I'd be interested to try them sometime.Parking is small lot or free street in the 'hood.Is it crazy for me to say I want to try every arepa on the menu? No? Good! I'm gonna do it!"}, {"review_id": "8JeUEQWiK5mrEJ72qvUQRw", "user_id": "j08_Upv3sN3wmuCrHp0Prg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "I have renamed this restaurant Holy Arepa! because I think it flows better and is appropriate. Try it!Pros: The food! I was here with my 40-something book club ladies and we were hungry so somebody ordered chips and salsa and somebody else added on guacamole. You think you know what to expect from chips/salsa/guacamole but this was a fancy presentation of three different salsas. The chips were light and just perfectly delicious, all three of the sauces were unique and delicious. I don't know what they did to the guacamole but it was something special and delicious too. I went with the server recommended a Chorizo Arepa. It was about the size of my hand, so not huge but the corn bread tortilla like rounds were very filling. The chorizo pieces were a tad too crunchy for me, but the yucca fries were very hot and delicious. I went with her recommended sauce which was the Aioli, num!Cons: No one seems to like their job at this restaurant. We had a table right by the bar by where the servers put in their orders on the computer so I can assure you that I don't think any servers smiled ever. Ours was certainly attentive and the food was fast but she didn't seem to be enjoying her job. And they were very rigid about getting us a table. The whole group had to be together before they would give us a table and if you're sitting at the bar you have to be ordering food (this was written on a little blue tented sign) so I guess maybe they were too busy to think they needed to concentrate on customer service? I've never seen a host so cranky. And the group ordered a dessert, I didn't have any, but I've never seen this group of four women not be able to finish a dessert that was maybe three fourths of a cup. It had some berries, not sure the name, they were trying to analyze why they didn't like it, I guess it was not overly sweet and not compelling? Anyhow, go for the mostly delicious food and the lovely South American ambiance!"}, {"review_id": "RQSIp5f_esNPROgPR07pAw", "user_id": "iRwVOc-Q1DW1tT0MuTK4kQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "4.5 stars. Stopped by on a Saturday morning. The color theme of the restaurant immediately caught my eye - a beautiful teal. Parking there isn't the greatest, it's a small lot but there is street parking all around. There's an outside seating area that is heated, so even during the winter it's available! (You might get a little breeze on your ankles.) The menu is pleasing to the eye and easy to understand. I ordered the chorizo sausage and egg arepa. I can't have beans so I asked for them to be taken out and asked if I could have them replaced with pickles. She said of course, with a 50 cent charge. Was craving pickles at that time so I didn't mind. When the arepa came out, it looks absolutely delicious...except my pickles weren't there. I ended up just telling the waitress so take them off the bill since I didn't want to wait for them to start eating. She apologized and said she included them in the ticket for the kitchen and didn't know why they weren't there, but that she'd take them off the bill. They still ended up on the bill, which was slightly annoying, but she made sure to go and fix it right away. The arepa was amazing. Probably the best meal I've had in the Minneapolis area. The entire combination of the runny egg, chorizo, and pickled cabbage was just perfect. It looks small, but is very filling! When I first got my dish I saw the four fries it came with and thought to myself \"that's it?!\" I took that thought back as soon as I dived into the arepa. By the time I got to the fries I was pretty full. I will say, I wasn't a huge fan of the fries. The texture was just a bit different for me. My friend loved them though! At the end of our meal we decided to try out the mini \"churro.\" Two things:  It's not mini and it's not a churro. Brutally honest, it was just a bunch of crumbs of a dry cake molded into the shape of a churro. We couldn't get a piece of it without it falling into 10 different pieces. It was also so dry that we ended up drowning it in the chocolate sauce so some of it would stick together in order for us to eat it. Would not recommend this at all."}, {"review_id": "Zgdk732lArkRuYpAYtsTjA", "user_id": "UFWlJmnRin24VWqdXpuCXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Such a solid place!

For a gluten free gal like me, it was so amazing to see a menu that was entirely gluten free unless otherwise noted... usually it's the other way around! The cocktail menu is impressive. Super fun drinks that feel fun and summery all year round. I got the \"Locked Up Abroad\" and it was delicious. Just sweet enough, but not overwhelmingly so. The table shared chips and salsa with salsas #1, 2, and 3. All were tasty and unique flavors, but the Red-Chile Tomato was especially good. I got the Shredded Beef and Plantain arepa with yucca fries and aioli verde. It was AMAZING. The corn cake was incredibly soft and moist, not dry or crumbly. The meat was well seasoned and the plantains gave the right sweet textural kick to balance out the pickled onions served on top. Overall the food, ambience, and service were a 5 out of 5.

I recently got myself to finally try it out.The interior is a nice break from the chilly weather we're currently experiencing with a tropical atmosphere to it.I was able to order off of the happy hour menu which was priced very fairly and had several appealing options. We started off with tortilla chips that came with the option of 3 salsas. It was nice to have the variety, especially being someone who likes really spicy things; other people don't always appreciate when I order extra spicy food items. I also had the slow roasted pork arepa. It doesn't come with yuca fries on the HH menu but the person I was with ordered some so I got to taste them. Oooh! Those fries are sooo good!! I really enjoyed the sandwich as well. It had a ton of flavor and the portion size was generous.The entire experience was fantastic.

In Minnesota???\" But the hunger kept me from arguing and I went with it.Thank goodness for that because Hola Arepa is delicious! And that wasn't just the hunger talking. I wisely chose the breakfast arepa and added their slow-roasted pork. The plate came with yucca fries and our kind server let us sample all three sauces: chimichurri, aioli, and a jalapeño salsa. All three were wonderful. I was hungry and couldn't help myself from cleaning my plate off, but could easily have walked away satisfied had I split it with my sister.
