Every moment of our experience was wonderful. We have never felt so catered to. This restaurant is far and above any dining experience I have had in Connecticut.We were seated at a table that had a light sprinkle of birthday confetti on it along with a birthday card from the restaurant. The staff is extremely professional and attentive. They seem to have a good eye for when to approach the table to see to our needs, careful not to interrupt while the conversation was in progress. The staff really goes above and beyond what is expected. They treated us like VIP's the entire evening. The food is phenomenal! We had a four course meal and I don't think I could pick a favorite food item because each was so wonderfully prepared, from the presentation to the flavors, it is a foodie's paradise! Their menu selections are very thoughtfully created and the seasonings are subtle and really enhance the food.Expect to be wowed when you dine at Capital Grille. From the complimentary valet parking to the impeccable customer service and delicious culinary delights, you will enjoy your experience here."}, {"review_id": "GT3wJkhmgelVdPuC3VbI-g", "user_id": "OPhtcSe1DXYajVM4m2JEMQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "2/2018Great place. The building is beautiful and well needed in Hartford.  Our food was very good. Everything you would expect from a great steakhouse.  Wines (Clos DuVal) was a perfect match and completely over pricesd as you would expext from a steakhouse too but the three of us didnt care and had two bottles. Those on an expense account are destined for here.  Service was ok. Not great. Not special. Kinda quick-quick hurry and get out attitude so \"I\" (server) can turn the table and make more money.  Was underwhelming. We  stayed despite the fast food chain TGIF/Applebees service and enjoyed ourselves.  But, in the end it left us wanting. Ive been to the Cap in Providence and Philly and the experience was much, much better. But of course there is more competition too 4/2018Since the time above I have been back twice and ate at the bar and it was great!  The food is always amazing. Never had a bad steak. Their bone in filet is huge, tender and very satisfying.  The rib eye is my favorite and never dissapoints. Bar service is fantastic and fun. My favorite steakhouse when in the area."}, {"review_id": "kgta2Cu5D5EEJanlwzWctQ", "user_id": "3JHY8kD9WnDyh602N7fN_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "I always have high expectations when going to Capital Grille - and so far they have been met or exceeded.  Though typically a higher-priced dinner option reserved for more special occasions, the Capital Grille on Front Street always participates in the \"Taste of Hartford\" (typically once in the summer and once in the winter).  You honestly can't beat the $30.00 deal for three delicious courses (less than the cost of your typical steak entrée).  Always book your reservation in advance because they tend to fill up during those weeks. They offer free valet, so worrying about the ever-dreaded parking issue in Hartford is not an issue. Portions have always been perfect, and the food is always cooked exactly to our liking.  I've had great luck with our waiters/waitresses taking allergy requests seriously at this location.  I definitely need to give a shout-out to Shea, our most recent waiter.  He really went above and beyond making our meal wonderful - he was very attentive and knew the menu and specials like the back of his hand.My one complaint about this location would be in regards to the lighting.  It is always much too dark.  They bypassed the romantic atmosphere when you can't see your food.  Please turn up those dimmers a bit - I think it would enjoy it much more!"}, {"review_id": "mg-TisUqYTu9kcMxffmhjg", "user_id": "9GGNIrkCN0Rk0cSmMrPEVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Food is almost always cooked to perfection and the service is amazing friendly can't do enough for you.

First I want to truly thank Dave our waiter he was sooooo knowledgeable and gave great compliments about the Brunch and Dinner Menus. He had great detail and extremely attentive to our needs. The Brunch had an excellent selection. I could go on and on about Capital Grille I haven't had one bad dish. The ambiance is very cozy and the fact that every time I dine at Capital Grille I have one of the best tables right in front of the kitchen. I love to see whats going on in the kitchen. I enjoy watching all the teamwork and all the food and that's a foodie fact. If you're visiting CT or just passing thru CT and want an absolutely delicious meal Capitol Grille is your spot."}, {"review_id": "Z7zPtbAta_OZ-HtXq8KgoQ", "user_id": "DuNi6Rgk8eZjFahCyFxp6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Capital Grille has been a great addition to Hartford's Font Street area. I am always pleased with the food and of course the customer service. My favorite waitress here is Brittany. I've come in for both a date night and also with a huge party and Brittany made both experiences amazing. She has a great knowledge of the menu and can make recommendations to suite your needs. My favorite cocktail here is the Mojito and for food I usually go with a classic Filet and Potatoes. I've also been for special events like Valentine's Day where they go the extra mile by providing dipped strawberries and fresh flowers to guests!"}, {"review_id": "b3CekeHIQlDHNX8iYRJu8g", "user_id": "Top1bPx5sHyPQuBbT7Bq2w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Upscale restaurant.

The lobster is fresh and sweet, and the bitterness of the salad paired up perfectly with the lobster. The clam chowder is alright, a little watery to me, but the flavor is there.

We dined as a party of five and while the food was incredible, I can't say enough about the service, especially our server Kathi N. Supremely capable, she was funny and warm and genuinely happy to serve us. The restaurant took note of the fact that it was graduation and (without needing to be asked) decorated the table and provided gifts for the two graduates. It was also remarkable how well the entire service team worked together to make sure everyone's meal arrived hot and on time. The Capital Grill is not inexpensive, but for a special meal or occasion, they do not disappoint!"}, {"review_id": "gL7B1Y8qXK5S0VYyJV2ISw", "user_id": "KfXuvo6syl1LspAbu5N4mQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I've had great luck with our waiters/waitresses taking allergy requests seriously at this location.This was simply a magnificent experience!

We came here for a Valentine's Day dinner. Holidays are always a challenge for restaurants so I usually don't like to judge them on these days, but CG was basically flawless.We made an early reservation for right after work, and honestly I think that worked well to our advantage. The place was empty when we arrived, but by the time we left 2 hours later, every table was occupied and people were waiting at the front. Our server Martha was great. Very friendly and knowledgeable, but also didn't hover to give us our space.Food was fantastic all around. We shared the crab appetizer and the buratta and prosciutto salad to start. I have an ongoing love affair with that salad since the last time I had it at the CG in Providence and last night didn't disappoint. The crab dish was very fresh and tasty. I ordered steak for my entree and it was cooked to perfection. Coupled with their amazing mashed potatoes I was one happy camper. The only thing I didn't like was the creamed spinach but bae did so it was all good.The long stemmed roses and chocolate covered strawberries at the end of the night were a nice touch. The heart confetti and rose petals on the table were just enough to be festive without being obnoxious. So happy with our experience here. Looking forward to coming back soon."}, {"review_id": "8KLRN_pmIFHw6kxnvkuu3A", "user_id": "xQRKaba8BfGbMQntlrWZqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Went here during Hartford Restaurant Week.

While their ToH menu does not change too much from season to season, they are solid in their offerings. I had the clam chowder, which was delicious and full of clam, and the 8 ounce filet mignon, which was perfectly cooked. All ToH come will classic mashed potatoes and green beans. Dessert was delicious too; the flourless espresso cake was rich, and the creme brulee had a great texture (though could have used a harder top surface).If you're coming in the summer, definitely opt in for the Generous Pour deal. For less than $30, you can try 7 highly-rated wines and essentially keep drinking the ones you like throughout the rest of the evening. I'll definitely be seeking out some of the wines I tried through GP. The wine was a great compliment to the night and evening.Our waiter, Dave, was professional and kept the wine coming."}, {"review_id": "irve18t7UeoryywozOGsKg", "user_id": "XCC0S5PZ2cWEj_jYl9TNxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "This is *the* place to go all out in Hartford. If you are a wine drinker or a steak connoisseur you have to try Capital Grille. Refined, dedicated service, and a tablet to help you digitally select your drink or choose and dry aged steaks. This place is up my alley big time. A giant glass-enclosed wine cellar can been seen from the host podium.I have been three times. Twice in the dinning area and once at the bar for the Kobe burger and wine pairing deal (an amazing chance to try Caymus Cabernet Sauvignon.) They have complementary valet parking which is his key since who wants to try to find a parking garage in Hartford when you're all dressed up? They start you off with a basket of 5 different types of  bread; a large matzo like sheaf, whole grain roll, pumpernickel and a few others, accompanied with a flat slab of lightly salted butter. I always have to resist devouring all the bread because there's so much more to come to save room for. While we were eating the bread, I enjoyed being able to use a tablet to sort and filter the type of wine we are looking at ordering. This time I skipped the appetizer section and ordered the lobster bisque as my starter; my husband got the New England Clam chowder. For my meal I had the Truffle and Gorgonzola Dry Aged new York strip medium rare. He got the Dry aged Steak Au Poivre With Courvoisier Sauce, which apparently means covered in cracked peppercorns. I'm talking wayyyyy to many pepper corns. I don't fault the restaurant, our server did warn him. I loved my steak and the red reduction sauce that it came with. For our sides we ordered a field green salad for me and lobster mac and cheese for him. The lobster mac and cheese is sinful; super cheesy, which tons of crispy bread crumbs and a decent amount of chopped up lobster claw/tail. Our entrees took a little bit longer to come out so the manager came by and apologized and told us dessert was on them. We didn't even really notice a wait so this was a nice bonus. We had the creme brulee; always delicious."}, {"review_id": "95y7CrwPkkpYDbE0v68OiA", "user_id": "pmw7PNNxe0QDNVUqzFfJjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "The taste of Hartford comes around twice a year so we make sure we schedule a reservation at the Capital Grill.

Service was impeccable as always.  Overall, still love this place.  But, at $ 350 for two.people,  one should expect perfect.  Every time.  And this time, they seriously missed the mark.  As such, I was uncomfortable leaving my previos 5 star rating up.  Will follow up after next visit."}, {"review_id": "1jhKUwAGT7ZlWBuDWKkDCw", "user_id": "9hAxTkGGJpSX0QaBZZ5jWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "Went for the Wagyu and Wine special [$25] and it was certainly something to blow your mind but not your wallet.

For those who aren't familiar, restaurant week provides you a prefixed menu at a fixed price. I applaud Capital Grille for the variety on their menu. There was fish, chicken, and steak being offered. The sides were greens and loaded mashed potatoes. I tried to request mashed potatoes for both plates as my gf and I weren't interested in the greens, but the waiter said they came with both. I was fine w/ that, but when the meals came out there was only a small bowl of greens and a small bowl of mashed potatoes which my gf and I had to share. That was unfortunate since there wasn't enough mashed potatoes for two. The steak was cooked to our liking, but it could have been hotter. We were there at 4:45p on a Friday so we wouldn't think it was busy enough that the food sat around in the kitchen. I wouldn't consider the service slow and the waiter was attentive so the \"cooler\" steak was confusing. The best part of the night was the blackberry whiskey. They weren't stingy with the alcohol, but it still had a hint of blackberry tastes that had me ask for a second. I highly recommend it! Overall, the service wasn't over the top. I probably wouldn't check it out if it's not restaurant week unless I'm stopping in for a happy hour."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-capital-grille-hartford?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
