Whew! That's a lotta directions! Lots or walkers, runners, chillers, and doggies outside on the patio. Multiple levels on the inside if you need a table. Coffee, beer, tea, food like quiches, sandwiches, soup, sweet bites... it's really all here! I could knock it a star for the food not always being that awesome, but... nah. It's such a prime spot it doesn't feel right.Go for a walk or run and stop here before/after. Great parks nearby to fly kites or rent pedal devices."}, {"review_id": "k-a-P_rSs1sANF_UkXPhJg", "user_id": "HtLCevwI6lb9Qp3BfAiVNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Really great space, I loved the building, the finishes and the vibe of the staff and internal decor!Staff was wonderfully friendly and made a great tasting cup of hot chocolate and latte.  Good space to work or talk amongst friends.  I'm a fan!"}, {"review_id": "3gmp6emnLUiVKqSFeVAYQg", "user_id": "hjk2B1A4jvtnXY2bohRytw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "After freezing my fingertips while shooting pictures at Bradford Beach (32 balmy degrees with a 30 mph NW wind on April 6- brrrr), I thought maybe I could regain feeling by administering coffee to myself. Ordered a large Guatemala Hunapú, just a straight up cup o' coffee. It kinda worked! Only took 15-ish minutes for the coffee to cool down enough to be drinkable!Alright- the nitty gritty. This location was PACKED at 2:00 pm on a Friday. The folks behind the counter not quite as friendly as at the Bay View location. Not unfriendly, they just seemed all business. Only seating was up top. My apologies if you were there and I body slammed you with a camera bag, it is kinda tight quarters. Kinda tough climbing stairs with a camera bag and a piping hot cup of coffee. Colectivo's Guatemala okay, I think I'm more a fan of Colombian beans. On getting out, there were at least two cars shuffling back and forth waiting for a parking spot to open up. Marc's tip: If you stare directly into the cinnamon rolls, you will not be able to resist their addictive gravitational pull."}, {"review_id": "LWeE_BHEPKUKErfTuXe2LA", "user_id": "4XKD7S9Ke176RymeBljorQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "tl;dr great remote work spot with the coffee you need to get through the dayColectivo at the Lakefront is my jam for several reasons:1) The wifi - helps me work remote when I have multiple meetings with clients over the course of the day and need to be out of the office and more in downtown MKE turf. Easy to login, accept the terms via the browser and re-sign in if you're there a little over an hour. 2) The space - not only is there an actual parking lot (so you're not fighting and struggling to park like other downtown coffee shops) the space inside and outside is really good, too. You're looking at outdoor patio space with views of the water, indoor first and second floor tables for hunkering down to work or chat and the back area beyond the bathroom that I always seem to forget exists. 3) The coffee - I mark this as 3 because I can get coffee at a lot of places (and I can specifically get Colectivo at other locations of its own downtown) but its the benefits of this building specifically that keeps me coming. I do enjoy the coffee (the standard macchiato or mocha) and have also been getting the mango, peach and ginger smoothie recently. 4) The food - great place to setup if you actually want to do a lunch, I've tried several sandwich and baked good items I've liked.5) The staff - short and sweet - friendly, fairly quick with the drinks and willing to give out recommendations of new things to try."}, {"review_id": "BFAw3jlGBrBK6dLscwgKTA", "user_id": "WThUCJfqNAQa8_cAQvY3OA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "A must see in Milwaukee.

The staff here have always been competent and quick, friendly as ever while still displaying an edge.  I love the breakfast selections, and the pastries are very good. My only gripe is that the small size for drinks is ridiculously small, so order a medium. Staff know this so they show the size of the small cup whenever anyone asks for it.  The seating here is plentiful and the cream city brick beautiful.  I like the layout of the place and the different sections that bring their own unique ambiance .  The outdoor space is great in the warmer weather, and they have an outdoor coffee bar now when the season allows it. Given that it is right off of the Oak Leaf Trail, the location is perfect.I could settle down here."}, {"review_id": "1Z0HmxwETScw4rBziYGF9Q", "user_id": "MN6vTCeRKWU44M7xwhQc7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "I love this location of Colectivo for a myriad of reasons. 1) It's a great place to work. I love getting a mocha, a tucked away table on the second floor, and my laptop and hunkering down. It's cozy and there's high windows to gaze out of when you need a screen break. It's perfect.2) Patio. This location offers a big, beautiful patio directly across the street from McKinley Marina. Colorful tables, sunshine, shade trees, and the lake in the distance? Sign me up. On the regular.3) Great coffee! I tend to go for a mocha and theirs is delish (not overly sweet, high quality chocolate, smooth espresso).4) Solid eats! I've enjoyed lunch here on occasion and have had everything from an anti-oxidant packed fruit smoothie to an avocado BLT. All were a-ok. 5) Bonus? They brew their own, surprisingly good beer! Just enjoyed lunch there recently and opted for beer rather than my usual coffee. They have an imperial stout (Cortado Stout) made with their coffee that is amazing. My dining companions all ordered and enjoyed their Farmhouse Ale.It's a great place to work and one of the first places I bring visitors as well. Colectivo Lakefront is the total package.Get to it!"}, {"review_id": "Sl3iqdp0vplLt66uqB6Z7w", "user_id": "NMI5rk7AJWMjIW-d6o_KRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "This place has become an emotion!

Not only does it have the perfect location, on the waterfront not entirely surrounded by other businesses, but it is a quaint building with a huge patio! Coffee is superb.
