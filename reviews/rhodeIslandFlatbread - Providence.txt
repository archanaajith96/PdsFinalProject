It definitely appeals to that group of youngsters in the area. So many people had been talking about Flatbread and I just never made it to them until just before I leave Providence. I decided to give it a try since it came so highly rated.The first time we tried to go there, we went around 7/8pm on a Friday night and it was packed. The wait was going to be about 40 min whether we ate in or ordered out. We decided that we would then order out on our next attempt. Thank you Grubhub because of you we finally got to try out Flatbreads!Like all the recommendations here we decided to go with the kailua pork pizza and a few others that we designed ourselves. Definitely a solid pizza here with a thinish crust and fresh ingredients! I wasn't disappointed by any means but wasn't as blown away as some other people were. There are so many pizza restaurants in the area and its places like Flatbreads definitely adds to that culture here! Glad there is a place like this downtown to add to our foodie richness."}, {"review_id": "h09yrJsu2LvKhB_UfGsoZw", "user_id": "vUTtfMp_L_p4hIWzg_sqPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Generally I like to get pizza from independent places and stay away from restaurant chains but Flatbread is an exception. All the ingredients are fresh, service is excellent and you get the same feeling as you would at an independent shop. Came in here for Valentines night and had a really good time. We ordered our custom pizza with roasted red peppers, fennel sausage, sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms, and it was great. Two of us did a great job at cleaning up the plates. We also got the brownie sundae and that was good too.

The dough, the cheeses, oils and sauces are just superb! Everything is so fresh and made right from scratch. We had the Jays Heart and the cheese & garlic flatbread. Personal preference would be the cheese and herbs flatbread because wow the herbs/garlic on that thing and all it's cheesy goodness was an overload of senses. I also love how the crust is both soft and crunchy at the same time. The service was fast and friendly. I'm glad our waitress recommended doing half and half of each type on our large flatbread because that way we could sample both. Prices are reasonable and worth it for such good flatbread.

Maybe would be better on a weekday. We arrive (a party of 3) on a Friday evening around 7pm. It's pretty cool they offer free valet, but also pretty random the valet decided they needed to repark our parked car... in the same exact spot. Nevertheless, a nice complementary thing to have. We approach the host stand, making our way through the maze of people congregated in the entire hallway leading up to the host. We ask how long the wait would be, the hostess says 20-25 minutes. We are shocked because this place is packed, but it's a pleasant surprise. Until it wasn't. 25 minutes became 30, which became 35. At the 35 minute mark I inquire how much longer, and the host looks at me like I've just asked her to donate her liver to me. She says \"well, there's still 4 parties ahead of you. People are sitting longer than we expected.\" No, you're just not great at your job I guess. How does 20 minutes turn into 45 \"because people were sitting longer than expected\". Also, how do you not communicate that to anyone waiting. Parties that were waiting when we got there were still waiting when we were eventually seated. Honestly, the moment she said 20 minutes we should've known it was too good to be true. The wait wasn't the problem, especially on a Friday night in this area. The issue was that the host severely under compensated and really didn't care after the fact. Nevertheless, we were seated. Our server, John, immediately approaches us. He is very friendly and attentive. We order 3 pizzas and 1 to go, they had odd names that I can't remember but we ordered a basic cheese, one that had goat cheese and olives etc., and a sausage and mushroom. They were all really really really good! The runners didn't seem to know what they were doing though, they literally tried to hand one of the people in our party the hot pizza- like what? The other member of our party was irked by the fact our server kept moving his beverage around on the table, a pretty random thing to be doing. Despite the ludicrous first portion of the evening, the dining part was great. Even though this is a chain, the restaurant itself has a very \"hipster\" feel. It's cool you can see the wood burning ovens, and watch them stretch the dough etc. the bar was nice as well. This place is quite loud, which is not the desired atmosphere for some, but was fine for us. After we've finished, we go to pay the check with a card. John (server) comes back and says \"I'm really sorry but I accidentally charged your card to that tables bill, but don't worry it'll just say processing for a day. It happens all the time.\" WTF? Why does this happen all the time, John- you just regularly swipe the wrong card for the wrong tab? That's really not a great thing to admit to. Both the tabs were around $50, so now we've just paid $100 at this restaurant for no reason, and John definitely doesn't care. Overall, the food was quite good and definitely unique to other things in the area. However, their staff just cannot own up to any of their mistakes. The host staff was terrible, and John was great up until the point he just assumed it was fine that he just charged us $100 for no reason. If I were to return, it would likely be on a weekday, because this establishment can not handle the weekend crowds properly."}, {"review_id": "_TNl7cmyEnZr_uHUuiEqeQ", "user_id": "e3YKpXsJkh0828evZLb2wg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "While it might take you a while to find parking, Flatbread is a can't miss restaurant on Thayer Street.

A table for 2 was about a 30 minute wait on a Friday night at 7:30 ish. That was fine and expected, as Liz and I just walked around Thayer street while we waited. My friend said she went in the best date ever here. I have to agree it's a cozy casual place that's not too loud and not too bright. I would veer toward it being more of a college date restaurant, not \"adult\" date restaurant; as it is not as intimate as one could be looking for. Regardless, it has wooden themed decor and furniture with two eye catching stone ovens. The chefs make the pizzas right in front of the dining room, and there is basically no separation between the kitchen and the diners other than the stations they use to roll out the dough. Liz is a big bbq chicken fan, so we split a large 1/2 moxie pork pie (basically a bbq pork pizza with chicken substituted for pork) and 1/2 cheese and herb. I was much more interested in my company than focusing on the food. When the flatbread arrived, I was a bit surprised to find out that the cheese and herb did not come with red sauce. That was completely okay and that half of the pizza tasted like some good cheesy breadsticks. The real kicker was the moxie pie (bbq chicken) side had pineapple. I repeat, pineapple on pizza. Take this lesson and never make the same mistake I did by not reading the menu descriptions. The service was very friendly (and young). Our waitress was pretty attentive and kept our water glasses full. Clientele in the restaurant ranged from a few families to college kids to some younger couplesThis place is great if you're a cheap f*** like me. Their menu has no app offerings except a few measly salad options. No table bread even though I feel like they could whip up some Bertuccis type rolls in their stone ovens. Liz felt bad that we barely spent anything, $13 including tax and tip. But I didn't mind, it meant I could spend a few dollars on dessert on Thayer."}, {"review_id": "5cA0xHPCFR3hr7vf2bhq2g", "user_id": "nQToWCF1iqcohfr0ITq1ZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "Such a hipster spot!
