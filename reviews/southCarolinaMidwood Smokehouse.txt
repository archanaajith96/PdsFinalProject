We moved here to Columbia in November and have been eying Midwood Smokehouse ever since. Who knows why it took us so long to finally jump in and give it a try?!Anyways, a Friday evening we finally go for it with our four young children. We only waited about 10 minutes for a patio table and started to browse the menus. All staff was welcoming and friendly and our waiter was just amazing. So helpful, patient, and attentive. My drink never got below a quarter of a glass before he was coming back to refill it. Our food was served quickly and you could tell everything was made FRESH. My burger (The Hot Mess) was juicy and bursting with flavor and my husband's ribs were some of the best I've ever tasted... those kind that just fall of the bone. Yum.We were also surprised with pricing! Usually feeding our family at a restaurant can get a little pricey but Midwood's prices are great! We were surprised when we got our bill how much lower it was than what we had calculated. The patio seating is my favorite part. The ambience of it was so relaxing and we didn't feel rushed at all.  We will definitely be back and recommend this place to all our family and friends."}, {"review_id": "V_8qkXsKYDbSle6nd8Yo_A", "user_id": "8OZEER43TDga3_tXSkJckA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "On our most recent visit I got the BBQ Chicken Sandwich which is pulled chicken topped with coleslaw, their signature SC Mustard BBQ and lettuce. Listen, this sandwich is GOOD! If you're like me you'll want extra BBQ sauce, but no worries your waiter/waitress will drop a whole bottle off for you to sauce it up your way! You also get a choice of one side, and you CANNOT go wrong with the hush puppies.. you'll only be sad when you realize you're eating the last one.Kelsay ditched the carbs and got the chopped BBQ chicken plate, in the Mustard sauce as well. Her plate came with hush puppies and one side, so she chose the sweet potato fries. Normally sweet potato fries are easy to mess up, either they are too soft or burnt to a crisp, but Midwood has got their recipe down to  perfection! We normally get just the Mustard BBQ sauce so this time we asked to try the spicy habanero BBQ. If you like heat, this sauce is for you!"}, {"review_id": "lXuZXLHvSyXAcG64Qc5x5Q", "user_id": "TG1wSQfmZDF3o3uws3tfgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "First time here and so glad we came.

My sister and I browsed the menu while we waited for our waiter.While looking at the menu, I noticed that Midwood had a variety of BBQ! Our waiter Will came to our table and was very knowledgeable of the menu. He took our drink orders, water! He expressed his love of the The Roadhouse sandwich,($8.99)which my sister ordered. It was a beef patty with a few slices of brisket, with lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard and cheese. She had that with a side of hush puppies.  I decided to go with the ($9)smoke wings with blue cheese dressing and a side of ($3.50)mac and cheese! WHOA!! The mac and cheese was freakin AWESOME!! Will suggested I try their BBQ sauces. They had a vinegar based, sweet and smokey and a mustard sauce.  I really enjoyed the mustard flavor one. We enjoyed our meals and were stuffed, couldn't dream about eating dessert! Thanks Midwood Smokehouse!

I searched on Yelp and came across this place & saw that it had really good reviews, so I decided to check it out. The restaurant itself was modern, but still had a lot of character and had somewhat of an old school feel---from the pictures on the restaurant & bathroom walls to the menu and plating, one could tell that everything was well thought out. Let's get to what you really care about though---the food. I got the half rack of ribs with the smokehouse sauce, hush puppies, and collard greens. This being my first time eating ribs in SC, I had high expectations for the food. I was honestly disappointed. The ribs were really dry and even the end of it felt like jerky. It tasted as though these ribs had been cooked over an hour ago and had been sitting in a warmer. I was expecting \"fall of the bone\" type of ribs and these ones fell short of that. The hush puppies and the collard greens were good though. I just wish that the main part of the dish would've won my tastebuds over. Hopefully if I ever go back to SC, I can try something else and have a better food experience. Despite my food expectations not being met, the customer service was great!! I told my server Madison that I was visiting from CA, so she took the time to explain some of the food, different beer options, and offered some recommendations. I sat over at the bar afterwards and was served by Sam. She was easy to talk to and offered some reviews on the local beers. I also saw that the manager was very hands on in the restaurant, so it showed that he had a vested interest into the business. Food experience: 3/5. Service: 5/5."}, {"review_id": "QAPB56CIwOKdCLhVPjHFHg", "user_id": "dhF-BtaM62hDPUXEqIAyMg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "After a 17 hour drive into SC, my husband recommended this BBQ joint, located in Columbia. The surrounding area isn't bad at all, and the parking is sufficient, as it's located in a little outlet with smaller stores and restaurants. We walked in on a Friday evening, so the 20 minute wait was to be expected. There isn't much seating for those who are waiting; however, they have a great system where they can text you when they're ready to seat you, so you can easily sit in your car and wait, or check out the smaller stores around. While we settled down and was served our drinks, we admired the decor which had a casual, rustic feel. The atmosphere was very busy and loud, but stemmed from the conversations between guests, enjoying each other's company. They have a couple TVs, playing sports and a bar towards the back wall. The service was nice-- you don't get the feeling that you're forgotten since other wiorkers will ask if you're doing okay too. On to the food though-- we ended up waiting a bit longer than I expected, but was told that they had to make fresh Burnt Ends so it was longer than normal. -(20-30 minutes) I ordered the Beef Brisket- half lean and fat. It was incredibly tender and was the perfect amount of lean and fat. Although it lacked salt, the great part is that salt is always provided at each table and it tasted amazing with just a pinch. They provide three different sauces: sweet BBQ, honey mustard, and a vinegar based sauce. I preferred the sweet BBQ, as it paired well with the brisket. I also had the creamed corn, which very buttery and creamy and had some chunks of jalapeños. The hush puppies were fluffy in the middle and crunchy on the outside. They were the perfect bite sized pieces. My husband had the Burnt Ends with the Mac&Cheese with $1 toast. Like I previously stated, the Burnt Ends were freshly made, which resulted in it being one of the most tender meats my husband has ever had. We didn't much care for the Mac & Cheese but I may be biased since I'm very picky about that dish. It was thicker than I liked but to each it's own. The $1 toast was alright. I would prefer more butter and to cook it a little longer but it was a $1, so not too bad. At the end of the meal, we felt satisfied and left pleased. We didn't end up taking home leftovers because it was that good . I would definitely recommend this pit if you're looking for great BBQ with great service. But if you're starving and impatient, maybe check out another place, but id say it's worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "iJ3gyzarKnSqhwgIHGuwNw", "user_id": "FacdHw14C4WZoNX44ZmY-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "I ordered the smoked chicken and brisket.

We Drove past this place many times and my family and I really wanted to try it out because we always saw a lot of people! So we finally tried this place and was somewhat impressed. The interior first off is clean and modern. But the front entrance where you talk to the hostess is so so so small you'd have to wait outside. The bar is where you pick up to go. We ordered to go food got the ribs and did the \"pig out\" 2 orders which is around $34 ish dollars and smoked wings (which were amazing would totally go again just for the wings!) The ribs we got the sauce on the side and they were actually pretty good & not dry! The bbq sauces were delicious my favorite was the habanero. We got the Mac and cheese which was ok not that great, we loved the collared greens and the BAKED BEANS were freakin good those were the best would go back just to eat this lol... they were spicy I'm pretty sure but hey we love spicy it was perfect.*Was disappointed in the sides and how small they were... super small. When you order the pig out well 2 of them you'd expect to have bigger portions of sides... literally the ribs 4 racks of them which was enough to feed 3 to 4 people the sides were way to small... :( The sides were definitely not enough for 4 people lol... *The service for the to go orders was great! He was very nice and very fast. Great customer service I received!"}, {"review_id": "4jPxZPGs7E3jNQhcJujjtA", "user_id": "e6heoqu1EnKkaNFbf1N7CQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2017", "text": "I don't come to the South often, only for work really. But there is one thing I know - you gotta have the BBQ and some sweet tea. Stumbled upon here on a weekday for a late lunch right before my flight back home to the Northeast. I was browsing through Yelp and saw rave reviews on this place and then highlights were on the Beef Brisket so that is exactly what I ordered (since I knew this was going to be my lunch & dinner) and I have no regrets! I definitely ate too much in one sitting but it was SO worth it.The Bacon Wrapped Jalapenos appetizer was really good as well - I mean c'mon you can never go wrong with bacon in anything and I thought the jalapenos added a nice kick. The large Beef Brisket meal came with 2 sides so I went all out and ordered the Mac & Cheese, Baked Beans and Hush Puppies. If you do order the Beef Brisket option, you can choose whether you want lean, fatty or combo meat. I chose the combo and all pieces were extremely tender, juicy and smoked to perfection :)The prices were very reasonable for the amount of delicious food you get. The service was excellent - the food came out quick and our server was very attentive. They also have outdoor seating and good beers on taps. Highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "81eKN30wVMI7qAHYAKqIzQ", "user_id": "PNe1cLSLJiDOT3_ivV3XVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "This is simply the best BBQ I've ever had.

The food's as good as my mother's cooking, if she cooked BBQ food! This was my first time trying out BBQ in Columbia and I wasn't disappointed! The food and service were exceptional!To set the mood, they have some tables outside in the patio for outdoor seating. Inside, they have a line of booths on the left and right side of the restaurant and tables in the middle and lining the window if you like to people watch. They really went a homey Southern BBQ kinda environment. They have pictures of farmers, old black and white pictures, pig decorations, and BBQ signs. There's also TVs in the middle of the restaurant and along the bar if you want to watch a game. The Food: I ordered their special of the day, the house beef hamburger topped with cheese, cole slaw, and fried pickles that comes with one side, which I chose the sweet potato fries. My friend ordered the Burnt Ends which is their infamous crispy caramelized beef brisket braised in their own special barbeque sauce that comes with 2 sides, which she picked mac and cheese and hush puppies. Y'all, I ended up liking my friend's food more than mine! The brisket is on point and is full of rich flavor and it was like a party in my mouth where I tasted every molecule of the deliciousness. Her sides were okay, but didn't taste special or above average. I liked my burger and the cole slaw and fried pickles toppings meshed together well. My sweet potato fries were alright, but I wish they came out more crispy and tender.The Service: Exceptional! It was our first time here, so our waitress Maddie recommended the food that we ended up ordering and loving. The food came out quickly and I appreciated her checking up on us a lot and the manager coming up to introduce herself and say hey. The busboy was also really efficient at clearing our dishes as soon as we were done. Overall, y'all should give this place a try! You won't be disappointed! This is a good place to bring friends and family to get your fixin' for good Southern BBQ."}, {"review_id": "m6EOHWbXEJeUaVWBF5gcsA", "user_id": "F6XdIQt1bJDuqnWDFY7sEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Fantastic BBQ everytime we stop.
