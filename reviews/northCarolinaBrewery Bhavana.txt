I absolutely love dimsum and it's been tough trying to find a restaurant that serves it and it actually tasting good. The restaurant is definitely fusion and you wouldn't be able to find some of the signature dimsum dishes but what they do have is absolutely incredible in itself. To top things off, this restaurant is part restaurant, part garden, part bookstore, part brewery which just makes it that much cooler and enjoyable- especially if you have a lot wait. We got here fifteen minutes after opening and the place was PACKED and we still had to wait an hour before we could be seated- crazy! But we were able to entertain ourselves perusing through the books provided and admiring the beautiful floral arrangements. Now to the food. I've been dreaming about Peking Duck ($45) so that was an absolute must. I will say, it wasn't AS good as I thought it was going to be (I grew up in NY, I'm a food snob, got it) but it was still good enough that we cleaned the entire plate even after having two appetizers. The dish comes with little baos for you to make duck sammiches with, cucumbers and green onions, hoison sauce, and obviously the duck. There is a good amount of meat there too- two legs, breast meat, and two wings. The best part of the duck was the skin- sooooo crunchy. It definitely added to the overall sammich in bringing the crunch factor. The seafood dumplings was good but I'm not sure it's worth raving about. The mushroom sauce was tasty though I wish there were more mushrooms in the sauce. The dumplings itself were good (again, not delicious) and the seafood inside tasted fresh. Four for 13$ seems a bit absurd. The scallion pancakes with bone marrow. Wow. WOW. Best dish of the night hands down. The presentation in itself was beautiful- semi circles of scallion pancakes and a large piece of bone marrow with some sort of delicious oxtail meat concoction on top. Combine the pancakes with the oxtail and the bone marrow and the delicious home made soy sauce vinegar chili sauce and you have a bite of heaven. SO DELICIOUS. The hour long wait was absolutely worth every second even if solely for the scallion pancakes alone!"}, {"review_id": "uxbwQKuh9Ggb9t38Cf6lmQ", "user_id": "qb4l3B1VifNbkGkC61emSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Florist, Brewery and Dim Sum, there's no denying this is a unique combination for a restaurant and boy is this place unique in all the right ways. I'm gonna breakdown my review here because this place is a lot of amazing! Atmosphere: Trendy, unique, intimate and fun - yes, all of it. How they do it I don't know but it works great. The brewery flower/book shop and restaurant all blend in with each other so you could be eating in the bookshop, neat the brewery bar, or in the dedicated restaurant portion. They all offer their own vibes which I found very refreshing because each place you sit is a different experience. You can't go wrong with any of them thoughBrewery: EXTENSIVE selection of very unique beers that are inspired by places from around the world. There's even one from the owners travels to Kerala, India (my home state!) so yes I naturally got that and it had a very interesting flavor profile. There were so many I wanted to try so definitely doing back for more. Restaurant: The food here makes a solid run at the best cuisine you can get in the RTP area, no joke, and it probably succeeds in certain cases. Dim Sum (small plates) are the way to go here to try all the fantastic foods they have here. Highly, highly recommend the Chicken Curry Boa, it tasted like my mom's chicken curry, and that's traditional indian food, not something you're supposed to find in a restaurant so I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied. The Crab Rangoon, Vegetable Curry Puff (Amazing), Edamame Dumplings and vegetable rolls were all fantastic as well. The ribs, not so much. Prepare to have your taste buds taken to the far reaches of the world, all these dishes pack a punch!PS. Reservations, yea, super hard to come by. Like I'm talking 2-3 months out sometimes. My recommendation is go in on a Sunday and put your name down, if you go around 6 like I did the wait's only about 30 minutes and you have a brewery conveniently located on site. How nice right?"}, {"review_id": "ThFUkFk9_C5z2pJA7B9GLQ", "user_id": "6n2XkPCczkRRbiMfXiIa2A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "2nd visit: We dropped off a book yesterday And were greeted by a less than friendly hostess, she blew it off when we mentioned there were at least six tables empty (they remained empty while we checked out the bookstore & library too).

Upon walking in, you're greeted by the hostess stand.  Immediately behind them is the book and flower shop, with some restaurant seating.  To the right is the restaurant area.  To the left is the bar, which if you're going to the bar, you can just head that way.  They also sell their bottles of beer in the flower and book shop area. Their beer is incredible, but if beer is not your thing, they also have a great selection of wine and mixed liquor drinks.  I usually grab a glass of wine there.   If you're looking for a wine not on the menu, ask for what Jordan is drinking, you won't be upset.  (Jordan is the bar manager for Bida Manda and Brewery Bhavana.)Back to the eating portion of the visit... I got there about 15 minus early, so I could grab a drink at the bar.  I gave them my cell phone number so they could text me when the table is ready, which I appreciate.  Our table was ready on time, which I also appreciate.  We were seated at a small table next to the bar area.  It was a bit on the smaller side, so I was somewhat concerned all of the food would fit on our table (which was not an issue).  I've heard to go with the small plates, so being the first time eating here, that's what I went with. With being 2 of us eating, we asked the waitress how many small plates are typical for a meal.  She recommended 3 small plates for 2 people.  We decided to go with 3-4 depending on how full we got, and to order as we went.  We started with the Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings, the chicken curry bao, and the vegetable curry puffs.  All were amazing and full of flavor.  The absolute favorite of the round was the soup dumplings, they're a must.  The second favorite differed between me and my friend.   I preferred the vegetable puffs, and my friend preferred the chicken curry.  The chicken curry was a little bit spicier (heat wise) and the vegetable puffs had incredible flavor.   We ended up deciding to do five due to indecision, so the next round consisted of the edamame and ginger dumpling and the seafood dumplings.  The edamame and ginger dumplings are a good palate cleanser.  Both were good, but all in all I'll be going back for the first 3 items (Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings, chicken curry bao, and vegetable curry puffs).  We were a bit stuffed after 5 small plates, so we didn't end up getting dessert.  As a side note, I've heard comparisons between Bida Manda and Brewery Bhavana.  Personally I think they're different types and shouldn't be compared.  Both are good, but are a bit different.  I will definitely be eating here again and always getting the Xiao long bao."}, {"review_id": "bdVajGJTuRCFNx79KXdYlw", "user_id": "Lv6oo-Szc3KQUafQtemXmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Brewery Bhavana is a beautiful restaurant. The space is huge, with a bar to the left and more cozy dining tables to the right; the center section is more retail space. You walk in and are immediately swept up in the high ceilings, amazing natural light, flowy curtain dividers, books everywhere (both for sale and for in-seat browsing), and floral displays. I was immediately drawn to some trendy, gorgeous interior design books, and I enjoyed looking through them while we waited for our table to be ready. We sat down and got cute menus from our server. The menu (both for drinks and food) had introductions and tables of contents. I appreciated reading a bit about the owners and their story before investigating the food options. We asked the server how many plates would be appropriate for two people. He said he recommended the small plates, since that's where their menu highlights were. We picked the scallion pancakes, the corn and shrimp pies, the seafood dumplings, and the crab fried rice (the one thing from the large plate menu). This was plenty of food for the two of us.The food came without too much wait, and it was good. I especially liked the corn and shrimp pies. We didn't get our water refilled for our whole mean, and my husband actually got up, walked across the huge room, took a water bottle off a table, and brought it back to our table and no workers seemed to notice. One thing I didn't love was the noisiness of the restaurant. The high ceilings and industrial vibe was breezy and attractive but made it so loud. Don't go here if you're trying to have a conversation with your companion, or even if you want to hear what the server has to say. There was music playing but all I could hear was thumping base. If you're interested in visiting a trendy hot spot with a cool vibe, check this place out."}, {"review_id": "7pDptuo-wrjHM8o-nLwx2A", "user_id": "zs7P3o9stNXPc8723alvHg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "I have been hoping to come here for a long time.

I don't go to Raleigh often, but I love the concept of Brewery Bhavana and I wish I discovered it earlier. I love how it's a huge space that's a restaurant with very pretty decorations and tables. But it's also a book store, flower store, and has a large bar! They take large reservations, so I went with a lot of friends on a Saturday. It was the perfect mid-day meal!I love dim sum and I haven't found a great place in NC, but Brewery gets pretty close. It's not typically authentic dim sum, but it's authentic dim sum dishes with a twist. There's a really nice mix of diverse foods on the menu, so basically anyone should be able to find something they like to eat. I also like how extensive their drink menu is. For lunch, I ordered the crab rangoon, turnip cakes, and the pork belly rice cakes. I shared my appetizers with someone else, but overall, it was a TON of food. The rice cakes dish was really good (spicy) and a very large portion. It's the first time I've had pretty authentic rice cakes in the south, so I would definitely recommend them! The crab rangoon were also really good because you could actually taste the fresh crab in the middle. The turnip cakes also tasted extremely authentic. The one warning about the turnip cakes is that they did not look how turnip cakes typically look (a little browner than usual), but they still tasted extremely good! Finally, I have to give a major shoutout to the service. For a large group of 14-15 people, we had amazing service. Our waitress did her job seamlessly. We really appreciated how she took our orders quickly, was always around to fill waters, and knew exactly what she was doing.
