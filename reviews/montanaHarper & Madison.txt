I've been waiting for this place for years! (In all fairness, there's one other place downtown, whose name I'm forgetting right now, so make that 2 'totally cute coffee houses in Billings, but I digress...) (And I'm only in town 4-6 times a year, and then mostly with family, so I don't get out much).They're totally nice and friendly and though they don't have a lot of veggie options on their menu, they offered to substitute meat with avocado so that was extra cool. They also have a killer dessert selection, so triple plus there as well. I could probably camp out all day here and write reviews of other worthy places in Billings, but the list isn't that long."}, {"review_id": "bVvDNxHrR9ogtosjEYR73w", "user_id": "KL9Nd7F1C_avfKbHD-7izg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Came in for a brunch during the week and we ordered the breakfast tacos. The tacos were kinda bland and the tortillas were on the stale side. The portion size was pretty small for the price and some sides would've been betterOn the other end I ordered the bread pudding and it was a big slice and it was delicious.

We both ordered omelets which were delicious and contained abundant ingredients. They came with potatoes that were well-seasoned and not too salty. They have since changed the way customers get coffee. People are now given coffee by the cashier instead of pouring themselves from a station. This is wonderful except if the servers get busy you can't get a refill at your table :( They are improving and getting there!"}, {"review_id": "8AQrvannPHzLsK1Vcp32DA", "user_id": "nDfcOXyFdlPaxepq-80xmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Made it a point to go to this restaurant while visiting town and it was worth the effort! The interior is so cute, well decorated and incredibly clean. The staff is beyond friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and accommodating. You can tell they really care about what they do. The food was exquisite! I believe the soup changes daily. My dad and I wanted to split a sandwich and get a cup of soup each. The staff made that very possible! They even put each of our sandwich halves on their own plate. We felt very welcomed and valued as customers. Next time I come back, I plan to visit again, without a doubt!"}, {"review_id": "A669cFlJB1urqwZN-jpLdQ", "user_id": "vFpxtFJFKNZmE1mr_pYUeg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "No service no direction unless you know the secret system don't go  they don't need my business"}, {"review_id": "ympWqmEShON5iitf4qWy2Q", "user_id": "Vf1Gdk2gVCP9xZrLTD9Y0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "I came for lunch, what a nice place and atmosphere!! We discussed several options, where I learned the bulk of there stuff was all homemade from scratch!! My kind of place!!! So I went with the Ruben (So Yummy!!) and also had one of their amazing looking chocolate chip cookies. (Outstanding!!). There are lots of other great things I need to come back and try!!

It's sort of a random place to find a restaurant, and when I was driving there using Google Maps, I thought the app was steering me wrong until I saw the storefront.I came during lunch, and the place was pretty packed. You need to order at the CPU yet and then take a number to a table where a server will bring your order. Seating was limited, but thankfully I was able to find an empty seat at one of the larger tables. I ordered a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty tasty. Not close to anything you'd find in NY or other east coast cities, but not bad. All in all, a pretty solid place local place in Billings to grab a sandwich or salad for lunch."}, {"review_id": "0b2YekdlW9ikmeeHiKhS1g", "user_id": "g8EIF_G9DDcGbND6BjxD7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "We were desperate for a good breakfast and Yelp came through for us again.  Nice atmosphere.  Solid breakfast biscuit sandwich.

It has a generous patio area on a large sidewalk. Clearly a neighborhood favorite. Families with their dogs, bike parking - great vibe. Delish egg breakfast options, larger number of lunch items.

I travel to Montana for business (and soon to explore nature) and I wanted to explore what the local food and venues have to offer. If you want breakfast and a great coffee, you need to stop by here. It's become my exclusive spot in the mornings, and it is incredible. Their pastries and food items are all made right there in house from scratch and they are all wonderful. You need to try the caramel roll, but their daily danishes are insanely good!Coffee is definitely tasty, well made and good beans. And I have to say, the service is wonderful! They make you feel at home, everyone is incredibly friendly and helpful and it is so genuine to experience that kind of care and service in any sort of establishment.

While not exactly cheap eats, this place has quality food that is delicious! I had the breakfast tacos on one occasion and the chicken squash salad on another. The breakfast tacos were super flavorful and at $9 for two tacos they were still worth it. The chicken squash salad was amazing with really well seasoned chicken and fresh beautiful greens. Harper and Madison has great coffee as well, and I did eat a fruit tart that was incredible (and I'm not a big dessert person). It's hard to find quality food like this in Billings, and they have a great ambiance as well. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the decor is laid back but very neat.
