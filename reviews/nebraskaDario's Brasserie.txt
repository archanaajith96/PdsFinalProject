While I am not sure what my favorite burger is in Omaha, this one was up there. We ordered the Brasserie burger and Dario's cheeseburger. Both came with fries and both were cooked perfectly to medium. I enjoyed both burgers very much (for different reasons). The Brasserie burger had a short rib mixture to it and I liked the beef more than the cheeseburger. The cheeseburger was more your typical burger toppings- onion, lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes, with a thousand island like sauce. Both burgers were cooked very well and the meat was juicy and delicious. Overall, I enjoyed Dario's and I would return for the burgers. These are more high end burgers ($15ish) and I would like to come back for some of the other stuff."}, {"review_id": "TpseK8_VMWazojvppYFhhw", "user_id": "k0m5nvgAIIA24t_iPZOAsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "This place is pretty much a slam dunk. Charcuterie Boards here are a celestial experience. Pair that up with some monastery made beer from Belgium or France and you have the makings of a great evening. Dinner/entree salads are a fine pairing with the board. All and all, just a great place to eat. I look forward to returning for a legitimate entree... and more beer!"}, {"review_id": "PHt-5X9Bsj38HGVNjpec6g", "user_id": "FlEbL_nsiGzaK620Sv6zsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "This was my 2nd time at Dario's and my S/O 1st visit.

The fries were light and crispy (just how they should be) and the boar pasta was deliciously comforting. Nothing like homemade pasta and a game meat ragù."}, {"review_id": "IBU4k-br_BcSMsUnJLgDdg", "user_id": "E8ZVr_IpmBe8EifW7qNPzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "It has been almost a year since my last visit to Dario's Brasserie, so on my birthday, I decided it was time to go again and see if it was still as good as I thought it was the first time I was there.When we arrived, we were seated immediately by a friendly hostess.  Emilio our server, quickly came to our table to introduce himself and take our drink orders, He as very pleasant. When he returned with our drinks he asked if we had any questions about the menu and answered them all.  He also went over all the specials that they were offering.  After we ordered I asked him for his recommendation for a wine and he recommended a couple and we chose Dom des Hates Chablis and it turned out to be perfect.   (I'm 73 and I'm used to ordering wine base on Region, Vineyard and distributor, today that doesn't mean very much in restaurants so you have to rely on your server.)For an appetizer, we had their special for the day which was a Bosnian dish call Cevapcici.  It is a mixed meat skinless sausage with onions served on flat bread.  It has sour cream with chives and minced red peppers on the side.  This was the first time I ever had this item and it was delicious.  I think that if you add eggs, it would make a unique breakfast meal.For anyone that follows my reviews, you know that in restaurants of this caliber, the soup, must be a French Onion.  They call their's French Onion Gratinee.  Now I would have liked a little more onion in my soup, but on the other hand Lois thought hers was perfect, that is strictly a personal preference.  The flavor and the ratio of bread, cheese and soup was spot on. For the main course Lois had the Chicken Confit which consisted of a crispy leg & thigh, piperade, Yukon potato, and a salad of cucumber and arugula.  I was told that it was simple but delicious.  I had Grilled Leg of Lamb which had triple cooked potatoes, peas a la flamande, raisin relish, jus.  I'm used to having lamb at Greek restaurants and this was nothing like that, this was more like a prime steak.  I was truly blown out of my socks, to where I even asked the waiter If the was a mistake, but he assured me there was no mistake.  When I got home I found they don't have a steak on their menu.  I have a whole new appreciation of lamb now.For desert Lois had the Chocolate Mousse with almond Florentine and raspberries.  I had their Cream Brulee with a candied lemon peel and mixed berries.  Both deserts follow the standard of the rest of the meals, prepared to perfection and were delicious.In ending, Dario's Brasserie, is everything that I thought it was a year ago and should rank as one of Omaha best restaurants.  You will enjoy your dining experience from both an emotional and food point of view.  If there was one suggestion that I could give them to enhance the experience, it would be to give new silverware with each course, and if that is the only criticism I can come up with, I'll let you decide how good this restaurant really is."}, {"review_id": "fp9ofF7C9fNMrjLiynW0PA", "user_id": "p1nQdgzvp6_SGPrPpQUEVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "Wonderful service. My husband and I had our \"rehearsal dinner\" here last September, and they handled our crowd of over 20 diners quite well. They have a candlelit private room in the back and the process of getting someone on the phone, getting all my questions answered and reserving the room was very smooth. I appreciated that they did not charge a room fee, as did some of the other places I called. They did require a minimum of $500 on the bill, but that was more than easy to do with 20 people. The atmosphere was classy but not stuffy. Dario's also had a nice selection of wine and beer. Our waiters and waitresses were also attentive. Everyone seemed to like their dishes, which were nicely presented. I really enjoyed my steak salad and the cauliflower soup was amazing. I look forward to coming back again."}, {"review_id": "-2tDptUigEtjovB--W1qJA", "user_id": "3c1fHIpLsZ0vsKIvani8Fw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/28/2017", "text": "I don't know how I've managed to live here for 2 years and to not have made it until yesterday into Dario's Brasserie. The place is a little piece of heaven. Particularly if you are into Belgian beers in any manner, you must absolutely make your way here. Their Belgian list is outstanding, and could stand up to a Belgian specialty beer location in any major city in this country. The food is divine. I had the steak frites and the only downside is that I think I could eat about 45 lb of the stuff. And just to be clear, it does not come in a 45 lb portion. The weather was perfect, the patio was just right with some beautiful oblique lighting Illuminating the seating area. The interior is very European Continental in its feel, if I had to sit in there I would be just as chuffed.Dario, thank you for coming to the United States. Thank you for coming to Omaha. And thank you for creating This brilliant little gem. I can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "gHNPXdP9sjLte_MVznTr8Q", "user_id": "tIa3EePuC3JJGgLwSTF0fQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "5 star all the way. The food is delicious.

It's experiences like this one that motivates me to constantly try new places and new dishes. I came here for restraunt week. The wagyu tartare was beautiful, simple and yet delicious. The bouillabaisse was perfection. I'm usually not a fan of a pure tomato flavor, but somehow it was bright with the lightest hit of citrus and a perfect compliment to the striped bass. And the cookie butter crepe was out of this world. I ordered it by chance, as it was the most adventurous option but truth be told I wasn't expecting much from a crepe... I've never been a big fan of French restaurants or French food because they always seem to fail to deliver. Fortunately Darios delivers and then some."}, {"review_id": "veZpvLmIn0fSYMjDUFGffA", "user_id": "58L4aDYuyKd67ooGEzch8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2017", "text": "Had a tasty dinner here on Saturday night.

The food is phenomenal, the atmosphere can be casual or romantic, staffs are professional, and the beer list is just fantastic. My boyfriend ordered the Beer Flight which came in 4 types of beer that you could try and he enjoyed them very much!I tried the Short Ribs, Smoked Salmon Belly Crepes, Moules Platter, and Moules Provencal. All the dishes have never let me down.*Always check for Soup of the Day, typical their soups are delicious.Short Ribs-definitely recommend because of how delicate this dish is. Short Ribs is moist and tender with puree and saute vegetables. Take a bite of each and experience the flavor.Smoked Salmon Belly Crepe-savoury crepe with a generous portion of salmon goes along well with the pickled beet (I was skeptical about this too). I ate one crepe and it gets me full. Moules Platter-the melting gooey cheese on mussels is heaven, nothing to complaint about this. Moules Provencal-a different version for mussels, this time it steamed with tomato, thyme, oregano. This created the sea-flavor I would say, you can taste the mussels and their sweetness. Always my favorite appetizer. The staffs are very knowledgeable about the menu, from the food to drink and offer many recommendations. A fancy dining experience for an affordable price."}, {"review_id": "dZ5NSwod4_H7iBOpSRBu3Q", "user_id": "P5lxGsRr8cdWFv1rlykoOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Wonderful.

I've only heard good things about Dario's and now I only have good things to say about it too!Food 5/5- We ordered the Fromage, Pork Rillettes, Demi Cote du Porc, Roasted Chicken, Chocolate Mousse and Street Vendor Crepe. Ahh where to start? The fromage plate was very good and I didn't expect to like the pork rillette since the waiter compared it to pâté (and I've never had a good experience with pâté) but it was very good. Both entrees were amazing. The flavors for each were very different, but both individually very pleasing. I was shocked by the tenderness of the pork and chicken. Then the dessert came and of course it exceeded my expectations. Both desserts were very satisfying to eat, yet were not too rich or heavy. Service 4/5- We did not have to wait for anything but we did feel that it seemed a little rushed considering the restaurant was not very crowded.Price 5/5- Due to the fact that we got such a great deal during Restaurant Week for the excellent quality of food that we received.Like I said earlier, I only have good things to say about this place! The food was so good that I am willing to return and pay the regular price for the same entrees, although first I would definitely try one of the many other appealing entrees on the menu such as the savory Crepes, Croque Madame, or short ribs."}, {"review_id": "f6C_Zl3nZiQXCFJwTRqOqg", "user_id": "_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/17/2017", "text": "The Fiance and I were really looking forward to our NYE dinner here at Dario's. From the mouthwatering sound of their regular menu items to the dynamic reviews from fellow yelpers, we thought we were sure to have bellies so full we might not even be awake for the new year (preferable way to ring in the new year). Sadly the best way to sum this visit up is simply underwhelming. We called a few days ahead and made reservations. We were seated right away which was great cause there isn't a lot of standing room in the doorway. Not to mention the funny thing about doors is that they open frequently and December in Nebraska was on the other side of it. I felt a little bad for those who had tables right near the door as even I could feel the chill in the middle of the dining room. The dining room itself is small and tables are close together. We were right in the middle and definitely felt a lot of hustle and bustle around us. Not as intimate as an atmosphere as we were searching for. The inside is very pretty though with a gorgeous eclectic look. Our server took about 30 mins or so to get to us for our drink order and then about another 20 to get our order. We were pretty much ready to start chewing on napkins; which, i would guess, are probably gluten free. Speaking of gf they are gluten aware at this restaurant and there were things on the menu that were gf. Our server just wasnt sure what they were. After checking with the kitchen it was decided I could have the shrimp bisque and the two steak entrees. They had a limited NYE menu and the variety was lacking. They had fries on a couple of the entrees and then again as one of the appetizers, and two of the entrees were lower quality sirloin or flat iron steak options. When our server did bring our food though he hesitated and had to double check that the sauce was gluten free. Luckily mine was, but my Fiance's (the other option they'd given me) actually wasn't. So their accuracy on gf reporting may be a little off.  I went with the shrimp bisque and the Boeuf Bourguignon (the sliced flat iron with red wine reduction) and the Fiance went with the wagyu sirloin. The soup came and it was awesome. Super incredibly flavorful and silky smooth texture with little shrimp bites of happiness. We had to ask for bread several times as my Fiance was just watching me eat and his crankiness status was increasing. We overheard the customers next to us put in a complaint about their sirloin and how chewy and difficult it was to eat. The person finally placed his cutlery on his plate and gave up eating..made us a bit nervous. Unfortunately when our food arrived it was not as awesome as the bisque. Sirloin was in fact very chewy and tenacious. Flavors were not on point and side of fries were unexciting. My bourguignon was not at all what it suggested. There were no slices, the texture was that of lunch meat. Incredibly paper thin ribbons and overcooked. It was..challenging to get down to say the least. I was not surprised to see many other tables next to us left their steak dishes untouched. The burger entree seemed to be the only popular one. Price was well over 100 for one soup, two entrees, and one drink. It's really too bad because it sounds like their regular menu gets really stellar reviews; however, their NYE menu selection and execution put a damper on our NYE spirits. The Fiance phrased it best, he said it was pretentious without substance. I have to agree."}, {"review_id": "lh4l0KWlNSwu-9JugM5xMQ", "user_id": "yn7IhwwuFFt9T9D2Vqss6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Stopped here on our drive down from North Dakota to visit family in Missouri.

The place was packed, so I'm really glad we made reservations. We sat right in front of the door but it didn't matter because the place was very warm. Our server, Jenna, was fantastic. We had such a hard time ordering because we were getting caught up in conversation. She was extremely patient and kept complementing us on how we took our time and really enjoyed the meal. She told us how so many people rush with they eat but, this food should be enjoyed. She also refilled our waters often so we could enjoy chatting. For an appetizer, we ordered muscles with white cheddar. They are really good but definitely rich. Bread also comes for you to snack on while you wait but I would rather order the muscles instead and forgo the free bread n butter (shocking, right?!). For my main entrée, I ordered the salmon. It was amazing. The creamy sauce and caramelized onions were superb. My date ordered pheasant and oh my word... I was really amazed by how delicious it was. I am so happy he shared a bite with me. The apple pie was recommended for dessert but, because I am allergic, my date didn't want to risk it. We settled for the house crêpe with vanilla gelato. I was very underwhelmed with it. It made my stomach kind of have acid reflux, too, which means they either use syrup to flavor it or it is too sugary.Other than dessert, I loved the food in the restaurant. The restaurant itself is very eclectic, the staff is amazing, the Dundee area is great for walking around, and overall was a pretty nice dinner date.(Sorry about the no photos for this review. I didn't want to freak my date out by snapping pics of everything we ate on our first date, lol.)"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/darios-brasserie-omaha?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
