We came unknowingly on their Taco Tuesday with the deals of $3 tacos, and $5 margaritas! Unfortunately for how busy they were it definitely compromised our service :/ I'm a patient person and can engage in conversation to pass the time, but waiting for our first greet took us flagging down a member of the staff to please assist us.The drinks were awesome! We got a classic frozen margarita and the 64 oz Captain Ridiculous's Rum de Dum Dum!As for the tacos, they were amazing! At our table we each got different tacos and had nothing but good things to say about them! Pretty much any taco on their menu will be a win!Over all, I would go back for sure, but probably not on taco Tuesday unless you have the large amount of time to spare, and I would keep ordering each taco until I've had them all!"}, {"review_id": "TPb1poRQtFB_a81kp4VAbw", "user_id": "WwmWdDCJREohcxQqfnOL-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Great food and excellent service! My partner has been here several times but this was my first time visiting. Came on a quiet weeknight and didn't have to wait for a table. We ordered well: the rum house salad (small was plenty) to share and the 4 taco plate which came with plantains, beef patty and a choice of side (we got sweet potato waffle fries). Plenty of food for two. Slightly disappointed that we only got two pieces of friend plantain but it's a minor complaint. We tried a variety of tacos including the calypso beef, Drewbrees, jerk chicken and brisket. Everything was yummy and reasonably priced. Will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "xTGHYCevxMiHpyqMxzNm_A", "user_id": "6NBJprU8lxCbiR8Y0wp-Vw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Before visiting The Rum House in Baton Rouge, I had been to the New Orleans location on a number of occasions.  To be honest, I enjoy that location more because of the atmosphere, but the Baton Rouge location is certainly a good option.  If you are looking for a large bar, the definitely offer it.  However, if you want to eat in a quiet restaurant, this may not be the spot.  It can get very busy.  The food is good, and there are a lot of options.  There is a large variety of tacos, and they have excellent sides.  I've also enjoyed the cuban sandwich."}, {"review_id": "ZAfU_2nGAK8GmoMN5Jhf3g", "user_id": "wloUNDrG2FvjHB-dTtUn9g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I travel to Baton Rouge for work every so often and the Rum House is consistently a go-to spot for me.

The back bar manager however \"Loau\" was a very dry and rude personality. One of my party was laughing and joking, asking to buy our bartender a shot. He said that he wasn't allowed. Well my party member asked her\"Loau?\" if it was allowed... she replied simply with a \"resting bitch face\" \"No.. if he does... he's fired!\" I understand rules.. there is however tact!

Baton Rouge was utterly deserted. Eating at the Rum House completely made up for this.I cannot eat gluten and my server, Chance, was knowledgeable about gluten free because he told me his mother can't eat it as well.I had the Key-Lime coconut rum punch which I can tell you tastes like a slice of key lime pie. It is now my favorite drink EVER!I ordered the Shrimp Rundown dish with coconut mango rice. Honestly, I can tell you I've never eaten anything SO delicious in my life. This place should have a line out the door every night.If I could eat here every night of my life...I probably would. This was my favorite dining out experience ever.Hidden gem. Eat here. yes!"}, {"review_id": "P3eXIaw2rMCOE_kPf_uEig", "user_id": "WPZNvd8BGbxRoQLWGEPz1g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "Quality: 4 | Value: 2.5 | Environment: 4 | Service: 5Overall: Great drinks but mediocre & overpriced food. Probably better for a happy hour/drinks only vibe.Positives: Our waitress was great! She was sweet, polite, & attentive. She was able to answer questions about the menu with confidence. We went on a Friday night about 9p & it wasn't too crowded at all. The atmosphere was pretty relaxed. A few games on but not loud at all. Clean & Comfortable! The food came very quick which was nice BUT that may be a reason for some of the negatives. The only taco we enjoyed was the chili glaze shrimp taco. The shrimp was large & the sauce was more sweet than spicy but still delicious. The drinks were GOOD! I had a frozen margarita which I enjoyed! The sides (the rice & mac & cheese) to our entrees were the best thing about the meal next to drinks. Negatives: OVERPRICED FOR THE PORTIONS!!! $15 for three baby tacos & 1 small scoop of a side. && LAWD don't get me started about the taste. I didn't enjoy any of them!! Even the one with queso (chopped shrimp) was mediocre. Anything with queso should be drop dead delicious!! The fried oyster taco was also really mushy, like it was old or something. I only ate them so I didn't waste the $15. My friend only enjoyed 1 of his tacos. So out of 6 different tacos amongst the two of us only one of them was good. They need to adjust their prices or increase the portions. Either I won't be back unless it's happy hour. I can find better ways to spend 30$ on food & 20$ on drinks."}, {"review_id": "a8SIoZTWkSHZMrs1nlJONA", "user_id": "9Qw7PWYwDSL3d2G4-sJ-Sw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "This one has better decor than New Orleans but that's about all.

It isn't perfect and they aren't always consistent, but we know what we like here and it makes it a solid choice for lunch or dinner in Baton Rouge. Just know the parking absolutely stinks in the Palms complex where it is located, but it doesn't usually stop us from eating here. Food: My husband and I's favorite menu item is the damn good nachos app, and now they offer it in two sizes (small & large) so we typically split the small and add a side of greens or a small salad--that's our go-to meal here. The tacos are pretty good but I find them to be somewhat overpriced and not always consistently executed. Also the rum house salad is awesome! For the sides, you can't go wrong with the plantains, the jalapeno coleslaw, cornbread dressing, sweet potato fries, or the smothered greens (well they are a little too salty on the rare occasion, but we usually get them anyway.)Drinks: They have an extensive rum list for the rum enthusiast though we usually come during happy hour and stick to that list. My husband enjoys the rum punch (a bit too sweet for me) and I stick to the mojito, margarita, or the occasional sangria. If it isn't happy hour I like caipirinha. The bartenders are somewhat inconsistent though and I've gotten a range of sweetness in the same drinks on different visits, which is a little frustrating. Atmosphere: Fun, island vibe with a good amount of indoor and outdoor seating. Its fairly loud which makes it a good spot to bring the kids along and we don't have to worry about our toddler bothering another table if she gets loud. Service: We've had good service at nearly every visit and the hostesses are always there to greet you at the door."}, {"review_id": "ILMkRGrZGdECB0m5h6by-Q", "user_id": "y3xtDHF7UFajO-H46A4XGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "This place is so cool and breezy and fun you really will feel like you're on an island! Their queso appetizer is so amazing, you will want to lick the bowl clean. My favorite drink is their pineapple mojito! It tastes so fresh and I've tried recreating it at home and I fail every time. I always order their taco trio. I usually get different ones every time and I can honestly say I've only had one that I wasn't a fan of and that is the crispy fish. Other than that they are all amazing but my personal favorite is the calypso beef.
