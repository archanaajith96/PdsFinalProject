Came here a couple weeks ago with my husband for an impromptu lunch date. It was our first visit and we can't wait to come back. Our server was the best we've had anywhere in a really long time. She walked us through the menu, made some fantastic recommendations, (HEEEEEEELLO Q ROLLS) and provided top notch service the entire time. The food was some of the best we've had (sorry my dad smokes his own meats so I can't say yours is the best...wink, wink)  ;0)  And to finish it all off, we were given a bag of warm, cinnamon/sugar coated mini donuts to enjoy for the car ride home!! This is something my dad seriously needs to consider, he does not send me home with warm mini donuts haha.All in all 5 stars from start to finish. It's a bit of a hike for us, since we are in Cave Creek but we will definitely be back!!!"}, {"review_id": "u0QEtrs7WlcQsV2DVqTpCg", "user_id": "SxA4Bn-GoUnhkCUWRwMeFg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "8 of us came for lunch on a Tuesday.

We were sadly disappointed. We visited at around 11:30am on a Sunday, shortly after opening. 1. Waitress came to take our order. I guess she thought we were not ready and walked away mid-conversation without saying she would be right back. My boyfriend was talking to her with his head int he menu. When he looked up, she was gone.2. Food was subpar. Coleslaw had no flavor (and I remember this being delicious the last time.) All I could taste were the pecans. It was nice and crunchy, not doused in dressing, but absolutely flavorless.Ribs were not falling off the bone like normal and had a weird flavor. At first we thought it was the smoke, but soon realized it tasted like burnt plastic. Maybe from the oven? Pulled pork was ok, nothing special. Cornbread was probably the best part of the meal. Kind of sad to go out and eat Sunday lunch for $40 + tip and be highly disappointed. Probably wouldn't go back, not worth the money for less than mediocre food.4/2017Delish!  Our family dined here on a Friday night. We had driven by on the freeway and wanted to check it out. The building and the decor are really fantastic. Loved all the little details for industrial touches in the restaurant. There was a bit of a wait. My husband and I grabbed a beer and sat at the front entrance, which apparently we walked in through the take-out entrance. Someone escorted us to the front and got us a beeper.We watched the machine make fresh donuts, which you get with your bill as a dessert on the way out. They were fresh, hot, and delicious. But, I'm getting ahead of myself....Dinner was superb. Truly good BBQ. We've been going to Joe's for years and wanted to try something new. I had a pulled pork sandwich, my husband ordered a meat plate (pulled pork and brisket), and my son order kids ribs. The flavor was good and we were impressed. Kids ribs were a little on the fatty side, so my son made me pick the meat off and separate the fat. We would definitely go back. It's not as casual as Joe's, where you eat at picnic tables. Definitely for a nice night out, and you will be spending $$$ more for the nice night out. We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed being out there as the weather was beautiful. Some of the seating is close to other diners. It didn't bother us, but I wouldn't want to be on a date and dining right next to strangers. With kids.  Waitress was awesome too. Was able to answer all of our questions and gave wonderful service, especially on a busy night. I think she even mentioned she was working a long, 12 hour shift. Great BBQ Beautiful restaurant Delish donuts Expect to pay a little more for a meal out"}, {"review_id": "x4DYWANx9v0sHEr07gR2fg", "user_id": "udRT2F8zX0tkh7-S4nVkig", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I really thought this place would be fantastic but didn't personally think so. We split the 3 meat platter with beef ribs, pork ribs and rotisserie chick with grilled veggies and corn and mac n cheese. The beef ribs were stringy - about 4 ounces of total meat was available for consumption. The pork ribs were okay - but I expected them to be better than just okay after reading the reviews and seeing the prices. I'm more than happy to spend the price requested for the food (or even more) however I expect it to be delicious in exchange for that. I'm not much of a chef but have enjoyed the quality of meat and flavor from homemade crockpot ribs far more than anything I had here - with the exception of the donuts at the end of the meal. The donuts are to die for. They are hot and freshly made."}, {"review_id": "iYnFzL9DVG7jZqVE5HhPmA", "user_id": "JX7mjMODvt96vQIj9ENzhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "The food here was just as good as the Bobby Q's Biltmore. Our server forgot a couple of things but it was a fairly busy time when we were there and things happen when servers are busy so that can be easily overlooked. Bobby Q ribs are consistently good as is the brisket. I'll continue to go to both locations because the food is really THAT good!!"}, {"review_id": "V60WFkmiCQbkaSojscGvCA", "user_id": "bR7j5ULN5oNEgITfnbbqNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Bobby Q has got to be one of my favorite places for BBQ in the state. I can't believe for years I was eating at Famous Dave's for so long because that place is wack compared from here. The steak to the ribs and brisket is awesome. I do recommend not ordering chicken though. I recommend getting extra white gravy it's literally the best thing ever.

Very tropical vibe. Food is good too! I'm from Florida and I must say this is some of the best Arizona bbq I've had in the 4 years I've been here. We had the hog heaven platter. We chose baby back ribs, St. Louis ribs, pulled pork, brisket, Mac and cheese, corn and potato salad...  all of it was delicious! I just had to add a bit of salt to the sides. The meats were tender and we were told they are slow cooked for 22 hours. For dessert we had the banana cream and the flavors in that dessert were heavenly! The coconut was unexpected but delicious! Service was great and I loved the decor. 2 of us split the platter. We ate all the sides, but we had a ton of leftover meat to take home."}, {"review_id": "SMsAHDVDybMdGGYUmhyIQQ", "user_id": "hnljLLxT4yvPqBW9ocNwmQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "FAN-DANG-TASTIC !!! Wow, am I glad I bookmarked this place to try during our weekend stay in the Tempe area!  This place was just terrific. Interesting ambiance, a hoping bar, a fantastic menu and absolutely TOP-NOTCH service.  We could not ask for more! We were lucky enough to have Amber S. for our server on a busy Friday night but she took the time to carefully explain Bobby's menu and how it all works and we were NOT disappointed! We ordered iced tea ($2), a Coke ($2.50) an order of Q Rolls ($12.00), the Whole Hog Heaven ($51) and one additional side ($4) so we would have an even number.  WOW OH WOW !!!!! The Q Rolls were amazing!  They were like brisket filled thick taquitos with two yummy sauces.  YUM YUM YUM !!  For the Whole Hog, we chose Baby Back and St Louis Style ribs (6 bones each), for the two meat choices - Brisket and Pulled Pork (huge amount!) and for the sides, mac n cheese, pecan cole slaw, mashed potatoes and then we added a side of ranch beans.  EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!  They also provide complimentary corn bread and butter (they are served in these interesting circular shapes) and at the end of the meal, a little bag of cinnamon and sugar donuts!  INCREDIBLE !!   We are two huge eaters with no shame but even we think this was too much food for two people.  What a happy problem to have.  The only place in So Cal we can compare this to is Famous Dave's and at Bobby Q's, you get WAY MORE for your money.  WAY MORE. We cannot wait to come back.  Thank you, Amber S for the great service !!"}, {"review_id": "2EGnNvUbhRaJXweCh7fPkQ", "user_id": "EsnRqu4Dpdd6wtpuEY_x-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "We tried Bobby Q's with the recommendation of a friend.

The service was superb and the staff were very attentive to our needs.  The managers stopped by to say \"hi\" and see how things were going, so we gave them our positive feedback.  So glad we stopped here for dinner and I'll definitely return if I'm in the area again."}, {"review_id": "bn9aMj_fVcxMWw5fRegEPg", "user_id": "VfzGbwLiXq4oeteaJWMRoQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Had a good meal here with coworkers while in town for business.
