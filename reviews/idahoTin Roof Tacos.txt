After remembering we had driven by the other evening... we decided to give Tin Roof Tacos a try. Finding a parking place at first seemed tricky, but within a minute or two, a place opened up.We could see from the window it was a hopping place! When you enter, you see the menu posted on the wall. It's not a very extensive menu which helps to limit your choices and keeps things moving. Smart idea!! You make your way to the cashier, where you place your order and pay for your meal. There was a line, but it proved to move quickly. Being our first time here, we asked the wonderful employee what was not to miss or most popular menu items. She told us the fried chicken taco and shrimp taco were their big sellers. We decided to try the shrimp taco. We also tried the pork taco and brisket taco. We ordered the chips with queso and pico. We also decided to try the sopapillas for dessert. After giving our name (they call it out to collect your order when it is ready), we moved to an area to wait for our order. We had already decided we would take it \"to go\". Had we dined in, we would have had a bit of a time finding a couple seats at the communal tables, as it was busy. Our order was prepared with perfection. We received the entire order within five minutes of ordering it! Impressive! Everyone has a specific job in the preparation of the meals... works like clockwork! We were asked if we wanted any sauces included. We chose the salsa and tomatillo. Both were very good. Once we arrived home, unpacked our meals, prepped our plate... the food was devoured almost as quick as it took to receive our order. Oops! The prices are pretty average. We felt the amount of filling in the taco was average. The toppings for each taco complimented the meat/seafood used. Let's just say, we enjoyed it. The flavors were good and we will return!"}, {"review_id": "MtormDo2f5BsNKMWg_EGbA", "user_id": "cO-YOObn5tOG1MuTr_TKpg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Tin Roof is very good. There is a nice variety of tacos and every one I've tried is quite tasty. The chips and dip are delicious as well. They also have their own house made salsa and habenero sauce that are highly recommended. So good. They have a few beers on tap as well as some bottled beer. Beer is perfect with tacos! My one complaint, hence the four stars, is they play ONLY country music. Believe me, I asked. I know it sounds picky and maybe it is. However, if you're sitting in the restaurant and forced to listen to a type of music you absolutely loathe, it really kills the ambience. Why not have more variety on music, including mixing a country song in here and there? If I go back, I'm definitely getting my order to go. Otherwise, a great place and I would easily give it five stars if not for the music."}, {"review_id": "a5rbfoGqpkE-7-tXnGXqSg", "user_id": "2SbplNPXtwl_BOiAvlxjdw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "This spot was a little disappointing (not sure I agree with the 4 and 1/2 stars).Food-I got two fish and two brisket tacos. I also got some chips and guac. The meal was very reasonably priced and you get quite a bit of food for the price. The guac was very fresh, but in my opinion, it could have used a littlw more lime juice to boost the flavor.The fish tacos had a nice sauce, but the fish was dry and didn't have much flavor. The brisket tacos came with a generous portion of brisket, but it was too salty for my taste and I couldn't finish both of them due to the saltiness. Overall, a little disappointed with this spot, but the portions were generous."}, {"review_id": "tObBeg1TWMGD4CRYti01sA", "user_id": "TS57-7W57IeMjghzkvurNw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "Great concept but could have had better execution.  All three tacos were cold.  They make the taco slowly and they sit to get cold.  All three sauces were not spicy, and the chips were fried too long.Guacamole was good.Marketing looks like Chronic tacos but here at Tin Roof they stopped short.  Marketing should educate me on tacos and why these are better.  And Mimosas?  If you decide to make tacos, and decide to have a theme, work it!!!!  Don't stop...  taco's should rock, you should make me want to eat here, and show me you're the best!!!"}, {"review_id": "yJ008lmLuEk1Jo-fXrXZcA", "user_id": "3HYf3Us7Ejt0lv8WBsoU4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "As Boise has caught on to Taco Tuesday as a wonderful weekday event, tin roof tacos are clearly a taco Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday kind of place! I have tried most of the tacos and have enjoyed them all! These tacos are packed with fresh and well marinated meat and toppings that you definitely get your money's worth compared to many other taco joints around the city! Quality over quantity is a great statement to describe the value, however quality AND quantity is more deserving! Many friends have been invited from out of town and those that live here and not one person has any qualms with what is offered, provided, and experienced! Thanks for bringing such a great concept to Boise, Tin Roof! Keep on keeping on and I am happy you're thriving to open a second location! Now, stop reading this review and order you some tacos!"}, {"review_id": "QjhKozn7Svv-kS4RXNgtSA", "user_id": "pWvOl-zPFX80NEL2YyR7rg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Shrimp and fish tacos are good!

Located on Broadway near Front St (by the hospital).It's a great place for a quick bite. I work nearby so we often opt for a couple tacos to go at lunchtime. They have an awesome variety from pulled pork, to vegetarian roasted corn tacos, and even breakfast tacos. They open at 6:30 am, and the breakfast tacos are delicious!A friend was having a birthday get together, and I was pleased to find out we were going to gather here for dinner. I usually order a few tacos off their menu. Typically I get a Baja Shrimp taco with a couple of random ones thrown in. I was a little sad to find out they were completely out of the shrimp tacos (but also-they are the best, so I wasn't all too surprised).I went for:1.The Tin Roof Taco. Pulled pork seared in achiote paste (a red spice blend paste) topped with pineapple relish and cilantro-onion mix. Quite good. Probably my second favorite next to the Baja shrimp.2.The Texican. Ground beef, lettuce, tomato, and cheddar on a flour tortilla. Solid American taco.3.The Roasted Corn. Roasted sweet corn blended with chipotle mayonnaise and queso fresco, topped with pico de gallo and cilantro. This was a pleasant surprise. I expected it to be good, just not that good.In terms of condiments, TRT has a few different salsas you can choose from to slather on top of your tacos. Your options include a red restaurant style salsa, a tomatillo salsa, and a habanero salsa. I prefer the tomatillo, but every now and again I decide to burn my taste buds with some extra heat from the habanero."}, {"review_id": "i4tYq7UVB3ZCNXKNQd_TuQ", "user_id": "jwV04Xqjw5uijUhHmV4ocQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Let me tell you these peeps know what's up over here, now although the food is not super authentic it is tasty as hell, I'm from the SF Bay area and we got amazing Mexican food, and let me say this place def stacks up fasho which surprised the hell outta me!!
