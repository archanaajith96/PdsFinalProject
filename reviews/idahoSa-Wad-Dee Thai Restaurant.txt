Avoided the wait by sitting at the bar; prompt service, good local beer. The noodles were really tasty, and the sushi was fresh. We had the \"twisted\" roll. It was unique and flavorful.The restaurant was clean, the food great, and the staff helpful.

We got yhe orange chicken which was highly recommended, and it was just plain gross. My wife tried it and spit it out. Got the beef pad thai noodles also, they were better but still not good at all. Paid over thirty bucks a d threw most of it away.

This is my go to stop for Thai in Boise/Meridian area! They have all the traditional stiff as well as some unique fun menu items that will get your tastebuds chatting! Their sushi is just ok in my opinion, but it's a huge sushi  menu and I haven't tried every roll on it. Good atmosphere and attentive staff...give this place a try if you are craving Thai!"}, {"review_id": "v3-4yTIG5npJ9i3k-geDEg", "user_id": "IXVU0w1TIPFxLDm7b6tUIg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2017", "text": "I've heard really great things and finally decided to try it out. It's a very small restaurant but very well decorated and set up to maximize the space. The menu is pretty large but not big enough where you spend half an hour reading everything... Then reading it again. We decided on the pineapple fried rice and ordered it at a 3/5 spicy. The food was really delicious but not at all spicy. It was essentially the heat of a dash of pepper. I don't know if it was done in purpose because most people can't do spicy, or if it was a mistake but I could have used a lot more heat. If there is one thing I wish they had, it would be Thai pumpkin or acorn squash. I've visited other Thai restaurants and I've always seen it on the menus and I love it.  All together though, it was really good experience."}, {"review_id": "qii8Cq4lVQvjvxx_wVJqmQ", "user_id": "rI6Tqy2WR_ks5F47yYkZUw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "I used to come here as a kiddo and I loved it. Something must have changed (probably my age) but when I went here a month or so ago the food was pricey for the taste. I did not think anything was bad but when I went to eat my leftovers I re-cooked everything because it did not have any spice (which I requested) and was very sweet. If I am every in the area I will consider trying it again but so far I have had better luck at Thai Cuisine on Overland (quite the drive if you live in Meridian though). Presentation here is excellent though!"}, {"review_id": "RVBGcS2ZKw2S1_QcsQbE7g", "user_id": "g42luSLtxfy3yB3-XPG1rw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "This place consistently gets brought up as the best place for Thai food in the area, and it's easy to see why considering that they are pretty dang good.

My only criticisms are directed at the tight dining area. As long as you don't mind sitting close to others, this place is a great experience. Enough negativity. We enjoy the yellow curry. Rich flavor and, to us, the perfect amount of heat. Every dish we have tried has been very satisfying. Portions are generous. The service is outstanding. They always have plenty of hands to tend to the typical full house. Overall a great dining experience.

Jasmine our waitress very friendly and service was spot on. We waffled over what to try this time...the red,  yellow or green curry (heat scale 1-5) Panjang Curry or maybe the garlic noodles again....truthfully all have been delicious!  The included side salad not to bad with crisp  iceberg lettuce & orange dressing.  Soon the restaurant filled up and all the delicious smells. Service still great.

Great tasting food that is prepared and displayed beautifully on your plate. I had a dish with duck and shrimp. I forget the name. My wife had the salmon. I am not a big fish eater but I tasted hers and I end up finishing what she could not. It was so delicious! It is decorated very nicely. Service is very good. One of my favorite attributes is that it is not a noisy space. It has somewhat of a finer dining feel. Not old and rundown like some smaller Idaho restaurants. Great date night place!

Never again on my dime.Ordered a panang curry - it was watery, the chicken tasted like metallic dishwater and the veggies were literally a frozen pea and carrot melange. Scooped out the chicken (I really tried to eat it - hoping the curry would cover the taste of cheap meat, but alas) and tried the curry vegetarian style before deciding it was a good time to fast.Ordered a jasmine tea to help soften my disappointment, but that too tasted like hot tap water. The alleged \"jasmine tea\" bag I was given didn't even smell faintly of jasmine. Not even of green tea.It just smelled like tea bag. Bag smell. Thinking maybe my senses were confused I asked my husband to sniff test and he confirmed. It was without the signature jasmine scent. Curious and curiouser.Two stars because husband was happy enough with his meal and because the service was and always is friendly. I know some people are just nuts for this place. I personally don't get the hype. I much prefer the curries of Thai Cuisine."}, {"review_id": "ipi4ORpRhGVjVxsfguwq1g", "user_id": "x5QdKzLyg4ceFwX8oUGptg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "My friend and I love this restaurant and come in occasionally for some yummy Thai food. Tonight, (Saturday at 6 PM) was a terrible experience of bad customer service and just poor staffing. My friend and I got sat right away. We were at a back table by the restroom. For 13 minutes, not one single employee greeted our table to take drink or food orders. We finally got up and left after watching three tables who were sat after get greeted by a server who took their drink and food orders very promptly."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sa-wad-dee-thai-restaurant-meridian?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
