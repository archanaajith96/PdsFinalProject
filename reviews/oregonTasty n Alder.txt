You can also put your name and phone number on the waitlist, and either wait in the bar area or go elsewhere to grab a drink while you're waiting. Trust me, it will be worth the wait!Bar is first come, first serve. We ended up just enjoying our meal at the bar, and canceling the wait for a table. The bartender did an outstanding job staying attentive to our needs, while also making all the drinks for the restaurant! (applaud)The food was perfection!!! We started off by getting the wagyu.It was the BEST THING I PUT IN MY MOUTH! They bring a hot stone plank out, and cook your two small pieces of wagyu beef! Thank goodness it was two pieces... or we would have fought to the death for it! Wonderful amount of buttery goodness with a hint of truffle.The corn cakes were delicious, as well as the asparagus.I can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "hMGONSmv79JTNpt932rJig", "user_id": "tgxOMt72pALx3_r2uZ92tQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Hello, brunch! The \"Alders\" are known for having reinvented (or maybe even jumpstarted) brunch in Portland, and we weren't going to leave without having tried at least one of them. We chose Tasty n Alder by taking a peek at the menu ahead of time. It's a decision that can't go wrong, especially if you can't decide what type of food you want. While you may come for dinner, I highly encourage you to check it out for brunch.We wanted pretty much everything on the menu so between the two of us, we ordered three dishes. That's more than enough food, and will definitely leave you with leftovers. The portions are super generous, which makes the price tag feel a little less obnoxious. We ordered the potatas bravas, korean fried chicken, and the steak with cornmeal pancakes.I admit we could probably have skipped the potatas bravas, as there was way more than a typical tapa portion. Plus, they didn't make it taste quite like what I was craving from Barcelona. But, their steak/cornmeal pancake and korean fried chicken was pretty damn bomb. As a Korean, I was ready to negatively judge their fried chicken but they must have had a Korean chef come in with the recipe...pretty spot on. And rightly crunchy, if I may add! And their cornmeal pancake brought back lots of good childhood memories for my man.All in all, excellent food options and great execution. Will definitely add this to my Portland food choices when I'm back in town."}, {"review_id": "mU6y0raZ1-p1CjlwvZ33qQ", "user_id": "EbbOIQ5oAamS9D_B_7cC7w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This place is super famous and the lines outside are a clear indication that the word is out. I don't think the wait is worth it, but it's hard to find a place to get brunch downtown anyway without a wait. Here's some ideas to make your wait better if you're getting brunch:- Put your name in early- Walk down the street to Blue Star donuts to get a snack- Come back and have a second breakfastI thought the food was decent, but not amazing. I've had much better brunch and I would rather hit up a food truck than wait in line, but it's a nice place so I wouldn't say to avoid it completely."}, {"review_id": "d7jp4akoPqYLrTmZBagbFw", "user_id": "4_9Df3zNGvJZLGllU3k2Gw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Duck Duck Potatoes - Ordered because I saw duck fat on the menu. These tasted bland and artery clogging. Beef Bacon - Kinda strange but I'd prefer real pork bacon. One of those \"ordered for curiosity\" dishes. Steak Tartare - Had a very savory component. I'm guessing soy sauce. It was served with an assortment of vessels like butter lettuce, toasted bread, Chinese crackers, cilantro, etc. One of the best Steak tartars I've had.Apple-brined Pork Chop - Not a bad chop, not much else to say about itWagyu Skirt Steak - Skirt Steak is typically a cheap cut but the way they prepared it, it tasted like a really good NY Strip. Alder Burger - Really solid burger. Comes with lot of bacon and their awesome fries."}, {"review_id": "Wa0yB4VBBaBdrWmkyXgskw", "user_id": "QwUG9jcgBU3eDMcdKDUrzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "This is the perfect place if you want some breakfast or brunch!

If you enjoy tapas style eating this is a great brunch spot that was definitely worth the hour and half wait. The wait time increased to two hours after we put our name on the list. There is area across from the bar that is a standing area where you can order drinks and snacks while you wait if you can squeeze in and get a space. The bar seating is also first come first serve so if you don't want to wait to be seated you have options. The food is designed to be shared but if you have your eye on something delicious there isn't an obligation. The food is brought out at different times with the intention of being shared just an FYI. Everything we had was delicious. 1) NW migas- shared this with my friend. The scrambled eggs and veggies with fried tortilla chips was a great combo. 2) fried chicken on biscuit3) Korean fried chicken (loved this) - a little spice with fresh cucumbers and house made kimchi. The chicken was crispy and tasty.

I think mainly because we didn't come here for brunch, but rather dinner. Our party of 4 split the beef tartare, mushroom risotto, and the gaucho ribeye. The tartare had an Asian fusion feel to it since it came with some veggies to make wraps. The overall taste was aiite. The risotto had a nice texture and the slow-poached egg was a good addition to it. The ribeye was picked amongst the other meat dishes because my friend was a fan of chimichurri but honestly, it was just whatever. I felt like the ribeye was cooked medium, rather than the preferred medium rare, despite the red color in between the pieces. I would love to come back to check out their brunch menu but for dinner, I'll pass."}, {"review_id": "sjQn5ZDmWrRQHfY-4B0pFg", "user_id": "MCAp-_SIeoT5O-dEnhSUAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Delicious steak burger.

Time quickly passed due to great drinks and conversations. We were finally seated and we ordered the four dishes below:- Roasted Bone Marrow- Saigon Brussel Sprouts- Beef Bacon- Wagyu Skirt Steak Each dish was packed with so much flavor and I enjoyed every single bite.

We ordered the Lemmon pancake with blueberry syrup, biscuit sandwich with fried chicken and fried eggs and steak on cast iron. The steak was always my favorite and others were delicious.

On weekends, I recommend showing up before they open at 9am, because chances are, the lines have already started forming. The food here is just as the name states, tasty. It's not your typical boring brunch food, but is spiced up with a fusion of flavors. Some must have items here would be the potatoes bravas, and most definitely the Korean Fried chicken. The KFC comes with a hefty of delicious chicken, topped with a sunny side up egg, pickled cucumbers and rice. The duck duck steak is decent, but is rather small in portions, which is totally okay if you're not about a big breakfast. The quiche Lorraine is good as well, and is the best kind of quiche. It was creamy and had a hearty amount of ham.

It is my must go to place when up there and totally worth the wait. Coming on a Sunday morning this place was jam packed. We were looking at an hour wait for a party of 3. The bar is first come, first serve so if you get lucky and a space opens up, grab that seat since you can get full kitchen service.We order the usual tasty steak and cheddar cheese $19. This dish is seriously a n amazing dish full of flavor and textures. Each bite is different and that cornmeal pancake really ties in all the flavors. We also ordered:- Brussels sprouts $9: they make it perfect every time. It's one of the best I have had.- Foie gras $15: nothing special - Duck Duck egg $18: this was another really good dish. The potatoes, delicious white sauce and perfectly cooked beef was a magical meal. Every bite was delicious and I was sad when we finished it.

Upon arrival we were seated at the bar till a table became available. The decor is very west coast chic, with high ceilings an open kitchen and all around glass which invites more light into the room. The tables are situated too close to each other, hence taking away the sense of privacy.Both the host and the server were quite friendly and made recommendations on both drinks and food. We started off with a couple of rare Whiskey's that they carry and were satisfied with the quality.As for food we decided to share a couple of items to be able to give place a fair review. Steak tartar from starter menu, Ripini from the Garden menu, Mushroom risotto and Pork Belly from the main menu, and Panna Cotta from dessert menu. Steak Tartar was my favorite, with the great texture accompanied by rice crackers and a small quail egg to make it into a nice paste. Ripini was quite bitter and even the side of melted ricotta couldn't rescue it. As for mains both were tasty but failed to wow me as I had higher expectations for this place.In a city like Portland with such a diverse food scene, this spot failed to wow me and although provided good quality food didn't live up to its hype. Next time I'm in town, I'll order Whisky at the bar and head to a cozier spot for dinner."}, {"review_id": "2431J9YVOUyHGZLlGQV5yA", "user_id": "iRhaOJXVx30Oab7lxbQ85A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "This place easily became one of my favorite brunch spots in Portland. We came around 10am and got lucky finding paid street parking down the road. It looked really crowded in the restaurant but the turnover for tables was pretty quick and we were seated in 20 minutes. Staff was very friendly and patient throughout the whole service. Prices here are average, you won't break the bank for a good meal here. Everything we had was a hit and definitely a must-try for your first time here. Kentucky Peach Drink - a not too sweet cocktail with bitters to open up your tastebuds and prepare you for your meal.Toro Bravo Charcuterie Board - has a little bit of everything from cheeses to meats. Was a perfect size for our party of four. Korean Fried Chicken - this is legit! It's served in a stone pot bowl so it's still cooking when it gets to your table. This causes some of the rice at the bottom to get crispy, yummy!Duck...Duck....Steak! - A twist on steak and eggs, this was served on a skewer. I could not believe how much flavor was packed in the duck and steak, it's crazy good."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-n-alder-portland?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
