The food is great, the service perfect, but it is also just casual enough for you to relax after a day at the beach.They have a full bar and they serve sushi, which you will love.Every fish dish is amazing. Most fresh, always ask, and all great.We love the various sauces they use on fish and meat dishes.They have lovely deserts.Dress for the occasion, but you don't have to wear a suit. Business casual is great.have fun."}, {"review_id": "r8r_kVYJkjI916Hy48upDA", "user_id": "0BSZjD8FBWCc7uiOX0C08A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Nothing special to see here. This place is located about a block away from the beach in Waikiki with no view at all of the ocean. It's in a busy shopping district, which makes it convenient.  The food at was average. I got the Surf and Turf 4 course meal. It started off with a seared butterfly fish in wasabi. It was OK, too much sauce on it IMO. Next was the Caesar salad, maybe the best thing I got. Main course was 8oz filet with garlic shrimp on top of Mac n. cheese. Steak was cooked well, I though the shrimp were good, but very small and only 2. Mac n cheese was pretty good.  Chocolate soufflé for dinner, reminded me of something you can get frozen at Costco. Honestly I feel like Dominos volcano cakes are better. They also originally sat us at a table right next to pillar, which is probably the worst in restaurant. I actually felt sorry for the couple they sat there next, they guy had to sit on the side of the table to be able to eat. I ordered Makers Mark, which I would describe as a glass of ice with whiskey flavoring.Staff was nice. Ambience is OK. Two star rating primarily for value, original table ( I had to request to move), and soufflé."}, {"review_id": "AB4kYTsNTUnZM9S6uAAn0A", "user_id": "A0kENtCCoVT3m7T35zb2Vg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "We were able to get a same-day reservation. I can't address all the seating options because our mini-booth was close to the entrance so we didn't see all of the space. The resto is loud for its size.My guest had the three-course tasting menu for $53. The wine pairing is an additional $20. He started with the shrimp stick with a 3 oz Ruggeri prosecco. Next was the macadamia-nut encrusted mekajiki with 3 oz. Ohana Reserve Chardonnay. He finished with the hot chocolate soufflé with 2.5 oz. M. Chapoutier Rimage Banyuls. The wines were fine, but $20 is pricey for less than 9 oz of wine. The dishes were tasty and presented at the correct temperatures.They couldn't make a poke to suit my allergies, so I only ordered the maguro nigiri appetizer ($12). It was fine, nothing special.Our server (De André) was warm and welcoming. No fewer than three different people brought things to the table, which always throws me. Glad that I tried Roy's while in Waikiki."}, {"review_id": "1COHSnr2XS_5nmDCgiO5LQ", "user_id": "YhdVJpd5z0Bs94vAbxRK8w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Roy's made it to my list of restaurants to try while in Waikiki.First off, the service is fantastic here. I went with their four course tasting menu and the reataurant staff was well put together throughout the service. The dish selections in the menu was overall mediocre in my opinion. The only dish that comes to mind that left a good impression was the first dish. It was a seafood dish and the flavor and texture was fantastic. The rest of the dishes were enjoyable, but not something I would have selected as part of a tasting menu.I was highly disappointed with the wine selection they chose to pair with the dishes. The wine selection was not thought out, nor were they unique. They tasted like low end wine, all of which they carried on the by the glaas menu, which should have been a red flag for me.My rating is based on other fine dining establishments I have gone to in the past. Overall, the food here is good, but does not hit the marks with the fine dining restaurants. I would categorize this restaurant as an upscale Cheesecake Factory with a more focused menu."}, {"review_id": "3rUtMIyRaW8qr9vazv4VaQ", "user_id": "jh6zVf3vsjFCBcAYSdl6rQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Dined on the patio on a Friday evening, and finished the meal just as the weekly fireworks were starting at the Hilton property. If you can eat here on a Friday evening, I recommend stealing a seat outside to catch a bit of the fireworks from your seat! Two dishes stand out (I was practically moaning) : the misoyaki butterfish appetizer, with sweet ginger wasabi buerre blanc and lomi tomatoes (the star of the night), followed by Kamachi Crudo appetizer, served with Yuzu Kosho, white soy, garlic aioli, and jalapeños. Service was polite and prompt. Since we were doing a tasting menu, we were expecting a story to be presented before each dish and why a particular wine was paired with the dish. But since the atmosphere was more relaxed compared to a fine dining experience, we didn't receive this kind of experience, which was alright. Overall, a good meal at a nice location!"}, {"review_id": "uqwpJms72LOCYl2HeYVhcQ", "user_id": "5iOId572Hr76oucpP1TNCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "We were staying at the Waikiki Parc for the weekend and came here for an early dinner on Saturday night to celebrate a couple of birthdays. We couldn't have chosen a better place in Waikiki than Roy's. The food was excellent and the service was 5 star.  The sunset hour menu is the way to go if you dine here between 5-6pm. It's a prix fixe menu that comes with a poke trio, filet mignon/shrimp, and Roy's signature chocolate souffle currently priced at only $46. It's a really good deal!  Although it's not the most convenient Roy's location on the island to access (due to the parking and traffic in Waikiki), I believe it's the best location in terms of quality of the food and service."}, {"review_id": "0ve2wsoHQdGOBdJU_AbjiA", "user_id": "iCYMf_sHRevmzWg8la-LVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "I had wanted to come to Roy's since my last visit 7 years ago, and was so happy that I was with people that love seafood this time around! Also really glad to come to the location that chef Roy is still with!Our waiter was so fun and friendly and extremely attentive. Would recommend reservations as this place gets packed!We started with cocktails and a firecracker roll and hamachi carpaccio. All were fresh and delicious.We all wanted the butterfish, but luckily I saw the beachwalk trio at the last minute. Butterfish, salmon and mahi mahi for about the same price! Came in perfect portions with a bowl of rice, and each fish was perfectly cooked and accompanied with sides perfectly. The lobster broth with the mahi mahi, I just kept dipping my rice in it, no shame. The butterfish, so tender and melted in my mouth like...butter. Salmon was amazing too.I had checked in on Yelp (of course) and the offer is a free chocolate souffle cake with ice cream! It was divine!!! Licked the whole plate clean!!Highly recommend a visit here and will be back the next time I am there!"}, {"review_id": "wFqjZmcqJweqwMd07z3z8g", "user_id": "cDGvjAG3BptN0-ubbwXh-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I have been to Roy's in two location.

This Waikiki location is ok but like another review had mentioned, the tables are very close together. We went on a Wednesday but every table was taken. I had Roy's Classic Tasting menu and wine pairing. I chose the Macadamia nut crusted Monchong with the Kona lobster sauce and spatzle. It was delicious! I actually just tried Monchong for the first time the day before and am hooked! It's a firm white fish but has a high oil content so not dry. The Mac & cheese spaetzle that accompanied it was amazing.  Mmm, so rich. The wine pairing wasn't that impressive, I wouldn't do it again. I'll order my own wines next time. My friend had the $78 porterhouse steak  which was huge. It could probably feed 3 people. It was tender but boring, not crave worthy. I love a good steak but would order the Monchong over the porterhouse any day. Service was efficient, not impressed but not disappointed. I had the macnut tart and my friends had the chocolate soufflé. I forgot how amazing that soufflé was. It seems so old school but it's still around for good reason! Roys' chocolate soufflé is truly decadent, a chocolate lover's dream! The warm soufflé with the Lappert's vanilla ice cream is such a perfect pairing. I don't know why I got the tart : (  It was just ok, kind of dry. I didn't like the raspberry drizzle, tasted chemically. I have a love/hate with raspberry drizzles. Overall, a nice dinner. You can't go too wrong at a Roy's restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "wxZGzjhcWvSx_PCJMBkMtA", "user_id": "UqNAMhCjPTGGnhqcdPBikA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Very attentive wait staff, Domenic and crew. I take water with no ice and I usually find myself constantly reminding the wait team, no ice. But not today, Domenics team remembered and each fill was ice free. Sometimes dining success is based on the most minute and seemingly insignificant things. The food: the prawn Udon was a bit on the salty side for my taste but that's probably because I am hyper taste sensitive to salts and sugars. I should have informed my server, that one is on me. The drink: whisky business. As a very light (only drink in social gatherings) drinker I found this overpowered by the whisky. Taste like a straight whisky on the rocks, there was no business. This is my 6th trip to Waikiki but first time at Roy's, will definitely stop by next visit and request seating at Team Dom's table."}, {"review_id": "0Qf7n3rsjSC1sZEnZtW54Q", "user_id": "39ukxvwXoEO7bJiZy3BxOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "Came here on New Year's Eve. It was a prefixed menu and they even had a vegan prefixed menu- AMAZING! Ambiance: Roy's is upscale, white table cloth, and the inside is clean and spacious. We sat outside near the bar area which was nice because it was warm out. Service: We came here without having reservations and the host said it would probably be around and hour. She was really nice and said she would call out our name when our table was ready. We had drinks at the bar while we waited. We were called an hour later and got our table. Our server was nice, funny, and explained everything on the menu.Food: Being a pescatarian, I was worried about the prefixed menu so hearing that there was a vegan prefixed menu really excited and impressed me! The server let me do a mix match of the vegan and regular prefixed menu since I wanted only the fish and couldn't have the meat courses. For my meal I got fresh fish, watermelon squares, sweet potato bisque, seared ahi, and red velvet cake. Everything was absolutely wonderful. I've never seen anywhere jazz up watermelon like they did- So creative and delicious. The seared ahi entree was the freshest I've ever had and the wasabi sauce with it was perfect. Everything was so good we ate every bite. Such a great dinner, service, and overall restaurant. I would recommend Roys to anyone looking to have a special night out."}, {"review_id": "g7ieA8rJObFMNsmorEGI2w", "user_id": "ROqAyvO8RPky1-TUrXUfvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Had dinner at the chefs table Thursday...appetizer (poke and sushi), entree (short ribs and butter fish), and dessert(pineapple upside cake) were all excellent!Had a Hawaiian martini, it was good but a tad too strong.

The food was incredible and the service and hospitality....well I have never experienced anything like it. My mom has extreme gluten and dairy allergies and our server specifically made a point to help her navigate the menu and work with the chefs to create a sauce to fit her allergies and to compliment the dish she ordered. We seriously had three different servers wait on us during our time at the restaurant. The first server described the dishes of the menu, the second took our orders, and the third made sure our water glasses were never empty and our dirty plates were removed immediately. I have never ever had such attentive and friendly staff wait on me in my entire life. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!! The appetizers, drinks, entrees, and desserts were exceptional.

The filet mignon was the best I have EVER had. I'm from Canada and raised around great beef and chefs and was amazed I came to Hawaii to find the best!
