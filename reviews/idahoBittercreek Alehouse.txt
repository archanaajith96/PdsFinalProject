Plenty of TV screens (we were catching the NFL draft) so it was perfect to park ourselves for a while.They have a pretty extensive tap list and I like the way they separate it out (hoppy, session, etc) so that you can quickly find what kind of beer you're feeling like. They even had a kombucha that I tried as well. The hubs got the poutine because he loves the stuff... He actually said it was almost too cheesy! (Not in a bad way) He really liked it. I got a smoked trout salad - It had fennel, house made pickles, hard boiled egg, and fried crispy onions. This was so good and filling! There was a ton of smoked trout in it. I was pretty full by the time I was done so I had to call in the ringer (hubs) to help me finish it out. It was super delicious though. I would come in just for that salad again if I was ever in the area. So good!"}, {"review_id": "2_QgUZ1RF2-ANkH6kvpJ5Q", "user_id": "Y-fPeP9dmciMYg83esNSWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update for their street tacos!This was an interesting selection for me, seeing as when I come here my eyes usually go straight to their appetizers and burgers. I decided to switch it up this past weekend and give their street tacos a try, and I am so glad I did!With this dish you get two tacos and a side of your choice. Fries don't pair well with tacos (well, I guess maybe they could), and salad wasn't sounding like what I wanted...so I decided to get their black bean quinoa salad on the side. It was light and fresh and came topped with avocado which made it pair perfectly with the tacos. The meat in the tacos was tender and each bite was delicious. I was expecting the dish to come out in soft tacos, but the shells they use seem to be fried a little bit to help them keep their shape. They also put a habanero-carrot mixture in these tacos, which is tasty but pretty spicy. Overall, these were pretty dang good! I'd order them again. One last thing- we came here with a time crunch of 40 minutes to eat dinner. We found a table, ordered food, and were served in that amount of time. Way to go Bittercreek for feeding us yummy food on a time crunch and helping us get to our show on time!"}, {"review_id": "0SrEIZyYwTpFeafSxoiAvg", "user_id": "G9P3h7ZGdbdc_Zt6IKC2vQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "This place definitely missed its mark with me. Bartender was way more attentive to everyone else. I didn't know there was a lunch special, but her friend who sat by me sure did find out as soon as he was seated. The wings came out pretty quick. But that's where the good things ended in the food department. They are advertised as \"buffalo anchor bar wings\" (I've been to buffalo and anchor bar for their wings) - hopefully Ancho Bar never finds out they are using the name because they are not good. The sauce on top is okay. However, the wings taste cheap and have that layer of fat that freezer wings you buy at the grocery store have. I couldn't even finish and wings are my go to food. The ranch was mediocre. No thanks."}, {"review_id": "GbBlp_cpOTk9z-VOB1bRqQ", "user_id": "VlnGIiScv9_LRNBTTdukVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Amazing veggie burger and fries!

Good beer and a great server with so many good suggestions on food, beer, and things to see around Boy-see (admittedly been practicing that word). I had the Rueben with no bread and a side salad. It wasn't your normal Reuben meat and they may have forgotten the sauce (well, till the awesome server noticed its absence), but it was uniquely good. And the solid was legit for a side house salad... let's just say not your average house salad. My mom had the wedge, pictured. It didn't look like your traditional wedge so much as a blob, but she loved it and the tastebuds are much more important than the eyeballs while eating. It's worth the stop. Convenient parking all around too. And super close to Freak Alley Gallery, which you should also visit. Yep, randomly plug for crazy art."}, {"review_id": "MEcSeq_uiNSCy0GxklvsLA", "user_id": "jCF2lKTngLwbUt1dVg08nw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Came in on a Wednesday night around 7 pm and the place was packed but we got a table pretty quick. It's kind of a seat yourself type place where some smaller parties may charge a large table. Kind of a cool environment. Our server Cody, was awesome and very quick to get us drinks and ask if we had any questions. I am terribly indecisive when it comes to ordering and he recommended me a good beer.We ordered the polenta fries (highly recommend), I ordered the Spicy Lamb Burger and my wife got the Mac and cheese with bacon. I was not very impressed with the burger as it was a bit dry and lacked flavor but That Mac and cheese was amazing and so were the fries. We finished off the dinner with some beignets even though we were stuffed.

I had a Manhattan and it was very good. My bf has a Blanton Old Fashioned and he said it was the best  old fashioned he's ever had. We also had the Classic Poutine which was the best I've ever had. I've had poutine in Canada and Bittercreek's poutine was far superior. We loved this place so much that we came back within 12 hours (lol). The lamb burger was excellent. The bloody Mary's were good. We also had a meat board with mustard. It was fine but I wouldn't order it again. The BEIGNETS are a MUST! Better than Cafe du Monde in New Orleans. There I said it. I had to buy their merch because I'm in love.

Been going here for years. If you haven't been there, please go! Located on 8th street downtown. They use locally sourced products when they can. Just an awesome place. Always have an ever changing and extensive variety of brews on tap. Today, I went with Payette's Barrel Aged Culture Clash. A barrel aged Belgian dubbel that took me by surprise. Really good.In terms of food, we started with the classic poutine.I mean really you can't go wrong with poutine. Bittercreek's is solid. Fries, cheese curds, gravy, and they add pulled pork. Delicious! I will say, not as good as St Lawrence Gridiron's, but St Lawrence has something that is quite special when it comes to poutine. I'm sure I will do a post for them at some point in the near future.My wife's thoughts: it was too salty, but so is she, so... Anyways, on to the burger. Now Bittercreek has probably the best burger I have ever had in my life. It's called the Huntsman Burger and it is amazing. Cheddar, blue cheese, and bacon. It's so good! I decided to change it up and go with their Short-rib burger. It was good, but nothing too special about it. My wife and I went to Red Feather lounge about a month ago for our anniversary where I ordered the short ribs with risotto. It was seriously amazing! I figured since Bittercreek and Red Feather Lounge share a wall+owners, the short rib would be as great as it was during our anniversary dinner. Unfortunately it was not. It was still good. Just not as fantastic as the Huntsman Burger.Great... now I can't stop thinking about the Huntsman Burger. Guess I'll have to go back sooner than normally would. Like, tomorrow."}, {"review_id": "1rylumWjba4s_hJzjHjwuw", "user_id": "lgoMChnRVAP_s_OgHQa56Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "This is one of my favorites in Boise. Went there for dinner last Friday at around 6:30 and there were still a few tables available but the place was hopping already. I loved the ambience and our server(Reanna, if I remember right) was just wonderful. She introduced me to Meriwether cider which I am crazy about now. Hubby loved their IPA's. A definite must have is the poutine with pulled pork. It was so good my 8year old wanted it all to herself. We had salmon with ceasar's salad, a lamb burger with a side of black beans quinoa salad and a kid's fish and chips for our entrees. The salmon was cooked perfectly at medium, the ceasar's salad was ok, the lamb burger was huge, moist and spicy good, the quinoa salad was delicious I was tempted to lick the bowl. The kid loved the fries(chips) that came with her fish but she didn't really like the fish. She prefers the British-style which is battered instead of the breaded kind that they serve here. I thought the fish was moist and pretty good too. By the time we left at about 8:30, the place was packed and a band was setting up outside on the street for what seems like a concert. Wish we could have stayed longer but we had a long day.Another plus....they offer military discount!
