The place was packed on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.We started with oysters and a mimosa Lorraine which was awesome. I would get that drink again and would love to make it at home! It has Peach Combier, Black Cherry Combier, orange juice, and sparkling wine in it.The bread basket came and it was hard to hold back. Everything was fresh. I nibbled while I waited for our starter of three cheeses. Cheese plate awesome! The meaty soft cheese could have been the only cheese on earth for me. It was incredible. The other two were good. The cheese came with another basket of bread, some apple slices, Spanish almonds in honey, olive tapenade, and sauces. For my meal I had the avocado toast. It seemed to bready for me after two courses of bread but was still tasty. The egg on top was cooked perfectly. Like the side salad- very french. After we ordered the Macaroons. There seemed to be a question in the flavors and I was still unsure as I ate them. Loved the loud french music in the WC. Also loved the wallpapers. The 3D floor not so much. Ok it was nice but a 3D floor and alcohol is probably not a good combo!"}, {"review_id": "0sMsIA4P0HZDcU0-6dYejg", "user_id": "vvvDtPXzZHnAYxEChQkjyA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I'd been DYING to get to Parc for literally years....so to celebrate a milestone with a great friend i was happy to go there.  Initially we opted for outside seating, but shortly thereafter our party of 6 opted to go inside.  We had a great waiter, and managed to rack up over $200 in just drinks.  For whatever reason, we received our check for the drinks...despite the fact our intent was always to have dinner.  We were confused, but explained that we were also eating, and everything seemed fine.  We all then placed dinner orders; the women then left the table to the restroom, leaving the sole husband there.  When we returned, he told us that the waitress told him we had to vacate the table by 6:30.  It was about 5:30, we had not yet received our food, and that was the first we'd heard about it.  The waitress was very apologetic, she thought we knew, \"they\" said they told us.....blah blah blah.  Despite the apologies, they were insistent that the table HAD to be available by 6:30.  The manager came by to apologize;  i told her had we known, we never would have spent over $200 on drinks.  She continued to apologize.  I was furious.  She then left and came back and told us that they'd taken a round of drinks (2 beers and a wine) and a beet salad off of our check.  I was unimpressed, and of course the apologies.  The manager gave me her card, \"please come back and use my name....\". I immediately passed the card to my girlfriend, as i will NEVER BE BACK.At the behest of the server, the entire meal ended up being complimentary.  However, they still wanted us to vacate our table by 6:30, so at the end of the day the eviction stood.I WILL NEVER GO BACK."}, {"review_id": "sItdyK0-VrJnijy1e33gvA", "user_id": "Y4XzMdMGACOsY3vD8FWodQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Food is really good - service is a bit hit or miss.

Love the new beet salad on the menu - served with avocado and topped with greens. The tuna carpaccio is always wonderful! For lunch one day, my friend and I shared the two as appetizers, and the delicious grilled chicken sandwich. Not to mention, a nice bottle of rose!On a recent summer night, I had the bouillabaisse for the second time. I don't know how it took so long for me to try it but it's now hard not to order when I am there on a Friday. The stock and tomatoes together are rich and delicious. You'll want to soak it up with the accompanying crostini or freshly baked bread. My friend ordered the Pasta Primavera which was also full flavor and wonderful."}, {"review_id": "lgJeJ18Buxi7K0pA-RIo-A", "user_id": "hmn6HsHwTxQTPl-D9OQY1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "My visit to Parc transported me to Paris.

The bread basket was instantly on the table and had a lovely and generous assortment. The salad was refreshing and had a balanced acidity and crunch. Dressing was a lemon vinaigrette and was perfectly ratio-ed to the greens. Escargots were served shell-less in an adorable staub cocotte and were buttery and delicious. Main plates of moules and steak frites were excellent. The steak was medium rare and was perfectly cooked. The mussels were in a lovely buttery herb sauce. The frites were a little salty but had that delightful crunch. The meal was decadent and extremely satisfying for some indulgence!Our service was also impeccable. The restaurant is large and busy! The servers are on point though and excellently trained.Overall a great meal in a primo location off of Rittenhouse Square.

The pistachio cranberry hearty toasts that were paired with the pate were everything.Save room for dessert as they looked decadent and artfully crafted and are best paired with after dinner drinks or a specialty coffee.

At a first glance, this place has lovely interior designs which definitely makes you feel like you are not in Philly (Europe maybe!)Food we had: (1) Duck L'orange -- interesting mix of duck breast and leg; they are cooked so differently that you might doubt if they come from the same place... duck breast had a texture of steak, and you can even see some pink in it. 2)  Onion soup gratinee -- so fun to play with the cheese! 3) Mushroom soup (4) complimentary bread (all have different textures and interesting flavors, but the ones with pecan and raisins are my fav) (5) complimentary puff (6) complimentary macaroons.

A favorite hangout but most of the entrees (and we've had several over the years) are mass produced and not always hot or fresh. This visit we had a great table outdoors, wonderful cocktails and beet salad but the entrees of boulliabaise and lamb shank were meh. Still the people watching and sipping a drink in the sun was a wonderful time before heading over to the Curtiss for a student recital. Our fries were stone cold little bits and pieces (immediately replaced with a much nicer serving when I asked) and the table next to us sent back a trout dish. Our waitress shouldn't have accepted the fries from the kitchen and even delivered them to us in the first place they were so sub par imho. We were not offered bread.

I've been to Parc a handful of times. All of my experiences have been fine, nothing amazing, but definitely not less than four stars. My husband and I were in the Rittenhouse area last Thursday and we decided on Parc for an early meal. I was excited as I hadn't been there in quite some time. The weather was some of the first real spring weather we have been wanting so badly here in Philadelphia so the outside wait was a lot longer than indoors so we chose to sit inside. We were seated in a section that only had one other table. So I will start by saying we were in a secluded area so I tried really hard to give the benefit of the doubt to our server who completely forgot about us. When we were seated it took a few for our waitress to acknowledge us. She came over basically said hello and then disappeared. When she finally surfaced my husband and I watched her cater to her other table in front of us. The floor manager walked by us, acknowledged us, knew we had been sitting with nothing for awhile, and still walked by not saying anything. It wasn't until we had to flag her down again to grab our waitress. The floor manager apologized and took our order herself. A bit later our waitress walked over and apologized by saying \"Sorry I really forgot about you guys!\" While laughing. I wasn't amused and that night I realized 'hanger' is a real thing. They brought over our food and onion soups shortly after. They also brought us more complimentary bread on top of the complimentary bread they originally give you when you sit down. I guess that was there way of saying sorry? I only found the onion soup just okay which I was surprised about. For entrees my husband ordered the steak frites and I ordered the warm shrimp salad. I had a bite of my husbands steak and it was so ordinary. He wished he had ordered something else. NOW, my salad. I could go on forever how amazing it was. Every flavor worked, all ingredients went together, and the shrimp was out of this world. Definitely worth $20. Highly recommend it and it was the saving grace of my meal. Lastly, the bathrooms. Parc, did you just have a bad night? I walked into my stall that didn't have toilet paper. Went into another stall still no toilet paper, but they conveniently had two rolls laid out all over the floor to use. How nice!"}, {"review_id": "vQ85t5dxAoljq0VFBXiTXg", "user_id": "N0z6z49Ae8xJXE677xuGYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I honestly don't like giving out 5 star reviews because I feel I really need to be \"wow'ed\" to say my experience was perfect.

The atmosphere makes you feel like you've been transported to France for a brief moment. You can't go wrong with inside or outside seating. I'm interested to go back and try their dinner menu sometime soon."}, {"review_id": "CCeQSTGsAIG2g-dFUIzBKg", "user_id": "kmh26B5KG2zLTh0l5WgZ_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "That was tough: in the beginning of our dinner I really thought this place would not get more than 2-3 stars, but by the end of the dinner everybody at our table begged me to give Parc at least 4 stars which I did. Eventually, 4 stars seemed like a half honest opinion of our experience. My verdict: Don't set your hopes too high when setting your foot at Parc.We ordered west coast oysters, the so called shrimp salad(see below,) a New York strip, a French onion soup, two desserts, two cappuccinos. The desserts were really  great, the rest blah. We didn't enjoy our oysters - the insides had shells which we had to retrieve from our mouths and that made the eating experience messy, if not unpleasant. My husband praised the French onion soup, in his opinion it was the best he ever had. Special notice about the so called \"shrimp salad\":  the amount of shrimps made the name for this salad very misleading. The title for the salad was \"warm shrimp salad\" coupled with the whopping price tag of $20 mislead us into thinking that the predominant ingredient is shrimp. It wasn't so when my husband received his salad - it had only 3 shrimps, the salad leaves were the predominant ingredient. Thus, I think the less misleading name for such a salad would be a \"salad with some shrimp\" or a \"salad with 3 shrimps.\" Certainly, \"warm shrimp salad\" is not the right name. Accordingly the price tag for such a lacking in shrimp salad should have been much less than $20 something dollars. Next, the steak was fine, my mom enjoyed it (since I didn't personally try it I can't say anything more specific about her meal). The desserts were absolutely delicious as was the coffee. Here is why this place doesn't deserve more than 5 and why I initially thought 3 stars might be too good for this place - the service was very much lacking ( which seems to be a trend we have so far observed at Mr.Starr's restaurants.) Our waiter was nice, alright, but we had to wait a long time to get our food. What I absolutely couldn't stand - our salads were delivered at the same time as our hot meals. This meant that we, as slow eaters, got to our hot meals when they were no longer hot. Working through our salads took us about 15-20 minutes, so you can imagine that by that time the steak was not warm at all. I honestly don't get that at all! Sometimes our waiter would disappear, and thus when we needed extra utensils or something else we found ourselves asking another waiter for help which didn't make that waiter very happy judging from his facial expressions. Finally, some of the utensils were dirty which is unacceptable from a place that charges a premium for their salads that lack shrimp and their tiny oysters which are sprinkled with shells and other foreign debris (aka sand). I give it 4 stars but this review was heavily influenced by my husband, who thought that the place deserved the benefit of the doubt, and my mom, who enjoyed her steak  and didn't mind a slow service. I, however, think that while the desserts were exceptionally good other aspects were thoroughly hopeless. If it was totally up to my critical, but honest self,  this place wouldn't have gotten more than 3 stars( if not less). Please don't order that salad with 3 shrimps as it is a rip off and please steer away from their oysters ( unless you are a professional sword swallower and sharp objects in your mouth is a matter of your ordinary life)."}, {"review_id": "davn60DtmL2O0c0MJ0HQng", "user_id": "JW5W4OZCohTvZlRF1jzrTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I just love this place. Its presence alone makes all of Rittenhouse more inviting and appealing.

I have been here several times and have never had a bad experience. The service is always great. The server always brings a basket containing some of the best variety of freshly baked breads you'll ever have. The oysters here are some of the freshest I've had. The French onion soup is dynamite. The steak tartar is as good as it gets. They have several awesome lunch options, including a delicious cheese burger and country chicken club. My favorite lunch option is the croque madame. The sauce monay is to die for. I am still thinking about that meal. Obviously, this place could get pricey fast if you indulge in the best the menu has to offer, but it doesnt have to break the bank if you grab a lunch sandwich.  But even if you splurge, it will be worth every penny!

The food and general vibe of the place is really good! However, I've been to many comparable places in NJ/NYC and think that Parc is a little bit more expensive, which is why I docked one star. A lot of this lost value comes from the fact that the entrees largely do not come with sides. And I love my potatoes!!! I've found all the appetizers to be pretty good! I've tried the Salmon and Steak tartare, French Onion soup, and the escargot. All pretty yummy, thought definitely not the best I've ever had. French onion soup surprisingly left a little impression on me, but it seems like a lot of people like it. The bread was DELICIOUS. I ordered the duck last time I went, which came with some mushrooms and onions. Normally, for a 30+ dish it would come with a side of potatoes or something, but I had to order it in addition. My father ordered the sea bass - but again, it didn't come with a side for a pretty expensive dish. Otherwise, it was pretty delicious. Again, not the best but pretty yummy! My favorite dish from them was the Beef Bourguignon, which I tried to later recreate with my boyfriend. Spoiler alert - Parc just does it way better. Idk why I even tried.  The vibe is super nice, and the restaurant itself is incredibly cute. It's a really nice place to go as a first date, but I'd recommend going somewhere else for more money efficiency. We went for my boyfriend's birthday, and they actually brought over a small, complimentary palmier with his creme brulee. Small details like this make Parc a really good dining experience.tl;dr - go to parc a couple of times, enjoy the vibe and the food, but keep in mind that it's pretty expensive for the food you get."}, {"review_id": "U9bYzHn31Ciw0wA-giRW1Q", "user_id": "5YI9JMxpsL575J_uMaRwVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Let's start with you know a restaurant is amazing when they bring you fresh hot bread fresh soft butter (salted butter) and then you order oysters on the half shell and they're not Sandy gritty the shells not in the oyster  it melts in ur mouth.
