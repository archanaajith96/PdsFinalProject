Beyond the nachos though, everything is very good and I have never had a bad experience in the 10+ I have been eating there.

It has previously been a reliably good place to grab delicious food and beer. To their credit, the White Sands pizza was still as good as ever, but rest of the experience was lacking. We called on our way over to see if there was a wait and were told no. When we arrived only about 10 minutes later, the lobby was full of people waiting up to 20 minutes (with at least 5 tables in the restaurant empty). The hostess seemed to be falling asleep at her station and spoke to us as if we were bothering her. 20 minutes later, we got a table. Our waiter was very nice, and we sampled 3 beers. All three were flat, and their seasonal sour (Cosmic Yum Yum) was the least sour sour we had ever tried. We ordered nachos (I recommend, they know how to do nachos here), pizza, and mac n cheese. Their mac n cheese previously stood out as one of the best we had ever tried. Tonight it had a strange texture, as if they had mixed cottage cheese in it. I will not order it again. Overall, Turtle Mountain was not worth the trip into Rio Rancho tonight."}, {"review_id": "7-PUCXZy8RuCCS-_PmQ43g", "user_id": "KCO6mcmFQbZovh0P-NTSKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "I'll update my review the next time I go, since I've only been there once and got only one beer and one food item (a small sample size does not represent a thorough review!). I came over on a conference day because we were allotted a good amount of time for lunch. I tried a variety of beers, but eventually settled on a pint of the Oktoberfest. The bartender was very friendly, although it was during Balloon Fiesta, so maybe he was prepared to be that way :p Very knowledgeable about the beers and the company and such. I had the wings after seeing all the good reviews. The wings were really frickin' good. The sauce was just spicy enough, and had its own unique brand of flavor that would have me coming back just for that in the future. They were also perfectly cooked. My only suggestion - use bigger wings! They were tiny! The sauce is awesome, but the size of the wings was a major buzzkill. Other restaurants are able to use bigger wings for a similar price, so, like, go for it! :DSomeday I'll go back when I have another conference, or it snows and I can't make it back to ABQ within a reasonable time frame ...."}, {"review_id": "hs3dWArK2K9cE-YAz30QIQ", "user_id": "VPDl5lC-TNJCdV5OqM9JdQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My friend Morgan and I visited here last week for lunch.  The pizza here is the way to go.  That wood oven cooks the crust to crisp perfection.  We killed an Italian sausage pizza, I had some green chile on my half.  On the side, we ordered chicken wings, medium, which were meaty and definitely blew Hooters' wings away.  We dunked the wings in some tasty, thick blue cheese dressing.  We sampled about four different house microbeers, and settled on the Marzen.  This was a German beer similar to an Oktoberfest beer.  In fact, it was so good I ordered a growler.  I wasn't surprised, because Turtle Mountain has some of the best beers of local microbreweries.  We had a good time here and I'll be back again."}, {"review_id": "hE2E2JOVqCsuglF_i3NHjQ", "user_id": "hc5UpC8rrrG44x2Ejisqsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "The adage don't judge a book by its cover certainly applies here.

Their pizzas are top notch and the beer can hold its own. My wife always gets the buffalo chicken pizza (I forget their name for it) and i, inevitably, have food envy! Its really delicious with a nice amount of toppings but the flavors don't get too crowded.I do not have a regular but have yet to be disappointed (Honestly, I should also order the buffalo chicken but I like to get something different).When we go, we often end up at the bar. They tend to be surprisingly busy.I will say, my only real complaint is that of the two patios, they only allow dogs on the one. And that one is the smokers patio without real waiter service (you order at the bar, they bring it to you). It's certainly their prerogative, but if i am planning to dine with the puppy, I will choose somewhere else."}, {"review_id": "9ugCex3H6o58bJv79RHfkg", "user_id": "iJl6_7d4UWNHtBZz9MwpJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/2/2017", "text": "Turtle Mountain is one of those places that you can choose anything from the menu and just know that it will be superb. Their pizza is excellent and if you haven't tried it before, you should really get one with their Italian sausage. It's spicy, chunky, and full of deliciousness. My go to is their Shiprock which had Italian sausage, mushrooms, pepperoni, oregano, and mozzarella.      This time we ordered their fish and chips, and a burger they call The Chuck. The burger had beer battered onion rings, thinly sliced grilled jalapenos, cheddar cheese, and BBQ sauce. It was so good! The fish was hot and flaky and served with their house tartar sauce that I would drink if it was socially acceptable. I love the capers that they put in it. I can't tell you what else is in that tartar sauce, but it's totally different than any tartar sauce I've had elsewhere.      There's usually a wait of at least 20min to get in no matter what time I come here, but the service, beer, and food are so worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "sGni6r8n2tSvXMVDFVf7Wg", "user_id": "wJ-lAqXvk-bp1joQ5aqGSA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/17/2017", "text": "Turtle Mountain. This place is a staple in Rio Rancho. It's been around for quite some time now. Hell, I used to come here after school from time to time with my girlfriend and I'm taking high school. They've moved to another location since then. The spot there are at now. Much bigger and nicer than their old digs of course. Over the past ten years or so, it has pretty much become kind of a go to spot for my parents. They really love the pizza. It's been a while since we've been able to make a visit together but we did recently for my brother's birthday dinner. Here's the result. I ordered a half order of there green chile alfredo with chicken added to it. A burger, order of chicken wings and the fish and chips also made the cut as well as nachos as a starter. The pizza held up to its reputation. Good stuff. The wings were good as well. Cooked well, not as much heat as I expected but they were tasty. The fish and chips offered nice portions of meaty fish. The only two that lacked were the burger and pasta. My dad ordered the burger which arrived with a completely soggy bottom. He went to pick it up and it simply couldn't be. He had to cut it up and eat open faced with a knife and fork. As for the pasta. It was pretty mediocre. Tasted like it came from a can, which it very well could have and added green chile to it. The green chile used had a nice flavor with a light heat to it, so it certainly helped the pasta, just not enough. The bread had just a little too much oregano on it making it not possible for me to finish. Pooey. As I recall these things now, I am even saddened just to think about it. Alas, I am still a fan of the Turtle Mountain Brewing Co. I still recommend the spot. Enjoy some good beer and pizza. Go early though, some nights they close at 8:30 pm, others 9:30 pm.

The best thing about it was the kickass horseradish-heavy mustard. We both loved that!We both ordered calzones and mine was made incorrectly. Our server immediately took it away and got another one started for me. As he said, calzones take probably the longest of any of their menu items, but the cook put a rush on it and it came out pretty quickly. It was correct the second time. We both ended up taking home half of each of the calzones ~ they're pretty large.My husband's cup had a crack in it and his orange Fanta was leaking on the table. We pointed it out and it was replaced immediately, but I'm sure our server was thinking OMG can anything else go wrong at this table???
