The restaurant is a small storefront shop with maybe seating for 20 total. We were served by a lovely gentleman I assume was the owner (and Mr Elsa).  He was super helpful as we picked out our meals and teased me about asking for forks when apparently Ethiopian food is always eaten with your fingers. Who knew?  But he kindly still gave us forks. We ordered a meat and veggies combo meal and loved it, particularly after the owner showed us the proper way to eat our food. What a wonderful experience all around!"}, {"review_id": "Mbi2q23pcu8XS94SEs3XAg", "user_id": "9bnvU4rRbIquYcpa1DFkuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Lovely Ethiopian place. The food is delicious, the service is super friendly, no lines, clean place, easy parking and reasonable price. I'm not aEthiopian food expertise but hands down for Elsa's cooking.

The Vegetable Sambusa is a great opener stuffed with seasoned lentils.You cannot go wrong with any of the combos here as I have never been disappointed.    No matter what route we go, the veggie combos or the meat combos Dinich Wat has to be on order it is a great very flavorful potato and carrot dish and it blends well with a few of the meat dishes.  I have always loved the way lamb tibs taste it is the perfect when eaten with injera, the tomato, onions and jalapenos  just all blend together into this really flavorful dish, the reduction at the bottom with the spices is the best. They have loads of other great meat  and vegetarian entrees, this place is just best experienced with a group of people so you can make the most of the large sampler plates, you will not regret it.     Just be careful with those honey wine as they can pack a punch and it may not be the best idea to have a few or it could be a great idea if you are the passenger. The ice tea here is pretty awesome as it's packing a bit more than Lipton.       Everything just feels lovingly prepared and you get the distinct feeling that you have learned a bit of the Ethiopian culture after each visit. It is my favorite place to eat in all of Kansas City the level of hospitality is more akin to an intimate dinner at a close friends than a dining experience I am always looking forward to my next visits to Elsa's."}, {"review_id": "cTxVOiilKpx9ErYb38qk-A", "user_id": "lcRkGpx6QuK6c0NpYQv-gQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/5/2017", "text": "I love the downtown Overland Park location.  Nice spot!  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The sambosas, lentils, various types of wat, injera, all delicious and savory as I would expect.  I ADORE Ethiopian cuisine.  Kansas City is lucky to have what we have here in the way of Ethiopian choices.  I love them all and this place was especially nice because it is more intimate."}, {"review_id": "wkLVQbNJ6L_sxlDRClDYXw", "user_id": "Oavbr8dUe96Ap75kSwHhww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2017", "text": "Yay! I try to eat Ethiopian food everywhere I go because it's one of my favorite cuisines.  This place was really quiet on a Tuesday evening and we were quickly greeted.  The menu isn't too overwhelming and has all of your typical Ethiopian items.  Seeing the meat combo, I got that. I was a huge fan of the doro wat and the cabbage and the spicy lentils.  What was kind of unique was having your own combo plate instead of sharing a giant one with someone else.  They do give you the option if you do want to share, but with your own, you can really dig in and not be shy about eating all of it.  My only small critique was that most of the items on the combo plate was salty, instead of spicy.  But overall, I really love this place!"}, {"review_id": "AuARFLEnHJWrghM7Aq450Q", "user_id": "REqOsBVnobAlbl8UCtA2tw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2017", "text": "Wonderful Ethiopian restaurant, family owned.

The lentil sambosas are a tasty way to kick off your meal. Their meat combo is a nice sampler: the berbere sauce-drenched dishes - doro wat (chicken drumstick stew) & key wat (beef stew) - are the highlights. But in my opinion, the vegetarian combo is where they really shine; the way they cook/prepare the vegetables - green lentils, spicy red lentils, yellow split peas, collard greens, potatoes & a cabbage/carrots dish - is divine. If you order it for carryout, you'll have more than enough for two meals (especially with the generous helping of injera).Another special menu item is their Ethiopian honey wine/mead (or \"Tej\"), which comes in a neat Florence flask-like vessel called a \"berele.\"From what I can tell, it's usually relatively uncrowded on the weekdays, so that's a perfect time to go if you're in the mood for a quiet, relaxed meal. We're so lucky to have both this place and Desta's (another wonderful Ethiopian restaurant which opened a few months ago) in the area!"}, {"review_id": "tZM2Xnc0nGSM-TYhrFI9NQ", "user_id": "69yRB0XB2y-uzhJmI6NOyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "The food is excellent.

I'm pretty sure Elsa is the cook, she brings the food out with a smile on her face. Asks how everything is and is all around sweet.

We got there on a Friday around 3 pm and there wasn't a soul in sight. Very quickly, a lovely lady walked out from the back and greeted us warmly before seating us. She offered us the menu and let us be. My husband and I spent a fair amount of time poring over the menu, as we weren't very familiar with the food. Finally, we decided to get a vegetarian sambosa appetizer and a combination platter each (his meat, mine vegetarian). The owner came back and we placed our orders. She was very attentive and made sure to ask if either of us was vegan. Since we were each getting a platter, she asked if it was okay if she made a giant platter for the both of us to share and said she would surprise us with the dishes. We were fine with this and let her do her thing. Up first, the sambosas, and my, were they delicious! We could've eaten at least ten more. They came with a tomatoey dip (harissa, maybe?)--delicious! We didn't have to wait long before the owner came back with the biggest platter I've ever seen, filled with colourful dishes and tons of injera (a spongy sourdough bread) bordering the edge. The platter was filled with two lentil curries, yellow split peas and potatoes, collard greens, an egg in some tasty sauce, and then a few more meat dishes which my husband said were delicious. He wasn't a fan of the taste and texture of the injera, which I didn't mind too much. Other than that, everything was delicious. The owner came out to check on us and jokingly chided my husband on using utensils to eat instead of his fingers. In between my laughter, I instructed my husband on how to use the injera to pick up the curry. He failed miserably. We ended the meal with some tasty coffee, very happy with our experience. The owner was wonderful, the food was fantastic, and we can't wait to come back again!"}, {"review_id": "nbcifHsfjfEovlAdgGxbGQ", "user_id": "oMXBYYVta6Klm61vLmG2FA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/1/2016", "text": "We decided to start with the Sambosas which is like an African samosas. They were filled with lentils and you dipped them into this amazing red paste that I have no idea what it was. Maybe berbere? I don't know. But it was great.So what did we order for our main course? We decided to go with the Meat Platter. It comes with three meat options and two vegetarian options. The meat on there was:Doro Tibs (chicken in a onion/tomato sauce)Key Wat (Spicy beef)Alicia Wat (Prime beef)The veggies were a collard green dish which was awesome and a fresh cheese.The owner was awesome. He saw us struggling a bit to properly use the bread and instructed us on the proper way to use it. You tear off a small piece of the bread, place it flat on the food you want, pinch, don't scoop, and bring it up straight to your mouth. The bread was really good too. It had a sort of spongey feel to it and was a really fun way of eating.It was a good time.
