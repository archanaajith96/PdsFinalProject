The food is quite good for a really tiny place by the water.  Their $28 lobster dinner, which I had for lunch (no it's never too early for lobster dinner) was definitely worth it. I loved how sweet the lobster meat was, and the steamed clams that came with it were delicious! Their lobster sandwich was quite good as well. We definitely enjoyed it.  The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was their New England clam chowder. It was just a tad bit salty.  It did not seem as if it were cooked the same day.The view definitely made our dining experience even more memorable.  The view of the water, boats, and the harbor was simply breathtaking, even in the winter.  I would love to go back in the summer, during their happy hour, in which they bring out free oysters to customers. A couple of tips for folks who are thinking of trying it out: When going for lunch, go as early as possible. Despite arriving a little bit past 12 pm, I still had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. The mimosas are quite strong."}, {"review_id": "cpED9ihiKjA8Fhh38sQoiQ", "user_id": "l6RlZ31H6_a9GPvY83Y3Iw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "I enjoyed the food I ordered as did my companion. Crab stuffed mushrooms were amaaaazing!! Large portion for $12ish.  The half dozen Maine oysters were the star of the evening. Plump, flavorful, fresh. The seafood casserole was fine, but it was the seafood bouillabaisse that had great flavor. A little pricey but a good Old Port tourist stop."}, {"review_id": "tPV6dseHFgTIngO_QWRCBQ", "user_id": "v9erjZ4JXQAT0en2Yz7Akw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "I know all we have different tastes but I'm an Asian.

I did a bit of math and each piece was going to be 2.60-2.80 a piece depending on if we got a half dozen or dozen. We got a dozen, but the size of the Maine oysters were huge. I did not realize they could come in this size. We also got a clam chowder which was alright, I've had better and this one we had to add a bit of salt and pepper to. I'm really knocking a star off due to the waiting. They said 20 mins to a couple in front of us and they waited 45+... We were promised 45 mins and that was a bit more accurate. Would come here again for their oysters when it's not so busy."}, {"review_id": "MVU7IDPx7IbGbCB9yrEmtw", "user_id": "nJVS18mJIB1hCHq1YsFbUQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Unfortunately this was one of the very few restaurants that were able to accommodate for my party of 10 on a Saturday night in Portland Maine over the summer. That was a mistake on our part since we didn't do prior research. We got seated outside on the dock with two tables joined together. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and entrees. Everything was really bland for me and I felt like the shellfish weren't cleaned enough because I ate a lot of sand. The salad came out and it was the saddest salad I ever seen. They literally placed dressing packages on top of our salad - I felt like I was eating a cafeteria lunch in high school. I was expecting the salad to be dressed. Was I missing something here? They could've had a bad night here, but based on what I had, I would not recommend this restaurant."}, {"review_id": "cK5miokxZy9bHLjqaVXSRQ", "user_id": "xNMTBISjkLaSnhaayWXoYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "There are many excellent restaurants in Portland Maine, there is only one J's.  Old school on the harbor, local, casual, friendly, good.  It may be a bit rough around the edges for some, but that is its charm for most.  It's been here forever, hole in the wall serving steamers, lobsters and all kind of local seafood, like the seafood casserole I had tonight.Lots of people know each other here, but they still smile and say hi when I walk in!  Kind of like a Maine Cheers, for those of you old enough to know that reference!

We all wanted that last lobster roll and steamer clams! I got a bucket of steamers and half a dozen of oysters. I had tried the steamer clams at other restaurants and definitely wanted to get some more in before leaving. We had to wait a little bit for a table because it was a Saturday and I believe we saw a lot of kids in graduation gowns at the restaurant with their families. There is inside and outside seating -- we chose to sit outside because the weather was nice. The service was alright, but our waitress had a really bad attitude. I know it was busy, but she made a side comment that was unnecessary the second my friends and I sat down. Overall, the food was delicious and was a nice last meal in Portland."}, {"review_id": "F6bmBds9IBJKm6HbyjYluQ", "user_id": "m1AUK8tI19tUT_N3DMkyIQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "This is the reason you visit Maine, for a nice hearty lobster meal, and J's Oyster was one of the best lobster meals my fiance and I ever had!There were a ton of restaurants that served lobster in Portland, to no one's surprise, and seemingly they were all very similar according to the online reviews. However, what drew us to J's were the positive reviews about the quality of their food and the fact it was truly a restaurant first. My fiance and I dropped in for dinner at around 6:15pm on a recent Saturday evening and waited for about 40 minutes for a table, which wasn't that bad. There was the choice of either eating indoors or in their small outdoor area. We chose indoors because it was a bit chilly/windy outside. The indoor dining space was tight and dim. The bar was smack dab in the middle of the room and tables aligned the walls, but all of the tables seated at least 4 so there was plenty of space for the 2 of us.We already knew what we wanted, which was the lobster entree, but we decided to take it a step further and go all out by ordering multiple appetizers. And go all out we did, as even the waitress was taken aback by how many dishes we ordered! Here's the rundown:NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER - A bit too watered down for our liking. There was plenty of potatoes and clams inside, but the chowder was not thick enough.LOBSTER STEW - Same issue as the chowder as the stew was very thin and a bit watered down. It could have used more thickening. However, we were surprised at how much lobster meat was inside, which we really appreciated and was fine by us!OYSTER SAMPLER (Raw, Baked, Stuffed, Rockefeller, and Mornay) - Unfortunately, there was only 1 oyster of each, but every single one was delicious. Actually, our waitress saw that there was 2 of us, so she gave us an extra raw oyster, which was super nice of her. All of the oysters were fantastic and the cooked ones were perfectly done.COMBO SEAFOOD COCKTAIL (Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, Raw Scallops, and Raw Oysters) - All of the seafood was so fresh and really to die for. It was everything we wanted wrapped up in one appetizer dish. It definitely wet our appetite and set us up for what was to come.LOBSTER ROLL - Other than the chowder and stew, maybe the other disappointment of the night. Disappointment might be a strong word though as the lobster meat was refreshing and the bun was toasted to perfection with butter, but it was basically just lobster meat on a toasted bun. No extra seasoning or mayo mixed in. In fact, there was a packet of Hellman's mayo on the plate for customers who wanted to smother some on their lobster. We preferred if the lobster was seasoned and mayo'd up for us. Also, included in the dish were a pickle and some ruffle chips. This is probably the one dish I wouldn't recommend if you go with the lobster dinner.LOBSTER DINNER (1 1/8 lb lobster) served with steamed clams and corn on the cob - Yes, yes, yes! The plate was as glorious as we had imagined. A huge lobster sitting on a plate of steamed clams and corn on the cob. The lobster was amazingly fresh, as though it had just been caught out of the bay. Every time we cracked a piece of our lobsters, hot water just spilled out oozing of lobster flavor. It was full of meat every which way and perfect. On the other hand, the clams needed cleaning. Although they were steamed very well, there was a lot of sand in them and each piece absolutely needed cleaning inside the bowl of water provided on the plate. The corn was OK, nothing to write home about.We were 100% satisfied with coming to J's Oyster over the competition. It was everything we wanted out of a meal in Portland. There were some hiccups, such as the chowder, stew, lobster roll and steamed clams, but the lobster was what we were here for and it delivered big time. In addition, our waitress was fantastic. She was flying all over the place and apologized that we received our chowder and stew late, but she explained why. We also had a small conversation after our meal about our origins. Overall, a fantastic restaurant to fulfill your lobster dreams!"}, {"review_id": "-49PxKEUS6NCgbcwoJfdsw", "user_id": "7d2Q9S-aMBHEtIaRailidw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "A pretty small, and low key place.

I contemplated a long time reading reviews for many of the restaurants before settling for Js. Js doesn't have any grand decor. In fact, it really can use a makeover inside and furniture upgrade. However, service was really good. Very happy and bright people. I ordered the lobster stew, lobster roll, and haddock sandwich. I skipped the steamer since I saw reviews talking about the steamers having sand in it. Really not a fan of sandy shellfish. The lobster roll is not bad although I've had better. You do get claw meat and not mixed and shredded meat. The lobster stew was a let down for me. I guess I wasn't expecting the taste of alcohol in it. I wish I tried the clam chowder instead. The lobster stew is pricey too at $12.5 a cup versus $7 for clam chowder. The highlight for me was the haddock sandwich. I almost missed this on the menu. Not until I was ordering that I saw it. The waitress immediately said that the haddock sandwich is her favorite. The fish filet was breaded and fried just right. The batter wasn't too thick and wasn't soggy at all. The fish was moist and with just a schmear of tartar sauce, the sandwich is just perfect. I would've given Js 5 stars but the lobster stew was just not good. Other than that, I think Js is a solid choice for a Portland lunch!"}, {"review_id": "pXAdWBTk1nW_cnI5Mrw5Iw", "user_id": "qYmEtAA-W3OPFe9dupSdVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "Love this divey little place.  They have Guinness and good steamer clams.  Very small place on the inside has been lively every time I have visited.We just stopped in for steamers on this visit so there isn't much more to review.  But if my memory serves me correctly, the prices of steamers has risen considerably since the last time I came to visit.  Not sure of its the time of year or other environmental factors but I still had a good time."}, {"review_id": "VGheeN5gBGVFPITJskb5pA", "user_id": "SHK4mlXGz2FY2lo2r1eomQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "This is a must stop if you are in Portland.

I come for the fresh seafood everytime I visit. This visit was terrible. A waitress named Jackie was serving us, a party of 5. Her attitude towards us the entire meal ruined the experience for my sister and her family. When the drinks where bought over to the table, my youngest nephew held onto the plastic cup a bit too hard and her immediately respond was so nasty; with the most attitude in her voice \"don't hold it like that.\" I don't believe anyone should have the right to parent kids that are not theirs. She also proceeded to add a 20% gratuity to our check, but when my sister paid with a credit card, she had the audacity to ask if she wanted to leave \"a tip\". Excuse me miss, but was the 20% gratuity you've added to our check not enough? I ordered a few items only because I wanted them to try it first then get additional orders of things they liked. Her attitude made is want to leave. We ended up eating elsewhere with better service. Did I forget to mention she didn't even come around to our table to check on us? No napkins, no refills of water. I have never been this disappointed by your establishment. It's time to check on your staff."}, {"review_id": "CY4a9Dm9GQR2pox0hSODNQ", "user_id": "8Io3kh3e22akC6MsuMMPWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/2/2017", "text": "Lobster roll $18 stuffed with lobster a lettuce and nice chewy bun.
