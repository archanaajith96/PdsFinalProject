I loved seeing the little market up front, but it didn't appear to be open at the time. It was early on a Saturday evening, and it wasn't too busy yet. It was filling up by the time we left though. You could tell that they have a lot of regulars here as customers and staff knew each other by name.  What else do you get at a \"sausage factory\" other than sausage? Well three out of the four of us got sausages, but I opted for the jäger schnitzel. It was really good! I did try some of their sausages too and liked the kolbasse best, followed closely by the Marshall beer brat. I didn't love the red cabbage, and the cucumber dill salad wasn't that great. The cucumbers were a little too soft for my liking and almost slimy.The sauerkraut was a little soggy from being under the sausages as part of the sausage sampler. I loved the pretzel bread they bring out first, and the house mustard was wonderful. I wasn't too impressed with the bread pudding either. The edges were too hard, and you couldn't cut through it with the provided spoons. My overall take was that they do sausages really well, but the sides and dessert were lacking a bit. We had outstanding service though which warrants 4 stars over 3 any day."}, {"review_id": "QOS2EGFCyp3sS30oTWqrIQ", "user_id": "kVt96BKgLo0gehgS4jAZwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "We've bought meat and sausages here for years but have never made it to the restaurant.  Luckily, we made time Friday before a big game.  Beware that this place gets packed but we were there early and didn't have to wait too long.   Our waitress, \"Olga,\" was feisty and hilarious.  She arrived at our table with her put-upon German accent and immediately surmised we needed beers.   It was a bit odd, though, that she simply offered an amber, a lager, and a wheat.  We hadn't seen the beer list yet so we just went with one amber and one wheat.  These were great but we probably would have gone with some more exotic offerings if we had known.  Because it was a game night, we felt like just \"Sausages on Buns\" and tried a knockwurst, a hot link and a Polish.   (If you want two \"Sausages on a Bun,\" it's $5 more.)   These sandwiches come with frites (which were good but not what I expected).   They also automatically come with a authentic sauerkraut/onion mixture.   I loved it.  These are pretty hefty sandwiches and I would not recommend the add-on.  That way you could order strudel at the end of your meal!Service was good and we were treated to a serenade as one of the waiters sang to a large table.  An unexpected treat.I want to go back to try a really relaxed dinner and enjoy some of their other offerings.   I would definitely like to try their authentic German wine flight as well."}, {"review_id": "I_p0kCBRQnYjeCT9MRuarg", "user_id": "OrGr2ugD-bzuhdHYhbT4Hw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/31/2017", "text": "This would be 5 stars if it's just the restaurant. My husband and I liked the food more than we thought we would. My husband ordered Wiener \"Frankfurter\", Hot Link and Spicy Buffalo Sausage for his Siegi's Sausage Plate. The sausages went really well with the sauerkraut and hot german potato salads considering that it's the first sauerkraut that my husband actually likes. I would recommend my Jäger Schnitzel too.Now, for the deli, I know I'm slow because I have no idea what to order. There are many options. I wish the staff was more helpful, but my husband says delis are not meant to be that way. Anyway, a lady found a random sausage on the shelves in front of the counter, and the staff took it behind to wash it before putting it back on display. I'm not too sure how hygienic that is.."}, {"review_id": "pFYk2obNDX7Q8Sw6lYQ11Q", "user_id": "y1PFtSTmU0YFqeXfXcLqdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Like the calm atmosphere here, even when they are busy.  I got the Bavarian pretzel, which just tasted like bread, the cheese dipping sauce was okay, love spicy mustard.  My husband got the Reuben this time and he said it was fantastic.  I wanted something new, chicken schnitzel (kind of greasy) red cabbage (sweet) and German potatoes (fantastic).   Next time getting the Rueben/lentil soup/salad option, all fantastic."}, {"review_id": "caV3jBxbouPZmwanOpszuQ", "user_id": "B5yJ9g5MyfxLveBFL16Clw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "We absolutely adore this place! The food is pretty consistent. The service is usually wonderful, but every once in a while we find that the server takes a very long time. For that reason I wouldn't say that I can give it a five out of five. I would also say that this is a kid friendly environment, as long as you know that it could take quite a while to have your needs met. There is a restaurant in the Oklahoma City area called Royal Bavaria and it is one of our favorite restaurants in the entire United States, and this comes relatively close to it."}, {"review_id": "fax_2UdAYREqTOO7WUKt6A", "user_id": "47qzmxfcUplt8nmD-cyeGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "I tell you people!

The bratwurst burger used to be my favorite, but I think  they stopped doing those and went to a slider version.... which is ok.. but i liked the old one better..

I have eaten sausage all over the country. Very few places are as good as the sausage at Siegi's! My favorite is the coarse ground Gobe sausage which is a kind of brat. The cheese stuffed Kasewurst is very tasty.  There are dozens of different kinds of sausage on the menu and in the deli side of the store. The wienerschnitzel is excellent here almost like a German version of a chicken fried steak but lighter and in my opinion better. Sorry to say that to all my CFS friends but it is true! Recently tried the Hungarian Goulash and it was awesome. The have excellent German fried potatoes with bacon that are not to be missed. So much great stuff to try here with a full meat market if you want to cook at home. One of Tulsa's true treasures.

Fantastic. Warm, friendly, and knowledgeable. Our server seemed to know good pairings, complimenting my girlfriend on her beer and sausage pairing. Turns out she was right so it's good to know that at least some of the staff has a good idea of the food and beer in the place. I am sure the rest are competent as well.The food? To die for. I love sausages and Siegi's has some amazing sausages. I got the two sausage plate, which though it says it comes with sauerkraut and German potato salad they let me switch out these out for French Fries and German Potatoes. What? I like potatoes. The meal is $12, but I did grab two of the premium sausages so it bumped it up to $14.Sausages: I picked out the Spicy Buffalo Sausage and the Spicy Chicken Brautwurst. Both tasted amazing and had just enough heat on them to enjoy without causing pain. Could they have been spicier? Sure, but I'm not going to hate on them for this when they aren't bragging about it.Go to Siegi's and try their sausages. I imagine the other food is good, but man that's some good meat they've got."}, {"review_id": "af46CVXCu2Jxjn22nAweYg", "user_id": "5gWep0OXJ4UcNbDbf13_TQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/22/2017", "text": "Siegi's ignited a love for German food within me that I didn't know I had.
