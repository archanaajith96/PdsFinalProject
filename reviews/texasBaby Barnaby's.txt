The food is always delicious&service is great. The only downsides are ease of parking, limited space, and the wait. Be sure to get there early or go on a day you're not doing much because there is always a guaranteed line at Baby Barnaby's. Upon arrival, make sure you put your name on the waitlist on their hanging clipboards outside. They don't have a parking lot, so you'll have to search for street parking around. The Blueberry Pancakes and Green Eggs are my go-to favorites. The pancakes are massive, filing, and extremely fluffy. The Green Eggs are heavenly. The chicken apple sausage that comes with the Green Eggs are delightfully juicy with a nice crunch on the outside. The potatoes are seasoned well and eggs are divine - slightly creamy with a nice balance of cheesiness, you can't stop eating after one bite. Portions are huge, so thats always a plus!You may have to wait at Barnaby's, but trust me , its worth it!!"}, {"review_id": "xXCVc64lVwdZ-Rr2RgNi9w", "user_id": "4IFV7-ijckMWktp3jGVFyA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "The only bad part about this place is parking sucks...I got a ticket for $40 and warning they do ticket!!  We went for breakfast and I had the green eggs which was delicious.  Hubby had French toast and it was also a solid yes.  This location has a funkier Montrose vibe that I like and is not as whitewashed as the other locations.  They have freshly squeezed oj machine...awesome.

The wait was about 30 minutes but it wasn't too bad, there seemed to be many people who were willing to wait, including myself. I ordered the Migas. Now, although they aren't the \"traditional\" migas, they literally were thebomb.com. I enjoyed every single bite. The portions were huge and for the price, it's a damn good deal. I ordered a side of tortillas with mine just because I needed all the carbs apparently lol.  The portions were so huge that I could finish everything and I notice other people sharing plates so that should speak for its self. The place it's self is pretty small but you won't notice with all that goodness in your plate! You'll definitely be glad you waited."}, {"review_id": "6sdqIjzPcEP0CikxnosB8g", "user_id": "od0fu1L9OqE5E9XywRffZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Be prepared to wait, especially during peak times like brunch and the weekend. There's limited seating indoors and outdoors. Fortunately, they offer complimentary hot coffee while you wait. Also, make sure to put your name down on the clipboard hanging outside. It's not like most restaurant where there's a host to take down your name.Now to talk about the food.. Do yourself a favor and order the green eggs! My life is forever changed. I was visiting Houston for a few days and have been dreaming about this dish ever since. The eggs are scrambled with cheese, artichoke, and spinach (hence \"green\" eggs) and the combination of these ingredients makes for a perfectly seasoned and flavor egg dish. The eggs are served with chicken apple sausages, toast, and half a plate full of breakfast potatoes! The potatoes are well seasoned and crispy but there were so many that I couldn't finish them.As an added bonus, the service was superb. The restaurant is dog-friendly. My friend brought her dog along and she was served a water bowl and dog treats. Our waiter also served us complimentary biscuits that were made in-house. I can see why this place is popular with the locals. Definitely have to come back here on my next trip to Houston!"}, {"review_id": "s61jUkLEAcUuJhQfZK5ufQ", "user_id": "DuNi6Rgk8eZjFahCyFxp6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Ate here back in 2016 when I was in Houston for the final four.

Bring your dog! Atmosphere: BE WARNED! You may have to wait. It's a bit small, with some inside and outside seating and there's usually a wait. Be sure to write your name on the clipboard hanging in front of the door!! That's how they know you're waiting in line. Service: 5/5 Our waiter was the bomb dot com. Sweet, funny, and so friendly! He explained all our questions about the menu so well, brought out a doggy water bowl and biscuits for my friend's dog, and even brought out a plate of biscuits that they make homemade for us to try! Price: 4/5 Typical breakfast prices. $10ish dollars for a meal, but the plates are full and well worth the price. Food: 4/5 They're known for their green eggs and ham, so I HAD to try it since it was my first time! Their eggs are perfectly scrambled with cheese, spinach, and artichoke (think of spinach and artichoke dip in a scrambled egg form) with a massive amount of potatoes that were roasted, seasoned perfectly, and crispy on the outside. It also came with toast and chicken apple sausage which was nicely grilled and charred ! I can definitely see why it's recommended."}, {"review_id": "nScxlXPz0dNY1bUIA4MPrQ", "user_id": "fafQY-OvIFOO0ail09Mvgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "A cozy brunch place in a small neighborhood. Parking is on the streets. This place is always crowded because of how popular it is. We already expected a wait when we came in and it was a doable wait. Tables are usually available according to the number of people you have. Just sign your name on the list and wait on the bench outside.The inside is really small but they have a few additional tables outside. Red velvet pancake: Not too sweet, the texture of the pancake was soft. We ordered this because the waitress had said this was one of their items and it wasn't on the menu yet. The pancake itself could feed 3 people. The cream on the pancake made it too sweet to be eaten with. You can get it with banana slices on top. Buttermilk waffle: The waffle also had a good texture. It had plenty of fresh berries and bananas on top. Good portion and could probably feed 2 people. It also tasted great with the syrup on top. Bob's healthy platter: 6 egg whites with a salsa dip. Also comes with a bowl of fruits, sausages, and 2 toasts. The egg whites goes well with the salsa. I like that their fruits are served fresh. Green eggs platter: My favorite out of the 4. A popular item on the menu. It also comes with tater tots, sausages, and 2 toasts. The green eggs were the best because of the way it was cooked with the spinach. The tater tots were also super crunchy and plentiful. I didn't have room in my tummy for the toasts after all the food. Services were mediocre. My friend said there was a stain on her cup so we asked for a new one. The cup never came even after we asked the waitress a second time. We also asked another waiter to take a picture of all of us since it was my friend's birthday. He said he would come back but he never did. We overlooked the service because we could tell how busy the place was. Overall, everything went well and the food was delicious."}, {"review_id": "nrbWoMeJ3rgX-xadclM0aA", "user_id": "ZRhPO5WBT9VL1pVBxY5y4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Had to wait about 15 minutes but the service and food is absolutely amazing!

Even on a soggy, overcast day, we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend patio visit. If you've never been, be forewarned there is no host to greet you. There is a sign up sheet prominently posted just before you get to the front door that asks for your name/party size/seating preference (indoor, outdoor or first available). Myself and the remainder of my party of two (first available) missed it, so I figured I'd pass the pro tip along and save you the embarrassment of wandering aimlessly as we did. The service was hilarious - we could tell our waiter would've rather been somewhere else, but he was gracious and exceptionally agreeable and that made me giggle since he, like me, wasn't all that able to hide his true feelings. This is not a complaint at all. Everything came out quickly and was delicious. I had to form a barrier around my perfectly cooked breakfast potatoes to ensure my husband didn't eat them all before I had a chance to enjoy them. The pancakes are perfect for sharing...with a family of 6...and possibly the neighboring tables. They're huge. They're also delicious! There's nothing here that I wouldn't order and nothing that I think you absolutely MUST order, but you definitely MUST visit."}, {"review_id": "rbmAKqIcsek6K2og3VVQHg", "user_id": "zUuqiib4c1gtftJs4MWjvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "After a year of settling into the city, I finally made it to this neighborhood brunch favorite on a weekday around 10:30.

No concerns there. I'm giving it only 3-stars because of the food. It was fine but a little disappointing. I was absolutely craving huevos rancheros and luckily they had it on the menu! However, what came out of the kitchen was just eggs, beans, a warmed up flour tortilla, and a side of salsa. I mean, look the beans were tasty, and everything was cooked well but it's not huevos rancheros without the ranchero sauce. Salsa is not the same thing and I was really sad. Also, the tortillas (personally, I think they should be corn), should be toasty and crispy. This was like a plain build your own burrito. My friend's order of the Migas looked delish. So, recommend ordering that instead if you're looking for an egg dish."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/baby-barnabys-houston-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
