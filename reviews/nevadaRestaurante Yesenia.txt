Danny is the owner and Chef of the restaurant, right after our breakfasts were served, a few bites later he was at our table to check on us and talked to us about his history in Reno. 60% of his Customers come from California and also from all over the world!  They checked on us a couple more times  after that.

We could rank them in that order. At $2 a piece, we loved them!Service was quick and helpful, the tacos took a little to come out but they were fresh so no complaints from me!

But what it is, is great Salvadorian food.Owner Danny (I hope I got his name right) has been calling Reno home for about 10 years longer than I have!He has a profession cooking background and comes out to the table to find out if you're enjoying your selection.My family (wife and dad) wanted to try something new. As is usual, no one could come up with any ideas. Then, my wife struck gold. She pulled out her phone and started to casually look for breakfast places.We found Restaurante Yesenia.It's a store front restaurant on Moana. Across the street where Standard Brands Paint used to be.     I told you I lived here a while!There is ample parking and when you look for this restaurant, look for \"Yesenia\" in the middle of the sign.Upon walking in, the interior environment is not presumptuous at all. There are banners, flags and other adornments on the wall. It's clean and friendly inside.We didn't know what to get, so all three of us ordered the breakfast burrito. Which, according to Henry (Danny's son) is just like their \"Super Burrito\" except it has egg. We ordered it with steak. I got the combo (rice & beans) so everyone could try some. The taste of the burrito was awesome!Good texture, great taste. And, filling too!Danny came by and offered hot sauce. They had brought salsa to the table and it tasted good but it was missing the kick. This stuff had a kick that grew with every bite. It was good without killing you.----------------Bottom LineYes, I will be coming back here again.The friendly service was a wonderful touch. Personable and nice. I felt like I was welcomed.Prices, very reasonable. Environment: For what it is, 100% acceptable. Quality: Very goodStaff: Friendly and welcoming"}, {"review_id": "wLxlGhUcf6KM-xwA6IWqiA", "user_id": "sfLTjzc1ceEpzZRnXz512Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "This is not a large chain restaurant and the environment is warm and inviting. Nothing fancy or upscale here, but the food is quite good and the price is reasonable. The only drawback is the drinks are from cans, which I do not like. However, the quality and quantity of the food makes up for most of it.I tried a chicken enchilada and a beef taco. Both were quite good, and the beef would be more accurately called chunks of steak, well seasoned and tasty. My wife had a quesadilla and was served four large slices of tasty chicken and cheese filled quesadilla. We noticed that this restaurant was frequented by what was presumably locals from the immediate area; generally a good indication that the quality is consistent. And although we felt a bit out of place, everyone was very kind and courteous to us and we felt comfortable.We will be going again as we enjoyed our meal a lot!"}, {"review_id": "4Rp7-jqjkXoj2FnPwlLZ3g", "user_id": "-GowNe73gDZs9MfS3ugJDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "Hot damn, I think I may have found my newest regular lunch spot!No doubt many of you have driven past this place, located by one of the busiest sections of the city.  It's an unassuming storefront amongst other unassuming storefronts.  You've certainly seen places like this before.  In general, I find these sorts of joints to usually be pretty good on the whole, as they go less for glitz and put the focus more where it should be, on their food.  So walking in, I was expecting to get some nice fare and to leave satisfied.  Instead, I left thinking of when i could swing by again to try more of their amazing dishes.Upon entering, you see it's a small sort of place, a dozen or so tables, walls festooned with posters of El Salvador and various soccer parafanalia, a couple TVs overhead usually with a game playing on them, and nice music in the background.  You can take a seat, at which point one of the exceedingly friendly staff will come to help you, or you can order at the counter to-go.  I browsed through their menu, everything looking delicious, and was tempted by much of what they had to offer.  But I had pupusas on my mind, and ended up going with the combo platter.  Looking on their a la carte menu, I also had nab one of their shrimp tacos.After placing my order, I was given some fresh-made chips and house salsa.  And I do mean really fresh chips, as I almost burnt my finger on the still hot from the frier oil.  A short time later, my food was ready and brought out.  The combo plate included two good-sized pupusas along with rice and beans, with accompanying sauces and pickled cabbage.  The shrimp taco looked a bit on the small side for the price it cost for just one, but once I took a bite, I was utterly hooked.  The fillings were utterly delicious, and the tortilla was obviously freshly kneaded out fully by hand.  Quickly polishing it off, I moved on to the pupusas.  Cheesy heaven, they are.  Nothing beats these little stuffed cakes, and I relished each morsel as I cleaned my plate.  The pickled cabbage provided a nice side dish, and the sauces were nice as well.The check came, and I could not believe the price.  All of this delicious food for under $12!  Oh man, what a deal.  Suffice to say I left with my expectations thuroughly blown away, and I will definitely be back here again.[Fast Forward To Next Day]Oh, what do you know, I did end up coming back here again!  Going for take-out this time with the Loroco pupusas, a chicken flauta and a sweet empanada for dessert.  Once again, everything was amazing.  And I like the loroco in the pupusa, as it gives it a lighter texture.  And the empanada was very good; made of tangy, starchy fried plantain dough.  And all this take-out for $10!  Geeze, these prices rock.I love these more casual sorts of places, as I have more often found them to do food the right way and to just enjoy the business that they do.  Top marks for service, atmosphere, food, and really everything!"}, {"review_id": "6SWXWB2NYdhGzxfwL-Ce-g", "user_id": "4ywoghefRTsbi1SzkR-fcA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Wanted the pozole but they ran out of that by dinner service, so I ordered a carne guisada plate instead.

Doesn't hurt that they're one of the top rated restaurants on Yelp in our city! There are places where looking the direction of the staff will yield some nasty looks, but at Yesenia, their number one concern is that you have what you need and that you're beyond happy with everything. It's like you're family, and that's probably because this place has family at its core.We dropped in for a later dinner, and sadly, the restaurant was kind of empty. That didn't stop us from going to town on Salvadorian specialties! Dos pupusas de lorocco (that Salvadorian vegetable) and dos revueltas (mixed pork, bean and cheese), plus platanos fritos and an order of yucca con chiccharones made up our meal. The pupusas are crazy substantial and we walked out with two of them to go. The platanos are the perfect bit of sweet to cut through all the richness of this food. The yucca frita was surprisingly refershing, topped with fresh cucumber, radish and curtido (Salvadorian pickled cabbage). We asked for some spicier salsa, and were given some made from habaneros, which was exactly the kick we needed.Prices are crazy cheap for this food. We ordered all that food, ate, and had enough leftovers for two meals all for $25! This restaurant is in an unassuming strip mall right off Moana. If you've driven by a million times like I had before my first visit, make it a point to put this one on your radar and stop in soon. You'll feel like family!"}, {"review_id": "3lTzORR3kVL7oYd7DrSsfQ", "user_id": "6He7CwCnjxeCN9Cs-X8i7g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "I definitely won't come here for pupusas.

Restaurante Yesenia did not disappoint. Walking in the first impression and thing my dining companions and I stated was \"Wow, I feel like we are back in Southern Mexico\" and \"We want to go back to Mexico soon\".  We said Southern Mexico because we have never been further South than Guatemala and haven't had the pleasure of visiting El Salvador. The only difference we could determine between Restaurante Yesenia and a restaurant in Southern Mexico was that the staff was watching a basketball game and not soccer. Our waiter and the other staff was super friendly and prompt. They gave us enough time to talk uninterrupted, while providing us will excellent customer service e.g. never had an empty glass, etc... The also all wished us a great day as we were leaving and made certain we didn't forget our jackets that we had left in the back of our chairs. While the food did take a little longer, it was worth the wait! Everything came out freshly made and delicious.  Also, the price for food here is super reasonable. My dinning companions both ordered the Pupusa Combo Meal. Their meal came with beans, rice and two pupusas. Restaurante Yesenia offers many fillings for their pupusas and you can choice up to three fillings. I believe they said the cucumber, spinach, and zucchini pupusa was their favorite. I ordered the Fried Plantains with two eggs (cooked away way I wanted - I picked sunny side up).  The fried plantains were cooked perfectly! They were not too sweet and had a hardy 'starchy -ness' to them. Their slightly sweet flavors contracted perfectly with the eggs and hot sauce. The plate also came with 3 sides of your choosing, I had beans, crème fresh, and a cheese. The beans were not anything special, but the cheese the dinner came with was excellent. It had a feta type texture, but a totally different flavor profile. I regret not asking what it was... Next time   The dish also can with freshly made corn tortillas, WOW these were amazing! I could eat these every day! I would order this dish again, but without the crème fresh and try their rice. I also ordered a pupusa filled with cheese and jalapenos. The pupusa is not greasy. It is made with a tasty corn 'tortilla' base and was filled with warm cheese and jalapeno slices. It was soooooo delicious! I wish I had ordered the Pupusa Combo Meal and tried more than one version of these decant morsels!  Lastly, they have plenty of vegetarian options on the menu and our waiter was immediately receptive to the fact I was a vegetarian. I'd recommend some of their vegetarian pupusas as a starting base."}, {"review_id": "BOkpq48SzF01S73FfpH0-Q", "user_id": "3wxfNzhVJC6EZyH4xpW7zg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Been searching for an authentic Mexican restaurant after an awesome day on the mountains.

That is all.Okay so this place is great and it's actually hard not to go back (there are a lot of other places I want to try first). On our way in to Reno I searched for some Mexican food and this place came up, which is actually more popular for its El Salvadoran cuisine. I saw they had pupusas, which I'd never even heard of so I was excited to try them. It's a small, casual place tucked into a little plaza. It actually looks kind of janky inside, like some of my favorite local Chinese places in Ohio. It was empty when we got there and all of this was perfectly fine with me!The menu had a lot of stuff on it, and plenty of options for the tacos and pupusas. The staff was really friendly and our water was a young guy who spent a ton of time talking to my dad about hunting, which I appreciated. (My dad has a tendency to over-talk his welcome). We're from Ohio so it was interesting to hear about the differences and the fact that he was a young guy at the end of his shift and didn't rush us was pretty cool. I asked what he recommended for the pupusas and he said that a traditional one had pork, beans and cheese so I got one of those and one with veggies. There are a TON of options. I also got a taco, pork carne asada. My dad got a lunch plate with a taco, pupusa, rice and beans for around $7.50. You also have the option of homemade tortillas for your tacos, which my dad got. I had regular. Both were delicious.I have been to other restaurants since and I can say that these tacos and pupusas are definitely larger than others. I can hold my own when it comes to eating but I finished my pupusa and taco and wasn't miserable but I did take my veggie pups home. The pupusas come with a thin red sauce (not spicy) and curtido (an El Salvadoran cabbage slaw which is lightly fermented and crunchy) which is delicious. It actually reminded me of an asian slaw as far as the flavor, but it's delicious with the pupusas and my dad and I fought over the last of it.I plan to go back here and try some other stuff but honestly the pupusas were so good that I find myself craving them every time I'm wondering where to eat. Truly this place is awesome, and you should try it."}, {"review_id": "sx5Mm0ueIWnWXCUUHLR5Aw", "user_id": "HoWrdKtNADsB019AIBxM2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "I was just in town for work and was so glad to have the chance to eat at Yesenia and meet Danny.

At his suggestion, we started with the pupusas (mixed) which were so delicious I ordered it again as my main entree. I also tried the jamaica (hibiscus drink) and guanabana (sour sip) frozen drink.

The pupusas were their basic recipe: ORIGINAL: Beans, Pork, Cheese, Loroco (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fe…).I also got a Mango Jarritos (my fave) to wash it down. The cabbage was crisp and tasty...I broke my own rules by using the spicy salsa instead of the \"special recipe tomato sauce\" that came with it, but, it was well worth it.I plan to visit often...you should, too!"}, {"review_id": "BBSrFp0_HmwogTUpHuGtvw", "user_id": "DNz_Lab5hRj1AqaBcm_uOQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/11/2017", "text": "This place is SO delicious, if you are ever in the Reno area this is a must stop. I ordered: 1. Pupusas first and foremost because this place is Salvadoran I knew this would probably be their signature dish. I had the bean and cheese and it was crispy on the outside, melted cheeses and refried beans inside that made a heavenly combination with the still soft masa inside. I love the traditional El Salvadorian slaw they topped it with. The dipping sauce/salsa style was flavor packed and had a mild kick of heat which was great. 2. Tacos with handmade tortillas! YES!! That is one of my favorite things to eat, period. You have the choice of store bought or handmade tortillas so naturally went with in house tortillas. I got the combination which I chose the chicken, asada and one vegetarian (it isn't on the menu but you can order it with beans, cheese, veggies, etc..) They were all really well made and well seasoned especially the asada. I got the refried beans and rice on the side and it was good, the rice could use a teensy bit more flavor but all in all a great meal.
