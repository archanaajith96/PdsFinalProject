This place is a must go! And have patience sometimes this place gets packed...

I wouldn't say it's authentic but I looove all the flavor combinations and how tender all the meats were. My husband and I got:Pork belly buns $5 for two - yummmmy!!! The pork belly was crispy and tender at the same time. Loved the crispy shallots and peanut relish as well.Roasted pork belly $6 - salty with a hint of sweetness and 5 spice powder. Really good! Very tender annnnnnnnnnnd they give you so much.Brisket clay pot $14 - so much freaking food. Tendons were absolutely melt in your mouth. They ran out of daikon but they put tofu instead. Stilllll really great. All the veggies inside the clay pot were so fresh as well!Pork belly noodles $10? Very light broth and the noodles itself was also light. The pork belly was again very tender and crispy at the same time. My husband enjoyed it alot.Service was very attentive and the place was really clean. Portions were freaking huggggggggge. My husband and I were discussing that this place would do very well in California bay area. This place is also soooo freaking cheap.2 apps, 2 entrees with tons of left overs was around  $30 plus tip and tax =$50 =)"}, {"review_id": "HBMlD8xVkT9p14cfzxSJPw", "user_id": "I_ijBRCtpzCd0wYA3d2bdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "The roast pork and roast duck rice was great, pricey than I am used to but overall very tasty. The pork and duck were juicy and the veggies were good too. Beef hofen is rich in flavor but a little bit oily. Beef was tender and noodles were soft. Would recommend.Pork belly bun was great though I felt it need more sauce or something. The bun was soft and sweet. The pork belly was juicy and fatty.Zha Jiang Mein was too strong in flavor but the sauce was as thick. Not everyone's cup of tea. The noodles were thick and chewy. Malaysian mein fun was very good but I thought it was just a tad bit too oily. The curry flavor was not overpowering and I don't remember the dish being too spicy. Would still recommend. Overall, a great place to go when craving authentic Chinese food."}, {"review_id": "bEwaSsJfiseGX4Poz6lrMg", "user_id": "ehb7SPb41mD31zrU8_3zkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My first review of this place was over a year ago and was super short. I've been a million times since, so I'll review it again!Han shares a parking lot with dog town. It's very small and is usually full on the weekends. Sometimes, you'll have to find a parking on the street. Han is small, but has a decent amount of tables. I've never had to wait very long, but if you go during dinner time on the weekends, prepare to wait. But that's with every restaurant, especially one as delicious as Han. They offer take out as well!Service has always been good here. Sometimes, it's been slow. But I've been here so many times, I know which servers are fast and I'll ask for them if I need to. The food has always been amazing. Pre being vegan and now as a vegan. They're very accommodating and have plenty of options for all types of eaters. The food has always been fresh tasting and delicious. I've never had something I didn't like. Their prices are also fantastic. A $9 bowl of noodle soup will give you 2 servings easily. Highly recommend this place if you haven't checked it out!"}, {"review_id": "eu-GT3bCnh9-KCDaZNJQFQ", "user_id": "kxfFNz8Bg8jldRKMTUdnSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Delicious and tasty Asian fusion food. I've been here a handful of times, and it's been good every time. The food doesn't have the most authentic flavor, but it's a step up from your typical Chinese takeout restaurant. Coming from NYC, I wasn't sure what to expect and therefore didn't have high expectations, but I like it enough to keep coming back. I've ordered their broth noodle soups and the lo mein. Both were good, but I am eager to try out the other items on the menu. The service has been consistently good. They refill water, and food comes out at a reasonable time. It's not a large space so I could see wait times during dinner hours and the weekends."}, {"review_id": "Dj_woLHguTO87GCY0cltNQ", "user_id": "JVVjAYPY2r2BUWd9RjfLkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "This place is always packed and for good reason. First, you need to try the pork buns. The yeast dough is pillow-like in texture with a hearty piece of fried pork belly. It is crunchy, yet still is incredibly tender;  it practically melts in your mouth. There is a bit of sauce in there as well so I recommend eating over a plate. The sauce is savory with what I think is bits of crushed peanuts. The peanuts add another level to the dish. I got the Dan Dan Mein for my entree. Let me start by saying that if you do not like spice, I do not recommend this dish. Spice lovers are welcome. It has think noodles covered in a chopped pork sauce. It has a nice balance of salt from the sauce complemented with the spice of the pork. The portion is large, so definitely take a doggy bag home if you can't finish, because it is that good. My suggestion is to order to go if it is a Friday after work or call ahead if possible as the wait time can be lengthy."}, {"review_id": "mxZtjmRy2l-KhpXJsmhIuQ", "user_id": "o2FiitaFN-QzAh-xmViEoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Boys and Girls, let me tell you, the Han Noodle Bar just keeps getting better and better. The experience begins with a warm greeting the moment you walk through the door. That sets a mood that almost guarantees you're going to have a great experience. My husband and I began our lunch by sharing an order of fried pork dumplings. They were served with a tart sweet and sour sauce that was perfection. I ordered the roast duck noodle bowl and was served around six large pieces of tender duck breast and crisp bok choy on a bed of udon noodles and all of it swimming in a subtle broth. The portion sizes here are enormous and I filled up long before it was gone. For those of you who haven't tried Han Noodle, do yourself a favor and do so soon."}, {"review_id": "LjC1sWIeKt5IcUCoKgo5ew", "user_id": "cMIVlEuCKkiEo1QkPBbMaw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "While I wanted to give 4 stars, ended up with three stars... so let me explain why I took one star away.  This was my first time and I had to drive around couple time to find a parking lot.... they share the parking lot with the hot dog joint, so I ended up parking on the street.I walked in and was greeted, I said one person and was told to sit anywhere.  I sat down, a menu was giving to me and asked what I wanted to drink - I asked for water.I had reviewed the menu before I came, so I kind of knew what I wanted, but reviewed the menu again.  So I ended up with the following:- Cold Cucumber - Cumin lamb- Dan Dan Noodles- Cold Cucumber - I had asked if this was seasoned in chili sauce and spicy and was told yes, but what I ended up getting was pickled sour cucumber with some carrots. It wasn't bad, but was disappointed because what I expected vs what I got was different.- Cumin lamb - I had to remove the 1 star because of this dish.  Now, I've had many cumin lamb from different joints, but I was disappointed with this dish.  I expected more cumin flavors, but it was lacking.  The lamb meat was cooked perfectly, but it was more thicker cut of meat then what I'm used to, but it was good.  However, I definitely did not smell or taste the cumin flavor in the dish.- Dan Dan Noodles - this as great.  The noodles were hot, the sauce was excellent, bit salty, but that saltiness gave it a great flavor... now, the cucumber that I ordered wasn't what I expected, but the cucumber went well with this dish, as it helped to tame the saltiness.  Overall, good place, I would definitely stop by again if I swing by Rochester again.  I'll have to try their broth noodles next time."}, {"review_id": "zTkHGqOLbXDbPjcBLs-kBA", "user_id": "7cuv0DfmA1ozAd53inFxww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Best birthday brunch I could ask for!!

My noodles were so beautiful and delicious, I had to force myself not to inhale the entire bowl and save some for leftovers. The perfect amount of spice, not too much to make it unenjoyable, but I might have been able to handle a little more. Our waiter recommended the beef dumplings, super tasty and fried to perfection.

Han Noodle is one of my favorite restaurants in Rochester and depending on the length of my trips home I always try to stop in. This place serves incredibly delicious food in record fast time and at a very affordable price. Everything I've had here has been fantastic and delicious, but all noodles considered my favorite thing on the menu is actually the Shiitake Mushroom Steam Bun. I credit Han with my obsession with the fluffy clamshell buns, and they are a must have appetizer when I come for food.

I had low expectations because coming from NYC, the next best thing would be to fly halfway around the world. This place makes decent food. I would call it more Chinese-fusion than authentic Chinese food. To me, it's a less greasy version of take-out with a Rochester vibe-- very main stream. If that's what you're looking for, then great.

There was a line of people out the door,  which I took as a good sign. It was worth the 30-minute wait. We started with the Spicy Diced Chicken Steam Buns. They were a delicious with a nice contrast of the soft bun and the crispy and slightly spicy chicken. For our entrees, we had the \"House\" Broth Noodles and the Spicy Chicken Peanut Noodles. The Spicy Chicken Peanut Noodle was very good, and a rich dish that was enough for 2 meals. The House Noodle Bowl was seasoned perfectly, and had a nice mix of the chicken, shrimp and squid. Our appetizer and entrees came out fast, and the service was responsive. As another reviewer mentioned, Han pretty much ruins most of the other Chinese places I have been to in town.

I've eaten some variation of this dish in NYC, but these are much better my friend was not to pleased with them though.The squid on a very light tempura-like batter came with a peanut sauce.

Han Noodle never disappoints. The atmosphere is cozy. Seating is close but managable. The service is friendly and efficient. I always go for spicy dishes, usually chicken. I decided that Kung Po Chicken would do the trick on this visit. I normally ask for extra spicy, but opted to stay with the regular dish. The chef must have known that I like spicy, because I got SPICY! It was wonderful! All those dried red peppers were great. I did manage a few, but had to concede that I'd met my match. I hope the chef recognizes me, so I get that same level of spiciness. Consider yourself warned. My wife was thrilled with her Roast Duck Noodle Soup. I tasted the broth and it was terrific. You can always tell a good ethnic restaurant when you see people of that ethnicity eating there. It was lunch time and there were several Asian diners with us. I hope that doesn't offend. If you're looking for some good Asian food, visit Han Noodle Bar. You won't be sorry."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/han-noodle-bar-rochester?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
