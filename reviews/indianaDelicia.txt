We went to meet two friends for dinner, and everyone tried different drinks and different food. I loved the agua fresca, and my fiance and his friend both loved the \"Conquistador\" drink. the table split empanaditas which were a must-try; very moist and flavourful. I ordered the duck enchiladas which was BOMB. honestly one of the best meals I have had in the city overall. I would eat this every day. The meat was erfectly cooked, the flavour was balanced, and the green rice side dish paired perfectly. I was totally blown away.My fiance ordered the pescado el pastor. The portion was gigantic, and he was very satisfied with it. One friend ordered the empanada and the other ordered the tamal corn cakes. Both were very happy with their choices. Looking around at other tables, I honestly do not think you could go wrong with anything on the menu!I will say there are a few downsides- one, you cannot make a reservation and they will not seat you at all until your entire party is present. This sucked for us because three of us came together, and we had to wait for the fourth who was coming from work, and who had to find parking. That is the other thing- parking sucks! The lot is really small and it is already a busy area. So overall make sure your entire party is present on the dot, and be ready to spend a few minutes looking for parking (or prepare for a long walk!) and you will have a delicious meal waiting for you."}, {"review_id": "HvK445dwZ7TF8hAVqVkloQ", "user_id": "D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Alexis was great as our bartender w/ her service & recommendations.  I had brunch a few months ago, mine wasn't so great, but my friend's Huevos Rancheros was excellent so decided to try dinner.Parking sucked being that the three spots in the corner looked blocked off, however we parked there & others followed along.  Compliments of the Chef for an amazing Caribbean Sancocho that went soo well w/ our Dirty Hendricks martini!  Wow!  Empanaditatas were good, not great.  Added sauce & was plated nicely just had a different taste.Short Ribs were melt off the bone w/ potatoes, not really a Mexican dish, but a delicious meal.  I was really looking for something exotic like the brunch menu offered, but didn't find it.  Lots of options, but will come back for the Caribbean Sancocho soup that's not on the menu."}, {"review_id": "lgCsGzswRvLAmIAkcYDS1A", "user_id": "ZhRYEnklEhu7bJv5GU9Knw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Beautiful dining room.  Attentive staff.Came for dinner on a Friday Night.Started with Guacamole - excellent.  Someone also ordered the Queso Fundido Con Chorizo - they loved it.Next I had the De Palmitos Salad (Hearts of palm, walnuts, butternut squash, greens, vinaigrette) - very nice.Then I ran into some trouble - there were no vegetarian options.  I had the rice, vegetable mash, and roasted vegetables.  Not super thrilled.  Wanted the Black Beans but they aren't vegetarian.  :(Other entrees ordered at my table were Fish Tacos and the Empanada.  These dishes were wiped clean!Overall it was great, but please think about non-meat eaters too."}, {"review_id": "PxhMAyZ0zqqAv7bHe_h0SA", "user_id": "JGThqXcH7vrWJlvffs4kWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Loved my first visit to Delicia! Went here for Sunday brunch on a date and loved the spot. Beautiful decor and happened to run into a few people I knew who happened to be dining at the same time, so I know it was a hot spot. I also had heard nothing but great things about the place, so I knew we were in for a treat. I ordered the skillet de la casa, made with chorizo, biscuits and gravy, cheese and over easy eggs. Also came with a side of potatoes. Everything was delicious... I almost wished it was a larger serving because I ate everything. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo omelette and enjoyed that as well. I was in the mood for a mojito, only to find out it was the best mojito I had ever had since Tao in Vegas. I'll definitely be back for more of those! Great first impression. Would love to come back for dinner and try more on the menu!"}, {"review_id": "Hivqpoc_r6XiW8lFnc-Yhg", "user_id": "s99qyOY-VqbSl0kXRWd-vA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "A great date night!

This place easily skyrocketed into my top places to eat in Indy. Everything from decor, service, drinks, and most importantly the food was a pleasure. The salmon and polenta made me feel like i was eating love and warmth, which was a blessing from the cold weather and whatever stress one may be experiencing. Too poetic perhaps but that's the best way i can describe it. Portions were great where i definitely did not leave hungry with the devour menu. Ricky Martinez was the chef and I'm keeping my eye on him. They do have a private parking lot with additional parking in the back. They were able to accommodate a party of 10'ish that was celebrating a birthday. Experience is casual dining but i feel like it's a bit more upscale casual. I can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "LAjyvo2esZLVe7KxB_XKVA", "user_id": "8ykj0YKtwkLRj_T4OTu4_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "There's a reason this place has a wait...it's worth it.

Their sides are sooo delish and I loved the fish I got for an entree. For an app we got the calamari but it was legit like eating little tiny raw octopuses because they didn't fry it so it was chewy and rubbery in my opinion. I wasn't such a fan. But I get the concept they're going for with the unique take on normal calamari & I can appreciate that. On the flip side the sauce it came in made up for it and was awesome. The service was pretty good and as usual I always love the ambiance that this place has to offer. Very cool new Mexican vibe within the decor selections. We came on a Saturday night (they were busy) and were pleased to be seated immediately! Price range is a little higher but with an upper scale mexican restaurant, I'd say that's to be expected. They do have some reasonably priced dishes though. I had the margarita and my date had the sangria both of which were very tasty in my opinion. I think I liked the marg a little better but then again I'm 100% a margarita girl. The cocktails range from around $8-$11ish they're good tho and i was pleasantly surprised with the size of my margarita. With that being said, All in all a very good experience!"}, {"review_id": "7z48tcQ4174K_loy0opwzg", "user_id": "MlwTzRnaVw-I6S_V36jLJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "Finally made it here for dinner and I'm still full and happy several hours later. It wasn't too crowded for a Monday night but the lot was completely full.  Once seated, we were greeted by our lovely waitress (I wish I remembered her name so I could give her a shoutout for being the most amazing and professional and personable and knowledgeable waitress I've ever had). We ordered the guacamole appetizer to start, which was good, but I really can't handle much spice in my food and I got a few jalapeño seeds and almost cried (lol). I ordered the winter preparation of the salmon which was goat cheese polenta with roasted red peppers and asparagus with the salmon filet in the middle-simply delicious and I licked my plate clean. My friend ordered the fish tacos and also enjoyed them. Then we just had to get the churros to finish off our girls night. They are dipped in chocolate and half are covered in fruity pebbles and half in sprinkles. Warm and fried and chocolately-what more could you want?Cool vibes and awesome decor. It's definitely an experience and it was more of a drawn-out meal which we actually really appreciated because we needed the time to chat! I will note though that the dinner prices are higher than we were expecting-the lowest entree was $19 I believe with most about $22-24. With tax and tip, my half of the appetizer and dessert and my meal, it was $42. But the service and fun night with delicious and authentic food was worth it. I'd love to come back for some brunch!"}, {"review_id": "CU48WWxmGFI2xg4kFh2cIg", "user_id": "Utra_WbG2uEQeCNpucoIqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "I've wanted to check out Delicia for so long!

The guacamole they served as an appetizer was great, I'm a guac lover, and the pistachios added a really nice flavor to it. We both chose the salmon, and fell in love with this dish. The salmon was perfectly cooked, juicy and flaky. The polenta was amazing. I left wishing I had ordered another to have the next day! It was nice having the signature drinks included with dinner. He chose the sangria and I chose the margarita. Both were very good. I'll definitely be back to Delicia for dinner again.

It's absolutely gorgeous. A trendy bar, intimate atmosphere, along with lots of tables and booths for different size groups. They really did a great job creating an upscale yet lounging kind of wine.The Fook & DrinksI ended up with the Moqueca - it's a shrimp coconut stew & was perfect for the rainy & cold night we went. I wish there had been a tad more flavor but it was still very yummy.My friend ordered the tamale crab cakes and was raving about them throughout the meal. We also ordered the chips & guac as an appetizer which was very tasty & a generous proportion (the peanut salsa was to die for !!) The ServiceI loved our waitress! I honestly wish I remembered her name, Anyway, she was super helpful with helping us navigate the menu (I am the most indecisive ) and kept checking in on us throughout the meal.I definitely will head back soon, perhaps this time to hit up their brunch !

It's the most trendiest, contemporary comfortable spot and I'm just referring to the decor. It sits a little tuck away, so if you're not paying attention, you will pass it up.

My favorite time to dine in is during brunch Between the selection of breakfast omelettes, tacos and enchiladas, I was done for. All were very, very good! The staff is always nice and accommodating.

Its Devour Downtown weekend and I wanted to treat my husband to a great dinner at a restaurant that neither of us had not experienced. Delicia was close to home and the menu looked very tasty. Its located on College Ave in South Broad Ripple in a area that is quickly growing and developing into the new hot spot or an extension of its sister hotspot Broad Ripple. Inside the decore was nice, reminiscent of newer Southern California neighborhood hot spot. There is a nice long bar and the seating is a combination of a long table of high bar seating and regular booths. From the Devour menu my husband chose the flank steak with beans and rice and plantains. I chose the salmon. The meal came with guacamole and chips as well as a drink and churros for dessert. The guacamole was very fresh and very good. There are peanuts in the guac which was very different and probably should be disclosed on the menu. I wished they had proved more guac as there was plenty of chips left over. They offered a choice of two beverages to accompany the meal. A refreshing red wine Sangria or a Margarita. My husband chose the margarita while I chose the very good Sangria. Now the food...As for my salmon...it was AMAZING. I think it came with polenta...I'm not sure...but it was a creamy corn and there was a layer of sauce that had asparagus and other vegetables in it. The whole dish was delightful and the flavors just danced in my mouth with each bite. My husbands meal was where we were let down. He picked the flank steak. Now I'm not well versed in steaks so I didn't think there was anything wrong, but he knew once he cut into his steak that it was overcooked. There was absolutely no red, not even medium, just very well done. The meat was flavorful, but a bit chewy for that cut of meat. The waiter, Nick brought over the manager and she was very nice and asked how she could take care of us. She brought us another margarita and had the steak reordered. However, this order of steak was worse then the first order. Instead of a flank steak this time, we received a very very overcooked flat-iron steak. Once again my husband recognized the issue once they brought our plate. The new steak was so chewy I spit my little bite out...it was not edible. The manager once again came over and this time we just opted for the salmon. She also gave us off Devour menu order of dessert. So, despite the hiccups with the steak, overall, it was a wonderful experience and I would try the restaurant again."}, {"review_id": "3Pqe0YLjcQ3cCkx7sM0gZw", "user_id": "m982bOXdBgpmVU3ROb1B2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/14/2017", "text": "I want to come back to Delicia for brunch, because as I was scrolling through the Yelp photos trying to decide what to order, I noticed so many delicious things are from the brunch menu.

The guacamole was also delicious! The seafood medley dish is a bit spicy. I enjoy spice, so I loved it! But steer towards another dish if you like it mild.
