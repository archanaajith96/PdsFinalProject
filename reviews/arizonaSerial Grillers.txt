The paninis are far and away the best ones I've had and are in the running for overall best bread. I personally love the Pinhead, and it doesn't hurt that they have an attached taproom!It's kind of tucked away, so if you're not looking for it, it's easy to pass by.

We went to the Speedway location, can be easy to pass so pay attention. The staff was great, good food options not under or overwhelming. Set up is pretty cool and would be a great place ti eat and watch sports. I had the mini ghostface pizza and my husband had the manhunter. Food was good and very reasonably priced.Will be back!1 Star-   Total failure of an experience based on this experience would not return. Would not recommend.2 Star-  Below average on several levels, not a total failure. Wouldn't seek out to return or recommend.3 Star-  Average experience, minimum expectations met. Nothing that says wow or that stands out. Would return if someone else wanted to come, not a regular go to.4 Star-  Above average experience, will come here again and recommend to friends and family.5 Star-  This will be a regular go to and will be highly recommended to people I know.

The atmosphere is quite entertaining every item on the menu is named after a serial killer or some type of... \"Killer. (Most are from movies but I'm sure you'll recognize the names once you see the menu.)The menu was a little overwhelming as everything sounds so good and according to the manager, everything IS GOOD! .... says the flavors are put together for specific reasons. Today my daughter ate wings and fries 2 THUMBS U Pbut wants to try the gluten-free pizza next time when we bring her dairy-free cheese. Drank a Mexican Coke in the old-fashioned Coke bottles from way back when. I had the Pennywise Chicken Cheesesteak, a recommendation by the waitress. It was really really good!!!!  Combine that with a Tucson Blonde Pale Ale.... Was a very a very yummy combination! The best part of all of this was the price. Due to our military discount \"THANK YOU SERIAL GRILLERS!\" our bill came to $23. Where can you find that in Tucson for that price and the amount of food we got and the quality?!?!?!?We will definitely be back as we have decided on many different items on the menu we would like to try next. And we will also bring family here when they come to visit. This is definitely a must-see!!!"}, {"review_id": "sv_arFRLJagFShjyOda5Zw", "user_id": "064Z_GuIr54fgJdmDXqnGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "This place is amazing! Amazing food.

It's not just fun-themed, but the pizzas are great here. I am sad I only got to try them a couple times before moving out of Tucson, but I would definitely visit again the next time I'm in town.Most of their menu items are named after real-life or fictional serial killers or movies/television series. The pizza tends to be on the thinner side which is what I prefer. I tried the Monster (similar to supreme pizza toppings) and the Red Dragon (a meat lover's dream)--half and half. Both times the pizzas were well made and delicious. They also serve calzones, sandwiches, paninis, and burgers with a few dessert options. If I didn't love pizza so much, I'd definitely explore their menu more."}, {"review_id": "4mVYN0fneDLRdpv62m4Dgw", "user_id": "MzLIqKufqHlZpkxeW9sKPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "A little rough on the outside, but killer on the inside.   Maybe one of the best spots in Tucson...

I did see one of the employees offering chairs to have everyone be able to sit together in the two seater tables, so that's always an option if you can't find seating.  Anything you try will be great."}, {"review_id": "5nuNCyNHxXmdpKHS8TGXfQ", "user_id": "3Ieo0maF7EPe6iFzUQ3Tcw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I really enjoyed this Serial Grillers.

After seeing the name pop up on Food Network, Forbes, and the Cooking Channel, I could not miss the opportunity to visit the infamous restaurant while visiting Tucson. Serial Grillers came about from two brothers who had the idea of doing something a little different with their favorite foods, which includes cheesesteaks, calzones and pizza. And different is definitely what they did. The restaurant is a little hole in the wall with no flashy signage. Upon walking in, the medium sized dining area has some cool wall art and a self serve soda station. After checking out the menu and consulting with the employees, I decided on the Hannibal cheesesteak. The Hannibal cheesesteak was delivered about ten minutes after ordering and it was worth the wait. Topped with ribeye, grilled onions, hot cherry peppers, sweet peppers, tomatoes, pickles and white american cheese, this sandwich was a sight for sore eyes. Although it sounds super spicy, it was actually the perfect amount of spicy and savory. The ribeye was tender and juicy, the hot cherry peppers and sweet peppers balanced one another out perfectly the the cheese was just the right amount. Each sandwich does come with either a choice of potato salad or coleslaw. I opted for the potato salad which was served in a little cup of starchy goodness. It was a little salty for my taste, but still super flavorful. If you are looking for a quick, tasty and affordable meal, this is the place for you. The cheesesteak was perfectly prepared, perfectly portioned and perfectly seasoned. Though I wish they opened one of these in LA, I fear that it would not be the same. Visiting Serial Grillers is a nice treat when visiting the area. The restaurant offers table service; you order your food at the register and take a number to your table where the food is delivered to you. There is free parking available for the restaurant (which is always a plus). I did not get to try the famous pizza, so that is next on my list!"}, {"review_id": "CXtt0oKQS6OgbFHtO_SR5w", "user_id": "5FJ_KlbPOrZajGYwmFoUkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Great food all around.
