So, if you're looking for a great Friday lunch place, check out the buffet."}, {"review_id": "krm1yuG2Z4DZo5Soi9yKLQ", "user_id": "D-pkR5exUeJQ6lfsAXD4Ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Five star dinner. Five star service. The spaghetti carbonara was authentic and delicious. Caesar salad was the best with a real homemade Caesar dressing. I enjoyed a delightful warm Hawaiian Bread pudding with gelato. And homemade truffles served with the check. I mention the service again because it truly was five-star."}, {"review_id": "l6Dkxd76WSVXSV_1759upg", "user_id": "PJR2tIV8KmKFt8k0oOT1Dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Our family absolutely loves this place!

It's fine dining in a strip mall. Food-excellent! Service-top notch! I had the Oso Buco for the first time, so tender it fell off the bone..and the flavor was delicious! Very well seasoned. The Mr got the chicken parm and he loved it.. chicken was tender and very flavorful. The fried mozzarella cheese app was so creamy and stringy..the best I've ever had....and the house salad was so yummy, loved the vinagrette. I would get it again and again. We will be back for sure very soon!"}, {"review_id": "EwMOalJdwf2YjN4uCj6Ydw", "user_id": "Nu2W73tHsJFqlngE_Pnh_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Love the new menu!  I had the duck confit & my wife had the cannelloni crepes, AMAZING!  Appetizer special was over the top.  The waitresses were absolute saints, having to deal with a difficult customer with a screaming kid for 30 minutes (must have been because it was Friday the 13th).  We absolutely love this place & would highly recommend it."}, {"review_id": "uLuqvI1BmXhuEVSprCnDCQ", "user_id": "sFKeyPHhB6R4URZXyrfXQg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "I'm very disappointed. Firstly, tables that were seated after us had their entrees before we even had bread. Almost two hours after arriving we finally received our food. Of course my order was incorrect so I had to sit and watch everyone eat their food. My food then came and everyone else had to sit and wait for me to eat. When the bill came I was charged full price for a horrible dining experience. I was completely blown away. I've never had a server mess up so terribly and still have the audacity to do that. I won't be dining there again."}, {"review_id": "RcoBFke72sRwnZyiHCBKow", "user_id": "-Oc28U4eSGEmW5-Rrgj7Yg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Very friendly staff, great cozy atmosphere.

I felt slightly under dressed but it might have been the time of night that we arrived. The server was nice and everyone was very attentive and tried to make sure that our experience there was a good one. It was cleanish. There was food on the salt shaker from a previous patron and things seemed dusty. The decorations were a little off and somewhat outdated. The flower vase had a Easter egg decoration that just looked to cheap for a nice place. The food was delicious my husband had the Lobster Mac and I had a chicken dish. We had an appetizer, 2 entrees, shared a dessert and a tea and Diet Coke and our bill was a little less than $70 before tip. I think we will go back and try it again someday."}, {"review_id": "bQuOHwS13tXcNBkKazSpOg", "user_id": "dkwkE2PYjOJrwqopi2WCjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "SO AHH-MAZING.

We ordered 3 appetizers, 1 salad and shared an entree. No room for dessert.Calamari - hubby loved it and he is a picky eater.Crab cakes - a lil small but i loved it. Perfecto.Bruschetta - delicious. I thought the toast was a lil soft but there was fresh mozz on it so understandable.House salad - yummy dressing and not over powering. Spring salad but lettuce was not bitter. Love the angel hair carrots.Frutti de Mare - only thing i didnt like about this dish was that it was too al dente for me. Maybe i shouldve requestrd spaghetti or angel hair. Otherwise sauce was fresh (maybe a lil too much wine) and I felt spoiled with all the full size seafood. Scallops and shrimp was huge. Loved it!Top that off with nice, friendly and attentive service. Romantic atmosphere. They could put in fresh flowers to add a nice touch. Husband had red wine. Our bill came to $69 + tip.Will have to come back to try other menu items and dessert!"}, {"review_id": "r0tSZDP3RE5eSNVQpYlxLg", "user_id": "Xusmju5FvvtvjS2cx5I1Zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/16/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Wow.

We came here because of the good reviews on Yelp. We were let down by the entire experience.  The service was terrible and slow. We waited quite a long time for our food and it was not even close to being busy. Finally, the food came and we were even more disappointed. I ordered the lasagna (in picture) and my wife ordered the Cannotelli Crepe. We both took only a few bites because the food was terrible. The food was luke warm to cool as if it had been sitting out, which explains the long wait. The couple behind us had been there before we arrived and still had not received their food when we left. I overheard them complaining to the waitress. I am hoping they were just on an \"off\" day by looking at these other reviews, but we will never be going back."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bella-vita-bistro-wichita-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
