Small, local business with fair prices and comforting taste that feels healthier than other restaurants. I always get the glass noodles and love their chicken lettuce wraps.

I saw the yelp reviews, stopped in forgetting that I've eaten here before, and then remember how unimpressive and overrated it is. I'm sorry, but the quality does not reflect the price (see the pic I posted of the \"salad\" I posted, which was basically taco lettuce). Ordered beef stir fry, which had very little beef. Def not deserving of the price or the 4 or 5 star reviews."}, {"review_id": "eZy0MqW070nbDTCNkgI-Og", "user_id": "Odfb3Q1l4w9UWp4XMl8Uvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2017", "text": "Always amazing to eat at! And they can even cater if you are vegetarian or vegan! Omg still thinking about my meal which was a spicy stir fry basil dish! And now craving for more! The crispy lettuce tofu cups were delicious too! Wish they had a vegan dessert but beggars can't be choosers! Overall very happy! Asian Pear Martini was great too !

I wanted to try it out since I had read so many mixed reviews. The place only had about 4 other tables at the time. When we arrived we walked through these thick dark wooden doors that has swirled glass panes. Very impressive right from the start. The decor was very nice. Lots of dark wood, stone wall, a calming 7 foot waterfall. Amber soft lighting. Interesting 3-top tables with a curved settee' on one side and two chairs diagonally on the other side. We got a table at the window and were waited on right away from a nice young man that got us waters with lemon and lit our table candle. The menus are big, thick, red, cardboard books and very professional. Just a shame you could hardly read it. Good thing we got there just before the sun totally went down or I would have had to use my flashlight app on my phone to read it. Which my friend said would be tacky, but how can I order if I can't see the menu descriptions. I think the waiter or manager would have gotten the hint though. I ended up getting the Singapore Street Noodles with pork and he ordered House fried rice with beef. Also ordered an appetizer of chicken dumplings with soy vinaigrette which were excellent. They (4) rest on top a bed of crisp iceberg lettuce and shredded carrot in a baby bamboo steamer that also has a light vinaigrette sweet sauce drizzled on the lettuce that leaves a trace on the bottom of the dumplings. Wonderful! Our food came out in very reasonable time and was presented on large bowl/plates. It was a shame it was so dark because I couldn't really pick out the pork from the egg, from the tomatoes until I held the table candle over the dish to see. The flavor was different and appealing, not like any flavor I had ever had. Just can't put my finger on it. The portion size seemed large until you really realized it was mostly the noodles and not overly abundant with meat and vegetables. His was the standard fried rice with carrots, peas, eggs, onion, and sliced beef. Again, mostly rice versus veggies and meat. Service was very good and attentive with water refills and take home boxes. The waiter brought the bill on a tray with two fortune rolls. They were hollow tubes of cookie with rolled up fortune papers inside. Very good! I could have eaten about 5 of those. Little details like that do distinguish a restaurant of this caliber from others. Yes, their prices are a little on the higher end but the experience and ambience and excellent service make up for that. I would definitely go back but make sure I have a mini flashlight in my pocket."}, {"review_id": "RDZMeYdhAncmvfmpHKTmKg", "user_id": "HcY7CFD5yRfNjvp2Sjl4mg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/24/2015", "text": "I am in love with this place. Fantastic atmosphere. It's dark and beautiful. Everything is presented beautifully. Some restaurants have focused on making wait times short that they forgot the art of cuisine. Everything is bound to be plated uniquely in a way to appease the eye as well as your appetite.

Some dishes we like, some we don't. This last time we went was pretty decent. The prices are a bit high here though, so we don't come too often.This time we got a Roti Canai for an appetizer, Drunken Noodles, and Korean Short Ribs.Roti Canai: This was unlike the traditional Roti Canai that I've had at a restaurant chain, Penang. I was a bit surprised how different it looked, but it tasted pretty good. They basically give you a pancake type of oily bread that you rip and dip into curry. They gave a good amount of curry, so we had some leftover after we finished our bread. So when our other two dishes and rice came, we basically ended up with a 3rd dish of some curry! Score!Drunk Noodles: This dish surprised me a bit too. I'm used to eating this at Thai restaurants with flat noodles, but it comes with small glass noodles. The taste was decent, but I kind of miss the larger flat noodles for this dish. Korean Short Ribs: This wasn't the best korean short ribs dish that we've had. The meat wasn't too sweet, so it didn't taste like Korean Short Ribs to me. On the plus side, they give a LOT of short ribs, so if you're here for quantity, this would be good.Atmosphere: They dim the lights really low here. I guess it's supposed to be romantic, but I usually like to see what I'm eating, so for me, it ruins the atmosphere a bit."}, {"review_id": "VP4oYlNhpQJuDEnykpGKww", "user_id": "k-IDH_V79SV4solx3DjUoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/14/2016", "text": "The food was out so quick and it was delicious!  The pear martini was crisp and delightful."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tantra-asian-bistro-davenport?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
