Tons and tons of local craft brews. I was especially drawn to the beers brewed right here in Wichita. I tried two pale ales and a stout which were all excellent.I went with the chips and queso for an appetizer. Honestly, I've had better queso and the chips were a little stale (maybe undercooked) but either way not really impressive.For my entree I went with the bartenders suggestion. I asked for something they were know for. Her suggestion: The Poutine Haystack which is an open faced burger, piled with fries, white cheese curds and beefy poutine gravy. Oh. My. Lord! So delicious!I've never had poutine but after tonight it will not be the last time I've had it.The service was outstanding!!"}, {"review_id": "WyTMlgT_Qu91nY4pI2D3rw", "user_id": "Mq1RS9LknKJGpX3fM5up-A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Average pub prices: the veggie burger was $12 with a side, the salads were $9-$10 before meat, sides run $2-$6. PROS: Very friendly staff. Fun atmosphere. Seems like a great hang out spot. Open later than other Wichita restaurants. Burgers are reportedly awesome (courtesy of my meat eating friend). Fun variety on the menu for omnivores (German sausage burger, for one!). Didn't rush us even though we arrived within an hour of closing.CONS: Veggie burger and salad were duds, so the healthier options don't seem up to par with the rest of their offerings."}, {"review_id": "JL4DUWE76uQprAgr5x_8Gg", "user_id": "pNx3lK_fv9KUCwl66joVow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "My wife and I came here on a co-workers recommendation. I was told The Anchor had good burgers, good beers, and a good atmosphere. I'm not really a drinker but I am a burger guy.  First impressions were good, very cool atmosphere that brings out the hipster in even the best of us. As a general rule when I go somewhere new I ask what the waiter recommends and order it. I was told The fried okra was good for a starter and the Butchers Grinder was a good burger. My wife got the pulled pork sandwich.  The fried okra was just ok. I'd not recommend it as a premier starter, especially for the price. My wife and I cut our sandwiches in half and shared. The smoked pulled pork sandwich was great! The pickles on there were very unique and gave a very nice punch to break up all that pork. The Butchers Grinder was one of the best simple hamburgers I've ever had a restaurant. Period. The meat was cooked to perfection and the toppings on the burger just added to the flavor of the burger. Yum. TLDR: I've had better service and better starters before but the sheer quality of the meat and how wonderfully they prepared it made up for any other shortcomings. 8/10 can confirm is good."}, {"review_id": "-TgA7GqSBkTJqYICOT4l4g", "user_id": "L_mmelYRBa4v7Hmh6jTkww", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "I have been to the Anchor 3 times and it's now time for the review, this review is based on the food.2 out of  3 Times has the fries been cold, not fresh for sure, the other time they were good.

Ever since then we have timed our trips so we would overnight in Wichita just so we could come back to The Anchor. The first couple times we were here we had wings and a burger. Obviously good because we came back but on our more recent visit the menu had expanded. Like a lot. We tried a little of everything and we liked everything we had. Like a lot. We had a salad and a bowl of chili as our pre game. I know it sounds boring but soup and salad when everything is fresh and crispy on the salad and then hot and melty on the chili is a win. The smoked chicken wings were our 2nd course. They were exactly what they sound like. True smoked wingies that were drowned in sauce after they were smoked. House made blue cheese was our dip. They didn't disappoint. The steak and frites were the highlight of our meal. For me anyway. Perfectly cooked mid rare strips of beef and thin crispy fries. Fat kids dream. Almost didn't share.Sadly no room for dessert. Unless Rumplemintz is a dessert. It is to me. We will be back."}, {"review_id": "CDfDzdQvOh_hUD7nToktDQ", "user_id": "1tpydgN_7-D4e7uc2iG9FQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/11/2017", "text": "I give The Anchor 5 stars for beer selection! We decided to stroll down Douglas after my friend got a tattoo. Lots of people were on the patio but we opted to get out of the heat and dine inside. We were seated instantly and I was amazed at the massive choice of different beers. Over half the menu are beer options and much of the beer is on tap which is really great. I decided on the draft Drumroll Unfiltered American Pale Ale. Infused with Pineapple, orange and grapefruit flavors, this was my first time trying it and I loved it (Odell Brewing in CO if you ever decide to look for it).Food is pretty decent. Ordered the club sandwich. Bacon was perfect but sandwich was a little dry. Didn't come with any dressings so had to request mayo. The fries are seasoned and extremely flavorful yet not too salty. Server was great, also."}, {"review_id": "W4s9Swr6DlZCqaey9wJ0Lg", "user_id": "w4C1NeVGfUhdB9yGPNI13g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "When I lived in Wichita, this was my go-to stop for a pilly cheese steak and truffle fries. Coming back in town after 5 years, things has changed. But this place remains the same. It was nice to go back to something familiar.I visit during an event night so the menu was limited. I had a club sandwich with a side of fries. The food was amazing as always but the service was better. We asked for a side of truffle aioli to use as a dipping sauce because it's so good, and they came out with a generous amount.I'm excited to visit back."}, {"review_id": "Pjgv4YogEovWe_qAi9yDSQ", "user_id": "9txO4_yIT_Q_m3yPy4fH1w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "I enjoyed the vibe inside of The Anchor. Right off the bat though the hostess wasn't the most pleasant I've met. She was somewhat rude about us not having our entire party there but it's okay I can look past it! We sat down and ordered and all was fine. This was my first time coming so I had not expectations. Apparently the skinny fries are very well known in the city but on this particular day, they were testing out thick fries and everybody in the place threw a fit. I didn't see one person that wasn't severely disappointed. Probably safe to say they should go back to what they're good at. I got the veggie burger and it was very yummy. No complains from me other than that the ratio of patty to bun was a bit off. There also wasn't a waitress around often so when I ran out of water I waited for quite a while to get a refill. With all of this said, I would go back to try a new burger and hopefully their famous fries!"}, {"review_id": "qcUNQaQnJ_dihgeBJm-6JA", "user_id": "GYUSwObx5jLLHiEx3UiQuQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I really liked the location and service, but the food wasn't too great. The exception: the Mac and cheese! Oh my goodness, it was delicious. We also tried truffle fries (extra crispy but really greasy), chips and salsa (salty, greasy, and good) black bean burger (good but the peepers were weird) and poutine haystack (basically just mediocre gravy taste). Nothing was gross, but nothing really stuck out.

I came here for my birthday last weekend and ordered a small sweet potato fries and cup of chili - fantastic! Also with a gin and tonic since they're so good. I can't remember what my friends ordered exactly but they each got two different sandwiches and drinks off the cocktail menu. No complaints from either of them so I can only assume they enjoyed their selections.Oh and I think this was the first time I ordered just a side of sweet potato fries by itself... it could be enough for a meal. Definitely a perfect appetizer choice to split amongst a group of friends. I had leftovers that I brought home and reheated the next day in my oven. Almost as good as fresh!"}, {"review_id": "GnGj6gu2kVLbCjdgx93Ivw", "user_id": "kha2JYM8TLnGgF9d4XOyTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Very nice people and fun atmosphere!

We are in town for the weekend and the ratings were so awesome we decided to stop and grab a bite to eat. The atmosphere is a millennial mecca and they have a great selection of burgers. My kiddo went with the Chili Chz Dawg and she really liked it, we also ordered the Midnight Marauder which was above average. We wanted to sub the supposedly drool-worthy truffle fries and completely expected an up-charge but they actually charge the full price of the appetizer, which is $8.00. Yep, you read that right. $8.00 to put some truffle oil and cheese on the fries you are already getting as a side to your $10-$15 sandwich and bring you a side of garlic aioli. (And the aioli tasted like mayonnaise and someone mentioning garlic.) The fries are super thin and a little too greasy for us, no one at our table was impressed but lots of people love them based on other comments we read. So we gave it a 3, very middle of the road and you probably won't be terribly disappointed.

Probably the best vs a lot of places. People here are great and the inviting atmosphere is just as good. I see a variety of people who come here to have a glass of beer and eat good food. I travel to different states and countries and I have not yet found a place or chef who makes such a spectacular fish and chips combination with a side of cole slaw. The only thing I think I noticed but did the price of the fish and chips go up! Correct me if I'm wrong. But that was kind of expensive. Not gonna mark it down for that for now.

I've never had one bad item from the menu and the selection of ever changing beers on tap is excellent. This place is good if you want to sit alone, go with friends, and best of yet go with family. I highly recommend the brat burger and the hell hath no fury if you are wanting to spice up your life !
