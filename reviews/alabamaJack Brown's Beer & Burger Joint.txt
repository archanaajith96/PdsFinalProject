My 2 youngest (11 and 13) have both chosen JB's for their birthday dinner with the family.The burgers look small but I swear it's like you've eaten 2 by the time you are done they are so filling! They all have a bit of a funky make up (cream cheese and pepper jack jelly for the win!) but you can get them without all of the \"odd\" fixings if you'd prefer an old fashion cheeseburger. Just don't ask for lettuce, tomato, etc... cuz you won't get any.Is there a better burger in town, some that might compare. Is there a better beer selection in town, debatable. Is there a better burger and beer joint in town, absolutely not!

If you're in the Lakeview area and are wanting a classic burger and fries joint with a cold beer, then head this way.

Wow what a gem of a place. We came in on a Sunday afternoon and it was great, laid back atmosphere, good music playing and they were busy but not over the top. We found a table by the window and ordered some really amazing burgers. They were moist and full of flavor. The different varieties were perfect. I had the Danny Laruso topped with cream cheese and jalapeño jelly. The tang and creaminess of the cream cheese mixed with the sweet heat of the jelly just played up the juiciness of the burger and went so well with the meat. We also ordered the Chiflet which my daughter loved since the egg made an almost gravy for her burger. My husband ordered the Greg Brady heaped with macaroni & cheese and he added bacon to it. We had to have an order of the sweet potato and regular fries. They have this incredible homemade sauce that just goes well with everything. We ate in total silence since everything was so good. We weren't too willing to share our burgers with each other as well. So definitely give them a try. It's a great little spot situated in a fun area"}, {"review_id": "_4nhW0mlr36LOERdpnpJbA", "user_id": "G1h1gHD9q31P4b-sIBoz6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "I really liked this place, it reminds me of my college years, although, times have changed and things are more sophisticated (and pricier): craft beer and craft burgers. My brother and I were checking out breweries, and we just needed a place to rest and pick up something to eat. He wanted burgers, so we headed to this place. I was hoping for a veggie burger on the menu, but alas, no veggie option. So I ordered the Danny Larusso (I guess he is Jack Brown's buddy or a celebrity in these lands), and my brother ordered a Chiflet. The burgers are a good size, you do not need to dislocate your jaw, but at the same time, you could easily eat two burgers, if you are hungry. But there are fries and stuff, so make sure to order a side. My Danny Larusso was good, with the jalapeño jam and cream cheese.Only thing I did not like was the *no outside food* policy, it bothered me to see people get turned around. Then again, people bringing food to restaurants may be a Birmingham thing, I don't know...Beer selection is tops. Music is awesome. Service is good.

I actually wasn't that excited to come to this place, as I am not a big burger person. But, it really exceeded my expectations. We came here on a Saturday night and it was very crowded. The only seats that were available was a small area at a bar in the outdoor seating area. We opted to sit there so we wouldn't have to wait. The outdoor patio area is really nice and feels kinda like a beer garden. They have a large craft beer menu. I am also not a beer person, but I was able to find something I liked. I forget the name of what I ended up having but it was something raspberry flavored and did not taste like beer (My mom just told me it is \"rasberry crabbies\"). One thing that sucks is that they don't have any non alcoholic drinks on their menu so I was forced to try and find a beer. They need to get a fountain drink machine or something! For my meal, I ended up ordering the Greg Brady burger. The Greg Brady has mac & cheese and potato chips on it. I wasn't sure if this would be too much for me, but I ended up loving it. I love that their burgers aren't huge, I hate when burgers just taste like a huge meatball which is not the case with these. I also got fries to go with it which were decent.  Service was great, despite being busy our waitress was very attentive and seemed to know a lot about the menu selections. I will definitely come back again, next time I am going to have to try the fried oreos!"}, {"review_id": "Y0PrP3feXSJarufoRoKq3A", "user_id": "3pD0s1WJv6418a4PF0ByWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "One of Bham's best burger spots. They offer a casual atmosphere; think \"dive bar\" with a hipster twist. The fun, eclectic mix of tunes playing in the background also serves to amp up the experience.   The burgers are not quite as large as some of the other burger spots in the city, but what some might say they lack in size, they make up for in taste. The burgers are flavorful, served on warm, soft buns, and complimented with fun, unique toppings. I enjoy the chifilet (applewood smoked bacon, egg, & cheese burger) and the Danny Laruso (topped with cream cheese and Jalapeño jelly). Fries are available a la carte. I prefer the sweet potato over the regular, crinkle cut. But both compliment the burgers nicely. Excellent beer selection.

They have locations in Virginia, Tennessee and one in Alabama which is the one I visited in Birmingham. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they have a Nashville location because I loved this place and want more! We came on a Sunday night and it was packed. We walked into this dimly lit restaurant and I first noticed some of the decor and decorations. They have a bunch of vintage signs hanging and their were bras hanging from one of the lighting fixtures, Coyote-Ugly style. Classy? Certainly not. But it is a fun vibe and it seems that a lot of college students frequent this place. The downstairs area has a bar then a few tables that seat 4 people. The upstairs has a patio with another bar and additional seating. We snagged a table and our waitress came to take our beer order first. Their beer menu has a ton of bottles/cans and a few on draft. I went with a local brew from the Good People Brewing Company called the Bearded Lady. It was slightly hoppy as a pale wheat ale but I really liked it. Their food menu is exclusively burgers except for a grilled cheese--so vegetarians/vegans should probably steer clear of this place. Their menu states that their burgers are 100% wagyu beef (American-style Kobe beef) and are prepared simple. The menu certainly isn't huge but they have some really unique toppings for their burgers. My friend is a huge fan of the Jack on Piggy Back which is a burger topped with a split hot dog, jalapenos and cheese. That blew my mind a bit so I went with the more subdued option of the Cowboy which was barbecue sauce, bacon and cheddar cheese. The burgers aren't huge so one of my guy friends actually ordered two. The fries are crinkle-cut which are delicious as well and they serve it with a side of some sort of aioli which is a yummy dipping sauce. Service was great, food and beer was excellent and the atmosphere is laid-back. I'm already craving another burger!"}, {"review_id": "vJz_a_XCN7pmBvI2OaNwEA", "user_id": "xk98Fe85EduorPMwOlgzrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Great little eclectic bar.

Its because these damn undersized 5oz. Wagyu burgers are always, and I mean always overcooked. This is my favorite place to hang out downtown, I always get a burger, and it always disappoints. You could bring in a plain 1/4 Pounder and throw the same toppings on it, and voo-ah-lah...you got an authentic Jack Brown's burger. This whole Wagyu thing is a waste if the customers never see the benefit. And if you're roaming around and happen to get a glimpse of their grill, avert your eyes... you don't want to see whats going on in that kitchen. 3 1/2 stars Now on the plus side, the bar is very chill, the bartenders extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and the beer selection is amazing.
