To start with the place is decorated amazingly!  The vibe this place gives off is awesome.  And the food was great. I ordered the Idaho trout, which came with broccoli and some rice. I would recommend trying it, everything on the plate was flavored perfectly. I also tried one of their specialty huckleberry drinks which I would also recommend trying it. Only con about Barbacoa is that it is a little pricy.But overall with how delicious the food is, and the vibe this place gives up I would recommend going. You will not be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "zAWWTw8nKFLSpzAybbVVqQ", "user_id": "JYlK_rlc1mfi4iIz1E_uiQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Here is what happened ordered we drinks they got one drink wrong. We ordered two appetizers one came out in about 15 minutes the second didn't come out  so we asked our server about he blamed the kitchen and the chef. And then said he thought we ordered the appetizer as an entree. Drinks weren't refilled, additional drinks weren't able to be ordered. A table that came in a half our group was served their meals. So we had to ask about our meals. An hour after we ordered our food came, food wasn't that  bad nor was it that good. I would give it a C+. The assistant manager brought some of the food and was pleasant and professional. He asked my friend what she wanted to drink, and she asked for a mojito, which came to the table about ten minutes later. The comped one appetizer which was nice of them.Then the check comes and we go to pay and when the credit cards are brought back one of the cards isn't even from our party. In summary the manager was the only decent part of this experience."}, {"review_id": "Bpn4gM4w0-t93IyUs2j20A", "user_id": "Ecct9zohQrsp6ZsT7NbY3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "impeccable fine diningI made my 2nd visit here last Fri. for a girls' night out.  I made a reservation for 4pm, as the place is HOPPING, for very good reason. Here they have buy-one-get-one-free drinks during Happy Hour, with a lengthy drink menu to please nearly all drinkers' palates, food that will bring you to your knees with flavor, texture, presentation, and style, and star service.The artwork and interior design here might be described as modern goth-edgy meets industrial tasteful color with high style and glamour, akin to what you might find in San Francisco, LA, Miami, or Boston.  Eye candy is everywhere you rest your dilated pupils. I want that interior designer to decorate my house, but it is out of my budget, ha! Wear your sexy shoes and outfits here.We had many different waiters on this occasion, which marked 2 birthdays for our group.  The guacamole is a real stand-out and a specialist prepares it fresh at your table, to your preferred heat level. The chips are decadent, so go easy and be sure to eat light a few meals before your trip here and get in some HIIT workouts beforehand, so you can indulge with full abandon.Deciding what to order is a happy conundrum.  The seafood here is wonderfully tasty.  A few stand-out menu items are the juicy chicken wing 'n polenta appetizer with live cooking flames for heating, the yellow-tail tuna appetizer, and the salmon dishes.  I can't wait to try the filet mignon with lobster tail next time! Do not come here without a reservation, and as others have said, you may need to wait a bit even with one.  If you come for HH, get here right when they open or a bit before, lest you are left with no choice but to stand around in a sardine-packed bar area and get claustrophic, which is what happened the first time I came here. I'll leave that for the Manhattan bars, not for Boise.Our servers were highly attentive and our water glasses (half regular water, half sparkling for me, thank you) were always full.  The mini ice-sculpture-holder for some of the cocktails can make for a messy drinking experience, so order it without the ice holder if you have a need for no-nonsense thirst-quenching.Bring your out-of-town guests here for an unforgettable experience. Bring your lover here for a delightful first act.  Bring your family here for a lovely time."}, {"review_id": "xDCPB2Y1qKwsdMzCW3YI4Q", "user_id": "jCF2lKTngLwbUt1dVg08nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "We came here to celebrate and we wanted to splurge on a nice dinner. I must say this was one of the best meals I have ever had. This was our second time at Barbacoa but we enjoyed our selections much better the second time around. We started off with the grilled octopus, flatbread and the table-side guacamole. The octopus was incredibly tender and flavorful, the flatbread was just okay but it was basically bread with some cheese. The  guacamole is very good and they let you chose how spicy you want it. For the main course I got the ribeye on the hot rock, a lobster tail and Mac and cheese as my side. I must say this was the best steak I have ever had. So tender and juicy. I suggest ordering it more rare than you like it since it is sitting on a sizzling rock. They pour some flaming cognac sauce over it which makes for quite a show. The lobster tail was delicious as well and cooked to perfection. My wife ordered the Filet Mignon Gorgonzola pasta and it was extremely flavorful and a very generous portion. For dessert we got the half order of the fried ice cream and it was the perfect finish to the meal. We did not have anymore room but we made it work! They were delicious. I wouldn't consider \"fried\" but more coated in a cinnamon cereal type crust. Tasted like a churro or horchata. We also had quite a few drinks. They have a great selection of whiskey and wine. Their mixed drinks are good as well. Yes, we went a little bit crazy ordering and spent a couple weeks worth of grocery money but it was worth it! Can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "V4YQZ_za3mE6b4UuP_rOhg", "user_id": "6dbpUje4-0Ksxk6I0heaPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "2nd time here, truly one of my most favorite places in the country. Certainly most unique dining experience. The building is seriously amazing and the food is as incredible. The hot stone steak is the best way I've eaten a filet and the cognac sauce is pretty fabulous. The sides are super, the artichoke fritters as a side are pretty big portion. The jalapeño green chili rice spot on. My wife's special halibut and risotto was the best I've had anywhere. The \"I'm your huckleberry\" cocktail was really nice, fresh and cold. The fried ice cream really good the eclairs were presented really cool. This place is so great, I want to come back and try the items on the menu that are not steak. I mean for a place like this to have chicken pot pie on the menu it must be incredible"}, {"review_id": "3PzsqwkhEoJg3Dzun59m-g", "user_id": "Mqfhw5xBXGRwJnYjWXVoYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Was here last weekend and LOVED it. First of all, it is worth coming just to see how intricately the place is decorated. So many things to look at, the whole building is a work of art. Definitely try to go take a peek at the VIP room- it's beautiful. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. Not only was the food artfully made and delicious, but the plating and the dishes were super inventive. This is a great place to go to for a high-end, fun experience.

Spendy for some items if you are wanting to celebrate and plenty of smaller choices for a regular night. Great bar menu. Excellent service... I can't say enough to highlight how great this place is.

They gave me a sample of a red Conundrum wine and it was the best red wine I'd ever had. So, I had a glass of that with my meal as well. My favorite appetizer is definitely the table-side Guacamole! They also have a cheese bread that's super yummy. I've spent many moments reading over their menu, but I'm always a sucker for their hot rock steak. I love all the side options as well, although I had a not-so-good experience with the garlic mashed potatoes (they were BAD) so I got the Mac N Cheese this time and it was amazing.

I recently took some visiting family members these for dinner on Christmas eve. Everyone really enjoyed their experience. And that is what it is, an experience. It is much more than just eating dinner. As you walk in , you get the feeling you are entering a museum, or art gallery. Beautiful sculptures, paintings, and other interesting pieces.As for the food. It is really about the presentation (not that the food is an after thought, it is good !). All of the dishes are visually entertaining, as well as good. When you order a steak, you can have it served on a 500-600 degree flat rock ( i added a video a few days ago of this).. They then pour a cognac sauce over the top (flambe) . The drinks are good as well, and the week day happy hour is great also. The only drawback is it can be a little pricey, but for a special occasion, it is a great choice."}, {"review_id": "vKEqcgRooS6y6ZUCUUVzRQ", "user_id": "6jwzAVnq-0QeHhFZzO4Txw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "If you visit Boise . . .

From 4-5pm, they only serve from the app menu.  After that, you can order off the regular dinner menu, even if you're sitting in the open seating happy hour area.  Thurs-Sun, I recommend you come before 4:30 to get a good seat for happy hour.  It gets a little crazy after that.  And if you want to go for dinner and sit in the regular part of the restaurant, it's almost impossible without reservations."}, {"review_id": "516_tEH6K-8Y8gRgBWdoQQ", "user_id": "sEL-4lDY1R7wETDGKehOYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Oh my!
