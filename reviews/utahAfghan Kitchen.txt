I don't usually order chicken but I do here. I get the mixed kebab plate which 1/2 rice only because I don't like to waste any thing. I've had the same food from similar restaurants from Mazza to bet Chicken and rib they're not even close to as good. In fact take my advice here don't even try them you will be disappointed.  The service is hands on the space is beautiful and nice place to take a date or just a friend that yoI want to impress with you savvy skills.    The bathroom was very clean."}, {"review_id": "FyGJL4zpQKsy6XDVoVks2A", "user_id": "AFF8CHuMqJpZ_U3uEA8nzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Really good food, fast service we arrived at 6:15 and were seated right away.

This was my first time trying Afghanistan food and I loved every bite! I ordered a Mango Lassi for a drink. It was very creamy, semi-sweet and thick. As for a meal I ordered the Kabuli Palow w/ lamb. Its an Afghan traditional dish and the flavor in the dish is magnificent! I also ordered a side of the Afghan Naan and the portion I received was huge! I would recommend this place to anyone that is open to trying other culture's food and embracing their tradition."}, {"review_id": "3BpvY9AnSNBtsY3zkUWFaw", "user_id": "CmvCVTWMs20ATsNAiu33_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I don't really want to update but rather I want reiterate how f***ing amazing this place is!

Food is so favorable and the meat, the meat is so tender, I dont know how they do it, and portions are generous. My only complaint which really is a BIG one is it was a bit dirty inside. Walked in and my feet immediately stuck to the floor because it was sticky, sat at the front table where the blinds had dust and bugs layered on them. If that wasnt bad enough our water had a ton of floaties, and I'm pretty sure they have a bug zapper right by the front counter (at least it looks like a bug zapper to me). The back looked really nice buy dark so that makes me hesitant to sit back in filth that is hiding.  The staff was nice and has good recommendations but really I dont think you could choose anything bad here. I would definitely order food from here again but it would have to be take out."}, {"review_id": "56_y3mYb7FSyH50H6Aw_hw", "user_id": "tAa8pqbeg3fT44XJfVO0vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "My dining experience here was sublime. Every single thing I tasted was delicious. The menu is fairly simple, which I can appreciate since I think the focus is on quality over quantity in regards to menu offerings. We ordered both appetizers which I strongly recommend doing.The Bulani had a nice potato filling and was a perfect way to try the spicy condiments, the sweet chutney sauce and the tzatziki sauce. I personally loved mixing the tzatziki with the mild chili sauce, it was the perfect mix of spicy and tangy. The mantu appetizer was equally delicious with a really nice presentation.For my entree I ordered the mixed kabob. I think everyone should order this if you're coming for the first time because you get to taste two really flavorful and juicy meats and you'll know which you should order the next time you come in (there will probably be a second time, since the food here was sooo good). I thought the rice was cooked perfectly and while not strong in flavor, it complemented the meat very well. I also loved the simple cucumber salad which tasted super fresh and just added a nice textural element to the meal. The service was also very pleasant, and the restaurant was clean with a nice relaxing atmosphere.It's important to support local business, especially ones like Afghan kitchen that make unique, and delicious food. I will definitely be coming back with my family. Thank you yelp for the amazing find!"}, {"review_id": "tN00az7bAhQB5NSpYOKHNw", "user_id": "bOl7m4puZIXTL5E-Z4ReBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Came here for lunch during work, they had great service. It's the best hidden gem I've found. I called ahead for take out and the person who answered was super polite. She was very helpful in helping me make my decision as well.When I got there the decor was really great. There are tables available but also a bar for you to sit at. There wasn't a greeter when I was there so I went to the bar to pick up my food. The guy behind the bar was really busy keeping the place clean, so he was surprise when I got his attention. My food was sitting there ready for me to pick up and he was very quick in getting me charged and ready to go. I ordered the kabob dish. I got a chicken and beef kabob. The chicken kabob was delicious and filled with flavor. The chicken wasn't dried which was fantastic for me. The beef kabob was also really good. It was very moist and flavorful. The food came with a side of rice and the pickled vegetables. The rice was very good. They added plenty of flavor to it. I just love this entire plate and how delicious it was. Best part...it wasn't covered with grease.

Everything is fresh, cooked perfectly, is nicely spiced, and prepared with a dash of love that comes through in every bite. Seriously, the food here is very, very good.The space itself is no frills, but it has definitely received a makeover since the Bosna days (the last restaurant that was located in this space) and seems clean enough. The music is a nice touch, but was perhaps a tad loud for me on my last visit. But in the end, that's a small thing for the homemade delights that you'll find here.

Must get !! Super savory, perfectly spiced, and amazingly tender. Chicken was perfectly cooked. Better than most kabobs I've ever tried.Kabuli Palow (lamb) - rice was perfectly seasoned with spices and portioned with beef and carrot. Complemented with a side salad and a roasted eggplant tomato combo. All were delicious individually and together. This is their most popular dish for a reason. Mantu - my best comparison of this appetizer is to dumplings. The flour wrap is made super thin to not mask all the wonderful flavors. My favorite part is the yogurt base. Garlic Naan - crispy along the edges, not overly thick, lightly seasoned with garlic. Definitely a must to soak up all the extra sauces in the other dishes. The ladies that worked there were super helpful and very attentive. They introduced us to their special sauces; in which I recommend everyone try to complement their meal. Overall we will definitely come again !!"}, {"review_id": "Q5Td35mfO9V-eJEI6EMqrw", "user_id": "c9-Ty7XIB4p3CSPB9QIHiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Wow! This was my first time eating Afghan food. Definitely think that this place is a really good place for trying it out. Everything was delicious and very flavorful. We ended up buying both of the available appetizers (1 was a potato mix in a pita, the other was a dumpling that had weird spices). Both were very good. For entrees, we ordered the first lamb dish, eggplant, and the lamb kabob. We also got the regular naan and the garlic naan as a side. Everything was amazing. My favorite out of all of these dishes? Definitely the potato appetizer. It's like a cross between an pierogi and a quesadilla. :)The icing on this cake is the service. Never have I had more personable service where the waiter personally tells me everything she loves on the menu since we hadn't had Afghan food before and didn't know where to start! She spent a good 5-10 minutes carefully pointing out her favorites and sincerely checked if we liked it. We felt very welcomed there and felt no trouble navigating a new cuisine.Bottom line: Afghan food is yummy...and this place is a great place to try it out! Trust me as I say, we'll be back. :)"}, {"review_id": "3FeN-IkEOwD25A9T8Wfhjg", "user_id": "Yz1zPtv17UgveFOsioxGKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "It's cold and snowy outside. I didn't want to cook a meal at home and did not want crappy fast food. I wanted something \"homemade\" and flavorful. I read the reviews from Afghan Kitchen and decided to try it. However, didn't want to change and wait. We noticed you could place an order. I called in my order for 2 mix kebab plates. They said it would take 30 minutes. My order was ready at the time they said. Got off the warm car with comfy clothes, paid and less than 5 minutes I was back to my car. When we arrived home, the plates were still warm. The food was delicious. The kebab plate comes with rice and a cucumber salad. It has a chicken and beef kabob with a yogurt and mint sauce. The meat was grilled perfectly and super tender.
