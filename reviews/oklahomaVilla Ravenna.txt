They have a large menu, but everything has been good that we've ordered. The special for the night was carbonara pasta with seafood and lobster. They were generous with their portions of scallop and lobster so that was good. The seafood pasta was tasty. We got the Escargot-- tasty. The grilled pear appetizer was interesting. The Mozzarella with rolled prosciutto and tomatoes was refreshing. Still looking forward to coming back and trying their other dishes."}, {"review_id": "OkCi-g9ZEmGOI9usR_xieg", "user_id": "CUPWTnODnEULjRjinwpOkw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Upon arriving, I noticed the front of house staff was all kinds of confused.Hostess and servers double seating customers, the hostess stand left empty for long periods of time, people being ignored, stuff like that.I got there a little before my date so when I was offered a table I took it because, who knows if I'd have ever been seated before 10pm.Once seated it got really funny, really fast.The kid that brought out the water/bread OBVIOUSLY didn't want to be there.Like, at all.I'm sure he's good at what he does, but he made it clear he'd rather be elsewhere.The waiter, nice as he was, was a \"close talker\".He got RIGHT UP in our faces to take our order.It was both frightening, and hilarious.Besides the, uhm, \"distracted\" service the food itself was fantastic.My date and I both got the Fettuccine Alfredo with Scallops, Lobster, and Shrimp.Heaven.It was pure heaven.We discovered that if you wanted another drink, it was better to order 2 at a time because the bar is slow.So...service...meh.Drinks, good ,but take too long.Food, delicious.You should go, but don't expect the staff to really care if you're there or not."}, {"review_id": "xj0VqQfX0pamdOPnhvpk-w", "user_id": "mzLM08IyZKOhJMFiUBg2Bg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "We called to request our reservations for four at 7 pm. Upon arrival we had to wait several minutes for someone to arrive at the front to seat us. The lady jogged into place when she saw us waiting. We were taken over the hill and thought the woods-wait -we were taken deep into the building, made almost a u-turn and headed back to the front to a room in which we were alone. The room was cold, I never took my coat off and dark. Even with the table light I had to use the flashlight on my cell phone. Okay this is where the complaining ended!We were served bread. It had butter and basil. There was olive oil with spices to dip but that was not needed. It was divine. We are three baskets of bread. Appetizers ordered included Caesar salad (good but not earth shattering), escargot (incredible) and roasted pears with Gorgonzola on a bed a spinach (the heavens opened and Angels sang). Main courses we dined on were Lasagna Bolognese, Fettuccini Carbonara, and Cheese Ravioli. All three were quite tasty and made with homemade pasta which was delightful. The wait staff were attentive and even brought a complimentary cannoli for the birthday girl. We will be returning-soon!"}, {"review_id": "7hocK3wzSbt_5QiEB2vyGQ", "user_id": "NsDbw_IeHbOCAEPNDBWBaQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "To fully appreciate this update and the lowered rating, I implore that you read prior review. Especially the last paragraph. Once, I can forgive. Twice, I'm calling it Bait & Switch. And unforgivable. Last Friday we made reservations to belatedly celebrate our anniversary. I had been reviewing recent Yelps and noted there seemed to a problem w/ waitresses pushing red wine. Yet, I was surprised to find my Chardonnay self in that very situation. I had the BTG red wine list promptly presented. I said I drink white wine so, hesitantly, it was handed over. As before, I wasn't impressed and asked for the electronic version which had not been offered. Begrudgingly, she retrieved it. Indeed, it was skimpier than prior visit. However there were two Chardonnays (same label, mind you) with which I was familiar, one being from the Russian River Valley (remember, I have my sommelier pin). Alas, it was $15 more expensive than the other. I just couldn't justify $15! So I ordered the less expensive. This is where it gets reminiscent of prior review, last paragraph. She returned w/ a bottle of wine sunken in an ice bucket. Procured the one glass, for me, & moved the bucket nearer to me. She started to open the bottle secreted in the bucket. WHAT? I had to ASK , \"Can I **see** the bottle?\" Thoroughly shocked at her underhanded maneuver. She was just going to open it & charge me! I said, \"I'd love that bottle of wine if you intend to charge me the same **as the one I ordered**.\" To which she said, \"That's not my call.\" So I implored that she find out. She came back and said, \"That's the only bottle we have.\" I asked for the electronic list again. She handed me the BTG list, and I said I liked the BTB list better. She said it had not been updated & \"we're not going through that again\", are we?Such superb customer service here. Lied to twice. I took the BTG list again and she disappeared. My non drinking hubby was being extremely patient but said my wine at home was better. 1/2 hr in, no wine, no food, no waitress. People arriving way after us were being served. When she deemed to swing by at last I asked for a sample of Chard I'd swear I'd had before. It was awful. Way sweet, had no notes of Chard. Told hubby I had no idea what they'd poured. So, when she showed up again, I gave up & ordered Stag's Leap @ $15 a glass. Meh. People who came in after us had food before we'd even heard the \"specials\", which oddly always seem to be the same. . . Love that prosciutto/burrata/balsamic app! But when it was served, our menus had not even been removed. Not as pretty this time, sloppier presentation, not as much pesto as before, verified by prior customer pix. But we were so hungry we licked the plate clean. The bread they serve is chewy, spicy, satisfying. The food is good and somehow they manage to serve pasta HOT. Hot food is good. The portions are rather large; everyone leaves w/ go boxes & I expect that's a Tulsa draw from the size of many of the patrons.  Consistently busy, Turning tables. Noisy kids in the bar when we left at 8:00. Hubby said of our waitress, \"She doesn't want to be here tonite.\" Would you? When products aren't available and you're asked to cheat the customers?"}, {"review_id": "2TGBwa2a-pM-L1oybqvO5Q", "user_id": "cOJ22wX5avdUQJc69kmJ1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "My husband and I have been coming here since they first opened. We love the romantic atmosphere and unique Northern Italian food. Some of our favorite dishes are Fettuccine Alfredo, Calamari, Sea Scallops, and Melanzane alla Parmigiana (eggplant). It is pricey but we feel it is worth it for the unique atmosphere, service, and flavors. We really like the owner too, he always says hi and visits with us.

We came here right after work on a Wednesday night and we were there pretty early so the place wasn't filled up yet. I would definitely classify Villa Ravenna as a fine dining restaurant and reserve coming here normally for special occasions or dates (which you can do online); this a great place to come for a date because of the romantic ambiance. White table cloths topped with candles and tiny flower vases adorned the dining room and the dim lighting and fireplace add a unique feel. This might be a silly thing to use to gauge a place, but in my books anywhere they serve water in a goblet instead of glass you know it's going to be great (and fancy).I was impressed with the wine selection, but ultimately settled on trying the limoncello mule because they make their own limoncello in house. When in doubt, I usually go with trying the house specialty because there's usually a reason they're known for it. My dining partner had the house Moscato and she said it was delicious. Depending on what I was having for my meal or what circumstance I was here (since we were here on a work night we kept it to one drink) I would definitely have to try some of the other specialty cocktails or wines on the menu.The service did not disappoint which I was nervous about because I'd read other reviews before coming in and a few of them mentioned the service not being 100%. Perhaps these reviews were from an older experience and they have improved or perhaps they were from a super busy weekend night and a slightly impatient patron. Either way, I was impressed with the service and consider it to be above average even for fine dining.To start the meal, we had the lumache (escargot) and it did not disappoint. It was the first time I've ever had escargot and I really enjoyed it; it's pretty hard to go wrong when you cook something in garlic, parsley, and butter and serve it with bread. Aside from the bread accompanying our appetizer, I must say they have really perfected the pre-meal garlic bread here. If you aren't a fan of garlic you may want to skip it, but for me it had just the right amount of butter, garlic, and spices.For dinner, I had fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken. This is my go to dish at most Italian restaurants, especially the first time I go, and the chicken alfredo at Villa Ravenna was truly top notch with a creamy sauce that was rich and tasty but somehow still fairly light. The serving size was just enough (some places bring you practically a serving platter full of pasta to overcompensate for low quality) and it was easily evident the pasta was made fresh in house as was the sauce.I would have been too full to have dessert on my own, but my co-worker ordered the creme brulee and shared a few bites with me. The creme brulee was standard and good and a pretty large portion but it wasn't the best I've ever had or anything. I will definitely be back to taste more items on the menu here and perhaps for a date since the romantic ambiance sets the perfect backdrop."}, {"review_id": "L_oveM9FDuKWA9wbdkddPw", "user_id": "I0olPBJ7qgCS6Tb1gvztCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "We went for a large (20+) family dinner and had a private room.  There was a special menu and pre-ordered wine flowed freely--both were superb.Wait staff was very attentive and atmosphere galore!  The pasta, seafood and osso bucco all got rave reviews.  Will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "GoRCPdWpLBL0Wf4SQALeRg", "user_id": "aC3Dl43gPx7GTvUGHBz1Dg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Four of us went for dinner the other night and had a terrible experience.

When one of us complained about the long wait our waiter became very unfriendly and dropped the plates down as he was serving us.

I was pleased with the food, atmosphere and service. The wine selections are plentiful, but on the $$$ side. Wine by the glass started at $11, which for Tulsa is steep.
