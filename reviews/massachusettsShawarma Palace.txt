As many reviews said, the owner was so nice when I walked in. I ordered a falafel plate with mujdara. The owner gave me a free falafel to taste as I waited and it was great. Very flavorful. The restaurant itself is small with a few tables but I was taking my food to go anyway (I was also the only customer at the time). The food came out quickly and was so inexpensive for the amount of food I got. With the falafel plate, I got four falafels, mujdara (lentil, rice mix), salad, baba ganoush, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita.  Everything was amazing. Cooked to perfection and great flavors. The garlic sauce was very strong but I was warned about this ahead of time and I loved it. I only mention it here because some people may not enjoy the strength. I will definitely be returning to Shawarma Palace."}, {"review_id": "XnFJsLN0ObTueLVVUTUcSQ", "user_id": "FbxIMGmubYW5ukS1IiPjpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Good fresh food made by the family that owns it. They are all very nice. They food is made fresh from scratch, nothing comes out of a box. Everything has great flavor.

The food was good, but nothing exceptional. Service was nice but not as quick as some of the reviews led us to believe. If I lived or worked near here I would eat here again, it was good and fairly priced, but not a place I'd go out of my way for."}, {"review_id": "wYJ7NsMRk2otpb3DF0dJhA", "user_id": "PMUc917oC2uxWm1bJmAAjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I went to this place on a whim.

If you think that food tastes better when it's made by family members comically arguing with one another in an amusingly small kitchen, you should eat here. If you are human and you like to eat food sometimes, then you should eat here. You can stop searching. This is the best lunch place walking distance of city hall. PS. I just had lunch here and I will probably smell like garlic till next Tuesday."}, {"review_id": "gxMMfxSdS4JLQEyitzu5SQ", "user_id": "gOd3Ds_DY0O8HKjvd4ALWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Great tasting food for reasonable cost.  The grilled veggie wrap is my current fav.  Owner and son are very welcoming."}, {"review_id": "Y5mJchSBe3VT-HK3pB8xdg", "user_id": "sukidYDX-0TLUgb5E0q81Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Love going on here food is always delicious and at a great price.

Everything here is fresh and delicious, and the family that owns it is so nice and welcoming to everyone. Not to mention I can get totally stuffed here for lunch for right around $5.

It surely can if it's made fresh for u.. Yes and that's exactly what they do at Shawarma Palace!! A family owned small, cosy place with a no frills menu and lip smacking food. If you like Mediterranean food then this place has some authentic dishes to choose from. We were just 2 of us and we had a shawarma plate and a shawarma salad which was both filling and fresh tasting. Their garlic paste was very unique and I loved the flavor it bought along.

Crunchy, warm, interesting flavors - I don't even know exactly what was in this sandwich but it was delicious. I recommend you come here if you're open to trying something a little different, as well as if your looking for something quick near downtown. Parking is nonexistent, except for metered street spots. The two employees I could see were personable, they knew most of the customers by name as they walked in and gave us free baklava! What a tasty surprise! I could find myself craving their food easily, and I have no doubt I will become a regular myself"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/shawarma-palace-worcester?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
