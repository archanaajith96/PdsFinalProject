The bacon was good but the shrimp were so well done they were like beef jerky.  The only good item was the rolled chicken tacos which were plentiful and good.  No drinks, and a total price well over $50. Before tip.  I can't even give 2 stars as the prices are inappropriate for mediocre food in a dreadful setting. Why does yelp have so many positive reviews? Please think twice before going as there are so many good Mexican options in Salem."}, {"review_id": "plnOTsXhrYQandf5Ak-FEA", "user_id": "ZAXuGSDsAWdST1uVC1F8XQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "After going over a few options on Yelp, my family and I decided to head to this place since the reviews were so great and honestly I'm always down for some Mexican food. Parking was a bit difficult and the lot was covered in trash.  This was definitely a hole in the wall type place.  My family didn't want to go in but I told them looks can be deceiving and that we needed to at least give it a try.  We go in and the atmosphere was less than spectacular.  The tables were oddly arranged and the colors threw me off.  Again, looks can be deceiving.  We were seated right away and after a couple minutes our drink orders were in.  My brother ordered a mango margarita and to his great disappointment got something that looked like a mango margarita but tasted like Vicks cough syrup.  Honest to god, we sat there trying to figure out what in a margarita would taste like that for the rest of our short visit there.  The worst part... the part that made me take the time to write up this review.  We got our food, my mom got the enchiladas and got some liquidy enchilada soup thing, just waaay too much sauce and cheese.  My brother got a cheese quesadilla and it looked great, he said he enjoyed it as well.  I got the burrito with shredded chicken and while it tasted really good... the cockroach I pulled out of my mouth ruined the entire experience. I complained to the waitress who was actually standing at our table when I pulled it out of my mouth, she went off to grab the cook without saying anything.  The cook comes to the table and sees the cockroach. -\"Sometimes they come in on the lettuce, it happens\".- Is what he said to me. I was two seconds from vomiting on the table.  This was a few days ago and I still can't get the crunch feeling out of my mouth.  I have a hard time eating anything these days really. I've been so completely grossed out. I guess I should add that they did comp the meal.  But ugh.  Just wanted to warn y'all.  Sorry about the pic."}, {"review_id": "v_2m46C3hu5hIVBQdSB_nQ", "user_id": "V_4MldqIEQtuVYFGlh4NkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/26/2017", "text": "Awesome place!

Went there because we saw something on the Internet that said this place was great. Can't believe everything you read, right? Food and service were, at best, indifferent. The real kicker was that after looking at the drink menu and ordering margaritas, the waitress charged us $2 more on the bill than listed on the drink menu. When we asked, she said that after a certain time, the price went up. We pointed out to her that there was nothing on the menu that said that, nor did she tell us when we ordered. She shrugged. By that time, we just wanted to leave, so we paid, left no tip (we figured she'd already gotten one by overcharging for the drinks) and left."}, {"review_id": "wHd3CBeqHF4h7VDycWrXsQ", "user_id": "rGGhXSrty8G3nvRY9lVTFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2017", "text": "Great little hole in the wall authentic Mexican restaurant....the wet shrimp burrito was an incredible bargain at lunch and loaded with flavor.The complimentary bean dip and salsa and chips were also outstanding.

After reading other reviews, we were looking forward to checking out this little hole in the wall. Upon arrival, we were hesitant to go in due to the shady looking people loitering around as well as the dingy appearance of the restaurant. But my husband insisted we try it out. When we went in, we were asked to take a seat wherever we'd like and the waitress brought us menus along with a bowl of chips, salsa and beans. The chips tasted very stale and the beans were super runny. I was ready to leave at this point, but again, my husband insisted we give it a chance. Sooooo, I ordered the two cheese enchilada combo and my husband ordered a pastor burrito.  The enchiladas were so doused in sauce and the cheese was definitely a generic (not quality) brand, it was like enchilada sauce soup. The rice was nearly burnt and the beans were again, very runny. Hubby's burrito was mediocre at best, but better than the enchiladas. The interior of the restaurant was also bothersome. It did not feel clean and there was crap piled up all over the place. I wish I could give a more favorable review, but in my opinion, this was truly an awful experience for us."}, {"review_id": "Z3PO4JVatut866EMlhkGpA", "user_id": "RicEtP_P-1_pG4FMXPBh6Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Me and my wife were reading all these great reviews, so we just had to go, I mean real authentic Mexican food!

I have definitely found places that measure up, but I have found so many more that have done nothing but disappoint. I didn't expect much of anything in Salem, but the reviews were quite promising, so I decided to take the family to check it out.La Fondita is the definition of a \"hole in the wall\", with minimal seating and basic décor. This, however, tends to bode well for Mexican restaurants, so I was quite excited going in. The menu has quite a few options, and after some deliberation the 2 adult entrees ordered were the Camaraones a la Diabla and the Carne Asada. The \"Diablo Shrimp\" came with several large shrimp prepared in a spicy sauce with onions and mushrooms and was served with rice and beans. The Carne Asada consisted of sliced skirt steak accompanied by lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, jalapeno, rice and beans, lime, and sliced avocado. We also got flour tortillas with them, which are made in house! Each entrée was very well done. The shrimp was quite spicy but with a terrific flavor, and the pairing of mushrooms and onions was perfect. The carne asada was prepared perfectly and was quite tender and flavorful. The beans and rice were also exceptional, which was nice considering they tend to be fairly pedestrian at many Mexican restaurants.There wasn't a kids menu, but there were plenty of inexpensive items that sufficed. The quesadilla from the appetizer menu was served on a house made flour tortilla and filled with cheese and your choice of meat. It came with 2 very large quesadilla triangles which worked perfectly for 2 of my girls to split.  My son wanted something heartier and ordered the Tacos Dorados, consisting of 4 rolled tacos fried to crispy perfection and stuffed with either chicken or beef (he chose beef) and topped with lettuce, sour cream, fresh cheese, tomato, and sliced avocado, and served with rice and beans. It was a hefty plate and quite delicious too.La Fondita very much has a homey, family atmosphere, and we felt very welcomed. The service was very good and quite friendly, and the food was super high quality, great portion sized, and utterly delicious. The prices were also quite good and felt like you really got a lot for your spend. My entire family was very happy with the entire experience. I can imagine seating could get hairy for a large group during busier times (e.g. the weekend), but if you are looking for good, home cooked, authentic Mexican food,  you owe it to yourself to head on over to La Fondita."}, {"review_id": "mSLkLSo21-GWL2c_Ecvjug", "user_id": "KYNO6m7WHC-gs7Mk4oBq6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2016", "text": "Wow.
