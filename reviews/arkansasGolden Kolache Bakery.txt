All the kolaches hit you with a variety of familiar breakfast flavors and finish with that buttery dough that brings it all together. The staff is super friendly even for an early morning stop and everything is fresh made in house. My only knock on this place is they need to get a heated display case or something cause the kolaches are always at room temp when I come in and they would be ten times better served hot."}, {"review_id": "1r1tvKayou7Ds_kAVcfU2A", "user_id": "jnM4Ojmp-fFkttrV5M_V4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Wow.  Everything in this place is homemade and perfect.  Owners were there working, very nice people"}, {"review_id": "zkonoJAcadx7107ydxKtlg", "user_id": "EKMlJ1f_Q5Wlwg6Bsg6uPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Doesn't get any better than Golden Kolache!!

I went in and got a variety of kolashes and a cinnamon roll.  We got a sausage and cheese, sausage and gravy, an eggnitter, and cinnamon roll. The sausage and cheese was good but,  the cheese is plain American cheese and that is pretty boring in my book. The sausage and gravy was my least favorite.  The sausage/gravy component was just way too heavy and I did not like the consistency of this at all. The eggnitter was really good. It has egg, bacon and, cheese but again it's boring old American cheese. The cinnamon roll was by far my fav. It was light and fluffy with good texture and flavor of cinnamon and icing.  Service was stellar.  Very friendly people and good ol' southerners. Individually I'd rate-Sausage and cheese-3 starsSausage and gravy -2 starsEggnitter - 4 starsCinnamon roll - 4 stars Service - 5 stars"}, {"review_id": "ifl_lDBihwLzVyHuuth-0Q", "user_id": "vxYw0Ab0l035eJjwHL4ltQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2017", "text": "Let me start with this: the staff is one of the friendliest groups of people I've met at 7AM.
