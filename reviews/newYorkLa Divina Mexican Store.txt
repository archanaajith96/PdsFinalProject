After trying most of the tacos on the menu, I think the carnitas are my favorite and are what I would recommend to everyone going here the first time. Greasy heaven.Wait times definitely seem shorter here compared to the Transit location. We were served less than 2 minutes after completing our order. You also absolutely cannot go wrong with the prices. 6 tacos came to less than $18."}, {"review_id": "yzv24AlUrej9jOLRg7DnVQ", "user_id": "wvM7vXUZnPCvYYzdYlbV1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "La Divina is by far my favorite place for tacos. They have recently expanded their veggie taco section which is amazing for vegetarians. I had my usual, the potato taco and one of their new cauliflower tacos. They also have a mushroom taco that I need to try. They were amazing as usual and I always opt to add cheese. I smothered them with their free toppings bar options of avocado and pico de gallo. Their story is that of success which makes my heart so happy. They used to be a grocery store with a small area for dining. The secret got out that they have one of the most authentic tasting tacos in Buffalo and have now expanded their seating into the grocery store section. There is always a line but moves very fast. Their staff is very hardworking and friendly. This is a great place to come if you are in the mood for a relaxed atmosphere and authentic tacos."}, {"review_id": "MnXCop6vNMJ0lHtP2CNa2w", "user_id": "E3pSbLOF6_TGXYRIRmATow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "La Divina is my husband's favorite spot. There is no question about it. Once when we were there, a group walked into the restaurant and once they figured out that they had to get their own drink from a cooler AND put their own toppings on their tacos, they laughed and walked out. It was for the better. Not to be a jerk, but if you're anything like that group, don't come here because this place is not for you. A lot of people who I know rave about La Divina. It took me many visits to find something on the menu that I really loved. Why did it take me so long? I finally realized that I don't like corn tortillas! Once I made that conclusion, all was right in the world and I was able to find two menu items that were perfect for me. My go to is the Tortas, formerly known as Las Cemitas. This is a Mexican sandwich with avocado, lettuce, onions, jalapeños, mayo, queso and your choice of meat (I go with chicken). It's grilled and just as delicious as it sounds. If they aren't cooking up tortas for the day, I go for the chicken quesadilla which is pretty standard, but it is made with a flour tortilla, which I prefer. I heard that they recently added chips and queso to their menu, which I've yet to try, but I am excited to do so! They play Latin music in the background and the place is decked out with Latin decor as well. All of the workers are very friendly and have smiles that make you feel welcome."}, {"review_id": "rGD3zLvU0jBCYj25kx0CmQ", "user_id": "Z0rwh6vOnKychLoAywg6LA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "$2 Taco Tuesday.

A look from the outside this place looks like a Mexican grocery store- nothing special about it. It actually has mini diner inside and it's cute! The tacos here are cheap and amazing! You get unlimited selection of toppings and the lowest price of taco is only $2 USD. I recommend the pull pork and shrimp, they are delicious as hell.

Adding sour scream and cheese is extra $1 each. They've recently raised their price but it's still pretty good price. My favorite is Asada (steak taco) and I believe it's around $3 per taco. Two tacos fill me up pretty full and guys usually eat 3-4 tacos. It's definitely a good place to check out if you like tacos."}, {"review_id": "4piOdlmrBc_AN0Ax2aSD2Q", "user_id": "HuryfagqpBA1nV-KHQZFcA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "It's more expensive than any place you'd find in California, but comes closest to authentic I've found this side of the Mississippi.

My fiancé talked it up so much and I was super jealous every time he went without me lol.I Ordered 2 brisket tacos, and they were great, just not as salty as I would prefer them to be. I love the fact they use corn shells, but in my opinion the shells were too thick, almost like there was 2 of them per taco, although the sizes of the tacos was pretty decent.Topping selection was pretty good and there were multiple salsa options and other sauces. I Love that I can dress my own tacos, the way I want. That's a huge selling point for me.I'll be moving to the US before the end of the year, and when I crave tacos this will be my first choice."}, {"review_id": "2SiqYPThh9wpN4FmtYabew", "user_id": "VMR6MFg0ImJMQMvrTAV0ug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/14/2017", "text": "La Davina is one of my favorite stops for Mexican food! Let's start off with its unique bodega-like atmosphere. The shop isn't much to look at, but it's a functional quick service style restaurant offering plenty of ethnic food and beverage options. Parking is somewhat a pain in the butt, however on street parking is free and metered close by.  Tacos are cheap...super cheap, compared to other restaurants in the area...they are to die for and generously portioned. They even offer a topping bar (quite possibly my favorite feature...I'm a cilantro addict!) Staff isn't exactly engaging, but many don't speak English too well (except for the cashier)..... But who cares when they make food taste so good! Stop by this bodega the next time you need a taco Tuesday with your friends! There's so many different menu items that everyone will leave happy! They even have large tables for groups."}, {"review_id": "TuDxGE-wgdBUa_T-VAqmCA", "user_id": "0h_lZ8Y3qBF0njSgNcC1LA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Ate here here for the 1st time.

They offer a variety of tacos, quesadillas and accompaniments. It is also a store so you can shop for unique Mexican ingredients while you stop in. Ive tried various tacos and my favories are the pork taco and the veggie taco. You can customize them to your liking with condiments from the combidment bar. I am used to spicy food so I usually put their extra hot sauce on mine, with pico de gallo, cilantro and guacamole sauce. One condiment I noticed here that I havent seen at their other locations is roasted jalapenos. They were delicious on my chicken taco. Their taco shells are homemade corn tortillas that glued together somehow(i assume with cheese) which makes for a sturdy shell to hold in all the ingredients. The decor is vibrant and fun andso are the people who work there. They are always smiling and look like they are having fun behind the counter. I definitely will go back!"}, {"review_id": "i_UZPHTTQOKKsmaJEuQr1w", "user_id": "AIMa7a884TT-PwCC7gtuqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Best tacos in Buffalo. Period.

Everything is fresh and authentic, reminds me of the tacos I had in Mexico. My go-to's are the tacos al pastor (pork with pineapple), pork carnitas and rib-eye steak. They make grill the meat in front of you and then you go to the topping bar to add what you like such as guacamole, a variety of salsas, cilantro and jalapeños.

La Divina has you covered. When you walk in, you're greeted by the music and most important... the smell of tacos. It reminds me of when I traveled down to Florida and Mexico years ago, bringing back authentic and a family-friendly environment. The tacos are made fresh right in front of you and you can choose from a variety of different meat (we went with a group of three people who each ordered two tacos with a different choice of meat per each). You can grab a beer, soda, water, Fanta, etc. pay for your taco (most are under $5) and wait for your taco. A cool feature is the topping bar with a variety of fresh salsas, cut vegetables, and other add-ins.Pro-tip: If you are ordering to-go, hit the topping bar first to grab what you need. It will save you time later as you wait!Amazing presentation, the workers are incredibly nice, and the environment is laid back. Plus they have a convenience store to grab other snacks and food. All at a reasonable price, too!You know where I'll be when I am hungry for tacos.

My husband was very excited to try the cemita sandwich and so we went and ordered. He also is very sensitive to tomatoes and onions so we ordered his without. When we sent the item back for correcting (after standing at the counter for an extended period being ignored), rather than remaking the sandwich the woman opened the box and picked off the items and handed it back. What a joke!! We would have done that but obviously the flavors remained. What a waste. We will return, but if the same woman is working we will not be ordering."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-divina-mexican-store-buffalo?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
