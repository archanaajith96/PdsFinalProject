I'm not the biggest fan of Ruebens, but was down to try. The menu has a million great things to pick from including cheesecake (I'll get to that later), mile high sandwiches, and more! I split a turkey Rueben with the works with my mother the first time. The White Russian sauce with the sauerkraut was pretty damn good and I don't even like sauerkraut. We also ordered a knish. The dough around that potato with the spicy brown mustard was a hit! Last time I had one that good, I was a kid on the streets of NYC with my family. Lastly, we chose a slice of strawberry cheesecake. When the waitress told us 1 slice could be shared between 3-4 people, we didn't believe her. This thing came to the table and she was absolutely correct. The 3 of us and my nephew making 4 shared that 1 slice and it was amazing!!!!!We've been back a few times since then, one time strictly for cheesecake. It's definitely a delicatessen with some fine delicacies. The next time I'm in need for a slice of cheesecake, I'll probably come here."}, {"review_id": "aTY-TBEevz97rykcHnLTmg", "user_id": "u8ybdg4OLkRXgkzR42PkSg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Wowzzers!!! These sandwiches are huge! And the cheesecake... oh my very delicious! I heard the sandwiches were big so hubby and I came prepared to share. Unfortunately, I shared something with him I didn't really want, so I had a piece from everyone of my family members plate. And I must say, they were all good. The star of the show was the pastrami sandwich. It was very juicy and thinly sliced with great flavor. The place definitely reminds you of that NJ - NY cafe vibe and I love it, it really makes me miss it. The staff is very accommodating and will definitely be back soon for the cheesecake!!"}, {"review_id": "zOQ_eMZLbHBBOtg8LN-HYQ", "user_id": "agZRbZsOA7WAk1E0TZKjJA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Visited yesterday at the suggestion of an associate while visiting. My first time and was blown away. I ordered the Sailor because it's my favorite. Loads of pastrami with a knock worst, loads of deli mustard, Swiss cheese on rye  Now I must admit there was so much pastrami I couldn't begin to eat, but there's more to building a sandwich than just stuffing two pounds of meat. The small slices of rye bread were cold, not grilled, the tiny piece of Swiss was also cold and not melted. The sandwich itself was unmanageable, a big negative. I wouldn't hesitate to repeat a visit but this time I will have a few explicit instructions"}, {"review_id": "jrGEbuThfAuf5KI1CDQl8w", "user_id": "pmX_OHLkQ8n3DPC8ZmKErA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Stopped by here for dinner.... never been here before so Dave ordered the hot pastrami and corned beef sandwiches so that I could try both.

The food is ok, but the atmosphere is uncomfortable and hostile. I will never go back and I warn people that if you want a friendly dining experience this is not the place to go. If you want to be surrounded by unhappy restaurant employees that don't seem like they want to be there, then this is place to go. I'm just shocked how the owner talks to people like he is the bee's knees. He looks like the biggest loser that hates his job and life.  I don't care how good food is, I will never give that P.O.S. another cent of my money. It figures why he is the way he is, I have heard from a former employee that he is a Trumper. That right there shows how disgusting of a person he is, supporting the most repulsive, racist, sexist, xenophobic president in history."}, {"review_id": "lw8MaxLEqSYsZcrwbdwunQ", "user_id": "iAbo09fvRTtxl0fKpbRrMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Remember that episode of King of the Hill when Bobby got gout from eating at the Showbiz Deli?

I heard about Route 58 and saw some Yelp photos and always wanted to try it. For some reason, the price of the sandwich scared me away although everyone said it was worth it. And they told me no lies. This is one the best sandwiches I have ever had in like period. I mean absolutely amazing. The pastrami is so fresh and flavorful and as you can see the by the photos there is tons of it. That sandwich can feed two people if you have sides and one person if come with an appetite from out of this world. I have tried the \"disco fries\" which is fries topped with brown gravy and mozzarella cheese and they were so good. I used to eat that alot in NJ so I was happy to know there is a place in the area that makes really good ones. Beware the large portion could easily feed 4 people. I also had the world famous cheesecake which can also feed at least 3 people because its so massive. I don't believe anyone can realistically have room for that after dining so Im sure they get tons of requests to take that home. The service here is very friendly and the food comes out very quickly. I came one time on a Saturday afternoon and the place wasn't that full. I came again during lunch on a weekday and there were no empty tables so they must get a large lunch crowd vs a weekend crowd. Very great sandwich place and I will be a returning customer."}, {"review_id": "55zOwRr-ZvEfhbPFeqdZWg", "user_id": "KRdODHMqAQDtAnVCyThDWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "I wouldn't change a thing about this place as it's as AUTHENTIC as it gets in New York... ugh I mean Virginia  :)They brought a plate to sample their corn-beef (I don't even like corn-beef) but I was hooked!! Tender and flavorful... there was no way I could go wrong, as I ordered a half pound sandwich on rye bread (my only mistake was not asking for it to be toasted as you're gonna want it toasted to help hold up to the mountain of meat they're gonna serve you). Put a little deli-mustard and I felt transported to corner delicatessen in NY. The staff was friendly and fun to chat with and everything from the soups to knishes were delish!! A friend ordered a Salad ((LOL)) don't waste ur time as I'm sure it was tasty, this place is all about MEGA PORTIONS & TONS O FLAVOR... after he wrestled with his salad for 30mins I think he finally got to the greens under all the meat.

Walking in the 58 is a reminds me of a small city cafe. Walking out, I was blown away by my experience. The cakes and cheesecakes could feed a small army and the slice you get could feed 3/4 people but let's be real it is cheesecake and sooo delicious save half for later if you can. Their cheesecake is amazing, it isn't too sweet, dense and not at all that custard like texture that folks pass off as the real deal. This was my first time here and I typically wait until I try a place a couple times before I say it's amazing BUT when there is a line outside with folks HAPPY to wait (not long wait times btw) for their turn at a gut busting super delicious Sammy... I suppose it's at least gotta be OK. I can't say enough about their cheese cake but the sandwiches I have had were so amazing and so incredibly filling (save half for later kind of filling) I am amazed that they are able to keep the place cozy and inviting. There are many options that a northeasterner would love but the HOT CORNED BEEF is amazing with their special deli mustard and their delicious crunchy quick pickles.

Great deal.We split the latkes (half left over). I got chicken salad BLT. Look at the pic... it's ONE POUND of chicken salad, bacon, lettuce, tomato on a perfect challah roll (half left over) and side of mac salad. Husband got egg salad sandwich  (half left over) and fries. You get the point... it's worth it cause you have lunch or dinner the next day.Staff is always helpful. Food comes fast.

Plain white bread, good tomato, and lettuce.The fries were a disappointment, they were krinkle cut with no salt, there was no salt in the bag they gave me either, though plenty of ketchup and napkins.The Reese's Peanut Butter cup cheesecake was good, but not great. It had a pie crust bottom and I definitely missed the normal crumbly cheesecake bottom. To counter the sugar from the Reese's I don't believe there is as much sugar in the cheesecake either.Portions we're massive here, but the price was too.
