Such a blessing in disguise because this place was awesome and I was so happy to try it!Right when we walked in I was surprised because it is so beautifully decorated with fairy lights, and I was expecting your standard hole in the wall. My \"little hole in the wall\" theory lost even more steam when I noticed how many people were here on a random day and time, and that made me really excited to dig in to this food!We started with the spring rolls and crab cheese wontons. I really forgot what we'll prepared crab cheese wontons were supposed to taste like, and thank goodness Pho 888 reminded me. There was actual flavor to them and it tasted like someone made them with care, instead of the microwave version I usually have from my local Chinese spot. Definitely something to order if you come in!!The pho was plentiful and the broth was delicious. I got a large because I knew I'd want to eat it all day, and it was enough that I ate a large portion of it and still left with a full to-go container. I wish there was more veggies in the bowl, but next time I will ask to add some and I'm sure there won't be an issue. My husband got some sort of combo meat plate and it was DELICIOUS! The meat was clearly cooked slowly and with care. A lot of places that specialize in pho can let their other menu items fall by the wayside, but that was not the case here. I'm super grateful for that because he's not a huge pho fan so it's hard for me to drag him to a Vietnamese restaurant, and he's actually excited to go back! The best thing about pho 888 is the impeccable service. Every single person who came to our table was kind, polite, and friendly. We felt like our business was actually appreciated there by the way they treated there. We will absolutely be back because of this. Amazing food with even better service?! It made for an excellent lunch we can't wait to try again. Try one of the smoothies while you're there, they're delicious!"}, {"review_id": "y2Za80m8eV9JLFm8R5LGqg", "user_id": "gnytP16mNF6CFCDnngxGOw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Denver (well, technically Aurora), if you think this is amazing pho, you really should hop on a flight to LA. Pho 888 was reasonable pho, but not a stop that I would go out of my way for when I am back in Colorado.I went with a group of friends and we ordered:- Goi Cuon ~ Spring Rolls- 888 Dac Biet ~ 888 Special Grilled ComboThen I ordered:-  Pho Dac Biet ~ Special Beef ComboThe pho broth was not memorable, and the rest of the meal was just good. In other words, if you happen to be in Aurora and have a craving, please by all means check out Pho 888. If you're in Denver, don't make the drive."}, {"review_id": "44Mx3E9BgTA-I2Tk_x23HQ", "user_id": "adEhXgzdCt5fjJPpFdOj4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Wow!  Wanted some Vietnamese... this place was wonderful.  Took grandkids today.  Still wonderful and so accommodating for the kids with providing bowls to split kid dishes and cups to split their yummy shakes & bobas.  Very fun."}, {"review_id": "c9YpeeSEyyOk61zNaFPMdg", "user_id": "Zfj1fLiPeqAtjQVJRTfpZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "I ubered here by mistake looking for Pho Kitchen 88 which was closer to my hotel. Not sure why the pho houses in this area use the number 8 in their designation.They didn't offer a vegetarian pho here so I ordered the Bun Dau Hu which was very good. The tofu is shredded and flavoured with lemongrass and spices rather than the normal grilled or deep fried cubes. The prices are higher than I would pay in Houston but it's not a surprise given the market is less competitive in the area.My friends also enjoyed their food. The pho ga was clear and featured only white meat. The com thit dac biet featured tons of meat and also shrimp that was stained pink. Like the seasoning or colouring they use for pork. I have never seen shrimp done that way before but my friend said it tasted conventionally fine."}, {"review_id": "F2NvujdZihdADh1tUsrhcA", "user_id": "Qz7XU2bJfdAR_va18B5Ulw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "I absolutely love Pho so I tried it here with brisket, flank, and tendon. I got the large so my friends could share with me and it was huge!! The price for the amount of food you get is pretty good. I probably only ate a third of the large size by myself. The meat was very tender and the broth was perfectly seasoned. My friend got the special combo, which comes with some grilled meats and rice. The seasoning on the meat was very well done and complimented the pho very well. If you come here with friends or family I would suggest you guys share because all the food tastes good together! Side note: I wanted to get some bubble tea here, but it was on the expensive side $5 for a regular sized cup. I didn't end up getting it because I felt that it was overpriced."}, {"review_id": "mB8E5lob8NrPREI2hFG_qg", "user_id": "-PbPi3wYwpLHs6bM7pwFrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "FRESH. FAST. PHO-BULOUS We eat a lot of Pho in LA and was impressed this is  a LEGIT bomb authentic pho spot!Veggies they bring out for the pho was super fresh! Bean sprouts, chopped jalapeños, mint leaves..no cilantro had to ask for it. I got the Pho with rare steak and brisket and was happy that the meat was good quality and they didn't skimp! I usually ask for the steak raw on the side but they brought it out pretty semi-rare in the broth. Yummy!Egg rolls were crispy and delicious and came with all the usual veggies to roll together. Service was fast and friendly.

They serve it with a full plate of sprouts, lime, jalapeños, basil and mint.They are very friendly and helpful when you order.The atmosphere is definitely casual but nice. They are popular (since they are one of the best) and get busy for lunch. The crown is varied which is great it's gone so mainstream and not just in Vietnamese town. I love #3 the Vietnam egg rolls you roll up in lettuce with carrot, cucumber, thin rice noodles and mint. Dip it in the fish sauce and I'm in egg roll heaven!I also had to get the avocado shake and Vietnamese coffee. The coffee is slow drip with sweeten condensed milk, over ice.  I tend to drink it too fast it's like an adult chocolate milk I could sip all day if I didn't get such a sugar and caffeine high."}, {"review_id": "y7Cm8Tx2Leg0bOII_tEacA", "user_id": "uiIg3W3JeRQYqBmqkocc8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Great tasting pho with an eclectic atmosphere! Count me in!We got the spring rolls and they were super tasty. The peanut sauce they gave comes out hot so that was a little different, but still good. The pho flavor was delicious and tasty. Not as sweet as I'd like it but the hoisin sauce was really sweet so I was able to make the broth sweet like I liked it. The price of the pho was very affordable.
