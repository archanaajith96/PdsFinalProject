I believe it was a special that day (pumpkin french toast or something like that) and we also ordered a few things to share, including eggs, breakfast potatoes, gingerbread pancakes and apple cider. Everything was absolutely delicious. It is definitely worth the wait, and if I can stand outside for thirty minutes on one of the coldest day of the year (-18C/-0.4F) then so can you."}, {"review_id": "GUvIO_NWJiGhHm7PmUIZyg", "user_id": "CAyhk0oH4Rxb6mPf2Gdw7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I recently went on a month-long, cross-country road trip from Seattle to Vermont.  It was long, wonderful and full of breakfast stops. And of all the places we went, the Penny Cluse in Burlington was far and away the BEST. I wanted to try everything, but I settled for the gingerbread pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon, a side of well done hash browns and a side of the most intriguing herb cream gravy.  The pancakes were the perfect combination of fluffy, soft, and crispy. Slathered with real Vermont maple syrup and Cabot butter, you're in pancake heaven. The eggs were fluffy and cooked perfectly, as was the bacon. But those crispy potatoes topped with that herb gravy? Oh my God! You could dip anything in that gravy, and I mean ANYTHING, and it would be amazing. It's a smaller place, so in the mornings there's usually a wait. But they will take your name and give you a wait time, so that you can go and walk around Church Street and shop a little while waiting for your table instead of just standing there. Everyone was friendly and upbeat, and I would go back every morning if I lived in Burlington."}, {"review_id": "iSWBi-pvYSiOAuuHinokEg", "user_id": "sOE4MZhpxE5LuqksniEikA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Holy crap get here early. We pulled in right as they were opening and there were already people speed walking to the door and tables were  occupied when we got in!Excellent place. Super cute with fabulously friendly staff. Menu is extensive, with lots of variety. No eggs benedict, which genuinely surprised me. Food was good. I got the huevos verdes and actually found it a little too saucy. The egg was kind of lost in there. And the tortilla was a teensy bit stale. Ugh. Don't you hate writing criticisms about a place that you really liked? But the truth must be told! The black beans were excellent and the sauce itself was delicious. Joe got cornbread french toast, which was delicious. And unlike places around here, where you pay $2 for a little sample sized bottle of real maple syrup, Penny Cluse drops a little jug of dat shizzle right on your table. Overall, this was a delightful experience and highly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "pswBnKTePwEK_sBP5l6k2w", "user_id": "qiPzg1l-b23MTesy6dQorg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Meeehhhh.

Although there is a bit of a wait, it is definitely worth it!The restaurant is so cute, with lots of local art, and the service very friendly.There are many vegetarian options on the semi mexican-themed menu. The food is very flavourful and delicious! We had the breakfast potatoes with sauce/bucket of spuds (in fact, the server discounted my dish, which was the omelet because I chose to forego the potatoes that came with this dish given the size of the bucket of spuds)... Boyfriend had the pumpkin bread french toast- which was absolutely delicious! The mimosas are made with fresh orange juice on top of it.Can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "lTLzAYm5vnrAeUNk9iLcsg", "user_id": "92Mj-5aFGuX65rLp0ujX1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Adorable cafe with great food and homey feel. My boyfriend and I came here around 9 AM on a Wednesday for breakfast. It was packed when we arrived, but we got seated right away. I ordered the yogurt with granola and side of sourdough toast. Both were delicious. My bowl was majority granola (which was still warm, yum). My boyfriend ordered the Bellber combo which comes with two pancakes or french toast, two eggs any style, and a side of home fries, bacon, ham, or sausage. He opted for the gingerbread pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon as his side. I immediately regretted not ordering the gingerbread pancakes after tasting his; they were amazing! The serving sizes were huge, especially for what you pay."}, {"review_id": "l-6AB4t1TH2lH5Ed3FBBpg", "user_id": "42xivNZY7gTSpxXhkMicXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Came here for the first time but my parents had been here several times before so they knew I needed to experience this wonderful brunch spot! The place is located on a street corner in downtown Burlington. Parking can be difficult when it's very busy there because of the located. It's across the street from a grocery store. The wait on weekends can be hours long because it's so amazing that people come from near and far. We came in a weekday and only needed to wait about ten minutes. The place is a cute hole in the wall that just feels like you're in your mother's kitchen being taken care of with all the love of your mothers kitchen too! We decided to order a lot today... it all looked so good! For drinks, my mom had one of the beers they had- Hill Farmstead Edgar. I ordered the special bourbon eggnog- the eggnog was amazing. It was served with Ice cubes and you couldn't taste the bourbon but it was so smooth and delicious. For an appetizer we decided to share one of the specials - the applebread French toast- we only got one to share as we knew the portion sizes were large. This was very good! Served with sour cream, apple sauce and of course- Vermont maple syrup. For our main meals, my dad ordered the egg and cheese sandwich on sourdough- very easy meal but looked really delicious. And it was - he finished it all. My mom ordered one gingerbread pancake and then two eggs with two toasted corn muffins. I found the gingerbread pancake quite dry and a bit flavorless honestly. The eggs were good and the corn muffins were always really good. Didn't have chunks of corn which is just the way I like it! For myself, I got the basic breakfast which came with home fries, biscuits and eggs. All was great. I honestly cannot wait to try more things on the menu! There were so many options and it was so hard to choose because everything looked and tasted so good!"}, {"review_id": "5FreqtkfwsIEsVBG9XlgOA", "user_id": "eqS5lpxVMEzS_xaGP8NW_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "We ate our way through Burlington the last few days.

If you don't want to wait for a table, you should probably arrive on the earlier side. We weren't terribly motivated this morning...so we got there at around 10 AM.Everything was delicious!

It was perfect and so huge! The portions were so generous, I took half of the potatoes home, along with two slices of ham and two of toast (that I slathered with that yummy fresh strawberry preserves on the table-made myself some mini monte-cristos). I also got the fresh OJ-definitely a good choice. My friend got the Huevos Verdes, 2 eggs any style served on flour tortillas with jack cheese, tomatillo-avocado salsa and black beans. She loved it.
