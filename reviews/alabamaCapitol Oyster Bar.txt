Definitely an off-the-beaten-path, locals-only, hole-in-the-wall kinda joint, which made it that much cooler. Bit of a wait when we got there (Saturday night), which we were able to bypass since we were willing to sit at the bar outside. Turns out \"the bar\" was this semi-circlular table placed around the trunk of a huge oak tree that they'd built the deck around - we thought it was the best seat in the house and couldn't believe our luck! The covered deck overlooks the Alabama River, and most of the surrounding property is undeveloped woodlands - makes for a really unique ambiance, especially considering you're only three minutes off I-65! No joke, you feel like you've stumbled onto the set of a movie -- think Lynyrd Skynyrd documentary and this is some local watering hole where they just happen to drop in for some suds and an impromptu performance. This is THE place Garth is singin' about in \"Friends in Low Places\". There is, in fact, a raised stage outside, and some other patrons told us they have bands regularly, but we were there early (5:30ish) aaaand there seemed to be a pretty hellacious storm brewing, so no live music for us.So, how's the food, you're busy probably asking. Definitely a thumbs up from us - we had the scallops and whole catfish, both fried, and they were great. If you're expecting gourmet, this ain't it (nothing pan-seared, almond-encrusted, or redux-covered on this menu), but if you're okay with fried or steamed seafood without any pageantry, this is your place. Our only disappointment came when we asked our waiter (who, like the hostess, was super friendly) how much the raw oysters were: $18.95! That's pretty dang pricey for a dozen oysters in my book, so we skipped those, but the couple next to us reported that they're always good.Decent beer selection. Didn't ask about wine because it just doesn't seem like a wine kinda place, but that's just a guess. There was a full bar inside but - again - I wouldn't look for anything too highfalutin in the cocktail department. There's an area outside for playing cornhole (and having a beer or two) while you wait for your table or food, or you can walk down to the water to look around and check out the boats. Bathroom was pretty shabby but seemed clean enough, and there was a friendly (and very fat) cat named Smokey that made her rounds to all the tables outside. What more could you ask for?! All in all, I'd give 'em a 9.9 out of 10, and it'd be an easy 10 if those friggin' oysters weren't so expensive!"}, {"review_id": "AbQyjx1YewSO7i6Srxk7pQ", "user_id": "WF_vgdqccG2ZbBhQ4GBOMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "We LOVE the Capitol Oyster Bar. Try and go on Sunday when they have live blues starting at 5pm (I believe that's the time). They have some incredible acts come through. Food is amazing as well. Oysters of course are a must. Fried gator and Argentine shrimp are deliciously as well. Beer, wine, and a full bar are available too. Sitting outside over looking the Alabama River -- with live blues -- is really special."}, {"review_id": "o2vb-J9myha8EAlOEr4XDw", "user_id": "i59lKE9e3BgCr5HUBFLHug", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "This place had good ratings but our experience was less than stellar. It was a spur of the moment decision when we realized we were short on time and would not be able to make our original destination. Our group of five motorcycles (4 couples and a single) were out riding on a Saturday. Pulling up to the restaurant, the drive back into the restaurant was littered with old boats. It gives you the authentic hole in the wall kind of feel! We had a half hour wait outside before being seated. It's relatively small seating area - with the fire marshal's safe occupancy limited to 70+ occupants. Each table had Crackers and hot sauce. We were quickly greeted by our server - and orders taken... An hour after we ordered, our appetizers came. The Oysters Rockefeller were really good. My salad was not fresh. The lettuce was wilted and I picked out the worst and ate the rest, but it was not enjoyable. Another half hour later, we decided to leave without having our entrees delivered to the table. Our sweet waitress apologized stating the kitchen had been slammed and our tickets were up next for the chef to cook. However, we couldn't wait any longer as some of our party had to be back home at a specific time - and mind you, we had already been there two hours. Summary: waitress good. Kitchen slow. Food mediocre to good. We probably would not go back."}, {"review_id": "3P9qgTrPp0OmDyCLqxRpLg", "user_id": "9hvm17O89JE3Gv63glW7TQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "A fantastic seafood restaurant with a low-key atmosphere and live music on weekends. The venue has both indoor and outdoor seating, though expect a wait when there's live music. My girlfriend and I split the fried crab claws for an appetizer. They were good but not worth the $20 price tag (my fault for not asking what \"market price\" was). For entrees, I got the grilled amberjack, which was perfect, and my girlfriend got the fried catfish, which was great. The French fries and hush puppies are solid sides."}, {"review_id": "ofIOdaS8u3EyvSpip67mrw", "user_id": "fq5WiOzDucEFC4NZz_UamQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "This place is awesome.

It's nothing special, so don't let the appearance outside (or inside) turn you off. The service was absolutely phenomenal! Their seafood gumbo is a great balance of seafood (shrimp and crawfish) with sausage, tomatoes, and okra. Don't jump to adding hot sauce like I did-- it has a lot of kick you don't realize is there until after you've had a bite and let it settle! ha!I was a little disappointed that they didn't offer blackened seafood, only \"grilled with extra seasoning.\" I got the grilled Trigger Fish, crawfish mac n cheese, and cole slaw. The cole slaw is vinegar based and it was the right balance between sweet and tangy. The mac n cheese looked great, but in all honesty it was a bit bland. The crawfish was tough (overcooked) and there was more flavor of the bell peppers in it than anything. The rest of my party really enjoyed it, though. I was just looking for more of a creamy/cheesy taste with seafood. The fish was cooked really well, but it needed a lot more seasoning. The tartar sauce that it came with was good to go on it, but I definitely was wishing they had added more seasoning. Decent food overall, excellent service. I'll go back, I just won't get the same items that I did the first time."}, {"review_id": "IJIv6mX-3ORpu36D48TVww", "user_id": "-hYYjAXSAa657rY0ANtTGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "The tag line for this place should be \"looks like hell, tastes like heaven.\" Located in the middle of nowhere, you would guess you are driving up on either a junk yard or a crime scene by the looks of the place. The only advertisement signaling that you are close is written on the side of a broken down boat just before you hit the parking lot. However, don't let the Texas Chainsaw Massacre appearance of the outside deter you. The inside is decent and has a ton of good food waiting. We sat on the back patio and were greeted by one of the best waitresses we've ever encountered. The place had a relaxed feel and it felt like a good place to spend a lazy afternoon. The menu offered a lot of different seafood options cooked several different ways. We started with fresh gulf oysters and moved on to shrimp hammers, which were fried shrimp with jalape√±o cheese. I'm normally not someone who mixes cheese with seafood, but these were fantastic. After that, we indulged in some gator tail which was soft and not chewy at all- a clear sign that the cooks know exactly what they were doing and likely soaked the gator tail in milk before cooking. We finished off with an order of steamed crab claws and agreed that the meal was worth every penny. If you are in the Montgomery area and looking for good seafood, this is your place!"}, {"review_id": "r_mss7tSQ0-czlyWED2rsw", "user_id": "M-_wDQAYL7K5W-wozBmUzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "OMG WHAT A GEM!! Eat here now :) We love a place where the owner comes out and tells us that the fish we ordered is not up to her standards to serve, and can she substitute a more expensive better quality fish? We had the fried gator appetizer, and it is w best gator we have ever had. Tender, mild, breaded in seasoned corn meal and perfectly fried, it was AWESOME.Frog legs platter ditto - they had been marinated and dredged simply in corn meal before being fried to crispy doneness. These are frog legs to beat all frog legs and we recommend them HIGHLY.Fresh oysters are shucked before your eyes and the great selection of local microbrews pairs perfectly. 5 succulent stars!!"}, {"review_id": "SBFBLuuPL3INefoYKyl-tA", "user_id": "4Szz1CKZXAvDR7ZUhnnJvg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "First, I have to say the atmosphere was wonderful. It's a great place to go to have a few drinks and dance while listening to a live band. I suggest eating before you go. We had never been here before but were optimistic. It took about 20 minutes to get something to drink. At that time we ordered some oysters to start off. We sat there for a good hour before our server decided to take our order for a main course, then an additional hour to get our food. It was almost like they forgot we were even there. I went with my husband and 2 boys. They received their food way before I got mine. The food was absolutely awful. No flavor to it at all. I would say captain D's is 10x better then this place, which is ridiculous given the price. It cost almost $100 to feed us but the server never checked on us. I give 2 stars only because I believe it would be a great place to see a band but that's it."}, {"review_id": "I5zFWBOTyBKW3dZY5dU55Q", "user_id": "7kPRhDtYchX5O7w-sEyI0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "I really enjoyed this place.

We had to grab drinks and wait on the porch for a table but the view of the Alabama river was beautiful and it was a good day to chill outside. We didn't have to wait too terribly long for a table. Oysters Rockefeller for appetizer were delish and we also tried the gator tail, which were some fried balls of goodness. I had the whole fried catfish which I haven't had in years and it was no disappointment. Husband had the scallop po-boy and he really enjoyed it.

So imagine my surprise when I walked in and saw this really neat, backwoods ambiance, restaurant by the river.The loss of 2 stars is for the service and price. Some of the items are over priced, side items, like fries and hushpuppies are pretty reasonable. On a side note, my husband goes here every time he is in town for the fresh oysters.The service was lacking. While the waitress was friendly, she took a long time bringing our drinks, getting our food order, refilling our drinks, etc. Basically, everything took a long time.FYI if you eat outside, get ready to be assaulted by flies when your food comes. Yes, I know, we were outside. BUT there were very few flies before the food came out, then they swarmed!The husband will go back for the oysters, I will probably stay at the hotel next time.
