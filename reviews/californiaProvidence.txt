My husband and I came back because we want to celebrate our wedding anniversary there.Like last time, we received a card from Providence. The menus changed a lot. They used to have uni egg, their signature dish, in the pre fixed menus, but they make it as an add on for $28. They also have my other favorite, pan seared foie gras, on the a la carte menu. We added those two courses to the Providence tasting menu (4 courses). With two more complimentary courses, there were total of 8 courses per person. We were impressed by the complimentary salad, which was too beautiful to eat. The salad was refreshing and it was a good start of our dinner. The other complimentary course was the crab soup, which was as good as the lobster soup from their tasting menu years ago.All courses were amazing, and service was perfectly good. Providence is still our favorite restaurant in LA."}, {"review_id": "XRm1mqdAXQQFDgRIM2K0Ng", "user_id": "TZmS0DxF8ihiVM05QiPXEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "OVERALL:This was my first time at a 2 michelin star restaurant. Amazing experience from beginning to end. I was shocked in the best way possible - kind of like when you go on a blind date expecting to get murdered but end up finding your soul mate. Definitely pricy, but you gotta cough up them dollars for a 5 star meal people. They take a lot of time to ensure that each bite you take is like a punch to the face, but in a good way. You won't ever have a bite where you aren't experience multiple different sensations in your mouth. PARKING:For people concerned about parking, because it IS Los Angeles, & we all know how that can be (300 signs on one street, spends 1 hour reading all the signs, looks back and car is towed) - they got valet, I mean obviously.FOOD:I don't even know where to begin with this. I went with the Providence Tasting Menu...because 1. I couldn't go with their lowest tier, considering I am probably only going to be coming here once a year, or maybe once every two years...but if I become a millionaire one day (we can only hope) I will come here once a month. 2. I couldn't go with the higher tiers because I knew I wouldn't be able to finish all the food that I would've paid a leg and an arm for and have to stuff it all into my pockets like a barbarian at a fine dining restaurant.Their menu changes...I'm pretty sure...so please don't quote me on exactly what I got. I have pictures so for those particular people, you can check those out and let me know if I'm wrong.5 course tasting menu, but comes out to about 11 dishes.1. AMUSE BOUCHE - Yes I'm boujee. A pickled radish dumpling sack thing with crab stuff inside. Horrible description, but trust me, delicious.2. AMUSE BOUCHE - Shrimp cracker with a lime jelly thing on a leaf with an edible flower petal.3. AMUSE BOUCHE - A ravioli looking thing topped with dill.4. AMUSE BOUCHE - Wagyu beef cigar. The presentation of this was just immaculate. 5. LAST of the AMUSE BOUCHE - Steamed mussel served on rocks, with a shot of cream of mussel soup. \"Sir, can I uh...just take a bucket of that and bathe in it please.\"6. FIRST COURSE (can you believe it?...I'm already full) - Geoduck RAW (one of my personal favorite foods) topped with horseradish snow. The geoduck was the freshest I've ever had. 7. SECOND COURSE  - Abalone COOKED, mixed with fried sunchokes or something of that sort? It had seeds and stuff in it too & all the flavors were so intricate.8. THIRD COURSE - Scallops with a foam dressing & topped with scallions. I mean each bite was like I was being born again from the womb, experiencing the world for the first time.9. FOURTH COURSE - Black code served on top of a light cream sauce with some cilantro lemon oil dots, potatoes, cooked clams, & string nettle. The skin was cuhhhrispy, just how I like it.10. FIFTH COURSE - THIS THIS IS IT. I have never had REAL A5 Wagyu beef before. This was my first time. And OHHH LORD, I was not ready. They cooked it to perfection (medium rare), and lightly seasoned with salt because that's how real carnivores eat meat. You leave it be and let the meat shine through.It's so juicy - melts in your mouth goodness, like a meat cloud. Heavy though, so I totally get the amount they give you. Let's just say that at this point, I was bulging out of my seat. But we're not done.11. CLEANSER - A raspberry sorbet on top of what tasted like turmeric ice of sorts? This is to cleanse your pallet for dessert.12. LAST COURSE (or is it?) - Smores cocoa nib ice cream. Oh lord. I personally don't like dessert or sweets in general (SHAAAAME), but this was so dang good. 13. MORE?!?! - Yes, more. Chocolates, macaroons, & jelly candies. Those chocolate. Holy crap. If I could have 300 of those I would. I don't know what was in it, but I will go there again just for those little chocolates. **I ended up having to get the those little baby desserts to go and Cameron, the angel that he is, gave me some muffins in the bag too.**So there you go. I did my best. The food is incomparable. There is a reason why they've been around for so many years and have 2 michelin stars. GRADE: A++++++++++++SERVICE & AMBIANCE:The servers are not servers, they're gods. Not only, do they give you a detailed overview of your meal, they will cover your food if you get up from the table to ensure optimal temperature (WHAT?). We had this guy Cameron, and HE IS THE BEST. The restaurant is very formal and boujee, but Cameron brought some light heartedness & comedy to the table. I truly enjoyed that. Made me feel like a normal person & not a person who was eating a $300 meal. The people who say this place is outdated, I actually really liked it. Classy.GRADE: A+++++++++++CONCLUSION:Just go. I ran out of room to write."}, {"review_id": "qY7yNGov3L87EXGgSKBvfw", "user_id": "_fXr8roymf7BDckaoFZB-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Last night's dinner at LA's Providence.  I got the Providence Tasting Menu and I will be highlighting some of the dishes: king crab appetizer, their bread, salt roasted Santa Barbara Spot Prawn, yellowtail with snap peas, black cod with potato and clams, and A5 Wagyu. Food:The king crab appetizer consists of a small, thin circular wafer and bouillabaisse both containing the essence of the king crab in their respective ways. On top of the circular wafer there is minced crab meat with the crab's gut/roe acting as a form of butter. The flavor is wholesome, balanced and delicate. The texture is buttery and lightly rich. It is something you want to chew several more times before swallowing. The bouillabaisse has a slight tang from the tomato base, with hints of saffron and the savoriness that's imparted from the crab. Their bread comes in seaweed, mixed grain and brioche. I opted for the brioche without any regret. I have not had good brioche until last night quite frankly. The texture of the brioche is pillowy soft with inherent buttery aftertaste. Me, being the glutton that I am, breaks apart the brioche and butter each individual piece while adding slight bits of salt in the midst [each bite is delightful]. The salt roasted Santa Barbara Spot Prawn is great. The shrimp's flesh is inherently sweet and it's chewy and bouncy in texture [signifying the shrimp's freshness and quality]. Eat it by dipping it in the shrimp's brain and it's great. The yellowtail with snap peas is wonderful. The yellowtail sashimi is very fresh. The snap peas are tender and tasty; the olive oil at the bottom adds a layer of smoothness to the flavor profile. Overall this dish is light and delicate in nature. The black cod with diced potatoes and baby clams is delicious. The fish melts in the mouth and leaves a thin layer of fat upon one's lips after eating. The diced potatoes are tender and flavorful from the dashi broth sauce at the bottom [very tasty]. The baby clams are thoroughly cleaned, fresh and tender: each a delectable morsel. For the A5 Wagyu, there's two parts to it: the Wagyu cigar and strip steak. Think of the wagyu cigar as a small egg roll: thin outer shell that carries a light crunch with minced wagyu as the filling. The cigar is smoky in flavor; the minced Wagyu fills the palate with beefy meat juice and has a melt in the mouth evanescent texture. The strip steak is delightful. The marbling buttery fat oozes and fills the palate as one chews the Wagyu; in the midst is the satisfying savory beef aftertaste in each bite. Ambiance:Dimly-lit, intimate, romantic and upscale. Service:The service is expected of a two star Michelin: staffs are all professionally dressed, they pull out the patrons' chair, put the dining cloth across the customers' lap, engages in conversation with the clients and patiently explains the menu as well as each dish for the evening. Price:Reasonable in comparison to other two star Michelin: $250 after tax and 20% tip. Two star Michelin usually costs around $200+ to $325 depending on where you go. The price does not include alcoholic beverages. If drinks were included, the price can be much higher. Overall:Great place to celebrate special occasions if you're looking for an evening of good service and sampling dishes that are made from the freshest ingredients."}, {"review_id": "PZXsYMYiW0Iz0nLsXFq_VA", "user_id": "u79JLmKzua7wxGxs1Q3Qkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "One of the best restaurants in Los Angeles, curating an experience well worth the luxurious price tag. Reservations are required, and easily acquired online via Opentable or by phone. If you have any dietary restrictions, you must let them know in advance. I made a reservation about 1 month in advance for my boyfriend's birthday, and a friendly employee called me to confirm the details. For birthdays and other special occasions, they provide a customized card and a candle in the guest of honor's dessert.Holding two highly coveted Michelin Stars, Providence is well known for their seafood, but caters to vegetarians as well. Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and seated in enormous plush chairs at a spacious table. The ambiance is and simple and sophisticated, with a polished oceanic color scheme and romantic lighting. The single person restrooms are larger than my old studio apartment. We ordered cocktails while perusing the tasting menu options, both of which were fantastic. I got the seasonal \"Springlet\", an herbal gin cocktail, and my boyfriend got the Muy Thai, a sweet and aromatic mix of rum, lemongrass, kaffir lime, and serrano chili.Unfortunately, the most extravagant Chef's tasting menu cannot be paired with a vegetarian counterpart. So, my boyfriend had to choose between the Providence tasting menu, and the Signature/Seasonal tasting menu, which I recommend. We decided to each do the wine pairing, which was an unforgettable journey including an exquisite French Chardonnay, a unique fringe Spanish Hondarrabi Zarratia, and a rich, velvety Cinsaut/Grenache with the main. My favorite of the evening was the Pinot Gris, from Domaine Zind humbrecht in the Alsatian region. Proceed with caution if you are a lightweight-the pairing includes a LOT of wine. I was trashed by the end of the meal, and significantly hungover the next day. Every course of my vegetarian Seasonal tasting menu was extraordinary. Chef Michael Cimarusti is famous for his mastery in sustainable seafood (which my boyfriend appreciated), but executes some of the best vegetarian dishes I have ever enjoyed as well. The first course, an artful display of crudités with a rich miso dipping sauce, was the perfect introduction. The next was a richly spiced tomato soup, followed by a tartlet filled with a roasted tomato filling. My vegetarian counterpart to the Yellowtail was a lovely snap pea salad in light citrusy dressing. The black truffles atop grilled lettuce component of my main was easily one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. Course after course of consistently excellent plant based masterpieces were presented to us over a well paced 3 hour meal.There was not one, but three dessert courses. The clear winner was the Buddha's Hand fruit, which is served with a prosecco sorbet. Sweet and tangy, perfectly complimented by the crisp fruity wine. The tasting menu was concluded with French caramel macarons, chocolate truffles, and fine Italian espresso. We were presented with our check, and a bag of chocolate chip muffins to take home for breakfast the next day. $673 for dinner for two (plus $140 tip). Providence is expensive, but you already knew that. Worth every dollar, in my opinion. I highly recommend dining here, and look forward to returning."}, {"review_id": "Uu2_hgvSyQfiANWnCXUW4A", "user_id": "Wh6Kbxq1WwHfgmsuVyWoGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Spontaneously decided to have dinner here for a friend's birthday last night and I was impressed.I'd like to start with the service, it was impeccable. I've been to fancy restaurants that have an air of pretentiousness to it but not this one. The servers were friendly and the main gentleman who walked us through our meal was so fun! I wish I remember his name. He started us off and explained everything to us. I like that he accommodated certain food restrictions. They would escort you to the restroom when you needed it. And as a busy place, lots of servers are around so they tell each other guest to make way for you. Now the food, we ordered the Providence Prix fix menu. They started us off with 4 different amuse Bouche (tiny appetizers) that aren't included in the description of the menu. Oyster with Fennel: it was light and refreshing. Taken in one slurp I tasted the oyster first and then there was a savory smoke kick at the end. Amazing Kelp crackers: light and crispyPuffy rice crackers filled with salmon topped with pickle: crispy and then soft on the inside - delish Mussel with garlic and a foamy soup broth: the mussel was creamy and the flavor was perfect. The broth to complement was deliciousEach and every appetizer so far I savored and wanted more of.Next the Wagyu Cigar - something so completely out of this world delicious that I took my time to eat it. I wanted each bite to last forever. Wagyu beef wrapped in a crispy layer of what I think was a pastry wrapper ? Its served in a cigar box and made to look like a tiny cigar.  You bite into it and the meat melts in your mouth but you could still feel the crispy texture of the wrapper. To  dip I had a sour plum sauce which complemented it well. I relished in every bite. I certainly wanted more. Crab with yogurt made in liquid nitrogen and blood orange: Now this dish is pure gastronomy. They pour the blood orange sauce in front of you on the side of your dish to beautifully surround it in a bright red. This dish had it all, bright vibrant colors with the fresh blood orange and the lavender. Each bite was fresh, crispy and creamy. Truly an experience for your mouth. The crab and the blood orange went so well together. It was also a decently sized portion. Starting off with the amuse Bouche I thought I'd walk out starving.Next the brought us a choice of breads, seaweed bread, brioche and a regular bun. The seaweed bread topped with the melt in your mouth butter and rock salt was so good. The brioche was sweet and fluffy. Then they brought us a white fish with fennel and clams. The fish was so wonderfully soft and delectable that it fell apart as soon as your fork hit it. Next was my favorite, the Wagyu. I cherished each bite as if it were my only one. The meat so soft it melted in your mouth. As soon as I was done I wanted another one, but for a supplemental $50 I knew that would be it for me. To finish,  our dessert was s'mores and cocoa nib ice cream. It was beautifully presented with a layer of the softest creamiest brownie I've ever had. Then a thin layer of chocolate and then a small tart at the bottom to bring it all together. I thought we were done, but then they brought out small chocolate bon bons to finish. The guava pate de fruit was so refreshing it was like biting into an actual guava minus the seeds. The Macaron Sesame was delicious. The chocolate bon bon earl grey tasted like you were drinking the actual tea. I would come back here in a heart beat if it wasn't so expensive. I just have to wait for the next big event I guess to have a reason to come here."}, {"review_id": "Fa66RCc1Kq8k16jwdB3qXg", "user_id": "FRoSuqfC5AY0ZWlw1AryIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "This is a place you take someone you dated for a while and are ABSOLUTELY sure you love them.

The presentation is on point, and the taste is so memorable. It was definitely worth spending the $600.My favorite was their uni egg, which we had to order a la carte. DO NOT SHARE THIS. Order one per person. It's pricey for a dinky little thing, but it's SO worth it because no other restaurant (that I know of) makes it like that. The closest is Miyabi's uni shooter with quail egg, but Providence takes their uni egg ON A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL."}, {"review_id": "aMoquuiNh4wx3wEm17cgLg", "user_id": "Uit6vvFxthHbwOHIYI0sfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "I have to admit it was one of the best food tasting I've had.Last time I was here, almost everything was a la carte with perhaps a couple pre fixed menu options.

Dine la! Woot!The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 starts is b/c I have to admit there were some dishes and sides of the dishes that I didnt love.First off parking...is valet. About $8 I think.I chose the smallest tasting and added an a la carte item (the uni egg) + the wine pairing.Although I really enjoyed the amuse bouches that came with the tasting. Especially the pillow one with the smoked fish on top and the wagyu cigar (if that's even considered a amuse bouche). :)The winning dish was the upgraded A5 wagyu steak and the wine pairing I decided to do.The thing with wagyu is that you can't really have too much of this.It can get a little nauseating (for me) without some sort of pickles or something to refresh your palate. So the portion size was perfect.Price? Not so much.NANCY'S DAY BOAT SEA SCALLOPshiitake, turnip-Beautifully plated dish.

I didn't like the sides too much but the steak was cooked perfectly med rate.SATSUMA-IMO, YUZU, CRÈME FRAÎCHE-I didn't care for this at all. I like fruity desserts to end with. This was more like peanut butter/caramel flavor. Wish there was a different option.However I did have the wine pairing and the Reisling that was paired with it was really delicious and made the dish taste better.$100 / $150 with wine pairing during Dinela 2018You get a nice little pastry to take home.

I felt skinny.The decor is simple and there's bubbles like you're in the water or something.The people seemed more on the mature side.

He said that if he had to choose one place to eat in the LA area, this was it. I figured the five-year anniversary with the wife was as good of an occasion as any other to knock this one off the bucket list. The menu consists only of three different tasting menus. If you're a first timer, I would highly recommend the Chef's tasting menu (go big or go home, plus you get to try everything). If you do, strap yourself in, because it is an eighteen course, three and half hour extravaganza. You start off with six amuse-bouche courses, followed by seven main dishes, followed by a cheese dish, concluding with four dessert dishes. A few highlights from the menu:Spiny lobster - Neither the wife nor myself are big fans of lobster and its texture. That's what makes this dish the surprise hit for the entire night. The meat was sweet and succulent. If I was blindfolded, I would have guessed I was having a scallop dish based on the tenderness. Wagyu - This feels like a cop out. I have never been to a top tier restaurant and felt disappointed by a wagyu dish. The meat is buttery and rich. Usually I am not a fan of having sauce and garnishes with my steaks, but it definitely added a hidden layer of taste without masking any flavor of the meat itself. Cheese dish - We selected the Roldolphe Le Meunier black truffle brie over the traditional cheese cart. The rind was soft and the paste was creamy and buttery. This was simply the best cheese I've ever had. The Cigar - Perfectly crisp on the outside with wagyu on the inside and it comes inside a real cigar box! The presentation of this amuse-bouche was simply impeccable. All in all, this was the best meal we've ever had and better than any three Michelin star restaurants we've been to. In future visits, I will likely pick a smaller tasting menu as eighteen dishes leaves you feeling slightly uncomfortable at the end. TLDR:Taste 5/5Presentation 5/5Service 5/5Wine 3.5/5 (9 pours in the wine pairing. Nothing was too special and the port at the end reminded me of sophisticated cough syrup)"}, {"review_id": "T7_LY8AVAiAQHnSMT7TqTg", "user_id": "RndtjBHm41mIisU-oGeV1A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "We were able to make reservations for Providence on OpenTable which made it easy to add on to one of our trips down to LA.

For 2 michelin stars, we didn't really notice a difference between this meal and a lot of the 1 michelin star experiences.

They serve three amuse bouche before the starter. I really enjoy the amuse-bouche very pleasant. They serve two starters: Nancy day boat sea scallop and Vermilion rockfish. It was good but not memorable. The rcokfish is good if they didn't burn the fish skin. The taste of burnt skin is too strong, I couldn't taste the fish. Eggplant pure is good, it doesn't taste eggplant. They serve free bread before the main dish. I love free bread!! =PFor main dish I got Liberty farm duck. Theres part of the duck I got very chewy that I can't swallow it and I  have to spit out, don't want to choke myself.Tried Rodolphe le meunier black truffle brie additional $20. Truffle cheese is decent except for the bread its burnt, AGAIN! Smh! Dessert: Satsuma-imo, yuzu, creme fraiche its really good. Not too sweet, love the chewy and crunchy.

The server tried to clean our table by scraping all the crumbs. Instead of catching all the crumbs she(server) drop all on my chair. SERIOUSLY?!!! I wanted to call the manager so bad but I feel bad for the server. Also, when they refilled my water they filled up my cup full. When I tried to get my water to drink the water is spilling because it was that full.  Very disappointed specially they know I'm celebrating my birthday and this is my first time here.

So of course I came with the highest of expectations. Boy was that a mistake.Probably considered one of the fanciest restaurants in LA, I was not impressed. The interior seemed dated and dreary. It was dimmed and some might even call it romantic, but brown and blue color schemes does not inspire any romance nor charm. At least the chairs extremely comfortable. On to the more important matter. Most of the dishes served were very aesthetically appealing and creative. I enjoyed almost all the food that were served. Came here to enjoy their dinela menu for $100. Which is pretty much their \"smaller\" tasting menu. You get two starters, one entree, one dessert, three amuse-bouche, and some thank you sweets. Oh I almost forgot the free bread. The French bread was probably the tastiest thing I had. Free always taste better right?All of the amuse bouche were awesome. I thoroughly enjoyed them. No complaints. The first starter was the scallops with radish. The radish didn't go well with the scallops. Others then the radishes, it was delicious. I wish I knew what the chef was going for with the radish. I was thinking cutting the richness? Didn't work for me.Second dish was the rock fish with egg plant purée. I loved the fish. It was very meaty but tender. It's like cod or some other white flesh sea fish. The fish tasted very clean, and was complimented by the savory sauce. However I disliked the purple purée on the side. It tasted like stale Asian chips. It was really bad. Good thing it was on the side so I didn't have to use it. Again, I want to know what the chef was going for with the egg plate purée.Main course was the entree. You have the choice of swordfish or duck breast. Or if you are feeling rich $40 more gets you the A5 wagyu Kobe beef. Since I came for dinela, I'm not trying to spend more than I have to.The swordfish was very good. The fish was a little fishy but it wasn't bad enough to bother me. The duck was very good on its own. But the gizzard that was dressed on top was not so good. It had a very irony and organ-y after taste. I'm not a fan of that. Others then that, the duck was tender, well seasoned, and very tasty. Too bad the gizzards ruined it for me.Dessert was the best. It was crunchy, chewy, melty, cream, and simulated all sorts of mouth feels. Very inspiring. Overall the food was pretty good with some kinks. I may not have appreciated it as much but perhaps others might.Service was not good for a restaurant of this caliber. There was one particular incident that offended me, it's so bad that it is unacceptable for any restaurant. So there were some crumbs on the table. The server came by to clean it up. Instead of scrapping it off the table on to the floor and away from us, all the crumbs landed on my girlfriend's chair. I don't think she(the server)even knew what she had done. Good thing it was on the part of her(my gf) chair that she wasn't sitting on or else tables would be flipping. It was only one of a few things that bothered me. I hope the staff sees my review and get their act together. You guys are suppose to be one of LA's best.

He was actually going to take me to Osteria Mozza, but I spoiled it by taking him there for his birthday... oops? Either way, I finally got to get both restaurants off my LA foodie bucket list last year (2017). Yes, this review is a couple weeks late, but that winter holiday hangover is real.They have tasting menus at various price options, which I greatly appreciate because it allows people on a more modest foodie budget to get their feet in the door. I have to note, however, that hey require everyone at the table to order the same tasting menu, so you and your friends better agree on a budget before coming here! The lowest and middle price tier menus come with less items, but Providence also offers a la carte items that can be added to those tasting menus. I want to go back and try their famous uni egg, which has been on their menu since they opened years ago.Being the birthday girl, my hubby let me choose the tasting menu. So of course, I went with the Chef's Tasting menu. I preferred that it was much more seafood forward. It does come with 11 course (including the dessert courses), plus the plethora of amuse bouches they offer to whet your palate. That's a total of 18 different foods you get to eat!With any tasting menu, the courses and items may vary by season and even by the day. I can't write about EVERY dish I had because Yelp has a character limit for their reviews. I'll just list the highlights and lowlights (as if) below!The very first amuse bouche they brought was mussel on a half shell with a soup shooter. Best bite of food to start off a meal. The broth is out of this world. It kicks you in the face with flavor! Another amuse bouche I liked was the caviar with a tofu cream on top of a blini. Yes, Tofu cream. It reminded me of cheese lol. Such an incredibly delicious bite of food. I can't forget about the deep fried rolled wonton skin filled with the braised scraps of their wagyu meat, served with a sour plum sauce. It was literally like a perfectly crispy tender wagyu beef lumpia.I didn't want to fill up, but I had to have some bread. The bread guy recommended the brioche, which I now pass on to you readers. The bread is served with French butter, which is 100 times better than the butter we have regularly. One of my favorite bites of food of the night was the crab chawanmushi (Japanese egg custard). I love chawanmushi--a perfectly bouncy egg custard with a dashi broth (aka umami). This dish was better than the ones I tried at pricey Japanese restaurants. It was just phenomenal. Another great dish was the spiny lobster served with roasted sunchokes and a black truffle sunchoke puree. So aromatic and the lobster meat was so flavorful. I loved the halibut wrapped in pancetta. It was served with this phenomenal black truffle duck sauce, which was so good I wanted to lick the sauce off of my plate. Because the perfectly cooked halibut was wrapped in pancetta and served with an earthy sauce, it ate more like a meat dish than a fish dish. Nonetheless it was incredible.I need a separate paragraph to write about the A5 wagyu. Ho. Lee. Crap. It was so flipping delicious that it had me asking how the best dish in a seafood restaurant could be the wagyu. It's that good. EVEN IF YOU GET THE LOWER TIER TASTING MENUS, PAY THAT EXTRA SUPPLEMENT TO EAT THIS HEAVENLY PIECE OF MEAT.They give you the choice between a cheese course or an extra dessert. I love cheese, so obviously we went with cheese. They bring over their stinky cheese cart, and there's an overwhelming array of cheeses. The guy preparing the cheese plate asks you your preferences and makes their own recommendations. I don't even remember what we got, but it ranged from blue cheeses to more mild cheese. Of course, they're served with preserves/jams, figs, candied nuts, and breads. They were all so good.The rest of the desserts were amazing too. They all eat very light and not too sweet, which I love. The apple fennel dessert with a frozen apple sorbet on the bottom was the perfect palate cleanser. The Hachiya (persimmon) dessert with genmaicha (roasted brown rice green tea) ice cream and mocha was so good. It's the perfect winter dessert, and it'd be very popular in Asian households, where we don't do crazy sweet desserts. The Illanka (dark chocolate) with pear and ginger was the perfect chocolate dessert to end the night. I don't like my chocolate too sweet, and the pear and ginger make it just fruitier and more refreshing.They close you out with petit fours and muffins to take home. The service is phenomenal through and through. I will say that depending on who brings out your food, you get a different depth of description for your food. I'd be willing to come back here for more seafood and wagyu goodness!"}, {"review_id": "niqQyRSAYsJyWtxaKn8IRA", "user_id": "VUXm-VJzvzlU8Rc-AcjP6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "This has become my favorite restaurant in LA. We came here for 2017 NYE dinner. It was a set menu. We also ordered truffle paste in addition to the set menu. All the dishes were delicious, except this one mushroom dish. I had a mouth full of sand. When I told the waiter, after awhile a man approached me. Without apology, he started telling me it was the nature of the dish, it's fried mushroom. After a few minutes I told him to just stop. I've been to many restaurants in my life that I could tell the difference between sandy and crunchy. Then I asked to speak to the manager, this man said he's the owner/GM, I was in shock. Then he offered to do something nice for us. He sent over two orders of foie gras (one person each), which was delicious. All the waiters were nice.

And I'm pretty sure word amazing doesn't even do this restaurant justice.We had the current seasonal prix fixe and every dish was delightful! Not just unbelievably tasty, but a great presentation to boot! You'll see in my pics, but it's even better in person. Combine that with the smells from each dish and... unforgettable.Not to be forgotten, the service was impeccable.

I'm sad to say that it's off my list for favorite restaurants in LA. It was a last minute booking at 945pm so the chef's menu wasn't available. We ordered the seasonal menu with two supplements of the uni egg. The uni egg is one of their signature items. It's an uni egg. You need to be able to taste SOME uni flavor. But on that day, all I tasted were the croutons. Zero flavor of uni. Why make uni egg without any flavor of uni and just croutons? I can just make croutons at home with an egg if I wanted that simple, basic taste.What puts me off is the lack of consistency which I expect from a restaurant like Providence. I don't know if I should be happy or sad they did not f up my dishes but my boyfriend's because his dishes tasted different from mine. Mine was a little bit tasteless, but his was either too salty, or too sweet or too bitter or burnt. Like the fish skin was overcooked and his became too bitter. His wagyu was also overcooked while mine was just about right. They're getting one star because they didn't mess up the wagyu for me. And dessert was good.Overall, unimpressed with the seasonal menu. Maybe my palette is too spoiled and craves for flavors that create a symphony in my mouth which unfortunately, Providence is unable to do. No dish in Providence made me go \"wow, these flavors go well together\", nor have I said \"this flavor is amazing\". There's only one word to describe the flavor at providence: monotonous. I don't think Michael Cimarusti himself was the one in the kitchen cooking but rather some, passionless chef working in the kitchen.I love good food, but I absolutely hate wasting my money on mediocre food. I've had plenty of Michelin rated restaurants around the world but... like Melisse in LA, I guess there's a reason why they no longer have any. Utterly disappointed ex customer. The only restaurant that deserves to keep their michelin star is Urasawa.P.S. remove the two michelin star accolade from your website. And \"Best Seafood Restaurant\"? Even the tiny restaurant by the pier Redondo Beach serves fresher seafood."}, {"review_id": "AYqrU38enWBf7-Br41h65w", "user_id": "XTgl5TUDSnDMl45TeddRbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I had such an amazing experience. The service was the best I ever had, the waiters make sure to explain each and every dish in detail and makes sure that every time that when you get up to go to the restroom that your napkin is folded each and every time you come back. They will also come around periodically to scrap the table of any crumbs that are on the table. The food is super good and just literally melts in your mouth. We got the chefs tasting menu with wine pairing, and we tried all kinds of wine red and white from all over the world all of which were very good. We also walked away with taking two bottles of wine home with us. Overall this place is such a must visit if your looking to try something new or different or if you looking to have some good dining service, food, and amazing wine."}, {"review_id": "3M3SkAPdlBbm9LxhEPwBqg", "user_id": "6M4TSWnaZEjne9bZQAwMHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Providence has been one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles for quite some time now.  I have been busy trying the new and upcoming places in DTLA but made a reservation with my food partner as exactly 10 years ago I professed that providence was by far my most favorite restaurant in town and a had been back numerous times to be a bit disappointed.  Well last week I rekindled my love for this restaurant once again!Accessibility:  valet parking available and sometimes there is street parking around the restaurant.Ambiance:  5/5 of course it is super hip, impeccable, quiet, good for dates, definitely older crowd, definitely dressy.Food:  5/5 we did the nine course tasting menu with wine pairing and a cocktail to start off the night.  Presentation is excellent.  So creative, food placed on the plate so beautifully it really looks like art!Then you put this art in your mouth and wow... food is orgasmic and something that is very particular about this restaurant is texture.  They play with a lot of different textures on each plate.  Each bite has a complexity of flavors and textures! Oh so good! Service:  5/5 impeccable.  Bang for the buck: 5/5 well... this place is not cheap.  I suppose when you make a reservation at a restaurant of this caliber you really are going for the overall experience and not to count pennies.  Having that said.  For the type of food you get and the beauty and creativity if each dish.... I really don't mind paying this type of $ for an experience like this."}, {"review_id": "sY99as_zXecEup-gJVEiyQ", "user_id": "k6L4sBkl8CSfz4r8xUbHFQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I've been a loyal customer for years.However, I decided not to pay Providence another visit in the future due to the dropping quality and the sloppy quality control.I took my girlfriend here on 03/17/2018 because this place used to be her favorite spot for French cuisine, but the overall experience we had that night? Terrible. We ordered the seasonal menu, and three of them were complete disasters.The first one was the Uni egg - the one in the eggshell.The only two tastes I got from this dish were sour and garlic taste. I could not taste the uni nor the egg. epic fail. The second disaster was the steam fish with the clams. The only taste I got was bitterness.Not only they overcooked the wine but also burnt the fish skin. Could not taste the seafood at all, and I had to have two full cups of water to get rid of the bitterness.The last disaster was the Wagyu beef. It was the most expensive dish on the seasonal menu, and the Providence chef had to burn the wagyu.  The burnt end should add flavor to the beef. However, when I could only taste the burnt part instead of the wagyu, I rather there was no burnt end at all.I've been a customer since 2010 and was first amazed. However, the quality really drops a lot especially in the past two years.Not coming back for sure."}, {"review_id": "znIdgMDL_imZwOJdwGIQqg", "user_id": "zvSY4ox2x3H4n1QFGkcHeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Came in for dine LA- and we had the 7 course meal- very classy and fancy.
