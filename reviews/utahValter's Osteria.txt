This was one dining experience that I'll always look back to. The second we entered the door, I was bombarded by fantastic service. Valter himself was one of the first people to greet me at my table. He was like my not-actually related Italian grandpa. We were served complimentary bruschetta right off the bat. Then we ordered some nice wines and I discovered a delicious yet affordable Rodney Strong cabernet. We took our time figuring out what we wanted to order because we wanted to get it just right. Our server was great in helping us figure out what to order.  We had come to dinner with no budget but I really appreciated how she was mindful of price range based on customers' budgets. I can see myself returning because she was so transparent in how we can get the most bang out of our buck even if we had a budget. We ended up getting the carpaccio sampler with duck, beef, and a third meat I can't remember, pasta sampler, the veal, and the gorgonzola pasta, along with the limoncello gelato with honey. The carpaccio sampler was delightful, each flavor was perfect. However, keep in mind that it's basically one bite per flavor per person. The pasta sampler is absolutely worth it. You'd never think Limoncello pasta would be amazing but it was surprisingly the favorite of the sampler, I also really enjoyed the raviolis. The gorgonzola pasta was good but a bit of a letdown because it was overpowered by just gorgonzola. But really it may be a personal preference thing so take that with a grain of salt. The veal however was my boyfriend's absolute favorite. \"Best dish ever\" was his comment. I was too full by that point in the meal that I only tasted it as a microwaved leftover at home. But apparently, it's definitely worth it. But let me tell you, you guys. The lemon gelato drizzled with local honey is still something I reminisce fondly of often. It is the perfect palate cleanser, period, ending to a great meal. It's light, it's the perfect balance of sweet and citrus, and just enough to be the cherry on top. We also got complimentary hot chocolate that I loved. It's really thick and rich, definitely not for everyone's palates, but I thought it was indulgent, and rich, and amazing with the biscotti. Perfect place for a date night, celebration, etc. You'll get the fine dining experience that makes you feel right at home."}, {"review_id": "l6tRt4fGHbGPeowVolVdEQ", "user_id": "sUTjQ8B2QK_K8McXa4n8Fg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "There is no better fine dining in Salt Lake.

Had reservations for Friday night @9:00 PM for two and the place was packed. I think it's a great idea to make a reservation, not sure how long walk ins have to wait for a table.We ordered the pasta sampler, the fettuccine, and the eggplant parm appetizer. They first came out with fresh bread and an amazing dipping sauce (I think it was a mix of olive oil and Parmesan?). Whatever it was, it was amazing. Our server also gave us a small order of bruschetta to sample. The sampler was fantastic. You get to try four of their famous pastas: gnocchi in red sauce, two raviolis, and cheesy angel hair pasta. All were the best pastas I've ever had. The gnocchi were like pillows of happiness. The eggplant was good but not as remarkable as the pastas. I'd recommend getting the pastas instead. The fettuccine was amazingly soft but was a bit too heavy - I'd opt for a lighter Ravoli next time. Our server also gave us complimentary dessert, biscotti with chocolate sauce that was out of this world. Service, food, ambiance - this place has it all."}, {"review_id": "np4vkiyzK6a7cxfDLt1Csw", "user_id": "XItANpHKQO3MLgErEmSYsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "There is so much I could say about this place.

If you haven't been, I highly suggest partaking in an evening of fine dining. You will not be disappointed.  Where do I begin? Each bite of food was like an endless, mouthwatering experience. First, we started with the homemade bread and dipping sauce (soooooo good it should be illegal), then we were served a small number of starter plates including seafood, salad, and a soup. (these were suggested starter plates) followed by the \"to die for\" pasta. The Gnnochi boscaiola and linguine alle vongole were so generously portioned I had enough left over to feed myself the next day. Besides the amazing food. Valter himself makes the dining experience the best part.

I have been on every trip I have made to Salt Lake in the last three years and I will return every trip in the future. The handmade pasta, fresh bread, sauces, drinks, atmosphere, etc. is all perfection. Valter himself is always courteous and welcoming when he has been there and he goes out of his way to make sure each table is experiencing nothing but the best service. We request the same waiter each time as well and he is outstanding. If you have the time (and $$$) definitely try the sampler where you get to try a whole course of salads, meats, and pastas. It is hard to order just one thing after tasting how amazing the multiple dishes are on the menu. If you do go, call ahead and make a reservation (and get there early so you can hang out at the bar!) Do not overdo it on the bruschetta, bread and/or olive oil dipping sauce (early mistake on my first visit) and be ready to have an experience, not just a dinner. Lastly, ORDER DESSERT! The gelato is the perfect way to end the evening - in addition to the shot of hot chocolate they give you."}, {"review_id": "LK8b0G4_twUBLYviasB6XA", "user_id": "HYw099sWVo4WfR92gZnNDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "You would be hard-pressed to find better Italian cooking anywhere outside of Italy - Valter's is the real deal.

If you are visiting the SLC area and you miss eating here you have missed out. It started with making our reservations...I called a day ahead and got their answering machine but soon enough after the staff arrival I received a phone call confirming our time.  They were very accommodating with a larger party and even though this restaurant is on the smaller side they seem to utilize every inch with out you feeling cramped. We arrived for our dinner and our table was all set and ready to go. This shows me a level of care they put into their customers experience. Once seated I will be honest it was super hard to decide what I wanted for dinner because everything sounded so great and the same for the starters. So why not it was a special night let's get a few salads and the heirloom salad as well. I personally decided on the seasonal salmon special served with scallops, shrimp and a little octopus I believe accompanied in a surrounding of their ragu sauce. Either way this was an amazing dish and outside of licking the plate clean this was so delicious. But my co-workers dishes also looked amazing so I stole a bite of the salmon in cream sauce wow! and the pork medallions and another wow!  But what I thought was the tipping point for me from great to outstanding was the care the owner puts into making sure every customer is greeted personally and walks around to ensure everything is as expected and more.  I was blown away by this and shows why this place is a little harder to get into sometimes and is always packed.

The service: we arrived 10 minutes before our 6pm reservation, but they sat us anyway. Our server Brandon was kind, knowledgeable and very helpful throughout the entire evening. He explained everything we had questions on and helped us with everything we needed perfectly. The atmosphere: I thought it was beautiful and so fun to have the owner walking around checking in on us all evening. The food: I can't even begin to explain what I put in my mouth.  My husband chose the option of being fed by valter, so you don't pick your food, they just bring out your 4 course meal as the night goes along. He loved it. I actually chose a two course sampler meal. First course was awesome and I can't even explain what it was. Very fancy though ;). My second course was hands down the best food I've ever put in my mouth....and I'm told I'm a very picky eater in terms of what I approve as something \"amazing\". I chose the double portion of the pasta sampler. I ate literally the best ravioli I've ever eaten; a butternut squash and a brown butter spinach (I think). There was also an amazing lemon and spicy gnocchi pasta. It was incredible. Not only was the meal amazing, but the bread and olive oil sauce for drizzling was the best complimentary bread I've ever had at a restaurant.    They also give complimentary hot chocolate and biscotti. I wasn't a huge fan because the hot chocolate was pretty bitter, but my husband loved it. My husbands meal came with the gilato sampler. All were amazing (passion fruit with organic honey drizzled, cherry chocolate and pistachio). We left this restaurant completely satisfied. Yes, the price was a bit steep, but with a high quality meal like that, I can't complain about the bill. Worth. Every. Bite."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/valters-osteria-salt-lake-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
