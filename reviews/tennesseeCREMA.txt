I parked there to avoid heavy traffic by the arena & only paid $8 for over hours. Not bad considering paid parking lots usually charge more & if you park there during business hours, the first 2 hours are free. Again great if you're making a quick stop downtown!If you go beyond the parking lot & enter the café, it's a small but quaint space with plenty of outside seating & if you can, check out their roasting room if you can catch them making the caffeinated goodness happen!While there I had the Avocado toast & it's a*mazing & really take the trendy new sandwich spread to new levels!"}, {"review_id": "9Fo522EhCqSCnteZPt0teQ", "user_id": "7YXyAvDu_LGGwUVkh0QHIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Crema is one of those really cool spots that you have to check out when you're in Nashville and you love coffee. Unfortunately, I don't love coffee but I have enough coffee loving friends that I still checked out this spot an was impressed. They do have some non-coffee options on the menu and it's a great place to hang out and get things done. The Chai tea was great - the foam on top was wonderful, great spice level, definitely homemade, not a mix or concentrate. We had no issue with parking, and it was free which is a huge bonus!"}, {"review_id": "Gus9nM_5B7SsblMZ6AFenw", "user_id": "p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Ok so here's the scoop. I'm from Portland the land of coffee culture. Nashville felt a lot like a mini Portland, everywhere I looked there was Stumptown coffee and trendy little coffee shops. This one was by far the most bougie coffee shop I've ever been to.They get extra points for roasting their own beans, something that was hard to come by in Nashville. I tried a chai and it was just on the line as far spice goes. It was almost too spicy to drink, but I love a sweet chai so that's personal preference. I also had a blueberry muffin and it was delicious. My friends had other pastries and coffee from here and everything was great. I bought a bag of coffee beans to bring home to my husband, something I couldn't do in other shops since they were all Stumptown."}, {"review_id": "RRvEdvqhWZPsWjoE9nprjg", "user_id": "2Z3OWiP89FOJXriRqecv_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Very cool decoration and innovative drink. I ordered their Kashmiri Chai, a mix of green tea, Himalayan pink salt, jaggery, spices, and toasted pistachios. This combination creates a very special taste. It comes with a rosemary cookie, also very innovative. My boyfriend ordered a carbonate coffee. It is a citrus flavored iced coffee. I tried and really like it!"}, {"review_id": "AhZEPXJmNHh7VRMxK97fgA", "user_id": "ouBBPw3u_ALDVg2BIZ7rrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "The coffee here was so good!

The drinks aren't very sweet but they're super smooth and you can taste the flavor of each item, like coffee and chocolate flavors are distinct In the mochaThey also provide water in the dining area They have their own lot for parking and it wasn't too crowded when we went so there was plenty of space."}, {"review_id": "G2L9FdSA51g5I9ppnNjdZw", "user_id": "G1h1gHD9q31P4b-sIBoz6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "Pronounced Creh-Mah, I suppose...This is a beautiful space with lots of tables, a nice restroom, water, I mean, a bum's paradise. On my visit, I got a decaf pour over and a cortado, which are two things that tell me this place is more than legit. The cortado was excellent and the decaf was good quality, considering most decaf coffee is stripped of any flavor. The staff was also warm and they are always running around keeping this place immaculate. If you want some decaf coffee, this is where to go.

The coffee is delicious - I particularly like their mocha, as it has a slightly different flavor of chocolate than you might expect.  First two hours of parking is free, and the space inside is a good mix of socializing and working.  We were socializing, but I could see this being an easy place to come and get some work done for a few hours.  Would definitely be back.  A must see if you are touring espresso joints around Nashville."}, {"review_id": "y8srKxZvRaxe5HjDO36ieQ", "user_id": "cd7qk2vbfxGikk2fMlH8yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I never much liked coffee, in most cases I avoided it just cause it would upset me so much (or it just tasted gross). But fortunately I was traveling with two culinary/coffee experts who've been all over the US. They told me that CREMA was the best coffee they've ever had in the country! So with their seal of approval I tried it, and my god .... I LOVED IT!!! I never knew coffee can be so enjoyable and flavorful!!! I had a yummy Cuban and a tasty slice of toast with avocado with a sophisticated twist.The baristas we the best too, cause I know nothing about coffee and my friends recommend everything on the menu, so their advise was greatly appreciated. I can not recommend this place enough! GO TO CREMA AND GET YOURSELF SOME FANTASTIC COFFEE IN A GREAT ATMOSPHERE IN A FUN CITY!!!"}, {"review_id": "o78lc7YnxeAnDU180KKZeA", "user_id": "SCQbAVsTJsMH2F6n2aosJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "This is such a cute coffee shop. They have some interesting drinks on their menu (next time I go I'll get the Frida!!), and their shop features the coffee they use as well as some chemex products and other coffee makers. I got the Cuban which has sweetened condensed milk, and oh man, it was so nice. It wasn't horribly sweet, more like just a touch of the sweetened condensed milk. Their hot chocolate was bomb, as well as their mocha. Through everything, their delicious coffee shined, as well as the cute latte art!

They do things right without making the coffee ultra pricey or making anyone feel out of place in their shop. This place has a really cool vibe and some great coffee.

Immediately intrigued, a friend and I went to Crema to check it out.I love Crema. It is one of those coffee shops that I like to bring friends to when they visit Nashville. Truly, their hot chocolate is amazing. I usually opt for that rather than getting a coffee. One time I had their avocado toast... It's avocado toast. Their chai is awesome too.Seating is pretty good. If you are trying to pull out a laptop and get work done, it can be difficult to find a place sometimes (tables are small, some are standing tables) but it's a great place to chat over coffee or read a book. Crema is a Nashville staple, and the atmosphere screams \"trendy Nashville.\" Sitting outside, you'll get a view of the skyline, and on a nice day, there's no better place to be than on the Crema patio."}, {"review_id": "7Ht25geVfvf2NjU8cVkNPg", "user_id": "DJBuyVr8_0k78ydUgonYdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "ONE WORD: HIPSTERI have known of this spot because it's happening, it's like who doesn't know about this place...I've been a few times now and here's what I think about the drinks:- Cubano: My husband swears by this.

Perhaps it was all the build up like YOU GOTTA GO THERE. again, rating on this is just okay.- Iced vanilla latte: I think the first time I got this it was just okay also, just mediocre all around, but the latest time I got this it was SO GOOD.* I think I drank the \"milk\" or whatever the saying is.Now I'm basically craving it.

The macarons were almost perfect (one had a slightly better texture). The scone was actually appropriately baked, which only happens about 3 times out of 10 in the U.S. They put goat cheese on their avocado toast, which is completely unnecessary.Parking situation is weird because they say put a receipt in your car but my receipts are electronic with Square.
