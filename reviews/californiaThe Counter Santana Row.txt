I was very familiar with the Counter due to visiting multiple locations. The only thing that wasn't familiar to me was the Impossible Burger. Basically, the Impossible Burger is a plant based burger, but tastes like real meat.I went ahead and ordered the Impossible Burger with my favorite side of parmesan fries. Our waitress recommended the burger cooked to a medium.  I went on to go with her advice. Once I received my order, it sure looked like a regular burger. In addition to the burger, I had red onions, sweet sariracha sauce, swiss cheese, and spring mix added into the burger. I opted for Hawaiian roll buns. I just wanted to compose something simple so I could enjoy the burger. After taking that first bite, I was flabbergasted! The impossible patty did taste like real meat. It had a smokey and charred bacon taste to it. That's the best way I could explain it. You would have to try it for yourself and come up with your own conclusion. The veggies were fresh and the buns, soft and sweet. The parmesan fries never disappoint me.If you're a hardcore carnivore like me, I challenge you to try the Impossible burger!"}, {"review_id": "Y9XaGHFgkQYOueSAh0Pv6A", "user_id": "R67Km1jTsiP0Gt3gqTr08w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Impossible (Vegan) Burger was Delicious and Staff was HelpfulAfter a failed attempt at getting a vegan meal in a restaurant nearby, it was a treat to get a quick and delicious meal with good service.

I'll choose more veggies the next time I go. If I had it to do over again, I'd choose the sweet potato fries.

I was told that the wait was 30 minutes and was going to get a text message saying i'm on their list. I never got it. So i waited, and kept checking in... turns out their text notification system wasn't working. FAIL. I was a bit upset, but kept checking for my name when our table would be ready. Finally, we were ready to be seated. We sat outside, it was a bit cold and windy, but they gladly turned on the heater for us.I created my own burger, and it was okay. Medium well was too overcooked. Not juicy. Should've opted for medium. Service was okay. I felt that they were a little understaffed. Everyone seemed so frazzled. Some of the servers were a bit snobby and just didn't pay too much attention to us. I don't really know how I feel about this place. I would come back here if it was the last option out there. Otherwise, food was okay. service was controversial.

Got it with the cheddar and garlic aioli as well as an assortment of veggies. I have to say that with all the add-ons and sauce, the burger was savory and delicious.  But as soon as I ate the patty by itself, it was obvious it was not actually meat.  I would not recommend eating it by itself.However, I think if I was a vegetarian I'd appreciate the option.  My friend who is vegan tried it with me and she enjoyed it too.  However, for her, she enjoys a regular veggie burger more.  One more option, however, never hurts anyone.  I'm glad I tried it.I think The Counter is pretty great for a regular burger too, though.  So if you're a meat lover, you'd probably appreciate sticking with that option instead.  It's not going to hurt trying the Impossible Burger if you're curious though.The staff was friendly but the place is packed.  This is the second Counter I've been to, and it's a bit of a wait to get seated.  However, the service here is much faster than the one on El Camino, on the Palo Alto/Mountain View border.  If you were to try this burger joint out, I'd recommend this one to that."}, {"review_id": "42JQyImvwVWukdgsMvr00g", "user_id": "SD-QrpLAIqaMuC1KlTdjFA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Came here on a Sunday so it was packed with a long wait time. Said it would be a 30 min wait for 2 people. Wasn't so fussed though since we were already expecting it - window shopping around Santana Row helped the time go faster. Bf built his own burger that came with shoestring fries and I got the sides and the turkey chili - the chili had good flavor but it was bit watery? Like it wasn't reduced as much as it should've been? I really enjoyed the tots though. Nothing completely amazing from the dishes chosen, but I'd like to come here again at a different time to try other things too."}, {"review_id": "6S0XSfT_gj0XLtU5-JAtRg", "user_id": "BL5LpvgOQs5k7-KBVbzamA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "The Counter is one of the places where you ask yourself \"But was that really worth $12?\" Food is mediocre. What I really do like about the Counter is the amount of options! Burgers, sandwiches, salads, fries, beer, unique milkshakes (seasonal too!) and almost everything is customizable. You get a check list of items you can pick for your burger or salad. You can create your own milkshake. The prices are steep for what you get. Each burger is around $12-$13 depending on the meat and that's without fries. The meat is really juicy and cooked perfectly to a medium for me. But I found nothing outstanding about my meal. The sweet potato fries were just ok and soggy. The parmesan fries are a good deal though since the portion size is great for sharing. Typically service is good everytime I come here. I've had one experience where we sat outside and received no service for 15 minutes but they apologized and gave us a 10% discount. The waiters could use some improvement. Some of them come off condescending and when you try to catch their attention, they just look at you. On the plus side, the location is great conveniently located in Santana Row right next to the parking structure. They also have this awesome texting service to alert you about your table."}, {"review_id": "ftJoXscZzfjFfFtzwx7OeA", "user_id": "uaXtdzCoMxyownc-62TvEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "A great place for burger lovers!

That was a really bad experience and was quite hesitant to go back there but everybody deserves a second chance, right?After the bad experience, the manager got back to me and apologized and offered us to come again and give them a second chance. It just took us this long to return but we did and it was a fairly decent meal. This time we didn't experience any bad customer service compared to our first visit. Got seated pretty quickly and our server was super funny and nice to us. We chose to build our own burger this time too and the result was good. Loved the Veggie skewers and Shoestring fries. I liked these better than the regular ones. Hate the raw potato taste! Lol! Also ordered a couple of drinks. The Angry Pineapple & Sparkling Lemonade were quite good but the Bourbon Smash was super strong and not to our liking that much.Rating the following out of 5:AMBIANCE - 2Not anything spectacular like you would expect from a restaurant on Santana Row.

It looked and tasted like a real burger. Granted I haven't eaten meat in 9 years, it was almost too real. But I still thoroughly enjoyed it after I got over the fact that it was just vegetables. I felt the salad toppings it came with went together perfectly. The Counter is amazing as you can customize your entire burger or burger bowl. They really have it down. My only gripe is that their onion rings are really onion strings which is really a let down in my book. The shoestring fries were good and the sweet potato were meh. Service however was impeccable! In all I really enjoyed my impossible burger and am so happy to see vegan options in an otherwise meat heavy restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "9mpCParSVoMAgESGkXIPwg", "user_id": "DBJ4b1cU_21pM41uhyu-PQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "It's fun to come here and make your own burger.

The burger was decent enough but a little dry and not as flavorful as other vegan burgers I've had. It came with a dijon dipping sauce, but I didn't know what it was for most of the time I was eating and I thought they made a mistake and forgot to give me ketchup. The sauce didn't add much to the burger experience. I would eat it again but I'd opt for a different place first. The fries were standard, nothing special to them, definitely not worth the $3 they were normally. Our order also took forever coming out.
