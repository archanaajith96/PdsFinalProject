I realize choice of bbq is a personal thing but Zombie hit my personal thing on everything I ordered, plus the two samples I was treated too.For me, bbq perfection. Even have a white sauce that I got to try. Better than Decatur Al Big Bob Gibson's. Not sure if it will become a regular but it should.Try it."}, {"review_id": "ut8d9FRzNpwNdrhkZzhIxQ", "user_id": "TVo-CIoWrZ0ByJ4UjPbyhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "How can you not stop into a BBQ joint with a name like Zombie Pig?? It was a great stop for a quick lunch - you place your order at the counter and take your tray to a table, no bus service but that was fine by us. The portions are very generous and the prices great - for reference, a full rack of ribs for $25 takes up a whole tray! My friend ate about half and was in a food coma for the rest of the day, but was happy to eat the other half for dinner later.The hot sauce was very hot but not mouth burning as the employees warned us. I'm a wimp and thought it was way too hot, but my friend was tasting it by itself and had no problem at all.Be warned that there are no truly vegetarian-friendly options. The sides are a bit lacking, but the flavors of the meats more than speak for themselves."}, {"review_id": "vMQykF3f_E2JHq6bC1o1Rg", "user_id": "Q3zLMeLgmBpbFzp3yOoNcg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "So being from the south, I loveeee some bbq! My best friend and I found this place by the grace of Yelp and we had to stop in and see what the hype was about.We were immediately greeted by the friendly staff. My friend and I ordered the two meat sampler. Let me just say we had meat for days (well two haha). The portion sizes are great and the prices match up well. I'm also a self proclaimed bbq sauce connoisseur. Zombie Pig's sweet mixed with hot is just perfect.  I can't forget to mention how delicious those sliced pickles were, make sure you get a few on your next visit!"}, {"review_id": "M4Fq90_eUIGBxrrK58MVUA", "user_id": "Nm6awCgUDrfLyOb1zveKog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "Let me start off by saying the customer service here is amazing. You can tell the staff really enjoys there job and the customers as well. I stopped here around lunchtime on a weekday and it was a little crowd, but the line moved really quickly. Once I got to the register to order I told the guy that it was my first time there and I didn't know what to order. He went out of his way to make recommendations and also let me sample a few items on the menu.  After I tasted the pulled chicken I was sold. So I decided to get the pulled chicken sandwich and it was super affordable.I would have paid double the price that's how good it was.Not to mention the location is spotless! Super clean...I cant wait to come back and try a different item."}, {"review_id": "i9vsRua1o_H457rvJAq1Rw", "user_id": "zSjCj3R03Y2rSSUbvPNB_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Absolutely delicious with a big portion of food.

Must head back for more!!! This place had amazing BBQ.  It also has a very friendly staff.  I ordered a half rack of ribs that will feed two people easily. A half rack came with a hefty six ribs that were juicy, moist, and fall off the bone good.  In addition I got potato salad and coleslaw with the right amount of dill in both.  The establishment is very clean and the theme is one of my favorite based off the hit television series \"The Walking Dead!\"  Why it doesn't have five stars:  make sure you check your sides before you get home!

The smoked flavor, the sweet sauce, the fresh sides, everything is incredibly delicious. Too tough of a decision between the pork or chicken, just go with the 2 meat and have leftovers to indulge in later.  I've sampled the brisket and it's superb.  The pasta salad is a favorite and I danced when they began offering mac n cheese everyday.  The coleslaw is an interesting mix with a dill flavor, unique and tasty.  Price is a great value, especially for the quality and quantity of the meals offered. Adding to the experience is the professionalism and respect of the staff, especially toward veterans and servicemembers. Beer and dessert are exceptional extras that I love to enjoy on my visits.  Anywhere else just makes me miss Zombie Pig more, it's a favorite."}, {"review_id": "WP14qoFVkAFQOjwCbKLyQQ", "user_id": "Srcx-N19Js3Mn6LTmo7tQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/9/2017", "text": "We tried this place because of the reviews and we were NOT disappointed!!
