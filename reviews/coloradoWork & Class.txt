While this is totally understandable, a lot of other people who were walking up to be seated were very confused to see us waiting when the restaurant was nearly empty.When we did get seated, we sat in the enclosed patio area (wasn't quite warm enough for the patio to be opened up yet), and were very pleased with our service. Our waiter was very attentive and gave us some good suggestions.Happy hour presented us with $6 house cocktails, $4 select beers & $5 to $7 bites. My boyfriend and I both got the Blackberry-Tarragon Limeade cocktail, which was delicious! & for food, we got the Chicken Pot Pie and Vegetarian Chile Relleno, which were both very small, but tasty nonetheless.Overall, we had a good experience at Work & Class, but would have liked to see a little bit larger portion of the 'bites' on HH!"}, {"review_id": "dGlQSS-wQVOLZhNSJWN28w", "user_id": "pNanfS3gJthwH1V-4cQU-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Not sure why it took me this long to write a review. Work & Class is a top 3 favorite in Denver. They offer a variety of dishes that are meant to be shared. I love their Lemon Brown Butter Chicken and their Mac & Cheese. They have great appetizers such as the Peppers Five Ways and Albondigas. Once you sit down, your server will help guide you through portion size to share amongst your party. Tips: No advanced reservations, so put a name down and then either get a drink at the bar or walk to a nearby brewery. Additionally, only go with people who share equally and don't take all the food for themselves!"}, {"review_id": "lNbN-9eqAd_XyrBNcxmpug", "user_id": "igergVbJAOzh7LvkkZfr4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Favorite Foods:1.

Great salad dressings.3. Warm Chocolate Brownie - Hot and savory. Save room for dessert!4. Blackberry-Tarragon Limeade with tequila - perfectly mixed and recommended by the waiter.Decent food item: Duck-Lamb Albondigas - these were two really large meatballs with lots of great sauce. Too much for one person to eat but great for sharing.Disappointing item: BBQ dry rub brisket was very dry and disappointing according to my dinner companions that ordered it.Overall, I really loved this place since the atmosphere is neat and the food I had was amazing!  Come with a group of four so you can split many items.  We got here when it opened right at 4 PM and there was already people lining up to dine here."}, {"review_id": "hI2LE0n14N4qPg-rTv1Vkw", "user_id": "hq1Lvi3a2JAkvL__oqC7QQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Relaxed atmosphere, attentive service, & great food !

It's mildly sweet and savory with a buttery, fruity twist. Now for the baked Plantains! Covered in paprika and dusted lightly with, what I would guess Cumin, it's mild and savory upon first taste and gives way to a delectable sweetness that fills your mouth.

I love good food. I love this restaurant! I find it really rare for a restaurant to do really good New American Tapas, but this place manages to do that. I've never been disappointed in the food here. My only issues with this place is they don't take reservations, and the wait can get pretty long. It can get pretty noisy and crowded inside, but if you get the \"outdoor seating\" it's not really a problem. Green Chili Fries - Very cheesy. A little on the thicker side.Chicken Pot Pie - I loved that they incorporated chipotle into this dish. It gives it a good spice. Tempura Broccoli - One of my favorite items on the happy hour menu!Chickpea Croquette - must get. It's light and fluffy on the inside so it won't leave you stuffedMac & Cheese - I think this place does mac and cheese justice. I like pairing this dish with a good meatMassive Salad - I usually get the salad just to get tempura broccoliBiscuit - It's like eating the top of a muffin!Cornbread - I prefer the biscuit since it has more texture and crunch Plantains - Sweet and delicious!Meats - All the meats I have gotten have been great. The flavors really come through well.

Saw amazing reviews for this place so my friend and I decided to try for happy hour. We were glad to come right when it started because it got really crowded after! So make sure u come around 4 if you want to beat the rush.Food - Off the HH menu, we ordered the pulled pork sliders only because we wanted BBQ. The sliders were AMAZING and only $6 for 2! I'm still dreaming of them and it's been a week. For bbq, we got brisket, lamb, chicken, and braised pork. Everything was AMAZING and you should explicitly say if u want your meat done a certain way. I saw yelp pics that lamb was medium rare so I didn't mention it but it came out well done, but they nicely gave me another one! We also ordered cornbread and green chili biscuit. O M G the cornbread was out of this world AMAZING! Good bake on the outside and so moist (sorry for the people who hate this word haha) on the inside! Service - the best service my friend and I received in our stay in Denver. Lots of good recs on the menu, and they even took the lamb off our bill for courtesy which was very nice of them.

Came by on a Sunday evening with my fiance when we were in town and we were prepared to wait at least 30 minutes. To our surprise, there was no wait for 2 and we were seated immediately! It was our first time here so we weren't sure what we wanted to get, but based on reviews, it seemed like EVERYTHING was delicious. We ended up starting with the peppers five ways, which was so good! It came with five or so different types of prepared peppers, including some gluten free bread and pepper jam. It was a perfect starter that wasn't too filling. For our main meats, we decided to go with our waitress' recommendations and got a 1/4 of goat and 1/4 of lamb. Both were juicy and full of flavor- I'd definitely get both of these again. We also got sides of brussels sprouts and jalapeno cornbread. The brussels were yummy and cooked with pears, two things I had never mixed before, but found the two flavors complemented each other well! The jalapeno cornbread was pretty good too- it was moist but honestly, did not have much of a jalapeno flavor in my opinion. This amount of food (one starter, two 1/4 meats, two sides) was a perfect amount of two people and easily left room for dessert. We ordered a small order of the butterscotch pudding and also got the warm chocolate brownie. Both of these are a MUST! The butterscotch pudding is whipped and light, definitely not too rich or heavy. The chocolate brownie comes out in a hot mini cast iron and is legit still bubbling as it comes out. Nothing better than a warm, toasty brownie with ice cream on top! I'm drooling just thinking about it again!"}, {"review_id": "5LZzlLLFl1ECnKJ2zilKOA", "user_id": "S9_QFmgOvRY_cMbNnAB9kA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Way overdue review (I went back in August 2017).We walked our way over here from a recommendation from a local bartender downtown.

BUT the best part of our dinner was the whole trout. The entire fish is fried. My SO and I both grew up with non-American food so this fish reminded us exactly of how our mothers used to make it and we were brought back to our childhood. We also got the cajun-spiced chicken, but the fish was just too great. We would've ordered two fish if we had known how good it was.Definitely coming back here whenever I go back to Denver!"}, {"review_id": "OOaBUytr9ps3zFszgahLyQ", "user_id": "9LRFCIf065Yqdjsu6VnJgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Holy Cajun fried plantains.  Also all the meats.

The pork is slightly salt but goes amazingly well with the tortillas provided.The tempura broccoli was fantastic.  I would skip the peppers 5 ways next time.  For $14 dollars I was a little disappointed.  Oh well, I love peppers, so I had to try it.  The waiter was amazing and brought us out a spoon sample of their butterscotch pudding dessert.  After tasting the butterscotch I might head back here just for that alone.  Yes it was that good.I really enjoyed this restaurant!  My favorite so far out of 5 highly reviewed yelp restaurants in Five Points."}, {"review_id": "E_c8XVVk1Wt3ggmNGmwuDg", "user_id": "uHRtODBqrtI_iMRDIP2GkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "This place had amazing food and the service was great.

So many different flavors and not your typical just chicken or something. I think my faves were the braised pork (cochinita pibil) and the meatballs. I normally love goat meat, but their goat dish was a little on the bland side. The smashed potatoes were my favorite side. The empanadas were very well made, but not the most exciting flavor. The brussel sprouts are pretty good too, and a great healthier option because everything else can be a little heavy, like mac n cheese.The place is loud and expect to wait on the weekends. It's good to go in a group of 4, so you can order more things and share, yet you won't be too crammed in trying to fit a larger party. Our waiter was helpful and friendly.

The pork also comes with slaw and tortillas on the side so you can make tacos! The Brussels with sweet potato are good, but the chickpea croquettes are standout. We ordered them basically expecting falafel, but they are not falafel. They're crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and come with a delicious honey sauce. The jalapeño cornbread is also a solid choice. The summer vegetables risotto was amazing, but it's seasonal.
