Not only is the food a quintessential expression of the southern tradition in Charleston, the indoor and outdoor spaces both speak to this as well. I visited with some friends during arguably the most crowded weekend in Charleston each year following the Cooper River Bridge Run. Even during this busy time we only had to wait for 40 minutes which is not bad all things considered. While waiting, the best thing (and smartest thing for their $$$ sake) that Hominy Grill does is it offers an outdoor window where you can order drinks. We ordered a Blackberry Collins, Bloody Mary, and John Daly. The John Daly was my personal favorite, but I am also a sucker for any sweet tea and lemonade combination...add firefly sweet tea vodka and I'm sold. The Bloody Mary was topped with pickled okra (another southern staple) an olive and lime. For food, I ordered the Charleston Nasty Biscuit at the recommendation of our waiter. He said I would regret my visit if I did not get this and he was not lying. A large chicken biscuit topped with sausage gravy is exactly what I needed after a 10k race. If I returned again I would consider trying the pancakes like someone else at our table because they were huge, but this is truly a place where I don't think you can go wrong on the menu. Pretty much anything you order will be delicious. I am sure to be back on my next trip to Charleston."}, {"review_id": "17eD6h-XylRs79hDgbL2iQ", "user_id": "_pVIBt5YCMCo58QCedCBsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "We arrived around 1:30 on a Friday afternoon and were seated inside right away. Service was great from beginning to end.  The interior is fresh, clean & bright. Patrons consisted of young families, a large group of girlfriends enjoying lunch to hipsters and couples (young and seasoned). Our drinks came out pretty quickly. I ordered the John Daly (Sweet Tea Vodka & Lemonade) and my husband ordered the Mexican Coffee (Don Pedro Brandy & Kahlua). I'd suggest cream with coffee. The Fried Green Tomato BLT was excellent!  The bacon was thick and not too salty!  I liked that the sandwich wasn't packed with lettuce, less \"L\" and more \"B\" & \"T\". The Charleston Nasty Biscuit was sooooo good!  The gravy...mmmmm!  Brian literally \"sopped\" the biscuit in the gravy, it was quite savory!  The Okra and Shrimp Beignets & She Crab Souo were eh. Not bad but not on my \"I would order this again\" list either. It was a bit bland. Overall, we'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "Xk0O0sz7Ux7AbWMWV-T_FQ", "user_id": "EkcDDH12lkNANzyPBn4Vzg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "This review is so close to a 5 star... but I had to knock off one due to me not loving my entree of shrimp and grits. Yes, I said it I wasn't in love with the house specialty. Primarily because it lacked seasoning. Had to salt it and hot sauce it up! Everything else about the experience here was great. While waiting for a table we took our time on the patio outside and sipped yummy brunch drinks. Once seated our server was awesome. Very helpful on making recommendations. Our food came out fast and piping hot. Definitely get the fried green tomatoes, and I think it was called the nasty chicken sandwich. The gravy it's smothered in is to die for. And they make a dang good biscuit."}, {"review_id": "qa8e_G3zLm_K8YxH0g0NBQ", "user_id": "_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Tourist and locals alike rave about Hominy Grill. My family and I decided to pay them a visit about 30 minutes before they closed. The hostess was extremely accommodating and welcomed us with open arms. The restaurant makes you feel like you're visiting your great aunt's home, you know the one who really knows her way around the kitchen. I had the most refreshing glass of sweet tea at Hominy Grill. The fried green tomatoes were on my must-try list as a starter. Unfortunately, our server forgot to put in the order. The good news is, the rest of our meal came out in record time, and the fried green tomatoes came out shortly thereafter. Here's what we opted for:Cheese omelette (A-)breakfast potatoes (A+)cheesy grits (B-)sunflower toast (B)Cornmeal waffle with a pecan and coconut glaze - similar to German chocolate cake icing (B+)Hot chicken and sweet potato waffle (A+)Sweet tea (A++)Fried Green Tomatoes (B+)They only item that I could not try, but desperately wanted were the biscuits. Lard is used in making the biscuits, so I was unable to indulge. What I loved most about Hominy Grill is their southern charm, the ambiance, and of course the food. While we were there, locals struck up a conversation with us and gave us great travel trips about Charleston. Make this breakfast/brunch hotspot your first and last stop when visiting Charleston!"}, {"review_id": "rMQwuJmtnEU4aPidPoKtCQ", "user_id": "5l6csJmi1FX17oHuufivoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "First dining stop in Charleston and it was a great one. Just down the street from our B&B, we walked here and waited about 30 for brunch on a Monday. New to the south, we tried things we don't see at home...the fried chicken on a biscuit with cheddar and sausage gravy, called Charleston Nasty Biscuit. It's very filling but so great, the chicken is crisp on the outside and moist inside. We also tried the fried green tomatoes and a sausage biscuit with cheese. All tasty!The decor is cute, the staff prompt and restrooms are clean.

A group of us were in town for the Cooper River Bridge Run and wanted some filling food post-run. Of course this was an incredibly busy weekend, but the four of us got to Hominy Grill around 10:30 on Saturday morning and only waited about 20 minutes for our table. What I loved about Hominy is that they have a separate window outside that you can order drinks from. I ordered their Blackberry Collins and it was incredibly refreshing. Our waiter was so great. He had a vast knowledge of the menu and gave great recommendations. I had spotted the Charleston Nasty Biscuit ($12) while waiting for our table, and our waiter recommended it as well so I went ahead and gave it a shot. The Nasty biscuit is a fried chicken biscuit with cheddar cheese and sausage gravy. It was very tasty and I was incredibly full. Although it was a great biscuit, I feel that it was a bit overpriced.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed Hominy Grill, and I will definitely pay it another visit next time I am in Charleston."}, {"review_id": "gVHKjJK6U5QPI0RizT3Jeg", "user_id": "ptGOjQFFBBUijBoIBpEayg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Delicious food. I always go for the fish...if it's in butter or that amazing tomato jam...it's divine. The sides are always hot, filling, and definitely southern. I could eat the okra and tomatoes over rice every day. Not to mention the boiled peanuts, sweet tea, Bloody Marys, mimosa's, I mean there is too much to even type. The best review on here doesn't do it any justice. Come here, enjoy the service, the food, company...and leave with a smile. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charleston.And don't skip out on the chocolate pudding either.

We took a quick walk to this famous breakfast stop. We didn't have to wait too long to be seated. Hominy Grill has a quaint, homey feel that makes you feel welcome and at home. We ordered some biscuits to start with, since that's what they're famous for. Justin M. had a regular biscuit and I went for the pimento biscuit and it was possibly the best biscuit I have ever had!! For my main breakfast I went with the buckwheat pancakes which were out of this world! I'm drooling a little as I'm writing this and reminiscing....If you're in Charleston, make sure you stop here and get in early to avoid the wait! As we were leaving, the line was out the door with the waitlist. But if you get stuck on it, it's DEFINITELY worth it to stick around and wait for a table!"}, {"review_id": "EsuGQDUtu0EG5RuJoWY4fA", "user_id": "ELKiGiSrdbgo2TGJFa4O4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Great brunch menu...BeerMosa, House Punch, Arnold Palmers, Fried Green Tomatoes w/Ranch Dressing, She Crab Soup w/Sherry, Bread Pudding French Toast w/Bourbon Caramel Sauce, Southern Fried Chicken Thighs, Charleston Nasty Biscuit w/Fried Chicken Beast, Cheddar Cheese & Sausage, Chicken Country Captain Sautéed Chicken Breast Smothered in a Traditional Charleston Curry Sauce w/Currants & Toasted Almonds Over Jasmine Rice is what we had & EVERYTHING was dericious, but beyond perfect cause of the friendly attentive service team \"corner!!!!\"OMGosh, how could I have left out the Creamsicle Cake!!!!!!  Yummms....."}, {"review_id": "gli6bJNZro3g2RFyr94x2A", "user_id": "NWjOxPJuTuz7oWGBk-Q6ZA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "I thought Hominy Grill was overrated for three reasons:-the food was nothing special. I had the fried green tomatoes, which i would not order again, and Huevos Rancheros that looked better than they tasted. My date got a biscuit which he said was decent, but not the best he's ever had. -the service was lackluster. Our waiter was slow and didn't recommend great options. The southern charm was definitely not there.-the wait is not worth it. We got there twenty minutes after it opened on a Sunday morning and waited about half an hour, which is to be expected, however I would rather wait half an hour somewhere else where the food and service are better Overall, Hominy Grill was just okay. I probably won't be venturing back."}, {"review_id": "y02f0sCQfJoBRrMCyuAbQg", "user_id": "G6MB2Dq0jlPu3xkljmvQtw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Of all the restaurants on our \"Charleston Food-tinerary\" I was most looking forward to Hominy Grill.There is definitely a chance it's my fault for crazy high expectations, but it was only okay.

The gravy & the biscuit for our Nasty Biscuit sandwich, was great. Chicken was pretty dry. Pork belly side was salty and delicious.

Plus with all the reviews on Yelp, I decided to give it a try. Perhaps why I was disappointed. Hominy Grill was the first stop we made when we arrived in Charleston. Luckily, there was no wait so we were sat right away. I ordered the curried chicken salad sandwich and my boyfriend ordered slow smoked pork shoulder. Considering how much people hyped me about this place, food was just alright. Nothing special or extraordinary. I don't really get why it's so popular and it's a \"must try place\".

Our server had a great sense of humor, loved it! I ordered Nasty biscuit, fried chicken cradled inside soft biscuit and drenched in sausage gravy. OMG, i loved it and almost licked the plate clean.

As if we didn't eat enough we couldn't leave without something sweet so we ordered the chocolate pudding to share.  The pudding was more like a mouse and had a rich chocolate flavor and was thicker and creamier in consistency.  I am usually not a fan of either pudding or mouse but this was absolutely delicious.  Between the great service, phenomenal food, and warm atmosphere I would most definitely recommend coming here and hope to be back again!"}, {"review_id": "5j5PHIcuILCyQja5fG1Xsg", "user_id": "bJucWHsy7rkBF4fdrHLVOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Delicious southern cooking!
