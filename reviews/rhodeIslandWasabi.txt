Tucked away in the back of a strip plaza is this little gem of a restaurant. We got there on Sunday at 1 when it opened and the place started filling up pretty fast; which is usually a good sign. The inside had perfect lighting and the overall vibe was clean,chill and visually appealing. We were sat right away at one of the main booths, but they also have an entire wall of private booths with curtain closures, pretty dope. Nice that you have an option. The waitress came over and took drink orders right away and served them just as fast. I had the scorpion bowl but also sampled some of my friends drinks-everything was spot on and mixed with top shelf liquor. We ordered a bunch of different sushi rolls to share (they are half price at happy hour on Sunday) and Omg. Some of the best sushi I had ever had. So fresh, packed with ingredients ,rolled to order..just amazing. The crab Rangoon were unlike your ordinary dense version, so light and airy. We finished EVERYTHING. I honestly can't think of one bad thing to say about Wasabi. I'm so glad I tried it out and we're actually planning on coming back soon to try some different rolls!! :-)"}, {"review_id": "5RcUtR0oCkWp_YhFc3NNWg", "user_id": "io_M76rPJlewnCPIS0GV8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "An unexpected find for sushi at a great price and good quality. It's located in a shopping plaza on rt 2. Though they are open for lunch and dinner as well as take out, Ive only stopped in for lunch. I have tried a few such as the spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, rainbow roll, fire dragon roll and land and sea roll.  All excellent but my favorite is land and sea because I have never had steak and shrimp in a sushi roll. The flavors together are amazing! Their drink menu is almost as extensive as their sushi offerings. A must try is the wasabi sakitini, yum!  In addition to drinks and sushi, they also have a full Chinese menu and hibachi. I have had a few appetizers however I have not tried hibachi yet. The owner has been there almost every time I've been there. Both he and the rest of his staff are so friendly and welcoming. Definitely will be returning!"}, {"review_id": "brlfpg9b7vrTQqm6dADjSA", "user_id": "J9J21MJwIDEHFOCmmGhBfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "How great is sushi? And Wasabi does great sushi. Not only do they have awesome sushi, they also have some really great deals. During the week, they offer many of their signature rolls at 1/2 off, that's like 50%!! I also really like that they have several semi private booths. So this would be a nice place for date night. Oh and their parking lot is huge. So no worries about circling around the neighborhood to eat expensive sushi and come out to your car with a parking ticket on the dash...or your wheels are stolen."}, {"review_id": "p89VnXc8VNRhfWd15U59EQ", "user_id": "MuGxIIrcGJ7FnxU7kTPNBw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "They offer half price sushi and sashimi during lunch hours.

Let me start with the good: Their nime chow and scallion pancakes were some of the best I've had. The nime chow was fresh and the citrus dipping sauce was a perfect accompaniment, while the scallion pancakes were soft and a little bit crispy, which can be hard to do. Sometimes you get them and they're extremely soggy which thankfully these weren't.Now the odd part. We also ordered four maki rolls (spicy tuna, alaskan, cooked spicy scallop and sweet potato) and upon looking at them I realized that there were some mistakes. Our spicy tuna ended up being a tuna avocado roll, while the alaskan had cream cheese in it (I hate cream cheese in sushi) but was missing the masago. The weird part is neither of these two are on the menu as we received them (their Philly roll comes with smoked salmon and scallions, which this didn't have.) On top of that our spicy scallop roll only had scallop in it (maybe their version doesn't include anything else in it?) and we didn't find it spicy, so the only one that appeared as ordered was the sweet potato roll. All that being said, how was the sushi? It ranged from okay to pretty good, nothing that stood out and the roll issues didn't help in that regard.So either one of two things happened: Either someone else had customized a couple of rolls similar to ours and the orders got mixed up or the sushi chef was having a really bad night and was messing up orders, because our receipt did have the right items on it. Would I give Wasabi another chance? Probably, but if I order takeout again I'll definitely be opening the bag before I leave."}, {"review_id": "4lJgpI_IqEGlntuitReX4A", "user_id": "UnuFiG4iR1_ojxC8g4YwWg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Took Emily hereHad Crispy shrimp and vegetable tempura it was OK portion was small.  Garlic broccoli appetizer -  I loved it, was crunchy nice.  Sunshine roll special appetizer - it was good but kind of too big to eat the whole thing in one bite which made it awkward, seemed like  a lot of breading or something on top which was yummy but just too much after eating a few, maybe I would have it again if we had like four peopleSpicy tuna roll, I thought it was extra spicy which I appreciated.  The best thing we ordered.  Tables with curtains were cool!"}, {"review_id": "UqOiW9qohTYEtlUA4_nSFw", "user_id": "OKJBnneiAYbz6FdC7YTv4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "What can I say!

Philadelphia, Crunchy, Spider Rolls,  Hamichi, Ikura, Saba and not much else.....  But Love it...  Always great.The staff are all not from here, try hard but and english not perfect, and sometime service is a bit slow...  Not a reason to lower the review as the food is great....  Give it a try!"}, {"review_id": "zZ1F7MjF5n7dfRttgePiQw", "user_id": "576Av-omXXms2m5Xv4oLpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "Looking for a quick lunch and found this gem that had a huge sign on Bald Hill Rd advertising 50% off sushi for Happy Hour!

My usual local Japanese eatery was closed so I looked up nearby places and this was where I ended up. This was certainly a fantastic experience. Excellent food. Prices that won't break the bank but keep you fed. Lunch specials and sushi are half price. You can't go wrong with that. Great food, friendly wait staff, and great sushi.

I usually call and place my order then pick up. I tried their hot basil chicken both times, once as the lunch special and the other as the regular order. The lunch special was the better deal in my opinion because it came with fried rice instead of white rice and i think i got the same amount of chicken. The regular order i believe just had more veggies even tho it was a bigger size and not as spicy as the first time. Definitely yummy and the restaurant looks clean and very nice inside. The location is a little weird, i thought i was in the wrong parking lot - it is next to davids bridal on the back end of a lot. The lunch special is $3 less. I will be back for their sushi also!

Restaurant looks nice on inside but in a run down strip mall. Got a mai tai which was a little to strong for me. Then the perfect sushi roll which was good but the pieces were just to big. They should be bite size and they were way more than that. In addition to that they placed to much spicy mayo on top and didn't take time to drizzle but more of a ladle. Late but not least I had chicken fried rice, little greasy and not very flavorful, I have had such a hard time finding good fried rice since leaving the U.K.! There has to be somewhere that has exceptional fried rice in this great nation surely...."}, {"review_id": "d8KwaT77Ds_pd-OWO7Z_9g", "user_id": "G79E6xxcsDX_wgDBpWqo5A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/20/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I decided to try again and this time I had the bento box with the shrimp tempura and a Boston roll. It came with a soup or salad and I had the salad with ginger dressing. Dressing was good but way too much on the lettuce. The lettuce leaves where so large I couldn't fit them on the fork. Oh well.In the bento box, The California roll was good , but the shu mai i did not care for - too fishy. The shrimp tempura was fresh and crispy, however, the veggie tempura not cooked all the way through. The sweet potato was hard and the broccoli raw.Since the server never came to see how things were ( despite the fact it was not busy) when she came over as I waved her for the check I told her. She just looked at me and said should  the chef make you more? Maybe earlier but not by then.Boston roll was pretty good. Just basic but ingredients were fresh.Honestly little has changed since i first reviewed it in 2013. It's just OK. They have specials and deals so people do go,  but I am not tempted to try it again. There are too many other places that offer the same thing only better."}, {"review_id": "5WS5-7iEdmxfGZS1CgSF5A", "user_id": "ek2uesPTpuS3MaeRMRQP0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "Best quality sushi in RI.  Excellent hot and cold sake.
