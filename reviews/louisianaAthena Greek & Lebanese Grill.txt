It totally rocked because it had this wonderful smokiness to it that I rarely ever encounter elsewhere. Their falafels were exceptional as well.. close to the best I've experienced in terms texture and taste. The outer shell was thin and crispy and the inside was slightly moist. If you're vegeterian and passing through Shreveport, spring for their vegeterian combo plate"}, {"review_id": "CqNy3vluTDlokTyv3fVcHg", "user_id": "ztxZzdSXzkKRQnOx1VaSzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "It's solid Mediterranean fare but not five star worthy. The kind of place you'd stop by as a local when you have a hankering for it, but not someplace you'd go if you're visiting and want local vibes you know what I mean? That being said, the chicken schwarma sandwich I got tasted good, the waitress was good and I was left satisfied."}, {"review_id": "Cm4fJPdJq-HT_xsGTSAwvw", "user_id": "-594af_E7Z9VVjQc9pJK3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2017", "text": "My mom and I were looking for something grilled, and I found Athena Greek & Lebanese Grill on yelp!We were warmly greeted by a guy server. The ambience was really good to my surprise. We also got to pick where we wanted to sit. Ordered the appetizer platter, beef kabob plate, salad and their Lebanese sweet tea! We first had the salad which was power packed with flavors due to the awesome vinaigrette. I am impressed how authentic the falafel, dolma, babba ganoushj and hummus tasted! The pita bread was also warm and tasted good, although I think it was not made in house. The beef kabob was so tender and bursting with flavors! The rice was also cooked perfect and well seasoned! We didn't have room for their baklava but their Lebanese sweet tea was a great balance to our meals. I can't wait to be back!"}, {"review_id": "jNJEdRDK2XpQt94b7O-gBw", "user_id": "fqGdqAd2wTS0T_N5SXIhkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Athena's Greek & Lebanese is wonderful.  The wait staff is pleasant and the interior of the place has a warm homey feeling to it.  I ordered the combination plate since I typically have a gyro most of the time when I eat Mediterranean food.  I highly recommend this place if you want Mediterranean food as it delivers both a pleasant experience and delightful plates of food.  .

I love Greek and Lebanese food and it was 4-5 stars with 88 reviews. Impressive!I ordered lunch portion Gyros.The dining rooms are a cool, comfortable setting. The Lebanese iced tea was great with unique and fragrant flavor. Starting off right.Big lunch portion. Everything smells great and looks great. The salad was really good-light dressing, feta and fresh tomato and onion. A cut above the usual. The hummus was perfect. I've tried making it and could never get it this smooth.The shawarma was just right. I requested tzatziki and was really pleased. Request it. It is great. The rice is saffron and made the plate beautiful.I had to have baklava. You'll want to.I live in DFW and have several Lebanese/Greek places I love and this rivals them all. The service was fast and friendly. I reserve 5 star reviews generally for 2nd or third visits. I make an exception today."}, {"review_id": "wJbVSH5-PxIcxxz3Qb5RYg", "user_id": "5QzreUqXy1MGk6Mb_iYGCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "This is one of my top 3 restaurants in Shreveport. I've been coming to Athena regularly for around five years, and the food and service are excellent on every visit. There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, the hookah selection is affordable and great, and it's BYOB! Definitely recommend the falafel and vegetarian grape leaves as starters or a light meal.

I have yet to dine in but have ordered from here many many times through waitr. Very prompt with food making and I always get a good amount of food. The chicken the gyros plates are my fav, balanced flavors and  just tasty. Each plate comes with rice, protein of your choice, generous portion of salad, pits bread and hummus or whatever dip u want. I just wish they have gluten free options instead of just the regular pita though.

I love the fresh hummus and baba ganoush. The combination plate, which contains gyro and chicken shawerwa with hummus, Greek  salad and rice, is my favorite entree.. Can't go wrong adding a side of the Grecian dip. If you want a special drink, try the Lebanese tea or request the guava juice with sprite. The special dessert is a must. It's a flaky pastry, containing a sweet cheese which is fried to perfection and topped with rose water and chocolate. The staff is cordial and accommodating.
