We had excellent service throughout, with some great Austrian wine in a modern yet low light atmosphere that hints at rustic central Europe.Most of all the food stands out as unique and first rate. This is a meat lovers place, with lots of first quality choices, and you shouldn't pass over the starters, especially the unique pierogis. We tried bratwurst,  kielbasa, and two pierogi dishes. The sausage plates came with a cold pickled sauerkraut, that was clearly homemade, and just divine. The starters just blew me away.On to some serious main courses. Two of us had the heavily sauced beef medallions. The meat was tender and tasted perfect, and the little gnocchi sized dumplings were a tasty compliment. Another one of us had the duck confit, it too looked like a work of art.A great, innovative kitchen that works innovatively off the traditions of central Europe is hard to find in any U.S. city. Raleigh is lucky to have this Czech infused gem. I would love to come back to J. Betski."}, {"review_id": "J2CJLYngJ12bT2MNw8GVLA", "user_id": "MmQv7nXo3EKVW6ZbFBZ08A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I've driven by J Betski's countless times while in Seaboard Station and finally decided to give them a try last weekend. We went in on a Saturday and while it was busy we did not have to wait for a table. The menu is pretty pricey, but it's also pretty delicious! My husband and I started with the smoked beef and pork kielbasa with sauerkraut. It was awesome and something I'd get again. For our entree we split the chicken schnitzel with a side of spaetzle. Splitting the dish was the way to go and it was still plenty of food. I love tons of sides and the schnitzel did not disappoint, it came with a delicious German potato salad and a cucumber dill salad. Overall the entire dish I would order again. The spaetzle was delicious and well worth the $6 for the side. It's a hefty portion and I'd say more for sharing. We were pretty full so didn't go with dessert. A ton of tables were getting coffee and they brought french press coffee containers to the table. I think that is a nice touch vs just a cup. The patio is a decent size and seems to be a popular spot. We will be back!"}, {"review_id": "qGRAxsygbypvYfEXFhI4qw", "user_id": "H_vkN6-pHGb_3FUEUUJOZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Came here on a Friday night.

My boyfriend and I have been meaning to try them out and finally got around to their lunch. We tried a daily special of fresh Kielbasa roll with onions and peppers along with a sausage platter. The sausages and the roll were great, but I felt like I left unfulfilled. This wasn't because I wasn't full, but because I feel like the meals weren't well-rounded - just some meat and bread. I decided to try the Austrian Potato Salad but honestly, I won't get that again. I'm glad I tried it, but the vinegar is just too strong for me.Overall, the food is good and the lunch prices are very reasonable. I wouldn't get the potato salad again but it was a unique experience. Make sure you call ahead for dinner reservations; It's really busy at night, especially on the weekends!"}, {"review_id": "nHj2KOKEzdjlJkpQNUwwzA", "user_id": "HorQ90eiUPfnesQlIraaJA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/27/2017", "text": "This place is highly rated on Yelp, and really who does not love a schnitzel?Four of us arrived around 7:30 on a weeknight. It was not super busy.For appetizers, our table split the pierogi and the house-made (and smoked) Kielbasa. Be sure and ask for the house-made rye bread - comes with salted butter.My man & I split the pork schnitzel. Which was perfectly fried and salted.The highlight of the mal was the dessert. a chocolate hazelnut torte with crispy bacon bits throughout. One gal at the table said she would come back and just get that.And just funny, either our waiter was messing with us - or he is the only waiter in America who does not know how to pronounce  the word \"entrée\". he kept saying \"Entry\" - and I am pretty sure it wasn't a southern accent thing."}, {"review_id": "Mlx9VQAewjWpPPlzAzsAcg", "user_id": "zs7P3o9stNXPc8723alvHg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2017", "text": "We came here to celebrate me passing PhD oral prelim. It was a Friday evening and not many people here. We started with the famous kielbasa! It was really good! Dip it into the spicy mustard and wow it blew in your mouth! Love it! Well flavored and very juicy and tender! We ordered a German Riesling, also good!But I didn't really enjoy the entrees here. We ordered the duck breast and pork schnitzel. The schnitzel was just fried pork. It was a little blank if I don't dip it in the jam. But I don't like jam, too sweet to me. The duck breast was a little cold and chewy.We ordered the appetizer, which was again good!"}, {"review_id": "kbvgcpw3_wXnHIaZ6KpDMQ", "user_id": "KMNseXSQEU0ZUkepTHHFRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is a wonderful little place in Seaboard Station! You feel like you're transported into another place, not Raleigh, NC. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but the sausages are amazing. The dipping sauce that comes with the fries -- so amazing. Get the sausage all the way, they have great sauerkraut. After stuffing yourself, try to save a little room for the bacon chocolate torte. I'm pretty sure they pipeline that straight from heaven. It's only the size of a snickers bar, but it's incredibly dense and rich. It's best to split between 2-3 people, just because sausages are so filling. It's a small venue, so I wouldn't go with a group over 6 people. The staff are amazing and attentive."}, {"review_id": "Ezdnt6C6buaNFEW6oOkoJw", "user_id": "ZUN-Aikd0LAYfxskBJD9HQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Service is wonderful a and the food is even better.

I finally went there on a double date and cannot believe I waited so long!! The drink menu was interesting but did not disappoint. My boyfriend ordered The Kentucky Kiss which consisted of Maker's Mark, Maple Syrup, and lime Juice. He loved it! I opted for The Red Rum which is Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, Fire Cider, Pomegranate Juice, with a sprig of rosemary. I love rosemary and was excited to see it served in a drink. It was amazing!! As a table we ordered a few appetizers to share to check out as many options as possible. Everything we tried was absolute perfection! The Fresh Kielbasa Sauerkraut, and Spicy Mustard was a crowd pleaser for sure, but It was the Chocolate-Hazelnut Torte with Sea Salt, Caramel and Crispy Bacon that really stole the show!! It was so rich and dense that we could hardly finish it but so amazing that we wanted to lick the plate!!Call for a reservation as the inside of the restaurant is teeny tiny!! We sat outside which I was a little worried about because it was a little chilly but it was actually quite nice."}, {"review_id": "A2-rc7LmEHJAwElK7Mjdpg", "user_id": "-lMsWLJgxtpxu2FkbReFBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/22/2016", "text": "Okay I realize this is German restaurant, but this may be one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was a Reuben on a burger type. The pastrami was absolutely fantastic and there was a sauce on it that I'm not really sure what it was, but so good. A little on the spicy side. This burger is apparently only a special, so I'm going to beg the owners to put this on the full time menu. It was so Juicy and just amazing. The lunch menu is definitely a lot cheaper than the dinner menu. My girlfriend got a couple of brats and pierogis that were so good. The brats were so juicy and the pierogis were tasty and cheesy. The array of mustards with the brats were yummy and different. I definitely recommend this place and it's one of the best restaurants in downtown Raleigh."}, {"review_id": "LmW4N9Vdez6wZj8YUtl94Q", "user_id": "F3MPqGYQ1oLMKZe_a5R8Tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2016", "text": "In the 3 years I've lived in Raleigh (and even longer living in the Triangle), I'm shocked that it took me thing long to come here, but I'm so glad the stars aligned enough to do so. We stumbled into seaboard station with thoughts on going to Oak and Dagger, and then changed our minds immediately after parking in front of J Betski's instead. It was completely packed when we arrived, but the hostess told us to come back in 30 minutes to check on bar seating since a table wouldn't be available until 9:15 that evening. After drinks next door, we came back and the hostess was able to move around a few things to get us a table immediately - what followed was one probably one of the best meals I've had in Raleigh. We decided to stray off the actual menu after hearing the specials and went with some delicious baked oysters, a fantastic chicken appetizer with lamb sausage, and finally venison meatballs. Each dish was warm, filling, and extremely easy to share. The venison meatballs, probably my favorite dish, was served with collards and cheese spatzle and had the perfect amount of spice to add flavor. We ended the meal with an incredible chocolate torte, sprinkled with sea salt and bacon. A truly indulgent and rich dinner, J Betski's is incredible and will continue to be a great special occasion place for dinner - make a reservation in advance because it does get crowded on weekends, but you'll love your meal."}, {"review_id": "g_dU1QXHcDp590QI-RyXug", "user_id": "W-qq9mw_-SzT94fZtDJTow", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Our meal was good, but not great.

If you like anything about authentic polish/german cuisine, fresh ingredients, sausages etc. made on premise this is a MUST try.
