This was the absolute perfect place for the end of a long travel day full of crappy, greasy, tasteless airport food. It was light, delicious, comforting. I got the Shahi dinner for one (non-vegetarian), which was great, and a mango lassi. It was light but filling; I brought some back to the hotel.Service was excellent as well... not a lot of people there on a Tuesday evening, so maybe it was easy to be attentive, but they still get credit."}, {"review_id": "YEd7mq-JGEfy4pj1zufCrA", "user_id": "SVC520f-MDQYcpkJY2Zk-w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I had gone to this restaurant , and the young punjabi lady misbehaved with me .  I am having my buffet and they did not clear the plates till I had my dessert .The ladies were gossiping near the bar table all the time . J/ust once one of them came to give me my bill in the middle of my lunch , and that too without the usual bill folder. Ignored the plates :) .  In order to have dessert on a clean table , I placed the plates in the nearest available table. She comes to me tell me that \" you are not supposed to do this \"  . I almost laughed at the obvious callousness and ignorance to customer service .  Good news that there is another Indian restaurant in the city. Not sure how they got all the rating."}, {"review_id": "WfVcBPwkithSK9Viv59OVA", "user_id": "TzfIuq_55Bk2sGtZNRBYSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "The Chicken korma and chicken vindaloo are very delicious!

They were pretty busy and you could tell things were taking a bit longer which got our waiter a little flustered. It took a really long time for anyone to come take our order and when we ordered another drink it never came. The staff was super friendly though and apologetic. We shared the non-vegetarian dinner for 2 and it was great! You get an appetizer plater, rice, bread, two main dishes, and two deserts. The desert wasn't what we were expecting at all but it was still pretty good. I would go back again and don't skip the bread it is a must!"}, {"review_id": "hHFxSyUpF9_J2ilKughznA", "user_id": "QJQM2WV2B83EsI1RAU0cDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I love Shahi Indian Grill.

This place delivered. We had an appetizer combo, naan and butter chicken. Apps had a jalapeño thing that was really good. Samosa was good, same for pakora, and sauces were on point.I also asked for hot sauce, they had a great jalapeño green sauce, different from the regular one. If you like spicy be sure to ask for it.Butter chicken was good, though a bit spicy for my wife and also was dark meat chicken. Wife wasn't fond of that, so be sure to ask about spice level and if you want white meat chicken.Service was good, food was good, If we go back to Sioux Falls we will eat Henry again."}, {"review_id": "l2rvijqAC1u9rPjeQ3Xyfw", "user_id": "FfBdRU-Nnt6G0FUmATO-tQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2017", "text": "Delicious! This was our first time visiting. We stopped by on a Monday evening at 5:15. There was only one other table occupied when we got there. By the time we left it was just buzzing... most tables full. The server was very helpful to us as we weren't sure what we were ordering. My son ordered chicken tikki masala and naan, and I ordered a rice dish with chicken, raisins and toasted nuts. Everything was so flavorful. We will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "sfkTzG4HHQG4rkoY8paWzQ", "user_id": "sbBtkEmGTV24NaUE-21xxw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "This is a very good Indian restaurant.

And I don't say that sarcastically. I just would not have imagined such a large, well kept, clean and aesthetically inviting Indian restaurant in SD. And boy, were they busy for a Wednesday. They must have been 15 tables seated with several take out orders as well. It could also be that they have half off beer and wine on Wed. Contrary to what one one would expect, service was still attentive. Food did take a little but longer to come out but that's ok, since the complimentary papadum helps with the hunger pangs. I got the Goan fish curry and nan. Food was AWESOME! Fish was tilapia and very fresh. Gravy was aromatic prepared with coconut milk. Being Indian and all, I do know my food and this place was legit. I would come back here in a heart beat.
