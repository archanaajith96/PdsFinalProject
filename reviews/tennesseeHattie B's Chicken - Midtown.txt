ALWAYS Fried chicken over TendersFOODAs someone who likes spicy food, and where spicy is a default when cooking or choosing what to eat, I second guessed myself after watching Ugly Delicious (thanks, David Chang -.-).  I was scared that I couldn't handle the heat, hearing that a fellow Korean-American professed that it was \"one of the most painful experiences I've ever had in my life\" when he first tried the spiciest level of hot chicken. BUT after reading the helpful Yelp reviews I mustered my courage and got the Hot. Good choice! What we ordered:$8.50 Small dark hot chicken plate with black eyed pea salad and pimento Mac & cheese I would get this again and might venture to try Damn Hot. Hubby really liked the creamy saucey Mac & cheese. I liked the contrast of the light black eyed pea salad - slightly vinegary and cut thru the grease. Order extra bread!$4 for 2 Medium chicken tenders for the hubby - good but would order Hot next time$9 MIL ordered Southern Tenders with fries and cole slaw - if you can't handle spice.

Stood in line for about 30 minutes, got up to the counter to a waitress that was just flat out happy to be there (which is unusual for this type of place).

The wait is absurd- on a weekday at 3pm, the line was at least an hour long. It doesn't look that bad, but it moves very slowly. Parking is a nightmare and is basically nonexistent. I waited in line, while the hubs drove around for 30 min until he finally found a spot that wasn't 9 dollars/hour. You can order online and pick up sometimes, but the website stated this wasn't an option at the time I looked, which was a bummer. We were in between meals so we decided to split one chicken sandwich, which came with cole slaw, sauce, a pickle, and one side. We got it mild, which was a touch of heat, which was maybe our mistake. Probably should have gone hotter. We got the fries as our side. The sandwich was honestly pretty bland, without much sauce or flavor. The chicken was crispy on the outside, but wasn't amazingly juicy, tender, or anything special honestly. We had the princess chicken sandwich at Biscuit Gulch the day before and this completely surpassed Hattie B's- not even on the same wavelength! The fries were crisp and were better than the chicken sandwich.Overall, not what I expected from this joint. Maybe we ordered wrong, but honestly if you're going to promise an amazing, delicious chicken sandwich, it should be amazing at any heat level. I get that just about everyone going to Nashville is going to wait in this line to try it for themselves, so my review certainly isn't going to change anyone's mind!"}, {"review_id": "Sd84-cJU1584v3D8bbcjuA", "user_id": "RBQ2rtnMI93JuE8UyVBItg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Hot chicken. It's what you came to Nashville for and Hattie B's Hot Chicken is the place to get this local specialty.This is an extremely popular restaurant, it is likely you will have to wait in line for possibly upwards of an hour. Pro tip: If you don't want to wait, order take out! You have three ways to sample the goods: chicken sandwich, chicken plates, or chicken tenders. You can tailor it to your taste with different levels of heat, the highest of which is shut the cluck up!!! with a burn notice. *The burn is real,* the sauce is prepared with ghost peppers. You can order a side of it if you want to try, but aren't ready to commit, I recommend going this route for the spice enthusiasts. I went for the hot chicken sandwich, which has coleslaw, comeback sauce, and a pickle on top. The skin is super crispy, meat is juicy, and the medium heat was a perfect kick for me. The comeback sauce is a great creamy component to calm things down. This sandwich has truly got it all.The meal comes with one side, and my dining partner was nice enough to share his ultimately creamy pimento mac and cheese with me as well.Hattie B's is part of the Nashville experience, so hop in line and be a part of it!"}, {"review_id": "5W2EBSgi5g-Lo9tNFz4CvA", "user_id": "pnTiEaqM4slogpY97n9Kvg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "My homies and I did God's work ate four versions of Nashville Hot Chicken in one night (also using a double-blind study aka ate it at the same time on the trunk of a Toyota Prius) in order to determine the best one.

I looking for you, Miss Cayenne Pepper.*Meat Juiciness (3/5): It had some juice in it, but it didn't stand out when compared to the others we tasted. *Skin (3/5): It had a nice crunch and a slight sweetness. Not sure if it incorporated some sweet tea or sugar, but it is unique when compared to others.

I preferred the sandwich over the 1/2 chicken plate mainly because of the delicious sauces that were on the sandwich.

Once you get your food, there is very limited seating and it's unlikely for you to eat in. I HIGHLY recommend ordering pick up then eating at a park nearby. The damn hot chicken was delicious- great spice and flavor. The chicken was pretty greasy though, even for fried chicken. Potato salad with a side of Hattie sauce was perfect.
