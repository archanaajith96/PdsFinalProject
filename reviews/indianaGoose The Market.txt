I went for a yelp event but came back to grab some meat... Well seafood but you get it! The yelp event was in the area downstairs- the wine cellar. It's a tight fit but so much wine and a bar type setup in the way back. Upstairs is the meat counter and a small grocery area. For Mardi Gras, they had special items like crawfish and shrimp sausage. We bought them and OMG, I wish we got more. They were both so yummy. We did the shrimp sausage for breakfast and the crawfish in a pasta dish. So good! The employees are so nice and very knowledgeable. Ask them any question and they know the answer! The prices aren't crazy either. What are you waiting for?! Get over there!"}, {"review_id": "joXWT-xqeSpH_tds9S-lgg", "user_id": "Qn8LjfS9YNYAQTU1kil0mg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "This review is basically for the sandwiches and price and probably would be a 3/5, but I didn't want to disparage the rest of the establishment based on only experiencing one part. We've bought sandwiches there 3 times now and unfortunately the bread is too hard. I like bite to my bread and it's not like I have dental issues where a harder bread is not a possibility for me, but this bread is just unreasonably thick and tough. It has great taste, but I don't want to fight my sandwich and I don't want a sore jaw after trying to chew it down. The inner ingredients are top notch delicious, but that bread...Also the soups for the size are a tad pricey. I got a large beef chili and it was mainly broth, I don't know if I just was unlucky or it really is supposed to be that way, but it seemed like a lot of broth for $7 (I'm talking like 3 beans and one piece of ground beef chunk). I really don't mind paying higher prices for quality ingredients, so this felt a little strange. Other than that the staff is extremely kind and the store has a very nice warmth to it. But as far as ready to go food, we won't be going back for it."}, {"review_id": "84ZfqMVS3oH3TrBZCXf_XQ", "user_id": "ijz-n4u6zXZfF_IdV9Aapw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "This is a great little spot that's conveniently located just outside of downtown in the near Northside. It reminds me so much of the little cafe/markets I grew up with in Cincinnati. Why visit Goose? The Indiana love is evident, as they feature a lot of my local faves, especially B Happy Peanut Butter and Broad Ripple Chips. They have an awesome deli with handcrafted sandwiches, as well as gelato offerings. Best of all...venture downstairs. They have a legit wine cellar of sorts in the finished basement. The bar in the back allows for some grown-up time with a charcuterie board and one of the hundreds of selections available. This is such a great find and I'm excited to see the offerings available from Goose with their collaboration at Sun King."}, {"review_id": "e2FtW7LLU3TwWb_9JlwbiQ", "user_id": "iEm4iGkgzgeDDpn5WDBQCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Wine, meat, and cheese - Goose has what it takes to please!I stumbled across Goose The Market during my \"Amber Learns Indy\" travels a few years ago.  When I returned for Yelp's Vino Voyage a few weeks ago, I learned that Goose The Market is still just as delightful, as ever.  The two story spot on the corner of 25th & Delaware is unassuming outside, but surprisingly spacious inside.  It features a main floor deli & lunch counter, a basement wine cellar & tasting room, and even has an upstairs event space which can be rented as well as outdoor patio space for those warmer Indy months.  Goose the Market has a variety of goods available for sale, both fresh and canned/preserved.  If you're on a quest to create the perfect charcuterie board, I guarantee Goose The Market has everything you need.  Artisanal cheeses, raw unfiltered honey, and salmon pastrami are just a few of the delights awaiting your palate.  Don't forget about the wine & beer - They've got it!  And now, you can even purchase your favorite imbibe-ables on Sundays (Thanks Indiana!)."}, {"review_id": "hAlwutOHsJTLwHsUmtoTVw", "user_id": "I-JKKX7PHHd_z9nNMkH6kg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "Came here tonight for Vino Voyage. This. Is. My. Event! Seriously, there are only so many things that surpass my love of wine, cured meats, cheese, and gelato. I had the opportunity to try all four here! To start off, I have wanted to come here for a long, long time. Now I'm pumped to come back for the other 5 wine tastings! When I first walked in, it smelled so good and savory. I was surprised at how many people showed up/fit into the cellar but I did find it a bit crowded. Tonight was Italy; there were 4 whites and 4 reds. Being a habitual red drinker, I really enjoyed the variety! (I typically drink Argentine Malbecs). I was open minded with the white and I didn't really dislike any of them. I ended up purchasing the Tuscany Rosso blend. Among the wine, several different cheeses and meats were sampled. The fennel sausage was great and I was a huge fan of the Brie they had. Fontina cheese was delicious too! This would be a wonderful place to come and have a late lunch or dinner with a couple of glasses of wine. P.S. They sell Kentuckyaki bourbon sauce here! You can take the girl outta Kentucky...."}, {"review_id": "MivczhElprx5pBN_MpkHhg", "user_id": "ABmON7bUDVTxnSst_0_7Hw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "The basement bar & downstairs charcuterie/cheese serving area is one of the most unique spots in all of Indianapolis.

We've been here many times & have always enjoyed the personal service in an intimate setting where the server often explains the various menu items.

They're cool, creative and just true foodie artisans. They sell everything local - B. Happy Peanut Butter, BroadRipple Chips, Mile Square Coffee, Chocolate for the Spirit, tons of local beers, baby pies.... and that's just other bizs' stuff. Goose offers the freshest meats, in a huge variety. They have cheese connoisseurs who can help you choose the cheese right for you. They make amazing sandwiches and also serve gelato. My current favorite sandwich is their new \"Love Handle\" sandwich that has brisket, Swiss raclette cheese, salsa verde and STRAWBERRIES. Yes, it is amazing. Goose is also constantly holding cool events. For Christmastime, they're having a \"chestnuts by the fire event\" that will include melting cheese over a fire, roasting chestnuts and a local school Christmas choir. They also have cheese classes, charcuterie classes, and are super involved in the community. Bonus: they have an upstairs apartment that they've begun using as an event space. They've been hosting biz Christmas parties and have loads of ideas for potential events (it's an awesome, huge space with a big kitchen area and bar, and could probably hold 40 people-ish)."}, {"review_id": "7SYgrqRuq9l8OaEfhhg5UA", "user_id": "mcx0aeOgvt4Yul5lrvLPeg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "After living in Indy for ten years I finally tried Goose The Market. The atmosphere as you first walk in is super intriguing and inviting. The employees behind the counter were very friendly and asked what we were looking for. We stopped to get some sandwiches for dinner. Being my first time in, I had a lot of questions about their business and the employees answered them all. They also helped us pick out two sandwiches. we went with a staple sandwich that's always on their menu and one of their rotating options. Both were great but the one that is always on their menu was waaaay better. We went downstairs to very their wine and beer selection and loved that they have the option to build your own six pack of beer. They also have a small deli downstairs as well. I can't wait to visit this establishment again. My pup also loved the pigs ear that I brought her back!

They do almost everything in house, but source out products that have a long history of being the best. Their smoked meats, prime cuts, nduja, homemade encased meats, sandwiches, and beer selection are top notch. Expect elk sausage with dried blueberries, their version of spicy paprika Spanish chorizo, homemade andouille, lamb bacon, and salmon pastrami. Come for a nice charcuterie spread to go, enjoy a memorable sandwich, and get some cuts to cook at home and you will be enlightened and become a true believer in their artisanship.

Both signature sandwiches are delicious. The Goose is loaded with mozzarella and prosciutto and the Batali can best be described as salami and a spicy Italian salad on delicious bread. The rotating sandwiches are always interesting and filled with well selected cheeses and house smoked meats. They cut the sandwiches in half which is perfect for sharing an assortment with a friend. Or not sharing and eating all of them. Going in person is always a fun experience. The display case is beautiful and evokes memories of shopping the European markets. I love the basement area to enjoy my sandwich or to grab a beer and charcuterie plate.

I mean gelato! Hallelujah! We were at a nearby park and searching for a place with ice cream. I wondered if Goose The Market might have something, so we set off to this tiny store tucked into the Fall Creek neighborhood. I was hoping for anything cold that resembled ice cream -- just something to shove into the mouths of the children I was with who were pleading for ice cream on a hot summer's day. Luckily, this place had ice cream (gelato), and, doubly luckily, they had COTTON CANDY ice cream (gelato). I thank the Lord that Goose The Market had the presence of mind to include a gelato choice that is artificially colored bright pink and blue. You know, for kids. Now, they do not have cones, just so you know. They serve their gelato in cups. But they include tiny neon-colored spoons, so that's fun. We visited on a Sunday, so we didn't go downstairs to see all the alcohol they offered on the lower level. (Dang you, Indiana, and your ridiculous alcohol laws.) But we will be back on a day that's not Sunday, that's for sure."}, {"review_id": "6m4qr_UpwhR6-P-yfpCH4w", "user_id": "lOk9f52Wt3ykeWtohV1ICQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/25/2017", "text": "I love Goose!

The soups and gelato are worth special mention as well.A rotating menu of sandwiches ads to the allure of this place; I love to be surprised by the day's specials.

That's a deal!.These people obviously enjoy what they do.Before I left, I couldn't resist ordering some prosciutto to go; I asked for it to be sliced paper thin by the employee, and she did.But what impressed me more was, the way she meticulously placed each slice in a separate piece of clear wax paper before wrapping the entire stock in heavy Brown \"butcher paper\".
