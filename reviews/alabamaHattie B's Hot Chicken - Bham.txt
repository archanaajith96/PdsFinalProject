White plate which came with a breast/wing quarter topped w/ a pickle chip, two sides (I got the pimento Mac & cheese and Potato salad), & a slice of bread (placed under the chicken so it soaks up all the goodness). The chicken lived up to my expectations & THEN SOME! If you can't handle heat like me, stick to the \"Southern\" flavor (no heat). I ordered the mild and it had quite a kick to it. The mac & cheese was pretty good, nothing extraordinary. The potato salad could've used a bit more seasoning. I'm not quite sure exactly what was missing but something was. I didn't come for the sides so that wasn't a turnoff for me. This is definitely a must have when you're in the Birmingham area!"}, {"review_id": "_MeHvcQj2jALyiZJ4bLfxw", "user_id": "torf1IhnkjDeqoJWWXp4hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I was visiting Birmingham for a weekend, and one of my Lyft drivers said I had to try Hattie B's. Thus, I stood in line and was expectant. The line moves fast so don't let that discourage you. If there's a line, that's a good sign. I went with the chicken finger platter (mild) and a side of mac and cheese and cole slaw. The cole slaw balanced out the salty and greasy chicken,  while the mac and cheese was just plain delicious. This is a great place to go with friends and family or alone if you're purely interested in eating good food. I was dancing in my chair because the chicken was so good. I hope no one was staring.Also, the portions are huge. I could have easily gone with the kid's meal but I didn't see it as an option."}, {"review_id": "qHc5JdaUQswn3ZTqwMmObQ", "user_id": "B_oFXMWHwzGRTjPG5p5Hyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Chicken at its best!If you ever get a chance to visit a Hattie B's you definitely need to take it.  I have eaten at one in Nashville and this week in Birmingham.  HOT chicken, pimento Mac and cheese, homemade potato salad and a clean friendly atmosphere.

Like SO MUCH.I had always heard about it in Nashville, but the one time I tried to go the line was so crazy that I passed. When I found out there was a location in Bham, I was dying to try it. I've been three times now, and every experience has been incredible. The line hasn't been too long, and the people taking your order up front are cool and friendly. There is seating inside and outside--I have eaten once inside and twice outside. The staff will bring you your food, but they don't wait on you. You get your own drink. They have awesome sweet tea and lemonade that I recommend you try! I get the tea and my husband gets the lemonade. The chicken is a-maaay-zing. Each time I have visited I have ordered the chicken sandwich (medium hotness) with fries. The sandwich is enormous and comes topped with slaw and pickles, which is such a tasty combination. I didn't think I would like having slaw and pickles on my fried chicken, but I really think Hattie B's knew what they were doing when they made that sandwich! The coleslaw helps to cool down the heat of the chicken and adds great flavor. The pickles give a nice crunch. The fries are super-seasoned and great for dipping in their ranch sauce. Y'all. I cannot rave about this place enough. It has become the place I stop at whenever I am driving through Bham. You've got to go. The ONLY negative is that parking can be a bit tricky depending on when you go there. Just keep looping around, though, and you'll eventually find a spot."}, {"review_id": "OtBVprtsnNrr5JOUszwBhA", "user_id": "HzXGCvptYN9q6DXMJ6Wi6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "We were out partying in the neighborhood and got the munchies. We decided to go somewhere new so we went here. We ordered the white plate with Mac n cheese and baked beens. We got it middle of the road spicy. When we got our meal it was hot fresh out of the fryer. We had to sit there teased by the delicious aroma but stayed by the thought  of a blistered mouth. Once we dug in it was delicious. The chicken was moist and the crust crispy and light. The mild sauce had a nice soft burn to it. Those that are not to fond of spicy hot food should probably order the chicken without sauce and get a few on the side to try so when you return you will know what you like.I thought we got a good size serving of chicken and at a fair price. So if you get the munchies later in the night try them out. But remember they close at 10 on weeknights  and midnight on Fri and Sat."}, {"review_id": "90NS6WoEguf8OkIqrI9OiQ", "user_id": "G1h1gHD9q31P4b-sIBoz6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "How can you drive by a Hattie B's and not stop to get some chicken?

It's good, although that other chickin franchise (wink wink) has an awesome spicy chicken sandwich, and it is way less pricey.

That being said, my hubby wanted to give it a try.  We shared a half chicken medium heat with potato salad and pimento Mac and cheese with a side of hot seasoning. The chicken looked crispy, but I can't say because I didn't eat anything but a small portion of the thigh meat and NO skin! My hubby said is was not spicy at all and lacked depth of flavor. The sides were mediocre at best with the potato salad having no discernible flavor at all.

Our go to is half a chicken (we share) and two sides. Very economical, and we both have plenty of food to eat. If we're extra hungry, we get an extra side, but that's very rare. Ordering is easy, and by the time you get your drinks and find a table, the food is heading out of the kitchen! We've only sat inside thus far, but the outside area is always a popular spot, and with the heaters, it seems warm enough for cool evenings. We love the macaroni and cheese, as well as the greens! We've only gotten the chicken \"mild\" and it's very good and tolerable for both of us!

I know this is the Bible belt, but goddamnit this is also fried chicken!So I pulled out my map and typed in fried chicken and this place was recommended. I don't know what that other place might have been able to offer me in terms of fried chicken but I can't imagine a plate of Yardbird being done any better than this.I ordered the large white meat dinner plate with turnip greens and baked beans. It was absolutely wonderful. The chicken breasts were large, flavorful, and not greasy. I left nothing behind but cartilage and bones. I could go on anon but frankly, after that meal I'm too tired and I need a nap. Go there and see if yourself. This was outstanding.

Hattie B's is the only place that delivers on HOT chicken. Not that wimpy \"white people spicy\" bs, but actual \"wow I can't feel my taste buds\" heat. I usually get the Damn Hot (second hottest) tenders and ask for a side of the \"Shut The Cluck Up\" to dip my fries in. I love how spicy their sauces are, and the quality is consistently good! I find that food is better on nights/days they're not as busy (high volume = lower quality). But the chicken is always tender, juicy and delicious, and I love how crispy the fries are. Their Sunday brunch (chicken and waffles) is also a great hit.Hattie B's is definitely my favorite guilty pleasure, and arguably the best fried chicken in town.

Soooo... I finally stopped in and ordered the large dark plate and jumbo tender plate to-go.  After reading the reviews on the spice level and from the advice of the staff, I decided to play it safe and went with the \"medium\" spice level.  Unfortunately, they were not serving fries due to issues with their fryer, which was okay because the potato salad and collard greens were pretty tasty.  The staff was quite welcoming and helpful, my food order was ready within minutes (much quicker than expected), and my hubby and I enjoyed every bite!  Despite the TSA agents offering to pay me for the securely bagged plates, I was able to make it home to the hubby to deliver his prized obsession. The chicken portions were huge- even the chicken tenders.  The medium spice level was actually not bad at all- it was the right amount of spice for someone that doesn't eat spicy food often. Now that I know there's a location in Atlanta as well, I'll swing by the next time I'm there."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hattie-bs-hot-chicken-bham-birmingham?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
