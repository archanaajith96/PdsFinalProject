Toted as one of the premier locations for wine and cheese, I assumed it was too fancy for my plebian taste buds. I don't know much beyond \"red, white, and sparkling\" when it comes to wine, and while I absolutely love cheese, that's not saying much. Mostly because I love all foods. All this to say - I was completely wrong in my assumptions about Tria, and I cannot wait to get back. Throw away the conventions that this wine/cheese bar is merely for the fancy folk. I showed up in sweats midday on a sunny Saturday (the plan was to go for a run, but we ended up at Tria), and I did not feel out of place at all. However, the ambiance is really nice and classy, so it could definitely be fancy if you wanted it to be. This location (as there are two others in the city) is pretty small. Table seating is limited, but there is bar seating available if you're lucky enough to snag two or three next to each other. Ideally, this place is geared towards parties of 4 or less. There's not really a lot of space, and the waits can be pretty lengthy if you're just planning for an impromptu visit. My one complaint about Tria is they don't have a huge space available to wait for your table, and they don't take cell phone numbers. Which means you have to carefully time it if you decide to wander away. We waited about 40 minutes for our table around 2pm on the weekend, and the place never really hit a slow point. Worth the wait though.In regards to food, wine, and cheese? Amazing. Incredible. The bruschetta was to DIE for: we tried the Goat Cheese and Pesto and the Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey. Both bursting with flavors. I could easily make a meal of just their bruschetta options. If you make it past their snacks and bruschetta, be sure to check out their gourmet sandwiches, salads, and desserts. It was pretty difficult to make a decision, but I settled on the Prociutto Cotto Panino topped with Grana Padano and fig jam. The fig jam added a whole new level: an amazing combo of sweet and salty. The sandwich was hot, huge, filling, and delicious. You can tell every ingredient offered here is of the highest freshness and quality. Even in my sweats, with limited knowledge of wine and cheese, I never felt like I didn't belong. Both the wine and cheese menu are organized in a way that even the most ignorant foodies can identify something(s) they'd like; and if you don't? The staff was kind, accommodating, and knowledgeable. I'm counting down until my next visit to Tria. Central to downtown, it's close to shopping, Rittenhouse park, and other bars. It's the perfect place for a girl's lunch or a romantic date, but you can also come here in yoga pants and go hog. You won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "i1sbMGJoHeZiqioST6T3xw", "user_id": "92Mj-5aFGuX65rLp0ujX1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "I love all the Tria locations.

The staff is so extremely knowledgeable and helpful with choosing the perfect glass to suit your tastes. The wine selection is varied and diverse. Tonight I ordered 2 glasses and the other in my party ordered 4 (!!) so I had the privilege of a tasting of several varieties (sparkling pink, white, light & full bodied reds).  Great quality wine, excellent selection, top notch service. The food is also high quality and very tasty. We enjoyed the roasted almonds with fennel salt, shrimp toast, smoked salmon salad and mushroom Brie panini. Every dish was worth writing home about!! I had a similar experience last summer with different servers, so the high quality drink, food and service is consistent. Definitely one to keep on the rotation!"}, {"review_id": "8mH9e8EyDQYj_ADySacypg", "user_id": "68HmYA87q-JPnUY23u6DsQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "A true millennial snack hotspot just a short walk from the millennial frequented art museum, Magic Gardens. After appreciating the quirky and unique mosaics at Magic Gardens, head over to Tria for a glass of recommended wine and a delicious fresh appetizer (vegan offerings also). I tried the Brie and cherries Bruschetta and it was perfect paired with the white wine of the day. Their diet cola offerings are not the typical branded diet cola but an off-the-beaten-path low sugar bottled cola from NY. The whole experience was fresh, hip, and memorable discovering the no-frills, no-establishment choices of a true millennial restaurant.

I was sold on the location and yelp rating (classic). After entering the establishment, I made my way to the high tops along the back wall. After thrusting myself up onto the stool, my very first observation was a gigantic pile of lettuce behind the counter in the back. I guess 2 or 3pm something on a Saturday afternoon is dinner/evening preparation time. Fortunately, other than being easily distract-able from ADD, there were no negative implications of the lettuce jungle on my experience. The drink menu is diverse. My companion went with a wine, I a beer to start. I was actually starving but didn't want to get crazy with it off the bat. I did however notice many delicious food offerings make their way from the kitchen to other tables. My salivary glands rumbled noticeably. Eventually my appetite overcame me, oozing out of very orifice. I glanced over to the menu. Ho-boy. Just wait until you check out what they're offering up in this place. After thorough deliberation because it's very hard to choose with all of the mouth watering choices, I made my selection. I wanted something hard in the mouth and crisp on the tongue. Fortunately they have a vasy array of bruschetta. I went with the pistachio herbed ricotta bruschetta (w/ lavender honey) for $5.5 over the goat cheese pesto $5.5 at the suggestion of the waitress. Dining companion ordered warm poached black mission figs with gorgonzola and prosciutto for $7.5. PS- after initial submission of this review I realized aside from talking about myself and what I ordered, I never described the actual food. It was DELICIOUS. The ricotta was smooth and flavorful. Bread crisp and hard on the tongue. I did observe some really good looking shit with chips I couldn't figure out what it was from the menu. I also heard through the grapevine that the truffled egg toast is to die. Anyways, definitely down to come back to try more stuffUPDATE: Came back to this place to try other stuff.I met some of mah gUrLzZzZzZ here yesterday at 4pm on a wednesday for hh.I ordered a pumpkin ale, brewery of which something weyer-something-or-other. Slightly too intense for me. Companions ordered wine. I subsequently ordered a milk stout. Delicious. For edible options we ordered \"fancy chips\" which are basically crispy chips with seasoning and this orgasmic green aioli-type dip. We also went with the FAMOUS and CLASSIC truffled egg toast. I'm not particularly keen on salmonella in liquid form but this was delicious. I barely even noticed the yolk. Bread was the perfect lecture, cheese added a nice flavor, and the yolk seeped in just enough without causing too much of a sog. We also ordered one of the cheeses, something that started with an e and I chose it particularly because it was difficult to pronounce. It was served with a fruit jam and 500 slices of baguette that was replaced when we were running low on the first batch."}, {"review_id": "_wsA_PjWWJT82L-Lw6GIBA", "user_id": "bDsV-2R4PEfvq7Q8cXHqKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "My in-laws were in town over the summer, which of course was a reason to pick out a new restaurant to try. Although Tria has been part of the Philly food and drink scene for a while, I just had not tried it out until this past July. But how I regret not going much, much sooner!We showed up for an early dinner on a Sunday evening and were seated after waiting just a few minutes (no reservations). The space is narrow and long, but didn't feel cramped. We were there with family, but the classy furnishings and (as the night went on) dimmed lighting made it a place where I'd be equally comfortable at happy hour with some girlfriends or on a date night with the Tall Man.Their menu is just one page, with several sharing options as well as salads, sandwiches, and desserts (no entrees). Their drinks menu is extensive on its own, and it took us a few moments to peruse everything. As it was a Sunday, they had additions called \"Sunday School,\" with extended descriptions (\"schooling\") about specials in each category at really affordable prices. Two in our party got the Sunday School wine offering and found it to be delicious, ordering second glasses rather quickly afterward. (The Pipeño 'Aupa,' Viña Maitia '16 from Chile -- see photo.)Every single thing we ordered was excellent. Some of the menu has, by now, changed, but at that time the family got a ravioli appetizer to share, as per the server's recommendation (they were scraping every inch of sauce off with the complimentary bread). The poached figs were just succulent.I initially thought I might have limited options being grain- and dairy-free, since this is a wine bar with lots of cheese and bread. But it was easy to make modifications for my duck salad, which had perfectly cooked duck and great accompaniments so I didn't at all feel like I was missing out. Others got the smoked salmon salad and a couple of the panino, and for a while the table was silent with joyful munching.To top it off, our server was great, extremely attentive with great recommendations. My in-laws are still talking about our meal, now several months later."}, {"review_id": "W3TRMeTAI4rWeSfnxzPOiw", "user_id": "vU9_lZqJQIR8btUYw7fqxA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/11/2017", "text": "When in Center City with a friend, I needed a bite to eat so I decided to stop off at Tria Cafe. I remember in the past this location used to be an Alaska Ice Cream, known for it's good luck tree and moose on the side of the building. Now, it is this cute little place. I was told to sit anywhere in the restaurant, so I sat down at a raised, round table. A few minutes later, our waitress came out. She was very good and pretty personable. However, I did find it a bit odd how there were so many waitresses who would come by and drop off food or refill your drinks. To eat, I got the chilled calamari as well as their chicken sandwich with Lancaster cheddar cheese. I wish they provided bread, but unfortunately they did not. The calamari came out fresh topped with tomatoes, white beans and arugula. The tomatoes and arugula tasted nice and fresh, but I didn't love the white beans. Soon after that, my sandwich came out. I didn't really love how the sandwich was smothered in some sort of mayo. As a result I didn't really love the sandwich. The chicken was pretty good and went nicely with the grilled peppers. While they did have a few desserts including a gluten free chocolate cake, the entire dessert menu was pretty limited. I didn't get anything. Before leaving, the entire staff was very nice and wished me goodbye. Altogether, this is a nice, little restaurant located on Rittenhouse Square."}, {"review_id": "xf_ntFfYVh8D-KiiJJ5pTw", "user_id": "3G9zwCpr-pxQhO2D8-wvxQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I like this Tria for drinks, but not for appetizers.

We went for brunch on Saturday. My friends ordered sandwiches (Panini Fiorentino --$13 each) I ordered Eggs in Purgatory ($12). I loved the chives and prosciutto bits. I wish the dish were a lil spicier. It said it had Calabrian chili oil tho. The bread that came with it was ok. I wonder if it's made in house? My friends only ate half their sandwiches.

I still like the sweet, not-so-dry white wines that are loaded with sugar. Yes, yes, I know - you can totally judge me! BUT let me tell you, Tria has something for everyone. You come in and you're seated on a first come, first serve basis by friendly and courteous staff that are trained to be ninjas in scouting out almost available tables. Although Tria was packed, every.single.server. we encountered was patient and no one seemed rushed. We couldn't decide between wines and our waitress kindly brought out some to sample... I obviously loved the Riesling.By now you know that this girl probably can't be trusted when it comes to judging wine... so why should I read her review? Because this girl loves to eat. And let me tell you, the food here was A-MAZE-ING - just salivating thinking about it. Each bite (of legitimately everything we ordered- see photos) had my eyes rolling to the back of my head.Cheese - The Brie was creamy, spreadable, and delicate; whereas the gouda was dense and bold- perfect combination. It came with a beet sauce, which tasted fresh and delicious, but the cheese was so flavorful I sort of neglected the sauce.Bruschetta - Must orders!! The Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey... I literally licked every drop of honey off my plate. Then, there's the Apple Tree Goat Cheese with Basil Pesto... I totally judged this upon first look - I thought the amount of pesto would overpower the goat cheese, but boy, was I wrong... The ratio was perfect! I was strategically planning my bites to savor it as long as I could. It was one of those, \"it-has-to-be-the-last-bite-because-it's-so-perfect\" kinds of foods.Also, you cannot go wrong with the $2.5 Olive Oil Rosemary Potato Chips. Considering most $1 potato chips bags are filled with air and bland potato chips... you're certainly getting a bang for your buck with these zesty, highly flavorful chips with deliciously creamy aioli.Philadelphia has endless amounts of delectable restaurants, and it's often hard to choose where to go, but Tria definitely needs to be on everyone's Philadelphia restaurant bucket list! It's a must go (at least once.) I've been to this location twice, and it has been fantastic both times.

Haven't had a bad one yet.4. While they have a lot of delicious wines, they don't slack on the beer list which I appreciate. 5.
