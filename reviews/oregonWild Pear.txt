We had our Thanksgiving meal catered and it exceeded my expectations! The turkey was perfect - moist, tender, flavorful, and artfully presented. The sides were equally delicious: the stuffing was rich but balanced with sausage, mushrooms, and celery; the au gratin broccoli and cauliflower was like mac & cheese but better; the cranberry sauce was perfectly sweet-tart with a zing of orange zest. My only suggestion for improvement would be to package the food in oven-ready foil pans. But the quality of the food more than made up for the hassle of transferring it into different dishes for reheating.Bottom line: if you are looking for a catered holiday meal, these guys do it right!"}, {"review_id": "0tPjKUbHAHEbFA79GRPDdg", "user_id": "pZDXUSsYqWjJq5k3_ovEjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Love this place! The staff is pleasant and quick. I love that they have a bar where you can sit if you're having lunch alone. I was seated quickly. I ordered the Pho without noodles but with broccoli. I also had there iced tea which isn't sweetened and is fruity. I highly recommend this tea on a warm day! The Pho is huge. You def get your monies worth when you order this one. The beef was delicious and all ingredients were very fresh making the broth incredibly filling and delicious. Service was attentive and I left full n happy. Easily made it in and out within my lunch hour.

We got there about half an hour before they closed (that always makes me feel terrible), but were met with smiling faces anyway. After being seated, we ordered drinks. I, of course, got my Manhattan. It was almost a little watery and my mom said her Cosmopolitan was the same. It wasn't undrinkable, but I've definitely made better at my house. The pinnacle of the experience for me was their coconut curry soup. I could drink it by the gallon. I wish I knew their recipe. Our server was delightful and friendly the entire time. Aside from the drinks and my parents telling me their pizza tasted frozen, I had a good time."}, {"review_id": "aSIrJcO9H75zGkD7geGGLw", "user_id": "phGXPWbpj4sb-00wcDN_9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Specialized menu that is geared towards light lunch atmosphere.

Full of flavor and seasonal options make it always fun to try something new. The lobster melt on the happy hour menu for fall was phenomenal and went fantastic with the sweet potato fries. The aioli the fries come with was good but the trouble oil is what makes the flavor for the fries. The pear cider available by anthem is fantastic like a Riesling almost but not too sweet or too dry. Happy hour is 3:30-5:30 and is perfect for sampling the potential of the full menu.They have gluten free options but it is a shared fryer."}, {"review_id": "fYkoNFn1GPoXZgYBRdVWPg", "user_id": "gLwb9uTtmoeJrGwE7993GQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/4/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I love Wild Pear.  If you don't want to spend a bunch of time pouring through Yelp trying to find a great place in Salem you won't be disappointed in this place. I haven't had a bad meal here. The cocktails are good too. My favorites lunch is the quiche and soup combo. Seriously their quiche is amazing, so silky and the crust is so buttery in a good way. My husband loves their pulled pork sandwich. The butternut squash soup is delicious. Just go and try it for yourself."}, {"review_id": "ZgbRYVr73jk1RmvA6B6nzQ", "user_id": "IgdX0KbWoRe3fZ-723wqCQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Outstanding food.
