Perfect for studying, business meet ups, reading, or simply to sip on freshly brews of coffee and tea. I've visited three times already... maybe four but the very first didn't count as I was yet a Yelper... or maybe it did. LOL! I love the atmosphere of the café and didn't notice their factory or the room where they grind the beans was visible to guest. LOL! (Didn't capture any photos of that... next time.)I love the fact that they create their own flavors to add to their coffees and teas. With vanilla being my favorite - I normally add it to my cold brew or chai tea latte which is my favorite served hot. I haven't tried any of their small bites (breakfast sandwiches ) but, will definitely give them a try during my next visit."}, {"review_id": "Ijy7PvZG2_2NTJFvlu4inw", "user_id": "QK1Chcnt3pgQYJ8H9HNZSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I come here often with my friends to hangout. Parking is usually a little tough to find, but after a few circles I manage to find a spot.I get the iced latte all the time! I enjoyed my first visit so much, I bought one of their t-shirts. Their coffee is mind blowing. I'm a livid coffee fan (I'm talking about from my Mr. Coffee pot, k-cups, Starbucks, or even dunkin) but the coffee they have here is just out of this world. After I had a sip, I realize what I have been missing out on! The taste is just unique, and I can REALLY taste it. The staff also took time to answer my questions about everything and explained to me the different ways to bring out the unique flavor from every bean. They also showed me the different variety of beans they offer!After the visit I have a new passion for coffee."}, {"review_id": "VxFvRxYKGc2HurWoOryh4g", "user_id": "Jui_st7hFSIaJDBeamXXaA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Bold Bean could be described as the most successful coffee shop here in Jax. The main reason to that is because they do their coffee the proper way. The place has a really nice vibe, a little on the hipster side but it's appropriate and not pretentious -- because this is who they are. I would say that it could be a coffee shop owner's dream to have a place like this. Their customer service is also good, though they're also pretty neutral. What I mean by that is they treat you right but you couldn't expect them to bend backwards for you -- and this is sometimes misunderstood because of the \"starbucks experience\" that most of us are used to where you can basically complain and get freebies.A coffee enthusiast would really appreciate the process that takes place with them making your coffee. The baristas definitely take pride in their work. So let's talk coffee.If you like espresso, this place could almost justify paying almost $4 for it, though, for me it will always be a treat. But that's just me. I would say that if I want to have some good espresso that you'll enjoy in every sip, this is your joint.Their regular drip coffee is also very good. So if you're a simple guy who just want to have coffee and go, this is for you. You'd never really have to order pour over. Unless you really need to..They also roast their own coffee and I always try to get some from time to time and they're always very good and fresh.Overall, I am quite grateful that we have Bold Bean. They've definitely set the bar for coffee shops in the area.  So if you want really good coffee, go to Bold Bean."}, {"review_id": "4-Pz0mWsvDooLi55zHN_Bw", "user_id": "ujZRoCwjEmTH51QCT4NMSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Bold Bean is a go-to favorite of mine. It's local, modern, and affordable. They serve coffee, pastries, beer, and wine. What more could I ask for? I've come here many times for various reasons, whether it be studying or attending a book club meeting or meeting a friend for coffee.I usually ask the barista for a recommendation, whether it be food or drink, and they typically pick something I end up enjoying. They have many vegan alternatives as well, including a vegan brownie that looked divine. Although Bold Bean can give off the pretentious coffee snob vibe, I've never experienced it. The service has always been positive."}, {"review_id": "s639KKpGQQsxNuY2xL_DJQ", "user_id": "I2XEhv9zBeAJcwYIrnMf1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "Hip. Comfortable. Versatile. Coffee. So much coffee.I'm sitting here scrolling through businesses I haven't reviewed and I nearly fell out of my chair when the OG Bold Bean appeared on my list. It's one of my regular stops for good reason. Without hesitation, the community culture of Bold Bean brings a smile to my face.The coffee is the dopest dope I've ever smoked. The vibe hovers on the edge of Austin, TX hipster lifestyle. Yeah, I often feel like I'm not cool enough to hang with these crazy kids. The beers on tap are always rotating, and always spot on.It's much more than a Riverside staple, the brand itself and the philosophy behind puts Jacksonville on the map.

The coffee and tea is usually pretty good. For me the aesthetic in BB is a bit off. It feels a little too industrial and by its nature gives off a cold vibe. While that's probably cool for a lot of people I'm more of a \"warm\" kinda gal. The people are always kind but it's just to cool for me because I'm just a Basic B I will say the mural in the restroom is ON POINT. The decoration is very subtle and it's not a place I'd want to spend time working remotely in but there are a TON of people (mostly men) who do.

Much more hipster and the customers inside were much more the creative types - the other one seemed more young professionals.It's cool they can have two locations with two totally diff vibes. If I lived here I'd deff be going to both. Here when I want to brainstorm and get creative and the other one when I want to hunker-down and and get administrative stuff done (yawn).Great service - the young lady that took care of me was great. She walked me through the menu, offered recommendations on bags of coffee and on a snack. Had a coffee croissant and an iced latte. The latte was delicious and the croissant filled me up will lunch.Well done.My one gripe is that it was packed and there was no where to sit. So come early if you're a laptop crusader looking to get work done. Took a seat outside to wait for a friend.

I love the atmosphere at each location. They are all unique to the local neighborhoods. I also love that Bold Bean is truly a local business and they roast their own beans. Their espresso is the sweetest and smoothest I've tasted. Their syrups are also homemade which is amazing to taste but also for our health since they aren't full of those unnecessary chemicals. I've been regularly frequenting Bold Bean for about 4 years because it's that good. My only recent complaint is that there's an issue with consistency.

I love a coffee shop with a variety of seating options. There are small groups hanging out, others chilling at the counter, hiding behind laptops, or enjoying the weather outside. I also love the feel of this location with its brick walls, cozy furniture, and large chalkboard menu wall.ENJOYING THE COFFEEThe Mocha Cappuccino delivered a nice, creamy drink while a Macchiatto was sweetened with just a dash of foam. Both were not the best we've had, but it was still up there. Their Cold Brew and Iced Coffee also delivered great flavors without getting very bitter. OTHER OPTIONSBesides the free wifi? Although we never got to try it, there's also tea, hot chocolate, little pastries, beer and wine available. Their menu also promoted homemade syrups which I think helps with the great flavors of their drinks. This was a great coffee-centered shop, and I'll definitely return."}, {"review_id": "YAwDWv0RSO6CUwIb9Q9Lbw", "user_id": "65yB0ydGXOZ_-T6J_GbKfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2016", "text": "Maybe it's just me but I find Jacksonvillians somewhat generous with their Yelp ratings.  It's not to say they aren't all giving away 4 or 5 star reviews or less discerning... by no means am I saying that.  For me it's a little different.  In one of my previous JAX reviews I was actually messaged on how a 3* review was perceived as negative and I'm like... Umm for me that's average not bad necessarily... not that I needed to necessarily explain myself.I've been to many places on this continent so I've had the opportunity to compare say a cuisine on one coast to another on the opposite coast.  Diversity, sure but personal preference, taste and the fact that everybody has their own rating system and way of smithing their words together makes for a difference in opinions at times.That being said it's not that always or rarely I will necessarily go with the flow.  To me, there is no flow I follow.  I rate experiences on their own merits based on what I personally experience.  I mean if I see a 4.5 star place odds are it is well earned based on the aggregate scoring and opinions of many... that's just math.  I would still form my own \"stand-alone\" opinion anyway.My wife is the coffee lover amongst the both of us.  That being said it's safe to say we've been to our fair share of coffee houses all over the place.  It doesn't matter what city or time of day... if there's coffee to be had, she'll have one.  I don't always opt to get a coffee based beverage myself as I like cold drinks as well but once in a while I will indulge and go with an espresso based drink like a latte.I will have a latte maybe once or twice a week instead of several times a day.  Still, I can say I know a good latte and this is definitely it.  Bold Bean is without a doubt the best latte I have had to date.  I could go on and on and give a variety of reasons or variables as to what could make it so but I'm not going to really elaborate except to say the coffee was rich and the milk was done perfectly.  My cousin was telling me that they roast the beans in house yadda yadda yadda that's not really a new thing or something unique but regardless of however they process their beans the end result was the best damn latte I can say I've ever had.  From somebody like me that's a pretty BOLD statement considering practically how ubiquitous coffee houses in big cities are and how each one has their own \"way\" of doing things.To put it into perspective this is my first 5* for a coffee.  Bold Bean lives up to their name and to me this place is more than deservant of all the 5* reviews they get.  It's not just southern polite JAX factor.  This is an \"any given big city\" 5* kind of place."}, {"review_id": "wU597CutE5PtUwnl04-8FQ", "user_id": "2qkifar4nTC4TUnegLpoTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Always love the drinks here!  Price wise maybe a little higher than Starbucks, BUT when you consider they do their own roasting, and the creative drinks and flavor syrups, and the show of what it takes to make a good coffee drink, and fantastic presentation, it's sooo more than worth it!  I got a spicy chocolate and honey latte to go.  OMG!    So yummy!"}, {"review_id": "fEWdr-1XcCexgOijPUKcAg", "user_id": "yGPRY6_vbdWh6ttQXYPCHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2017", "text": "This place was pretty cool.
