We read a bunch of Yelp reviews about the awesome food, saw it was only a 13 minute walk from our hotel, and decided to check it out.Unfortunately, the reviews do not mention the location of the restaurant is not in a great area. As out of towners, we had no idea about the area of Bayside and did not feel safe during our trek over to the restaurant. We even witnessed a serious crime on the walk back after breakfast (I know, I can't believe it either.) I wanted to post this to let other out of towners know it is better to drive over to the restaurant instead of walking from the Old Port area. Unfortunately the area of Bayside is currently dealing with a large homeless and drug problem, which was very noticeable once we were in the area. Sketchy neighborhood aside - the food was amazing and the service was excellent. The crab cake benedict was one of the most delicious breakfast items I've ever had. In no way do I want this review to reflect negatively on the restaurant. I just would like to keep other visitors new to the area safe."}, {"review_id": "f-lztHMkabtVRcaBuYvcuw", "user_id": "cI4g3XeHn8zNdVv0srurqA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Tried to go here one time a while back but the wait was 1hr+ ... I can't wait that long for my brunch! So finally when we came here the last time they estimated us at a 45 minute wait - for me is that a long time? Yes... but I'm also usually very hungry come brunch so take it as you want... There's not many seats to sit in while waiting so you're all squished into the downstairs like sardines, there are also I think 4 tables down there which I think would be awkward to sit there because while you're eating there's literally probably 15+ people waiting around your table. Sit upstairs if you have the choice... while you wait there's self service coffee and water.The staff was very friendly and once we were seated the food came out rather quickly.

You can count on one hand where you can get a delicious benedict and an adult beverage on a Wednesday at 10am, and that to me is seriously disappointing and frustrating for a city that's constantly making \"Best Of...\" lists. The point if that rant is: thank you, Bayside American Cafe, for being one of those awesome places serving up elevated breakfast foods midday, midweek. Thanks for having plenty of space in your restaurant so that the wait is never more than 20 or 30 minutes (and even then, you often overestimate the wait time which delightfully surprises us when our name's are called far earlier than we thought it would be!). Thanks for having a coffee-while-you-wait station. That's all awesome stuff!That being said...- The FoodI think there are some really creative looking menu items, but the execution is never quite what I'm expecting. Everything I've ordered just comes out underwhelming in presentation and preparation. Big plates with small under-seasoned portions. The breakfast cocktails are also a bit of a let down: the bloody mary's aren't vegetarian friendly (they contain anchovy), and the other drinks are cloyingly sweet. My perfect brunch is plentiful and flavorful, and Bayside American Cafe just isn't that for me personally. HOWEVER, it's important to note that the best pancake in the entire world is found here. So, whatever you do, no matter how full you are, order a Cinnamon Roll Pancake!!!- The ServiceThe servers here are SO friendly and SO accommodating to dietary needs, but I often feel forgotten about. It's weird to me to have to ask another server if my server is still available because I never received a menu, or the drinks I ordered, my food never showed up but my bill did, etc. Waters and coffees are never refilled, we're never checked on, etc. And this has happened every time I've come. I know being a server isn't an easy job, I know that it's never not busy at this restaurant, but... it's frustrating when other similar establishments in town make customer service look, seem, and feel effortless. I know I'm in the minority on this one, and that's okay. You'll probably love it here! As for me, I'm a devoted brunch enthusiast of another place in town, and I think I'll just stick to going there!"}, {"review_id": "YDfSAFNnTccBCmRqJrhomA", "user_id": "PZQW-uzIFOv3rnpil1NQuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "This place was so good, that my fiancé and I decided to get brunch here 2 days in a row during our recent visit to Portland. There is a wait because the place is extremely small (and quaint/adorable) but it's WELL worth the wait. The guy who runs it is not only efficient and organized, but insanely personable and friendly. In fact, all of the staff members we interacted with were extremely friendly- our waiter, our waitress, and another waitress downstairs made us special drinks during our wait!I got the Tuscan scramble my first time there, and my fiancé got the Louisiana Benedict. The second visit I got a basic breakfast with 2 eggs, sausage, homefries, and honey wheat toast, my fiancé got the huevos rancheros, and we split a cinnamon bun pancake. He said he's never had huevos rancheros that delicious. The cinnamon bun pancake was to die for. The homefries are made of 3 potatoes. And are amazing. All of the food was scrumptious and tasted so fresh. We got mimosas, chai lattes, and the rocket fuel coffee with Bailey's and even the drinks were well done!"}, {"review_id": "Oxj1hjepQFp7ChnlTZZmTA", "user_id": "TMmby2veeIJ1VS1wiViIVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Very very tasty.

Well I have my new favorite breakfast spot in Portland! Came in with a somewhat large group (7 people) and were able to hang out around the serve-yourself coffee bar while we waited for our seats. While we were waiting we got to watch the kitchen staff cook while sipping on freshly brewed brew! When we were seated our waitress quickly came by and brought us fresh coffee and water. She was very helpful in menu recommendations and was available if we needed anything. I got the blueberry pancake (with real maple syrup) and a side of bacon (ordered crispy). Yum yum yummy yum. The waitress said one pancake would be enough and she was right! I was STUFFED after that one pancake and the bacon. The pancake was a little crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I loved it - but my stepmom wasn't a fan of the crisp on the outside for her pancake. In her opinion it made it too difficult to cut. A couple people got the Cajun burger and they both loved it - they both said it was quite spicy tho, so be prepared! Excellent feedback on the bennies! The eggs were PERFECTLY poached. They were even perfectly round. They must have some special poaching tool that makes the eggs that beautiful. I wish I had something to complain to make this review more balanced but I don't. Five stars.

After reading yelp reviews I knew that the earlier we got here the better. We ended up arriving around 9:45 on a Sunday morning and were told that there was about a 30-45 min wait. The inside of the restaurant is very small and and gets full very quickly. There was pretty much no where stand so we waited outside. It was cold out so I appreciated that they had coffee available while you waited. Our total wait time ended up being closer to 1 hour. Once we were seated upstairs our server was friendly but could have been more attentive, it seems like we went long periods of time without seeing her. I had the salmon benedict and my husband had the strawberry french toast. Both were delicious. After seeing the cinnamon bun pancake we also had to order one of those as well. That was one of the best things I have ever tasted. That pancake is available in stack of 1, 2, or 3. The pancake is huge and rich so 1 is definitely plenty but it tastes so good that I can easily see how someone could easily go through 2 or 3.The next time I am in Portland, I will be back here for sure and I will make sure that I get there earlier next time!"}, {"review_id": "ZPtLOsbimWEjqAvqRxR4HA", "user_id": "pB5cmzz37uqCDfQJaZUywQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "Came at a good time in the morning to experience this cozy breakfast joint!

Lots to choose from on the menu, and I settled on the fritatta with lobster. It was really delicious. I stayed a while, since my next appointment was about 45 minutes after I sat down, and was told I could stay as long as I needed to, even after people started filling in the seats.

My husband had come here several months ago and had a wonderful experience. Finally, the other weekend, we were able to stop by for some breakfast so that I could give it a try!We had called 15 minutes prior to arriving to inquire about a wait at which time there was none. However, by time we walked in, we were told it would be a 30 - 40 minutes prior to being seated. Being Portland on a Saturday morning, we were willing to wait.The entrance is very tight and there is not much room for people to stand and wait. It is definitely a struggle here as this is a popular breakfast location and it gets over crowded very quickly.It was also odd as there were many open seats available, but the host was not seating anyone. He indicated that he did not want to seat everyone all at one time as this would cause delay with the servers and cooks, therefore he was trying to stagger the seating..... which seems understandable. However, there were many other customers who did not seem pleased by this and led to some awkward confrontation..... but good entertainment me me!We were finally seated upstairs in the primary dining area at a nice booth in the back across from the bar. We were quickly greeted by a server and able to place some drink orders.We got a round of the bloody mary's and they were quite tasty. There was nothing spectacular about them, but they definitely satisfied the craving.The menu provided a great selection. You had your traditional breakfast options, some omelets, and some benedicts.I went with the Bayou Benedict which was served on a corncake with some Cajun hollandaise..... soooooo delicious! I also got a side of the hash which was spectacular.The service was consistent and we were appropriately attended to.

They encourage you to order sides to go with it.  I needed no encouragement.  I felt so lousy from the night before that I had scribbled my last will and testament on the napkin.  It's not often you find yourself praying for a fatal case of food poisoning.Unfortunately, when I bit into the food, I was disappointed.It was very fresh and structurally perfect: The meat had a char, the interior was perfectly cooked, my eggs over easy were runny and firm in the right areas, and the toast and home fries were cooked right as well.  But something about the flavor of every item was off.  The maple sausages were too sweet.  Yeah, they're maple, but I'd tone down the sweetness a little and replace it with salt.  Salt and sweet go very well together in both savory dishes and dessert.  But they're like the House and the Senate: One should never overpower the other.The herby flavor on the outside of the steak tasted burned and pungent.  The meat itself was delicious and medium-rare but the pungent flavor on the outside was unappetizing.  I couldn't finish it.  The home fries had no real flavor and the toast was caramelized on one side but not the other.  I would replace that thick slab of bread with a thinner slice, preferably regular white bread, and I'd stick to bright, fresh flavors for the home fries, perhaps some lemon juice.The egg was the only thing I had no problem with.  But that's a little hard to screw up.  Nevertheless, I'm giving them points for it because I liked the restaurant itself and the people who worked there.That was the only thing that stopped me from giving this place two stars.  I've met friendly staff before but there was a warmth and camaraderie here that transcended mere friendliness.  The employees of Bayside have the vibe of a person you would call for bail money.  They had the vibe of someone you know will still love you despite seeing you led out in handcuffs.That attitude was exactly what I needed to chase away fantasies of sticking my vodka-soaked head in the deep fryer to end my pain.  And that attitude is what earns them at least 3.5 stars.  The food is an easy fix and I know they can cross the finish line with a few tweaks."}, {"review_id": "iXbrfdMXgPfhyiDLiwTuow", "user_id": "Zk0-wvM40P8F7tSah2v61w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/4/2017", "text": "I was super bummed they didn't have any lobster or crab available (they claimed to have had a busy weekend) but their alternatives definitely made up for it!
