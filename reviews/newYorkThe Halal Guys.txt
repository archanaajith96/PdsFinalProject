The flavors were very enjoyable because it was seasoned well and had a little spiciness. I added both packets of dressing they provided which was good on its own and great when mixed with the rest of the dish. However, the chicken and beef were cooked inconsistently and some pieces were dry while others we not. The pita was not soft and seemed like it was bought at the corner bodega. As a result, I wouldn't recommend the wrap.Value - very good, $8 and there was enough for two mealsService - I got lucky and there was no line so it was ready by the time I finished paying.Atmosphere - N/A, it's a food cartFacility - N/A, it's a food cartNeed to know - meat is a little spicyWould I come back - YesWould I go out of my way - Maybe***Rating justification - For a restaurant, this place is serving average food at below average prices. However, it's not a restaurant, it's a food cart and they are doing a pretty good job considering. As a brick and mortar restaurant this place would probably get three stars."}, {"review_id": "6Z1V28yoMaXEJWFLcBwVSQ", "user_id": "UCpnsaHoIjJsa7VVT9wx7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "OG halal, wonderful.

I promptly avoided it for years. However, as I work nearby, my curiosity got the better of me and I returned to try it on a warm spring day.Around noon on a weekday, the line was virtually nonexistent, which surprised me. There was still a bit of a wait as they were switching over their meats. Chicken and rice is $8, which is a decent premium to other carts, but I challenge you to finish this in one sitting.Once I was back at my desk, I was pleasantly surprised that it was still warm. Unfortunately, the chicken was absurdly dry. Their famous white sauce failed to perk it up-- I don't understand why all the raves when it tasted like nothing to me. The red sauce is nothing to mess around with, but it makes it tough to make a consistently mildly spiced experience. The rice was decent, as were the pita and lettuce.I don't know... it lasted me two meals, which I appreciate, but I was never happy to be eating it. I don't mean to be a Halal Hater, but I really don't get the hype here."}, {"review_id": "QH3APV81lIeCO5tYw-Wwlw", "user_id": "O3q-nwYZykMmacxjru01Zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "You line up for the food truck, you order, add toppings, and eat at the side of the street. A quick meal can't get better than that in the core of one of the busiest cities in the world. Line can get very long - it was about 8pm at night and the wait almost 10 minutes. They have only a few basic options (3 or 4?), and that's all you get to choose from. There's no fancy terms or cool toppings, you get what you get. The portion is generous, and I'd be impressed if you finish the entire thing. Loads of meat, and really like how they didn't go easy with the sauces!

But over the years, the quality have dwindled down. Once they have franchised, the food just doesn't taste the same anymore.It is still one of the best chicken over rice but it was definitely better years ago. I am really disappointed that the white sauce is now in packets. It doesn't taste as fresh as it used to be when they were in bottles. I love a bunch of white sauce over my rice and now they charge for additional packets.I don't come as often anymore but always do when I have out of town guests.

I'd say the difference between this one and the one in SF is this one the lamb and chicken is thinly shredded while the one in SF has more bite sized pieces. The sauces are pretty similar, nothing noticeable unless if you're tasting them side by side. This one is also cheaper, here it's $8 while $10 SF. That $2 difference for a solid meal is worth that 5th star.  Bang for the buck can be found here."}, {"review_id": "lNURCuNyv2UdtLUgw1SKCg", "user_id": "YjJNgb2nJ1AcTvjnJpQehw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Super yummy, quick, and affordable food.

I always try to get a platter anytime I'm in The city, even if it's out of my way. The flavors are unlike anything I've tasted before. Take a bite and find your tongue dancing a thousand different ways. The line might seem intimidating with upwards of 40 people waiting at a time but it is so worth it. I recommend the beef gyro with 1 strip of red (spicy) sauce and 2.5 strips of white (mild/yogurt) sauce for newbies, or 2 strips of red sauce and 3 stripes of white for more experienced chicken and rice eaters. Be careful trying to find this place, they're the cart that's right next to Starbucks. There's about 5 or 6 other chicken and rice carts around the area claiming they're the famous ones you want to try but NO! You'll know you've reached the right cart when you see the long but quick moving line and guys wearing their characteristic yellow shirts with red lettering. Will definitely go again! So so so good. None of the stand alone stores they've popped up in different cities around the country compare to this location which is crazy because it's a cart. Guys are fairly nice, don't dawdle too long trying to pick something, they're patient but the line builds quickly so they like to keep things moving. Don't know if things have changed but bring cash!

We went with the combo platter with extra rice, no lettuce and a beef gyro. While you're waiting, the aroma of grilled meats fills the air and within minutes, a big plate (or handheld) of food is given to you. Make sure to ask for their famous white sauce and go easy on the hot sauce - it'll make your mouth numb without notice.Since it's a street vendor, there's no seating. Luckily there's some benches nearby, but they get crowded really fast. Depending on how full you make your plate, you'll have to figure out how to eat it while standing and not spilling any precious ingredients on the ground. It's a cheap, quick meal that will keep you full for most of the day.
