Pretty dang good burgers!My sister and I ordered 2 cheese burgers , 1 order of chili cheese fries, 1 order of regular fries and 2 cokes ($25 without tip). Their burger was so delicious, you can taste how fresh and good quality their meat is. Their veggies like tomatoes and lettuce in the burger were also fresh. Their regular fries were perfect and crunchy. We didn't like their chili cheese fries that much but eh. The service was good, we both highly recommend this place the next time you're craving a big burger with fries."}, {"review_id": "Pflxi7UKbeaMCo_2YrWaXQ", "user_id": "bqZ4gpGRgZHRfaqII1w04g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "First time coming in here was last week and to my surprise, I was by myself when I showed up but that quickly changed as a rush of people came in. As far as the food goes, it was decent. Good hamburger. Good Fries. It has that nice little diner feel to it which is always good. The people there were super friendly. The price of the food seemed a bit high though for the reasons I am about to say. If I was going to tell ownership or management anything it's that this place needs an update. Bad. The guy who took my order added up my total with a calculator. I am a trusting guy but I can see lots of people having an issue. It also took them 20 minutes to get through orders for 6 people. Getting an Ipad in there with a card swiper would eliminate all that. Also, this place needs a cleaning badly. It's not counter tops or floors, but the hard to reach places are kind of gross and something like just replacing the ceiling panels would make this place way nicer cause they are disgusting.I love having a nice diner feel with freshly cooked food, but the space feels like it is on it's last leg and some updates are needed badly."}, {"review_id": "fand5RBs7DkqOjVJ2EtaWw", "user_id": "R331t68FPezqSA5ts-c8CQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "No frills. Really tasty. Scratches that Diner experience itch. 4+ Stars for on-target Diner expectations. Would have gone 5 Stars, but the lady at the grill kind of emanated attitude and a general displeasure with being there. The lady who took our order, however, was wonderful. So, just slight room for improvement on the customer service side.Sunday 8:30 am... Darcie and I went for breakfast. I was shamefully and irresponsibly hungry. I got an order of Biscuits and Gravy, Hash Browns, and a Bacon Cheeseburger. I know, yikes. But it sure hit the spot. Both spots! The Breakfast spot and and the non-Breakfast spot. I felt a bit less guilty when Darcie got the BCB as well. Prices are reasonable, the tastiness is stratospheric. For the record, half my burger went home with me.As has been mentioned by others. GH is petite. Arriving during peak times will require patience through the wait to be seated. Word to the wise: Sunday mornings before 9:15 are a sweet spot for seating.So stop in and get your fix, soak up some all-biddness Diner atmosphere and Deliciousness.Oh, and dear lordy, I have to try some pie next time. They look amazing. Thanks for being there Giant Hamburgers. Love ya!"}, {"review_id": "tkUBU_YmrQ1F3pXb0yfHDw", "user_id": "nNKxnbcqyys5PY_8ZZy5YA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "I have been going here since the 7th grade and now I'm in my late 20's. I remember seeing the commercial on TV when I was a kid with the trucker saying \"It's the best darn hamburger, I ever had\".  The quality of this place has gone down hill since then. It's needs to be renovated.Paint job. New Countops, New Chairs, New Tables, and definitely needs a deep clean. Floor is dirty, where the food is prepped looks dirty, and ceiling pannels have stains.Another suggestion, mount a TV on the wall so customers who go in to eat alone have some entertainment while waiting or eating their food.The prices your paying for their food isn't well worth the quality of what they serve.Overall, owner needs to update Giant Hamburger and get this placed cleaned up. This place is filthy.

I had a giant sized appetite (Jack and beanstalks were nowhere to be found though) when we walked into this restaurant. It has a diner feel in here, with booths and tables, main counter with grill visible to the customers, and a bit of a faded look to the decor. I definitely wanted something with hamburger in it but also wanted breakfast so I thought that getting a cheeseburger omelet would be perfect. I also added green chile because why not? I also shared some chili cheese fries. The omelet had multiple layers of thin crepe-like egg, folded in a neat rectangular package holding the filling ingredients. It was a bit greasy but hey it's a hamburger place I wasn't expecting a salad. The egg, despite being cooked in very thin layers, was very nicely cooked, having a soft light consistency. The hamburger meat and cheese in contrast, was very dense and heavy. In hindsight I think an extra added hit of texture in the filling (Maybe some chopped onion?) would have broken up some of the similar soft filling ingredients since the green chile also had a similar texture. After a while I had to stop eating the omelet primarily due to the cheese. It had a gummy cloying consistency and overly processed taste that I couldn't handle. I didn't care for the chili cheese fries which were too salty for my tastes, in addition to having the same squares of processed melted cheese on top. I have no doubt that the hamburger patties are fresh and good quality, and I thought it was cool that an all female crew was working here when I went. I do wish that some of the other ingredients matched the quality of the beef though, especially for the price we paid."}, {"review_id": "wHEYc40L8dfvB2i_fTkqaw", "user_id": "y789b-PJ2yeVr9Cq2_g1Yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Wonderful tasting Old Fashioned Cheeseburgers ..Best I've had in many years!!  hot dogs, chili & pie's just  delicious ..

I really wanted to taste the authentic, REAL beef in my burger. Considering I am 20 weeks expecting and my cravings are to be brought to meet it's full expectations, I went on a frenzy in hunting down the best burger joint on Yelp...and BAM, it's here.Space is small, but it was cozy! We had a little trouble finding the location due to the display light being out of service. We almost gave up because we thought the place closed or was closed down. (We drove around the plaza being super suspicious). Like I said, I wanted to taste the authentic beef, which was served fresh, along with the lettuce, tomato.
