The food is spectacular and after the renovation the building is spectacular too!There is ample seating inside and out with both booths and tables. The queue is usually long so go expecting to wait 20 minutes or go early, I go at 11 and wait maybe ten minutes. I literally have never had anything here I didn't like. Seriously not one thing! My favorite sandwich hands down is the turkey martini on pumpernickel. Turkey is piled high then topped with a bunch of mushrooms that add a nice earthy flavor. The garlic herb spread is what puts it over the top and into my top three fav sandwiches ever. My favorite cake is the Hawaiian princess, it hits every note for me!Their catered cakes are wonderful as well, I ordered any wedding cake from here six years ago and it was perfect! The flavors were great and they allowed me to bring in sugar buttons I ordered to be used for decorations on the cake."}, {"review_id": "fZw3iAbnDRpjAyOWkn_gwg", "user_id": "iWg7D9lt9VudpvE0ksw9LQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "おいしい!I love the newly renovated Wright's!The Club sandwich is my favorite!

Have been coming here my whole life. A  small deli offering breakfast, sandwiches, soups, salads and desserts. You place your order at the counter, pay, wait until they call your name and then grab a table. It gets really crowded at lunch. I call my order in. They have a separate line for call in orders so the line moves much faster.  I like their sandwiches, soups and desserts. Not a big fan of the green salads for some reason and I'm a salad gal. Can't put my finger on it. They certainly do sell a lot of them though.

All the cakes are delicious and come in different sizes including cupcakes. We've order them for parties many times.  The service is as efficient as possible even if they have long lines and the staff is friendly.  They have increased their parking lot as well but it is still best to carpool because it's still not enough.

Sure, I live here but no one can make a delicious variety of cupcakes like they do. I was introduced to them about 9 years ago and have been going back for cakes and cupcakes for almost every occasion since. Their frosting is delicious. I like all of their cupcakes/cakes but my favorites are the Alpine, Hummingbird and Carrot. As for the other food they offer---it's all delicious! One of my favorites is the \"Paris\" sandwich. They have their own unique twist/flavors to all all their sandwiches.

I'm a sucker for sweets and have adjusted to their icing, which is rather rich, pumped with lots of sugar and some of the best I've had! One of my dream jobs is to be like Anthony Bourdain and travel across the word in search of local, homemade treats and stuff my face with endless desserts or at least attempt to live like him in Tampa, FL!The Cake Menu features: Chocolate Cake, Alpine Cake, Coconut Cake, Hawaiian Princess Cake, Lemon Cake, Carrot Cake, Hummingbird Cake, Red Velvet Cake, Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake, Peppermint Chocolate, etc.All of their cakes are made in house, from scratch. My absolute favorite, timeless and never get tired of is their three layered Coconut Cake smudged between two layers of coconut icing and topped with coconut flakes. It was absolute perfection in a bite (You know I didnt stop after one bite, had to restrain getting seconds because wasn't sure everyone got to try it and it was so popular, only a little left out of a huge cake sheet!) from the soft, moist cake with added creamy coconut filling and extra tasty with a hot cup of Earl Grey tea. I also really enjoy their Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake because this time around, the chocolate cake wasn't overbaked, which in the past has caused it to dry out and wish the cake was consistently moist!I read other Yelp reviews, stating how ginormous their sandwiches are, would love to stop by one of these days to get a feel for the place and split sandwich with a friend, so I'd have room for a slice of cake!"}, {"review_id": "-fWNj7c0TF0xpg65ECfBEA", "user_id": "-Bx2_dNG4wqMyY5m9I2zQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Wright's is THE place to be for lunch in south Tampa!

Their recent expansions proves that they have been satisfying customers for quite some time now. This location has indoor and out door seating. We usually sit inside since there is a lot more room now. A few years ago your best bet was to count on taking your food to go. My go to sandwich is the Golden gate it is Roast pork, crisp bacon, Jarlsberg cheese, German  dill  pickle  slices,  lettuce, homemade  mustard  sauce,  and peach chutney - on pumpernickel bread. I will typically sub out the roast pork for turkey. You must try the GOLDEN GATE! The peach chutney and the crispy bacon really make this sandwich! The mix of salty crispy bacon and sweet peach chutney will leave you enamored.  This sandwich is big enough for 2 people if you plan on getting a side salad. Their salads are delicious, especially the potato salad. To finish off our meal my honey and I split a slice of the hawaiian princess cake. It is a delicious  coconut  cake  with  a rich  filling  of  coconut  and  pineapple,  covered  with  a  cream  cheese frosting. This was a first for me and it was delicious. Typically we go for the hummingbird cake which I highly recommend!If you are debating on checking this place out, DON'T! Just go and I promise you will not regret it. There is a reason they have been in business so long. They have parking along the front of the building and also an over flow lot right next to the building. I have never had a hard time finding parking."}, {"review_id": "Y_WUS-YnAnA8P1nO-hXMHA", "user_id": "CcOgdfEJxgrxTAwag5k18Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "My mother, wife and I stopped in here on our way to an afternoon at the aquarium.  Place was packed, but the line moved quickly.  You order at an individual station where a sandwich \"artist\" makes whatever you'd like (including sides) and then pay at a register.  Certainly not fancy, but fairly efficient and fun to watch you awesome sandwich get assembled right before your eyes.Be forewarned...the sandwiches are quite large, as are the portion sizes of the sides and desserts.  My wife and I split a beef martini sandwich (their signature concoction) with a side of potato salad and a \"slab\" of red velvet cake.The beef martini sandwich was so simple but a great combination of flavors...the beef was a perfect medium rare  Their potato salad was ultra creamy and full of dill, it was one of the best I've ever had in terms of the bright dill flavor.A slice of their red velvet cake could serve four people, no lie!  The cream frosting had a hint of almond in it making for a unique take on this classic dish.Tons of seating, great food, and a lively deli atmosphere make this a must-stop if you are in this part of town."}, {"review_id": "2R8RtZnCuFekQMcQR7rX2A", "user_id": "uXbM7R_1vEOqmiCsC2k1pg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "This is the place to eat.  WOW!!!

Lol.  But the staff members were super friendly and the line moved pretty quick. They have a section where you can do call-ahead/online orders, and highly recommend doing that if you're in a rush and don't want to wait. Once it's your turn, you go up to the kitchen and tell your order to the staff in the back.  They make your sandwiches for you right in front of you and wait til they're done making it. If you order a hot sandwich, they'll let you know how much longer you'll have to wait.  Once everything is ready, you then go to the register to pay.  Service is pretty fast and lots of seating space.  The bathrooms here are also really clean, multiple restrooms and each stall has a changing station! Winner for families and me!  I ordered the grilled cheese and it was really yummy!  I also had it with the soup of the day which was the Creamy Chicken Soup.  Tasted so home-y and went really good with my sandwich.  My fiance also ordered the Broccoli Salad and Shrimp Pasta Salad. Omg soooo good!  They have so many other choices for sides, so I have to make a trip back just to try them out.  Let's not forget about dessert.  Holy cakes galore.  Lots of flavors, big slices that are pre-cut, and they have cupcakes too!  We tried the Hawaiian Princess and it is AMAZING.  I'm not a big fan of coconut and pineapple, I mean don't get me wrong it's good but not my choice usually of cake flavor but this cake changed my mind.  Just the right amount of coconut and pineapple as the filling with real chunks of pineapple and the cake was super moist and not dense at all.  Very very good place!"}, {"review_id": "-0SoSi-kJOLqLMAuK_tkmA", "user_id": "hJzxtL6BVXaV4_FqWT0bHg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Disappointed on this mornings visit.

Thursday afternoon and they're packed! Located in the corner of a small plaza. I've always wanted to go here since trying their gourmet cakes at my work. (Every Christmas a physician group buys our nursing unit a HUGE gourmet cake, every year its different.) So moist, dense, and so delicately sweet. I really shouldn't ever buy a baked good from this establishment because it's so seriously good it null and voids all self control. Best rum cake and banana bread I've ever had. I can't wait for the holidays to show up with goodies from here! You'll be the star for sure. The outside looks small but inside is quite expansive. I was confused at first by the ordering process. You wait in line and then order directly at the deli counter where you can watch them make your sandwich! They pride themselves in being a business that's been around for 50 years who put who they are in their food and it shows in many ways, this being one of them. We ordered their signature sandwiches the golden gate and the beef martini. The man behind the deli counter was sooooo kind and patient with us and offered many helpful recommendations. I wasn't sure if we placed our side orders for potato salad, and pesto pasta there or at the cashier and he politely stated that whatever we could not find at the counter he would retrieve for us personally. First off. These sandwiches are GINORMOUS. I created two hearty meals out of one sandwich. It's cut into four pieces and one piece is almost the size of a regular sandwich for me! Talk about bang for your buck. The golden gate sandwich was tasty, I thought the peach chutney was too sweet for my liking and I'd prefer the bacon to be piping hot but still a very good sandwich. I actually liked the beef martini a little better. It must have been the wine marinated beef and mushrooms or the buttered herb spread! Lol Those are my kind of flavors. I really liked that they had affordable scoop options of all their pasta and potato salads. We tried the home style and dill potato salads. I liked the dill more, too much of a sweet vinegar taste for my liking in the home style. The pesto pasta salad is made with homemade pesto, strong onion flavor. Star of this whole show was the small wedge of rum cake we finished up with. Perfect. I grabbed a load of banana bread to go for my morning coffee treat!"}, {"review_id": "zHugGMiLkaXroeRBbUPntw", "user_id": "-XAGJZTMlfQlm1f15kIDug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "The BEST sandwiches in all of Tampa Bay!

The Alpine lace is a great cake that's perfect for a classic birthday, but every flavor is insanely delicious in its own way! The chocolate peanut butter slice is rich, but the cake itself isn't as sweet as others. The carrot cake and hummingbird slices are definitely the more indulgent of the slices, chock full of nuts or fruit then slathered with their rich cream cheese frosting... I'm salivating just thinking about their cakes!But besides cake, they also make killer sandwiches. The Paris is awesome, but lately I've been getting the Barnyard breakfast sandwich as a wrap. Their deli ham and cheese is something special.Now that they've renovated their building and parking, it's not as scary to try to come and eat inside for lunch without getting stampeded.

The menu is quite overwhelming with a slew of options. However, when I visited for lunch about a week ago the line was pretty long so it gave me some time to go through all the choices.

The sandwich was filled with rare juicy roast beef, tender sautéed mushrooms, perfectly crisp bacon and a creamy garlic and herb spread. The flavors complimented each other perfectly creating one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The cupcake was amazing. The dense and filling yellow cake was topped with sweet and rich chocolate frosting and white chocolate shavings.

The new expansion has its positives and negatives. Gone are the nice outdoor patio seating area and replaced with a few small tables with no shade. However, they have expanded the indoor seating area. The ordering/checkout area is huge now, but feels like a warehouse. For some reason, the line feels much longer because of that. Wright's is known for its pies and cakes so don't forget to place your holiday orders in advance. Their sandwiches are good too.

I've yet to be disappointed. They are top notch, if you haven't tried them. You can just taste the love and dedication in every extravagant bite. However, since their expansion, I've just recently rediscovered this Bay Area, family owned staple in a whole new way. It's the food, people; the food!!! I now see why the parking lot is always jam packed and lines are always nearly out the front door, whenever I've randomly dropped by to pick up a slice of their Hummingbird or Hawaiian Princess cakes, which of their immense offerings, are my two favorites. Now I can officially add their sandwiches to that coveted list. I had the roast pork sandwich on white bread, instead of pumpernickel(which is the recommended choice, btw). I on the other hand, am not a huge fan of pumpernickel, so good old fashioned, fresh baked white bread for me, please. Let's just say my mouth is watering as I write this. That was a friggin' phenomenal sandwich from start to finish. The roast pork was tender, flavorful, and seasoned to perfection. I like that customers are able to watch the preps as they are making them. And that Petes mustard sauce is just the perfect kick to give the sandwich a little bite with every bite. To round out my lunch, I also ordered the minestrone which was nothing short of hearty and delicious. The broccoli and peanut salad is no joke. The sweet creamy Mayo that they use in the recipe is phenomenal. Put's one in the mind of a sweet, tangy coleslaw, but instead of raw cabbage, it's broccoli florets, peanuts and red onions. Definitely a must try!!! And lastly, but certainly, not least my meal wasn't complete without a slice of Wrights'  infamous Hummingbird cake. A savory banana cake that comes chock full of nuts and pineapples and is finished off with a decadent cream cheese.The prices are reasonable for the portions and quality of food. The staff is always courteous and efficient. They keep the lines flowing smoothly. Furthermore, with the recent renovation and expansion, Wright's is definitely more accommodating to its customers who choose to dine in, either indoors or outside on the patio. Very family friendly environment. Also the Perfect place to dine with coworkers or solo dolo, if you've got the time during the workweek. Kudos all around!!! If you hadn't already, I suggest you make the Wright choice, today and treat yourself to Wright's Gourmet House. Your tastebuds will thank you."}, {"review_id": "uUuuH2oHKMQXARCZczNZCg", "user_id": "L5hxAqFS-j1CkxUfJIV1_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/11/2017", "text": "I love this new location!!!
