The service is quick and friend. A fantastic Nampa experience.    I started with a beer and a complimentary bowl of hot chowder. Just what I needed on this cold day. I followed this with pot stickers and the the crispy duck. The stickers were fried and not boiled. They had a great texture. This is the best Thai food in Canyon County."}, {"review_id": "8xy5frU68Qd-LYt3xB_V9w", "user_id": "fLTm9wRlUBEMqg0puABOTQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Some of the best Thai food in the Valley.  Today I had Three Flavor Chicken, which I discovered was their concession to the American palette and too Americanized for me.  The coconut chicken soup was outstanding as usual, and Sherry's green curry was amazing.  The service was friendly as usual."}, {"review_id": "6etL4jtKOf0qzgXoi5oS-Q", "user_id": "Xz0zfaHuNMST1bOtz4m8lQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Authentic fabulous Thai food at reasonable prices. As usual I got the chicken green curry and a cup of Thom kai gah soup,  excellent, so yummy and spicy.   The service is always fast and friendly, is a popular spot so you may have to wait but it is worth it. The salad dressing on the salad is so good. It's worth the drive to Nampa"}, {"review_id": "WoPKaoKpHdoRAO0uDSRROg", "user_id": "1WX0NWAiMQJh_h3wcQbPcw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Very unassuming from the outside but the best Thai food in Boise. Absolutely love the fresh rolls, pineapple fried rice, and sweet and sour chicken.  Ambiance is minimal, but service is incredibly friendly and the food never disappoints. Always worth the wait but go early if you can.  Quiet tables for two available in the back."}, {"review_id": "1EFnuMAKrOy6t4powlTAPA", "user_id": "YQSwlsXDhxegjT_1TSgvsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Everything was great including the presentation until I found a hair in my food. I probably would've given 5 stars -see my pictures! As a former waitress myself I would've without a blink of a eye took the item off that person's bill no matter how polite they were about the issue. I rather not comment too much about the service because it could have been better before I found the hair... but anyways....back to the food: Came in and ordered a few appetizers, a Coconut soup-delicious-and so much better than the menu description! I highly recommend this item-it does have chicken in it. Condensed coffee-pretty tasty! Star Wontons- very good but not a must have item. And the dumplings that I now would rather forget. I'm sure I'll come back sometime-eventually-but really I'm more likely to first look for a different Thai place. This place is usually very busy and also closed Sundays and Mondays, I believe."}, {"review_id": "EQTu8fRDU_ePZeeNL6na9Q", "user_id": "Dg0tdkwHgS0ZqL1XvnWPWg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "very disappointed. this restaurant comes up under vietnamese, so while it's listed as thai, the photo looks like pho. don't think you can order vietnamese even though its listed under that category."}, {"review_id": "cDSLBenCbfCjrMEvCM-k1Q", "user_id": "6iijXV8oSxJyjzKuGIhmgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Food is fantastic and the service is unbeatable.  We ordered the drunken noodles, the spicy crispy duck, chef's special, and mango rice and coconut ice cream for dessert.

Take out is super slow and plan on doubling the estimated wait time. I assume this is because in store customers get preference. Quoted 30 minutes the last two times and it took an hour each time.

The food is amazing and second to none in Nampa."}, {"review_id": "mNbe5gR4P1GoUsZxqT8CQw", "user_id": "8EjEyJhDIsohTNWZCwp9pA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Unassuming strip mall location, but food was very good.

For example, last weekend, I ordered takeout on Saturday at 5 PM. I know this is a busy time and was not surprised when I was told it would be an hour wait. However when 6 pm rolled around, my food was not ready. At 6:30 my food was still not ready. This happens often.

We had a feast, enjoyed some plum wine, a duck roll, some pad Thai and also some pineapple curry. The duck rolls were delicious, like a salad roll with crispy duck inside. The pad Thai was average, but the pineapple curry was amazing. It was cooked with shrimp and muscles. All around, very tasty and affordable meal, and we had leftovers!"}, {"review_id": "EUnOHXSanBRM2ZAdmpIopQ", "user_id": "WIB-6x2zZXa3vgR-tyTvhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My hubby and I order to go here for dinner every couple months.
