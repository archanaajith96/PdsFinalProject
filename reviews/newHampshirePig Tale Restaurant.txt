The only downside is it's a bit pricey but I guess you get what you pay for... because it's pretty amazing. I love the mushroom pesto pizza. It's definitely my favorite on their menu but I haven't been disappointed at all by anything I've tried there. I ordered a BLT once. Omg... seriously the best one I've ever had in my life. The tomatoes were super juicy, sweet, and fresh tasting. Loved it!!"}, {"review_id": "pWodVCd3ZEk6wS4UpTNJOg", "user_id": "MTpldB5imN-peVtNFY5YCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "I kept wanting to go back (while on business travel) so I  could try everything.  Wish that I could have tried the spaghetti dish and the chicken!A month later,  I ate the chicken!

Which was very good mind you ..adequately different and a decent size for $20.00 and another dish with eggplant...that was not what we ordered.  Apparently once we were able to summon him back...he had misheard our order and thought we ordered Gratin instead of Poutine...OK...so he scurried off to put in the correct order and assured us that would be taken off our bill ( the wrong item)....The combination of this realization..( no really?  You not going to charge me for something I didn't order?)...being grabbed in my seat another time...and some woman. when my husband finally stood up from his seat because he had had enough of people bumping into him and putting  drinks on our dining table looking him in the eye and saying oh tee hee...I'm not your server...It was enough.   We had hurriedly finished the pizza and had given up on the correct order  coming and tried to signal for the  bill.   Long story short at least a little shorter, is the manager apologized the server said that maybe he could  have done better controlling the traffic around our table...No joke there were 20 people mashed around our table and countless other behind me...which at least didn't bother me...heck they were blocking the cold rush of air that I was hit with every time the  door opened.   Seriously if there had been an emergency...there was no getting out of there...Our server in the  whole space of our irritation told us...well in the summer people just wait outside.  Yeah well this is Feb...You have to figure our something for your waitees...So...we paid about 70.00 for a pizza and  the platter I described below...They did give us the Poutine to go...as at this point we were standing and just wanted out.  The manager gave us a gift certificate for a free pizza...   so what more could we want right?  Well, i guess I would have liked to have been  feeling like a had a meal and wasn't  hungry for my 70.00 pizza and platter, a safe adequate seating and perhaps not really to have had this escalate to where we felt the need to stand up to get someones attention.   So don't go on a weekend, unless you want  to take your chances...do NOT allow yourself to be seated in that front section...and be  prepared to pay a LOT for some differently spiced basics that there is too little of for the money. I don't know that we will give this another try again..as I understand the traffic thing was a one time thing...but I think the food was not worth the wait, or the cost versus adequate portions."}, {"review_id": "4E28kDGGQwpNqCUM_2V_Ow", "user_id": "FGSWY00KO24UGkE7rvWN3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Wow wow wow.

A group of 3 of us went together as first timers. Our server was Gregg. He was wonderful. The food was just as amazing. I started with the pork belly. It was phenomal! I could eat this daily and never grow tired if it. I had the baby iceberg salad as my meal. It was huge! Very flavorful. We shared the apple crisp dessert. I can see why they run out if their desserts so quickly. I tried a bit of tge pig skins that my friend ordered. Wow were they yummy!The drinks were all great too. I had \"That Whiskey Drink.\" The names of the items on the drink menu had us all cracking up. Well done Pig Tale!

In my opinion NH has a lack of quality restaurants, so I highly appreciate Pig Tale trying to change that. I love Pig Tale because it's menu is standard pub grub but with a bit of a fresh, inventive twist. The ingredients are local and fresh, and they don't even use a freezer! That's impressive to me that they value the importance of eating fresh and local food.I've had the burger and potato skins, both amazing. The pizzas look impressive as well. The staff are friendly and don't rush you.

They told me that this place purchased everything from local farms and even went as far as making their own cheese. I thought to myself ... Wow , I need to go to this place... So a few nights ago, that's exactly what I did.  I planned to meet a friend of mine that lives in Nashua at Pig Tale.      When I arrived, I was surprised to find it located in a strip type mall. I had imaginations of grandeur.  As we entered, the place was quaint with a rustic feel.  More like a BBQ place than fresh from the farm.  We were greeted promptly and were seated towards the back near the brick oven.  The menu was quite diverse and pretty intriguing. It was difficult to choose our selections as it would have been nice to try everything.       Funny enough we decided to try multiple appetizers so we could taste a variety of these wonderful selections.  We made our final picks and placed the order.       The first item to arrive at our table was the Poutine, The scent was amazing, crispy potatoes covered with sausage apple gravy covered with cheddar curd.  This dish was better than excellent. The little pieces of sausage packed with the taste of the Gods floating around  in an apple gravy like no other, not to mention the home made cheddar curd that was easily noticeable as made farm fresh. At this point my drive to New Hampshire was already worth it.      Next arrived salads, one Artisan Greens which consisted greens, with white balsamic, baby cherry tomatoes, and some english cucumber. It was fresh and crispy. The second salad was a Beet Salad, The star of this salad were the crimson and gold beets which were served with whipped goat cheese and Arugula.  The appearance of the beets amongst the fresh Arugula and accented with the best whipped goat cheese I've experienced.     At this point we decided to try out their Marrow on the half bone.  It was an amazing mixture of marrow along with mushrooms, parmesan and red wine gastrique. This dish was extremely rich and robust in flavor, absolutely perfect.     For drinks we went with Sangria, next time I will choose more wisely, not bad but after the amazing food I expected better.      Over all I would suggest to try anything out of the ordinary as our chooses were great, or anything that comes out of the fabulous brick oven."}, {"review_id": "ln9v2FisI9l8nwUkn_cmXA", "user_id": "98oNNCRvrPZ3-tHak186Ug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Great chicken wings to start our dinner.  We loved the shrimp scampi pizza.  Our server was great, attentive and prompt.
