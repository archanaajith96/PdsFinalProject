Comparable to the real place.I spent countless hours exploring their various vendors and food bars. They have everything: pasta station, pizza station, sandwiches, gelato, fresh produce etc. A big group of us stopped for lunch, and our meal was fresh, savoury and delicious. The portions are big, and was enough to take on the go for a snack.Price was super reasonable for NYC. The sandwich with a salad on the side was a little over $16.00!! (US)What a treat and experience this was!"}, {"review_id": "WskQH0wz8-Aj6ZjejhbYOg", "user_id": "ZK3gYRdo0qw_J0xyLB_G3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I really like Eataly. Although I am not from NYC and don't get the opportunity to shop there often, I enjoy this spot every time I am in the city. As the daughter of someone who has work din specialty grocery for the past 20 years, I can appreciate an eccentric grocery spot. I liked it because there were many items that I could bring home to Houston that weren't insanely costly. Also, they carry my favorite brand of italian haircare. If you are looking for a very busy, but extremely qualified italian grocer, Eataly is for you. The only thing I would change is not having to walk through the \"dining area\". I didn't have a problem with it, but it seemed like those seating there didn't appreciate all the people walking right next to their tables."}, {"review_id": "tcEt83KlwmYdig7EtssxXA", "user_id": "KCKMjBXwlybZrZ7Q1wUAPg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "5 Star food and zero star customer service.  I've had so many great experiences with eataly ordering plates for catering and using it as my grocery store.  However the customer service is appalling. In a recent visit, they forget to put my $11.47 worth of prosciutto in my bag.  Kinda was the highlight of my snacking dinner. I called the store right away. In the past they were very fast to refund. This time. Diego, in customer service had to check that in fact the item was forgotten. Tick tick. Next up more holds to give me a credit of $11.47. There were zero offers of - we're so sorry. Can we give you a $10 credit for next time you come in.  It took me 9 mins on the phone to get $11.47 refunded.  Isn't time money???I will probably still frequent here because they do have wonderful produce, cheeses and meats but the service here for 5 star pricing is something akin to zero stars."}, {"review_id": "rHHqzihaONffIjGAX2wT7g", "user_id": "LYOvyedhKD3eqs4dJrp6yQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I've been here probably close to a million-and-a-half times.

Order the board with cheeses, meats and spreads. Dunk the bread in their outrageous oils and sip their recommended wines. Watch the flow of people that go through and take in all the Italian voices. For dessert: either walk over to the Nutella station or pick an authentic cannoli. Be sure to walk out with an ice cream to go.

I love walking through here shopping and if I'm lucky enough to get a table in La Pizza/La Pasta... it's a good day.I typically have a pizza to remind me of Italy, but lately have tried a Cacio Pepe or a nice pasta penne Arrabiatta with sharing a caprese salad over a glass of wine and catching up with a close friend. The meat section, they have the best bar to sit and catch up over wine and nibbles, but the if I can get a few fresh items and I'm heading home after, I'll buy some meats and etc to take with me. Look, it gets touristy, but they have a clean bathroom and so many of them. Thanks Mario! I'm going to say... I prefer this Eataly to the others.

There were multiple, unique options for flavors and toppings. The line was long but moved quickly and promptly. I ordered the tiniest size they had (don't remember the exact name for the size) but could not finish it. As much as I wanted to chow down the rest, I was full from dinner- the serving portions were perfect, almost erring on the side of too much. Everyone in my family enjoyed the gelato and found something they liked. I am a big critique of sitting spaces (lol) and was not impressed by the lack of seating. There were many people milling about the area looking for seating. In the end my family stood in the room, unfortunately somewhat in the way, as there was nowhere else to go. But, yes! Check out the market and especially the gelato.

You also have a coffee bar, dessert bar, chocolate bar, NUTELLA bar etc. there's also different restaurants inside like the pasta/ risotto area, pizza area, vegetables etc. I love how the space is set up and most importantly the ENDLESS options. It's so interesting to see so much different products, and you can actually spend hours in here because there is so much!

Just like my Eataly case described, it was nothing but loads of fun. Open concept with open kitchens, infused with a bit of market style and open shops. You can eat and get your groceries done here. They have a wine section to itself next door. The gelato was AMAZING!!I could spend half a day here!

Truly I think you could be in here for hours and still miss something to see, eat, or buy. We stopped in on our 2nd day in NY just to look around and kill time before our show. Wow. You want fresh bread, no problem. Craving housemade pasta, they've got it.  Fresh fish, gelato, Nutella on everything, wine, pastries, on and on. You can get anything and everything you need to make a gourmet meal, including some table ware and wine glasses. We decided then and there to return to try out one of the many food spots they have as well. As I love gnocchi and they make their own we picked Riso e Risotto. My gnocchi was served with tender winter squash and sage with a light cheese sauce. Oh heavens. Best gnocchi I have ever had. Light and perfect. The dish was one of the best hands down. Hubby had risotto with Gorgonzola and pears. Enjoyed it quite a bit as well. We also had Peach Bellinis too. Served with fresh bread and olive oil. It was quite a delicious meal. I would love to return (and will) to try some of the other food areas here. The smells wafting throughout are so enticing.
