I love going for dinner and have really enjoyed the duck spring rolls as well as the crab and corn soup for starters. The seafood bouillabaisse includes clams, scallops, fish, shrimp and delicious toast. The shrimp and grits is another one of my favorites with sauteed shrimp, grits and a delicious white sauce.

The service was fantastic! Our servers shift ended halfway through our experience so we got to have two servers and both were just wonderful and accommodating. We both ordered the fried chicken sandwich, and I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken, I wish they'd had a grilled option and it would have been even better, but it was great even as it was. I got the lemon drop martini which I personally wasn't a huge fan of, it was exceptionally sour for something I'd consider a lemon drop, but it was still decent. The only real issue I had was with dessert, we ordered a basket of macaroons and they came in all kinds of flavors, but they seemed really really dry and hard to me. I will definitely be back, but it is a little pricey so next time I'll be more prepared as to what kinds of things I'll want to try."}, {"review_id": "mmj3JiyQORk9dcIbHZjzZw", "user_id": "z9TaP9kc3qgcXTFbv403Ow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I always enjoy Kitchen on George.

If you come after noon, when they can start serving alcohol, I'd highly recommend a reservation. We showed up when they opened, so they seated us right away. Heads up - their Sunday brunch is a buffet only ($30pp, which we discovered when we received the bill). That being said, it has plenty of choices for everyone, from waffles to omelettes made to order. Their crab and corn chowder was exceptional, especially paired with their jalapeño biscuits. If you come hungry, it's worth the money. Staff was very friendly, great ambience.

A+ for the service.  If the couple next to make were wondering if I was some VIP, that says a lot.  Normally I'd have to complain to get anything complimentary.  I didn't say a word and I got a free appetizer and beer.  #colormeimpressedOther than that, I've been coming here because of the excellent food and the nice atmosphere.  After today, I can come back for food, atmosphere and A+ service.  I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a nice meal or date night."}, {"review_id": "QSoYzf27zsa9YFdscRzFnw", "user_id": "gtLPI_VOWYG80fxBZO4a8A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Kitchen on George is consistently 'ok'.

My memory of that first time was mixed, but we decided to try it again. We were disappointed. The wait staff appeared overwhelmed & stressed even though the place was only about 1/3 full. We ordered & suddenly a waitperson arrived with a bowl of tempura fried green beans, which we hadn't ordered. The man disappeared, but came back a short time later with the dish, insisting that they were for us because we had to wait for our drinks?  Anyway, they were greasy & too salty & we ate little. My husband had the Lavender Duck & I had the salad & mushroom soup. Everything was over-salted. Even my husband, who salts everything, thought the duck was too salty. I liked the way the mushrooms were roasted in a pouch of bread & pasta, but the soup base was just too salty. I ate very little. The coup de grace was the fruit fly in my wine. I rescued it & put it on the table where it was still trying to fly. We showed our waitperson & she said that she could offer us a dessert, but we weren't interested. I felt she should have compted us the wine. Needless to say, we were unimpressed & really wondered why the restaurant had gotten some good reviews. It is always sad to give a poor review, but this place doesn't live up to the hype & we won't be back. For my money, I'll dine in Fairhope."}, {"review_id": "rbdegR6aifCnr-H-ZDxjbQ", "user_id": "9aJ_ckoe-p9lYmsb7Wfrgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "I enjoyed a fantastic meal at Kitchen on George.  The mushroom soup, the chicken pasta, and the ricotta cheesecake were all perfect.  Even the house-baked bread and seasoned olive oil were delicious.  Plus, the service was extremely friendly and fast."}, {"review_id": "HCvzrTF6ugQLHFWm3GmY9Q", "user_id": "cu7dbSfoi7BQIGEJJQYGzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Excellent!!

We never once guessed where our waiter was because he was always on time; orders were taken, drinks were given, questions were answered. What made it most impressive was he was also servicing the other 5-6 tables too. He never once seemed stressed. Food: -We felt like all portions were generous. -The best value were the oysters! We got about 9 medium-sized oysters. They were fried perfectly in cornmeal batter, but could've been saltier; it was a little bland. -The crabcakes come as a pair, about 1.5 inches high and wide apiece. Seasoned nicely and filled with crabmeat. -The special of the day was the beef filet, which was cooked to a perfect medium rare. -The shrimp and conecuh sausage pasta was delicious, but tasted like something you could make easily at home; it relied too much on the conecuh sausage. The shrimp were ginormous. Ambience:Dimmer lighting, comfortable, classy.
