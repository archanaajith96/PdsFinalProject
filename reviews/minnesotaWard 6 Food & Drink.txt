Came here out of a whim on a Thursday night around 7pm. The parking lot was super full, but by the end of the night there was less people. I wished they could expand a bigger parking lot. I originally intended to just order a drink and appetizer but I ended getting a meal. I ordered the the adult strawberry milkshake and grilled cheese sandwich and also came with fries. I wished there was tomato soup! (There might have been, but I forgot to check.) My friend ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich with poutine fries. Everything was delicious and the service was friendly! Our waiter checked in frequently, and refilled our water glass-- which I appreciate. I would return to this restaurant again!"}, {"review_id": "W_9HrjOGidh-815Ur1xYDw", "user_id": "R6TEmXzQ5SYrxxs2MiyH0A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I went here on Monday night after reading the great reviews. I had no idea it was trivia night so that was a surprise. This place is not huge but is cozy. There's a bar, booths and tables to sit at. I always like when restaurants have the kitchen exposed. It's a good sign that the food is served fresh and there's nothing to hide! I probably should have come here on a night when there wasn't trivia. It was so loud when they announced the questions and then they would play a music clip and that was blaring so loud over the speakers. I wasn't crazy about the food... I ordered the butternut squash soup and it was very lumpy (??) and barely warm. It just had a strange taste to it and wasn't the smooth, creamy texture you would expect from a squash soup. My friend had the poutine and he said it was fine. Overall, this place was fine but I don't have a raving review to give it. The staff was friendly and there is a free parking lot in the back."}, {"review_id": "CD86cU52YZvCad-8CVTPkw", "user_id": "TALk5su15OQRs08uk7qV1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This place is excellent.

Started with a round of drinks; I had the Old Fashioned (the drink by which I judge a bartender) and it was good! My husband had the Fitzgerald and it was delicious and refreshing. They had quite a few gluten free options and can make any burger or sandwich GF with a bun/bread substitute. I had the Reuben, made with in-house corned beef, and it was fabulous. The meat was tender, but had a delicious crust on some of the pieces. Paired with the gremolata fries which were KILLER. My husband had the new Piggy Burger and said it was great. The patty was made out of pork-belly and was topped with apple relish, pineapple bbq sauce, and pickles. The service was quick and the bartender was super nice. Overall, this is an East side staple and we will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "4H9m49jLfNjwFTsH7ZCR6Q", "user_id": "fCc93_Bt7hcPRo4o1SUuxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Why oh why can't Ward 6 be located in Lowertown?? If it was, it could be dangerous...because I'd be there every night.I had such a pleasant experience here from beginning to end. The building itself is a little peculiar, but once you step inside....the first thing you see is a big, beautiful wooden bar. The ambience is warm and inviting. My friends had been raving about the adult milkshakes for a couple of weeks. Being that I'm lactose intolerant, hate fruity drinks/cocktails (more of a vodka soda girl), and don't typically spend $8 a pop on anything alcoholic.... I had to step outside of a comfort zone. Since I have amazing friends who let me take sips of their drinks, I was able to sample just about every flavor offered. The strawberry one was hands-down my favorite. Dream Cycle was pretty good, too. My boyfriend ordered the Salted Nut Roll and it was loaded with caramel; tasted just like a sundae. They swear that these are alcoholic beverages but I could not taste a single hint of booze. Dangerous! I only had one, and I think I sucked it down in about 5 minutes. I'm sure I'll piss someone off when I say this, but let's please keep in mind the difference between a fact and an opinion: The best fried cheese curds are found here at Ward 6. Seriously. Everywhere I go, I feel like I'm being served chopped up fried mozzarella sticks when I order curds. The batter they use is so light; each bite is mostly cheese and not a mouthful of oil. The dipping sauces are okay but these babies are perfect on their own. I could eat a bucket of them. Our table sampled quite a bit of the menu. I can't remember exactly what everyone ordered, but I saw a veggie burger, flatbread pizza, fish n chips, and some kind of curry dish. My boyfriend told me that the flatbread was out of this world. Everyone was extremely pleased with their food.Lastly....we came on a Monday night to play trivia. It just so happens that happy hour starts when trivia starts at 8pm. $4 glasses of prosecco?? Yes please! Trivia here is extremely difficult. Like, you feel ashamed of yourself more often than not. The questions are based off of the NYT crossword puzzles, so they're meant to be difficult. BUT, the guy who is running the trivia is so much fun ... it kinda helped ease the sting of feeling like a complete moron.We WILL be back, trivia or not, because I need those cheese curds in my life and on a steady rotation !"}, {"review_id": "lNtwoznTpRgLnWH-MqP31Q", "user_id": "Dl8UzehqTZNMfuGksnvoRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Ward 6 has some of the best fries and cheese curds in the Twin Cities!

What a lovely location! The service was excellent (the place was also quite empty) but they were friendly, prompt and helpful. We got the health food (deep fried veggies LOL), house fries and their meatballs (which rotate flavors). The health food was tasty, it contained mushrooms, sweet potatoes, cauliflower and broccoli all lightly battered in tempura and fried. It came with a harissa hollandaise that I thought was okay but my friend loved. The meatballs were a good size and perfect for sharing. Lastly .... the fries! Delicious, covered in cilantro and fresh garlic with Parmesan. Absolutely to die for. Tips: there's ample parking in the back and when the patio is available.... sit outside!Also - try their Spumoni Lemonade.

It came with french fries that had some garlic, parsley deliciousness on them! So. Much. Food. Of course I had to try one of the adult milkshakes! Based on our waiters recommendation I had the salted nut roll milkshake, which was good but there were a few other ones on the menu that I think I would have liked even better. My hubby had the Burger and said it was good. He also had a cup of chili as did one of our daughters and they both really liked that.Our other daughter had the Grilled Cheese. It had a massive portobello mushroom on it along with tomato and a cheese spread. She loved it!

I ordered the chicken and waffles sandwich  Each component in the sandwich was very good by itself, but together it was not as fabulous as I hoped for.  It had lettuce and tomatoes and some sort of what I think was an aoli with maple in it?  I could not taste the maple and the waffle was way to soft, a sweet waffle as opposed to maybe a more savory waffle that had some strength to it. Next was the Bradburger which has pimento cheese in it.  Our server said they would cook it to your liking because it is Peterson grass fed beef.  Medium rare was ordered, we got medium well, (person behind us ordered same thing 20 minutes later, his was cooked perfectly).  Please don't ask how we want something done if you are not even going to try and get it close.The grilled cheese while tasty was burnt on the bottom side.  Sigh...Then the meatball appetizers were ordered for a main meal.  While tasty, they were barely warm, so they went back for some hot ones.Everything had great flavor and the fries are the best, but the experience was sort of a bummer.  One last thing, we really love this place, the service, the owner and the staff, so we will be back, but it just sort of bummed us out.  Just an off night?"}, {"review_id": "5KGB2OpGfuLyWz9QojSVDA", "user_id": "Snb_TYLgw6aRa1s3CgAxRw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/26/2017", "text": "I keep thinking I like this place more than I do. After my breakfast this morning, I'm convinced I can't go above 3 stars. I'll start with the good: There's a pretty great vibe in the space and all of the staff are there to make you feel welcomed. In fact, as we were walking out, every single staff we walked passed (host, bartender and waitress) wished us well for the rest of the day. That was nice :D The menu is creative with traditional items like \"Eggs for Breakfast\" (As you like 'em, served with hash browns and toast. Add meat for additional charge. $8) and then non-traditional items like \"Welsh Rabbit\" (No rabbits are harmed in the making of this traditional tavern dish-- cheese sauce on toast, simple and satisfying. Served with a slice of tomato and an over easy egg. $6). Prices are reasonable and their toast is delicious! The toast is buttery and grilled or something, it's not just thrown in a toaster. I really appreciate the strong East Side Saint Paul pride of this place.Things that could be improved: The booths are not comfortable. The coffee is mediocre. There aren't many fresh or light menu options - not recommended for a day with a busy schedule because you won't feel very active afterwards. Don't be wooed by the \"Dutch Baby\" (Not quite a pancake, not quite a popover, entirely yummy. Served with powdered sugar and fruit. $7) - I am completely puzzled by how the chef could taste this and feel confident enough with its flavor to put it on the menu. It's a beautiful dish, but you will be completely underwhelmed with the flavor. It's light and fluffy with a crusty outside, but it basically tastes like a moist sponge. I've never had one before, so maybe this is what it's supposed to taste like? It seemed well executed, but just was not my thing. On the other hand, because I barely touched it, the waitress did ask if it was okay and seemed like she was going to offer something in exchange, but our time was already up and I didn't want to make a big deal out of it by that point. Overall - I recommend it at least once to give it a try and make your own conclusion. I'll probably even go back, but it's dropped off my list of top restaurants."}, {"review_id": "N5wrrK-M_eog1l7AMWfoSw", "user_id": "-uglef88WEwkI6UlAqwO0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2017", "text": "My buddy and I were in St. Paul and our first place for dinner had a 30 minute wait, but we had to hit a Green Day concert, so we walked about 4 blocks south and saw Ward 6 on Yelp.

It's a small restaurant and bar and you may wait a bit for a table but you can grab a local craft beer at the bar while you wait. I have enjoyed dinner here a few times but today I came for brunch. I ordered their Bloody Mary and was happy I did. I also grabbed an endless cup of coffee and they offer you the choice of light or dark roast for just $2. Pretty sweet deal! For food I ordered the eggs Benedict and the eggs broke perfectly over the English muffin. The hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy and ham was pan seared. All together it was quite a delight and just the right amount of food for me. It was served with hash browns that were crispy and golden on the outside and perfectly cooked in the center. We also grabbed an order of beignets. The beignets had cardamom spice flavor and were golden on the outside. These were different and not overly sweet.
