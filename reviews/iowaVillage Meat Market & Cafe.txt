And the meat counter is great for taking home some of their delectable eats (Czech hot dogs and smoked salmon were wonderful samples)--packed on ice and headed back to MN!! Simple non-elegant and non presumptuous dining area matched with simply terrific food made me feel like I was home.Staff was wonderful as well"}, {"review_id": "wWe3AfiScN6NShvqg1zS6Q", "user_id": "ZniH00fnv9W1HjfL31avmQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "We had the schnitzel and the goulash and both were excellent.  We will definitely be back"}, {"review_id": "CD3oen-WXRu6-G0MAtJe2w", "user_id": "W02IG9JUwWQzJjvsIcuwsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/28/2017", "text": "This was such an amazing experience. We came here for the first time on an adventure, and this is going to become one of our regular spots. I had the muffaletta, which had this perfect bread and olive spread with a touch of olive oil. My husband had tomato goulash with a touch of heat. Begnets, perfectly touched off with powdered sugar (not too much, not too little) and home made apple butter. They had a live band playing smooth jazz, and it was the perfect amount of volume for the crowded room. They were amazing, I felt so relaxed and at ease. To touch it all off, the friendly waitress told us to stay and listen as long as we would like, they won't deliver our ticket to the table because they didn't want to imply that they wanted us to leave. Just pay at the counter when you are ready to go. I would recommend this little slice of NOLA to anyone looking for a great brunch/lunch spot. They even had butcher quality bones for my dog. Thank you!"}, {"review_id": "lHY8lCd8XueiCrutVAx1cw", "user_id": "00SRTQBsAcvpUBWIpSDg-g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "A solid choice.  We left satisfied.  Almost everything hit its marks.  Some aspects fell short but there's something lovable about the whole experience.  I'd go back.  It felt like dinner with family.  The beef sticks are definitely worth checking out.  Ground more finely than a typical landjaeger, flavors unfold like a nuanced, subtle Slim Jim -- it's a lovely experience.  And try the beignets, which are nothing like I've had in New Orleans, but are indulgently delicious in their own right."}, {"review_id": "rIgthzR7y5XQb8lx2vvkdQ", "user_id": "iVhpBBiPUiCqm8UtEZpLcw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "We had lunch one grey afternoon and thoroughly enjoyed the meal, the atmosphere, the music, the original decor and the friendly, helpful lady who served us.

I was surprised that you could get more than smoked meat here. If you aren't a big meat person, there are other options. It's a bit pricier than say Village Inn but it's definitely worth it. If you have company visiting from out of town and want to impress them with a fancy breakfast, come here. They have a lot of unique items but they also have some classics. We had everyone order something different and then, we all shared. My grandmother said that the Czech food is super authentic and that this is her favorite spot in Cedar Rapids. I'm a picky eater and I still enjoyed myself. Plus there's a lot to look at while you wait for your food."}, {"review_id": "_x3UhZvh_pegnftU38LTlg", "user_id": "ZwV80EfZmVbeflc_Q6NOMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Ate here on Saturday we were quite impressed with both service and food quality. Our little one decided on the beignets, they were authentic and awesome.  I had the ribs with fire and a side of the red cabbage slaw, the ribs were excellent, I really enjoyed that they didn't have sauce on them. My husband had the butcher loaf sandwich and thought the twist on meatloaf was a nice change. I thought it had a similar flavor to my Czech grandfathers cooking and I also found that delightful. Our picky teen got the pulled pork and fries and declared it a tie with qdogs (which is quite saying a lot for her), I didn't try her pork so not sure, but if she is happy, we are all happy. We came in about 12:30 and the place was completely full, but we only had to wait about five minutes for a table to free up. They had two local musicians playing some great jazz and interacting with the patrons. We will most definitely be returning sooner rather than later."}, {"review_id": "ercIufTKlPAgRFTWHWV4_A", "user_id": "y3MoSOid3kZs92SJ9cqTvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "My husband and i went for the first time today. The service was fantastic even though we came just before they closed. The food was unbelievable. The bacon was thick and crispy, but not chewy, the eggs were cooked perfectly, the hash browns were crispy and cooked evenly and the bread was toasted on each side but still soft in the middle (Perfect for sneaking into my husband's goulash, which was indescribably tasty). We finished off with an order of beignets, which made me wish for a second stomach. I wish I could give them all the stars in the sky, but I guess 5 will have to do."}, {"review_id": "aaNBp-MFbROjKaF5gunFXA", "user_id": "bZbyv8Eq7JImHg0Jf-JIrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "Excellent food and atmosphere.  Sausage and Kraut with German potato salad and brown bread hit the spot on a cold day.  Bryce playing great blues music.  I wanted to stay all day.  I will definitely go back!"}, {"review_id": "ggCGKpJzeZTUOTVTCA5EAA", "user_id": "CSSrG084Rm70-4AddwonmQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/8/2016", "text": "I love this place.  The food is both reasonably priced and tastes fabulous.  The sniztel was very tender and breaded to perfection.  I find them calling their rueben a rueben to be a bit silly, but with the bread they use and the quality of their corn beef they can call it whatever they want.  The german potato salad is very good and something different.  The food here is also fairly fast.  Best place in CR to me"}, {"review_id": "UlyJBLUT-kFFTEImVS7dZw", "user_id": "IcU2n6r43RD9rbyeULyjGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/25/2016", "text": "Such a cool place and the food was delicious!

It is a deli/meat counter in front, long communal-seating tables in back with Czech-themed decor. There was a lovely classical guitarist when we stopped by on a Sunday afternoon.We had Czech dog with fries and a Reuben with steak soup. Both meals were excellent but the steak soup was the standout. Bright flavor (unusual for this often heavy type of soup) with great textures. They smoke all meats in house. We picked up brisket and bacon to go.
