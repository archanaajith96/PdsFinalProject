The restaurant is not very big but it's super comfy and the atmosphere is welcoming.  I would go as far as say this is my favorite sushi place in Delaware, I had zero complaints about the service or the food. Prices are reasonable.If you're looking for great fresh sushi, visit this place.

Not only does the sushi taste fresh, but the variety of rolls available is amazing. Because I've liked every roll, the options make it hard to choose just one during my visit :)I've ranked this place a four simply because there is limited parking and the restaurant is quite small. I do appreciate the intimate and peaceful environment, but the lack of space does present an issue when they are busy."}, {"review_id": "mQV2WE-L0tb9ppWLMvAQjg", "user_id": "rjk1LgwNWJvns0yJgE80eA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "***PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING COMING HERE. I recently visited on a Saturday during lunch. We were probably the first customers during Lunch. We dined there for about 30mins, during which no one came. If the lack of business wasn't indication enough, the sashimi and sushi was subpar. I ordered the Sashimi entree and it came way too quickly. When I tasted it, it was clearly recently defrosted fish, NOT FRESH at all! You can taste the extra water from melted ice as you bit into the sashimi. The fish even tasted a bit weird, not sure how long they've stored it. I decided to visit this place because it has gotten really good reviews recently, but the food was no where near the quality that the reviews promised. Furthermore, for all those of you whom were wondering/curious, this place is owned by a korean family. They placed korean songs and consistently spoke korean during my visit. They ARE NOT Japanese for some of the reviewers who had thought so."}, {"review_id": "O0LIACEMAxHuRP4wcvjjDw", "user_id": "r2nAdxZJV8lOCYWFxmhQGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Found this place based on yelp reviews for good sushi and really enjoyed it.

Dragon Maki does not look just amazing, it taste amazing as well. The sashimi is a little thicker than normal. Not complaining but be prepare to enjoy more than what you can handle. I would reduce the amount of sashimi by half on your order. The firebird roll is not just entertaining but tasty as well. I would recommend ordering it as well.  End it with their tasty Mochi. Choose any flavor that suits your palate."}, {"review_id": "CDBGcnOnqlwuQ1ClgoFdvg", "user_id": "FbNXujzkyC97Zp2vouY5Cw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2017", "text": "I am so glad we stumbled upon this place! We love to sit at the sushi bar and watch the chefs work. They are so nice and even with some language barriers, all is overcome by the language of great food. The atmosphere isn't spectacular but it's homey and well taken care of. It's not on the menu but get the smoked salmon belly sashimi with ponzu sauce...you'd think you were in NYC at a $$$$ sushi place. These guys are really creative but also know the beauty of simple done perfectly. Hands down best sushi in town--makes mikimotos look like the joke it is."}, {"review_id": "hDQBdzxyObDwAaFQbWw3TA", "user_id": "8Y-y_44b0cJz3GAwOixT1Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/15/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm sorry to do this, but I have been annoyed after my last two experiences. They used to give complimentary miso soup and salad with every order, dine in or takeout. A few weeks ago when I dined in, they only brought soup. Today when I ordered one roll for lunch ($7.95), they didn't include either. This may seem like I'm being petty or cheap, but they have set a standard for customer expectations, and they should stick to it. Because people expect it, they should ask, \"would you like to  add soup or salad for $x?\"This is still a great place for dinner, but I would skip it for lunch. They have no sushi lunch specials, unlike nearly ever other sushi spot. It's a shame their popularity has resulted in poor customer service."}, {"review_id": "sHlGh9qoErsOHG52rh9KDw", "user_id": "6ANbFZozd58vU9EQT7Kfvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Awesome sushi, really nice music, and the staff is friendly with great service, very clean and beautiful small restaurant"}, {"review_id": "qTtw9aMXhA6icHBYQ7V8Cw", "user_id": "PtBT5d7IfRmA46HVxWKMcg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "I love this place.  Boyfriend and I love the sushi .

She was fighting with the customer about the quality of Uni and its freshness while arguing with the sushi man about the other waitress who took too much time on her break.It's Korean Japanese so not really that authentic but doable for sure. I liked the cucumber roll and green tea but everything else was not so fancy.  It's a decent place that can use some help. It seems a bit run down and can probably use a face lift soon."}, {"review_id": "PL1xEeE1ExlXpzo4eFtGcA", "user_id": "cTgEuhn6mWYHycE2wMGOQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "I am a travel nurse here from Phoenix,  AZ.

I came in for a late lunch/early dinner with my husband. We took advantage of the happy hour which was a few lower priced beers and 20% off specialty rolls.We ordered the fried pork dumplings, double spicy roll, spicy trio, mackerel sashimi, Sapporo beer (not part of HH) for the hubby and hot sake (not part of HH) for me. We asked for brown rice, but they only have white. The rolls came with salad with sesame dressing (delicious) and miso soup for both of us. I would have rather had real greens vs iceberg lettuce but it came free with the sushi so cant be upset. We also actually ordered the dumplings steamed but the fried dumplings still were good- had a good flavor. The miso soup was typical. The sushi rolls itself were yummy. It had very good flavor.
