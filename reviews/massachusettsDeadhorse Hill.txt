Got a res for 12:30 showed up and were quickly seated by the window with a request. Friendly and excited to learn we were first timers. Server arrived (Molly D) and was happy to explain the menu and answer our questions. I pretty much knew what I was getting but she was happy to answer questions regardless. I ordered a matcha latte and my friend got a schlatte (foamy iced shaken latte) and they arrived quickly and he schlatte was in a fun old school McDonald's cup. We decided on the prix fixe menu for $25 per person (everyone on table must do it per the menu) and each started with the salad. Lightly dressed and small chunks of grapefruit blu cheese and pine nuts. Perfect starter. Our food arrived quickly (within 10 minutes of our salads which was perfect timing) and don't skip the duck fat taters and bacon. Friend got the Salmon Benedict and says to never ever get rid of it. The house smoked lox was some of the BEST both of us have ever had. The English muffin was perfectly toasty and soft and the eggs were poached well. The hollandaise was also fabulous. Not too heavy and we kept it on the side for the taters. I got the chicken thighs and waffles since I'm on a mission to find the best in the state per my reasoning. This place is known for their fried chicken thighs (and for good reason) the breading was crispy flavorful but not over powering.  Somewhat greasy but what do you expect. They do have the bones in them so that was annoying when you just wanna dive in. But they were fabulous none the less. The waffle I have mixed feelings on. I like a Belgium style (thick) waffle with my chicken & waffles. This was a regular old waffle. However- the batter is fantastic. The flavor was spot on not sure what it was but we both got a vanilla bean kind of taste from it. My problem with a thin waffle is they get soft and mushy easily. Had this problem by the end. It is served with what I assume is a house hot sauce and I asked for honey on the side. The honey was delicious hot sauce as well but be cautious it has a bite. Overall this place was a win. The Benedict was fantastic and the chicken is incredible. We will definitely be back to try more in the future.My friend added that the place is large. You probably wouldn't need to wait too long even on a busy day because of the size. The environment is modern and the lighting is fun. The cafe is also super cute."}, {"review_id": "FKoyEv9RSo_VWYPgdEAecQ", "user_id": "xiuE0nVdBWCMhkCExai8Dw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "We enjoyed a quiet Tuesday evening at DHH with a few friends, lots of shared plates, and attentive service from the staff. The food was delicious and well plated, and the drinks were creative, well made and served/suggested with helpful commentary. The atmosphere was casual, airy, and the seating was comfortable enough to ignore. Parking wasn't the easiest, even on a holiday week Tuesday.

The bone, however, was fantastic. The meat was good, but not a hundred bucks good.The apps - sausage, duck, etc. - came with a LOT of filler. The sausage was $16.00 (I think) and had maybe 1/2 a sausage in there with bread and veggies galore. You kinda had to hunt for it.It's in Worcester and it has buzz, and it doesn't have any real competition, so Deadhorse will be allowed to get away with it."}, {"review_id": "roofibdwAxCxqjnEnwlSbg", "user_id": "NGh05qVx7u7dTm39b-MQhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Went here last Thursday for dinner as we were passing by.  What a great surprise. Very friendly greetings and seating.  Ordered the 5 course set dinner at the mercy of the Chef/ kitchen. What a great surprise. Quality of good is excellent and demonstrates  the work of real chefs. A great culinary education. Service by a team was friendly ,professional and non intrusive. Our daughter joined us half way through our meal and the table move was painless. A reasonable wine list but perhaps biased towards the younger palette.  Ambience and seating is great. Great night .

This place starts with a beautiful space that is obviously well thought out. Add a wonderful staff and equally amazing fresh food and you could ask for a better dining experience. We started with the oyster and poke which were fresh and flavorful. Then I had the mutton which was tender and delicious, but my husband had the artic char which I ate most of! Add the fact that the cocktails were skillfully crafted and you have a better dining experience.

We had a reservation for 7 which went swimmingly but when we got there; it took a complete nose dive. Our waitress was an absolute peach but the food was just god awful. Everything was either burnt or just unappetizing; one of my friends even found a hunk of plastic in his pasta! For the prices here I would recommend just going to McDonalds, your probably be a lot happier to be honest."}, {"review_id": "owKT-j0hsjvWT_GjDi0JTw", "user_id": "aGJnMKMTt0oy-kOewd0ysA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "I contacted Deadhorse to hold my Mum's 70th birthday celebration, and they accommodated my family and I in a very friendly and welcoming manner.

I'd move back to Wormtown just for Deadhorse Hill. Chef Jared has created an eating oasis spotlighting sheer culinary genius. Start off with Mem Tea (Cambridge) and Tandem (Portland ME) and Chocolate Babka and some crazy good French muffin sort of thing, filled with a caramelized sugar cube (forgot the name but gee wiz, what the heck..pure ambrosia). Then move on to the house cured salmon found in my omelette and sitting atop Grammy's eggs benny. HOLY COW, salty good. The house made jams topped my super delish home made English Muffin.  I did not want this meal to end. This is the best of the best in Wootown. I am in love with every aspect of Dark Horse Hill."}, {"review_id": "5lRLdioKdeKExnVlRefDFQ", "user_id": "YAZd4MzlQ-IaW_Hyj9_7Ew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "As a proud Worcester native, I love seeing new businesses pop up around the city...but this one is sincerely special. First of all, the drinks are superb. Sometimes I take out of town friends to restaurants and although the food is good, the drinks leave something to be desired. Well, that isn't the case at Deadhorse Hill where drinks are clearly well thought out and tested before they're out on the menu. Second, the food is delicious. Every time I go there are new menu items that wow me. Seriously good food."}, {"review_id": "bxmiBmod6TCeJXtKMgZkEQ", "user_id": "QNkAmeGc9MKuzq_82E9tLw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Super pricey for what you get. I'd hope that the price would be a little lower to allow for us to get multiple courses so we could leave full. Instead we decided it'd be better to grab some fast food afterwards (yes we really did go to McDonald's after we came here lol) but I must say the food is FANTASTIC! BEST food quality restaurant I've EVER been to and we eat out a lot anywhere from Top of the Hub, Fogo De Chao to local spots like Jimmy's Grille & Tavern and man this place blew all previous restaurants away! The price may stop us from going as often as we'd like but for special occasions I'm willing to drop the money to get my tastebuds dancing!"}, {"review_id": "kawZdCOPYKWGD5ytNMADTg", "user_id": "3kXn82dO9CQnjuVUWc0eyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/28/2017", "text": "Five stars all the way! I can only rate the food on the fresh homemade sourdough with salt and pepper buttah schmered around the bowl and the oh my god orgasmic, yes that's right people. Orgasmic fried chicken thigh! And I am by far not a fried chicken person. But this one changed myLife forevah! We hung out at the bar with one of the owners, Shaun while he made a wonderful old fashioned and poured some amazing brews and bubbles for me. This place has a nice vibe to it. Funky class with a side of artsy fartsy. Cool chandeliers with modern clean feel. For entertainment you have one of the bartenders to watch while he shake faces and stirs all at the same time while holding a conversation. Talent my friends. The menu looks amazing and the food smelled amazing. I was a food creeper to my bar neighbors. Please people go check this place out. I know we will be heading there again to eat an actual meal.

I like complex and unique food and don't mind paying good money for it, but this place, in a word is PREPOSTEROUS. It is a parody of itself. The service was cloying and tedious. All of our plates came out 15-20 minutes apart. The scallops were delicious but there was a full, crunchy teaspoon of sand in every bite. The food was all average to bad. It was puzzling and odd to be odd. Our server(s) were nice, but there had to be 26 visits over our stay. It was bizarre. The food presented complexity for its own sake with the results being average to off-putting. Even the pancake was undercooked and presented an odd combination of un-harmonious flavors. They were visibly baffled that we did not want to take home what we left behind. Will not ever go back. I love Worcester and all of the restaurateurs making a go of it, but this place needs to get off its high horse."}, {"review_id": "XyuI5-WRFc96AcSxiOwAag", "user_id": "zF0wuFMzEm7nZuBZ_WsQ5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "Super unique dining experience. Menu is designed almost like a tapas place (small plates, usually 3-5 orders for 2 people to share). I enjoyed the special pancake with braised pork, pumpkin tortellini soup & the fried chicken thighs. The pancake is for people that like seafood because there are seafood ingredients in it (my bf was sad after tasting it, haha). The tortellini is VERY small, so don't expect luscious tortellinis with a lot of stuffing. I loved the broth though, had a nice tang. Chicken thighs were delish. Super crispy & perfectly paired w/ their sauce. Could've used more sauce though. Otherwise, a very good dining experience w/ awesome service."}, {"review_id": "UQOBDZZlaS5-cJpQDy7eEg", "user_id": "CWVecc1z3hrZcJ9g08-b1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "All the dishes we had were phenomenal.
