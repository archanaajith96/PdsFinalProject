(Check out the animal paintings which depict some of the original staff, so cool.)  It's amazing to me the 5 Star reviews around town for truly subpar restaurants. I can only assume these folks have never experienced Brick 29. Ok, so it may be in Nampa (which by the way is a super cute town)... but, for those who fear traveling past Eagle, well, you're missing out. These guys and gals know their way around great food. So far, all things considered, this is one of my top 3 restaurants in the valley."}, {"review_id": "M41VU6eCvkwypsdCXSVIFg", "user_id": "ZFMCV7aa-QKd2338kmNZQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Had a bad day at work, decided to go out to eat and have a good time. I'm kind of new to Nampa area, and I heard about this place being a very nice spot. Out of the places I've reviewed so far, this one is THE BEST place I've eaten at. From the food, to the service, to the atmosphere & vibe, this place is amazing.To start off, my party of 3 came in around 3:30PM, got seated immediately right next to a window. If you can, make sure you ask to sit next to the windows. This place is on the 3rd story of a building, so the view is pretty cool! You're able to see the snow covered mountains in the distance! The interior is modern, nicely lit, and clean. Bathrooms are REAL NICE ;)We found out that happy hour starts at 4PM, but we were real hungry, so decided to order off their regular menu. We ordered the Mac & Cheese entree, the Flat Iron Steak entree, and the Tenderloin Cobb Salad (I attached all the pics to this review for you guys to look at and get hungry). Everything came out real fresh and delicious, absolutely no complaints at all. The steak wasn't as big and juicy as you get at Texas Roadhouse, but the overall presentation & taste was good & unique. The sauce that it came with was tasty. After we finished that, it was already time for Happy Hour. We placed another order, this time  for the B29 Fries w/ Bacon, Mac & Cheese (Happy Hour portion is half the size of the regular, but same amazing taste), B29 Mule, glass of wine, Black Widow, and for dessert, Creme Brulee. The food was fresh, drinks were refreshing. Honestly, I have absolutely no criticism for this place.The B29 fries w/ bacon were so good, I just HAD to dedicate a small paragraph on it. The fries were hot, crispy, and the garlic and little green onions were perfect. There's some kind of sauce that's drizzled on the fries, and that sauce is a must, trust me fam.Our waitress, Keesha, was friendly, very nice and polite. There was another woman who was stopping by our table as well, perhaps the owner or manager, just checking up on things, and she was very nice & polite as well. I always wonder how people manage to be happy and friendly all the time, but she was joking with us, and I really felt comfortable there. This is the best place I've reviewed so far, and overtakes my love for Moe Joe's in Meridian. Although Moe Joe's is a breakfast place, and Brick 29 isn't, the overall package beats out Moe Joe's, in terms of taste, presentation, service, and atmosphere. And y'all already KNOW how much I love Moe Joe's (go read my other review, and if you haven't eaten there, close this review down and head there ASAP).Now, for the recommendations, if this is your first time here and you're trying to ball on a budget, come here during happy hour and order the B29 fries w/ bacon, as well as the mac & cheese. Then, if you're still hungry, you can order an entree, I'd really recommend the Tenderloin Cobb Salad, that thing was amazing, and for the price it was a very good value, IMO. Out of the drinks, the B29 was my favorite, but honestly, you can't go wrong with anything here. Overall, as a complete package, this place is A1. The food, the atmosphere, the way the bathrooms are (yes, the bathrooms were so clean and modern I had to mention them TWICE), the fact that it's on a 3rd story of a building, and the service was probably one of the best packages I've experienced. YOU BETTER BELIEVE I'LL BE COMING BACK. If you're visiting Nampa, I would consider this place a MUST VISIT."}, {"review_id": "OVPEKqRl1HMKSwPqh4LEMA", "user_id": "DcQVL13SFJ1Oa_6Bgcfjpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great little hidden gem. We met friends we hadn't seen in a while and ate great food, visited and made another long time memory.

It's that good. The food is made with fresh ingredients, many local, and are really tasty. Standouts are the aged rib eye steak, the Oyster Club (BEST.OYSTER.SANDWICH.EVER), the lamb shank and the Hagerman Trout. I will update the review after 50 visits or so when I've tried everything on the menu! Cocktails are great, the Huckleberry Martini is a knockout. And an amazing creme brûlée!

But it isn't without its problems.My husband, mother, aunt, uncle, and cousins dined here while we were in town for my grandfather's funeral. We all ordered a wide variety of things, and overall were very satisfied with our dishes. I ordered the burger, and it was very flavorful, juicy, and I would order it again.Prices were typical for a place like this, but that is pricey.The one star deduction is for the staff. We did not receive bread after being seated, even though we saw other tables get it, and when we asked for it we only received one basket with five slices - we were a party of eight. We asked for another basket, and had to remind our waitress again for it. The staff was also pretty cold, and kind of snooty.The ambiance is that bland, brick and wood, wanna-be wine cellar vibe, with little character, but still a nice change in Nampa.It's important to note that if you want to dine here during prom season, make a reservation. We made one simply because we were a large party, we overheard others getting turned away because they were full, and as we looked around throughout our dinner we noticed that quickly half the place filled up with prom dates."}, {"review_id": "glxrtQbwTNlI-r3Dc2Ug0g", "user_id": "C92i8Bc-hPRojBCUW0G5Yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Was on a three week road trip.

And it was absolutely stunning. It's like Nampa Idaho finally has a real restaurant. When you walk in it's a single room with one elevator that takes you up to the third-floor to the stunning new dining area which is Modern elegant and embodies a treasure Valley feel. The food was amazing as always. The drinks were also delicious and I really appreciate having a view of downtown to gaze upon so happy to see this with in our area and excited to visit this restaurant again."}, {"review_id": "diIoOUZ12A78U9Z_X1y5tA", "user_id": "iyFDgHJei_2N73vL7MOKnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This was absolutely fantastic.  The staff was very professional,  and our waitress Justine was phenomenal!

Why would I with all the great restaraunts and things to do in Boise! The other night a friend suggested we meet and try Brick 29...she works in Nampa and said she's eaten there before and its amazing! We were excited to try it.Ok ok ok...soooo not trying to sound like a snob here...and I do believe in giving places a second chance, but for all the hype I thought this place was mediocre at best! My eating companion agreed with me as well.I had the pork special and I have to say it was tender and good...not amazing, but definitely good! My wife had the fillet...and honestly they smothered it in a mayonaise sauce and the beef was chewy(just ok). A fillet should speak for itself!! Should be tender and delicious, especially for what they are charging!I have to tell you I was excited for the \"ambiance\" because it was mentioned in a lot of reviews. The outside building is really cool...an old brick theatre type building. However...the inside was disappointing...run down with big holes in the wall, with insulation exposed and covered in plastic...not great!BUT WAIT THERE IS GOOD NEWS!!!! The drinks are amazing!!! The bartender is top notch and the drink combinations were fantastic!!! Our table had the Huckleberry Martini(yum), the Basil Lemon Martini(so refreshing), and the Manhatten(which tasted more like an old fashioned, which I love, so it worked) and a Long Island(even it was good)! Go there for happy hour and try the drinks...maybe sample an app....but as far as the food, it is over priced, and in my opinion doesn't deliver!"}, {"review_id": "TBnL542mLSAUMb5GKnjrzA", "user_id": "pjYF6vJ_aJI_7hNK96DTUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/31/2017", "text": "Just wanted to compliment the Owner/Chef and his staff for the fabulous luncheon they put on for our ladies luncheon last Saturday.

I didn't even care about my double digit side after I received it. Totally worth it. Everyone's food looked amazing. It's my first time to Nampa and I was looking for a restaurant that resembled the norm in Richmond, VA and this place hit the nail on the head. The atmosphere was lovely. A little European with the tables so close together but I love that. The hostess accommodated our party of 12 immediately and our waitress was amazing. Take a date here. Take a friend here. Eat here alone. It doesn't matter, this place is yummy.
