These people are saints for putting up with all the drunk people walking down King Street until 2 in the morning. And despite dealing with that chaos all night, they were kind and professional and served exceptional food.They have a limited menu that looks fairly simple, but you really can't go wrong.

In short, what a huge disappointment. Highly overrated. 1) The biscuits are good, not anything jaw dropping. We waited in line for 40 minutes in the afternoon, and waited patiently for what we thought would be the highlight of our Charleston vacation. What we were greeted with was grumpy staff (more details below), long lines, dry biscuits, iced coffee without straws, and $20 bakers dozen tiny biscuits, each the size of 4 quarters in diameter. 2) The working conditions and employees: what a sweat shop! I 100% think the working conditions and overworking of these employees is the root cause, not team morale. Even if they wanted to hire more people, where would they fit!? It seems like Callie doesn't seem to mind, given she wasn't there anyway, but the workers legit have 2 feet of walking space in the \"kitchen\". It was an awful experience to see them cramped trying to fulfill orders, replace supplies, dangerously fill orders and deal with a broken WiFi Square register. I'd be upset too if I was forced to work in these conditions, and you could feel the stress from their faces. Moreover, the space affects the customers as well. We had our backs to the wall holding our receipt for an addition 20 mins while the staff and other customers maneuvered in panic. 3) Simply overrated. I've had frozen biscuits from the grocery store that were better than this experience. Absolutely dry and not worth the wait or price. We thought it was just the flavor we purchased, but no - all three of our bakers dozen were so dry, tiny and bland! In short, this is an overhyped place by the \"Pinterest\" type. Callie should spread the love and care more about her employees working conditions and customers who pay top dollar for overrated biscuits, especially since it looks like she is doing more than well for herself.4) We were going to purchase Callie's biscuit mix when we saw it being sold by a vendor at the city market, but we thought we'd buy it directly from Callie to support her business and maybe get it a little cheaper. We noticed the price at Callie's location compared to the vendor was almost 20% higher! What a rip off! This really tells me that Callie does not care about her customers, who go out of their way to support her business."}, {"review_id": "YSjkbQX-IdBB7L3qJ9wv8g", "user_id": "4BOIofr9AqGSGoyTLTgoJA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "My wife and I are not the biggest biscuit lovers, but I have had a few personally over my life time that have given my soul life. So when we got to Charleston, I was excited to try out a highly rated spot. Callie's doesn't quite live up to that billing of other biscuit shops I have tried, but it was a decent biscuit. We got the bacon and sausage biscuit sandwiches along with the three biscuit combo to get a smackling of everything. The biscuit itself is soft (on the inside), moist, and crumbles well. The eggs were fried well with a little runny yoke, which was perfect. The sausage and bacon were not anything special. Sausage was not very juicy and the bacon was not the thick, crispy fat cuts I expect from shops like this. The black pepper bacon biscuit and the bacon sandwich could have been more generous with the bacon. You kinda got lost in the carb. I found myself being like Jim Gaffigan \"I want more!\" The blackberry jam and cinnamon biscuit were both excellent combinations with the perfect balance of sweetness and carb. Service was quick and efficient. Overall, 3.5/5 stars for us, but we'll round up for yelp. If we find ourselves in Charleston again, we may gander back if we are in the biscuit mood."}, {"review_id": "obflmwEeO2cuwoFwOqsgTw", "user_id": "hj7o_BPgj-HdLAxdKqdx-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Welp, it's official. I've had my favorite biscuit of all time. And now I'm crying because I don't live in Charleston.This is a teensy little spot, only a few seats along the counter/wall. I'm sure it gets packed on the reg, but we went right before a big rush and only waited about 5 min. Consider grabbing biscuits to-go (I ate mine in the street like an animal... I couldn't wait, they're that irresistible!)I opted for the biscuit trio -- the cheddar chive was my absolute favorite so light and fluffy, they're all so fluffy. Melt in your mouth good. I also had the basic buttermilk with whipped butter and the blackberry (which is a biscuit cut in half with jam inside). They all were a delightful way to start my day, and now I'm kicking myself for not buying the mix, which they sell in the shop. They also have frozen packs and cookbooks, etc. If you're heading to Charleston, this is a must-visit for the greatest biscuits that ever did exist! You can buy them online too... there's a 100% chance I'm doing that."}, {"review_id": "q_5zccxPCYlVsm_bHeuNPQ", "user_id": "mwAiDLWO4c30tNxNwoLg-Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "No, I'm not a fan of Callie's Hot Little Biscuit. This place has been on my radar for a while, but I won't be back.I came here with my boyfriend late Saturday night and we ordered a variety of biscuits. Really going for the whole experience here. We ordered the Bacon, Egg, and Cheddar, Sausage, Egg, and Cheddar, and Chicken Biscuit. None of them came out hot as expected. They also did not taste fresh. The batch had no flavor and didn't taste spectacular.  The piece of chicken was disappointing. I still can't get over the little piece of chicken they put in the sandwich. I can't say much more for the biscuits, but service was exceptional. Cashier was really sweet.  So, they also add an additional dollar for each \"late-night\" biscuit.. Originally $7.95, \"late-night\" biscuits were $8.95 each. I don't mind paying good money for good food, but nothing was worth the money I spent that night. And if that wasn't enough, they charged us for LITTLE cups of plastic water as well. Really trying to capitalize on the late night drunchies..  Sure it's a fancy, cute, spot, but it just felt like each step was a way for them to make money. Glad I didn't have to go to the bathroom.."}, {"review_id": "Ctm1ooOlDMC_FMFTHbeTqg", "user_id": "Ko_PDCCLckuEy8veApoipw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "This place was recommended to us by a local bartender. There was a short line when we arrived on an April Thursday morning. They had a lot of biscuit-centric options, including various biscuit flavors and sandwiches. We went for the biscuit trio, in which you get to choose three of the biscuit flavors. The blackberry biscuit was particularly good. None of the flavors required any add-ons. They also sell coffee, which was nothing special. The country store feel of the front area was a lot of fun. They sold local honey, biscuits, and other products.

I've tried a biscuit from Callie's in the market before and it was good but I never had the opportunity to go to their king street shop.We heard it gets packed so we went early Saturday morning around 8:30 and waited in a short line. The place is VERY small so it is hard to not feel in the way of others. Ordering was very easy but again, didn't really have anywhere to wait without being on top of others. Food came out quick and we were able to grab a spot at their small counter. Ordered water but never received, and honestly didn't want to fight passed the line of people to ask again. Ordered biscuit sandwiches and also the 3 for $5 sample.Everything looked fantastic and the biscuit sandwiches were huge! It was delicious and everyone seemed to enjoy it but I wouldn't be running back every weekend. Especially as we left around 9:15 the line was out the door!I did like their punch cards! You get a punch for every $5 spent which is nice. Overall really cute decor, nice staff, big sandwiches.

We tried a few, and they were all great except for a chive biscuit that just tasted like it's been hanging around on the counter for too long. But as you can see, even that wasn't enough for me to detract a star because the others were amazing - I suppose you could play it safe and just ask which ones were their freshest. They also have some specialty sandwiches - all of which had meat on them but the person behind the counter offered to make one with just the oven roasted tomatoes and other fixin's for me, which was greatly appreciated and DELICIOUS!

Order at the register and wait...mine took about 5 minutes. I ordered the sausage, egg and pimento cheese biscuit. Thought it sounded good. I was dead on. It was amazing...messy...but delicious. When I bit into it the fried egg just exploded with yellow gooey golden nectar!! The flavors work...I was so into it I used my finger to grab every morsel afterwards.

Last night my biscuits were really salty and kind of hard, almost like stale. And also, not hot. But my biggest issue is the wait. And on top of the wait, I'm paying a pretty penny for a little biscuit. That combination isn't a good feeling. There were many people who ended up canceling their orders, and we almost did.
