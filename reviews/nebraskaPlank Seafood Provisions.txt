Being from the West coast, we were skeptical of the seafood but the HH oyster price was too good to be true. Service--we sat at the bar but the staff was super friendlyAmbiance--hip, happening place full of buzz. Food--what?!?!  Soooo good and for a great value. We ordered a dozen oysters (from Virginia) and got 3 free one's from the Yelp check in. The clam chowder had real clams. Abundance of clams.  The old bay seasoning peel and eat shrimp were also delicious. Definitely recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "--t1ISJnMlp3fqvOrTjR8A", "user_id": "VxIgcRrT-_KlJNLTKRhYcw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "They understand the power of a good sauce! YASSS! Off cobblestone streets in downtown Omaha on a corner in Old Market. I was drawn in by the photos I saw of oyster platters and claims of fresh seafood in Nebraska. They have happy hour all day on Sunday's and a line at the door by noon when they open. Naturally we ordered three courses and drinks. The happy hour oysters which were Mobjack that day, potato calamari, blackened catfish, and a dark n stormy cocktail. My jaw dropped when I saw the check, probably one of the cheapest seafood excursions we've made.The freshness is obviously different than eating seafood on the coast, but they developed great flavors with sauces and gravy. Most notably on the catfish. I will say, however, the catfish had a bit too much salt for my taste, definitely needed a glass of water to go with it. The fried calamari was small and we had several fully fried intact tiny squids, but once again we're not on the ocean and it was certainly tasty regardless. The service was wonderful, the decor bright and modern, and the food displayed nicely. I would recommend giving this a try if you enjoy homey, buttery, comfort seafood!"}, {"review_id": "_6TCod0Xe6wTVd6IIgfLiA", "user_id": "bFJQ6lpHaEQbx69WHBP2sA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Plank is my favorite happy hour & I need something discounted here to not spend my whole check!  The oysters are so delish and I was worried being in Nebraska.   The house sauce(s) they have come with them, which I totally didn't think I would want, were so complimentary to the oysters.  *~*Heaven*~*And, OMG, the Mainsail Limoncello - literally I don't know how anyone could EVER have just one!  This combo = 1 very happy (maybe a lil tipsy) girl!Our server was PERFECT for us & appreciated how excited we were w/ our food & drinks...made excellent recommendations based on what we were liking.  Wish we could get him every time!"}, {"review_id": "iNAJ1kjXR0yA_qjlpecYzA", "user_id": "lPNxg0oIDnQ4fRMQScgT2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I was seated kindly and even was given the opportunity to change to actually further in the restaurant. I don't like sitting at the first two tables especially since it was vertically empty by the windows and I was early! I soon ordered clam chowder- excellent, Chardonnay(Lodi) - above average cold and crisp and was a great partner to the oysters ( surprised by how grainy on was but it reminded me of being at the seashore so hey, one down and a swig and I was ready to try the second, much better!

The restaurant is located in a nice trendy part of town. The inside is classy and open, and the service is friendly and fast. Food-wise, they mostly specialize in creole and French-style seafood (aka cooked with heavy sauces) - but I was in the mood for something lighter, so I just got the simple grilled grouper, which was delicious. They also have a promo with Yelp, where you get 3 free oysters if you check in. Really the only issue I had with the restaurant was that they played explicit rap music on the radio - which I felt was distracting and inappropriate, and that's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Check it out if you're in the mood for seafood, but perhaps don't bring your kids (or maybe just come earlier in the day)."}, {"review_id": "iZMetRu27YY49lOO9nr6Aw", "user_id": "xIWnTwR7yA9MzlDBFX5bgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Such a cute place!

I'm visiting Omaha for a wellness conference and I only had about 40 minutes to spare for lunch. I desperately wanted to dine outdoors and soak up some sunlight before going back into the cold, dark hotel for the conference. I came upon Plank, which is located a few short blocks away from the Embassy Suites, with it's welcoming patio shaded by umbrellas and enclosed with beautiful flower-filled railing planters. I was seated right away and my pleasant waitress greeted me with ice water.A habit of mine is to ask the waitress for recommendations on their menu. She immediately smiled and mentioned the blackened catfish as her favorite dish. Sold!My entree arrived quite quickly and piping hot, worthy of a Yelp pic. I was surprised to see the succulent crawfish top the cajun sauce and after one bite, I knew this dish was special. It kinda reminded me of home - one of my favorite seafood dishes at Busboy and Poets in DC. The dirty rice, cajun sauce, crisp green beans and catfish were a perfect combination. I enjoyed every single bite.The service was superb -- so much so that I brought my boyfriend back for dinner the SAME NIGHT! We started with the beignet hush puppies with jalapeño jam (OMG!), spiced peel and eat shrimp and oysters rockefeller. After learning they were sold out of the fried seafood combo, I talked my bf into the catfish I had earlier in the day and I had the simply grilled blackened scallops with veggies. Everything was exceptionally delicious!Too bad that was our last day in Omaha or else we would have visited again. With such a vast menu, I'm sure we would have enjoyed another great meal."}, {"review_id": "kciQ1XLM0aHSR1Y3VPhaKg", "user_id": "Kb8wevJyirmA-ZrdJLNygA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Plank is one of my favorite places in Omaha, it never seems to disappoint. they always provide great food, fast service and good wine. The reason I gave it a four star instead of five this time around is just due to one small menu change. I have a tradition of always getting the salmon crostini upon my visits. This time, like always I ordered the crostini, but when I received it I noticed that they just recently started making it differently. Instead of individually making each piece of the appetizer they had all the toppings in a ball surrounded by the crostini bread you can put it on. It still tasted good but i noticed it didn't seem to have all the same ingredients and was just not quite as amazing. Which for me was just a tad disappointing because that is the item i regularly ordered. But overall, still a satisfying experience as always"}, {"review_id": "wEwvMDFcQHHtv4aXcMA1hQ", "user_id": "w2QxIeGXkA4RoJMsdV9yuw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Better than Applebee's but not especially remarkable seafood.  The tomatoes on the Greek salad weren't ripe.   The Peel and eat shrimp weren't fresh and the texture was mealy.  The fish in the fish and hops was really oily and the fries were undercooked.  Very cool decor though!"}, {"review_id": "fyj1tDrJZk0HeW1KeheK3Q", "user_id": "Jfqy-1RuNpYgABqG8mYWVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "I've come to Plank a few times.

I had the albacore sliders and fries and THE jalapeño jelly. If you get the sliders definitely ask for they jelly! No regrets there at all! Oh I also got the oyster shooter.

We each started with an oyster shooter (not necessarily my thing, but when it's your 30th birthday...why not!) and we each got one of their cocktails. I had the Red Beard 'Rita and my fiancé had the Captain's Daughter Spiked Lemonade. Both had the perfect combination of sweetness and alcohol. We also got the calamari appetizer and it was SO good, especially with the zucchini chips that were mixed in.
