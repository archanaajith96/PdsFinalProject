Huge pastry shop with homemade desserts- I tried 3 different cannolis, each of which are made to order (you can pick the fillings, toppings, and type of shell). You can actually even order mini cannolis (great idea if you want to try them all). We were able to grab a table when we went and dine-in. Service was a little slow, I had to get up and locate the waitress 3X- the first to tell her she forgot one of our desserts, and the other 2 to ask for water. No one was dining in or waiting in line, so not sure why the service was so poor.Tip: go at night (after dinner time) to avoid the longggggg line!!! Also, don't forget cash (no credit cards allowed)."}, {"review_id": "rCQjj2hnqNJJMG-KUwdC8Q", "user_id": "bVRwy8knBJkhBiSlffFzXA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "3.5 stars - I came here with my sister, who believes that the cannoli here is superior to Mike's Pastry. The line was massive going into this place for takeout, so we decided to dine-in. It was one of the worst dine-in experiences I've had with subpar customer service. We had to ask the waitress if we could seat ourselves since no one was at the front, ask her for the menus since she forgot to hand us some, and take our check to the cashier since she never came to collect it. The only 'service' she provided was bringing our food. We ordered a chocolate dipped cannoli with chocolate chips and a tiramisu. The cannoli was just okay - it was just a tad too sweet for my liking, but I can see why people enjoy it if they prefer really sweet desserts. The tiramisu was much more to my liking - the cocoa powder offset the sweetness of the custard/cake. Terrible service; skip dining-in and just wait in the line for ordering to-go."}, {"review_id": "u7uHLokwV7VAy1JveH0loQ", "user_id": "tNq35k92WAkSLSqeof03hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Mike's Pastry and Modern Pastry are the two popular bakeries in Little Italy. Depending on who you ask, they may pick Modern Pastry over Mike's Pastry for cannolis. Regardless, both places are awesome for cannolis. Modern Pastry has key advantages in regards to quality and consistency. First, each cannoli is made to order. You can pick the filling, shell, and toppings. Next, there are less flavors so the chances of a dud flavor go down. Personally, I prefer the many flavors at Mike's and they are bigger. Nonetheless, you cannot go wrong with Modern Pastry. Lines can be long at both spots.If you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary.

Modern Pastry Shop is currently the second most reviewed after Mike's Pastry for cannoli. During my trip here, my friends and I decide to do a mini cannoli tour. In my opinion, it is better than popular Mike's! Modern prides on filling the cannoli shell as you order and you get to customize what toppings you want on it. This is a fresh idea! The cannoli filling is much more flavorful and has a nice whip to it.

It was bustling with people, presumably most were tourists. There was a great variety of beautiful pastries such as the oversized chocolate eclair and the huge cream puff and there were also chocolate truffles that looked rich and decadent. It's no wonder this place has so many people waiting in line even at 10pm at night. I only tried the chocolate mousse and cannot comment on the other pastries. The mousse part of the pastry was silky smooth and chocolatey. The crust part of the pastry had good texture, but there was a greasy taste to it.  It could be the type of shortening used because i've tasted this in another bakery before.   Not a fan of this greasy taste."}, {"review_id": "D_EgDFaYuoSiqjM0YB_r4A", "user_id": "X6WJRvwyY4gMJ3lhXm9TJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Dear Modern Pastry, You have ruined me for life. Never again will I be satisfied with one of those run of the mill, pre-filled cannolis you find out and about in regular stores. Now that I've sampled the crème de la crème of cannolis, I am absolutely ruined.Your chocolate covered cannoli shell with a traditional ricotta filling, dipped in pistachios quite literally plagues my nights from 3,000 miles away, leaving me to wonder why I left Boston for sunny California. Why, oh why, have you done this to me? In the middle of a particularly grueling work day, I find myself having sinfully gluttonous daydreams about your beautifully layered rainbow cookies and heavenly triple chocolate cake.

I ordered the mini size, which was perfect for a snack while walking around the neighborhood. I went for an original ricotta filling with pistachios, no powdered sugar, and I have to tell you, that was the best little scrumptious snack wrapped in a cute little box.

I had previously never been a fan of the cannoli, because I had only ever tried one once from an Italian chain restaurant a decade ago and it was terrible. But for the sake of being in Boston, I decided to give it a shot.I first tried a cannoli from Mike's and thought it was pretty good, but then I came here and was blown away. The ricotta filling is amazing and I don't need anything else on it (although a bit of powdered sugar doesn't hurt). The cannolis here are a little smaller than Mike's and there isn't nearly as much variety in flavors and toppings, but I think the size is perfect and the shell has a better consistency. Plus they're made to order, which just means that they only fill the shells and add the toppings after you order.If you have the time, you can try to get seating. There are only a few tables, so it can take a while if there's a line. Or you can order to go and they'll neatly package your treats. There are a decent number of non-cannoli options in the cases. I had the cream puff, which I thought was alright.

FANTASTIC CANNOLIS & ITALIAN PASTRIES THAT ARE DELICIOUSSSSSSSS!!!!  IT IS ALWAYS SUPER BUSY WITH BIG LINES  IN HERE! THEY ARE FAMOUS FOR THEIR CLASSIC RICOTTA CANNOLIS,  COOKIES, RUM CAKES & THEIR INDIVIDUAL PASTRIES. This store is located in the Historic North End of Boston. This store accepts Cash Only! Their other store is in Medford  & is smaller & more relaxed. They have 2 floors at this location ( Downstairs is For Sports) & a separate next door as well. They also have Cappuccino & different  kinds of Italian coffee!  You can get them to go or sit down @ the tables & have your pastries.            Now you can't mention Modern without mentioning  their competition across the street Mike's Pastry. Instead of competing these 2 bakeries just bring in more people to The North End Boston to try their desserts. Are you a Mike's or a Modern people will ask? People take sides like it's The Super Bowl.  It's hysterical how loyal people are to their bakeries. Actually both are EXCELLENT SOME THINGS ARE BETTER @ MIKES & SOME THINGS ARE BETTER @ MODERN! You'll have to try both & see what team you are on! LOL!  It used to be, you had to have mega bucks & be really rich to have the Good Life, not anymore. The Game has changed. You've been Upgraded.

I'm not going to take sides here but I will say that Modern is excellent.I saw quite a few options here for desserts. So many in fact that I was a bit overwhelmed with the choices. Do I get the delicious looking carrot cake? What's a \"Paragina\" because that looks awesome. In the end, the mildly drunk local in front of me convinced me to go with a canoli and so that's what I did.Back at home, I unwrapped it from the box and took my first bite. The canoli shell was quite hard and tasty by itself. Each end dipped just a bit in chocolate. Yum. The filling I chose was the vanilla custard. Tasty and not too sweet, it's almost like the filling of Dunkin's Boston Kreme donut. Very enjoyable and one is enough to satisfy.The queue here is much better organized than the crush that seems to happen at Mike's.

It is extremely popular with tourists but it seems to have kept its 'old world' Italian ambiance. This is one of those places where the line for take away can go out the door and around the block, especially in the summer. We went in January and there were few tourists.We sat at one of the six or so tables and had cappuccino and Italian pastries. My wife had a pistachio cannoli and I had a chocolate biscotti. They offer just about any type of Italian pastry dessert if you don't care for those two. I can honestly say that everything is good here. Their cappuccino is excellent, just like what I used to get at a typical cafe in Milan, Italy. They only take cash but there is a Citizens Bank a few short blocks up Hannover Street. The North End has changed over years. I may be showing my age but I recall seeing Alfa Romeos and Fiats double parked while their owners stopped for coffee or even dinner. Ducati motorcycles with young Italian men in black leather jackets and their girlfriends in leopard print tights holding on for dear life roaring down Hannover St. Then a red Ferrari would appear. You could hear those from a mile away. Old Italian men would sit at outdoor tables drinking coffee, smoking, and conversing in Italian. You don't see much of that anymore.
