It's on the smaller side which isn't a big deal, but maybe not best for larger groups. There was 6 of us and we were crammed at a table. My chair was wobbly and felt like it might come apart at any moment. They've either changed all of their menus or this location just doesn't have all that the other ones do. They lack some of the non-seafood options which is unfortunate considering there aren't that many to begin with. I get it, it's a seafood place but it's nice when you can accommodate everyone. There was a hair in my water. Mine and my husband's food came out after everyone else at the table was finished eating. I ordered the chicken sandwich and there was a giant piece of chicken on the first half but when I got to the second half there was no chicken at all - and I didn't realize it until it was too late. So whoever finally sent my food out cut it in half but the chicken wasn't split between the two half's. Cajun fries were over seasoned. Those who had seafood said it was greasy. Probably wouldn't return."}, {"review_id": "Y1k_kvDfzpo_aKAF-uPnWg", "user_id": "io3JoPj05TGtuaBCB-u-6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Still prefer Boiling Crab, but this is the next best thing for this area.Despite waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes, even though it was Valentine's Day, the food over there was good. Thankfully.Order a pound of mussels, 2 lb of shrimp, everything in the trifecta seasoning, number 4 spicy.Had some corn, potato, and sausage, and rice on the side.Tons of lime used for this, as number 4 spicy is really spicy. The spicy level does go up to number 6, which I'm guessing would be way too spicy. I would have been fine with the number three spicy for a enjoyable meal. Number 4 is probably the most I would tolerate for spiciness but less enjoyable due to the spicy but still edible at the same time, but you will need a lot of lime And water. In terms of the flavor, the trifecta is pretty good. But definitely still preferred The Boiling Crab everything seasoning as there's more spices or, I don't know how to describe it, there's just more pieces of flavor in their sauce and less over here. Shrimp was good. I would definitely not order the mussels again as it was just wasn't that good. Even the sauce that the mussels was in, which was supposed to be Trifecta, but just felt a little bit more dried. Not sure exactly why.Overall cost wasn't too expensive I think the total came out to around $40. Pretty good server and waitress. They do take a bit longer in terms of seating people down. But they do have a phone messaging / online time counter. Which was nice. But some tables took forever to be clean which delayed the service for everybody. And apparently you can make reservation as well, so maybe try that next time.I would definitely come back here for my Boiling Crab craving. Just make a reservation."}, {"review_id": "TnAgkGGbEnUQjLNZSG0j5A", "user_id": "uMMbdmgH6hiBSjeL2b4E_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Great place for Cajun style seafood, can be pricey but is worth it.

Last week my family and a group of friends decided to go to Angry Crab in Phoenix. The host said the wait was an hour long because they were low on servers. We said okay and waited. While waiting I decided to get a couple of beers. I asked the bartender for two micheladas. She started by filling the cups with ice. I asked her to make them like they do in their Mesa location without ice. She gave me the biggest attitude but said she would make them no ice. She then served me two of the worst beers I've ever had in my life. One beer was 2/3 full. I'll post a picture."}, {"review_id": "zk80Rf43xhacImryehmGgA", "user_id": "bYzLZxneUNSUgMfooHlxiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/25/2017", "text": "For starters, how can you go wrong with seafood.

Their service in both times was flawless. We ordered what we have made our usual at similar restaurants, shrimps usually with a tri/3 combination sauce, corn, a fish basket that usually comes with fries and drinks. Every once in a while, we may order an appetizer which is usually fried calamari. Ordering was easy. We were asked if it was our first time and on our first time, our waitress explained the menu to us. The food came out very quickly, we were impressed with the speed. The food tasted very good. I would have loved to give this place 5 stars but honestly, having tried a similar restaurant in the valley about 4-5 times, I still think they remain my favorite. What is different? It's the sauce and flavor. The first time, our food had way too much butter for my liking. The shrimps did not absorb the flavor enough so they felt bland. The second time I asked for less butter. The shrimps came out dryer yes but then again, they were bland even though I chose medium for my heat level. I think it would be great if they would consider increasing the garlic especially in their tri-fecta sauce. It has the potential to be superb, it's just more on the bland side if you ask me. Also, I think the food can use some more salt. One thing about sea food in general, if you don't salt it well, it loses its flavor. I still would say the place deserves my 4 stars and I would not at all discourage any one from going there but I have already established my favorite restaurant early on I guess."}, {"review_id": "Z1R-QfpUNGGSFxaqVqeH3Q", "user_id": "xRR6PCqxPrsXzigCbSx7VQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "**WARNING LONG REVIEW**It was my birthday yesterday. A few friends have raved about this establishment. With my husband & son HUGE seafood fanatics, I chose this place to celebrate my birthday with my family. The wait wasn't too bad for how busy they were. We were seated at our table: which was originally a table for 4...but we'll get to that later.  Upon getting situated we were semi-promptly greeted by Taylor. Side note: kuddos to Taylor for being able to write her name upside down on the paper that lined our booth's table. She took our drink orders. Promptly returned with two beers & a Sprite for my son. Asked if we were ready to order. Mind you, my husband & I worked all day & were not afforded the opportunity to eat much, as we were quite busy.  We asked for a recommendation on an appetizer or where they fell into the \"flow\" of the menu. She sighed, looked to her right then with the tip of her pen, dabbed the middle of the menu. She half heartedly recommended the clams or calamari. Choosing the latter, we waited. She came back roughly 3 minutes later to see if we were ready to place our order. We made mention, again that this was our first time here. She quickly snapped off w/a \"OK, I'll give you a few more minutes\" walking away without ANY advice. Upon her arrival with our appetizer, I loudly said her name as she tried to briskly drop the basket & leave. She turned around & I explained to her that this was our first time here & completely unknowing w/how this establishment works. She briefly described the rundown. We enjoyed our appetizer & as a family; figured out what we'd be ordering for our main course. We waited...& waited...drinks empty....appetizer completed....WE WAITED. All the while, Taylor seemed to feel as though her sidework took precedence. I finally was able to catch her attention after shouting her name as she blindingly strolled passed us. She turned around & took our order. Then briskly moved on w/o offering a refill to my son's drink or offer my husband & I another beer. As those frosted white solo cups are quite see through. 20ish minutes later, a super sweet gentleman came over to start delivering our dinner. Please keep in mind: we ordered 2 pounds of king crab, 1 lobster, 2 pounds of headless shrimp, 1 pound of snow crab, potatoes & sausage. This is easily a $200+ bill. Bag after bag, he delivered. He even completed our requested refills & brought them over to our table. I reached into my purse & tipped the gentleman who so willingly & promptly helped us. He said he couldn't take it, but I insisted. I made mention that in the last 15 minutes, he's been more helpful than Taylor was in the last hour. We had one bag left. (The lobster) as they take longer. Enjoying our dinner & having a great family night out, my husband looked over & took notice that the kind gentleman that was so proficient in ensuring we were taken care of; was addressing the one & only: TAYLOR.  Unbeknownst to me, I tipped the MANAGER ‍ Well, wouldn't you know it, Taylor took note & was literally suctioned to our booth. As appreciated as it was to see a strong backbone from the management staff, it was already a little too late as we literally had everything we needed. To say it was overkill is an understatement. My brother finally got off work & joined us. While all in all it was a great night spent with my family, We probably will not be returning simply due to the fact that if you're anticipating a $300 bill with a tip....you'd think the service would be a little better or they'd hire more competent staff."}, {"review_id": "nD8v_6r6QmWEV0ZdvS_5aw", "user_id": "xe9mhnlofGpXmFP1L5yrCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/31/2017", "text": "They have a pretty good selection and the food is good.
