The food is also very good!!If you are not used to having Indian food on a regular basis, you will likely think theirs is absolutely amazingly flavorful and worth the $$. As someone who has had Indian food throughout my life, I would say I am usually more critical of Indian restaurants so would have to say that the food was great, but not like \"omg the best Indian food ever\" as many seem to be claiming. For the prices, I was honestly expecting more... either in flavor or portion. Don't get me wrong, the food is excellent but I just think the menu is a bit pricy for decent Indian food. Makes sense for this location to have such prices though due to the clientele in this busy central downtown area. I also was a bit disappointed that Rasika has no happy hour! Overall, great place and nice decor! Will likely be back."}, {"review_id": "CuKV-O-mriMR5C16MO6cxA", "user_id": "Htx0bjQtOsoEIVBoSbjh5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Something happened to our 5:00 reservation.

Glad we could do this, it was a great meal!We started with Papadum and three fine chutney. More cracker-like, but still good. The roasted Mango shrimp followed, served with a mint chutney these had a subtle heat that was enjoyable. The Sali Boti featured tender chunks of lamb and slices of apricot with potato straws atop. My dining companion enjoyed the Tandori Salmon. As always, Gulub Jama makes a great dessert, this time along side Tamarind ice cream.This version of Indian cuisine is definitely more contemporary than most. This progressive approach delivers a great variety. It also drives attendance. Yes, you've had classic Indian cuisine, but have you had Rasika's? The answer to that question should be, \"yes\" to everyone!"}, {"review_id": "DPn0J7LPAcl76k1TDCp_Bw", "user_id": "p6RurvWCPEqR8PP4siwiVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Ah Rasika, what can I say that has not been said before?

HIGHLY recommend for celebrating a special occasion or even to just have a nice meal out.Some highlights:-Palak Chaat - absolutely DELICIOUS. possibly the best vegetarian dish I've ever had in my life! a must-order as an appetizer.-Mumbai Manhattan - If you're a whiskey drinker, give this a try. Great tasting drink and the cherry infused with whiskey at the end is a nice little sweet bite to finish the meal on.-Truffle Naan - actually a little underwhelming.. saw the word \"truffle\" and got super excited about what it would taste like, but only tasted butter and cheese. The naan itself is still really good & fresh, but just don't expect anything too special from the truffle.Lastly I want to shout-out our awesome server, Esteban, who was so friendly from the moment we got seated. He came by several times to check on us and ask how we were enjoying the dishes without it being overbearing. We came in on my girlfriend's birthday and he brought out a complimentary dessert and genuinely sang happy birthday to her with me. An overall great experience & will be back!"}, {"review_id": "0MKZkJ5f_4SQS0Cb-ha-cQ", "user_id": "B95OT0Pkc8PTFm8pCtXq1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Yaaaas, a DC restaurant that lives up to its hype. I got extremely lucky and was able to make a weekend lunch reservation here only two weeks ahead of time. They're usually closed on Sundays, but was open this past Sunday for Easter, so I quickly snagged a reservation on Open Table.This location in Chinatown easily accessible via metro, easy to find, and had plenty of street parking on a Sunday. The wait staff are all extremely friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and more than willing to make recommendations for you.Let's start with drinks, I ordered the green chili gin and my friend ordered the cucumber gin refresher. Both were delicious and highly recommended if you're a gin lover. The flavors were subtle, but really showed, and did not mask the taste of the gin. Plus, I love drinks with egg white. My other friend ordered the mango lassi and thought it was a little sour, but I tried it and thought it was perfect. If you normally eat plain yogurt, you'd enjoy it.Next, we ordered 3 appetizers to share. We had the palak chaat, their signature crispy spinach, which was definitely my favorite and a must order! We also had the spicy reshmi kabob, which is minced chicken with mint, coriander and green chili. This was probably the spiciest dish we ordered, but my one friend who can only tolerate a little bit of spicy really enjoyed it too. Loved the mint chutney it came with too. Lastly, we had the calamari. I didn't like this as much and probably wouldn't order it again. The texture and flavor weren't very exciting.For my main, I got the duck vindaloo. I looooved it. I'm a huge fan of duck and it was cooked perfectly! It was meaty, but leaner than beef. Duck is the perfect red meat. The sauce was really flavorful, but not really spicy. It was a bit more tangy and tomato flavored than I've had before, but still really enjoyed it. It came with coconut rice. I would definitely order this again. I also got garlic naan to eat with my vindaloo and have no regrets.My friends got the tikka masala and goat biryani and both enjoyed it. All of the meat for the goat biryanis is buried at the bottom. The biryani also came with a huge bowl of yogurt sauce that we all ended up sharing and eating with our naan.For dessert, I got the pista kulfi. It's a pistachio Indian ice cream on a popsicle stick. I don't really enjoy sweets, so this is what the waiter suggested. I didn't really like it. It didn't have much flavor to me, it wasn't really even sweet, but was still somehow cloying? I only ate about half of it and then I gave it to my dessert loving friend. The carrot dessert with cardamom ice cream was really good though. The other dessert that came with the crispy noodles was probably our favorite - don't remember the name though.I had an alcoholic drink, an entree, a dessert, an order of naan and we split 3 appetizers 4 ways, which came out to about $70/person. Not too bad, but still pricey for an everyday affair. Would definitely recommend coming here for a birthday or special occasion."}, {"review_id": "jqPDggKnQsp9e1jqrq2Pbg", "user_id": "NmdKCZlUVJGnqDxhXl2ofw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "YUMMMMM!!!! Usually Indian food feels very heavy to me, but this place managed to keep all the wonderful spices and make the food feel SO LIGHT AND AIRY!grabbed the gin fizz (can't go wrong w egg white), + MUST GET black cod (two pieces over a bed of vermicelli) SO BUTTERY AND SMOOTH+ MUST GET truffle naan (WOW, so simple but truffle over naan is revolutionary!!!!)+ MUST GET palak chaat (fried spinach) so amazing, light and airy! pro tip/ you can order half order as well+ also got the chicken masala, and while i thought it and as great i didn't LOVE IT as much as all the other dishes. + thought the cardamom ice cream was unique but not a \"must get\". got it w the apple beignets and felt it was a bit too sweet.  So glad I was able to snag a seat without wait (came in at 6pm in a Monday) but recommend making reservations beforehand if you have the chance. High end restaurant w open kitchen and beautiful decorations. Great drinks (tho on the more expensive side) w smaller portions. Been here twice and both times Came out to $52 for the whole meal (yikes!!!!), but I left very full.

Therefore getting this reservation seemed impossible. We weren't able to get reservations but we kept checking as the days went by and we finally got a reservation! Typically this place doesn't open on sundays but on holiday weekends they do. It's a pretty fancy Indian restaurant, so you do have to dress up a little. But the inside was gorgeous and service was on the money. As appetizer, we ordered the palak chaat. It had crispy baby spinach, yogurt, tamarind, and date. It sounds strange because of the date ingredient, but seriously trust me. It's sooooo good. You'll thank me later for it. For entree, I ordered the malai palak which is a spinach dish that has garlic and cumin in it. My bf got the chicken tikka masala. And both were mind blowingly good. At an Indian restaurant, if you aren't sure what to order and you eat meat, ordering chicken tikka masala is a safe choice cause it's creamy and all the spices just work so well together.

In fact, President Obama went to Rasika West End (that's the other Rasika location) for his birthday dinners ... not once, but twice (August 2013 and August 2017). Rasika also has a sister restaurant called Bombay Club (run by the same owner).The atmosphere is pretty classy, but you can still get by if you have a nice pair of jeans. I RSVP'ed a spot using the OpenTable without any problems and I was able to easily find an ideal lunch time two weeks prior to our arrival. I was a bit overwhelmed with their a la carte menu (40+ combined items - from seafood, vegetarian, meat, clay oven, tawa [aka griddle], sigri [aka barbecue], etc.), but I did notice a pre-theatre menu on the back of the menu ($35 for limited options of one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert - available at dinner till 6:30 PM) as well as Four / Six Course Tasting Menus.***Garlic Naan with Herbs ($3.50): Hot hot hot! Naan was fresh out of the oven and I can eat naan without any dipping sauce. but this dish tasted even better after I dipped naan into the tikka masala sauce. It was so good that our table got 2nd order of garlic naan.Chicken Tikka Masala (Tomato / Ginger / Green Chili - $17): Incredibly tasty and creamy sauce and hands down the best chicken tikka masala I have ever had. Sauce had complex and subtle flavors with a hint of herbs - not to mention that the sauce also tasted slightly spicy.Palak Chaat (Crispy baby spinach / sweet yogurt tamarind / date chutney - $12): Baby spinach had a crispy texture with a hint of creaminess from yogurt as well as a strong zesty aftertaste. What a perfect combination!Gulab Jamun, Cardamom Ice Cream ($10): Desert took a while to come out. I actually didn't like gulab jamuns too much because they were soaked in syrup, but both tasted slightly warm. Cardamom ice cream had a smooth texture and a citrus aftertaste. The ice cream was so cold that my teeth started to hurt.***This is not your ordinary Indian restaurant and it was one amazing dish after another - even my friend who typically does not like Indian food finished his entire chicken tikka masala.

This is by far the best option in DC. Great ambiance. Great service. Great quality. Very reasonable prices. Most entrees, while not overly heavy on the portions, are $25 or less. First thing's first: make a reservation. My friend and I just happened to be lucky to get a table on a Tuesday night around 7:00. Leaving wanting more, I went back for lunch before heading out of town. The second time around, I ordered the Hyderabadi Lamb Biryani and wished I hadn't. It was good, but not as good as the Lamb Kadai I had for dinner. I was tempted to get the Chicken Tikka Masala, which my co-worker had ordered for dinner, but it's just as hard to get lamb where I live now as it is Indian. For dessert, you cannot go wrong with either the Gulab Jamun (cardamom ice cream) or the Pista Kulfi (pistachio ice cream), however, you can go wrong if you don't order both. Overall, both times, I left feeling like I ate a lot, yet I didn't feel gross.

You may be tempted to order other apps, but you will be disappointed that you didn't just order multiple orders of the palak chaat. The spinach is crispy, but not greasy, with a bit of sweet and savory. Really well executed dish!Black cod: this fish is really well prepared.
