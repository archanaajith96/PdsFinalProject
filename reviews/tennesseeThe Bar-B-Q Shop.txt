It was all right. Full disclosure - I chose The Bar-B-Q Shop for a dinner when my husband and I were in Memphis visiting his brother a couple of weekends ago JUST because I wanted to eat BBQ spaghetti at a restaurant claiming to be the originator of BBQ spaghetti. We started with BBQ Nachos, which were just really a miss for me. We got them with the pulled pork (you can also do chicken breast or beef), and the pulled pork was fine. But when you're making nachos, all the components matter. The queso matters and any other topping matters (beans? pico? pickled veg?). These nachos were a gimmick and I had a bite and that was enough for me. The BBQ spaghetti made me giggle. It's definitely a gimmick as well, but one that made me feel like a kid again (what kid didn't want to mix their favorite foods together?)! It was fun, but I hesitate to say it was good or that I would order it again. I would recommend it as a side rather than as a full plate for sure. All in all, this was an a-okay place to eat, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go here if you're visiting Memphis!"}, {"review_id": "9__ME7dRS337jTuey8qWpg", "user_id": "jonAA-fWgAkWq0LhsEPd5A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "While down here for the holidays, we were on a mission to try all the best BBQ in town. Unfortunately this place didnt cut it for me. The pulled pork was very dry and I had to dump extra sauce on it to make it more palatable. There is better bbq like Central in town. I heard the ribs here are good, however I can't comment on them since we never ordered them. This place was very full on the weekend at noon, so plan ahead.

I, not being a meat lover or much of a bbq fan, had my expectations low but knew he would be happy. Well I was very pleasantly surprised! Both the rib tips he ordered and the array of sides I ordered were all delicious! The service was great and very informative for a first time visitor. I was the only one not full on ribs and spaghetti- so I had dessert! This was the best cheesecake I have ever had ! It was chocolate cheesecake and not heavy at all. I can't raid they said it was homemade or not.

Both the front and the back entrance have their charm. The service here was great, the waitress gave us honest recommendations and we were not disappointed. I had the half and half, thus including the bbq spaghetti, which was amazing. I just would have liked to have more of their sauce as it was delicious! One of us also got the ribs which were impeccable. Only one of us was slightly disappointed, as she ordered chicken which apparently wasn't that great.

I've been here countless times and apparently have never done a review. This is my favorite BBQ in Memphis. I love their ribs and their BBQ sandwiches and BBQ nachos.

The food is very good here, not the best ribs in town, but very good. I absolutely adored the barbecue spaghetti though. Their pulled pork with sauce over pasta is a dream come true for your tastebuds. Service is friendly, restrooms are clean, the place is way bigger than you think when you walk in. Oh, and the sides are quite good as well. A definite must in Memphis to add to your barbecue comparison."}, {"review_id": "3Q9SgMBZ713NyQxiHEEQMw", "user_id": "xiVqyOFvcs6fuzRrLq3Npg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "I've never had barbecue spaghetti, until today, and it sure is delicious. The vibe is great. The colors are so warm and welcoming. I love the antique metal ceiling. And the staff gives you a warm and welcoming feeling. You can order your barbecue, Sauced or dry. They sell all of their rubs in the local stores. Anthony Bourdain (spelling) came here on one of his episodes. This is a famous Memphis spot.  You will not be disappointed. Succulent and delicious.

Came in the middle of the afternoon on a Thursday and it was not busy at all. One plate of rib tips was left and we got them half dry half glazed. The dry rub is a really nice mix of spices. I tasted it straight and immediately thought how yummy that would be on popcorn. The meat was tender but not mushy, flavorful but not over seasoned. l prefer the dry but hubby liked the glazed just as much. Got 3 sides, potato salad, slaw, and greens. All were well prepared and balanced. Also had the combo appetizer with seared Bologna, Polish sausage, cheese, peppers and crackers was the perfect accompaniment to a cold beer, especially with a little dip in the super spicy sauce. The crispy black sear on the meats is soooooo good. Just wish there were some pickles and onions to eat along with. Overall, I'm so glad we stopped here.

And it is tasty, but there's nothing like dining there in person.On a Saturday night, the five of us were promptly seated. Food came out quickly and was DIVINE. This was the Bar-B-Q Shop at its best. Ribs were fall off the bone tender, onion rings, fries, and coleslaw were big hits (especially the coleslaw, which remains simply the best I've ever had), and my chopped pork was delicious. And of course, their Texas toast has no equal -- who knew cheap white bread could be made so delicious so simply?Including a starter cheese and sausage basket, the total for our table was $100, which seems quite reasonable for all the wonderful food we had. I stand by my assessment that this is simply the best barbecue in Memphis.
