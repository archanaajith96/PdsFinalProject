Each time I go there, I always feel welcome & the owners are always nice! I'm not a fan that this is a self-serving restaurant, which makes it feel like a fast food dining area but the food quickly make you forget about it! Of course, each Korean restaurant has their own way of making their specialty. I'm in love with the west coast taste of Korean food but for a little town in Fayetteville, this will quench and satisfy your craving for Korean cuisine! Definitely my comfort food.*I also highly recommend their Deep Fried Avocado. Makes me come back each time for it specifically."}, {"review_id": "62NWUKUk_L84metA9Awk0A", "user_id": "78RgX1cE727Wc7qGYulbCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Really good and authentic Korean food. The bulgolgi is delicious and comes on a big fajita-style plate. Every meal gets miso soup and kimchi bites as an appetizer. I highly recommend the sushi appetizer. It was a plate of giant sashimi and sushi filets, including shrimp, eal, tuna, and yellowtail. I wish I had gotten more sushi. The place is very casual, counter order, and the conditions are a bit dirty. But the food is worth it! Consider getting it to-go. Prices are 12+ per plate, so not super cheap but you could easily split an entree to save money."}, {"review_id": "wPgxpX87GX7ETNqHPHqkLw", "user_id": "aq6ITbFDrR-lbBk3yCd94g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "Lunch for 2.Firstly, I was REALLY disappointed that this place wasn't a traditional Korean BBQ restaurant where you can grill on the table. It was a walk up and order, fast-casual spot. We didn't get any sushi, but did get bibimbap and other Korean dishes. It was just meh, not very memorable honestly. I'm probably not gonna stop by here again for Korean food. Sushi?

It is like a fast food style restaurant where you order at the counter then they bring the food out to you. When we ordered we were told that it would be about 30 mins for the Korean food, or anything other than sushi. I was really appreciative of this because then we at least knew what wait time we were signing up for. We stayed to try it regardless of the time. All meals come with the small dish apps and miso soup. In addition, they brought us out fried dumplings as on the house app since the wait was so long. In reality though, I had my hot meal in front of me after only 20 minutes so they over estimated which is unusual. Plus they took care of us when they thought the wait would be long which was awesome! I ordered the dolsot bimibob so it came in the clay pot. It was really good. I'll definitely be back to try more options !!!"}, {"review_id": "5WhXUB0vS7V6lBSFgCZNZQ", "user_id": "zrZ_TjIGyyePGwCZ_lUJCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Great place to come and dine or take out.

You have to wait for the menu or stand in line to order and pay then did gets served. I did not see any grill in each tablet. We tried the usual beef bulgogi, pork bulgogi, bibimbap, dulsot bibimbap and shrimp fried rice. The come with the bon chon and miso soup. If you want extra on the side dish, you get charge extra$5 which is the first for me.

Add in that we're in NW Arkansas I'm ready to call CNN. I am here for business and annoyingly got the pang of desperation for some sushi and specifically fresh salmon. I look on Yelp and find this place. Yelp is wonderful but I often find in smaller pockets of the world it sometimes steers you in the wrong direction... I.E. finding sushi in Arkansas usually turns into a very disappointing experience. Not the case tonight. Look past the exterior and interior and the food was just good. Not only was my food good, but everyone around me had something I NEEDED to try. I might even go back tomorrow!  everyone that worked there was nice, accommodating and helpful, the tables were clean and my only complaint is that two pairs of my chopsticks splintered. Too cheap. Dinner bento box, pick 3. Gyoza, salmon roll, sushi. Surcharge for all salmon. Surcharge for fried rice. Surrrrr worth it. Not pictured: yummy ginger dressing salad."}, {"review_id": "coI13tTCz8DbVViZit9wuQ", "user_id": "TlgI6AkLasd8f4cXkK4xbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/1/2017", "text": "Love this place.  Menu is HUGE.  Sushi, Noodles, Bibimbap...  Pretty much everything you could imagine in a Korean restaurant.  We've tried lots of the options and intend to try many more.  The sushi is solid and their chef is great.  They bring out all kinds of food for you to eat with your meals.  Kimchi, pancakes, several pickled items.  It's solid.  If you like Asian food you owe yourself a trip to KJ."}, {"review_id": "GmRgTm1G_res6IANK2OZ8A", "user_id": "9QO6dh2eMsS_OS3d5jhCuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/25/2017", "text": "I have eaten at alot of sushi restuarants, over the years, This place had some of the best sushi in Arkansas, They also have plenty of Korean Dishes to choose from.

The Stuffed Avocado is lightly fried with tempura, stuffed with spicy tuna, a small chunk of cream cheese and delicious sauce. In addition, I had the KJ Roll which was good, I will be returning to try the bulgogi beef.
