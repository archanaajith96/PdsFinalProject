The mules were alright but the food was great. He got a house salad(no cheese) and I had the white chili; delicious. They also served corn-bread. His dinner was the steamboat brisket and I had a pasta dish (I don't remember the name) but the portions were good we both took some home. The server sorry I forgot her name) was great! The second time we went there today once we were seated by the host nobody came over for a least 5/7minutes - so my husband and I moved to the other side so we could get some service. The bartender came right over, which was nice after waiting for a little bit. We ordered our drinks/food and my husband got a salad again but they put cheese on it (he asked for no cheese because he's lactose intolerant) and they didn't bring any cornbread. The chili was extremely salty and then we both got the brisket this time because it was so good last time but there was hardly any bbq sauce and it wasn't even hot, just room temp. As if it had been sitting out. The service was alright. So the first time was awesome and the second time disappointing. Maybe a hit or miss!?"}, {"review_id": "MbCTVbuuiAqvaU5MvhQ2Mg", "user_id": "XxfjrHE_t4DcMsICx7sS7g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "Right off Dell Range. Can't miss it. Has a parking lot with easy parking. Inside, the place doesn't look bad, but doesn't look good either. Just Meh....they need to update the look.Ordered some wings and beer. Beer was good but the flavors of the wings sauces all tasted the same, like they used the same base and just added a pinch of this or a dash of that. The wings also tasted dry.Oh, and when I went to their web site, it tried to convince me to download some bloatware claiming it was for the \"security of the site\". Yeah, I'm sure the site needs lots of securing."}, {"review_id": "nd9GaEZGyfL-fnxUWYa6Gg", "user_id": "U5j_1PPc1D49YRg2AgclbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "This is everything I could want in a smokehouse. Our waiter was attentive, thorough, and very knowledgeable. Our gluten-free, dairy-free travel companion was able to eat just about anything on the menu - however, they do not have gluten free buns for sandwiches and burgers. EVERY drink on the menu is half off during happy hour. They offer free cornbread as an appetizer; these are a little dry but the very flavorful and come with honey butter. I ordered the Pokie sandwich. This is pulled pork and pepper jack mac&cheese between two slices of sourdough, dipped in cristo batter and deep fried to heavenly perfection. By the description I knew it would be good but it was waaaaaay better than I even expected! It comes with three dipping sauces: BBQ, smokehouse chipotle ranch, and raspberry jalapeño. I could not settle in which was the best dip because all of them are so full of flavor and and original! My husband ordered the Big Daddy Bloody Mary and the Troubadour MAC (pepper jack Mac mixed with seafood). If you like spicy seafood and meaty cheese, this is the perfect meal for you! The Bloody Mary is overflowing with goodies - spicy kielbasa, stuffed olives, and a cheeseburger just to make a few! Check the photos for pictures. The add-ons and the Bloody Mary mix were  delicious. And YES, it is half off I'm happy hour. However, he did say he would order it with less ice because it becomes watered down very quickly. The prices really vary. Steaks and entrees are $15 and up. Sandwiches, burgers, and other BBQ are $15 and down. This is a great spot for lunch, supper, or half-off apps and drinks."}, {"review_id": "dnLz5Z5m7SvZAg5zXiTaLg", "user_id": "2MPsYgWLcOKpi6U4mLRMdA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "Wish we'd gone to Texas Roadhouse. Prices were high, service was slow and staff was not professional. If servers could concentrate on their customers rather than hitting on eachother, maybe we would've had a better experience.

We ate dinner here after visiting Scottsbluff National Monument in Nebraska and while traveling back down to our hotel in Colorado.  I yelped, I found, we ate. We sat in the bar area though, they weren't crowded at all when we arrived at around 4-5pm.  My friend and I decided to share the loaded nachos with pulled pork, nacho cheese, and jalapenos.  YUM.  They were delish. My other friend ordered the bruschetta and it came with the tomato mixture in a big ramekin with the bread naked so you could add as much as you liked.  I thought that was a nice touch. I ordered the cobb salad with cucumbers and extra tomato.  The salad was delicious with big fresh chunks of chicken and tons of veggies.  The bacon was a bit hard but that was OK bc I wasn't planning to eat most of it anyway so I just moved it aside and concentrated on inhaling the veggies and chicken. They made me a mint sweet tea at the bar and it was DELISH!  Our server was a sweetheart and took good care of us.  Everyone was happy with their meal here - prices were reasonable and the menu was huge and had tons of things for our entire group. Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "ebk7KBXL7ZQkjJ5AkBczew", "user_id": "DDalAoCjCGYSb-yMm8L_cA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "I was very disappointed with my meal. I was so eager for the Pokey. What I got was 2 slices of sourdough bread deep fried. There was a morsel of pulled pork in each half (the biggest piece was a slab of fat) and a total of 3 macaroni.
