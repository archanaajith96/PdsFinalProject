Trusting those recommendations, my sister and I decided to go here.It's a small restaurant with a busy bar room. The setup is nice, there are real open flame candlesticks at the tables which were a nice touch but also a fearful fire hazard. I really appreciated the pitcher of ice water that they keep at each table. The waitress filled my glass with it every chance she got. The service was fantastic.Prices are a little high on the menu but for the amount of food, and the quality of the food, it was just right.They supply you with warm bread as a starter and I was disappointed with how cold the butter was because it was impossible to spread, however, they also give you a roasted red pepper oil and that was out of this world fantastic! So flavorful that we had to get seconds!For dinner, I ordered the pasta with seafood (I appreciate the name being simple). It had a delicious saffron garlic sauce over linguini with clams, calamari, shrimp and the best part... Salmon! I get seafood pasta meals just about everywhere I go, and this was the first time that Salmon was included in my dish. I loved it! My sister ordered some Ricotta Eggplant Medallions and although they tasted good, they were really cold. I don't think it was meant to be a cold dish? She didn't send it back, though she probably should have but we were kind of on a tight timeframe. Overall, I would highly recommend you check this place out for a special event like a birthday or anniversary!"}, {"review_id": "9Xz6T8PWWER3rYexnbeglQ", "user_id": "WDNo8ijTRREGGftekLWBBQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I went to Left Bank for dinner last week as a celebration dinner when my boyfriend's dad was in town. We had gone once before, for a birthday, and had a good (but expensive) dinner. This time we started with the Santa Fe flatbread and gulf shrimp as appetizers. I didn't taste the shrimp, as there were three of us and only two shrimpies! The guys said it was fabulous. I thoroughly enjoyed the flatbread and honestly would have been perfectly happy with that as my meal. I loved the pico de gallo as the \"tomato\" component- so much fresher and more texturally satisfying than your typical pizza sauce. The flavors were fresh, exciting, and blended well. This was honestly my favorite part of the meal. For my entree, I got the penne arrabiatta with calamari. The calamari was fried and seemed kind of an afterthought, just sitting on top and not really blending with the dish. I guess that could have been expected, though. It also wasn't really seasoned. If I got that dish again, I would get it without the calamari. The pasta itself was perfection. As I was eating it, I realized that might be what I ordered the other time I was at Left Bank... guess I'm a creature of habit! The portion was huge... it essentially made two and a half meals because I ate it for lunch one day and had some left over still. I love how the prosciutto is cut in little matchsticks so it's not overwhelming but it doesn't get lost in the sauce and is easy to pick up along with the pasta. It definitely has a little heat to it, just the perfect amount of spice! For dessert, the three of us shared the carrot cake and chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. The carrot cake was good but nothing special and not as moist as others I've had. I was very excited about the cheesecake but was a little disappointed. The chocolate seemed to be unsweetened and the bitterness really cut through the sweetness in a way that gathered over the course of a few bites. The \"cookie dough\" is a chocolate chip cookie crust. Maybe that's what I get for ordering a junk food sounding treat at a fancy restaurant? Service was good- our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly."}, {"review_id": "bWBDqevlZHaap1JCEo8cJA", "user_id": "Mvm4VcAixEptjFFgfQVuMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "This past Tuesday night was my first experience at The Left Bank for a friends birthday. We had a reservation at 7 for 4 and were seated promptly. When you first walk in you're introduced to the bar area with the seating area off to the right hand side. The lighting is quite dark but that offers an intimate, candlelit mood. I enjoyed the decor of the building and table settings. To start off, the menu offers quite a variety of different things, appetizers, soups, Italian dishes, meat entrees and focaccia. The waitress also read us the specials of the day. They also have a pretty interesting $10 cocktail menu and I had a hard time choosing which one to try! I ended up trying a peach cocktail which was nicely blended and flavored and had a good balance of alcohol. For the food, my table started off with a bruschetta with pork appetizer. It did take quite a long time to come out, however it had a really nice flavor and presentation. For the main dish, I went with the Pasta and Seafood. It took 1.5 hours from the time we were seated to receive our entree. This was very disappointing. The server barely came to check on us at all during this hour and a half and our cocktails went dry for about an hour before she checked in to so we could order another while waiting. When the entrees finally came out I will say the dish was pretty interesting. It came with a variety of seafood with linguine pasta. The seafood in the dish however were quite small, teeny tiny muscles and clams which didn't seem fresh - not worth the $27! I was also disappointed because the menu did not state that the dish came with cheese on top and I'm currently not able to eat dairy. I ended up having to pick through much of the dish. Overall this restaurant has nice decor, cocktails and menu however the service and the wait for food to be served was very disappointing and why I'm not giving 5 stars. I will likely come back to try some of the other items and the menus and other cocktails, however I will prepare myself to wait 1.5 plus hours for food."}, {"review_id": "sp9M8c-F8uCXs6aKXag8kg", "user_id": "NNL1zLTP2J_SOputgoPYeQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "It's been a while since I've been to Left Bank, but I recently saw it pop up on Yelp and thought it'd be a nice choice for some drink / apps with my wife.

My wife had a few gin and tonics, while I laid back with a tea. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer which was delightful. Smoky and delightful with some BBQ pork, peppers and an amazing dip - at $12 - it was a little pricey for 4 pieces, but each bite was pretty heavenly so I'd say it was worth it.Definitely a romantic place and highly recommended for dinner and/or a bar outing!

The food is above average quality but this is definitely not fine dining. For the price the food is not worth it all. It's very crowded and cramped in here as well. The table clothes are white disposable ones, basically just a huge parchment paper over the table. My girl & I came here to celebrate are 8 year anniversary and we were very disappointed. We came all dressed up expecting a fine dining type restaurant and when we got in there mostly everyone was dressed casually, some even with shorts on. I made a reservation over a month in advance, while making the reservation I asked for 6:00 PM and they said they could only do 5:45 PM which I thought was strange because I was booking six weeks in advance  but thought to myself \"wow this place must be the best of the best.\" The selection on the menu is not the best. We started off with two cocktails from the specialty menu. For $10 they were very basic and mostly ice. There was so much ice that is was stacked higher than the actual glass. After the cocktail I wanted a beer, the beer menu is super vague. It will tell you the brands of the beer but not the actually type of beer (whether it is light, dark, or any details.) The only tell you what type of beer it is when you are about to order which forces you to make an on the spot panic decision. We got the fondue for 2 which ended up being a damn candle over a side dish of cheese. The steak that came with it was very chewy and the asparagus was super tough. I ordered the steak pasta which was not very good. The steak was not tender at all and it was super well done. I am not impressed with this place at all, for the amount of money you spend here it is a rip off in my opinion. I could spend the same amount at other places and receive food, service, & atmosphere that will be light years away from this place."}, {"review_id": "YUL8tlw83D3ewBm4rcI1RQ", "user_id": "MCFaMArvWdRn59Zzg4zkWg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "I am so happy that my girlfriend suggested the Left Bank for a late night \"snack\".

Like I said, we were just looking for somewhere to get a nice, small, late night bite - so I ordered a cider & the mushroom soup. My girlfriend ordered the Grilled Shrimp on Artichoke Bottoms, both were divine. I'll pretty much order the mushroom soup every single time I'm there for dinner. It's the perfect combination of savory rich flavors & it's packed with wild mushrooms!I would certainly recommend The Left Bank for a romantic night out, a special occasion, or just a low-key spot that's off the beaten path for a nice late night bite."}, {"review_id": "PfujPAHL1ykQcfStV5eEPw", "user_id": "IGd2K9c_AUXg-IBT0H5slA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary and I'm glad I did here! The service was lovely and the food was wonderful. The flavor are grand and they were not skimping on the portion either. The whole environment is dimly lit and romantic. It's not a casual setting where you can have T-shirt and jeans; you need to dress up a bit. With the dim lights and the candlelight on our table, I would highly recommend this place for date night! Food: 4.5/5We got their ravioli, and I got their special of the day pasta which came with smoked salmon and cherry tomatoes. The ravioli was average tasting to me but my boyfriend enjoyed it. It was an average ravioli except for the size of it. It was the size of... 1.5 iPhone 8+'s? Or a size of a small clutch? Hahahah! Overall, I would give it a 4/5. It was something one should try but I personally wouldn't get it again. As for the pasta dish I got, oh my goodness. The first bite I took was addicting. Even though I was full, I didn't want to stop because it was so delicious. I am a huge fan of anything salmon. Especially smoked salmon, so that, with healthy amounts of whole roasted garlic, was great. It was a bit oily and greasy, but it was still great. The only downside was when I reheat the food at home, there was a huge puddle of oil on the bottom. Drinks: 4/5I can't really decide what to rate for the 1 drink we got. We ordered this lavender cocktail. It was a bit pricy, with any cocktail on their menu being $10. It came with a little plastic sword and a maraschino cherry. It was a solid drink but I didn't really taste the lavender, even though it had the word lavender in its name. Service: 5/5When we entered the restaurant, it was very busy. The bar and the seating area of the restaurant was packed. But without a reservation on a Sunday evening, we were seated within 10-15 minutes. Our waitress was very sweet to us. Asking us how our food was, and was constantly checking up on us. I appreciate it when waiters/waitress' do check up on their tables. She was very patient with us, especially cause we took a while to order. (We didn't know which dish to pick!). I wasn't able to pick up her name but the service here is well rounded. Overall (tldr):- The food was great. Get the smoked salmon pasta! - The service was amazing with the waitress/waiters willing to help/assist you. - The drinks are a bit overpriced but it's worth a try. - Would come here again."}, {"review_id": "aaSolv9wHWe7P_37mdWtNQ", "user_id": "Nn9Eg7Kd9TgnjDH2YMUlsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "I've been hearing about the Left Bank for years, but I don't do fancy meals very often. My friend and I were celebrating though, so I thought it was a perfect time to try it. The ambience is really great. Brick, low-lighting, warm, cozy and romantic and old. You could tell how popular it is by the number of people there on a Sunday night...even at the bar. The seats weren't what I'd call comfortable, and there's paper over the table cloths, so it's not excessively fancy. The menu descriptions weren't overly pompous either. High-brow but accessible. I had the pork loin for $23, and I was shocked at how much food was on my plate. The sauce was rich and amazing. Really delicious meal. My friend had heard about the ravioli so he tried that. They were really accommodating and offered to swap out the chicken for mushrooms since he's vegetarian. We were shocked they made each one so individually. He loved it and said it was fantastic.The only complaint was the noise. There aren't that many customers, but there aren't any noise absorbers (?), so at times the volume of the chatter was really overwhelming and deafening.We had a really special dinner, though, and the place is great."}, {"review_id": "JW9bsZLFyqCtH1fRtU_r5Q", "user_id": "HhfNSpdHGSGiuyi1anEOCQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "I have been here several times.... but I just never got around to reviewing this place (until now). Two of us stopped in last night for a late meal. We were nicely greeted and shown to a lovely table. The whole setting and vibe of this place is terrific! It's dimly lit and warm and welcoming... definitely on par with places reminiscent of its name sake. The wine and cocktail lists are fabulous.... and the menu has many great options. The two of us decided to share a couple of the smaller items: The Hot Banana Peppers and a Margherita Focaccia. The peppers were the best either of us have ever had. They were baked in San Marzano tomato sauce and topped with asiago cheese and shredded basil (none of that annoying bread and sausage stuffing....yuck!). These were light, yet very flavorful... and the fresh flavors really shined. The focaccia was a freshly baked flattened mini-bread loaf topped with plum tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil.... and served with freshly roasted garlic. I was slightly disappointed with the texture of the bread... it was lighter (and whiter) than a true focaccia, but the freshness of the toppings (almost) made up for it. It was definitely enough for two of us to share.Desserts are provided by \"The Dessert Deli\" in Williamsville. The Orange Chocolate Layer Cake we shared (layers of dark chocolate cake with a layer each of orange and chocolate mousse) managed to be both deeply flavorful and somewhat light. We will definitely be back (again and again....).

Our server was a true professional, yet friendly. It is so refreshing to go to a restaurant and not have a careless 17-year-old wait on you. Instead, this woman was kind, quick, and knowledgeable. She came over a perfect amount of times - not overbearing, not ignoring us.The restaurant ambiance is cozy and slightly upscale. I felt comfortable. You are served right away with bread with olive oil and butter, and ice water. My only, singular complaint of the entire dinner is the olive oil served with the bread. I believe it was tomato based, as it was orangish/red with an odd flavor of just tomato and grease. Definitely didn't understand this attempt to be different. Just stick with plain, good olive oil. Otherwise I can't speak highly enough of the food. We started with fried oysters. The serving is a good size, I was impressed. It came with a chunky, spicy zesty sauce and fresh salsa.  My husband ordered a steak that came with fingerling potatoes and green beans. Pretty sure he didn't come up for air while eating. He said it was cooked perfectly. I was struck by the cheese tortellini when I saw it on the menu. Normally don't go for pasta at restaurants but it hit a nerve and I ordered it. It was the best pasta I've ever tasted. Cheese tortellini, mushrooms, red pepper, and spinach sitting in a bath of garlicy, cheesy cream sauce. I can't wait to come back here and try other dishes.

We made a reservation the night before because we previously had quite a bit of difficulty getting a dinner table at The Left Bank without one. Anyway, this time we had no trouble getting a reservation on the later side at 1:00.The restaurant seemed pretty full when we arrived, but we were nevertheless immediately seated outside (at our request). The patio, which neither the wife or I knew existed, looked really nice. However, I will say that there were a lot of very unwelcome bees. The wife doesn't care for insects generally much less those that sting, so we seriously considered moving inside. However, my dad made them a peace offering of syrup which was reasonably effective.As for the food, my and my wife's meals were nearly perfect. She ordered the Belgian Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and I ordered the French Toast. Her Eggs Benedict was legit the best I've had. The eggs were served over a waffle instead of an English muffin, which added a sweetness that I always crave at breakfast. Even though my main focus was definitely on stealing my wife's EB while she was swatting at bees, my French Toast was also very good. The only issue with the dish was that no one at the table seemed to enjoy the orange cranberry chambord. Fortunately, the waitress was more than happy to bring us pure maple syrup. The grand marnier whipped cream was amazing. By the end of the meal we were putting it on everything from bacon to pineapple.To drink I ordered a Morning Mule, which was a simple twist on a Moscow Mule using grapefruit. It tasted great and was very refreshing on a hot summer day. My dad doesn't drink much, but he ordered his own after taking a sip of mine.All in all it was a very nice brunch. The only real negative was the bees, but the food was so good that I'm willing to let that go. Although I can't speak for the inside, the patio cleared out pretty quickly after 1:00, so I would think that walk-ins are possible around this time.

My girlfriend and I figured we would give it a shot for Valentine's Day.Our reservation was confirmed for 8:45. We did not get to take a seat at our table until after 9:20.Upon arrival to the table, the server was completely abrasive to start through greeting and ordering. We traditionally get Calamari  as a starter where ever we go at least once. The calamari tasted old, and was overcooked. Our server did show some attentiveness at this point and when he noticed we weren't eating it, came over and tried to fix the problem. We knew the flavor was off, maybe a bad order of calamari, maybe old; tough to speculate, but we knew it wasn't right. We just wanted him to take it away, he insisted with us that if they remade it, we would enjoy the second round more. It was the same, overcooked objectively bad calamari. Moving forward, the entrees were just OK. My date ordered a special from the Valentines menu, and said it was good; Pesto pasta with chicken sausage and burrata. I ordered a steam from the menu, the flavors were good, but the steak was overcooked into oblivion. It was ordered medium rare, and I was not interested in waiting for another re-fire. After the meal was over, my girlfriend and I were chatting about the plans for the rest of the night, what we liked, and disliked about the food. Until our server, from the server station located below us, moved all of the plants and items from the railing, and decided to interject into our conversation. My girlfriend attempted to deter the conversation as nothing was going to come of it, we had paid our bill, left the tip and were enjoying the last part of our cocktails. Again, the server was abrasive and pushed her to talk about our meals, to which she eventually decided to share with him, after he pressured enough. When she did finally say something, he came off as stand offish and rejecting her input and thoughts about HER dining experience, which he had asked for.This was a terrible experience from start to finish.

The other reason I'm writing today is because my food was a bit on the overdone side and that is very unlike Left Bank. The breakfast bruschetta comes on a nice crisp bread so it must be either grilled or toasted.  Two of my pieces were so blackened around a decent portion of the perimeter that I couldn't eat them.  Granted, the portion was huge --- so I didn't need them / miss them, but if cooked properly they could have been good for leftovers, etc. My husband's were a little over toasted in spots but not bad - more coloring than taste.  I took a picture of his bruschetta because it was more attractively displayed; mine were maybe 15 - 20% more well done.  (He pointed out that as an objective Yelper I must mention it.) That said, most of the bruschetta was good, the seafood chowder was amazing and full of large chunks of scallops, shrimp, salmon, etc. Our guests were both thrilled with the hard-to-make benedict dishes."}, {"review_id": "0vXf2hN1UAQPe3cS8eP1eg", "user_id": "2ggIGl2G3AnhTQGgw_4flg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "This is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Buffalo.
