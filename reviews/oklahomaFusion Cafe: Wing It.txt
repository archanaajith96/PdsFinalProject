While they don't have a large selection of flavors, the crispiness of these wings is second to none. I don't know what kind of Korean magic they're performing back in the kitchen to achieve such crispiness and frankly my dear I don't give a damn. Even though the wings take center stage, don't miss out on the incredible rice bowls. The bulging i is perfectly marinated and leaves nothing else to be desired (other than the wings). The one drawback to Wing it: they aren't open on Mondays for Monday Night Football wings."}, {"review_id": "1ERC8HT7b25HwaNiOVAR_g", "user_id": "C1vCFC8iZ1mBiKiQiUIyTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "One of my favorite restaurants in Norman.

I've been coming here for years and I've never been disappointed! It's a really small place (~5 tables) run by an older Korean couple who is always welcoming and nice. The menu is limited but don't let that deter you because it's all amazing. Try the wings!! My favorite sauce is the one called hot but it's not the hot buffalo sauce you're thinking of! And don't worry, it's not blazing spicy or anything. It's Korean styled chicken wings so it's got that special, life-changing crunch when you bite into it. And the wings come with a small side of refreshing pickled radish! If you love potatoes, you have to try the potato stew. She'll ask how spicy you want it (I always go max) and the stew just gives me that warm, fuzzy feeling. Perfect for the cold days. Will come back again and again."}, {"review_id": "Vrd-ULqtB8dAeX9ajOoSHg", "user_id": "ib34GrnPmUfVsSAaoQuKXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/2/2017", "text": "Ah, I love that I can find Korean fried chicken here at Norman. I ordered the spicy teriyaki chicken wings and the gamjatang (potato stew). I thought the gamjatang was what this place was about. It was simply delicious. The spice, the meat, the potatoes, they all went so well in the soup. I'm craving the stew right now! I know everyone's raving about the chicken but I urge you to try the potato stew. For the wings, I thought it lacked sauce. The signature Korean fried chicken crisp is there and perfect. The batter crunches like it should. The chicken is juicy as it should be. However, I just thought they don't put enough sauce on there. I'm not much of an \"original\" chicken guy, I love my sauce on chicken hahahah. I come to Norman at random times for work and was sad that this place closes through random times. Maybe I'm just unlucky but this happened the last two times I was in Norman. I couldn't eat here last time I came because the sign said it was closed through early November (I was in Norman late October). Why do they do this to me :(."}, {"review_id": "z8FkrueHVLbqG8W0kVC40A", "user_id": "ICVclKH4AJB9QgH-OkigRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "I came in with my mom and a couple of her friends to try this place out. It's right across from Norman high and it's pretty legit! It's a little hole in the wall mom and pop shop with some really really good KFC (Korean fried chicken). The other food was pretty bland and I was super sad about it. I always get the seafood tofu stew because it's my favorite and I was extremely disappointed with how little they put in and how much they charge. If you guys get anything just stick to the wings because you can get more elsewhere at a cheaper price with more sides. They've got three different sauces but definitely try the garlic soy because it's absolutely phenomenal!"}, {"review_id": "5cq_kj0ks0-8CuJwab3eMw", "user_id": "FOWsDzd-XNALoSnrSG8AfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "This review is solely based on their unbelievable wings. They're exceptional. My only knock is that the limited flavor options. I like short and simple but I would've also liked to have had at least one more choice. The wings are perfectly sauced and fried. I could literally eat 50 of them. Rice and kimchi are great compliments. Oh, they have great kimchi!

My boyfriend and I always order about 12 wings for the two of us, because they are just that good. We'll get half and half of the garlic soy and spicy teriyaki. The wings are always crispy and juicy and never over-fried. The amount of sauce on each wing is always perfect--not too saucy and never lacking. If only there were more side dishes!

This is not a complaint. They were delicious. The garlic soy wings were equally tasty. The crunch on those wings! I cannot attest to the other menu items, but all 4 other tables left empty bowls of soup and noodles. The smell was intoxicatingly. So, yeah.
