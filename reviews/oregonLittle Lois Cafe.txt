I also love how every person's name is on their lunch bag...just like little ones! For $10, you get a sandwich, side, water, chips, and dessert...a complete meal.  This is a great value for the quality, I can't emphasize that enough. I just wish they'd move up to Portland! Out of what I've tried, I recommend getting the Pesto Deluxe (turkey and ham sandwich with a nice combination of different sauces), the caesar bow tie with chicken (the best side by far) for your side, and a brownie (so decadent and delicious). What makes this place stand out even more, however, is the fact that everything is packed with care and thoughtfulness. The sandwich ingredients are stacked nicely and the little napkin set you get is so thoughtful. The napkin is thick which is appreciated, and they even put a mini pack of tic-tacs for after your meal! Ultimately, this place just wins. Bonus: the owners are really friendly too!"}, {"review_id": "86wdHz8fMF9_2ympF2hsUg", "user_id": "InhYmwnyXbbLJLt5BEWmdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "I have used Little Lois's online group order system to provide lunches for large meetings many times over the last year or two. Every single time, it has been simple, on-time, delicious, and loved by the meeting attendees. From the food to service to the packaging- very well done! As someone who is responsible for arranging lunches for large meetings with many participants, I can't recommend this enough. Everyone gets to select their own food, I don't have to track down every person's order, and I can log in to see who has submitted and who has not."}, {"review_id": "4coJL96-cXG--53vD83stg", "user_id": "wmTyWT2K_ixRcmZSjt5BFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "If you want something fun, great, and carefree order here!I love getting their bagged lunches!

They work around allergies and are EXTREMELY attentive to the needs. Vegan/Vegetarian/Gluten free options!! The best part is the little pack of tictacs! It is beyond fun.

We stopped in today just minutes before noon and barely beat the rush. I had the Spicy Roast Beef Supreme and my spouse had the French Dip. Both sandwiches came with chips on the side. If I had it to do over, I would have opted for the potato salad - I heard it was good. The roast beef sandwich was excellent - for my palate this sandwich was not \"spicy\" it had a bit of heat that was attributed to the jalapeños but not something that I would consider spicy. The flavor was great, however.The French Dip was decent.What sets this restaurant apart from many others, was the staff and the cleanliness!  Too often restaurants have that \"diner smell\" or the \"greasy diner feel\" but this place does not! And the staff were delightful - we even had a conversation with Lois and she, too, was very friendly and helpful.My family and I will definitely stop in again and have lunch...and next time I will certainly get the potato salad."}, {"review_id": "PxQ1nZYp9yUeIcjFszOciQ", "user_id": "DbIPBm5EoPcJ54blQFjVag", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Little Lois is a place when you are too lazy to go out and pick up your food, they will deliver it to you!

I placed an Uber eats order and when I got it, it was taped up in the cutest bag and everything was handled with such care. It came with the cutest napkin, moist towelette, salt and pepper, utensils and a peppermint. The small details are what makes it so amazing. I have to eat gluten free and I ordered a wrap. When it came the wrap was such high quality I had to call to see if it was actually gluten free. I tried chick-pea and they were awful! Taking people's money when they paid for a larger size and not actually delivering said large size. I recommend the business advertising their gluten free items on Uber eats so that it can be seen without clicking into the sandwiches that there are gluten free options. I'm so sad I ever gave money to other companies.

I order and picked up the first time yesterday. The place was a little tricky to find, but once I found it I parked. I walked up and had a baby carrier in one hand. A gentleman (who I assume is the owner) came up to me and told me he would gladly bring my food to me. It was really great costumer service! Another note is that the food is really yummy. I had a ham sandwich and tortellini salad. It also comes with chips, a delicious dessert (a had a huge cookie) and water (or other choice if you'd like). It also came in a cooler bag.
