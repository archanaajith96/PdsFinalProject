The service is always very nice and helpful if you are indecisive. The best part about their menu is the perfectly prepared coffee starting with the right bean and roast. They avoid the sugary syrup flavors and also offer some homemade breakfast fares on some mornings (I think it's just on Sundays but I may be wrong).Overall I think everyone would benefit from stopping in at Archetype while exploring Blackstone."}, {"review_id": "uCB9zpYAbJ0spU9cZzpJAg", "user_id": "yCJRSasPU2f3By-eP41uQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Great tasting coffee and super convenient if you're headed into Nebraska Medical Center.

Coffee can be an art and Archetype has mastered it. I have visited on many occasions as it was located just up the street from my previous employment and made for the perfect mid morning coffee date! The lattes are warm, rich and beautiful. My favorite order is definitely the chai latte which is both smooth and spicy and absolutely delightful. I love that they also offer pastries that pair perfectly with their beverage selections. The ambiance of the shop is perfect for a coffee date! Overall a wonderful Omaha coffee establishment!"}, {"review_id": "R-6cMpW2FMuTP9ZsI0MuqA", "user_id": "UaPKX1z-pAl7gegTK6DfyA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "Based on my limited time in Omaha, this was the coolest coffee shop we visited. Well, we actually visited it twice so that speaks for itself. Loved the barista we ordered from. We must have given off that \"not from around here vibe\" and she wanted to know what brought us to Omaha. Our response, \"The 2017 eclipse!\" She knew the small town we'd be driving to witness the celestial show and just made us feel really welcome by giving us tips for things to see.The iced lates with almond milk are top notch. Smooth, creamy flavor just the way I like it. Tip: If you like places to study or just casually meet with people, this is a great spot. The exposed brick gives it that really hip yet cozy feel."}, {"review_id": "UKQewV__zQCUT0Rf0knvdQ", "user_id": "_TyQ8G6jjTY_B8XzkxA3cg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "One of the coolest coffee places ever.
