It also matters that they have the funniest names for the sandwich options. Literally a great classic Italian restaurant deli in this area. Every time I go in, there is almost always a line close to the door because everyone loves it here. Each sandwich is prepared fresh, whatever you order they will take the hunk of ham/turkey/salami and slice it for your sandwich in front of you. Nothing sits there and everything is made fresh. The slices of mozzarella are delicious with any sandwich. I ordered the Soprano, can't wait to go back and try something else. My boyfriend ordered the turkey and mozz. We were both ecstatic with the great quality and average prices ($8) for basically a footlong fresh sub! Staff is super friendly, a bunch of guys from old to young, all Italian maybe and they were very helpful and very nice to every client.Will definitely return for more sandwiches!"}, {"review_id": "3KsULSXG6MPF8mRs8fyqjQ", "user_id": "Hi10sGSZNxQH3NLyWSZ1oA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "\"It Mutz Have Been Love\" by MutzetteLay a sandwichOn my pillowLeave the KetchupOn the groundI wake up hungryThe sound of trafficIn HobokenAnd all aroundFeed me nowI close my eyesAnd munch awayIt Mutz have been loveWith Andrea nowIt tastes so damn goodBut I dropped it somehow(f*** it, five second rule)It Mutz have been loveWith Andrea nowFrom the moment I chompedTo the time it ran outOver 200 reviews with a 5-star average? Fake reviews? Or the world's best deli?It's the latter.What to get: Hey Cuz, What's Up, Prosciutto w/ Fresh Mutz.Always: Get Fresh Mutz.And then: Join me in singing \"It Mutz have been love\"Owned by Andrea Bocelli, Andrea Lloyd Weber, Andreea aka Sahara (but thankfully Costi doesn't have a stake in it, but he does eat steak in it), and Andrea Dice Clay, this is one of the very best delis in North America. Here at Andrea, I like the Hey Cuz and the What's Up, but you can't go wrong with anything. Getting Prosciutto with Fresh Mutz it's always a winning combination but everything they sell is a winning combination. They have good prices, even though they don't do half sandwiches, which is slightly annoying. If you visit North Jersey and don't visit this Deli and the aforementioned others, then you are really really really missing out and I feel bad for you, son. I've got 99 delis but there ain't one that is as good as the ones in North Jersey.As I have said before, the big secret is that Northern NJ is home to the best Italian delis in the world. Well I should say Italian-American but you knew what I meant when I said it. There are some great ones in Chicago and NYC (although I kinda consider this NYC but shh), in Albany and even Dallas. But there is nothing as good as what is in Hoboken and Jersey City and Union City.There are a dozen spots in Ho-broken and nearby Jurbs (Jersey Burbs), all vying for the title of the world's best Italian Deli, and in the end it really comes down to the \"big 5\" (although I'm still exploring and finding new ones). I can't decide which of the 5 is best, and people I've taken to them have differing opinions. Although one thing we all agree on is: if the other 4 didn't exist, then the one remaining would be the best in the world. That's how good these 5 are.Vito's, M & P Biancamano, Fran's, Andrea Salumeria, and Fiore. If I had a gun to my head and I had to pick one: I'd take all 5.The selling point of all 5 (and all good delis in this area) is that they have Fresh Mozzarella. It's literally fresh, like, still gooey, warm, squidy, just made, and absolute heaven. Their imported meats are the best of the best. Their breads and seasonings, incomparable. You can't get any better than these sandwiches. Come and try for yourself. They have ruined all Italian delis everywhere for me, forever. For a traditional Italian sandwich, nothing will ever compare to Hoboken.Andrea is right up there in the top five in both this region and nationally. Their fresh mozzarella is a warm gooey piece of heaven. They will give you a free sample if you ask for it. You will simply never find a better Deli then this. It's right up there, along with Vito's, Fiore, Fran's, and M & P Biancamano - all within 2 miles of this place. They have nicer service here at Andrea than most of the others, too.The region is legendary for its freshly-made, warm, gooey, Fresh Mozzarella (aka Mutz), so make sure you try that, and get it on your sandwich.Now let's finish up with some more Mutzette:It Mutz have been loveWith Andrea nowA Wich is all that I wantedNow I'm gulping one downIt Mutz have been loveWith Andrea nowIt's where the Mutz growsIt's where the food never blowsAnd finally, a nice Mutzy rap:I wanna give some advice to everyone HEREAnd trust me on this, cuz I'm being SINCEREIf you want the best deli, the answer's CLEARThis is a place you will all REVEREIt doesn't sell a Bagel with a fancy SMEARAnd they don't blast Sinatra in your EARThe best deli is not on the Venice PIEROr that place you went with that girl from CHEEROr some hipster place selling Buffalo and DEEROr some gastro-deli with local-sourced BEEROr f*** Subway (he says with a SNEER)(Eating at Subway is my biggest FEAR)(Join with me in this Subway JEER)(And also Jimmy John's does not ENDEAR)The best deli is not in NYC (but it's NEAR)Or even in Italy (which is quite QUEER)It's over in NJ with all the top TIERIf you take your stripper GF, the men will LEERCan you blame them for staring when they SEE HER?She came several times with me last YEARAnd I feel like a tire cuz it was a GOODYEARCrap I just rhymed year with YEARAnyway let's continue, we haven't got all YEARThe bread is delicious and the meat is SEVEREHow the cheese is so good is UNCLEARThe wiches aren't DEAR and they cost a MERESeven or eight dollars, then they DISAPPEARAs soon as they're handed to you by the CASHIERFor the best sandwiches in the Western HEMISPHEREHead to Andrea SALUMERIAWHAT"}, {"review_id": "j6f10jgsVLBk72VCGhwvNQ", "user_id": "Erca0gY4ZiTxNMgIzNVERg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Nothing says home than a combo sub and a Boylan's ginger ale.Deserves every 5 star review"}, {"review_id": "lURqljzkWH-GP2irHvPJVw", "user_id": "PMMcGelLIQEF_7mILSBkJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "I have been drooling over all the sandwich pics over the last few months and finally got to chance to visit last week.  It's a bit tucked away in Jersey City heights, so parking could get tough.  Don't give up so easily though, because the extra effort is going to be worth it.Despite the fact that they only show 4 options on the sandwich menu, those are just suggestions.  The staff here can pretty much make anything you want if you want to order.  Speaking of staff, they are probably the nicest people in all of Jersey City.  Perfect atmosphere for a family business, no wonder they have been going strong since 1975.Since I wanted to try everything, I ordered the Soprano, the What's Up, the Combo, plus an extra side of fresh mutz to go.  It's not mozzarella around Hoboken or Jersey City, just mutz...Favorite turned out to be the Soprano.  Loved the contrast of the sun dried tomato against the creamy mozzarella and the perfectly cured prosciutto.  Could have finished the whole thing by myself, but decided to stick with the original game plan and sample the rest of the sandwiches as well.What's Up definitely lived up to the hype as well.  It carried a good bit of heat from the meat as well as the spicy peppers.  The only thing that I would opt out of next time would be the chunks of sharp provolone they put in there.  It was just throwing me off a bit.Overall, a great little deli with extremely reasonable prices for the quality that they put out.  Will be back again really soon."}, {"review_id": "sMAW9zY2caCswHx8B2am6w", "user_id": "tS5LPH6BHzDJ1OVF0yAm9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "This is a staple to the Jersey City area.

They mix salami, ham, provolone, lettuce and tomatoes in this drool worthy combo of oil and vinegar. Stuff it in a container and serve it with Italian bread.

Super small Italian grocery/sandwich shop in the JC heights. Really narrow aisle to the counter to order, which made me feel like I was in an alleyway in Italy. Came in around 130pm on a Saturday afternoon with ~8-10 customers in front of us. Line moved really quickly and I checked at the pasta in the frig, meats and cheeses in the glass, and some pantry items on the shelves while waiting.We ordered a ball of fresh mozzarella (they keep this in the back), the what's up (hot everything sandwich with provolone), and prosciutto, Mozz, peppers and balsamic on a hero. Goddamn these sandwiches. Phenomenal floury bread just soft enough on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside. Generous servings of meat and mozz on the sandwiches. Everything tasted super fresh with real Italian flavors. Soft mozz that literally falls apart in your mouth. Total bill came to ~$30. I'm nyc, these sandwiches could have costed $18 each. Will most definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "_TyG6TZL2bv2VcWOKHFytw", "user_id": "84t6jpyclA55TMfMV0X0kA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/15/2017", "text": "Like everyone else has said, this is a damn good Italian sandwich. I still have my Hoboken go-to's, but this is no doubt the best that you can find in JC.The reason this sammie is so amazing is pretty simple. It's filled to the brim with meats, fresh mutz and veggies. So basically, it's all you could want from an Italian sandwich and more. The bread is perfectly baked and the portions are massive. One sandwich is easily enough to feed two people. We ordered two for two people and it was an unnecessary amount of food. I ended up eating half for lunch and half for din.I ordered a soprano which had fresh mutz, prosciutto, sopressata and sun dried tomato. The meat to cheese ratio was absolutely perfect and each bite was heavenly. My only complaint is that the sandwich was a bit oily so next time I'd ask them to go lighter. Otherwise, this was a top notch sandwich experience.While the menu is pretty basic lunch fare (sandwiches, salads, soups, etc) the storefront is actually a small speciality grocery store. You can find a variety of cold and packaged Italian grocery items. You can tell that most of the brands are authentic Italian. It's no surprise that Andrea Salumeria is a well known local favorite and is consistently ranked one of the best (if not the best)  Italian sandwiches in NJ. It's for sure worth a visit."}, {"review_id": "fex3gtWOR1ay4uNK2vd4IQ", "user_id": "VeCwvsEdaDjqLKF5Rh80zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Fresh ingredients, quality products, personal....this is the way a sandwich experience should be. I've been here a handful of times but admittedly forgot about this place until recently when I had a hankering for a good sub (sorry, subway eat fresh). This place has a limited menu and with good reason - everything they make is outstanding. I love anything with their sun dried tomatoes or their fresh mozzarella and typically make sure that whatever sandwich I get those are both included in some way.The staff is super friendly and quick. While you wait you can look around at all of their italian imports - I would imagine this is the kind of spot you'd visit if you want to make an authentic, home cooked Italian meal because they probably have ingredients there you can't get in too many other places.so go. goooooo. it's so worth the illegal fire hydrant park with your hazards on."}, {"review_id": "EgkUYevtPxArm3_zpwGwig", "user_id": "YCmbCe_ejj-FjmHJJtENOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "I feel like a review for this place isn't even needed anymore at this point. There's a reason why this is voted #1 deli, in Hudson County every year. I love this place. It's a few streets from my job and they do deliver during the lunch hours. It is definitely one of the more pricey delis, but you 100% get what you pay for. High quality deli meat, great fresh mozz and a great Italian bread. Also, the sandwiches are HUGE! For a normal person (not me), half of one of these sandwich's would probably be filling. I get the same thing every time I order, the What's Up, basically has all the spicy Italian meats, mozz and hot peppers.

As of this writing they're around $9 or $10 dollars. They're very big and filling and, most importantly, fresh and tasty. I love Italian meats and cheeses, and so to find a deli in the area that makes super sandwiches is like a godsend. If you're a light eater, the sandwiches are big enough to save some of it for later or share it with another light eater.Came here for lunch the other day and ordered some sandwiches.WHAT'S UP~ the spicy sandwich, with hot capicola and hot peppers. If you like spiciness, this is the way to go; I was perspiring while eating the sandwich due to the heat. It was still good, thoroughly liked it.SOPRANO~ sopressata, prosciutto, mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes, EVOO. The general intensity of the sun dried tomatoes gave the sandwich robustness, and again, the freshness of the bread, meats, and cheeses made everything a really enjoyable and tasty sandwich.Since they're a deli they sell meats and cheeses and other specialty items by themselves by the pound. Also, everything is to-go, it's not a sit-down place.

It was sliced so thick though that some bites were overpowered by the cheese.I also liked that the onions they used were mild and didn't give me heartburn all day. Bread was nice and thick, and just right hardness-wise. Oil and vinegar was excellent. Overall, delicious.The rest of the store was kinda boring- hardly any prepared dishes, and small inside.
