The amount of different sliders is intriguing. I haven't had the opportunity of trying all of them yet but for the most part, they've all been at least solid. Another thing I appreciate about this place is that it's not very expensive. Pretty much everything on the menu is $3 or less. While portions aren't exactly large (I mean, they're sliders), it also only takes around 3 items to be at least satisfied. Even their alcohol is inexpensive compared to other restaurants. Green Dot Stables is a neat place to be."}, {"review_id": "XNjFp5SyQXPjSiW86O-Nuw", "user_id": "m9laNy4IB78PUjNwKqFe9g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Slider joint.  Tasty especially if you want variety of flavor.  Every item is approx $3.  But I feel it is a bit expensive for what you get.  I end up spending like $15-20 per person and I always leave still hungry.

YesWhat I Ordered: Too Many Things To List!(+)- Great Variety/Unique Food- Good Pricing- Mystery Meat Changes Weekly!(-)- Small Venue = Long Wait Times- Horrible Parking At TimesGreen Dot Stables, in my opinion, is true Detroit. At one time, no commercialized restaurant or store wanted to take the chance on Detroit. Up pops places like Green Dot. The city is lucky to have places like this. Offering a truly unique experience, Green Dot Stables is affordable and something special. Everything on the menu is under $3 and are things you won't find at other places. I always order 5-6 items per visit (french fries, multiple sliders). Anytime someone from out of town is here and wants to try something new, Green Dot Stables is usually the place I take them. ** Always try the mystery meat, even if you don't think you'll like it!"}, {"review_id": "21gXE93AcDLgEI7UDbVptA", "user_id": "8-qdVEtNAi4usXZHACMavg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "I love love love this place. Seriously can't get enough. Anytime anyone wants to go out, I immediately jump the gun and ask if we can go to Green Dot. The only downside is that there is almost always a wait (I think I got seated right away for a party of two once, but that was the first time that has ever happened). In the summer time I actually don't mind waiting. I grab a beer and head to their back patio for a little. In the winter its just ehhh, not as great (but still worth the wait).For the food, seriously I don't think you can go wrong here. Everything they have is amazing. Even their weird weekly specials that sound rather interesting and unique (because they are), still taste amazing. Green dot has seriously found the way to perfect every single slider they make. Buffalo chicken, fried chicken caesar (add cheese on it and thank me later), BBQ bacon, and cuban are just a few of my favorites. Also you can't forget about the french fries. I'm torn between the cajun and the truffle and herb, so I always have to get one of both. As well as a side of cucumbers and mac and cheese. Seriously I could go on about this place all day. Service is awesome, I've never had a bad experience here. If you're stuck in a pickle about what to get - just ask. Everyone is more than willing to help you out and make it so you have the best experience ever.Sliders are rather small, which is nice because you don't have to commit all to one flavor, you get to try multiple. I'd say about 3-4 sliders and splitting some apps and you will leave full and very happy."}, {"review_id": "XSCqMHxWNC1QwduafGvUfQ", "user_id": "cc7qRAate2Rb-LtMn7N9Gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Green Dot Stables is a fun place to try a plethora of creative slider concoctions, and delicious sides for a relatively cheap price. Almost everything on the menu is $3...sliders, fries, soups, salads, and most drinks which can definitely add up as everything on the menu sounds incredibly delicious and you'll want to try it all. Expect it to be very busy when you visit and they don't take reservations. We had a party of five (pun not intended) and we waited a half hour to 40 minutes on a Friday night. They won't seat your group until all members of your party are present. It's a small space and gets fairly crowded so all parties waiting for a table waited in their enclosed patio, outside of the main restaurant. It did get a little cold out there. They had picnic tables and a small bar area so we grabbed a drink while we waited. I tried a caramel apple cocktail which again was only about $3 and was delicious. When we were seated, our waitress was very warm and friendly and explained the menu to us. The service was good and she checked on us throughout the meal, even though it was busy. The sliders menu rotates so every time you go, there may be some different ones on the menu. They have a mystery meat slider, which this time was a camel joe, camel meat, with white cheddar and potato chips, which sounded interesting. They had over 22 different sliders on the menu and I tried the BBQ bacon, Phily cheesesteak, fried chicken, and s'mores sliders. The fried chicken slider was my favorite and was dipped in maple syrup, reminiscent of chicken and waffles, yum! The s'mores dessert slider was really good, with warm chocolate, marshmallow and toasted bun. A couple of my friends tried the duck tenders slider which had an orange glaze, chow mein and scallions on it and they said it was really good. Green Dot also has lots of small sides including truffle and Cajun fries, poutine fries, salads, mac and cheese, parikash soup and more, all for about $3. I tried the truffle fries and they were very good. One of my friends tried the poutine which he said was good. All menu items are small which is great so that you can try a myriad of different items. Probably about three sliders and sharing a couple sides will quell your appetite. Green Dot has a derby, horse racing theme so of course I had to try the mint julep which was delicious. They have barn door style doors, horses painted everywhere and even horse racing splashed across their TVs. They have their own private parking lot which is also nice. Green Dot is a great inexpensive place to go with friends to try some creative tasty slider creations but they are insanely popular so be prepared to wait for a length  of time. It definitely is worth it."}, {"review_id": "03OwWKZRUVYdVClz1dn3OA", "user_id": "UwZ9tsDIEF5egW0FwMh74Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "I had been wanting to try this place out for a while and decided to stop by for a day in Downtown. This place thankfully has their own parking lot so my friend and I didn't have to pay for parking, which can be an issue when getting friends to come try out places downtown. What I liked about this place is that you can get a bunch of different things on the cheap. I wanted to try maybe 5-8 sliders but since this stop was more of an appetizer for our day in Detroit we limited it to 3 plus fries. My friend and I had pork belly, mystery, crispy duck and one other fried chicken one. They were all pretty good for the price except for the crispy duck, it was all crispy and hardly no duck. I would try it again when I come back to see if it was just the duck or the fryer that day. As far as fries go my friend had the venison chili and and I had the poutine. I can't comment on his experience but I very much enjoyed the crispy fries the gravy was well seasoned and the cheese curds were a unique addition to traditional poutine. All in all our bill was about $15 bucks per person and a cool experience to boot."}, {"review_id": "9MXQMfZX3-RiRy6lEDokqQ", "user_id": "mMUtDfRecxttDxdvjiGVXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I haven't been here in about a year, but this maybe my favorite place to eat while in Detroit.

Each slider is only about $2-3 which is perfect for what you get, and the a la carte menu makes it easy to try multiple different kinds for cheap.

Very old school but the food is good and the liquor, wine and beer selection are satisfying. They have tasty sliders and the poutine fries are to die for. They suggest you order 2 sliders which would compare to a regular burger somewhere else. The area Green Dots is located in isn't the best but it's not the worst Detroit has to offer either. The server was very professional and have some menu selection favorites he liked and explained in detail the flavor each one brought to your taste buds. They could do with some remodeling but some might say this style is trendy. You can't be there prices. All the sliders are $3 and the sides are reasonably priced as well.

I live about 20 min outside the city and drove in here to meet some friends to have dinner. The beer is great and the atmosphere is right what I expected. I love the \"low key\" part of the place. It's more or less a great thing since it's low maintenance compared to other places serving similar foods. We all shared the cajun and truffle fries. They were actually so good we ordered more cajun fries and finished them off. They had a great dry rub taste. I ordered 5 burgers. (don't judge me, I worked out in the morning. lol) I ordered the same burgers, all of them were cheeseburgers. I love that they were simple and good. They were all cooked the same way. I put a little mustard on them and it gave it the taste I was looking for. All in all, it was a great place and atmosphere! I would come back here again and look forward to doing so.

Their food is excellent with an awesome atmosphere of an old bar. TVs everywhere, playing a ton of sporting events. My advice to you is if you don't like waiting or big crowds, make sure there is no major sporting event happening in the downtown area at the time you would like to go. Or maybe consider going during lunch. Favorite slider? The coney! It's a nice ode to Detroit.

The cornbeef was good.The staff I felt could have been a bit more friendlier. When I walked in, about 5 people walked right past me without a greeting or anything. My bad for not initially seeing the hostess stand, but a simple hello or are you looking for someone would have been nice.The hostess was very helpful though.

There's usually a wait if you arrive around dinner time, so I'd recommend showing up at off times (1pm or so right after lunch or 5pm before dinner) to really get the best experience. They have seating both at tables and at the bar inside, with a dedicated parking lot and an abundance of street parking nearby. Note,they won't seat you without the full party, so be prepared for that. Upon arriving, you'll be greeted by friendly wait staff, and be asked if you've ever been here before. If you answer no, they'll explain to you that most people get sliders, and that most people choose to get 3-5 sliders. (At a few dollars a piece,this can get to be a $$ meal, especially with a drink) Green Dot has a good selection of drinks and beers, too! Carb conscious/ Keto folks: Don't think that you won't be able to get enough food here! It's true that many of the sliders tend to be on the carby side, but the staff is very willing to do sliders with no bun (without qualms). My favorites to get are the cheeseburger, Hot Brown, and Buffalo Chicken (don't worry, it's grilled, not breaded). I do tend to get 5 sliders as without the bun, it does take a bit more to fill you up."}, {"review_id": "fwT7dHeroZvvf_19KxGxGg", "user_id": "IzFrZDe6Xs0kGfqz6wt7Dw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Came here for the first time with some friends on our lunch break.

I went with the fried chicken caesar, pork belly, fried catfish, mystery meat (fired lobster), an order of the truffle herb fries. BOMB!! I loved the fries, light and crispy.
