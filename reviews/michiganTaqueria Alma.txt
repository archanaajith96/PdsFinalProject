Friendly people, fast service, great everything.  The only problem I have is ordering too much damned food and getting incredibly full."}, {"review_id": "PT9WCnUBlfIFsMuTEf2uiA", "user_id": "f9mashQqu4S9UNxIFNicow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "super simple take out place in a strip mall.i got 3 tacos.. total was $5.88  and SO MUCH CHICKEN in my small baby taco.. it could barely holdchicken was delicious and fresh topped with cilantro and onions.it came with a small tub of salsa verde which was really good.i am looking forward to returning."}, {"review_id": "KY0rjA53ecpbz0-rk3Eqag", "user_id": "O45gffye1TDQUvM9gQYs3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "This place is primarily \"TO GO,\" however they do have chairs to sit while you wait for your order, if you didn't call ahead \"and\" they have one table.The drink choices are the glass bottles of \"Jarritus\" various flavors at $1.89 per bottle.Anything that is $5 or less will incur a .50 cent additional charge, if using a credit/debit card...yes, they accept AMEX...yay!!!Food is great and prices are normal."}, {"review_id": "nyTkYZWqWbNPo6qsQwN_OQ", "user_id": "GQHnS9pXHrjf1jx9IffrPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "The wait was longer than most takeout only places.

Overall maybe a 3.5-4 Only got three different kind of tacos from here. Found overall was good. Not my favorite place though. Though I have to say, they are super generous with their protein! Enough to make two tacos out of each one. They sure do stuff your tacos! Their spicy taco is delicious. It's creamy based and I love that. Service was cool. It's a take out place but they were nice. I wish they had tripe still. Really wanted to try it. I probably won't come here as often since I do have others that I prefer.

I didn't like the place at first, the steak was just chopped up and burnt. I tried the tacos and can eat like 10 of the ground beef ones. Don't really like chirezo. I trying something called a tostado with chicken, now I see what the big fuss is about-that chicken is what's up!!! The tostado was just like a flat hard shell taco with beans n shit on it but the chicken made it! I think someone said Thursday is $1.25 gringo taco day so try it then. If you like it try it again. Only thing that got me \"like whoa\" was the $8.50 for nachos. Updated 1-14-17I cannot get past the chicken tacos, burritos, and that flouta thing. I wanna try everything but the chicken is so good!"}, {"review_id": "SQ886eEgENOUahdNm0uv6w", "user_id": "fURZG7iI056RWb9rhpx2qA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2017", "text": "Some of the BEST Tacos I've ever had and they're pretty cheap too so you can get a bunch of them, this place has become a place I visit at least once a week now! The Tamales are great as well and there are so many options I still haven't tried everything. It also very quick so if you're driving by and you hungry you should definitely stop by! The workers are very nice as well! All in all this is a great place to stop and get quick tacos! My recommendation, both a chicken and beef taco with a tamale and a Mexican Pepsi (Should be like $7 or $8 in total)"}, {"review_id": "-IRvlH17c0p4s9CXZ7f6Lw", "user_id": "XFvPNIlErZoxWmbhS9q4jg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/31/2017", "text": "Awesome burrito!
