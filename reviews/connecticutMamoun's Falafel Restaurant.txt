The shop is pretty spacious and empty when we got here, though it seems that various people get their meals to-go. We came here after hearing about their falafels, and decided on 2 falafel sandwiches and one lamb sandwich. Personally, one falafel sandwich was good for me, granted I have a smaller appetite. The falafels were definitely one of the best I've had, with a soft and moist interior and a great crispiness on the outside. Love the textures in the sandwich! On the other hand, we found the lamb sandwich to be much more expensive for a slightly smaller portion, so we probably won't be returning for this. We also got the mango iced tea, which tastes like a mixture between mango nectar and sweet tea, which you can't go wrong with.All in all, the sandwiches were tasty without being too heavy. As a fan of falafels, Mamoun's is a great place to go, especially for that classic and basic falafel sandwich!"}, {"review_id": "OuJRFOQf_j9wVmNIu5K-Tg", "user_id": "RCBnPqv-QDjQ_HPJO8oWVw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "You can't really go wrong with Mamoun's Falafel. This New York City staple has also been in New Haven for decades and offers incredibly priced fresh falafel and other middle eastern dishes. For less than four dollars, you get a fresh and delicious falafel sandwich covered in tahini and filled with salad.  They also have an extensive menu of meat options, plates, salads, soups, savoury pastries like spinach pie, and desserts. The hot sauce is famous for its flavour and spice level. The people who work here are courteous and attentive. Mamoun's is the place to go for a quick meal or a late night snack."}, {"review_id": "MgJSUysGJF22_3ZpYUQBwQ", "user_id": "sGP9iOL4rJIE6M76ozY-2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Really tasty schwarma plate which is thinly sliced lamb on top of a bed of mixed lettuce etc. the Syrian lamb dish was more of a chunk/patty in a cream sauce that was very yummy for dipping pita breads in. This is a small eatery that does both take out and sit in- Everything is served in disposable paper plates type stuff. They have a wide range of desserts at the front- bakalwa/baklava was a little bit soggy, but flavored deliciously with some herb.I would come here again to get a good takeout wrap or plate that doesn't make me feel greasy.

I don't remember the prices being as high in NYC, but for the quality (and the sentimentality), I would go for it.Most recently, I got the lamb shawarma sandwich ($7.75), and I really loved the flavors. It was also packed with some of the regular goodies like the cucumber and tomato salad and tahini. It was one of the most satisfying shawarma sandwich I've had in a long time.This spot can definitely get busy, so budget some time."}, {"review_id": "vj9NkL2MUcQQqVSXEaqZTA", "user_id": "WA9fjdFYyWon5ecMRUrJRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Mamoun's is awesome.

It's super cheap and everything I've tried is tasty. If you do pay with card, they do ask if you want to add tip to it because they don't have a tip write in on the receipt. You can usually get a table to sit whenever you come in. We usually order the chicken kafta sandwich, lamb kafta kebob sandwich, falafels, and hummus plate. The service is really slow, but the food makes up for it. Prefer eating here over Halal guys and other Mediterranean restaurants. Chicken/lamb kafta sandwich: a pita filled with fresh veggies, white sauce, and chicken or lamb. The chicken patties are flavorful and juicy. It's so tasty that I can eat it every single day. It's a pretty decent sized sandwich, similar in size to a burger. I do not like eating lamb because lamb is very gamey, but their lamb patties are not gamey at all. If you get the plates, the only differences are that they put the pita on the side and add rice.Hummus plate: their hummus is pretty good. I like how they have lots of fresh veggies to eat with the pita bread. It comes with 2 pita breads and is a really good appetizer dish that is more than enough for 2 people. Falafel: these are good too with lots of flavor, but they're really small and don't stand out compare to the meat dishes. They're extra crispy on the outside and have just a little softness on the inside."}, {"review_id": "vsO3dw3q12oZtK64IEXOCA", "user_id": "ezXHP2tMK7D7W7DzI5AG9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Loveeeeee there falafel sandwiches, they are like 4 bucks a piece, can eat about 3 or 4 of them in one sitting, most of the time just two though.

I only say this because I feel that this genetic gift means that I can spot good Middle Eastern with a more discerning pallet than most. But I had gotten to the point where I had pretty much tried ALL the Middle Eastern dining options in my \"safe zone\" area. But then my kid went to college in New Haven...HELLO NEW DINING OPTIONS!One of my wife's co-workers has suggested that the ONLY place to do Middle Eastern in New Haven was Mamoun's. We have so little experience with the New Haven food scene, we didn't even question or discuss it; basically it was \"next time we're in New Haven, we're going there!\"The \"next time\" ended up being a Friday night around 6:30pm. We had just picked up our son from school and decided to stop there on the way home. 4 of us total including the daughter. We were glad to see parking available behind the building, and downtown New Haven on a Friday night is basically \"nuts to butts\" as far as parking. It's a small lot, but it worked!Walked ourselves inside and were seated promptly. The place isn't huge, and there was a pretty good sized party already there. But we surmised that they get busier later and also do a lot of take out, there were plenty of seats available. And let me just say, if the smell in this place doesn't make you ravenously hungry, you might not have a digestive system.Waitress came over promptly and took our order, which consistent of 2 falafel sandwiches, and 2 Meat combo plates. We also went ahead and got a hummus appetizer because...when in Rome right????Food came out promptly, all served on paper plates and drinks in paper cup...and we freaking loved that. Divey, but quaint and genuine. And I'll say this: the food here was nothing like I've had near me. I mean, the flavors were similar, the building blocks the same kinda, but it was different. Super fresh meat, tangy hummus that was some of the best we've had. Even the pitas tasted fresh and homemade and NOT out of a bag. I mean, we devoured, everything, in about 10 minutes. The most startling thing was, I actually am NOT a big fan of the Falafel, just never liked it when the family ordered it at the local joints. But yeah, LOVED them hear, inhaled 3 of them like a champ.Family agreed unanimously that this had to be a regular stop from now on. If you're anywhere within 30 minutes of this place, and you want to get in touch with your inner Middle Easterner...this is a must try."}, {"review_id": "BSQtswBihVaiPXcqRiCDvg", "user_id": "wr7e1tTgza1nZL1YozoYGg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/13/2017", "text": "$10 credit card minimum- add tip before swipingBf and I came here starving for early dinner after apartment hunting. It's a sit-in/take-out place that is much larger than the OG in NYC.ORDER-Combo w/o meat: Loved the salad, humus and baba ganoush. I can never get enough of it, haha! It's just weird to see baba ganoush green. But the falafels were too hard and scratched the roof of my mouth. Not a big fan. Meal comes with only 2 pitas-Lamb shwarma dish: salad with lots of delicious meat slices. We thought it'd come with rice, but I guess not. Normally bf orders the gyro at the NYC location bc it's easier to eat on the street. Since we were sitting down, he thought might as well try the full meal. It's definitely filling, but kind of disappointed it didn't come with rice.Overall, bf loves the NYC location more. Food is much better. Prices are the same as NYC, which I was not expecting. Service is kind of nonexistent. I had to refill my own water which I'm fine with, but I'm angry for paying tip. We never recieved bf's order of mamoun's tea, and the waitress crossed it off our bill. They definitely need more waiter help- hence the wanted sign posted on the window. Most likely will be ordering take out from here until we find a better mediterranean joint in this small town."}, {"review_id": "_tRTmVjxH-2CJ7oNzLiqpQ", "user_id": "s-Ouqe754JCISrnXW3NHIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Come on if your a New Yorker and you see this in New Haven you know what is up.  This is the ultimate college lunch/ dinner destination.  Instead of using your college food stipend in college cafe, go here.  The falafels are outstanding, hummus, you name it it's amazing.  Ask any NYU student and they can validate this gem of a restaurant.  $20 gets you plenty.  This is a definite stopover if your in New Haven."}, {"review_id": "DLflEKdKHFTMfGrirEB-6g", "user_id": "sD-Fv39R2RrXqgQgPgJdgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "1am on a school night; very hot sauce; low prices; combo platter; very good falafel; meats; lots of hummus.That is not a haiku, but the food is really damn good."}, {"review_id": "PPx-uF37nNPJXkI2zQdGhA", "user_id": "CqUus9IxNY1-YTFnjQzD-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "blown away; best falafel I've had in long long time!!

Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.It's always a little frustrating waiting forever for your food to be made and delivered, but a little worse when it seems like the entire staff is joking around and not paying attention. When my food was finally ready 20+ minutes later (for a plate that's mostly cold, already prepared items, mind you), they tried to charge me again.....Nah. Luckily that was figured out and I left soon enough to eat my bounty.As for the combination plate? Thankfully, it was pretty much the same thing I've eaten time after time again in NYC.

I ordered the meat combination plate with shish kabob, which costs $14 and is supposed to come with \"3 falafel balls\", quoted directly from their menu. I have attached a photo of my combination plate - notice how there are three half-pieces of falafel. Mamoun's literally cut falafel balls in half and gave me three of these half-pieces, which they put in the plate face down so that it wouldn't be immediately apparent that they were ripping me off. I flipped them face up before taking the photo to show how scummy they are. Besides being only 1.5 pieces of falafel instead of 3, the falafel itself was also dry and utterly cold. You know that taste where you leave deep-fried food out for hours and the oil turns cold and cloying? Yup, I have zero doubt that the falafel they served me had been sitting in a tray for hours. The single shish kabob that was included in the plate was also a teeny tiny portion. For $14 this plate was a terrible value - just go to newly opened Halal Guys on Chapel, or Pitaziki on Temple, and get double the amount of food and triple the tastiness for $8. I sincerely hope Mamoun's goes out of business soon. The owner seems to be a stingy cheapskate, that would also explain why the lights are never on in the restaurant during the daytime so it felt like I was walking into an abandoned building and not a dining establishment.Just... don't ever come here, unless you like half-portions of cold pre-made food for $14.edit: 24 hours after my meal, food poisoning symptoms... thanks to the cold mystery meat \"kabob\".

The restaurant is very authentic looking with a large picture of Mamoun himself hanging above the register and various cultural photographers. It's actually pretty cool and adds to the experience. I ordered a falafel, or fried balls (chickpeas and other spices) of goodness stuffed in a pita with lettuce and a tahini sauce. It was very tasty, but not very filling. I would have enjoyed it if there were more balls in the pita or if the pita was a bit larger. I also got a spinach roll drizzled with a nice white sauce drizzled over it and tomatoes and unions. The spinach was wrapped in a light flaky wrap that was then gently fried. It was decent, but didn't blow me away. The meal itself was decent, but it isn't a place I would go back to again and again. I often become a creature of habit, and will latch on to a good lunch spot for a few days. Mamoun's is more of a novelty spot. It is well known in New Haven and the food is interesting and different. It is vegetarian friendly, and I would say if you are not a carnivore and in search of a different type of fare for lunch than Mamoun's  is the place for you. I can also picture Mamoun's being a nice place to stop after a long night out on the town. The food isn't that filling, but it is rather tasty.
