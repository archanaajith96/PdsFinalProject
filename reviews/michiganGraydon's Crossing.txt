The open sign was on and it looked interesting.  They have a nice assortment of Michigan beers from several breweries. I still got my Vivant beer, and they had another from old nation which is one of my husbands favorites from the Williamston brewery. The interior was super cozy and definitely felt like a European pub. Perfect on a windy and cold Michigan \"spring\" day. We ordered the onion rings for an appetizer and they are HUGE. Kind of like onion ring donuts. Once they cooled a bit the batter hardened just enough so that they were easy to eat without falling apart. We ordered the butter chicken and burger for our entrees. My husband ordered his burger medium rare and they cooked it perfectly. The butter chicken needed a little salt but was very good.  We finished with the key lime creme brûlée. Had a great afternoon here, our server was very friendly as well. Hope to stop again before too long. If I lived in the area I would frequent this place for beers."}, {"review_id": "oV_V-163ru-Q7qjd6zKyUA", "user_id": "7sdLR0xYLRM-rJfORMVpqQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Underwhelming:We came a little early on a Saturday (shortly after 5).  The sign outside directed us to seat ourselves, without a host/hostess we found a table in upstairs dining room, where the server clearly wasn't ready for us.  The appetizer was the best bite: na'an chips and chutney.  However they came sans utensils about 90 seconds before our entrees.  Seriously, how hard is it to plate some chips and salsa? I didn't have time to enjoy the cold appetizer when my hot meal came.  Both our meals were under seasoned: which is surprising for a place fashioned around Indian cuisine.  The steak was over cooked and had a peculiar texture as a result. Rarely do I have need to add salt, but today I wished that there was seasoning available at the table"}, {"review_id": "9GfiOjgA9u2Eiw3oWDlq4w", "user_id": "t1kMUfSEb9h5v8eRz1WykA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "What was once our favorite date spot has changed.

This establishment has been around since 2008 I believe and they have had their ups and downs but have always been a solid spot to drink and get the goods. This particular visit made me realize why I love this place so much. Came for dinner with my parents and enjoyed solid service, good beer and an all-around amazing meal. No one was for want and we all left full and satisfied. This is how it should be and exactly how it was this particular night. Big hats off to the chef and the staff that made this dinner a great one. The goods for the night that blew our socks off were the beer cheese. Solid appetizer. So good. The Danbury loaded with lots of meat and oh so good! The Indian BBQ stuffed with veggies and had my wife licking her fingers. She wouldn't even share any!  Parents had the grill cheese which was super souped up and mom was happy. Dad couldn't even eat all his Carriage House beef and was so happy with all that fall off the bone meat! The beers were spectacular. Had a couple sours suggested by our awesome waiter and some stouts we chose. Nothing but five stars for us here!"}, {"review_id": "jng8M7aYaHsrqMOwIEzImA", "user_id": "b2ji2mA-CWIjVWnXwhtqdA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Food and libations would deserve more stars. Staff competence doesn't deserve a single star. While sitting at Graydon's Crossing eating lunch today, we experienced a father asking the server if the men's room had a changing table. She promptly stated neither the men's or women's restroom did. Th server then said: \"yeah, and it's our fault we don't... so feel free to change her anywhere.\" The father then proceeds to change the daughter's poopy diaper on a dining table, taking an extended amount of time to do so while casually chatting with a friend. The table he chose was in the path of all food coming out of the upstairs kitchen. He changed the diaper in front of all of us, with no concern for the other guests, and no privacy for the child. The father didn't wash his hands and the staff didn't wash the table. Multiple staff members walked by to witness the encounter and said nothing. Disgusting. Appalling. If the staff was incompetent enough to allow such an event, it certainly makes you question how competent they are in proper cleaning and food handling. I wish I could write a review for the father as well."}, {"review_id": "Zo94F9Q7VMLt8w4-L5uzbw", "user_id": "Fr096Ontzxiby4TJzt7RoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Great casual dining experience that pleased three very different pallets. I got the \"Burrito\" (meatless) and didn't think it was lacking for wont of meat. It had a nice curry flavor, a little kick, and the pickled onions helped cut the richness. Friends got Carriage-house Beef & Pondicherry Wrap, with a side of fries. They were both pleased, although there was a comment about the tandoori chicken in the Wrap being really chewy/fatty. Drinks were good. Dessert was amazing. The birthday girl got the crème brûlée and my friend and I split brownie skillet. Talk about death by chocolate.

I ordered the burrito with grilled chicken and as soon as it came to the table, our server Jacqueline realized that she didn't tell them to add the grilled chicken. She ran (literally) up the stairs to put my corrected order in. She came back down with a basket of homemade chips with dipping sauce as I waited. When it did come out, she apologized and said it was in the house. Not only that, but then the manager then stopped at our table with a coupon titled \"Missed Opportunity\" that gives us $15 off our next visit.  And this was all because of a mistake I did NOT complain about, but rather the server noticed the error first. I applaud Jacqueline and the manager for handling this, without complaint. I've never been more impressed with how a restaurant made up for an error. Bravo!That story aside, the food was really good! A creative menu with unique flavors. And the hostess, manager and server were all very kind. Jacquline is the type of kind personality that you want to come back for.

Worked a couple miles from here for 23 years. Had a friend that was a cook here for a few years and yet I have never been here until today. Had a coupon for a free brunch. Why did I wait so long. My wife and I both decided on the Grayson's special. 3 eggs, beer bacon, sausage, potatoes, toast, and a fruit cup. Now your thinking, how could a place like this be rated on a simple breakfast? Easy, if they can't do a simple breakfast right, probably can't do other meals correctly. Start with the eggs. Mine were over easy and they were done to perfection. Not slimy near the yolk and still had a liquid yolk. Wife's were scrambled and they were nice and fluffy. Beer bacon was awesome. Sausage was a tad dry but the seasoning was great. Just a touch of heat that arrived after you ate it. The potatoes were done just right. Uneven cut cubes that I'm guessing were deep fried. Golden brown on all sides and tender on the inside. The homemade bread was thicker than your average slice of toast. Very nice. The fruit cup had chunks of melon, pineapple, and cantaloupe. What can I say? The simple breakfast was done right. I expect they can manage lunch and dinner just the same. Need to try a burger next. Until next time. Visit a local pub. A ton of them have excellent food."}, {"review_id": "56QCGQqg9iZlA7mcpN9V9Q", "user_id": "sEtCa2XU2-rym1DuTCzzCQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "This is our neighborhood watering hole.

The hostess led us up the old, creaky staircase to the second floor where she seated us by a window facing downtown. After introducing the menu, our server went over their expansive beer list with us. I selected a mead while my friend chose a beer that was described as having \"hints of licorice.\" The mead was fantastic, not too sweet with plenty of that flowery honey taste coming through. My friend absolutely hated his beer, to the point it was almost comical! Not a licorice fan apparently. Our server was very understanding and swapped it out for a glass of mead instead.As for the food, I'd read other reviews endorsing the maitake mushroom vindaloo so that's what I selected. My request for it to be made gluten-free (which meant no breaded/fried mushroom on top) was accommodated graciously. The vindaloo was delicious! One of the best dishes I've had out in a while. Hard to describe but the flavors, slight heat and spice just made for such a complete and enjoyable dish. Adding a fresh crème brulee for dessert was the perfect way to end the meal.The only thing, besides the beer (which happens) that we didn't like about our experience was that after talking a while over dessert and drinks we did start feeling rushed by staff to leave."}, {"review_id": "T2h1NZ9HlqBlJ8S80g7Zag", "user_id": "P_xwITx7y6EZICoUh0xpeA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "An underrated brew pub, with about 48 beers on tap!

I used to go weekly about a decade ago. I have since moved away, but went back last weekend while visiting GR. Things have changed, but I believe for the better. Being a vegetarian, I appreciate the numerous offerings. However, I have to say please take the jack fruit off the menu until a better recipe is found. I cook jackfruit and it turns out flavorful and chewy like meat. Their jackfruit tasted like it was hardly cooked and fresh out of the can. Maybe lightly pickled? Either way, it was really horrible. Even my vegetarian \"I'll eat anything that is vegetarian\" husband said is was gross.  Please take it off the menu and revamp the recipe. Bad vegetarian food doesn't help vegetarians or those considering eating less meat.
