The folks working were a bit wacky, but fun to watch.  The tea sucked, but you can't have everything you want... shut up about the tea, ok.You start your journey into this place by jumping into a line that wraps all around the place.  You can see folks eating while you walk through the line.  It is sizable, but it moves super quick.  Once you get to the counter you'll see somewhat of a buffet style setup.  But everything is pretty fresh and cooked while you are in the line.  The folks cooking and serving were extremely friendly.  They will help you through getting what you want.  The lady in front of us was a little unsure what she wanted (and kind of holding up the line).  The servers/chefs ordered for her.  She said she wasn't sure and they reassured her that she would like it (keeping the line moving).  She was overjoyed when she started eating it.The cashier was a bit spaced out and it took a few times telling her what we had ordered to get it right, but it didn't bother us and didn't slow anything down much.The food really was amazing.  The best BBQ we had in Saint Louis.  They also had an \"adult shake\" which had bourbon and sounded interesting, but we were too stuffed to get one.  Next time..."}, {"review_id": "xyulMc15W4PqhW6DI0nCmA", "user_id": "FGtjPswtHjcecqiWmIsRiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "That is some great BBQ!  Got ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.

I ordered the combo with 4 pcs of bbq ribs, 2 pcs of thinly sliced brisket and pulled pork like a size of a tennis ball and 2 sides fries and potato salad for about $22. Since I'm a small eater I shared it with my friend and we're both full. There are 6 different kinds of sauces for the meats and I like the white sauce and the bbq sauce. I find brisket dry so that's my only complaint.If you come in a group, you cannot have somebody save a table for the group coz somebody will check on this which I think fair."}, {"review_id": "X-bM3eGkKcIUBmGJJh3FWw", "user_id": "-WNercB7MdU17NZvHdLXLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "This place is elite.

Came here with a coworker for dinner last night and I was happy I went there. It's a small place with a cafeteria style set up. The line was out the door when we arrived but it moved rather quickly.I ordered a 2 meat combo of salmon and pulled turkey with 2 sides of a spinach corn casserole and potato salad. All of it came out hot and was pretty good. You could even sample something if you weren't too sure about a choice.  There was even a milkshake setup but I was too full to try it.Good crowd and atmosphere made it a good spot to stop and have dinner.

We were to the front of the line in approximately 15-20 minutes, which I felt was pretty damn good, considering how many people were in front of us.  But enough about formalities, let's talk food.    My wife, 5 year old and I split the Meat Daddy plate for $22.95, which is a pretty good bargain. The plate includes:4-bone rib - These were pretty darn good and kudos to them for not slathering them in sauce, as there are several varieties of sauces on each table from which to choose. Jalapeno cheddar sausage link - Sausage had a nice snap and the jalapeno was not overpowering.  It had just enough heat, which paired perfectly with the smoke. 4 ounces of brisket - Although not the most tender that I've ever had, the brisket hear was pretty solid.  Almost all of the fat had been trimmed off which means you get more meat for your money.  However, I prefer a deeper, more pronounced smoke ring in mine.4 ounces of pulled pork - Again, not the best I've ever had, but still pretty good.  Perhaps my sample was an anomaly, but unfortunately, mine had a good deal of fat.4 ounces of smoked turkey breast -  Turkey was good to go and quite juicy; because there's nothing worse than a dried out piece of white meat chicken.  Definitively not the case here.For our side items, we chose french fries and collard greens. were french fries and collard greens; and also got an extra 4-bone rib to make sure we had enough food.Sugarfire has soooo many sauces to choose from. They had Cider Vinaigrette, St. Louie Sweet, Texas Hot, Carolina Mustard, White Horseradish, Sugarfire 47, Coffee BBQ, Special Sauce & Ranch.  Perhaps there were others but these are the ones I saw.  Some may think that this is too many choices, but it's a blast tring them all.  In fact, if I ever make it back to St. Louis, I am going to buy 8 ounces of brisket, 4 ounces of pulled pork and a 4 bone rib so that I can try every sauce on each of them.  There are no winners or losers here, as they are all good but simply a personal preference.Sugarfire's dessert menu was vast and could rival Marie Callendar's , but I digress.  Unfortunately, we were too full to indulge in dessert.  If this ever happens to you, I recommend getting a dessert (or 2) to go, as after an hour or so had passed, I was craving some sugar.   Perhaps one of the adult shakes next time.  The only real gripe I have, if you can consider it a legitimate gripe, is that to get to the restroom, you have to walk against the flow of people waiting in line.  Lastly, I think that Sugarfire summed it up best on their website when they stated that  \"Sugarfire Smoke House makes your dirty little food dreams come true every day.\"What more can a person ask for."}, {"review_id": "nHvI76YO2fkG1z4xwna0fA", "user_id": "F7NNPatuHN_Weg1h0n5jag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Consistently delicious! we've tried the burger, ribs, turkey anf definitely recommend the Portabella mushroom sandwich. Really enjoyed all the sides too including brussels sprouts, coleslaw, German potato salad, mac & cheese, french fries. The french fries are not my favorite they end up extra crispy and little tiny pieces but I enjoy a thicker french fry.  Come hungry servings are generous. The ambience is dive bar needs smokehouse, which is perfect and its Always served with a smile. The dining room is all tables seating, it can be kind of elbow to elbow when it gets crazy.No lines generally weeknights except for Friday may be a 10 minute line at the most. I think the craziest I've seen is Saturday afternoon. But the line moves very quickly. There are plenty of soft drinks and they also offer adult milkshakes which I'm definitely down to try.

I got a half rack of the ribs with a side of mac and cheese, tots topped with pulled pork and cornbread. The ribs were absolutely amazing. They were cooked to perfection and the meet easily fell off the rib - thats is how you know it was cooked perfectly. They even have a sauce bar with amazing sauce options: like sweet bbq, coffee bbq, white sauce, north carolina sauce etc. It was incredible! The coffee bbq was shockingly amazing - a must try. The sides were incredible as well - the mac and cheese was really creamy and the pulled pork on top of tops could have easily just been a meal on its own. The cornbread is a must try as well - the best i have ever tried outside of texas.

Because everytime I came here with the intent of eating the standard BBQ fare (ribs, brisket, pulled pork, turkey breast, etc?), something from the specials menu always catches my eye. Some days it's a crazy concoction that throws everything and the kitchen sink in a bun or a tortilla, other times it's something subtle and surprisingly worldly that you'd find on a menu for some bourgie fusion restaurant for twice the price. And every time it was something amazingly delicious.So on my final night in St. Louis, I made it a point to order something from the standard BBQ menu, and while it was excellent and incredibly well prepared, I found myself mildly disappointed. Because as delicious and juicy as their brisket and turkey breast is, you know exactly what you're getting and that can get boring.But that's the great thing about Sugarfire. If you want amazing St. Louis BBQ with all the trimmings done to excellent standards, they got that. If you want something off the wall like brisket meatloaf sandwich with fried green beans and red pepper aoli with cauliflower curry, they got that too. You're completely covered and coming with friends who like to share makes it even better.And if that wasn't enough, the desserts and milkshakes are pretty awesome too.

Came here while on road trip from Ohio back home to Los Angeles California. I've heard St. Louis has some of the best BBQ so I had to check out a local spot. There are plenty of options and best of all plenty of sauces. My personal favorite was the honey badger. I tried the meat daddy with Fries, potato salad, and their house bread with sweet tea. I've never been so satisfied food wise in my life. I highly suggest visiting this spot if your passing this way or if it's a short detour away since it is 100% worth it.

We came really close to closing and they had ran out of ribs already but no matter cause I ordered the Muddy which tasted like HEAVEN. The dude taking my order was so nice and funny, the whole staff looked like they were all friends w each other. Really good atmosphere. Also I hate making decisions so I asked which sandwich I should get and he said \"muddy- all day errday\" lmao so get this you can't go wrong. Also it's bigger than the size of your head for only 10$ it's a great deal. They even hooked it up w cornbread (since end of the day closing) so already that was 5/5 and I had good laughs the entire time I went through ordering my food. how nice everyone was really put the cherry on top.

Ended up at Sugarfire. When we arrived about 6:15 on a Friday night, we expected a wait. The line was just inside the door; not bad and it moved quickly. Guys along the line were all cool. Tough choice on the menu, but I went with the pulled salmon nachos, made with homemade pits chips and a creamy cucumber sauce. The pita chips were very thick and took some work to bite off a piece, but it was worth the work! I haven't seen a dish quite like this. It was tasty and inventive. Added a side of cole slaw.  Hubby had a plate of brisket, pulled pork with beans and fries. He polished it off quickly!

Wow, I was blown away by how good it was. The ribs were beautifully smoked and they weren't overly tender. The smoked and fried artichoke hearts are now my favorite appetizer in the whole world. The brisket Philly cheese was one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. I want to bring my girlfriend all the way to Sugarfire from Scottsdale for three days just to eat here several times. The mac and cheese is perfect. The broccoli pasta tastes like a fancy chef made it. I want to try the burger next--it has brisket and short ribs right in the grind.
