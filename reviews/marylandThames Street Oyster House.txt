I went on a Friday night at 7pm without a reservation, so expected a long wait. Thankfully, they're fully prepared to deal with making a two hour wait as painless as possible. I left my phone number and we headed out to grab drinks elsewhere, and at exactly the two hour mark, I got a text that our table was ready. Easy, as long as you're going in with the knowledge it's going to happen.Inside is relaxed, with a casual beach-side ambience. Service is great, despite being packed. I picked a Mezcal Buck to drink - as expected from the name and ingredients, it's a fresh twist on a Moscow mule. My other half had a gin-based Southside, which he was less enamored with than I was. Food-wise, we both got the lobster rolls. At some point when I come here I might branch out, but frankly they're so good that there's no reason to do so. Don't be put off by the price - obviously, $25 is a lot for a sandwich - but this thing is piled with huge chunks of lobster so it feels totally worth the money. We didn't get anything from the raw bar on this occasion, but I do also highly recommend - especially if you're an oyster lover."}, {"review_id": "mGBKPhBV0L6e7TAXoDkCVQ", "user_id": "Hqh3__TgG8hNSGnnmuEYhQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Pretty restaurant in Baltimore harbor. This is where yelp needs .5 stars again because this is a really 3.5 star place tonight. If you have a big group this isn't a good place though. It's a small house made into a restaurant, so seating is limited. We had six people and they split us up in order to be seated. They could have sat us next to each other though. One of our tables was downstairs and the other upstairs. We started off with the lobster Mac and cheese as an appetizer. It was good but there wasn't much lobster in it. They offer different oysters a la carte and we ordered some. They were fresh. For my entree, I got the crab cakes with asparagus and potato salad.  The crab cake was very filling and flavorful. The reason I would give a 3.5 star review is the server. He seemed pretty irritated and distracted. This place is good, but this is a one visit restaurant for me. I don't think I would return."}, {"review_id": "aoFvcCXiFstcbVdEynquwQ", "user_id": "6zmvPNdt63N8mXyn-EsHLw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "We went here for dinner because it was highly recommended--and that must be so because it was filled to the gills.  We ended up getting seats at the bar--which was just fine, except I couldn't understand a word the bartender said.  He talked really really fast, and there must have been something about the acoustics, because all his words came out sounding like a gigantic muffle.  When he moved to the side to talk to my husband I could understand him slightly better!!We got a fish special that was delicious and the crab cake which was disappointing--not lump crab.  My husband said the bartender had told us that, but because I couldn't understand him, I didn't hear it.  A local spot on the water that feels like it must be quintessential Baltimore Fells Point dining."}, {"review_id": "EdJvAeN9-n1Jl3Ao6sw-Rg", "user_id": "3n5UEZtP96GBNpRXNF0QNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I loved coming to Thames.

I loved every entree that I ordered from this restaurant. Basically you can't go wrong with anything. So this restaurant closes at 2:00; advice is to get in before that time and hope they have seats for you. We got lucky because they had seats at the bar and we came in fifteen minutes before they close. My coworker was searching for famous restaurants on yelp on our drive to Baltimore. This place hit the spot. I loved their lobster roll. They give you a lot of lobster in it too. The scallops were raw. I was expecting them to be cooked. Even though they were raw, they were very high quality scallops and would definitely order again. The calamari is to die for. I would definitely come back when around the area.

This place offers you a great selection of oysters and they come with a clear description of the production site and flavor, a huge plus for those who are not familiar with the oyster sea/landscape. We got four different kinds of oysters, and they taste fresh and nice. I personally would highly recommend Emerald Cove--its pumpy meat and creamy taste are unbeatable!!

After going to another place with mediocre crab entrees, my boyfriend and I were really hoping to get an authentic crab taste before we left Baltimore. After reading a lot of good reviews about this place we decided that this was the place to go to for good seafood, and it certainly did not disappoint!We started off with an order of 4 Chesapeake oysters and 4 Delaware bay oysters. Both types were fresh and clean.Next, we got the scallop ceviche which was also extremely fresh. There was a decent amount of large scallops in the dish. I was definitely not expecting that much scallops when I saw it brought out, but they were all hiding beneath the sauce.My boyfriend got the crabcake and we were surprised at the price. Before coming in, we checked the menu online and it listed the entree for $27, but it was listed as $31 for the menu we saw in person. The price increase could be because crabs were not in season at the time. The crab cakes were delicious and what we were searching for in taste. Every bite was packed with crabs and the size was bigger than we expected for one crab cake. It was basically the same size as a burger patty but double the thickness. Even though we enjoyed it, we still thought it was pretty pricey for just one crab cake. I ordered the rock fish with oysters special and I absolutely enjoyed this entree. The sauce gave the dish a very homey and warm feeling. This entree was also pricey as well since it was $31 but there was a decent amount of oysters in the dish along with the fish.For dessert, we had an apple crisp which was delicious! It's big enough to be split between two people and might probably be a lot for one person after an entire meal. Service here was excellent!! Our water glass was quickly filled everytime it reached the half way mark. Out waitress was also very knowledgeable about the origin of the seafood which I really appreciated. I would definitely recommend this place and come here again if I'm in town!"}, {"review_id": "rLUEV40oHQ6aF_OiG7uRHw", "user_id": "nT9hrb0nJ0CIox17zsyd9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Fresh delicious seafood along the port side!

And there was a Baltimore institution that I needed to check off of my list. So of course I headed to Thames Street Oyster House to get my next lobster roll fix.I went with one of my friends that loves Thames Street Oyster House and she suggested that we each order our own Lobster Roll because it's 'the best in Baltimore.' I'm not one to argue with a statement like that so we each ordered one. The roll was so buttery, without being soggy. And it was filled with plenty of hot tail and claw meat. It was definitely one of those meals that you're legitimately sad when you finish.  The lobster roll came with a side of fries which were crispy and seasoned well.Thames Street has a great lobster roll and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other yummy seafood dishes on their menu."}, {"review_id": "t_GgRg9WQNzcRfI42mNeug", "user_id": "HHtpT4T_a-8LHjLIs6tHvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "My husband and I had a show at Royal Farms this evening so I had researched what the best seafood restaurant was in Baltimore several weeks ago and Thames was listed as number one. I made reservations about two weeks ago. I tried this week to change my reservations so my colleagues could join us but the restaurant was already booked to capacity. That speaks volumes about their popularity.Parking is always fun in Baltimore. We circled around several times before we found street parking. I was informed that they have a parking garage 2.5 blocks away. Beware ladies, there is cobblestone pavement which made walking fun. I can barely walk in flats so be warned if you wear stilettos or heels.Once we entered, I was overwhelmed by how tight the lower level was. Literally if someone were to walk by you'd have to move to the side so I was glad we were seated on the upper level. We got lucky as we were seated by the window and could enjoy the view of the water.My husband and I started off by sharing a bowl of the clam chowder. What I liked what that it was hearty. It had corn, potatoes, celery, and clam. Other places we have been to do not put a lot in the chowder. The flavor was flawless and what chowder should taste like. We then asked our waiter Mike D what he recommended and he said the lobster roll was the most popular so my husband and I decided to go with that. He called it right. It was out of this world. The lobster meat was juicy, flavorful, and a generous amount. Their roll is buttery and reminded me of a buttered pretzel. The combo of lobster meat in a buttery roll is phenomenal. Mike D was great and came to check on us frequently and another employee came around to fill our glasses of water. Service is really great here.Nowhere else has even come close, not even in Boston. My husband gave it a 9 which is the highest rating he has ever given any restaurant for anything. My hat goes off to Thames Street Oyster House for their stellar quality of food and customer service. We will definitely be back the next time we have an event in the area."}, {"review_id": "3YNXl2-kwN-cJsENhlwEFw", "user_id": "qbC0B0DfIqnRbEQXz0m6VQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Hands down the best seafood place downtown. I came here on a Sunday around 1:30 pm expecting it to be crowded. We were told our wait would be 30 minutes but it was only 10! It's literally hit or miss with timing. For appetizer, we ordered the king Neptune oysters, blue point oysters, and top neck clams. It came with a side of mignonette sauce, horseradish, homemade cocktail sauce, and hot sauce. Every sauce combo was perfect with these fresh raw oysters. We also had the cup of clam chowder soup (only served sat and sun). It was delicious. Not too thick, just the right consistency. You could just taste the flavors of the clams in the soup. There's bits of corn and potatoes too! For our entrees, we ordered the lobster roll (A MUST!!!) and the Chesapeake catfish sandwich...it's topped with an egg!!! YUM. The lobster was fresh and there were big chunks of meat! The side of the butter to pour on top was  just perfection with the toasted bread it was served on. At the end, our pickled herring and escargot came out. It was my first time trying escargot...omg it was amazing. It's served with a side of garlic bread. The seasonings and the olive oil in the shells made the dish taste absolutely amazing. Service was excellent. Love the fells point area. I would 100% recommend any locals and out-of-towners to try this place!

So great actually that I made sure to make it my last stop on the way back to the airport. It sits right on the waters edge on a quaint street with other restaurants and bars. Once inside, you'll most likely find that it is fairly busy. I was traveling alone so it wasn't too hard to find an empty seat at the bar. The interior is super clean and well set up. While it was busy each time I went, I never felt crammed. There are two reasons why this place left a lasting impression. One, the service, and two, the food. As mentioned, each time I went I sat at the bar and actually had the luck to be served by the same bartender each time. He was absolutely incredible. Patient with questions, helped with many recommendations, and constantly (without coming off as overbearing) checked in on me to make sure I had everything I needed. The food is also incredible. You must get the lobster roll! It's a little pricey but well worth it. The melted butter and the split top bun compliment the lobster perfectly. On my second visit I got the fried oyster po boy and was not disappointed. Ample amounts of fresh oysters made this sandwich perfect.

I really like the old home feel of the place.After our great experience with the hostess, we had an even greater experience with our server! Teresa was super friendly, efficient, and helpful with recommendations. They had a good drink menu and a large raw bar menu. I loved that we could order just a few things off the raw bar and not commit ourselves to a whole meal there! The actual menu is, obviously, predominately seafood with lots of variety and unique twists on traditional dishes. They also had some amazing sounding specials when we visited! Oh my gosh, I can't wait to return to try some more of the menu items! From the raw bar, we enjoyed scallops with a great horseradish sauce. We kept it traditional with lobster mac and cheese and the lobster roll. Both were out of this world delicious! Overall, such a great experience!
