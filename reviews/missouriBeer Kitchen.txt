Before I decided to give up dairy, I used to come here quite a bit just for the Mac. I usually just ordered it classic but they have a lot of options for add-ons, including burnt ends for you BBQ lovers. BUT- I equally love tamales just as much and they have some bomb Jackfruit Tamales that can be vegan. I don't know that I have really tried any beer here but they do have a pretty good beer list. I like to order Deep Eddy's grapefruit when I come here because they have it for a good price. It stays pretty busy so the wait can sometimes be a bit long, but you always have the option to grab a drink somewhere while you wait for them to text you. Since it's in Westport, parking can be a pain but in my opinion, it's totally worth it!"}, {"review_id": "e7cEcPI06AYqwIm3nBAQGg", "user_id": "7iXpB9GodIii0UlJuaD8sQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I decided I wanted to eat here for my 21st birthday. The food sounded good and was reasonably priced. Our party of 3 arrived around 8 and was seated immediately even though it was kinda busy. We had to wait more than 10 minutes for someone to take our drink orders. Now, I've never been to any KC restaurant, so I don't know a normal wait time, I personally thought it was a little long considering we noticed a table that got sat after us was helped before us. Anyways, our waitress could tell we were kind of irritated and she really did make up for it. I ordered a Mango Mojito, it was a little sweet, hey I just turned 21, I didn't know what to order, but it was still a good first drink. My friend ordered a mango/gin thing and she gave him a gin & tonic. But, she got him what he ordered and still left the gin&tonic to make up for it(really nice gesture but he ended up not drinking it). We ordered our food, I got the build your own mac w/ burnt ends. Absolutely awesome! So creamy and good! My boyfriend got the avocado burger w/ the stockyard fries, he loved em, of course I sampled and yes it was delicious. Our friend got the turkey sandwich w/ a small order of fries, which are a good portion by the way, definitely enough for two people. We all enjoyed every bit. What was really cool is I didn't even tell the waitress it was my birthday and she gave me a complimentary drunken donuts, which were sooo good. I appreciate the service we received from our waitress, didn't catch her name but she had glasses and badass tattoos! Would definitely check out this place again, so much good food!"}, {"review_id": "zgHMLKBV_DOc6XqcrW1JwQ", "user_id": "Iav_-b9JZYFvV_BCHHPCkw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Great food, friendly and fun atmosphere. Perhaps one of the most unique and tasty dishes are Deviled Eggs. A bit smoky, just a touch spicy from the wasabi \"caviar,\" and great, lingering umami from the house-cold smoked salmon on 2 and the Serrano on 2.Other favorite - Build Your Own Mac and Cheese.

The mac and cheese and chicken and waffles were so delicious. We were full, but it was so delicious that we kept thinking 'just one more bite' until it was gone. I didn't think a place called 'beer kitchen' would serve such amazing food. Next time I want to eat mac and cheese, this is my first choice. The waffle was also perfectly cooked, and the fried chicken was amazing. We fully enjoyed our experience.

Have been here three times now. This time we went late, after the KC Royals game. Had beer and wine and appetizers. The fried green tomatoes were wonderful, as was the pork belly. Super!

Meh I wasn't that excited. Good burgers and fries from what I remember.Came here for brunch... Looved it! The menu is awesome, they have lots of choices of savory and sweet. I had the Dutch oven cooked pancake with ham, over medium egg, topped with hollandaise sauce and served with a side of breakfast potatoes. Yum!  It was something different than what you typically see and the flavor palate was just right.Only con is that the good food secret is out and they are usually pretty busy so expect a wait. The drinks are also a tad pricey, the mimosas are served in a regular size champagne glass for a whopping $8."}, {"review_id": "cWPIEDkjxnmNAeyaB_1xeg", "user_id": "FlEbL_nsiGzaK620Sv6zsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Wow can I say the food is worth the wait. We found this place via Yelp and put our names on the list. Started off with a round of local drafts, Maytag chips and deviled eggs. Our group of 3 loved them and the variety on the menu. Which is why we decided to stop here. There is definitely something for everyone. I got the Mac and cheese with burnt end which was huge but definitely worth a shot. The others ordered the burnt end and brick House sandwiches. We all had leftovers to take home.

Immediately greeted for drink orders. I went out in a limb and got the Pickled Tink. Basically vodka with their house made pickle juice. Shockingly not terrible! It's more of a sweet pickle, like the ones your grandma makes. For dinner I got the good ol BK classic. Your simple burger with tomatoes and pickles and \"special sauce\" and of course sweet potatoes fries. The mini size is definitely enough. My friend got the Brick-house burger which he said was fantastic. I believe it had bacon and some house made chips on it. He ordered the small truffle fries which was too much, he couldn't finish them all after the burger.

The Rueben is one of my favorites in town, texture was fabulous and so was the flavor. The truffle fries were great with two sauces. The fried artichokes were very good as well.

That's a bummer because I had a great experience so I'm going to tell ya'll about it now!We were seated immediately on a chilly Monday night. The manager of the night came over to welcome me and my friend at our table and gave us a few starter suggestions. Let me reiterate how much I love it when waitresses/hosts make honest recommendations! She had us order the ancho cheese dip. The bread crumbs and seasoning were the MVPs of this Tex-Mex dish. I ordered the American Kobe burger ($13) which came with shiitake mushrooms and a...wait for it.....deep fried ball of goat cheese. Much clogged arteries. Such wow. If you're gonna throw down with this juicy burger, make sure to pair it with a mini/small order of the parmesan truffle fries ($4.50). My friend ordered the chicken & waffles which tastes as good as it smells coming out of the kitchen. Prepare to get smacked in the face with that wafting maple aroma. It's legit. There's also a large beer selection here that they have listed on one of their walls so make sure to take your time and try out some local drafts!"}, {"review_id": "f2c-7Fh1PsnzAKVRQkbOAg", "user_id": "sxG8mCAr6aN3nIcOpK3Weg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Got the brick house burger and it was sooo good!

The menu has a plethora of options, and their fries with the different seasonings and ketchup flavors are to die for. Flavors of ketchup?? Sounds odd, but I'm not kidding when I say that have an Old School Ketchup (classic), Whiskey BBQ, and Smokey Chipotle (my favorite). Their whole theme revolves around beer, hence the name, and they have old beer taps hanging from the ceiling. The only downside about the restaurant is that they do not take reservation and can often be busy during dinner or on weekends; however, I would not let that deter you and definitely make this restaurant a place to try.My favorite option on the menu is creole chicken burger with sweet potato fries on the side which is always cooked to perfection. Many of my friends also rave about their mac & cheese which is a build your own option that can include different toppings such as bacon. For late night eats, this restaurant has a fantastic happy hour menu that is worth the money. Though they do not serve burgers late night, they have flatbreads, fries, and hummus as an option from 11PM - 1AM Friday and Saturday. Additionally, they have their happy hour menu available from 4PM - 6PM every day with the same deals that are $5 and below. Another bonus about the restaurant is that they have a fantastic brunch menu! Their brunch is available on the weekend, and I would highly recommend calling in to see what their wait time is when you are planning to go. Definitely a brunch worth waiting! They have options such as red velvet waffles, chicken and waffles, and eggs benedict. This past weekend, I brought my friends from out of town, and I ordered their spinach mushroom omelette and potatoes and requested egg white. My friends ordered the chicken and waffles and pork belly and waffles and devoured their meals. The only downside was that the pork belly and waffles was served with whiskey syrup and appeared to have a strong alcohol content. If you are not into that, I would recommend asking for a regular maple syrup.Hopefully, these experiences show you why I'm absolutely obsessed with this restaurant! At any time of day, it has many food and drink options that are always delicious and so this is a place that should definitely be at the top of your restaurant list when exploring KC."}, {"review_id": "Ec9r-PYLBKS4sjHwNkjZ0Q", "user_id": "aUnbWfMAVyfVsDPVuxTOrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "Went to Beer Kitchen for my 30th birthday.
