It was a dinner for 2 to celebrate my wife's birthday. I made the reservation about a month out through opentable. I was a little nervous because booking through an app can be hit or miss. I did mention my wife's bday in the notes. We arrived early, I wouldn't recommend doing that on a Saturday night. I'll explain in a minute. We were greeted promptly and upon giving my name the host wished my wife a happy birthday and another one complimented her air (nice). We were asked to wait in the bar. The bar staff were very professional, but the bar area is small and the seating is limited on a busy night. Honestly this is the only real negative I have (and its hardly a negative). The bar was busy. We placed our orders and were given comp champagne or sparkling wine for our wait. Our table was ready on time. Very nice location so we were pleased. We allowed the staff to walk us through the menu and both chose to do the 4 course pairing with wines. I highly recommend. Here are the highlights: Lobster soup paired with sherry. Unbelievable. Crawfish over fried green tomatoes with a white wine. Very good. Seared scallop. I wanted to cry when I finished eating it. It was that good. Foie gras \"BLT\". All I can say is it is now my life's mission to eat Foie gras every day. The duck paired with a red. So f$&king good. There were other dishes I just can't remember them. It was a blur of deliciousness. I don't know much about fine dining, but I do know a lot about eating and having an emotional response to very good food. This place was tops. Easily the most expensive dinner I've ever personally paid for (with tip over $500 for 2) but we have ZERO regrets. It was fantastic. Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "Trrd-W3-UD4R-VILc7SeFQ", "user_id": "ZgC8zRVxGS037XVBP05jLQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "UPDATED:To the credit of this restaurant--a credit I take seriously--the management reached out to me to apologize. Not everyone by any means is that good. I have to commend the management for their oversight. It takes a lot of people to run a restaurant. 99% may do their jobs perfectly, but the 1% can ruin the effort. Thank you, Charleston Restaurant, for addressing my review. I appreciate it greatly.OLD REVIEW:Don't go. I was sorry from the moment I walked in the door until the moment I left. When I walked in, my fiancee and I were wearing regular shoes because we went from the Harbor Court Hotel to the Baltimore Aquarium to the restaurant. When we walked in, the Maitre D, looked at my shoes and said \"I take it you have not been here before.\" I go to Michelin-starred restaurants all the time and I know when I am seated in the proverbial \"Siberia.\" Charleston will never have even one Michelin star.I also noticed that in the backroom, \"Siberia,\" my fiancee and I were seated with minorities in traditional garb. I don't believe this was an accident. Those in charge of seating have a bias. I ordered the tasting menu. Badly composed. Every dish was rich with no break in between courses. Even the \"salad\" was hot and rich and I ordered it because I could see the problem in the menu coming and hoped to avoid it. No luck. A tactless, ill-thought place to eat."}, {"review_id": "pahUAUqGpickMvoAgMtoAg", "user_id": "kQrQKFmvRxuGXPyzk9W3_A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Arugula oil galore!

Every person we came in contact with just seemed a cut above your average person, almost aristocratic without the snootiness. The \"open kitchen\" environment is very cool, even the bathroom was really nice. We were just shocked at how bland every single course was, even the sauces drizzled with each plate had little flavor.  It's a shame since each course was well made at its base, it simply lacked any kind of seasoning.  As a result each of the wine pairings were spectacular since it was the most flavorful thing on the table and stood out above the food."}, {"review_id": "hFH1izwkur1HEMjCLGz51A", "user_id": "hKAelF9K5XSL9bjQO7PpIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "This has been the best Baltimore restaurant I've been to so far.

We'd been planning to go at some point while in Baltimore and I'm glad we've checked this off our food list. The place is gorgeous. It has this old-school fancy feel.They sat us close to the open kitchen, so we could see all the dishes as they were brought out. The chef even stopped by our table to check on our meal. Service was great but not overbearing. Water glasses and bread plates were never left empty (unless we wanted them to be). Onto the food: excellent. We each went with the 3-dish option that includes dessert ($79 each) and were stuffed by the end. The meal includes a small starter (biscuit and soup) as well as dessert. We loved the lobster soup and shrimp and grits, two of their staples. I was also impressed by the tuna tartar special, which was flown in fresh that day. My main nit pick is that I didn't love the flavor of the beef tenderloin. It was one of hubby's picks and he was impressed, so I won't dock points for that. I'm not usually a fan of dessert but since it was included we ordered the passionfruit creme brulee and walnut espresso cake, which were both good. Everyone also gets complimentary mini macarons and bonbons. All in all, we had a great experience. If you're in Baltimore and don't mind the price tag, give it a shot."}, {"review_id": "-Xut79eeGNr_RPqUUWX53g", "user_id": "fUguDPcgQ-uDVMUe0G5weA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/5/2017", "text": "Charleston has been on my Baltimore restaurant bucket list since I moved here in 2008. I'm not sure what took me so long to get here because everything was amazing and the service was impeccable. I was pleasantly surprised with the fact that Charleston wasn't stuffy. I was expecting to feel slightly out of place and young, but that wasn't the case at all. Chef Cindy Wolf actually makes it a point to visit the tables of everyone in the dining room to make them feel at home. I really appreciated this and it was lovely to chat with her for a few minutes.Charleston is one of the six Foreman Wolf restaurants in Baltimore and unsurprisingly, I was as much a fan here as I have been elsewhere.You have the option to order as many courses as you like and dessert is complimentary. Well, my friend and I opted to order four courses each and share the dishes (because everything looked so amazing). First, Chef sent out an order of complimentary Fried Oysters. These were light, came with a lemon-cayenne mayonnaise and weren't chewy in the slightest. It was a great bite to start the meal.Chef also sent out a portion of Artichoke Soup with a Gruyere Pastry. I had never had artichoke soup before, it was so creamy and had a nice strong artichoke flavor which I loved. The pastry was subtly cheesy and incredible.One of the dishes that Chef is known for is the Rich Lobster Soup with Curry. This was probably my favorite bite of the night. The creamy broth was slightly spicy from the curry, but not at all overpowering. And it was rich without being too much. It was also served with a healthy portion of butter poached lobster.We also ordered the Prime Beef Steak Tartare. With capers, shallots, Tabasco, and chives the dish was a nice balance of savory and salty. I'm a sucker for steak tartare and this was another great rendition.One of my other favorite bites was the Fresh Chanterelle Mushroom Sable Tart. A buttery, cheesy tart was topped with snail butter (OMG), and tender mushrooms. We wanted to lick our plates clean when we finished this dish.Another highly recommended dish was the Shrimp and Grits. The buttery thick grits had a nice salty-bacon-y taste from the ham and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. We could not get enough of the grits in this dish.Because it's summer, we couldn't turn down the Local Sweet Corn Flan. Corn is one of my favorite summer veggies and during the height of the season it's even better. The corn was so sweet and paired nicely with the carrot puree and roasted beets. While not as light as a salad, this veggie forward dish was a great way to break up the meal.The Risotto was also recommended to me so we made sure to order that as well. The preparation when we visited contained artichokes and I was a huge fan of the meaty artichoke bites intermingled with the risotto.As we moved through the menu, we also opted to try the Pan-Roasted Wild Halibut. It was cooked perfectly - so flaky. And the lemon beurre blanc was buttery and fantastic. The fish held up to the sauce well and with the mushrooms. It was such a lovely bite.I'm a sucker for buffalo, so I couldn't turn down the Grilled Hawkeye Ranch Buffalo Tenderloin. The meat was so tender and the fried green tomato added some nice textural contrast and the tomato chimichurri gave this dish a pop of freshness. But the veal reduction may have been the star of this dish. Similarly to every other sauce we tried, it was fantastic.Dessert is included with the tasting menu and I was really craving a chocolately bite. I went with the Chocolate Mousse Cake. The cake was chocolately and it was the perfect ending to any meal, but the real standout was the spearmint ice cream. It was so refreshing and I don't think I'll be able to look at mint ice cream the same going forward.We also shared the Vanilla Bean Poached Local Peaches and Raspberry Meringue to capitalize on the flavors of summer. The peaches were so tender so they played nicely with the crunch from the merangue. This was probably one of the best seasonal forward desserts I've had all summer.Vanilla Bean Poached Local Peaches and Raspberry MeringueWhile we were selecting our dessert options, our waiter picked up on our interest to try the Passion Fruit Creme Brûlée and brought it out for us. This was unlike any creme brûlée I have ever had. The passion fruit cut the sweetness of this dessert and the pineapple sorbet on the top was the star."}, {"review_id": "pOOBin5te-afCsVNXw6anA", "user_id": "LK2cFPrCgHc8shHfG1bN-w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "As a fine dining employee and as someone who is not foreign to dining out at high-end restaurants, I was not overly impressed with Charleston given its grandiose reputation. While nothing was \"bad\" per say, the food lacked the extra wow-factor that we expected and paid for, but service and atmosphere were wonderful! To start, we were politely greeted by the hostess and coat check and was sat within minutes (on a Saturday night) on a ironed table clothed table (yes, they iron it!). Our friendly, sassy (in a good way) waiter offered us drinks from the bar without giving us a chance to look over the drink list. At first we felt rushed, but was later remediated when plenty of time was given between courses. Cocktails were delicious and wine list was extensive. We opted for the 6 course menu option with several great recommendations from our waiter. The oysters (raw and fried, we had both) lacked some flavor, but I was impressed with how plump and not overly-fried the crispy oysters were. I also thought the beef tartare was a little bland. The lobster bisque was rich and yummy, and the ceviche was one of my favorites along with the foie gras. Lastly, I was a bit disappointed with the lamb chop- it's my favorite dish at any restaurant. Here, it wasn't trimmed and had way too much fat on the bone that it was overpowering. Normally, the fat makes the flavor. To end our ambitious dinner, we were offered a cheese course, which we took because why not! We weren't informed it was extra, in fact our waiter mentioned pre-meal that we would have the option of cheese and dessert in the end. We were almost full to our ears so we only got a small slice of 2 cheeses- $16! Whatever, I wasn't paying (; And to top off our full bellies, dessert and coffee was small and a decadent end to the night. The next morning, I experienced symptoms of food poisoning - I'll spare the details. Though I haven't confirmed that the restaurant food is the culprit, I've deduced that the other meals I had that day could not have been. I contacted the restaurant to make them aware and got a satisfactory response in return. Overall, I wouldn't return based on price versus food return (our bill was over $300 for 2), but I am glad I visited here - it was a great experience."}, {"review_id": "05I7DBRaUbnnvTe_MXq7_w", "user_id": "UfFeAD8oFT-BrHGiXsd-fw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Peter is Awesome!

I'm sure many of us have had fois gras, scallops, seafood soup (in this case their lobster soup is a star on the menu) and other decadent items on occasions, but to have an entire meal of great ingredients mastered/respected with expert techniques is really what makes this place stand out.The price is the only prohibitive aspect of dining at this restaurant, but do note the service, in addition to the food/wine is amazing/attentive and that's what you're partially paying for as well.

While the service was as attentive and thoughtful as I would expect from an establishment of this caliber, the food ultimately fell disappointingly short. I do like how they have a build-your-own tasting menu, and I opted for 3 courses for $79, which is the smallest course you can choose. The professional service was apparent from the moment I walked into the door. They took our coats, I was offered a shawl (a very nice, soft one at that) in case I got cold as well as a cushion for my back when I sat down. Throughout the meal, the service was attentive and polite. Nothing to complain about in that department. But again, the food was unfortunately the downfall of my experience. 1. We started the meal with an amuse bouche of a small cup of soup (forgot what exactly it was). It was not bad, although my boyfriend commented that it reminded him of vomit, and once he said that, I started noticing the acidity of the soup. But again, not bad. 2.5/5 stars.2. They then came around with some free bread - I chose the cornbread and olive bread bun. This was the first red flag - the bread was inexcusably dry and hard. I'm normally a sucker for free bread but I literally took a bite of each and didn't even bother with the rest. 1/5 stars.3. My first course was the Prime Beef Steak Tartare (Capers, Shallots, Tabasco, Chives, Olive Bread Toast). This was probably my favorite course of the meal - the meat was well seasoned and flavorful. However, I will say that it was neither particularly memorable nor creative - it tasted like something I could get at any other restaurant. 3.5/5 stars.4. Fine, there's only so much creativity you can incorporate into tartare. Plus, I was looking forward to my second course - Pan Roasted Sea Scallop - because scallops are one of my favorite foods! The scallop was prepared okay - the sear wasn't as strong as I like it to be which means it was missing that nice, crispy exterior. It was topped with what was essentially sliced bacon (of course, there was a fancier name for it on the menu) which I thought was texturally incompatible with the scallop - the chewiness of it really took away from the softness of the scallop. Finally, the scallop was placed on top some kind of cauliflower mash... pretty flavorless. 2.5/5 stars.5. Okay, there's one last course which means it can be the saving grace of this meal! I opted for the Veal Tenderloin with Lobster Medallion. The lobster was literally just lobster - relatively tough and flavorless, and the veal (I asked for it medium rare) came almost well-done which is really inexcusable. Also, the food came out luke-warm. My least favorite course of the entire meal and a poor way to end the three courses. 1/5 stars.Fortunately, the meal came with dessert and we opted for the Sticky Toffee Pudding (Cherry & Fonseca Port Compote, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream). Not bad in flavor but the breading was really dry. They also provided some complimentary bonbons, caramels, and meringues, which were pretty good. 1.5/5 and 4/5 stars, respectively.All in all I'm very confused - the food I got was mediocre at best, and to be entirely honest, even if I had been served the same thing at a restaurant without the name (and even if it was cheaper), I would still be disappointed. Some things may have been an issue with preference, but things like serving my veal well-done when I asked for it medium rare is not okay. Maybe I went on a bad evening? The stellar reviews and the \"name value\" of this restaurant makes me hope that is the case."}, {"review_id": "Q2E6hQjUbzGLjwDdZpSPPw", "user_id": "vBpFBA14DQ5j1dDUtUYQ8Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Can't get behind this place. Was excited and had high expectations from everyone we spoke with. My husband and I regularly eat out at fine restaurants but the whole experience felt like an imitation, including the food. The Charleston bills itself as a fine dining restaurant and charges the same price as other restaurants in DC or NYC but lacks in service and especially in food. It's just not worth it.To start, we pulled up and had valet right away. When we walked into the restaurant we ended up in the hallway with other couples just standing and waiting for a hostess to greet us. We made reservations so it was weird to just stand around without being greeted. We were brought to our table and our server seemed nervous and distracted the whole time. Dish after dish, it all was good but was missing that special ooph. The wines didn't come out at the same time as some dishes. The seating is very tight and tables very close to one another.  I hate to say it but the food was underwhelming. The lobster bisque was good but a tad too salty. The tuna tartare was good but definitely not memorable. I've had better tuna tartare at sushi restaurants for less. When you come out looking for fine dining you're catering to a clientele that actively goes out to be entertained, surprised by the food. It justifies the cost and the experience. The Charleston sadly did not meet that for me.
