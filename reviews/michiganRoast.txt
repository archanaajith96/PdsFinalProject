Again, I wish there were half stars. The service was excellent. Outstanding actually.I ordered the Hanger Steak, medium. To be honest, I was a bit disappointed.  The marinade was a bit overpowering  and I found the meat tough. I was talked into this dish as I was going to order the lamb shank. I got to taste the lamb from a friend who ordered it and I immediately regretted my choice. The lamb would have pushed a four star.Had the wild mushrooms as a side and enjoyed the whole evening. The steak just ruined it for me, especially at the price.Having said that, the restaurant was excellent overall and I would eat here again."}, {"review_id": "WDPxi6jscsBcrDCBdWxAiw", "user_id": "SnkWRWDk_tPVcyAMeNwbkg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "This restaurant is absolutely what I expect of a high quality steak restaurant. We started with the mussels and fries. The mussels were cooked perfectly tender in a super savory red pepper sauce  and topped with thin crispy fries and a garlic aioli. It was very satisfying and filling for an appetizer. For the main, I had their dried aged ribeye. It was exactly how I liked it! Perfectly charred and seasoned on the outside with marbling throughout. It was topped with an acidic onion slaw to balance out the fattiness. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable and every staff that came to our table was friendly and very conversational. The only off encounter I had was with one of the hostesses. Our reservation was for 5:00pm and we arrived at 4:58pm. She refused to seat us...another hostess politely stepped in and seated us promptly. That same hostess who wouldn't seat us 2 min before opening time also told me to the use the hotel bathrooms outside of the restaurant when I inquired on where the bathrooms were located...I realized later there were bathrooms inside the restaurant to the left of the bar. Just thought that was odd.Overall, solid restaurant, will definitely return for the food."}, {"review_id": "Qd638OUYcZQP2d-KJ8nMAw", "user_id": "r8jAojQ5RaubH810WLSVPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I hesitate to say that if you've been to one Michael Symon restaurant, you have been to them all.

My friend and I came down here for restaurant week and it exceeded my expectations. I booked a reservation for 5:00pm right when they open. We had some time to kill so we went around The Westin riding up and down the elevators. When it was exactly 5pm we walked through the glass doors and checked in we waited about 5 minutes for our table to be ready and were seated in a a booth where my friend and I both got a booth seat instead of one booth and one chair. I really liked this. This place is elegant without being arrogant. The lighting is dim and adds to the ambiance. The restaurant is decorated in warm tones and has a romantic feel to it. There were a lot of choices on the restaurant week menu and I decided on muscles, steak and the bar for dessert. The sides were al a carte and my friend and I decided to split the brussel sprouts and polenta. The muscles came served with crispy and tasty French fries on top and a dollop of a yellow sauce whose taste I couldn't place well enough to identify but it was delicious. The muscles were served with a meat broth on the bottom which was very tasty both by itself and even better when you dipped the house bread in it. The hanger steak was one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was charred on the outside and melt in your mouth on the inside. The pickled chili really added something unique and unexpected to the dish. The brussel sprouts were magical and I'd come back here for just them. I've never tasted any brussel sprouts quite like them. The polenta had a perfect texture and creamy taste. I tried the two together and the two together offered another intense and delicious flavor combination. The bar dessert was sweet, crunchy and salty. It had chocolate on top with a toffee bottom caramel sauce on the bottom with a toasted marshmallow and chocolate cookie shavings. Everything about this meal was fantastic."}, {"review_id": "rLffze6rqbuksXANmieKKA", "user_id": "HRC0R4mQGJqpfQ0PvLCC_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "We were a party of 8 during Detroit restaurant week. For a high end restaurant, I would rate service a five and the food a three. Our waitress was amazing and there were multiple people refilling water glasses and clearing plates. I was very impressed with the service. The food was just meh. We started with sliced baguette and whipped butter which were both amazing. Very chewy crust that wasn't overly thick. I had the wine pairing with white bean soup, hanger steak with feta and blue cheese spinach au gratin and the bar for dessert. The wine pairings were ok. The white wine (Marques de Irun) with its citrusy notes didn't go well with the white bean soup. The soup itself had a creamy texture, fully blended with no whole beans. I would have preferred remnants of beans to thin out the soup, which was very thick. The hanger steak wasn't served very warm, still very tender though when served medium. The Malbec was full of tannins and paired well with the leaner cut of hanger steak. My spinach au gratin was very salty and I couldn't eat much of it. Another person's spinach tasted amazing though and we finished hers.  I also tried the Brussel sprouts (amazing!), tri color carrots (a bit sour tasting), and Mac n cheese (bad, undercooked cavatappi and very dry sauce).The bar dessert was a toffee and chocolate concoction with pretzel pieces accompanied with a toasted marshmallow, cookie crumbs and salted caramel sauce. It was too rich and sweet for my tastebuds and the sherry wine pairing was very musky and nutty and too dry with the dessert. The moscato that came with the sorbet was amazing though."}, {"review_id": "HgKIMekaBmQZ60NWLgXqDg", "user_id": "rr5zzVWVu0u-P5P1rHIV-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "4.5/5 so I will round up to 5.Seven other Yelpers and I went here tonight for the first night of Detroit Restaurant Week. Roast was offering a three-course menu for $39. I had never been before and was excited to try it out because I had heard good things about it.Valet is $12, normally $20, and you have to get a stamp from the hostesses at Roast so that they know it's the discounted $12. I opted to do that rather than park somewhere else and walk, and although it was a bit expensive, it was definitely convenient. As you enter the restaurant, there was a coat check, which was also convenient since it's currently winter here in Michigan.I started off with the apple salad, which was okay except it included bitter greens which are not my favorite. For my entree, I had the steak, which was fabulous. What they don't mention on the restaurant week menu is that all of the sides are a la carte; I saw this on their regular menu but figured that for restaurant week a side would be included. A friend and I split the whipped potatoes, which were fine but nothing special. Other friends got the Brussels sprouts, which were very tasty, as well as some heirloom carrots and wild mushrooms. Out of all of those I would recommend the Brussels sprouts the most.For dessert, I got The Bar, which was very tasty - it included some sort of toasted marshmallow, with a chocolate bar that kind of tasted like a chocolate covered pretzel. The other dessert choice was a sorbet, which my friends said was good but not great.With me drinking only water, the bill for three courses plus tip and tax was about $52, which is not bad. If you wanted to splurge, they also have a good cocktail menu and a wine pairing for each course. I definitely want to come back here another time for happy hour, if you sit at the bar they have half-off bar bites.Waitservice was also very efficient and my water glass was always full ... they even topped it off when it was about three-quarters full each time. Overall, I was very impressed with Roast and will return at some point."}, {"review_id": "rzYzc8o6OftGyMQi_MvdNg", "user_id": "QvF97KE8W7vOEUbu6VtGqA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Roast has a wonderful ambience and their service on the floor is impeccable. Front of house service at the hostess stand and coat check was equally great.I came here for the opening night of Detroit Restaurant Week (DRW), and I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the meal service. Then tempo was great, but the flavors did not wow me. - Mussels: All were open, nice and fresh, the sofrito was a bit watery but mind was abundant with chorizo; the same could not be said for my companions.- Beef Cheek Pierogi: Probably my favorite item of the evening. Tender beef with deep flavors put into a thick pierogi remenect of an empanada but pan fried.- Hanger steak: Given the cut the server suggest medium vs. medium rare as I enjoy. That was good advise; the steak was tender and perfectly salted to me. The razor thin sliced chilies of some kind added a zesty note to the meaty steak. - Mushrooms (side): Deep caramelization on this, hard to recognize them against the background of the black cast iron skillet they came on. Nicely done and paired with the steak. - Mac and Cheese (Side): NopeDrinks were excellent; I loved my perfect hendricks martini up with a twist."}, {"review_id": "07DFNMPhMOu_7VVG3XVoYg", "user_id": "Ecq3Ok5lw8GE38BV71Iwyw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Service was great, food was great, prices on par for the course but compared to some other local spots a littttttle bit in the high side.The ambience is pretty cool, the wait staff is one of the most attentive I have ever had and my water stayed full (huuuuuuge deal!).

Like a finely tuned machine.I was actually looking around for someone to refill my water and when I looked down it was already refilled. I started questioning my sanity at this point. Either they have water ninjas working here or I am a loon.And to all the gentlemen & women who put napkins on your laps and get up mid meal to use the restroom, by the time you return the wait staff has picked up and folded your napkin into some fancy shape for you.I know water and napkins sound quite stupid but first everyone has already talked about the food. You know its good! But I just wanted to  show the attention to detail and amount of thought that is put into not only the food but the dining experience as a whole.It seems like Roast has read the reviews, done their surveys and responded to everything that makes customers happy.The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is more of a personal preference for me but when I go to any restaurant charging $50+ for a steak I personally expect someone to come out with a tray of raw meat for me to choose rather than just have a mystery cut given to you. Literally just my personal preference and I am sure if I remmebered to ask they would have accommodated my request.All-in-all, the foods on point, service is great and the water ninjas are a huge plus especially with a restaurant of this size!"}, {"review_id": "_JDOhUVul8Xli2vjxJJDfA", "user_id": "qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "I came here for Detroit Restaurant week with 7 other Yelpers and I have to say, it was a very pleasant experience.  I have eaten Micheal Symon's food before at B Spot burgers and know he's a very popular chef.  Parking is tight in this part of town, so you can either valet and get it validated, park on the street, or do what I did and park at Greektown Casino and take the people mover in to save a ton of $$.I reviewed the menu before hand, for both Restaurant week and the regular menu and they both seem to have a awesome selection of meats and other foods.In regards to ambiance, I love how the place is decorated.  Lots of floor to ceiling windows, great open seating with space to move around, and pleasant relaxing lighting to help you relax and unwind.  Staff here is professional and nice, which I would expect at a nice place like this.For my meal, I went with the Soup, Steak and Sorbet for restaurant week.  I can't remember what kind of soup it was, but it was okay.  Micheal Symon tends to be a bit of a \"different\" type of cook then what I am used to, and his food doesn't always hit the spot for me.  But, I liked it. I didn't love it, but I did enjoy it none the less.The steak was good, but was quite seasoned and a tad salty.  It was still good though. They did serve a plate of bread and butter before hand which was good, but the bread was crunchy, and I was surprised at that. Don't ask why, but I prefer softer bread myself. Fine.The sorbet was really good, and not to overpowering.  It's one of the longer dinners that I have sat through, which is fine by me because I think that's part of the experience dining at a nicer place like this.  you want to sit and enjoy your company, the food and not feel rushed. I think I would have been angry if I felt rushed considering it seems to be about $75, more like $100 a person for dinner here.  I would *hope* that they weren't trying to push me out! Whole thing ran a bit over 2 hours, which is fine for me.Overall, I enjoyed myself here and had a great sampling of their menu.  Happy with everything, and would encourage people to stop back in and try it again.  Service here is spot on, and I was happy that things did move smoothly.  Places were cleared in a timely manner, water was always full, waitress made sure we were all okay, etc."}, {"review_id": "xJwr6sX_qkoooIyDoHz3_g", "user_id": "zt7QrHk0yipWgglzHYO8vQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "I love happy hour, and Roast is perhaps one of the most established happy hour spots in Downtown Detroit. With all of the new and awesome places popping up, you can still count on Roast to be delicious, friendly, and overall perfect for chatting it up with friends between 4:00-6:30 p.m. M-F. Happy Hour is only served at the bar, and Roast has one of the most comfortable and classy bars in the city. There was plenty of room for my friend and I when we arrived around 6:00 on a Monday.In true Michael Symon fashion, the bar menu brings meaty offerings. In fact, the bar menu that's currently on the website is not exactly the same as the menu from which we ordered, because there were several additional offerings including a daily special. During happy hour, there was a $5.00 craft draft beer (Kuhnhenn's Fluffer for our visit) $5.00 rose wines (two to choose from), and $5.00 well drinks. In addition, the bar menu offerings were half-off.So, we settled on mussels and tacos, and drinks. The mussels were absolutely to die for! They were perfectly steamed in a delicious chorizo and sofrito broth that I couldn't help but mop up with my tacos before taking a bite. Definitely tied for best Detroit mussels in my book. The tacos were also superb, and deliciously balanced in flavor and texture. The portions are not at all tiny, they are perfect for sharing or enough for a meal if you're very hungry. We couldn't end the night without dessert, and oh-my-gosh - what an amazing dessert it was. \"The Bar\" - chocolate, marshmallow, whiskey caramel, cream cheese pretzel ice cream. Again, perfect portion for sharing, and everything was beyond tasty - the whiskey caramel paired with the dark chocolate, and the cream cheese pretzel ice cream weren't like anything I've had before. I do love Roast for a great happy hour. I have yet to dine off the dinner menu, but I am a huge fan of Symon's restaurants in Cleveland, especially the now-closed Lolita - I miss it, and maybe they'll open Lolita Detroit."}, {"review_id": "Kb3mrIq-18Sj2WuI9EUzHQ", "user_id": "DaX2SwlVMCLjKO9nDqsClw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "LOVED this restaurant.

But for the money, I need to be more impressed.Steakhouse. You can glean from my reviews how much I dislike steakhouses, but this was BF's pick. We were looking for an xmas eve dinner spot, but my mom vetoed this menu as \"too fancy\" (ironic because the menu was way simpler than at the place we ended up). But when I was discussing this hilarious statement with BF his eyes lit up and said \"OMG are you talking about Roast?? I've wanted to go there for ages!\" So, we went.It's super-conveniently located in downtown Detroit. If it wasn't so cold we would have milled around a bit. It's in a hotel, so thankfully had valet, which the restaurant validates, so it was fairly inexpensive to park. The decor is beautiful, modern, leather chairs, hella dark. Service was fine.We had cocktails to start, and the drink menu was presented on an iPad, which was a unique experience. BF had a spin on fancy eggnog and I had a citrusy tequila cocktail which was refreshing.We shared a special potato soup (which the kitchen was kind enough to split into 2 portions), garnished with crispy potatoes, and it was easily to best savory course of the night. That annoys me because $50 steak. We also shared the beef cheek pierogis, which we thought would be much more saucy and interesting than they were, and were sort of dry.BF had the NY strip with bone marrow and pesto. He enjoyed it, loves marrow, and is easy to please. He wasn't blown away, but the portion was big enough to make 2 meals of. I had a few bites, and the steak was perfectly cooked, but not stupendously flavored. We also ordered a side of the wild mushrooms, which seemed to be mostly chanterelles and were tougher than chanterelles should be. They were fine, not great, and not the enormous portion we expected given the scale of steakhouse dinner.I had the smoked pork chop with polenta, BBQ onions, and pickled chilies. The dish was more like tougher pork loin medallions, which worked for me since I'm not a huge pork chop fan. But I liked everything else on the plate more than the pork which was a bit dry. The polenta and sauce were lovely and creamy, and I wish there was more on the plate given the enormous portion of meat (most of which I took home and gave to my mom). The onions tasted sautéed but not so much BBQed, and I also would have appreciated more of them. The pickled chilies were okay, but I wanted more acid and less heat.The pastry chef is the MVP of this place, as the desserts were far and away the best things we ordered. BF secretly told the staff it was my birthday (a few days early), so they made my dessert (the bar) special with a candle and note, which was really nice. It was outstanding in every respect. Creamy dense chocolate, a freshly-made marshmallow, fantastic caramel. I ordered BF the thinny mint, since he's a mint lover, and it was also fabulous. Reminiscent of a midcentury icebox cake napoleon. I would order both again a million times.Frankly, I'd just come here for dessert and soup and leave happier (and with more money)."}, {"review_id": "IuX2pKuiG2nauvCTQ70MQA", "user_id": "a8RPIAPnLjwZhYxYY-8_zg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "What a way to start off DRW than with a handful of Elite Yelpers at the same table. I was a little nervous coming to Roast, primarily because I do not know the area well and was very nervous about the parking situation. Fortunately, they have valet parking that you can have validated at the front prior to being seated at Roast, this brings your valet from $20 to $12.  Dinner reservations were made ahead of time so that was very convenient. The entrance is elegant, the employees are a top notch attentive, they have coat check (winning). The decor is classy and the ambiance is romantic not that boujee and uppity.  The menu choices were all screaming try me, try me.  Roast was one of the more eye catching menus for DRW in my opinion.  I opted for the mussels and fries as an appetizer which came in a wine sauce.  The mussels hand chunks of chorizo at the bottom and the sauce was enough to make this a two-fer.  I cleared my dish of the fries and passed them on down the table.  Dug out all the mussels and made this into a soup of sorts. This ended up being very tasty as the mussels had time to marinate in the sauce with the chorizo chunks. Next was the entree, I opted for the scallops with arugula and bacon. My scallops were cold and slightly underwhelming. I ate most of them.  I also had the spinach and feta au-gratin, which was delicious! Perfect pairing and perfect amount of spinach to cheese ratio! Our table was full of YE, so we passed around all of our add ons and what a treat this was.  I had the carrots which for some they loved for me they were certainly interestingly tart, not terrible but new and my pallet was confused. The Brussels sprouts, ohhhhh these were my second favorite of the night! They had a crispiness paired with a red wine tasting flavor almost like they sat in a wine bath and then seared in bacon grease! Let's just say you are missing out on this dish if you haven't tried it.  I also ordered a cocktail, not something I usually do but I was interested.  I ended up ordering the drink called \"No Name\", it means a drink this good it doesn't need a name.  I thought that would be interesting so I ordered it and BOY did my taste buds thank me for that! This drink alone is worth a trip back! Not even kidding! This is a twist on the Moscow Mule and I couldn't have been more wow'ed with just the drink alone. On to the dessert, I opted for the mango sorbet, which was nothing I raved about.  The sorbet was more sweet than tart and the flavor of the cookie they paired it with didn't add any wow factors to the dish, so it was a miss for me. Our server was 100% attentive.  She was informative, patient, and friendly.  Definitely, what you expect at a place like this. Plates were removed promptly and our glasses stayed full! Overall, this is a place that warrants a return, certainly for the cocktail and the brussels sprouts.Only bummer was I wish I lived closer!"}, {"review_id": "8QffHU0ui11gDkfG3xgViQ", "user_id": "HzqfrgSrnqcsRI2dOWtubA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "It is a rarity in my book to give a 5-star review especially for a location that is typically perceived as a five-star just because of concept or name alone.

I have been here a few times and have not had a bad experience yet. I recently went with a few friends and we all had a great time.I enjoyed the filet for my dinner with mashed potatoes. They both were prepared perfectly. The steak was done a little on the rarer side, I think that is how they prepare all of their meats. I ordered a medium rare steak and it came out closer to rare. I enjoyed that and the seasoning was good. One of the best parts about the steak was that it was just olive oil and sea salt on the meat and brought to me. I do enjoy just eating the meat for what it is without all the extra stuff added on to them. Of course you can get a topping that includes crab. My wife got the ribeye, that was a good steak as well. Those meats are on the fattier side, so they will have a bit more flavor to them. I paired my meal with a few glasses of red wine. (Sorry, I can't remember what the name of it was) The red wine was perfect with the meat. I think the wine helped break down the taste and meat in your mouth so it was easier to not only digest but taste all the flavors that each item supplied. (I guess, I'm being too technical) We did not get desert here but from the looks of what others got around me they looked great. I would have opted for the apple desert.
