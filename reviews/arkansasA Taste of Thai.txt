They not only have a great rice but they keep bringing you rice. I hate being limited on rice, especially when it's good rice.  I tend to end up getting the curry more often than the pad Thai so I can have extra rice.  They even give me extra rice with my left overs."}, {"review_id": "3oYsyu8pSqsID3rHPGyxqQ", "user_id": "fuslIq-ZJCd-qornjEokUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Northwest Arkansas.

I had the most deliciously sweet beef pa-nang curry of my life, as well as the best fried tofu mas-samun curry. Seriously flavorful and saucy. While these seem cheaper than these same dishes at other Thai restaurants, the serving size was a little smaller than I am used to, so no leftovers. Other than the curries, I have only tried the fried spring rolls (nothing special) and the papaya salad, which was extremely acidic and spicy. Not a fan. Those curries, though.

It's a real gem in an area that mostly offers up pizza and university fare. I will not gush about the food- you will read about it in the other reviews I am sure. That's why I've given them 5 stars. Truly authentic- but as soon as you walk in the place you have to appreciate the amazingly ornate and authentic jewel-clustered mirrors and figurines that hang on the walls-all from Thailand and all stunning. Gorgeous! I often order the beef salad in Thai restaurants because it seems like a healthy choice and delicious-but I was amazed by the amount of meat they put in this dish at this place. At least 3 times more than in any other Thai restaurant I have been to. A very friendly and welcoming staff as well."}, {"review_id": "ozE-JbMWluM_e65l18JwnQ", "user_id": "bZMwvWLR84OZ-6gx3Cc_oQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Thai is one of our favorite types of food. We have very good Thai restaurants in Kansas City (I.e. Hot Basil, The Thai Place, Pad Thai, and even Wai-Wai), and have also traveled and eaten through Thailand. We are trying to find a good Thai spot in Fayetteville. The reason A Taste Of Thai gets even two stars is because our server was awesome, super nice, and did a great job! The other star is because they're aware of what gluten is and advertise being able to accommodate for gluten free on their menu. The only thing that a Thai restaurant would have to worry about gluten-wise is soy sauce with gluten in it or hoisin or oyster sauce with gluten in it. Otherwise, Thai food is pretty great for people like my husband with Celiac because coconut milk, fish sauce, and rice are all naturally gluten free. At Thai restaurants that know what gluten is they'll make dishes using gf soy sauce or they'll just tell you that the dish cannot be made gf because they don't have gf soy sauce. At A Taste of Thai we ordered Tom Yum soup and Pad Kee Mao medium spice. Both came out very bland, literally no spice at all, and the Pad Kee Mao was a very small portion for $10.95. The noodles in it were still the same color as in the package because the sauce was so anemic. I think the people working here are very nice, but the food is sadly lacking. Our search continues for the best Thai in Fayetteville. If you too are looking for a great Thai restaurant, I wouldn't recommend this one."}, {"review_id": "y1LwXRTgJns6RxrZltZC0g", "user_id": "HFTCfFSL1znOZtFOb60NDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/21/2017", "text": "Amazingly awesome thai food.

I don't know why I don't go here more often. Maybe because of the parking but the food...Fresh, authentic, love all the curries (esp the red curry). Spice level is 1-5. I ordered 3 & it wasn't spicy (for me). Pad kee Mao is good but the noodles are a little soggy. No Thai meal is complete without sticky rice & mango. The rice was warm & sweet with coconut milk. You can tell the staff works hard to take your order and get your food to the table. You can also eat outside. Bathrooms are out of the restaurant down the hall. This is a hole in the wall and a gem."}, {"review_id": "n231BjLx953LYgDCpeWy5A", "user_id": "Oweb8yykQo2_NVN-vgHPcg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "Best Thai in Fayetteville hands down!!

Everything on the menu is top notch. The only complaints I can really say is about the inside layout and atmosphere. When you walk in, you're in the middle of the restaurant and it's awkward making eye contact with seated guests mid bite. But when the server asks where to sit, you need to request the patio. Their patio is the best. Its the perfect place to relax and enjoy some sake. I highly recommend getting the Chicken Pad Thai with a 4 star spice. Their spice level is not hot compared to other Thai cuisine in the area. For those spice lovers, ask for Thai hot. Honestly, it has the best flavor."}, {"review_id": "QnkIO3Fab8WM7PTiKKcA6A", "user_id": "XBZ7r1RR0MW4xR-FXmB71w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "10/28/2016", "text": "I gave one star because there is no negative.
