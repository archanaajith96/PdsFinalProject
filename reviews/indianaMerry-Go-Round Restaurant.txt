I had a full breakfast for 10 bucks, what a great deal keep up the good work Brittany! The girl deserves a raise she works her butt off, not only did she wait on my table but she was moving around moving the coffee canister and just run around all over the place, if I were her boss I'd give her a raise immediately!It's a good bang for the buck, I recommend this place And the message for the management team, do not change your prices, they're good !"}, {"review_id": "WuVcD3nzgKJCA6ez9yHMzw", "user_id": "CLnufpxD5jxXwTQXPVemIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "I had a morning flight out of Evansville back to Houston. I forgot that I would be crossing time zones on my way to the airport so I ended up having an hour to burn. I love Yelp to be able to find non-chain restaurants while traveling. Merry-Go-Round ranked highly (another one downtown advertised as serving breakfast was closed). I'm so happy for that. This place is really cool! From reading about their history they have been in this location for decades s a family restaurant. The waitstaff really cared about pleasing me. They were quick with the tea refills and the food came out quickly. The place was pretty full of what I think were regulars. The food was excellent so I would imagine its hopping most of the time. Not sure about what is convenient in Evansville but the location was good for my purposes flying out and they didn't make me miss my flight. My server was funny and personable. I wish I could remember her name as well as the lady that checked me out. Everybody was smiling and hustling to keep the customers happy. That's what it's all about. I come through occasionally so this will be a spot to remember."}, {"review_id": "Ikc3AnYF07KOlrCCehsIDg", "user_id": "hX2Mh4zQn17hjVyLrymCOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Not only does this place have great food and great service,  but it's fast and amazingly prices.
