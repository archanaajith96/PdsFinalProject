It was excellent, and at $10 a great price for the amount of food you get. You also get a baklava (I chose pistachio).Half a star lost because it's a bit hectic during the lunch rush. I was one of the last people to secure a seat, a lot of people behind me had to walk around for a bit with their food before getting a seat. Also saw the cashier running food, which significantly slowed the process of getting through the line. Would be better if there was two people at the register at all times during the rush. I will definitely be back! My Lebanese roots were pleased!"}, {"review_id": "56YA--0nYReXVsBTLu1KMA", "user_id": "q6HV38IPIUe8T-JDLxkYSw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "RUDEWe ordered 8 dishes on the phone at around 2PM on 04/05/2018.

I heard all the hype surrounding this restaurant and decided to try it out. Here are my thoughts and observations:- When they're busy it feels crowded.- The ordering system is nonsensical.- I had to wait 45 minuets for my order. - The table space is shared.- My sides (potato salad and baba ghannouj) were excellent. - My entree (lamb kabob) was cold and tasteless. - Oh my God, my mocha cake thing was to die for.- The portions were too small to warrant the price.Overall, there's better options available in the area, especially for the price."}, {"review_id": "NMrpXH5aRilzM8lXY00N-A", "user_id": "8UHs9runhpLgLTSILbg57Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Background: I used to live in Raleigh.  I have eaten many times at both Neomonde locations as well as at Sassool.  I was in town for a meeting at NC State.  I encourage the two people I was joining to eat lunch at Neomonde.   My thought was it would be a perfect place to lunch on the patio.  As always the food was tasty.  The man at the counter was humorless.  He offered minimalist descriptions of the various options in the case and never offered any fresh rolls.  I got the three items from the deli bar platter and an iced tea.  The salad portions were half the size they used to be.  My colleagues were in line ahead of me and the cashier barked at them to get in line at the cash register.  They were waiting for the rolls typically offered with every meal at Neomonde and Sassool.  They got flustered by the rude cashier and left the line knowing that I was picking up the tab.  I complained about the poor service and was me by a cold stare and repeat statement for the amount Of dollars owed for the meals.  This location has lost my future business.  They need to work on welcoming diners and encouraging patrons to enjoy their food and dining experience."}, {"review_id": "K72Fezi7c-wUqMXXnxbU4g", "user_id": "Qnpd09kS05IzWDO6_6NJUQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Not the best service tonight, not easy to understand or be understood by server behind the counter and they were out of a few things we ordered and then were told they didn't have.

I've been to neomonde several times and the Jibni is my favorite item on the menu. It is basically a cheese pizza without sauce; the combimation of cheese and spices is really tasty. They have many vegetarian entrees and sides and I've never had anything that I didn't enjoyVegan: I've had their Falafel Pita and it is quite good, not as good as Jasmine's(just because Jasmine's is spicier and I like that) but still very good. They also have other vegan options, including a lot of sides. I recommend the lentil salad. Gluten-Free: I've had their Grilled Veggie Lasagna which has layers of roasted eggplant instead of pasta. I don't normally like eggplant because of the texture but they do it well here. Nearly all of their sides are labeled as \"wheat-free\" and you can substitute wheat-free wraps as well.Service: The staff here is generally very friendly. I had once had a negative experience with a cashier that prompted the manager to comp our next meal. They really care about customer satisfaction at Neomonde. Recommendations: Neomonde makes a real and successful effort to accommodate diners with dietary restrictions and so I can recommend this restaurant to vegetarians, vegans, and for those with gluten intolerance. I'm unsure about options for those with other food allergies."}, {"review_id": "lS-iA55E2ghjL4PKVfmlCA", "user_id": "jwxvJlG7yBzvK44n4_j0Lw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "I've been a huge fan of Med Deli for almost three decades and have never felt the urge to hoof it out Raleigh to go to Neomonde. A few weeks back my wife and I had to go to Raleigh so we ended up getting lunch at Neomonde. First off the food was totally fine, nothing bad whatsoever. The baba ghanoush was the best I've ever had, the flatbread was solid and the cilantro hummus was really good. The beet salad and the butternut squash/chickpea salad were fine too. That said, the ordering system is straight up stupid. It makes no sense to order, get your food from the salad case/hot bar, get a notification buzzer for your food that has to be cooked and then get in some sort of amorphous line to pay. It was so disorganized that my wife's flatbread was done before we could even pay and the expediter couldn't find us until I stepped out of line to hail him. So yeah, food is fine, definitely not as good as Med Deli or Bosporus, but the logistics for payment are so stupid that I doubt I will ever be back."}, {"review_id": "ywn9mvXXdW_0JTXHnWaohA", "user_id": "rW8dyc7_aNlnOrfwPpmQIg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "The food was absolutely wonderful!  This was my first time eating here and definitely not my last.  Food chalked full of flavor and healthy at that.

Maybe it was not the best time to go but my experience was not very nice. Customer care is seriously lacking here. Despite me being the only person in the line, the server never took time to guide me as to what different combos or options were available. This was despite me asking specifically on how I could order.Well I ended up ordering a pita pizza with one side and while ordering, I was given a tracking device. When I asked her if they expected me to pick up my order when the device buzzed, which is how it works in many places I've been to, the lady at the counter told me that they would bring the food to the table where I keep the tracker.Now I kept waiting for ten minutes and still I don't see my food. At that moment, the lady at the counter calls me out and asks me to pick up the pizza, which, apparently has been sitting there for a while. The pizza was luke warm because of that.After finishing my food, I went on to order some food for take out and found that the lady at the second counter was quite rude. Maybe they get a lot of business and don't care about how they deal with customers anymore."}, {"review_id": "eKGmbUnYZA5CciBm6SHONg", "user_id": "s_wQDqZ6jWu67WtOUCZrww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Neomonde is the best of the best in my opinion. I have loved it since I moved to Raleigh and did some research on Raleigh restaurants.  Everything I have tried has so much flavor. I absolutely love how fresh and healthy their food is. Today I ordered the pick three sides platter with hummus, the kale salad, and mjadarah (rice, lentils, and caramelized onions). The kale salad has raisins, apples, walnuts and a light oil and vinegar dressing. All meals are served with fresh-baked pita bread.  The hummus had the perfect amount of garlic and seasoning. I have tried many items on their menu and never disliked anything! A few of my other favorites include: lasagna, grape leaves, the baklava, lentil salad, and kibbeh. Customer service is excellent! The restaurant is always clean and cozy. Also, there is a store attached with many Mediterranean items to take home.

This is my new go-to in Raleigh, and if you live here and don't know about this place, I don't know what you're doing. Neomonde is producing classic Mediterranean dishes exuding explosions of flavor. They have no shortage of delicious, crisp, and fresh vegetables.I saw \"Neomonde Platter\" on the board and knew this dish wouldn't disappoint! Tabouli, hummus, baba ghanouj, grape leaves, labneh, EVOO, olives, and I was blown away. It also came with freshly baked pita bread. This place doubles as a deli and market, though I I would have spent far more had I ventured over to the market side.  There is indoor seating and a great many outdoor tables under a covering. I can imagine around lunchtime this place has a line out the door every day of the week. Food truly brings out culture and when hard work, time, and energy are spent on cooking you can truly taste the difference. Neomonde is authentic and delicious. Bring your taste buds here for the test should you choose not to believe me.  I would love to see a Neomonde brought to Charlotte!"}, {"review_id": "Sq6VwfFp1d-qRYUERml6QA", "user_id": "bqUNxoqH7BhlRBd_7TuGew", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "Ive been wanting to try this place for years after reading good reviews.  Unfortunately my visit wasn't memorable and i will not return.

You place your order, pay, then take your food to a crowded dining area.  While the pita and hummus were really good, the chicken salad was horribly dry. Every table was in dire need of a good cleaning.  For everything good I found, there was an equally poor experience to off set it.

Everything I've had here is so rich with spices and herbs. Great place for both meat lovers and vegetarians. So far I haven't tried anything I don't like. You can come for just the sides, or order sandwiches and kabobs as your main entree. The side items are split into 2 sections - salads/light veggie sides and savory sides. Salads are mixes of kale, quinoa, beet, lentils, etc. The savory sides include veggie lasagna, rice, lentils, and more. It seems like they change up their sides often.Lastly.. BAKLAVA. You gotta have it! They are perfectly flaky and glazed with honey. My favorite thus far is the orange and white. Mmm.I will say, however, the prices are somewhat high and sometimes the wait can be long. But I guess I can't really blame them since the ingredients are so fresh and there's such a large variety.

I ate here basically the whole time during 3 different visits to Raleigh. I especially appreciated how fresh the salads were. Look at how green my plate is in the photo! You could tell that the food hadn't been sitting out long at all. I've been eating at Mediterranean deli's for years, but what makes this place different and special is the number of salads & delicacies in their case to choose from. My favorite items include the quinoa tabouli (gluten free) & jalapeño cilantro hummus.I also visited Med deli in chapel hill and found their tabouli to be already wilted and old. So I give this place my higher approval than Med deli (even though that place is larger and sells fatayers gone wild). If you are food obsessed, be sure to check out both places.Finally, I love how when you are waiting in line, they have free bread and zataar. I ended up buying a bag of zataar each day that I went."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/neomonde-mediterranean-raleigh-raleigh?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
