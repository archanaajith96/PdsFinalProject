The bartenders have definitely come up with some unique flavour profiles and mixes. I'll explain more about the drinks in the value section. The ambiance is what you should come here for. They have live jazz in the back and it's not overpowering. You can still have a conversation with your table and enjoy the place. It's very dark and has prohibition style decor. Personally I like speakeasies and while this doesn't qualify as one for me, it does have hat atmosphere inside. So I like to call myself a financially responsible alcoholic (read: lightweight) and wouldn't say these drinks are too strong. To put in perspective, a few shots of Jameson and I'm good for hours. I had a French 75 and I think I'd need more than a few of these to keep me going. Don't get me wrong, it is delicious and probably light on purpose. Also drinks are all $18/each so not exactly cost effective.  You would definitely come here after dinner and a bottle of wine to just relax and enjoy the ambiance."}, {"review_id": "Rr9F3g8SW93wRpYd8zVG0A", "user_id": "bjZxJZQkeYLx_yYJYfDT7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "How doesn't like live music right?

I surprised my boyfriend by taking him here a few weeks ago for his birthday. Once we found it, as it doesn't look like much from the outside we were stunned with the interior. The lush yet cozy surroundings transport you to a different era. The jazz trio made the experience even more intimate and enjoyable. Our bartender Kyle was wonderful and fun and made great drink recommendations that did not disappoint. We snacked on bread and cheese set out for happy hour and enjoyed our first drinks ($10 during HH). I mentioned that I did not like Bourbon and Kyle our bartender bet that he could make me a bourbon drink I would love. Well I am always up for a little gamble... challenge accepted. And wow he sure was right it was wonderful.Kyle even took the time to give us a small tour of their secret party room and patio. The entire staff was wonderful, friendly and could make a mean cocktail. I will be back for sure and with an extensive menu there are plenty more drinks to try!"}, {"review_id": "ldYLHyXJHQYUx9AFx9veJQ", "user_id": "bO7SaBKym00SMhzlqky5xA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "I'm torn on this place.  Yes, great quality with the drinks.  No question.  Nice retro/art deco space.  But, $18 a drink is still too much for CLE.  Most people aren't able to take advantage of the happy hour pricing for whatever reasons as well.  The drink menus are little overkill/cumbersome as well.  It's like holding a damn encyclopedia volume.  Any good classic cocktail bar ANYWHERE is using house made bitters, tonics, fresh juices, etc.  So that jig is up as an excuse for the steep price.  I can go to Dear Irving in NYC, Featherweight in Brooklyn, Violet Hour in CHI, The Gibson in DC, Manifesto in KC, etc., and drink cheaper.  That shouldn't be the case with a CLE based spot."}, {"review_id": "BY30PoFFgmFLdw4hWAGwvA", "user_id": "a6N0mmRGItJJMKtVew_OMQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "I've only been in the back room which was completely full at the time.

It's a rare and classy place you go for a special day. I've come here for a birthday and I was here more recently for Valentine's Day and my experience gets better every time. I'll start off by saying it is most certainly the #1 spot in Cleveland for your exotic cocktails. I've had a few here and there's not one that I would say gets below 5 stars. My go-to cocktail tends to be the Pisco Sour. With white grape from Venezuela, cinnamon, and egg yolk- I could drink and never get tired of it. I had the same waiter almost a year apart since I've been (they're obviously doing something right) and he was just as we remembered, kind and helpful to our drink preference. In general, I adore this place for its cute hidden spot and it's inability to even look like a bar but instead just an average house on a street- if you don't look hard enough, you just might miss it! Instead towards the back you'll find yourself in a dim and relaxed atmosphere. Couches if your feeling it or 2 seat tables if you want a more focused attention atmosphere. This place woos me enough without their extraordinary live jazz band that just adds to it! Whether it's just happy hour or for a special event, this is your place. I promise you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "u7EOnF7SPvbvO_T0EGhoJg", "user_id": "imkqKNcvOlu9skaFnPo0Bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "A unique speakeasy that is a callback to a different era.

Drinks for those who prefer sweet too. Bartenders were AWESOME helping you pick what drink to get based on your tastes.Come here for drinks - food menu wasn't that large and with the location find somewhere else in o city/Tremont to eat!"}, {"review_id": "eXVKXjZFPGhC5vGzAZlOUw", "user_id": "NtpbPv31AKh1agnTJD25UA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/22/2017", "text": "If I could give them a -5 stars I would doMonday night, 11 walked in and the  1st thing the bartender said \"you are too many, you should call me before\" So, after this comments, we decided to leave to and other place.To surprise of all of us, at the time to leave the establishment the GM came after us and gave is hard time why we were leaving so soon.

Come prepared to want more, spend $$ and be mesmerized by the art of making these concoctions!!!! We sat at the bar and I really enjoyed watching the bartenders make all of the ridiculously intricate and tasty libations. By the time a table was ready for us, we opted to stay at the bar--it is seriously so cool. There are SO many options with unique combinations, it takes 20 minutes just to pick 1 drink! My husband and I had the absolute best date night here ( & costly! but worth it.) ANY drink you choose, you can send back if you don't like it. They treat you like royalty and I wish I had enough money to go back every weekend. I don't think any of the drinks would disappoint, but the menu is broken down by what type of liquor it is made with. And hey, if you don't like it- you can always send it back and try a new one! No parking lot and go early!!! We went around 6...any later and we would have had to wait a while to find a seat.

It was a very busy night when we arrived and waited for a long time at our table for our waitress. Given this was a very busy night, we understood and the waitress apologized. However, the frustrating part was that by the end of the night, when the crowd has died down and there were 4 staff vs 4 customers at the bar and or table in the front room, it took about 30 min between getting the check and someone picked up our credit cards. We made eye contact with various staff multiple times and they took no action to come over. The drink itself was yummy, I had the Shanghai Fizz. But honestly with a wait like that end the end of the night, I forgot and no longer cared about the drink. Left with a lot of frustration.Update: The owner contacted me and addressed the issue very appropriately. Very impressed!"}, {"review_id": "mwWUOM4cCyvo4VzpwqSmKA", "user_id": "tQz_0FZrxlulgz5X_prthg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/24/2017", "text": "Love this place. The drinks are simply the best.

Consistency and care in these cocktail concoctions is the key (wow, how was that for the most alliteration in one sentence?) Tucked away in a residential area in Ohio City/Tremont/Duck Island (I have no idea what that area is called, use your GPS, I am useless) VTR is inside a little house with nothing more than a single discreet neon sign. Don't blink or you might miss it. No need to dress up, but you might want to with the speakeasy vibe. The no hats rule IS enforced. But let's get to what matters, the cocktails. VTR gives you a huge book of cocktail choices. They are separated by flavor profile and ranked by strength. It can be overwhelming so trust your bartender to pick suggest one if you can't decide. These drinks are made one by one, no pre-made mixers. Any flavorings are either fresh herbs, juices, fruits or house - made syrups. They take a little time and the prices are higher, but it's worth it. This isn't a place you go to get drunk (go to a dive bar for that), but that being said the drinks ARE on the stronger side. No skimping on the spirits here. It's a great place to celebrate an occasion  (\"Hey its Tuesday!\") or take a date. Try it during happy hour (4-7 weekdays) to save a little on your wallet. The jazz band adds to the ambiance. This is a Cleveland institution that you MUST try at least once. But I have a feeling you will want to go back."}, {"review_id": "FTMkKInxmgQ5YOssWk_Q3A", "user_id": "cmegLi9CypRXpND7-05B_Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "6/3/2017", "text": "Drinks are good but nowhere near worthy of the price and at $18 gratuity shld already be included.
