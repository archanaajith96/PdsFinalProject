The Thai Diner didn't disappoint! I came in the door at 4 and by 4:05 I had food in front of me - wonderful! I ordered the Massaman Curry with a Thai tea and it was delicious! Great portion size with plenty of soup to pour over the rice! Really well flavored - I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "zkSlD7P5VFHD4gq1jKKiYw", "user_id": "p2IvgM0wdd6FS6ji6868RQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Each time I have been to this restaurant I have been so pleased with the great food, the kind staff, and the cleanliness of the facility. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Thai food.Be sure and get the crab and angels with the sweet sauce!Another tip: get the Sweet & Sour (Tom Yum) and get it Thai Spicy. It's perfect. I've tried every Thai restaurant in the region...this is the best!"}, {"review_id": "4QoeH8oHbkuutiqPMAZk6A", "user_id": "25k27oWSff0mbw2a-MuAFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Perfect food.

The masaman curry was spicy but mild with the coconut milk cooling down your mouth. I will be back to try other curry items on the menu. The dining room is not large and fills up quickly but if you have to wait a few minutes it will be worth your time. Their service as quick and made for a very pleasant experience."}, {"review_id": "2hlh5C2U-rjid1Rct5s74Q", "user_id": "jpVXLuPcRgEAiFeZjhSBsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Best Thai food in Mobile!

Menu is very big but I normally stick to my Tom yum soup, beef salad and pad Thai. The Tom yum was good but it wasn't strong in flavor. It tasted like a healthier Tom yum soup that I am used to. The beef salad was good. Traditionally it taste more like fish sauce and lime. The salad was very smokey but good. Pad Thai was good too but on the sweet side so I would recommend Thai hot to balance the sweetness of the dish. Overall this restaurant was good but I prefer teak house"}, {"review_id": "HT9lKd4P1ImdJi1J7xXv_Q", "user_id": "wxiVUvbwhsU15pfLOy8kbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2017", "text": "Amazing!
