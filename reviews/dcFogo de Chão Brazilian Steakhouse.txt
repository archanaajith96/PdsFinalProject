However, this was probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had. At least when it comes to the food. So, we had reservations at 7:00 for 4 for a birthday. Unfortunately, they would not seat us until the whole party arrived. When we all did arrive, we still had to wait another 15 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated, the server came over right away and greeted us and brought us water. They explained we have unlimited access to the buffet they had with cheese and salad. I was very disappointed with the buffet. We have a similar steak house in Tampa, Florida and they have sooooooo much more to chose from. You can chose from sushi to salad to cheese to fruit to other things. Whereas here, it was a sad view of a salad buffet and some random vegetables and some cheese and that was it. I was very disappointed.Then when it came to the meat, it was impossible it seemed to get the meal brought out well done. I am pregnant, so I have no choice but to eat meat well done. At one point, my husband got a little upset and explained that we were there to eat, and they needed to bring out the meat well cooked. Anyway, they finally brought me some \"well done\" meat and it was more burnt than well done. At this point, I had it and completely lost my appetite. The only thing that I enjoyed was our server and the mashed potatoes."}, {"review_id": "IcJWJEqUctd3Y4xMOsZKEA", "user_id": "2HcTWvopwFNsOSmHVwyFjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Excellent place for everything steak and Brazilian food.

Writing this review is making my mouth water. This experience can be a bit overwhelming because of all the meat selections brought to your table. The must try: Ribeye,  Prime Sirloin, lamb chops and the filet mignon. The meats are absolutely amazing and you have options of meat at different temperatures which is a plus, I prefer medium and my friend preferred med rare. The salad bar is pretty solid, you are so preoccupied with the meats you forget about it! I suggest grabbing a few things before you start enjoying your meat selection. The Brazilian lemonade is a real treat and super refreshing. Made with lime and condensed milk (this drink is refillable) Tip: come during lunch hour. Not as many people and less expensive than the dinner rate."}, {"review_id": "lA3kGxnhU-YYKOcqRsROdg", "user_id": "avpQYs39Ubhp359EdSdRMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Love the meat! Chicken, lamb, pork, steak - they have it all! They have beef tenderloin, top sirloin, rib eye, pork sausage, and more. The concept is simple. Everyone gets a coaster that is green on one side and red on the other. When the green side is facing up, waiters will continue bringing the meat. When it's red, no meat. Even though you're paying at  least $60 per person here, you're getting the real deal. And you will leave stuffed. I'm not too big on pork, but the pork was outstanding, maybe my favorite. They also brought mashed potatoes and plantains to the table which were terrific. When we first sat down, they brought over fresh cheese bread. I don't think there was anything here I didn't like.The Market Table/Salad Bar is quite possible the best salad bar I have been to. Huge, fresh mozzarella balls! The most underrated item at Fogo. Everyone talks about the meat, but the fresh mozzarella is delicious! The market table also has smoked salmon, Hearts of Palm, edamame, beets, asparagus, marinated mushrooms, zucchini, and so much more. It is top notch. So even if you are not a meat eater, you will have plenty of outstanding items to choose from at the market table. This is a high-end, classy place, so dress accordingly. Although it is very spacious, it does get very crowded on a Friday and Saturday night. Consider making reservations, especially for a large group. Great experience, and will definitely return."}, {"review_id": "v4V0mPPDpV6plAf3bgyZnw", "user_id": "xj7JLqQ_i6giz7uQ8gDcfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Wow.

You have your selection of so many kinds of meat that are all well-seasoned. The salad bar is ok but I do wish they had more hot food options. Aside from the cheesy bread balls, I thought the other side dishes they brought out were just ok. The service is pretty solid and I appreciated the fact that they ask you what specific meats you want rather than just offering the same cycle/rotation of meats. I think the price point is fair considering you would be paying close to $100 (sans alcohol) at one of the high-end steakhouses and here, you'd pay about $70.
