We arrive around 3-4pm on a Sunday. I was really sad there weren't many pastries to choose from which is the reason for my visit. However I did grab the last chocolate chip scone and my goodness I am so thankful it was there waiting for me. It was DELICIOUS!! Definitely one of the top tasty scones I've ever had! (Big scone fan!) The environment was very open and you can literally see everything. Which is always a good thing in my opinion because you know things are clean and done right. My husband wanted a pick me up coffee and although they were out, the gentleman was kind enough to brew a fresh batch for him. Definitely will be back to get my hands on more pastry options and a pizza!"}, {"review_id": "AvgpP3z9pI0cUxDUoU1AtQ", "user_id": "YBdZq9toJPnTkhqmN7Lu2w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "What a hidden gem!!

I had the all white pizza, which is not what they ended up giving me, and my husband carnivore pizza and a ham and gruyere cheese croissant. My white pizza came with basil and no garlic or olive oil. They also didnt use the ricotta spread. It wasn't a white pizza, which is what I had been craving but it wasn't bad for what they gave us. I will have to go back at some point and actually try the white pizza. The croissant was light and flakey with a buttery flavour. The croissant on its own would have been nice. The ham and gruyere enhanced the richness of the croissant.The meat pizza was a good traditional meat pizza. It had sausage, pepperoni and ham. There was a good balance of meat, cheese and sauce. If we had eaten there, I'm pretty sure the meat pizza would have been even better!"}, {"review_id": "NT0jgvZKSaMNgMiMTBQCKw", "user_id": "FUgNshC9iw1roEB4A_GNEQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "Pretty tasty - but not a favorite to add to my list of best pizza in VA!I so love wood fire pizza!  As a result, I was super excited to try this place.  It smells divine once you pull on the front door to walk inside.  We were immediately greeted as we witnessed a party of three dinning in and a couple walked in directly after my daughter and I.So I thought...hmmm pretty steady on a week night.  And I love to see other patrons come in as well it kinda eases my concerns if a place is really good or just on certain occasions.  So while at ease, my daughter and I kept it simple, a small pizza with half pepperoni.We were hungry so we dived in immediately after arriving home...15 minutes from the restaurant.The pizza was yummy and super light.  I mean how can you go wrong with pizza feeling super light but filling.  We were please and satisfied with two slices each.  The pizza is a bit pricey but please believe you are paying for quality ingredients here.Parking is limited - I believe there is only street parking available. Go at your own risk, but they feature a lot of other baked goods not just pizza.  There are several pizza toppings to choose from and specialized pizza too.

Spark notes version: I still don't believe this place has the best pizza in the area, but it is good. We had the Salami Arugula Pizza and I appreciated the light and airy but still moist (and not crunchy) crust.  The toppings were fresh, especially the arugula, I typically wouldn't order a pizza with this for fear of it being wilted (and not just due to heat). To me what was lacking was the sauce, not just in the amount of it, but the actual flavor. Nothing stood out, I'm sure it was seasoned, it just didn't taste like it. This is definitely one of the better pizza shops in the area, and I will definitely return if I'm in this part of town, but it wasn't the over the top pizza that I was expecting.

Just kidding, this area is being reborn. A great bakery with great pizza is a way to do just that.1) The pizza is thick crusted and the ingredients are fresh. This comes one to what I ate in Italy when I was little. Which one between the pepperoni and the Napoli was better? Don't make me choose! That's like asking a parent to choose the favorite child. 2) The bake items are to die for too. The foccia was perfect. I took a large chunk of this home and I will be honest I don't think I shared it with anyone. It was very close to what I would have eaten when I was little living in Italy The croissants stuffed with chocolate were a major hit with the people I brought them back for. If you have a sweet tooth these are definitely something that you should eat. 3) I am never up early enough, but they also have breakfast sandwiches which the brewers over at Benchtop told me are to die for."}, {"review_id": "WpPnt8iKYHwhnV41KGOpnw", "user_id": "_mPrUh0PhG8BpGs-RQkaWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/7/2017", "text": "My fiancé and I tried this spot for the very first time today.

You can absolutely tell that they use fresh ingredients. It's a weird thing to say, but I actually felt like I was eating healthy lol They also have a couple picnic tables outside, which is nice because we decided to bring our pups!

First, the \"dining area\" is just 3 tables and is a clear statement that they are not encouraging anyone to dine in. I think the chairs are there for customers and Order Up drivers to sit and wait for pizzas. Honestly, one of the reasons we won't be back is because there just isn't anything particularly remarkable about anything I've had there. And also, the staff don't seem to have any interest at all in making any sort of connection or customer service impression on patrons. Thirdly, they are VERY overpriced for the service and product they are offering. Even if I was just at The Birch next door and wanted food-I wouldn't order a pizza, I would just order from the menu at The Birch which is wonderful and the staff are friendly. I did enjoy the cookies at Bakehouse. Bread loaves didn't look appealing and the prices are too high. During our last visit, an older man came in with some teenagers, we had been sitting WAITING FOREVER for our pizza and we were starving. It had been almost an hour. We watched several customers walk in, get their to-go pizzas and leave. I understand they ordered over the phone but it was frustrating. This older man walked in, it appeared that he either owned the place or managed the place since the employees were seeming to suck up the entire time. He walked over and got drinks, pizzas, cookies and gave them to the teens who sat there and happily ate while we continued to wait. The pizza is very basic. Not incredibly flavorful. It's just nothing to make me go back. Especially since there is zero greeting of any kind, zero affable customer service, just nothing to bring me back. It had an uppity vibe, is obviously a take-out driven place, and I tried to like it several times. I could grab a Digiorno and not really feel like I was missing anything."}, {"review_id": "woQM2nVXfCNCjbqLIyxWLg", "user_id": "nR3uwAXil9rl44akHSBdxw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "My family has stopped by late afternoon in the past for a few baked treats and found them to be scrumptious.  Today I had one of their made to order breakfast sandwiches and it was fantastic!  I had egg, bacon, arugula, and fontina cheese on a croissant.  It was to die for.  The only downside of this place is that it is not a nice atmosphere to stay and eat.  The color on the walls is dreary, even on a sunny day, and the seating isn't comfortable.  If you are grabbing food to go, they are top notch, though.  I can't wait to try one of their pizzas next time!"}, {"review_id": "gXCLF9klzAjFryAtPpLWqA", "user_id": "R6PI0-sSYhmR2HZwMm5Y9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Can I say over yummyyyyy the pizza is delicious and their breakfast sandwiches are perfect.

(I prefer white sauce, so she she recommended the white pizza that has roasted garlic ricotta spread, sprinkled with mozzarella, and topped with fresh organic spinach, extra olive oil and cracked peppers... but we needed some meat so we added pepperoni to our pizza.)

My pizza, the medium pepperoni, was the only one of the 4 purchased that was over-charred.  While the other pizza's were sparingly charred, as they should be considering they are using a high-temp wood fired oven, the crust on my pizza was predominately charred. The entire bottom was black while 75% of the upper crust was, too.  Every bite I took had that 'burnt' taste, and if you've eaten a grilled cheese that was over-cooked, you know what that tastes like.  Not good. Not enjoyable. Not fun.The sauce, well, is kind of hard to review, because it was hidden well beneath layers of cheese and grease, presumably from the pepperoni. Cheese was standard.  Nothing anyone hasn't experienced before.The other diners at the table, despite them eating a normal, not over-charred pizza, thought the pizza was just \"Meh, I've had better.\"  Which is far from a compliment, because the pizza in Hampton Roads as a whole, is disappointing, to say the least. Mine, well, it was terrible.On to some other things....The price.  I don't have a problem paying money for good food.  But I do have a problem paying $70 for 3 medium pizzas, 1 small pizza and 4 root beers.  That, to me, is quite excessive for mediocre / terrible pizza and soda.I'd suggest skipping this place. If you want a pizza, or any food for that matter, that is cooked in a wood fired oven, there are other places in Hampton Roads that do it better, for cheaper."}, {"review_id": "Ue-zgKMK1L-AwVCBxebcKQ", "user_id": "IIiDBRUG0rHz5tPSTPHQwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/26/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Finally got a chance to try out their Oven stove Pizza and it was delicious!

Flaky, soft, and what the perfect croissant should be. The chocolate croissant and croinoli (croissant/cannoli) did not shy away from the fillings, which I love. The chocolate croissant is their bread and butter: decadent, yet not too overdone. I thought dark chocolate was a nice touch. The croinoli was a Thursday special, so I had to try it! If you are going more for the dessert, this would be the perfect pick-me-up. I was afraid the filling would make the croissant soggy, but it still retained the perfect flakiness. I would definitely be back for the croinoli. It was that good.The morning bun is essentially a flaky cinnamon roll with a sugar coat. The bread was a little more chewy than the croissant but still had the nice flakiness. The sugar coat tasted like creme brûlée! It went so well with my coffee (from eastern shore coastal roasters), which I recommend. My friends also got the peacan coffee cake and white chocolate chip scones, which were all delicious. The special pastries: Thursdays (croinoli), Fri-Sun (almond croissant). They will have seasonal flavors like apple turnovers and pumpkin scones coming out soon! The ambience feels like artisan bake shop with a lot of local flavor. Friendly staff who explain their menu. Be warned: there is limited seating (4 medium sized tables inside and 2 outdoor round tables).

Sometimes just a little around the edges and on top, but other times they are inedible. Once, another customer and myself were given pizzas within five minutes of each other and both of us asked to have them re-made because they were overbaked. The baker explained that the oven was just heated and that can make it overly hot. My question is this; when you see that the pizza you're handing to the customer is burnt, why not just make a new one immediately?This issue isn't limited to just pizzas, either. Pastries are often burnt or dry due to overbaking. I've had to peel the top layers off of rolls and buns in order to eat them.When they get it right, their goods are heavenly. I can forgive so much, like out of the way locations, street parking, and uncomfortable seating, for a fantastic croissant; but premium priced items should be perfect and if you can't eat all of your pizza, bun, roll, etc, then you're not getting what you pay for."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bakehouse-at-chelsea-norfolk?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
