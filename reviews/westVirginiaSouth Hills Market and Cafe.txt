We were seated right by the door which made for a very cold dining experience. We got there around 4:45 and were told we had to order from the lunch menu. Then it took so long for our order to be taken that we had to order from the dinner menu. Our waiter also had no idea about our questions on menu items and they also seemed to be out of a lot of items. There was a decent beer selection listed but mostly bottles and cans. The tap options weren't listed anywhere we could see and when we asked the waiter wasn't sure what was on tap, so we went with what was listed. One of our beers cost over $8. I understand craft beer is pricier, however a Bottle of Southern Tier should not be $8. I ordered chicken and waffles and my husband ordered a burger. My meal was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. The waffle was small and the syrup it came with wasn't ideal and they were out of collard greens. They substituted spinach for the greens and the way it was plated left the waffle on top of the spinach making it very soggy. The chicken was cooked almost perfectly. For an establishment with these prices and \"upscale\" feel, you'd think they would give you a choice on how a burger is cooked. They did not. My husband's burger was WELL done. He also ordered fries, which came with nothing to dip in although the menu stated it included two sauces. Our waiter was basically nonexistent once our meals were dropped off. He came back about 35 minutes after and said his other tables kept asking for things so he had forgotten about us. Lackluster food, slow/inattentive service, and very overpriced for what was served. Not from that area, but probably wouldn't go back if we were."}, {"review_id": "gc1vi0HtZjJ3Mxk7MA5dtA", "user_id": "2ouct-SPac1CrWPzGTBYXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "It's become our tradition to stop here after hikes at nearby Kanawha State Forest.

It's a Wine Spectator Award Winner, so in my book that's a big plus. I am intrigued by all of the menu options, but was confused at the same time. I was last in my party to get here, so I was not sure what the multiple choices on the menu were. It was baffling! That said, I LOVE options, and the assemble-by-me chicken soft tacos were fun and very tasty!

Thanks to Yelp, we chose South Hills Market and Cafe as our destination.On a Thursday around 4pm, the place was vacant but for one other pair of customers.The first thing I noticed was that the women's restroom was clean. Hallelujah!  The next thing I noticed was the restaurant's calming atmosphere: subdued paint, nice music.We were presented with a lunch menu, which was fine.  Paul and I split the egg rolls, which I thought were just okay.  If you are not a fan of collard greens, I suggest choosing something else.  Paul ordered the chicken salad with cheddar chips, and I opted for the Kobe burger with Swiss and cheddar and a side of pickled beets.  Paul enjoyed his food. I LOVED mine.  The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and served on a toasted brioche bun.  It was the best burger I have had in quite awhile. And the pickled beets were amazing.A few minor complaints: although the wooden seats are cushioned, the cushions do little to protect one's rear end and back. Service was incredibly friendly but too slow.  Paul was unable to have a caramelmacchiato because they were out of caramel.All and all a very good experience. I would definitely return for that burger and those beets. Wow!"}, {"review_id": "qB1apENkLFRA5mBq6bNulg", "user_id": "bsfLB4YbnUJ5zOMVB-yA4Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2017", "text": "I was visiting Charleston a few days ago, and needed something quick and good for lunch. The locals highly recommended trying South Hills Market and Cafe. When I first entered the restaurant, I liked the feel of the place. The decor was very DIY chic. I loved the hand painted straw and top hats on the restroom doors and the wooden tables. There was a nice bar along the side of the wall which offered a large collection of wine.The cafe offered a simple lunch menu of snacks, appetizers, salads, sandwiches/wraps and burgers. With the sandwiches/wraps you had the option of ordering a half for $7 or a full sandwich/wrap for $10. I ordered a half of The Greek Wrap, which was made with romaine, roasted chicken, feta, kalamatas, red onions, tomatoes and herb vinaigrette with a side of artichokes. The wrap was light, fresh and delicious! The artichokes were excellent and had a unique flavor. The portion was just the right amount for me, but I thought the overall meal was overpriced for the quantity of food. My plate looked empty and the artichokes were served in a ketchup dispenser. This diminished the quality of the meal.I was also very disappointed by the poor customer service. I think my server woke up on the wrong side of the bed, because she was very rude. She never introduced herself, asked me how my food was, or if I needed anything. My server may have had a bad day, but she could use a course in proper dining etiquette. Overall, I would give South Hills Market and Cafe 3 stars. I thought the cafe was a decent lunch place. The lunch menu was simple and offered great food items. The reason why the cafe is only receiving 3 stars is because the presentation of the food, portion sizes and customer service could use improvement."}, {"review_id": "xHGbVUHa4uVQWmBg-ofdyQ", "user_id": "zJkoaK81LTYXsON6fXFg2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "Amazing food!!

I didn't leave a review at the time, because I had originally intended to give it another shot. However, after reading a nasty comment the owner left on another poor review, I decided against that...so here goes.When I was in, it was with a party of 3 other people. I had the bone marrow, which was mediocre (especially for a $14 appetizer). Another party member ordered the oysters, which were incredibly bland and tasted mostly of unseasoned cornmeal. I ordered the grouper as my entree, which was surprisingly good.I did not dislike the food to the extent that I wouldn't have come back to give them another shot, even though there was a bit lacking given that they obviously market and price themselves as a higher end restaurant. Service left a bit to be desired and they were not busy at the time.However, when I read Paul S's review and then read the owner's comment to that review, I was a bit floored. Not only does she seem to be insulted that someone could dare dislike her restaurant, but she actually went on to personally insult him by \"suggesting he use spell check\" and then passive aggressively threaten him by suggesting he \"come to our restaurant in person and speak with my husband, the Chef\".Completely unacceptable behavior from a restaurant owner. I won't be back and I encourage anyone else who reads this review to avoid at all costs."}, {"review_id": "zv7S0ByYHsBweJtWST4IEA", "user_id": "XKRV7ST28q1ZnMaxNVf5pA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2017", "text": "Plain on the outside, unique and classy on the inside.

They had a small window as we were early, and juggled some incoming reservations around to have ample time to serve the 5 of us.  Onto the food, it was exceptional.  Only my third visit, but perfect every time. My niece got the chicken and waffles, and was more than pleased. Two pieces of plump and succulent chicken and pecan waffles, honey butter and maple syrup. I had the Kobe burger with caramelized onions, fried egg and bernaise sauce on brioche.  Best tasting burger in Charleston, hands down. I started with the French Onion soup, brioche crouton and loaded with onions, brandy and gruyere cheese.  Very tasty as well.  My sister got the cast iron tacos with chicken, grouper and steak, pico, Guacamole and creme fraiche. That was ample food to feed her and my smaller niece, and they were both pleased. I tried their grouper and it was delicious.  My daughter had a grilled cheese, as she's not very adventurous, but it was spot on with a side of fries and she was a happy camper. We had a slightly longer wait than we thought, but nothing out of the ordinary for the quality and presentation of food.  We were in and out in under 75 minutes.  This is easily one of Charleston's top 10 dining experiences in a casual,  non-pretentious but lovely setting."}, {"review_id": "xtHpbucEBRY6BWQx8C4H2g", "user_id": "yYf1G35KgYeaXizFh_p8ig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/13/2017", "text": "Amazing food, incredible service. The servers always accommodate special requests and make guests feel right at home; they'll graciously go so far as to adjust a very gourmet menu to create something a picky kid will eat. Everything from the steaks, burgers, and fish, to the sides (mac and cheese!) and salads (the Caesar salad is a must have) always satisfies. The Market is perfect for a laid back lunch or a special dinner - it's my family's favorite for birthday dinners. Restaurant week is always killer.

It has a full bar and dining room, The food options were outstanding as was the service. My wife said if they gave academic degrees for wait staff our waitress, Madeline, would have a PhD. She knew in detail about every entree', how it was prepared, etc. Once served the food was prepared to perfection and was delicious. In fact, the bartender was also most friendly and helpful as well. I had a beef entree' that came with asparagus and an unbelievable onion ring wrapped in prosciutto with pealed potato on the base and a perfectly cooked \"poached\" egg on top. The beef was cooked exactly as ordered, medium, and was as tender as any beef I've ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant even though it is off of the beaten path.

The tables are close together, and this leads to waitstaff having to awkwardly sift through the room to deliver food and beverages to their tables. My family ate here during restaurant week as we wanted to try something new, and our food was overall good. I had a lemon cocktail that was wonderful. Our waiter was a bit stiff, and some guidance as to how the \"flow\" was to go would have been helpful. My dad's appetizer/first course was served a decent amount of time after the rest of the party (which is odd because it was the least likely to require on-demand cooking as it was a served-cold dip). This was a little odd considering the caliber of restaurant this venue is trying to be. Overall, there are other restaurants in Charleston where I feel I could get more value for my money. Maybe it was pains of restaurant week, but I'm not sure that I can say I would dine here again."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/south-hills-market-and-cafe-charleston-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
