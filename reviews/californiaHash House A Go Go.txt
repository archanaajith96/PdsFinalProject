The brown-sugar, banana pancake was AMAZING. The syrup is to die for.  (If you order, one full meal, you can order a kid pancake (three of us shared a hash-up and the kid's pancake and still took a to go box home!)Crazy busy on the weekends but there is a great bar next door (The Loft) to get a drink and play a game of pool while you wait).

Then you will likely be placed at the bar with the other solo diners. If you have been trying to get an in, take that approach. The table turnover rate is much higher than waiting for a full table. Then, you and your plus-1 can meet later to discuss how amazing the meal, service and experience were. I heard about Hash House many years ago during a conversation about the best breakfast experiences had in the U.S. One of my colleagues raved about this place and, since then, it has been on my must-experience list. Enter March 2018. After years -- YEARS -- waiting to check this place out, I had the wonderful benefit of walking right in and taking a seat. No wait at all. Seated at the bar, I got personalized attention from a lead and two servers. How awesome is that. The lead (did not get her name, ugh) was uber helpful and, even though the place was terribly busy, she took time to explain the menu and some of the concepts. How awesome is that?!With her encouragement, I went with the HH Original.When the server slid the plate in front of me, I said: \"Um...I didn't realize I was ordering breakfast for four.\"Her response: \"We won't judge you, and we have to go containers.\" Ha! The HH eggs Benedict is served with a roasted pepper sauce, spinach, tomatoes, a split biscuit (which is utterly massive), large slices of bacon and cheesy potatoes because WHY NOT! The bacon was thick and full of flavor. The eggs were poached nicely and were sizable. Be sure to ask for light sauce if you have that preference, because the chef does not hold back on spooning the goodness.*clenches heart*And because it is a terrible sin to eat here and not try the sage chicken, I got a single cut on the side. The essence of sage is strong, but not overwhelming, and you get it in every single crunchy bite. *throws head back*Decadent!The concept is this: The co-founders were driven to introduce a restaurant where diners could have a fun, enjoyable time while enjoying farm fresh-sourced agriculture and live stock. They wanted to go old school, but with a contemporary flair. The interior space is tiny, but there is a patio out back. NOTE: You are forewarned if you have spatial issues. It is tight here.As for the rest of the menu, I was surprised at how selective it is. You do have a good number of offerings -- with hashes, Benedicts, pancakes, waffles and basic breakfast offerings. But they are not handing you a dictionary of eats like some of my favorite mom and pop shops. And I will say that even though you may know exactly what you want to order, please peruse the menu. You'll see interesting and cheeky offerings like: the O'Hare of the dog: Signature 24 oz Budweiser in a bag & side of bacon. The team also steps up the ingredients with house smoked salmon, basil pesto, brie, mozzarella, goat cheese, chipotle charred tomato, asparagus, etc. So fancy. The team has specialized its great eats, and is driving those. Brilliantly done."}, {"review_id": "LY96BzuixXMHOoS6Bhlqbg", "user_id": "cJ7v1pTqLVDp3uC-YGE4Ug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "No wonder why this place is so popular and always have a long wait.

The crispy potatoes are so addicting. No herb, not even pepper, just salt but they deep fried to absolute perfection. We went at 8am and didn't have to wait, and would recommend going early for sure.

After flying in from San Jose, my boyfriend and I decided to get breakfast at Hash House. I never had the chance to try this place when I lived in SD until now. Anyway, we totally wanted to try what was the best selling item which was the chicken and waffles. Oh my gosh. It was a lot. We definitely had to share. The chicken was very good. The waffles had a surprise in it! BACON!!! We were really surprised about it! I've never had that before so it was something new to my palette. I would come back here and try the hash plates. I'd probably try the corned beef hash next time.Definitely one of the places to go to when in San Diego."}, {"review_id": "u1LDE4OX3cdgG0Oa4PG0mQ", "user_id": "Fb-_RijOvxz4X0X6nwTelg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Order Andy's Famous Sage Fried chicken and vanilla waffle.  Portion size is 'America!  I'm a fattie and the potions was enough to feed 2 hangry adults and 8 yr old.

As I wanted to see what all the hype was all about. Don't come starving. As you can wait up to an hour on the weekends. I had some friends who live in the area. So I decided to join them for breakfast.Hash House A Go Go will not seat you until all the people in your party are together. My friends I arrived about 45 minutes before I did. I was lucky to only wait about 10 minutes before we go seated. After being seated your drink order is taken. As I'm not a big breakfast person. After looking at the menu I decided to have the banana pancakes. The food portions are very generous that big enough to share with two people. It all depends how much you can eat. After one bite into the pancakes I was sold. For a person who eats out 7 days a week. You get tired of what to eat. I'm a fan of  Hash House A Go Go. If you are a person who loves great food then I recommend coming to Hash House A Go Go.The customer service was excellent from the minute you where seated to the minute you got up. If you are a person who has patience for waiting then it's 100% worth the wait.For the only negative about Hillcrest is parking. As parking can be a hit or miss. Overall I enjoyed the food to come back."}, {"review_id": "cIdgN653CVrove__k3p5HQ", "user_id": "DtbGojy1wCnBOIIbyAO4Bw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Best. Bloody Marys. Ever!

Considering the amount of people waiting to be seated, we were supposed to be seated in about 20-30 mins. But I feel like we were seated in 15. It was quite a bit shorter than waiting the 45 min wait for Snooze. I got the Vanilla waffle which was very fluffy. Simplicity at its finest. Be mindful of the serving size! It was basically 4 regular sized waffles in one! My husband got the sage chicken. It was really good and he finished most of it but there was just a lot overall. The mashed potatoes were delicious! I believe my friend got a BBLT burger with fries. Everything we ordered tasted pretty great and the service was good. For 3 big meals, a regular coffee, a kid's apple juice (no refills on juice btw), and the hibiscus lemonade for about $70 was not bad. I really wanted to try the hibiscus lemonade. It was sweet and quite tart. But I loved it. I'm only giving 4 stars because as I was cutting my strawberries from my waffles (after I had finished it already) the inside of one of them was brown. I thought it was bruised but... it looked like it had mold (it had the white stuff already). That made me upset because I'm pregnant and I almost ate the strawberry. I was only cutting it because I have braces and am cautious about getting the seeds stuck in the front of my teeth. As you can see from the picture, the strawberries looked great. But one of them had mold already on the opposite side."}, {"review_id": "k5id2kwxNHWSNoOEFgaSow", "user_id": "-5lOjA-DymtPai1i8toROA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Hash House fried maple sage chicken brings all the boys to the yard.....Seriously... just go...

What made me upset wasn't just the size, it was the raw spinach and raw peppers and fried egg on top that I didn't understand.  This plate came out from the kitchen so fast we were surprised.

I suggest you come during the week to avoid the hour long waits. I've been here a couple of times only for their huge pancakes! Anyone unfamiliar with Hash House, beware if you are planning on getting a pancake for yourself. It honestly could feed 2-3 people! The taste of their food is good, but imo not over the top. The service is good as well and everything else they present (cleanliness, looks of food, and friendliness) is satisfactory.

The wait is loooooong during peak hours so I would suggest to come before 12, the wait time differences between coming at say 11, or after 12, are super different. I arrived at 11 on a Sunday and the wait was 15-30 minutes for 2, another time I came after 12 on a Saturday and the wait was  60-90 minutes for 2. However, they have a great check in system which lets you check your spot in line from an app, NoWait, so you can wander around or wait in your car if the wait is really long, and just come back when you're nearing the front of the line.Prices for items may seem expensive, but do not make the same mistake as I did, ordering one item for myself and another for my friend. Now I just order one item and share it between my boyfriend and I, and we still have leftovers to take home.SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT+ fluffy scrambled eggs with savory fried chicken is soooo bomb+ try cutting up the benedict into slices so you get a mouthful of fried chicken, spinach, tomato, and egg+ love the mashed potatoes combined with biscuit, then dipped into the sauce providedSAGE CHICKEN WAFFLE TOWER+ the waffle tower is no joke in size+ waffles have bacon weaved into them???? amazing+ syrupy fried chicken combined with waffles is so deliciousService is always prompt and friendly!
