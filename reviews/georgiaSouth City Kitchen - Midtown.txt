Boy have I been missing out! This location is about 5 mins from my house which is perfect but the quality of food + price are the things that sold the deal.The environment was cool and welcoming, which made it an enjoyable first experience. I ordered the fried chicken, mashed potatoes + greens that all the Yelpers raved about. Let's just say there were very accurate. Everything was seasoned perfectly, portion size was more than I expected and the service was just spot on. Pricing is affordable. The cool thing is that this establishment is perfect for lunch time p/ups but it's also a cool dinner spot. Sometimes it's hard to find those. I'll be returning. Job well done."}, {"review_id": "wx-7mK6u23SfcJN5Cf0Zzg", "user_id": "43ALyrXzHVLcC-Sx4FHJHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Bravo!!!Had dinner two nights ago and I cab still taste the flavors of the fried chicken.  Absolutely delicious!!This is not your Momma's fried chicken.

The chicken livers were too salty, the corvina too bland (even salt couldn't really salvage it), but the trout was just right. I would definitely get the trout again - thick filets, with skin pan fried to a nice crisp, gently atop a melange of beans.

I was in town from St. Louis and was by myself. My waitress (man I wish I remembered her name, but she had dreads, if that helps) was extremely welcoming, helpful, and friendly. All of the staff were very nice and courteous. I ordered the fried green tomatoes, a mimosa, and the chicken and waffles. EVERYTHING was delicious! The tomatoes were thee (yes, thee) BEST fried green tomatoes I have ever tasted in my life!!!!! I think everyone else's version of the dish is playing for second. Seriously, they've got you beat! They're served with fresh marinara sauce and are made with a nice cheese. The chicken and waffles took a rather long time to arrive, but also were very good.I was pleased with both dishes, and the complimentary bread basket of a biscuit and cornbread completed the meal nicely. I really enjoyed my time here and highly recommend you check this place out! And you absolutely have to get those amazing tomatoes! In a town full of fantastic southern cuisine, this place stands out with a nice, laid-back, yet trendy charm."}, {"review_id": "9-Gdmbl4TcFBxbQNNffmRA", "user_id": "ChrkZVO5M-J6T_9FnsbUzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "I've been to South City Kitchen Midtown a long time ago. I'm surprised I never reviewed it. I think the Midtown location is the OG South City Kitchen. One of the things about the Midtown location is that you have to pay for parking. And parking is expensive! On Sunday, I had to pay $10 for parking. That's a lot of money to pay just to go there to eat brunch. I would suggest going to their other locations if you don't want to pay a huge parking fee. They don't validate parking either. The inside looks like an old, Southern house. It's two stories, with seating available on both stories. In such a small real-estate, they seemed to have maximized their spaces. The bathroom is also upstairs. Their brunch menu looks standard. You can get your mimosas or Bellinis in a pitcher. You can get your standard pimento cheeses, frittatas, and other brunch-like goodies. I opted for the classic Chicken and Waffles. On their menu, it's called, \"Springer Mountain Farms Fried Chicken & Malted Buttermilk Waffle.\" What a mouthful. The dish consisted of fried white meat chicken and 4 pieces of buttermilk waffle. The presentation, as usual, looked great. South City Kitchen always does a great job on their presentation. It's so Instagram friendly. The waffles tasted great, especially with their Vermont maple syrup. The chicken was spiced well and was juicy. I got to try the Carolina Trout and that tasted great too. The trout tasted nice and fresh. The lentil salad that was under the fried trout tasted good too.They also give you their complimentary, addictive cornbread and biscuits for the table. It comes with butter and apple butter. Those were so good. You have to be careful you don't get full off the bread alone. I loved how the cornbread had pieces of corn kernels. The service was amazing. Our server took care of very well. South City Kitchen always had amazing service from my experience. They know how to take care of their clients, act friendly, and they just do a great job. I wish I remember her name to call her out, but I forgotten. :( Oh well, she did a great job. Besides parking, South City Kitchen Midtown is one of the better High-end Southern Restaurants to go to."}, {"review_id": "9hT3owb9nQQ-EtpUkBhkRg", "user_id": "XKxi1gkxmb9kqF_HXHe4aA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "My brother and I wanted some traditional Southern cooking while visiting Atlanta, so we followed the great Yelp reviews to South City Kitchen for Sunday brunch.  The only disappointment was not being able to order a mimosa until 12:30 in the afternoon, which I guess is the local ordinance.  Everything else was fantastic.  It was literally freezing cold outside, but the inside of the restaurant was warm and cozy.  The host informed us that only patio tables were available - but that wasn't a problem because the patio was just as toasty as the main dining room.We started off with the fried green tomatoes appetizer.  I'd enjoyed this Southern delicacy many times in the past, but I'd never had them South City style: stuffed with goat cheese, fried in a light panko-like batter and rising out of a shallow pool of warm tomato basil sauce.  Outstanding, and the kitchen even split it into two plates to make it easier for us to share.After that, I went for the cheddar biscuits with sausage and gravy.  The biscuits stole the show - perfectly browned and crumbly, but not too dry or chewy.  The gravy and sausage made a great supporting cast.  I savored every last bite, knowing I'd need to spend an extra 30 minutes on the treadmill that evening.  My brother ordered the South City Breakfast and also loved it.  He allowed me to sample a bite of the thick, smoky bacon and the delicious savory grits.  The service wasn't the most attentive, with our server often disappearing for long stretches, but we certainly didn't feel rushed out of our table, even though the place was packed.  Overall, a great brunch."}, {"review_id": "kYLXJkyHbuLWpPf22-2hHA", "user_id": "4gLYNRedAeqmVv0j0hM-BA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Amazing lunch in Atlanta!

I loved it despite the higher prices! The fried chicken with mashed potatoes and collard greens were outstanding, and nothing was left on my plate. I loved that the collard greens were savory and the broth/gravy was divine! My friends didn't like it as much because they like collard greens with smoked turkey legs or some other meat. The atmosphere is upscale yet casual, with white table cloths and an excellent wine/beer/cocktail selection. The beet salad was delicious and I would highly recommend the sorbet for a lighter dessert. My tab came out to $73.35 for a cocktail (tequila picante), crab cake appetizer (to share), beet salad (to share), fried chicken, and 2 scoops of sorbet.

You can't go wrong with this spot as your place of dining. My go to appetizer is a southern staple, fried green tomatoes with goat cheese fried in them. You've never had anything like this . Nothing beats the cornbread muffins they bring out before the entrees come out. Nothing like fresh pieces of corn in your cornbread muffin. The only thing I've been eating upon each visit for the past few years is the farmhouse fried chicken. Nothing better than golden fried chicken with a bed of collard greens & mashed potatoes underneath.

The taste was reminiscent of a mozzarella stick because the base was marinara sauce. The tomatoes were also stuffed with goat cheese. We both ordered the Fried Chicken with collard greens and mashed potatoes. It took quite a few minutes for the food to come out but I didn't mind. I was too distracted by eating biscuits, cornbread and fried green tomatoes. The fried chicken itself was a beautiful dish. The food presentation is definitely top notch here. I don't know what sort of liquid was surrounding the chicken and potatoes but it tasted like nectar of the gods. The mashed potatoes and collard greens were the best I've ever had in my life.
