I was able to get there today because I had a meeting downtown.  I left so full, and sad that I couldn't finish all of my food.  I had a plate with a corn tamale - the best!  Perfectly sweet, a chipotle pork with astonishingly great flavor - this was the first bite I took, and I was taken aback by the incredible flavor in this, chili relleno - fantastic!  The best Spanish rice that I've ever had was included on the plate, along with a beautiful salad with beets - my favorite salad ingredient!  Everything came with salsa and chips, and beans, and tortillas!  All fresh, I can't think of a thing that would make it all better. The service was fast - we had everything in about 5 minutes, and the owner loves giving everyone a hug and personally checking on everyone to see how they like the food!  I will find any opportunity to make it here during the week.  I can't say enough good things about this place!  Bring cash, as it is cash only. It was a beautiful day, so we enjoyed the nice outside patio.  I will find an excuse to get back down here during the week soon!!"}, {"review_id": "5TB1fGy5bZFYoFZ2waRADg", "user_id": "psAjVE1E1XEYyZ4yTfcdYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "This place is only open for breakfast and lunch and they only accept cash. So if you can overcome both of those hurdles then this place is a must! The food is similar to the big Cafe Poca Cosa, but at a fraction of the cost. We came towards the end of the lunch rush and sat on the patio. We were brought chips right away which was nice. The chips and salsa were delicious! We ordered right away and our food was out in like 5 minutes! I ordered the barbacoa de res and it was soooo tasty and flavorful. Very juicy and packed with spices and stewed vegetables. The rice was probably the star! I think they said it was vegan rice, but vegan schmegan I don't care it was delicious! The beans were also not bad at all. Overall, this place is delicious! Can't wait to stop at an ATM and make a mad dash for this place again for lunch."}, {"review_id": "1WgdREjjZmq_fCEXfawKlA", "user_id": "Z6WD4uMWjx93wo4EzJZDQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So in love with this place! I've been going here for over 2 years. Good, fresh Mexican food! Cash only. There's a Wells Fargo ATM across the street. It's right beside the main library downtown so if you park in the library's garage, parking is free for the first hour. Great tamales! Super friendly staff! You will not leave without getting a hug. Very friendly restaurant with good food. Open Monday through Friday and they close at 2 PM"}, {"review_id": "8ggGVEq_TONPk8Y984_cFg", "user_id": "FQbrxtqDRTnIlL3EDheefQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "If you want to eat somewhere where everyone makes you feel special you should go eat somewhere else. If you want to eat somewhere where it all feels special then you've come to the right place. You can feel the love here. In the food, in the service, in the space, and in the big jar for donations for all the stuff they work to support down south of the border, and in the to go containers that go through the front door to the homeless. You'll never have a bad meal here. Be careful or they'll overfeed you. It's always bustling except when it's not, lots of times the music is loud and sometimes there are hugs. Be sure you throw a twenty in the jar and enjoy the company, the food, and the love. Eat your salad and your beans, you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "4ylGcP1agB-hF6BxDFu3hw", "user_id": "yQJ8va4iylSYa0Nf3bNCEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Wonderful casual, authentic breakfast and lunch spot.

You'll also have to bring your own straw too, if that's how you like to drink your beverage. They're unique and I applaud the restaurant for their \"green\" efforts. The food is delish and the service is fast - but I feel a little rushed whenever I'm there during the lunch hour. It's pretty loud and hectic and there's usually a wait. You can see from my photo that it's not a huge space. Not a deal breaker, I'm just trying to write a review that's helpful in regards to the atmosphere (and not only the food). Be prepared for a goodbye hug on the way out, from the owner, Sandra!"}, {"review_id": "N8cUWm8CGD4E5BrASENZ1A", "user_id": "5A1PuEBapd6G_f3VQVC3aw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/28/2017", "text": "If you are visiting Tucson this place is a must! If you live in Tucson and have not eaten here, what is wrong with you? The Little One is home! It represents Tucson with great food and when you leave the owner always gives our her warm hugs.

The service was excellent, so fast and very friendly.

While my sister and I were having breakfast, a gentleman came out of the restaurant and asked us, \"if we could spare some change.\" My immediate response was cold and rude. He went to the bench out front and within a few minutes Marcella came out with a container of rice & beans for the man. Her generosity was an opportunity for me to see things in a different light today. I was touched, I went to apologize to the man and make sure he had $$ for lunch. I went in to tell Marcella how moved I was by her level of compassion. She told me, \"everyone needs help sometimes and everyone deserves to eat.\" I donated some more $ and thanked her for what she had given me today. I truly believe this woman is here to help the community and care for the people around her who are less fortunate.I willlllllll return and thank you for your kind heart Marcella! We took our leftovers and found someone to enjoy them because of you!"}, {"review_id": "wmjKHJmq43B-SRai0pb3BQ", "user_id": "kA6H0FTukkmTXv5H3S9XCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2017", "text": "Little Cafe Poca Cosa is just as good as the big Poca Cosa but more intimate. They only accept cash and you aren't able to customize your orders- but why would you!? The food is great and the sign is true, HUGS when you come in and HUGS when you leave. If you don't like being touched than this is not the place for you. It is small, hence the name \"The Little One\" but it fits the ambiance. It is there for you to eat breakfast and lunch, not to stay and linger- hug, eat, enjoy, hug again and go about your day."}, {"review_id": "jXhM3x5WButpT5iiit6bbA", "user_id": "6Dwh99zbe_lhfOD4MiAM1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/25/2016", "text": "Incredible fresh and delicious food!!!
