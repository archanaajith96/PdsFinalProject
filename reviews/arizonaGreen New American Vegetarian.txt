The fries were a wee bit cold, but still tasty and I didn't want to wait for a refire. I learned there was fairly new staff on board and that's such a small detail that it's forgiven. I know if I asked, they would have happily remade them! The Spicy Po' Boy was good and messy!! Their wing sauce is my favorite, I probably won't order that sandwich again, just too messy for me. I prefer their Bufalo wings anyway (eaten with a fork)! My standard order includes the wings, definitely what made me fall in love with Green. The Sangria was large, slightly dry, not uber sweet, and had peach slices! They have other cocktails beside wine and beer, but I wouldn't expect a full bar. However, the cooler full of non-alcoholic bevs holds quite the variety! The Scottsdale location sells the tsoynami desserts inside, along with the full menu, while the Phoenix location shares a lot with Nami. Nami is the stand alone coffee shop where you'll find all the vegan desserts! Great vegan fast food, there are healthy options, but who wants that when you can get a Big Wac?! There's lots of indoor AND outdoor seating, the art lining the walls is local and can be purchased, it's counter service where they deliver to the table, booze, and desserts next door. Keep in mind that parking is limited and have patience with the parking lot, it's worth it!"}, {"review_id": "rtnW84ZXlT36VEYTQSoGMA", "user_id": "orGedaDULNwcpr4n6CRbbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Great concept!

It is my oasis in downtown Phoenix. I understand that the food here is not terribly healthy but it is INCREDIBLY delicious and all vegan (praise be to Jah!) As a vegetarian, I already eat pretty healthy so this place is always a treat for me.I would avoid the obvious lunch and dinner hours because this place is very popular. Also the parking lot can fill up pretty quickly so plan the timing of your visit accordingly.I don't really care for the salads here but I compare every veggie burger I eat anywhere to the outstanding BIG WAC (a vegetarian Big Mac) and I also love the buffalo wings, crab rangoons, and occasionally I get the tahini cole slaw. The same owners own Nami next door so on the rare occasion that I still have room in my belly for more, I'll get a s'mores tsunami from Nami as well."}, {"review_id": "AwOPV2jbdMV14XsGeUu9LA", "user_id": "ge_yqJd241NMPuyOS_J_LA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Love that there is a vegan place in Tempe! It is pretty simple decoration inside, but they do have a good selection of food. They have bowls and burgers and some sides like fries. We had the coconut curry  bowl and the Chinese ginger flavored one. I like the curry one, curry taste was mild. And someone was very hungry and got another \"Big Mac\", it was too salty. The bun looks sad, but tasted good.And they do have some beer and wine selection. When bf asked the counter boy for recommendation what's good. He mumbled and then he said he doesn't drink. Bf said that he hadn't been drinking for a long time. The boy said 'why start now?' Wow!! That clicked! Bf realized that he shouldn't drink under his condition now, and decided to keep record clean.

It was such an amazing dinner. They had so many different options on the menu, so it was hard to decide what to try. I ended up with the BFF, which is a mock chicken sandwich with cheese, jalapenos, and ranch, all vegan. It was incredible. The meal was a little pricey because fries were extra, but it was well worth it. (I am confused why they were called thyme fries, too, as they didn't appear to have thyme on them.)

You order at the counter, get a number and pick your own seat. Then, they bring our your food when it's ready! They have sitting indoors and outdoors. They also serve alcohol! On Sundays they are not open but next door Nami's is open for brunch. You can order your food at Nami's then head over here to grab a bloody mary or a mimosa. Bathrooms outside. Friendly staff.

This place is totally a gem worth finding. From the cool laid back bohemian-hipster atmosphere, to the friendly staff and great selection of eats, this place is off the charts. A lot of restaurants really try at this, and the bar was set high from living in Austin, and having a lot of that culture within an arms length, we were spoiled. However, I am looking forward to my next road trip just so I can try new things and eat great food while on the road. Locals you are truly gifted a wonderful vegan eat spot!

I had to bring the wings home because I was full of the Big Wac alone and the 2 cups of raspberry lemonade I had which by the way was delicious as well.

Phoenix actually has quite a few excellent vegan and vegetarian-friendly restaurants from the original True Food Kitchen (review: bit.ly/2BT7Zqn) to Fresh Mint in Scottsdale (review: bit.ly/2Diq8m4). I can see how a healthier diet could help you cope with all the dry heat down there, and Green appears to be one of the more popular spots down there since cars were circulating the funky-retro building on a regular basis in their futile search for an open parking space.I was lucky because I got there around 5:30PM having survived not only the rush hour traffic but also Seventh Street's infamous suicide lanes to get there. For a fully vegan menu, the selection was very home-style comfort food but obviously with a meatless twist like the use of grilled seitan for their Chicago Cheesesteak and mock chicken in their BBQ Sammie. I was immediately drawn to the $8.75 Peanut Chicken Salad since I could easily indulge myself in a bowlful of brown rice otherwise. It featured several pieces of mock chicken coated in a crispy texture, mixed greens, cabbage, carrots, green onions, and crushed peanuts.It was all tossed in a sweet peanut vinaigrette and topped with tortilla chips I probably didn't need (photo: bit.ly/2EJ518M). It was quite tasty though I assume it was not as low in calories as I was hoping, especially since there was a bit of peanut sauce in the vinaigrette that bordered on decadent. It was truly entree size, but I underestimated the portion (as usual) and ordered a $3.75 bowl of Vegan Chili on the side. This was also topped with plenty of tortilla strips which made me think I ate a bag of Doritos for dinner (photo: bit.ly/2DCfnbv). Since a place this organic wouldn't be caught dead with Diet Coke, I took advantage of the bottomless refills of the $2.25 Strawberry Lemonade which lent puckery sweetness to my meal.FOOD - 4 stars...tasty vegan comfort food that's quite fillingAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...funky vibe, nice patio, traffic hell on Seventh to get hereSERVICE - 3.5 stars...nice vegansTOTAL - 4 stars...another enticing meatless spot to check out in Phoenix"}, {"review_id": "mZhDhD2jUigB5PvIwB1cvA", "user_id": "5FAD2Yq7DLBQ_-ef1iDA-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Best vegetarian restaurant I have ever been to but weigh that with the fact that this is the first one I have visited.  :) I have wanted to try this joint for some time given they carry their version of a Big Mac, called the Big Wac and if I am going to try vegetarian I wanted to be doing it eating a Big Wac. In addition to my first visit, I brought my 74 year old father who also has never had a vegetarian meal and thought it would be fun for him to. As for our food experience, wow, if that was vegetarian grub, I am now officially a vegetarian. Everything we had was on point. The spicy wings were awesome. The sauce for the wings was what made it stand out. So flavorful. As for our Big Wacs, oh and with the thyme fries of course, it was a tasty meal.  Now don't get me wrong, it does not surpass the Mac as the flavor of real meat does carry weight but our Wacs were darn good. Tasty and as close to a Mac as one could ask. Could of used a little more sauce, if I am being picky. Overall, a real nice meal with a slightly higher price point. That seems to be par for the course though when eating anything that is slightly better for you. Will have another Big Wac in the future for sure."}, {"review_id": "D652Q2WFKqx1MC_yqkWfWA", "user_id": "r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Love Green!  I had the buffalo wings and the crab ragoons.

But it was good for what is was - diner type vegan food. We got the buffalo wings to share and I got the Big Wac burger. The buffalo wings were okay. It was slightly sweet and spicy. But, I didn't like the sauce runny. I wish the sauce was gooey and nicely glazed on the wings, but it was runny and the wings were just sitting in a pool. As for the burger, this was the best vegan burger I have ever had. The patty was the closest to taste and consistency to a real beef patty. BUT, I was so disappointed with the \"secret sauce.\" I could barely taste anything AND my burger barely had any sauce in it. The thing I detest the most is a dry sandwich.

Went here for the first time some weeks ago and went again today. Both times I got the Big Wac which seems to be their most popular item. I mean, I'd planned to try something different but after poring over the menu I just couldn't pass up the Wac again, as many of the other dishes sounded spicy and I didn't particularly want a spicy meal today for reasons I'll keep to myself :-)People-watching while waiting for the food to be delivered was interesting. This place definitely has a certain type of clientele. Flesh-colored yoga pants, tree-hugger sandals, tattoos even shittier than those you might see at Pita Jungle (which is definitely saying something), the rogue's gallery of patrons brought a wan smile to my face at least once a minute until lunch was served.The burger itself is surprisingly tasty. They lay on the pickles pretty thick, and it doesn't have much cheese or ANY tomato, but even so it was soft and delish. The fries were meh. They call them thyme fries, but I pretty much didn't see any thyme on them - maybe a few microscopic dots of green? But for the most part, just regular shoestring fries, maybe a bit drier than normal, and far from the best fries I've ever had.Great thing about the meal is that you somehow don't feel shitty afterward. After a regular Big Mac I'm filled with self-loathing. An hour after my Big Wac I was happily enjoying an afternoon coffee and feeling pretty good.If I could suggest one thing, it would be for these guys to pick different names for their menu items. Fun to read at first, but if McDonalds, Wendy's etc (they also have an item called \"Wendy's Pickle\") catch wind of their trademarks being used like this it could spell big trouble real quick. Maccas probably have more lawyers than employees! One whopper of a law suit (see what I did there?) could probably take this joint down. Plus it's difficult to say \"I'll have a big WAC please\" at the front counter without breaking out into a shit-eating puerile grin. Oh, and another suggestion - arrange more parking space. The parking SUCKS. Assholes parking on the left and right of the place make it almost impossible to manoeuvre anything bigger than a VW beetle around and out again. Good luck with your F150s, nouveau cuisine gourmands..Also, fix the fries. They're not worth the money you're charging for them.That all being said, I'll definitely be back! And MAYBE I'll try a new menu item next time round."}, {"review_id": "6IYZqZqGqkc1F3Kq6Z1uyw", "user_id": "aifGelrssPylK7ZiGKHVAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "After becoming a huge fan of vegan food with the opening of J. Selby's here in Minneapolis, I knew when I went down to Phoenix to visit my parents I had to try their predecessor Green New American Vegetarian. I got the Classic Burger without cheese and the buffalo wings, both of which were surprisingly cheaper than back home at J. Selby's. The burger was good, but average. I could tell it was a veggie burger unlike the Solo burger at J. Selby's where I couldn't tell at all. The burger was very reminiscent of a Boca burger in my opinion. The wings however, oh my GOD! I could have eaten five orders of those alone! They are easily the best vegan wings I've ever had and I still have cravings for them. I just wish they could tell me how they make their wings so yummy. I wish J. Selby's would forgo their cauliflower based wings for these. But then again maybe not as I would never leave.

The food is delicious and the atmosphere is extremely inviting. This last time was just unfortunate, we put in an order to go, go out to use the facilities. Come back and wait for our food. We begin to notice how people who came in after us were getting their food so we made a comment about that to the person we ordered with. She looked at us blankly went back into the kitchen and proceeded to run out food. 20 min goes by, nothing. 30 min goes by, nothing. She walks right by us a numerous amount of times so we decide to say something.They found our food and say, \"we called your name out 20 min ago.\" Hands us our now cold food and sends us on our way. Wow! What service?!?I wish there was an \"I apologize we were really busy and didn't notice that you've been sitting right in front of us for 30 min\" instead we were made to feel like it was our fault and sent on our way. A little disheartening for someone who goes out of their way from a different city to visit.

But I never had the chance to try Green until now.  I tried a good amount of things and highlight all the details below.  Jamaican Bowl Thing - Super fresh, brussel sprouts were fried just right. The sauce they use was a low toned sweetness that wasnt overbearing. The vinaigrette was a little too powerful in the first few bites, but subsided immediately after.  The crab ragoons were a freak of nature. Its hard to believe that it wasnt cream cheese or imitation crab fr that matter. It didnt necessarily have the fishy taste of the sea, but it was damn close. The sauce they give with it tasted like au jus! I could have ate a boatload of those things. The samosas were a solid option. They weren't as crispy as I like, but they had some flakiness, as well as a nice overall mouth-feel with the grease. Oddly enough, I wish the containers of dipping sauce were wider, as I had to break the samosa down for it to fit.  The chameleon taco had a great, bold flavor. I thought of it as a southwest flavor, even though I dont think thats what they were going for. The tempura batter taste was spot on for what you would expect on a piece of chicken. The eggplant and sweet potato are already soft, so they spill out of the tortilla fairly easily. As long as you eat this carefully, its worth getting.  They serve fresh fruit that tastes great, but I m annoyed that they only gave me pineapple and grapes. Im not asking for the Chiquita banana hat in my bowl, but Im expecting some type of variety. Maybe if they listed what fruits were actually available, I wouldn't have been as perturbed. Overall, I was quite excited with what I had.
