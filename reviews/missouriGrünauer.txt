The spice is pretty mild and blends perfectly with this dish. I'm not a super-foodie but I do love to eat and I'm savoring every bite! Highly recommended!!"}, {"review_id": "xnD64IICoCkoC3Osqof7GQ", "user_id": "Si8WSqvn4nY-Qrvb59fSiw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Good food, something different for us.The place has a fun atmosphere, good back ground music.

Service was good - attentive but not overbearing. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. He helped us pick up a great bottle of wine: a Blaufrankisch red wine (has the body similar a pinot noir and the peppery spice of a zinfandel). He was also on point to help us navigate a gluten free restriction. The food was delicious. To start: the asparagus and cheese plate. Both were excellent. The cheese sauce on the asparagus was amazing!  Note: make sure to ask about GF; there was flour hidden in the cheese sauce. Her loss and my gain.For the main, I had the jager schnitzel von schwein. I liked that the pork wasn't breaded. The pork was tender and cooked perfectly. The mushroom cream sauce was tasty and the spinach spatzle was to die for. It was rich, but not as heavy as it looked. The strip steak with the mushroom and onion sauce (zwiebel rostbraten) got rave reviews. The portions are large. Even with taking some home, we were too full for dessert. The tab was also very reasonable. I come to KC with some frequency and know this was not my last time in.

I was here on the regular when I lived in KC, and on trips back I always find myself making a visit. If I don't do full dinner, I'll go for a drink at Wunderbar. Either way, it's a great experience. Whether I'm sitting at the bar, at a table on the beer garden or in the dining room, service is always warm and friendly. Of course I like the food here, but it's the top quality service that I always praise most immediately after a visit. Good job, Grunauer staff.For food, I'm most always happy, too! The Austrian Dip is a nice twist on the classic, subbing in rye bread. It gives the sandwich an extra bite and I adore it. The fish sandwich is also always a winner. Those are my two go-tos, but I do always try and sub out a side of spätzle. For dinner, I've generally been here with groups. As a result I always insist on a few sausages for the table, and they never disappoint. I make sure we get a berlinerwurst and let my guests decide on the rest. They're always fantastic, so it's an easy decision. For entrees I lean towards the cordon bleu or the spätzle, though I've strayed and always been happy. Austrian food is pretty heavy, but once you've made peace with that, you'll enjoy your meal. Their steak dishes are particularly great.I couldn't eat here every day, or else I'd have a heart attack. But when I do visit Grunauer, I know that it'll be a reliably great experience."}, {"review_id": "zXUw1r7hqbmgbTdzVikLzg", "user_id": "PTjjAS5ILAwoHRgBm1Ifiw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "The staff was the best part of the visit the food not so much.

This place is the die Bienen knien (or what Google suggests is \"the bees knees\" in German, but don't quote me on that). I'm always weary to write my first review on a restaurant based solely off my experience during restaurant week, hence the caveat, because the experience can feel limiting, place is packed and resources may be spread thin, increasing the chance of an \"off night\" for the staff, and the menu is limited and portions can be small -- they need to make a profit somehow. BUT with that said, this place was phenomenal and executed exceptionally well. First, it was a four-course meal, most places typically do a three-course meal, and I left more satisfied than previous places due to the extra plate -- it really goes a long way. Second, these chefs know their craft and serve Austria well in recreating traditional dishes from there. Third, this is locally owned and operated by the Grunauer family (and you know I'm a sucker for local eateries). Fourth, it has European beer, if you're into that, and offer flights for you try, which I highly recommend.If you're nervous to try Austrian/Viennese cuisine, don't be. Seriously. You can't go wrong with this place. And the servers do an excellent job at breaking down the menu for you and explaining things thoroughly. I had about 50 questions and my server, Sean, was patient, friendly and answered them all enthusiastically. Lastly, all of their soups, breads, pastries, dressings, sauces are all made in house from scratch. P.S. If you have Celiac disease or are gluten sensitive, they offer gluten-free substitutes and meals."}, {"review_id": "vjcIw92fdyWFFseM9UcwCg", "user_id": "RU5zIJvz24dJ7YT6nIOs0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Absolutely amazing food!

Maybe it was my company (I was with an old college friend, who was getting the heck out of the Midwest and her friend, who looked at the menu and thought that only a hamburger sounded good), maybe we picked food items that weren't their strongest (although I do remember loving the kase spatzle), maybe it was an off day in the kitchen, maybe the owner was right and I had no idea what Austrian food is like (which he  condescendingly pointed out in a message to me about after I posted my first review, but he was probably right). That being said, I'm willing to eat my words and say that Grunauer serves some of the best Austrian food I've ever had (now that I actually have been to Austria) and provided one of the best dining experience we've had in the Kansas City area.We started with Wammerl, which was a beautifully done pieces of pork belly on a longer tooth pick with dumping and shallots with balsamic vinegar, which arrived with a basket of their delicious bread, including rye. Not too long afterwards our main dishes of the Hungarian goulash, the chicken cordon bleu, and the jaeger schnitzel and a dish of the kase spatzle to split arrived. Every dish was fantastic: the goulash was rich and velvety, with pops of paprika; the chicken cordon bleu was executed well and had all the elements that a cordon bleu has; jaeger schnitzel was fantastic, the pork was fork tender and mushroom sauce was beefy and rich, and went well with the bread dumpling that I subbed for the spinach spaetzel; and the kase spaetzel was delicious, too--creamy and cheesy with light and crispy fried onions on top. Along with our meal we had some delicious German dunkels. Their selection of German beers at Grunauer is great, but they also are happy to serve some local beers, as well.We finished our meal by splitting an apple strudel and their dessert special which was a poppy seed and almond torte. The apple strudel was done nicely, with the apple slices cut thing. The pastry had gotten soggy, which wasn't how we had it in Wisconsin, but was how our apple strudel in Salzburg was like, so maybe that's the Austrian way. Flavor was nicely balanced and was light and perfectly sweet. The poppy seed and almond torte was probably one of the best desserts we've had in Kansas City. It almost had a frangipane texture, and the little pops of poppy seeds with each bite were made it such a fun dessert to eat. This dish really ought to be a permanent part of their dessert menu.I hope you forgive me for my previous review, Grunauer. While I know that Grunauer definitely has a following, it deserves even more accolades and respect. It truly is one of the best restaurants in Kansas City."}, {"review_id": "UFHYos0xvPJicdU3tS6RmA", "user_id": "JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/23/2017", "text": "Had a good dinner at Grunauer on a Thursday night, but clearly not as good as most Yelpers, given the majority of the reviews.  We had dinner reservations for 7 but arrived early, around 6:30.  They were able to accommodate our early arrival with no issues.  We were seated in a very large dining room at a sort of half corner booth half table set up.  It was loud, as the place was full.  The artwork and wall coverings are worth the price of admission, it's appointed very well.We were immediately approached by someone to pour our water, and our server arrived shortly thereafter.  I sampled a few beers, some German, some local.  I would say Grunauer has a strong beer list, with an emphasis on Bavarian beers, as you would expect.  They had a decent wine list as well, but we stuck to beer.They bring you a bread basket to start, but I would recommend skipping it.  It's not that great, and it certainly is not as good as whatever you've ordered.To start, we had Wammerl, the fried pork belly dish, and 3 sausages:  andouille, kasekrainer, and tommyknocker bratwurst.  The appetizers arrived within 10 minutes of being ordered.  The Wammerl was out of this world good.  It's served with these dumplings and a balsamic reduction, but the real star is (of course) the pork belly.  Slightly crispy and paired well with the sweet reduction, I loved this dish.  I would absolutely order this again.The sausages were all strong.  Clearly, it's not Grunauer's first rodeo.  I would not get the andouille if you have children sampling the sausages.  It wasn't too hot for me, but it does have a bit of a kick, so be advised.  However, the kasekrainer is great for kids.  Cheesy and juicy, it was a table favorite.  To eat, I went with my German/Bavarian food standby:  Jaeger schnitzel.  Grunauer's is served with spinach spaetzle.  The mushroom gravy was textbook.  It wasn't too thick, but definitely had some body to it.  Also, it was seasoned very well.  No need for additional salt and pepper.  The dish comes with a serrated knife, but I did not need it.  It was fork tender.  This was a large meal, I did not finish it.  I also tried the weiner schnitzel.  It too was fork tender and had a very crispy coating.  I was missing the gravy, however.It was a very good evening at Grunauer, but not 5 star good for me.  That said, if I were to stay in this area again, I would absolutely eat here in the future."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gr%C3%BCnauer-kansas-city-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
