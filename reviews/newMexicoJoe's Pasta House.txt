Oh boy I tell you, it is a must go to restaurant for Italian/ Italian inspired dishes. Most memorable dish = calamari with olives...so many flavors, textures, tastes at once, make my taste buds and my brain go crazy - in a good way. I can't think of any negative thing to say about this place. You have got to try it and good luck beating the line."}, {"review_id": "T-w6qi7uaZhhUhY5XzZlig", "user_id": "5HJY_9LpiiBU14y_uErrKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Wow!  I don't know where to start. We recently attended a party that was catered by Joe's. We were impressed by the food, so thought we should check out the restaurant. Without going into great details about specific food items, I'll just say they have an amazing lunch buffet, which we ate from. I tried a bit of everything and made myself miserable (worth it)The staff was super friendly and made us feel very much at home. And last but not least, the prices are very reasonable. You could spend more on garbage at a fast food place. It is worth the 30 mile round trip fromour house to Joe's, and we will most definitely go again"}, {"review_id": "zb7xlPR6ozowmly3vvb0Sw", "user_id": "4B7s0IvKszRuQkrWbW36VA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "I LOVE pasta!... I should have been born in Italy, I love pasta so much so when it comes to Italian Restaurants I've patronized many. Joe's is my absolute favorite local Italian restaurant. From the impeccable service to the complimentary tomato bruschetta, bread and oil they bring to your table to the well-portioned, well-prepared entree and wine selection to the delectable desserts, if you still have room. Each time I try something different it's better than the last! I've had the salads, many of the pastas with almost every sauce - my favorites are the fra diavolo, the green chile alfredo and the pesto but the rest are just a good - and of course, the desserts (the cannoli is exceptional).You won't find a better experience and quality for your money.Yes, they do get busy, especially on weekends so expect a little wait but you'll always get the same great food and service plus a little extra, like featured foods, a live acoustic guitar player and maybe a nice house sangria."}, {"review_id": "i9aKKrYbYIxHUe6_BKd6KQ", "user_id": "hc5UpC8rrrG44x2Ejisqsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Checking Yelp again for local places and found this one.  Friendly and attentive wait staff.

As new arrivals in Placitas we haven't found Italian food that compares to our New York restaurants. I can't tell you how much we enjoyed Joe's pasta house tonite. Even though crowded we were promptly seated and received bread bruschetta and olive oil along with drinks. Katie was excellent and friendly our food was fresh hot and savory. While I would say the food is a solid 4 stars the service pushed my rating to 5. Try it!

We were both impressed with the sauces and the depth of flavor with both of our meals. To finish off our birthday celebration, we ordered a cannoli and it was delicious! The food was very appetizing and the service was excellent! All of the employees looked like they got along very well.

The Big Apple. The City That Never Sleeps. The Empire State.  Whatever you call it, to me it will always be the roots of my tree. The place I was born, where I spent the early part of my childhood growing up, and where most of Mi Famiglia still lives today.  Where we'd sit at the table alllll dayyyy longggg....together....over meat-a-balls as big as your head. Eggplant Parmigiana baked to perfection. Sauce that's been cookin' since dawn. The very thought of it puts me in a groove of emotion I can hardly contain....Today, as I dined at Joe's Pasta House in Rio Rancho, I was transported \"home.\" The Guzzardis have something very very special here, something that so many restaurant owners have lost touch with in today's fast paced world, and that's an authentic connection with their patrons. Here, you're family. No, really. I mean that sincerely. Here, Joe's always in the house. Here, you're going to break bread over fresh to order bona fide traditional Italian American cuisine created from a legacy of immigration recipes that have been been passed down from generation to generation. Sauces made from scratch every morning. Hand cut natural steaks. A staff that is truly invested in giving you the very best experience you could possibly hope for, and an ambiance that is so relaxing, I honestly did not want to get up from the table to leave. The meal was exceptional in every way...there is so much amore in every bite...you can literally taste the pride that went into the preparation.  The Francese Chicken Scallopini was cut beautifully thin, then dipped in egg & sautéed in a lemon butter white wine sauce with capers on a bed of pasta...absolutely phenomenal. The shrimp scampi was to die for, oozing with all that garlicky goodness and nestled on a bed of baby spinach. The house made bruschetta that is offered with their bread service...WOOOW...out of this world! I could have eaten a vat of it all by myself. The desserts: where do I begin?? The lemon cake literally melts in your mouth, sooooo unbelievably soft and bursting with flavor. The tiramisu was superb...the texture, the layers of flavor...fantastico! The mascarpone cream dessert, deliciously decadent. The cannoli....OMG, THE VERY BEST!!!!!! The cappuccino was the perfect compliment to cap off the meal.Let me mention something else about Joe & KC, they have such a tremendous passion for this community. Their heart, generosity and devotion, not only to the positive growth & development of their city and support of local non-profits, but their desire to see other business owners succeed is nothing short of inspirational.  Looking so forward to my return visit."}, {"review_id": "Pyt8mlzrHmadqIXh7ek1IQ", "user_id": "omYuq-EWw6v0K69HLUUcwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "This is my first visit to Joe's. Odd, since I live close to this establishment. And now that I've gone, I'm wondering why in heck haven't I gone before! I love this place! It has a very nice ambiance about it. The floors are  dark wood which exudes lushness. Seating is plentiful, although understand this is not a large establishment. You can expect to have a nice place to sit with your family and close friends, just don't bring along 200 of your closest friends. My wife and I went there for lunch and happened to catch their luncheon buffet, which I believe is only from 11 AM to 2 PM, most days. (Not Sunday and I think Saturday it only starts at noon.) We both had the tomato bisque, which was really delicious. I had penne with the meat sauce. That is perhaps the best meat sauce I've ever eaten at a restaurant. The meat balls were very tasty. I was pleased with the salad, as well. The staff were friendly and helpful. Attentive, but not overly so.My wife and I were privileged to meet Joe. He is a very personable fellow. You can see that he cares about his establishment and his patrons.This is absolutely a place to return to again and again. I eagerly look forward to when I return to Joe's again."}, {"review_id": "8TZKCuyP0EZV4BNzWJv2VA", "user_id": "APx20b9etKLY0HDovgSrMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/10/2016", "text": "Ziti Florentina. Ziti with spinach, mushrooms, tonatos in a lovely white while buttery and lightly garlicky sauce. This is among the best versions of this classic dish that I have tasted. The sauce is incomparable. The sauces are a Joe's Pasta House hallmark.-----04 Mar, 2013-----Baked Lasagna. -- One of the very best lasagnas in town. My guest for this meal loved the lasagna, and allowed that the sauce was better than most that he had ever had. This seems to be a hallmark of Joe's: all the sauces are superb. Fresh, tasty, and perfectly spiced, never in-your-face.-----04 Mar, 2013-----Carbonara -- Fettuccine (or Ziti -- my preference) pasta, green peas, red onions, and prosciutto in light pink sauce. Delicious, and very rich. My favorite version of this disk in the Duke City. Please have a glass of their very fine dark red Zinfandel. It complements the dish and stands up very well to the carbonara spicing. Lightly tannic with a terrific finish.-----17 Jan, 2012-----So you order calamari in an Italian restaurant and it usually comes out deep fried with a boring red sauce on the side, right?Try Joe's Mediterranean Calamari when it's on special. If it isn't, beg for it. Maybe Joe and Kassie will make it part of the regular menu. Fried Calamari topped with Warm Feta Cheese, Capers Artichoke Hearts, Red Onions and Calamata Olives in a Lemon Butter Sauce. Outrageously good.-----29 Jul, 2010-----Like an Old Italian Friend..... If you have been here, chances are good that Pasta House proprietor Joe Guzzardi will remember you as soon as you walk in the door. On my second visit, he allowed that it being a crowded Friday evening and we were without reservations, there would be a long wait for a table. Then he remembered me, saying \"I remember you. [Must be my unforgettable voice.] You been here two months back. Follow me, I got a table for you.\" And so it goes at Joe's Pasta House. We enjoyed our first visit so much that we returned with our gastronome friends of some 40 years, Sally and Andy from Taos. Good choice, they said. The menu lists many standard Italian dishes as well as house specialties, mostly pastas. None of us got beyond the pastas. We had, at various times: Southwestern Shrimp Fettuccine -- Jumbo shrimp with green chile, crushed red peepers, and parmigiano cream sauce tossed with fettuccine pasta. Delicious.  Carbonara -- Fettuccine pasta, green peas, red onions, and prosciutto in light pink sauce. Delicious, and very rich.  Ravioli Rustica -- Round cheese-filled pasta in a tomato cream sauce with Italian sausage and fresh herbs and spices. Wonderful. Traditional Gnocchi -- Potato gnocchi topped with tomato sauce, served with meatballs and Italian sausage. Gnocchi is among Jane's childhood favorites. This may be the best she ever had. The service was exemplary. Everyone knew our name. Joe kept stopping by making sure that everything was OK (it was better than OK, Joe). Alas, Bob Morris, the Italian opera baritone is no longer here. Joe told me that Bob had relocated to Florida (their gain; our loss). There is now a gifted guitarist playing cool, soft jazz. Fine sound. See you again, Joe. Soon as my waistline will allow.
