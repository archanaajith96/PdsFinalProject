Some of their crepes have interesting ingredient combinations. The first time, I had just a plain banana and nutella, just to familiarize myself with the place. The second time, I went for one of the interesting ones. I'm not quite sure exactly what was on it but I do remember arugula, egg, bacon, and some sort of chipotle sauce. Delicious!The best part is the hot chocolate (although, I tend to always think hot chocolate is the best part of places)! Definitely recommend, especially on a cold, Wisconsin day."}, {"review_id": "izM2_si2q1b0d-_1cARhiA", "user_id": "yb3_gexBB11mUwPtQhoiEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This place has become a favorite for me, just gets better over time. I and my dining companions have never been disappointed with anything we ordered here. Really great first date spot. The tea selection has dramatically improved in the past few years, they poached some staff from Dobra, and OOHH boy is their tea amazing. The service seems to be getting better and faster over the years, it was good to begin with, but now its A++."}, {"review_id": "HopeRNsRJKIkPetWvFilTg", "user_id": "wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "Crepes, coffee, cozy. If you're in a rush, that's all you need to know about Bradbury's. The basics: crepes are their focus, and there's both a sweet and savory menu. The menu rotates and often reflects what's available at the farmer's market and in season. Their recent special was perfect for fall - a pumpkin-filled crepe with candied pecans and an apple cider reduction. It wasn't overly sweet and the pumpkin puree was allowed to shine without being doused in a ton of spices or sugar. I can't have caffeine, but multiple friends swear Bradbury's has the best coffee in Madison. I've really enjoyed their hot apple cider when I've ventured past water for my beverage - it almost has a creamy quality to it that I can't figure out how they accomplish, but thoroughly enjoy.The walls are windows so it's always bright and benefitting from natural light. WiFi has been reliable when I've used it. My only complaints are that the triangular layout leads to some tight squeezes when it's busy, and the seating is all really, really low. I'm a short person and I feel like I'm sitting on the ground; I'm not sure how those in the average to tall range fare on the long trip down to the kindergarten stools.That said, the changing menu and sunny room makes a great stop anytime between breakfast and dessert."}, {"review_id": "6XPJvfcR5D9ThDKb_35MkQ", "user_id": "5IMW9RYnfg-plRaz316QKg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Got a 2% latte here.

I generally love Bradbury's. I only marked off one star because of the cons: it's a small space (not a lot of seating, and most often, the seats that are available are backless stools) and their little pastry selection (most often, they'll have 1-2 ready made pastries available)."}, {"review_id": "70PwHIJZjnQHpjPYL5Ij1w", "user_id": "wmeEjGSPa9FT6phBBhBjOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Delicious, savory crepe and a sublime cafe latte.

I give it a four and a half star for the great food and vibe. Only half a star short because it is a very small venue, which means waiting in line at peak hours. We went in around 3 for late lunch, and the place was still full. The savory crepes were exquisite, thin and soft, yet crisp on the edges. We really loved the smoked salmon crepe. Highly recommend!

We especially enjoy having the buckwheat crepes which I think they do for the savory ones. The coffee is usually quite good and service is always really friendly. The only drawbacks are the space is sometimes cramped as it is a small seating area and a popular spot. Also, the savory crepes can be a little steep on the wallet ($9-$11ish), although somewhat understandable given the use of fresh, local ingredients."}, {"review_id": "Iy3z1R1l1bsgdaSxestnDw", "user_id": "TLfPE6i585kzij24qUsmpQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/22/2017", "text": "Skip the coffee; come for the savory and/or sweet crepes.I was looking forward to eating here--the place is a bit small. Luckily, we were able to snag a spot at the edge as the center table was taken. There was plenty of natural lighting with the numerous windows, and is an excellent spot to take food photos. Coffee was lackluster and tasted not fresh. As for the crepes, they were light and crispy--you could really taste the egg in the sweet version.Service was quick and you can see them make your crepe(s) in the kitchen which was pretty neat. Price-wise, it's a little bit on the higher side for the savory crepes but was well worth it and to be expected. The sweeter crepes are more reasonably priced. Overall, it was a good spot to check out if you are craving crepes."}, {"review_id": "knFXNHOsFkdJj6sFzN2XXQ", "user_id": "XmUoErm8KkfP_ti71nXgAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/4/2017", "text": "Fantastic coffee. They serve up Kickapoo among a few others. Friendly staff, excellent tunes. It's a bit of a smaller spot and the bar stools aren't anything I'd want to sit and linger and linger in but this is a great place to grab a cuppa joe. They make their scones and muffins in house. They had a few different choices including both sweet and savory. My bacon, cheddar and scape scone was warm out of the oven and very good. The bf had the ham, arugula, egg and mustard crepe which he enjoyed. I'm looking forward to coming back to indulge in a sweet crepe sometime-I'm looking at you lemon curd crepe."}, {"review_id": "d9ibgk6yL-TR3pR5pM3W_g", "user_id": "TBFTmpEOZGZAqcbTVtVWcQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "Went here today with my friend and my girlfriend and I'd say it was a pretty fun experience in a neat place.

We came around 10am on a Saturday morning, and they were super busy- there was only short line to order coffee, but all the seats were already taken (since this is a small spot) and people were busy enjoying their breakfasts. It only took a few mins for them to make our coffees, and we tried:-Cold Press Coffee (16 oz/$2.90, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Yum- really smooth and good depth of flavor without being bitter. Highly recommended!-Pourover Coffee (Kalita, $4): Also solid, and very smooth without an acidic finish.Both the coffees we tried were very smooth, and I would definitely come back for more caffeine if in Downtown Madison. The breakfast items also looked really good, so I would want to check that out also.

Tried the nutella crepes and Bradbury's espresso, they were spot on! Certainly my best crepe in Madison (seems not so much Crepes shop around the downtown). Staff were extremely nice and friendly. Folks who are here for a chat or on their own working, seemed decent. The music were not too loud and quite a good selection. I enjoyed the view to the outside quite a lot.
