That's what I can say about the flavor. This place seems more of a meeting spot for downtowners than it does a legitimate place you want to go to please your taste buds. It kinda tastes like a place where people who don't season their food like to go. For example, fried green tomatoes were coated in corn meal. Just corn meal - no seasoning. The grilledChicken breast wasn't seasoned either. The slaw was pretty good, but it says a lot when that's the best thing on your plate. Nice atmosphere, bland-ish food. I won't be revisiting."}, {"review_id": "wU1sLqpvtfGEHs7Z9qcPOA", "user_id": "eG1Tur78lGPRLPysNSzadQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Nothing to see here....just your every day southern magic. Absolutely. Delicious. Food. Perfectly fried chicken and velvety mashed potatoes all smothered in a taso gravy good enough to swim in. A succotash that might be as tasty as the chicken itself. How does one get a vegetable medley to be as satisfying as crispy fried chicken? I have no idea. I swear they can cook in their sleep down here. I can certainly get used to this. What I'll never fully understand is why I have to pay for an appetizer back home, what they charge for an entire entree over here. To put it in perspective, there's no southern fare being served within 75 miles of Boston that tastes better than this $12 plate of down home goodness. I guess you can't have it all...."}, {"review_id": "HqtBRdBhi9rkLKMyUagByA", "user_id": "8YwDTep-Z_4Jk47A4NqS5w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I tried one of the specials, which was a pork steak. It wasn't cooked well enough, so I sent it back which I never do. It came back with a slight char on it that gave it a little of that burnt bitterness, but much better than we had started.

Were greeted upon entering and exiting, clean, and great atmosphere. I had the catfish and fried green tomatoes, spouse had the chicken and potatoes with sausage, all the food was ok, my fish could have used more seasoning tho, the greens had to much vinegar. Bartender service was on point, I had the punch which was tasty. I really liked the attention to detail with presentation, our waiter could have been a little more friendlier. I didnt really feel the warm hospitality as I did in Cellar on the Greene which is next door.Good experience overall, I will give it another try at a later date..."}, {"review_id": "lVHuZZnMafnRdOSlVx_e8Q", "user_id": "AWhcuOk3tBJvo22WsmeY2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Absolutely loved this Place!  Everything was outstanding: oyster appetizer, Shrimp and grits, and   salmon!  Service was top-notch!  We will be back and will recommend to friends!"}, {"review_id": "W1LcDYzOjAAP7d5T5fGCEQ", "user_id": "NWS0vCCKlMkLua4D3FBLrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Great southern spot on the out skirts of campus. I have only been for business lunches but hear there dinner menu is equally superb.

Valet parking is offered but you can self park in the lot right outside closest to the train tracks. Quick and attentive service in a clean environment adorned with art for sale from area artists.The fried green tomatoes satisfied my craving and were delicious. The fish (catfish) and grits were great and came with a tangy coleslaw. It was edible but not my favorite. My host was on point and provided the type of service you don't mind tipping for.There is a wine list available and promotions on various days for dinner specials and bottles of wine. This is a great spot for after dinner drinks or just a chill spot for reading at one of the outdoor tables.If in the area I was revisit."}, {"review_id": "NhfAyb1ctntfb7_BZxQBRA", "user_id": "i4Qtnma_nOID-LqgdYxNnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "I had seen the great reviews here on Yelp of Mr.Friendly's and wanted to give it a try. It is kind of tucked back down a small road (the road after the railroad tracks) just before Cellar on Greene. I came on a Thursday evening for dinner, there was no wait for a table.  Our server was on it at all times and was very friendly and knowledgeable. I got the pecan crab cakes and they were delicious, some of the best I've had. It had pimento-horseradish remoulade, grilled corn-vidalia \"salad\", creamy stone-ground grits, and sautéed veggies. I don't even like grits and would not normally eat them, but these were fantastic and it changed my mind about grits. My friend got the salmon and she loved it. I tasted it and wow, let me just say it was \"melt in your mouth\" salmon.  The atmosphere here is very romantic, artsy, upscale but also relaxed. They have art work hanging all over the walls, which I believe is all done by local artists. This would be a great date night place, but me and my gal pal came for dinner and enjoyed it just as much. I will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "CWe2ifYI-yEDYDXZVMb6AQ", "user_id": "dXCcQD7RyStWmmG-8hkiPA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update.... still not up to 5 stars yet.

This place lives up to the hype.We decided upon the fried shrimp as our appetizer, which had about four large-sized shrimp. They were absolutely delicious, and served alongside a tasty peach chutney.For dinner, we had the shrimp and grits and pork tenderloin. Both were spectacular - the grits had a heavenly gravy, and were perfectly seasoned. The pork was extremely tender, and the sides were equally great! Our server was incredibly kind, informative (she steared me in the direction of the gravy option for the grits), and super attentive. A great night with some super tasty food."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-friendlys-new-southern-cafe-columbia?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
