We got the chicken saag, madras coffee, muligantwany soup and I was craving fish, so with the owner's recommendation, I went with the fish curry. We got a level 7 spice and our dishes were literally just filled with spice and barely any flavor. My fish was pretty bad. It tasted...sweet. Which was very very weird because fish curry is NOT supposed to be sweet. I threw it out after eating like two bites of it. The saag tasted frozen. The only redeeming thing was their coffee, which was strong. I will totally go to BayLeaf because their food was way fresher, and the taste was so much better. Skip this Indian place and go to the other one"}, {"review_id": "NHHtNGIgIXVa8OOzLDZSsw", "user_id": "Qm01-W350qdvc-o6j28WAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Nice starter (Papad), excellent place for date, also serve buffet everyday from 11:00 am till 2:30 pm with goat curry and gulaab jaamun.

Chicken afghani, great! Mango Lassi, perfect. All I'm saying is, my friend who made the Indian food for my wedding also loves coming here when she doesn't feel like making it herself. And she's an amazing cook so that's high praise. We have ladies lunches here quite a few times a year and everyone enjoys themselves. The atmosphere is nice, the selection of dishes during the lunch buffet is good, and you don't have to be shy about asking for fresh hot naan.

The food selection and quality are above reproach in every respect. Be sure to make a reservation or come early as the restaurant fills up fast. Good on-tap beer selection and plenty of fun to be found in the myriad of naan choices.

I've been too scared to try Indian food without someone guiding me, so I enlisted the help of my native friend and I chose the very item that he didn't explain to me haha! I got the chicken afghani( it was a sweet mango sauce, which I got spiced up (level 9 out of 10). I'll say that Indian spicy is pretty spicy. I wasn't nose dripping or sweating, but my lips and tongue were burning.The garlic naan and regular naan were warm, crisp, and soft.  The mango lassi was like a mango smoothie, but the serving was only like 8oz, so it was gone in like three sips. Everything looked appetizing and the smells were all great. Service was fair - got everything we asked for. The prices were all very, very fair.  Entrees ranged from $12-17. Overall, no complaints, it was a very pleasant experience. I'll definitely be back to try other items!"}, {"review_id": "IJ3aqhSaZTajo4RiTHWi8g", "user_id": "TVTQY4_OdrXD8-YttwJrWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "I really enjoy coming here to get Indian Food.

I Love Indian food and as such go there at least once a month. I honestly have no specific go to meal, always depends on how I am feeling.

I used to look forward to enjoying an outstanding spicy lamb korma here - and that dish used to be one of the best I'd experienced in the states. A change in chefs early this year resulted in serving a dish that was nowhere near the superb flavor and texture of their previous version. While I tolerated the lesser version for a few more visits, tonight was the last straw when the new waiter not only did not recognize the dish that I had been ordering for several months there, but after consulting with other staff, came back to tell me that they were actually out of lamb. The silver lining in this is that I paid my bill for my glass of wine and drove another 5 miles outside of the city to discover Bay Leaf Indian Restaurant. While still not quite as tasty as what India Palace *used to* be - I find it's now the better of the two options in Montgomery."}, {"review_id": "OSJDwOuaRz9UK_NW4avA8w", "user_id": "XNPwLVwHPyrOaEQA_sI1wg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2016", "text": "Don't you hate it when you place a to go order, get there and food is not ready? Well, that wasn't at all the case with India Palace! Good was timed perfectly and everything was ready quick. Being located in some random strip mall, it's a pretty typical spot to find an Indian restaurant. Hey, that beats having one in an office building basement, I've somehow had a chance to experience multiple of those and trust me, the smell of Indian food and office are just not a good combination.Anyways, Chicken 65 was decent, but to be frank I wasn't a big fan of their preparation. I've had many before and here, it was just too saucy, didn't have enough kick for a spice level 7 and wasn't served with fresh onions on the side. I think that dish needs some work here.Tandoori nann was made just right and the chicken tikki masala was great as expected. Overall, it's a spot I'd return to. I liked the interior also, it was a place you could take a date too if they are into Indian food."}, {"review_id": "qjhV6EZQzIWj3IXIaAKYbQ", "user_id": "Yq6CacU306U8ZtTgOnKkCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2016", "text": "Love the butter chicken!
