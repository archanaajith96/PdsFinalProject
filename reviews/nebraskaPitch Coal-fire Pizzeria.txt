With a separate entrance, guests are wandering about the restaurant, trying to find the elusive 'private room' tucked away in an obscure corner. A dedicated bar in the back ensures that your guests are doing their due diligence in running up a bar tab that can easily exceed the cost of food.With Dean's help we offered a limited menu for our guests - casual appetizers, salads served family style, short rib or pasta (with veg and/or chicken), and two dessert options. Of course, pizza options for the kids (leftover pieces \"cleaned up\" by the menfolk) with limitless Shirley Temple's. From the room itself, to the food, to the service, rave reviews from all of us. If you're looking for a private, party room that seats about 40, I highly recommend this option."}, {"review_id": "jD4ZZ-3a5DUAs50Ce1ZkNA", "user_id": "XK5e1Q8iIylKiz4V_POlwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I absolutely LOVED Pitch.It was my first time here and just looking over the menu I found several vegan options. We tried the brussels sprouts appetizer (they have two, one vegan and one not) which was amazing. We also tried their truffle fries (vegan without parmesan) which were....also amazing. And lastly we made our own pizza with mushrooms, roasted garlic, and fresh basil with red sauce and no cheese and it was DELICIOUS, seriously so good. I had not a single complaint about Pitch, our server was friendly and attentive, our order was accurate which is great because we had a large group of us, and even our drinks were delicious.You can tell Pitch uses quality ingredients and cares about what they do. I'm just waiting for the day to go back and try their other vegan options, although it may be a while since it is definitely a more expensive restaurant, but you get what you pay for!!Delicious food, tasty drinks, and great service. Can't wait to go back and visit again!"}, {"review_id": "sEKJEP0_h2pqw1R1Ws_UlA", "user_id": "5JpvIWhtaaSr8rrE7keK6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Each visit to this mainstream locale has been the same. The same quality of food. The same adequate service. The same ambience. The same crowd. Their menu is also fairly constant with a few seasonal changes. Our kids enjoy the pizza while we enjoy a glass or two and the occasional server offer of an off menu chef creation or just our usual and some. Pitch Pizza: crispy with reasonable topping to dough ratio - it's not meh nor is it stark raving. Burger: Our kindergartener loves it. It's a burger but they are not a burger place so why get the burger. Salads: I love their wedge and order it every time. Simple, straight forward and classic. Arugula salad, roasted beet salad; ok so there have been times I order a different salad - they have always been good but the wedge calls to me... I think I hear her now. Charcuterie: pretty good but depending on the plate offerings and all the other charcuterie options on the street we do not always opt for this and would not label it a charcuterie destination. Starters: Truffle fries, onion rings, meatballs, Brussels sprouts - you cannot go wrong here. I'm not a fan of truffle oil but have found a way that lacks all ladylike dining etiquette to accept it on their frittes. More than occasionally we order a pizza and dim sum the starters. Pitch is a dark, vibrant, family ok spot to hit up and if you're up for long list of drink options and some food to pair it with you won't be terribly disappointed. Next date night we may stray from dim summing the menu and go for traditional dinner plates. Also, I hear it's good for brunch but so far that hasn't been powerful enough to motivate on a Sunday AM."}, {"review_id": "3ANXJY_VqHTdx8JyGhgfPA", "user_id": "4aby2q3uyeiJUsBbtuEu7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Always love Pitch.  Dundee is the best but West is cool too since Lacey works there.  The meatballs are always an absolute must !   I've never had anything I didn't enjoy!!  The POW and the WOW can be super amazing too !   Scriptown makes an amber ale just for Pitch !  Super tasty !"}, {"review_id": "kJmrYkdsQpnX5Zb9mxb1DQ", "user_id": "31cJ7Fwm-4A0SVFetaVa5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Looking for a great place for late lunch or early dinner Pitch is the place.

I was in the area and met up with my friend for a late dinner. We got a bottle of the Pitch Black which was fruitier than I prefer for a red wine. We got the meatballs to start which were really good. The focaccia bread that came with was delicious! We also got the Biaco Verde pizza. Prosciutto, arugula, ricotta cream, and caramelized onions. It was really good, but I was not a big fan of the onions, but that's just a personal preference. Our server Jennifer was fantastic.

They do everything well and the service, atmosphere, and food are all top notch. As others have said, be sure to have a reservation or be prepared to wait for a while on busy weekend nights. I got the wings (sweet and spicy rosemary), pizza (Mia), and the meatball sliders. I really love the Pitch wings and I think they are some of the best in Omaha. They really aren't overpriced either, at about $1ish per wing (fairly standard for any decent wing place). Sweet and spicy and slightly crispy, I get them every time. The Mia pizza is good but nothing mindblowing. Just a good, solid pizza with flavorful ingredients. You can add fried eggs to the Mia as well, which adds an extra layer of fat/richness if that's your thing. The meatball sliders are okay/decent but I probably would not get them again. Overall, Pitch does most items well. I have yet to have a dish that truly disappointed me. While they are a bit more mid-range in terms of price, I think that it is still decent value (1 pizza should still be able to fill two people up, generally). Happy hour adds to the value as well."}, {"review_id": "gGQKwKG0xGLsjdD8TVYIwA", "user_id": "UaPKX1z-pAl7gegTK6DfyA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "Amazing vibe on the inside. Great design and super lively. One of the coolest spots that our friends took us to on our trip to Omaha.

Tip: If you or someone is vegan or sensitive to lactose, they're more than willing to make a pizza without cheese.

Pitch has stayed consistent in terms of food, service, atmosphere, and ambiance over the years. It has increased in popularity significantly, so while you could once come in during a rush hour and snag a table or a short wait, now the wait time will be much longer if you dont have reservations. Fri. Sat, Sun, you HAVE to have reservations or come on an off hour if you want to be seated immediately. Even the bar area fills up to standing room only during their busy nights. I recommend take out, which is something I have been doing a lot of recently. I find the food is not quite as good (fries a little soggy and not as hot, or pizza just not quite as perfect due to sweating in the box) BUT it will still fulfill that craving and you can eat it in the comfort of your own home. In sweatpants! I really like that the food is very very consistent here. I can count on almost every menu item to be prepared exactly how I remember it- and I have tried almost the whole menu at this point. My favorite chopped salad is now on the permanent menu and not just served at lunch which is a huge plus (and gripe in my previous review). I still love the truffle frites and the 2 peps pizza. Added to my favorites are the meatballs [the come in a few dishes, the sub, spaghetti, and as an appetizer] and the lobster mac and cheese. They often have specials for the day that are also innovative and yummy.Still one of my favorite restaurants in Omaha."}, {"review_id": "tHe2S4ZeeiI8NQMsDkBefA", "user_id": "Fy5QYxVM7miOfzjR_N1raQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "A hip pizza joint that has great drinks and tasty pizza.

There were a lot of things that went wrong with our service and I felt so bad for my friend to have such luck, on her birthday too. To list a few things that went less than ideally:1. Some friends arrived earlier to give birthday balloons and a flower bouquet to the host to place at our reserved table, but it was placed at the wrong table. 2. We had to disturb the table of nice people about the misunderstanding of the balloons and flowers to take it away from them. 3. Seated half an hour after our reservation, ironically in the empty, except for 2 occupied tables, newly expanded space next door (the hangriness was setting in at this point). 4. We also brought a cake for them to store until the end, but they got excited and cut the cake before we were able to stick candles on it and sing (there is a fee for \"open food\" which was ~$10). 5. The room we were in was chilly and we weren't able to fit everyone on one table because they were bolted to the ground, so we couldn't even push the tables together.  Overall, disappointed with how organization was handled and the lack of communication. Apart from the service, everyone seemed to enjoy their food. I ordered their arugula salad which I've gotten in past visits and the presentation of it never ceases to wow me, and my friends, who were also intrigued by its beauty. Everything about this salad makes me happy with my favorite part being how well the candied walnuts amplify the nuttiness of arugula, while also adding extra crunch to a dish of leafy greens. Other dishes we ordered include the Bianco Verde pizza (basically my salad served in pizza form), Shrimp Scampi, Tagliatelle Bolognese, and of course, it wouldn't be complete without their Truffle Fries. My friends weren't too impressed with their shrimp scampi, as the sauce was too rich and greasy. I tried some of my friend's tagliatelle and really appreciated the lavish width of the noodles that were also cooked to a perfect al dente. So although, the service was sub-par, the food made up for some of it. So is it worth it to dine here? Although we were unlucky this time around with our reservations, I've had better experiences in my past visits so don't let the service deter you. The servers were apologetic, friendly, and frequently ran back and forth from the main restaurant to check up on us. I don't really care for their pizzas here even though they're a \"pizzeria\" but surprisingly really admire their truffle fries and arugula salad for their high quality presentation that reflects just how good they taste too. So in this case you CAN judge a dish by the way it looks! It might be best to dine in smaller group (4 is good) and that way you can share entrees to cut down on cost, as most of the dishes here average ~$20. Parking can be complicated and is usually based on timing and luck if you want a spot closer to the restaurant. Otherwise if you don't mind walking a short distance, parking stalls that line underwood avenue are all fair game, including the clinic parking lot, so as long as it's after 5pm."}, {"review_id": "NTO7vWiIMCbWQ4H8FIySLA", "user_id": "--2HUmLkcNHZp0xw6AMBPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "This pizzeria is incredible.  Handmade sausage and hand rolled pastas.  Best pappardelle and tagliatelle in the city.  There bolognese sauce is bellissimo.  You cannot leave this place without trying their incredible iceberg wedge and house red and white sangria.  My new fav.  Also, great space for parties, and meetings.  It's my new go-to.  Must check out!!"}, {"review_id": "SYCFr2mGASDBjrxcL503TA", "user_id": "tLe7a9lVWBJMeTNr5Nbl7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/3/2017", "text": "Very lively high energy restaurant with huge selection of a variety of eclectic dishes.  I loved the interior design and layout with open kitchen and a large seating area in the center.  Ordered a variety of appetizers which were all great and were presented very well.  I ordered the pork chops which had a nice peppery crust yet tender and juicy.  Dish was accompanied by potatoes on the side which were crispy and fluffy on the inside.  All in all, a great dining experience!"}, {"review_id": "ghnqjuoGdQX07QH4VnVEMQ", "user_id": "qAffLpiQCJF7q5IogUwz8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Pitch really does have some great food.
