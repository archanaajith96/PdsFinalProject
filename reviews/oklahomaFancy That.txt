Came in around 11am on Mother's Day too so the wait may not always be that bad. We liked the food and had good service. Second time back. Got a table easily around noon. So if you have a late start remember Fancy That is open for brunch until 2:30pm. I got the New York Steak Benedict which was cooked perfectly and went well with the asparagus. The potatoes that came with were a little over seasoned for me. But last time I remember them being better. Chalking that one up to a slight error in shaker operations today."}, {"review_id": "8SyGxc9s2EmF8UmF1lLyGg", "user_id": "XWIMObor_egb8nwYEsH5fA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Steak and scrambled eggs was fantastic.

Such a cute and eclectic restaurant. Fairly small maybe seats 20? Went for a business lunch and it was perfect. EVERYTHING freshly made! Salads were great, taco outstanding, chicken sandwich so many great flavors and the salmon was awesome! I think they have a lot of regulars because I heard the waitress ask 2 tables if they wanted there usual! I could see this place being great for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner!"}, {"review_id": "PuAduEVs79kMP-6MbR52-g", "user_id": "m-IZMSO_Y-tG9PLJE18Plg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/21/2017", "text": "Three words: Blackened Salmon Benedict. Searching for a brunch place that didn't have a ridiculous wait on Mothers Day was nearly impossible. Thanks to their Yelp reviews, we decided to check Fancy that out and were very pleased.Every table was packed but they did have a couple of seats at the bar which were first come first serve! Score!I ordered the blacken salmon Benedict and it was def top 3 of my favorite Benedicts. The eggs were perfectly poached and the salmon was seasoned and cooked just right. Sometimes fish gets overcooked and dried out but this was not the case. Every item on the plate complimented each other.  And before I knew it I cleaned my plate!In a previous review it was mentioned that it's not a place where you go to get a huge portion and get crazy full. The portion was just right to leave me satisfied and not fall into a food coma afterwards. Kinda pricey as far as food to $ ratio goes if you're used to getting a Grand Slam from Dennys for $8 but the food is fresh, cooked to order, and delicious.Can't wait to return to try their lunch items."}, {"review_id": "zYi8J3RLfU-MtLriPGYVrA", "user_id": "GtoxVjUoTZujL5JFMo8Bdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Amazing food!

The service was fair. The atmosphere was kinda \"ugh\".  Just to get the \"ugh\" out of the way... with fear of sounding extremely snobby here...the overuse of tacky Halloween decor was just annoying to me. The whole place could just use a deep cleaning, as well. The food was definitely good, though. I enjoyed my breakfast burritos. The husband loved his smothered steak and eggs. I don't know that I would go out of my way to return, but I would still say the food was worthy of 4 stars."}, {"review_id": "5gJl9cmctMRgx8qvVMn6MA", "user_id": "lej3xrHw7BHaXXf30fSfxw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Lackluster Sunday brunch experience. We went here based off the short morning wait and good Yelp reviews, but were pretty disappointed. The atmosphere was definitely meh... uncomfortable mix of seats plus Harry Potter was playing on the T.V. instead of the Master's? The worst part was the terrible service! The waiters just huddled up to talk at the counter, and we didn't get checked on a single time in our 90 minute dining time (we only stayed this long because our breakfast took 45 minutes). I had to go up to the bar and ask another waiter to bring our check. Unfortunately, the food wasn't worth another visit either. I got the Louisiana po-boy which was alright, but the eggs were overcooked. I was most disappointed by the \"jalapeno cheese grits\" - maybe a sprinkle of cheese on them and no jalapenos/spice to be found. There's a lot better breakfast places in Norman to try before this spot."}, {"review_id": "NpvgOaEEZBvnhB0gGbR0uQ", "user_id": "T9Qf-S6FmnztCvTz0YlHxw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/17/2017", "text": "The first time I ever found this place was a somewhat accidental brunch, and since then it's been my go-to. It's always had an eclectic vibe that just makes me feel at home.This past Saturday we deviated from the normal brunch and came for dinner (yes, while the town was deserted due to OU/TX). We started with the smoked salmon appetizer and loved it, although I would've enjoyed a few more crackers to make the wonderful experience last longer. As an entree I had the Pork Tenderloin Marsala with mashed sweet potatoes and grilled zucchini and it was fantastic, as was my date's Baked Chicken Parmesan. The Crème Brûlée certainly sounded appetizing but I was too full to eat any more by the end of my meal. It was charming to watch the restaurant slowly fill in the hour we were there, especially since a couple older crowds slowly filtered in either on a date night of their own or on a group outing. This is definitely one of my favorite places in Norman, and somewhat of a more hidden gem that doesn't seem to get as much attention."}, {"review_id": "aYKVhVKZGipnqWSKedakKQ", "user_id": "12XiJJ1ZhBvYpNfn3mjmoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Went here for Sunday Brunch. Very relaxing. Not rushed and the servers made us very comfortable. Great coffee and good drink options. Our group ordered the Grand Marnier French Toast, Veggie Pizza and BBQ Eggs Benedict.

The food is superb and something different from the rest of main street. Brunch or dinner on the weekends are awesome.

But man, it's good! Prices are reasonable for these meals (dinner looks more expensive). For brunch, I LOVE the Brunch Pizza. Have also tried the Brisket Benedict, which is top notch. At lunch, they have a cool lunch special where you can get an entree and a side for $9, or with two sides for $10. I can't even generalize to say that means \"sandwich and salad\", because they have so many unique options. Just try it already! :)"}, {"review_id": "jrD1NzBIMJvdey9Y8402Ug", "user_id": "E-NvsZXJiHJosCFNjsgKhQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/28/2017", "text": "Finally a place in Norman that knows how to make a proper Hollandaise sauce!!!
