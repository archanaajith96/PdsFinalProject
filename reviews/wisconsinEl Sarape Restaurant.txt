The food is terrific - my favorites are the enchiladas mole poblano, tostadas, and tamales. The burritos are also great, and don't overlook the chef's specialties menu section. The staff are always friendly and efficient, and everything is consistently good. I've been here dozens of times and I'm never disappointed.  Keep up the great work!"}, {"review_id": "t9B_jxUPN7LDMaTEA_ADiw", "user_id": "e3Fk7eLKAeRRysOdxmvCqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "This was the first time Ive been to this location. I wasn't thrilled with the welcome we received when we were seated and given menus. Hostesses don't typically throw menus on the table and walk away. That put a bad taste in my mouth, but our server tired it around and gave us good service thereafter.The menu is fairly extensive but all in all, it's the Mexican fare. I ordered chimichangas with shrimp (3 small) and I was actually pleasantly surprised with the size and quality of the shrimp! Usually it's kind of a gamble but I'm glad I ordered them. We don't typically order desert but there was a special on the fried ice cream, so we went for it. It was amazing!! It was the perfect end to a great meal. The guacamole is also a must! Very fresh and full of flavor!"}, {"review_id": "z_svDkpYRC8UrWrj-mkTdg", "user_id": "z5jcgKwdTqn09AruCml-Ag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "This is the best Mexican restaurant in Green Bay!

I called and spoke to the manager who said he was unable to remake the order or refund me I kept pushing and he finally told me the owner was coming in later and he would talk to them and call me back the same day the manager never ended up calling me back so I called him the following day and was told that he had a meeting with the owner and were not able to refund or remake our order but wanted us to try them again but they could not guarantee that the food would be good. I will never be back at this restaurant again!!! very upsetting"}, {"review_id": "TZGG0hHXZVW7NxDwdZDCFw", "user_id": "SBX_EaXDI6HG-AHoXtwVcw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "Great food yummy margaritas leaving FULL but not broke!!

The first time I was here our waiter was not very good. It took awhile for us to get water and my friend and I were looking around wondering what was going on. We decided to order our food right away because we were worried this would be our only chance. The food came out pretty quickly which was nice. It was all pretty overdone. I got a cheese quesadilla which is pretty hard to mess up but the cheese wasn't fully melted inside. The beans and rice were fine. My friend got the chicken enchiladas and said they were overdone but pretty good. The waiter gave us our food and we didn't see him again until he gave us our bill. We only had one glass of water with our meal so it was hard to finish it without the waiter coming over and offering us more to drink. I wouldn't count on getting great service here, unless you come for dinner, when there is a big rush. It seems as though I get better service here when things are crazy and all the staff is running around serving tables. Overall it's a cheap option and they serve ok food."}, {"review_id": "7sYuF3MoQHuvpmpCxylpBQ", "user_id": "aqRMDImK64kU0S-zbY83kA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "It was ok but nothing special food wise, service wasnt the greatest and the surprise we received on our bill appearently if you are a group of 5 or more they automatically add 15 percent tip, i guess thats why the service was a little ify they didnt have to work for that tip. Also found out if you're a group of 10 or more they only will do one check....

Every inch has a mural or carving- super bright and colorful. Love the chips and salsa that come with every meal. The horchata is good but very sweet. I usually water it down.I got the Burrito de Frijoles y Aguacate (bean and avocado burrito) Sarape style (smothered in a sauce of various heat levels and melted Swiss cheese). It was enormous! But I think I'll forego the Sarape style next time as it was swimming in sauce. I loved the beans with avocado in the burrito although I was a little wary at first but it ended up being a great texture.Overall, I enjoyed and would go again."}, {"review_id": "JqeN-K6hAqLs2DgaKJLdMA", "user_id": "sCOzbxDcE3rTt2uL8sAqFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/3/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is my favorite mexican restaurant in Green Bay! There food is authentic and always very, very tasty. I have been here over a dozen times and have never once been disappointed in the food or staff. The place is clean, well kept, and their is never a long wait for service. You will never leave feeling hungry. Also, their margaritas are fantastic! The best margs on the rocks I have ever had. Also, their chips and salsa are great! Chips are always warm and crispy fresh and salsa is flavorful. The only complainant I have is that their rice and beans are not very good (pretty bland and beans are soupy) and that should be a staple at any mexican joint. So I would suggest just skipping those. My favorite are the authentic style ribeye with guacamole tacos and three meats tacos."}, {"review_id": "SDbYtLRGqzhw6DKj9LDJmA", "user_id": "_c1dx5zPEiHFxnW6nVeATQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/19/2016", "text": "Loving the new location...
