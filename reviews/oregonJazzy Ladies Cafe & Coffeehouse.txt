We shared a bacon, waffle and eggs. That was the biggest mistake ever. I wish that I had my own. It was the BEST waffle EVER. Waffles are one of my favorites and I order them a lot...always searching the perfect waffle. I found it. PERFECT!The service was awesome and the coffee is good also. Its a tiny spot so you may have to wait for a bit, but it is worth it. I heard the other table talking about the delightful porchetta sandwich. Wouldn't mind trying that."}, {"review_id": "vsFPdDxJ_jSBoqZw9RYLXw", "user_id": "IpqmQWKqph-s4pB7S4V69w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "This is a lovely spot, but \"cozy\" doesn't even begin to describe how small this place is. It is a 10 top at best including the side bar.  If you have a large group order it to be picked up and bring it home.  That being said, the food is amazing.  My son had waffels and eggs which he hoovered up in complete silence and record time and wanted seconds.  I had the hash with a well done fried egg...to live for.  Hot coco and fresh coffee were also part of the experience.  This is a most delightful place to get breakfast/brunch.  The only draw back is the space."}, {"review_id": "SVCiN_5q0D3kUcq9UPlqCA", "user_id": "FMKJskqhnJZZnUAi3gVZXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Chicken and Waffles for Steven, Spicy Roasted Sweet Potato Hash for Me. The chef was amazing, she was on her lunch break when we came in and came up to us anyway when we looked like we had never been there before (we hadn't) and answered all of our questions, even my dumb one about what a Frittata is. My Hash was super great, I'm going to get two eggs over easy next time instead of one because the egg juice put it all together and he caramelized sriracha onions were great and not too spicy. The chicken and waffles were great too, I had never had them before but Steven enjoyed with a bit of Tabasco all over. Forgot to take pics of food here's our faces. Thank you! We will be back."}, {"review_id": "ipwZTlCKy9_uv3L07e8H5w", "user_id": "E4IOLwXOPXHDpDmjbpf8tQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "We ran over to Jazzy Ladies during an unexpected downpour while walking through the Saturday market which Jazzy Ladies is located right next too! Greeted by extremely friendly and welcoming service, and they took time to tell us about the local, fresh, and primarily gluten free ingredients used in their friend- some of which they run out and grab from the market! Jazzy ladies has a full bar, coffee & tea, and a pretty extensive brunch menu with lots of healthy and gluten free options. We started out with some cappuccinos (made with hemp milk), but then we were so intrigued by the menu we decided to try the chicken and waffles. Everything was wonderful! Plan to get cozy (small space) but it is charming and the food/ambiance is worth it!

The staff is super friendly, the moment we walked in the owner knew we had not been here before and told us about how all the food was homemade and even offered us food off the breakfast menu despite it being noon. Everyone else who came through the door was greeted by their first name and with a smile. The atmosphere is calm with lots of sunlight and soft jazz playing. The food was very flavorful but still managed to have a very homemade feel (almost as if my mother made it). I would most definitely come here again if I'm ever in town."}, {"review_id": "0Bc3BrN3h4uuWJlkGFz5vA", "user_id": "sJV68tEUU0YtntfNho4Yrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "Im not always excited about the food in Eugene. However this place took me by surprise. Everything was amazing , the food , culture, menu options...We went on a Saturday and although we sat down quickly the food had a long wait.

Today we decided to bare the traffic of downtown Eugene during Saturday market to experience the amazingness of Jazzy Ladies Cafe. We were greeted & seated in the tiny little cafe by one of the owners herself & explained the menu & operations of the restaurant. Quickly we decided there were too many delicious looking items for us not to share (which is rare for us as we all have drastically different tastes & dietary restrictions). We ordered the white mocha, iced mocha, hemp latte, iced latte, blackberry mimosa, porchetta hash, berry waffle, asparagus mushroom frittata, Elvis waffle (no bacon), and last but definitely not least, the cinnamon role! First off, that was the best dang cinnamon role I have ever had in my life. Nothing has ever compared. You could taste the real butter they used in the dough and the melted, oozy butter on top was to die from. Secondly, those waffles...I could eat those every day for the rest of my life. While being both vegan & gluten free, these waffles were able to please our entire group (a rarity in our group). They were perfectly crispy on the outside & fluffy on the inside. The hash was absolutely AMAZING! One friend commented that it was a bit greasy, but if you like southern/soul food cooking (my mama's from Virginia so a little grease never scared) me), you would LOVE this hash! So yummy. So delicious. And served in a cast iron pan! Our frittata also came served in a cast iron but seemed a bit dry. Hard to judge when this is something I've had difficult with regarding frittatas myself, but once we piled the hash on top of the frittata, we were a happy group of ladies! My only disappointment was with the mimosa. The blackberry and champagne really did not compliment each other and it basically tasted like cheap champagne with a spoon full of defrosted blackberry thrown in. I would try the other flavors, but the blackberry will definitely never be ordered again by me & my friends. Overall, our coffee, food, & most importantly, the cinnamon role, were delicious & my girlfriends & myself cannot wait to return!"}, {"review_id": "xyIsVPQM8djHrzywmeY12A", "user_id": "o1a-c5aQvaM_I2GvXp8YzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Woww!! My husband and I were stopping in Eugene for a concert the night before and decided to try this place out as we're always on the lookout for GLUTEN-FREE and EGG-FREE options because I have weird dietary needs.We both ordered two different hashes - I got a sweet potato hash with tomatoes and spinach - the tomatoes were so juicy, sweet and flavorful and paired with the sausage was great. Healthier than typical greasy breakfast food by far.My husband got the Irish Hash - I love how the Corned Beef in the Irish Hash was in big cubes (and it wasn't typical greasy diner food corned beef...this was sophisticated!). They make all of their meats and sausages in house which was a huge plus! Plus, their house hot-sauce was excellent on top of the hash. The space is very tight knit and small (probably seating for 20 people at most, small cozy 2 person tables and stools against the window bar...so be prepared to get comfy close with a stranger!Oh and their gluten-free cinnamon roll.....DIVINE! Ask them to warm it up for you...it is heavenly."}, {"review_id": "vsBPwR1Y9q_DcpPaP5aI3Q", "user_id": "IF1T41EABb7qQKsZGHR5hw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "My husband recently learned that he has celiac disease, and not only has to avoid gluten, but soy even moreso. He has lost a lot of weight because of having to avoid so many things, and realizing that many gluten-free ingredients in the stores are replaced by soy products. We are now happy CSA members, but Jazzy Ladies Cafe is the only place we have come across which is free of soy as well as gluten. Traveling to Portland has also put us on some earnest searches, and only the Cultured Caveman is a reasonable option in a world of uncertain allergenic gluten replacements there...I hope that more restaurants model themselves after Jazzy Ladies (who I hope are able to expand their seating :)). They are delicious, creative, ask dietary questions, have great pride in their offerings and service. Carmen and Michelle make sure to introduce themselves to new patrons, and ensure that you are having the best experience."}, {"review_id": "CVnuHaUOKZkeXoZlN2h-rA", "user_id": "QjlvCh91DMm4HA2I1DjxsQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Fantastic breakfasts!
