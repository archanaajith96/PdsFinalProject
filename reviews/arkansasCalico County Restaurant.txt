Absolutely delicious!  Great home cooking!  I had the vegetable plate with Mac and cheese, fried okra, pinto beans and sweet potato casserole topped off with a yeast roll.  All of it was fresh and tasty just like grandma made!!  The service was also terrific and the building itself was very well furnished with old timey treasures on the walls.  The restaurant is not on a main road so Yelp definitely brought us to this place. You wouldn't just happen upon it without knowing where you were going.  If you are in the mood for good country food, definitely try this place!  You won't be disappointed!!"}, {"review_id": "YrqkPcR7E711PZqpQWW66g", "user_id": "3xAX4QH6yvTvrm5z-3QYUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "I have had some disappointing food experiences as of late, and Calico County Restaurant was JUST the cure to end my streak of gloomy happenstances. You are greeted with charm, you are sat promptly in a cozy comfy seat, and given time to browse over their menu while your drinks are served up. First off, can I just say that I love the simplicity of their menu. Plenty of choices, but not so many that the decision is an arduous process full of anxiety and foreboding. I chose the chicken fried steak (lite portion) and hubby got the hamburger steak...I will never understand his affinity for hamburger steak. An appetizer of Fried Green Tomatoes, and our selections were off for preparation whilst we were left to enjoy some simply delicious VERY homemade-like cinnamon rolls. Then comes my petite salad. Oh my land, the crotons alone were enough to give you plenty to read about, super flavorful, light, and crispy. Good crisp fresh salad...plain good. In the middle of my salad arrived the tomatoes. A good cornmeal batter, and overall, just a delicious introduction to remoulade sauce for us. We added a touch of pepper to the tomatoes and that made them about perfect. Shortly after we split the last tomato, our food arrived. At this point, I can't tell you how thankful I am that I selected the lite eater portion. The mashed potatoes are real, red skinned, lumpy, and delicious. I added a touch of salt and everything was perfect. I tried his hamburger steak, and it was also good, fries were excellent. Rolls were deliciously dense. EVERYTHING tasted like it was real, homemade, not from a can, fresh from market, food. Now...as a side option you can choose to get cobbler. Do it, and do it in peach. This was heavenly y'all. I am so sad we went here, as we are 275 miles away from this dish alone. Much too far for a casual drop in. Hats off to Brandi for her excellent service and oh another plus...You HAVE to respect a business that closes early for Super Bowl. Thank you for turning around my bad streak of miserable eating experiences, and oh what a turnaround."}, {"review_id": "MH2_EDbnn7ARxjf8pAloYg", "user_id": "TMz9ZS1C8yc3TfZ1VamJoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Great homecooked food, better than any other breakfast place I've been to in Ft.

Everything, from the amazingly hand-battered mozzarella sticks, to the sweetly savory and wonderfully fluffy hush puppies, to the best fried catfish I've ever had, to the somehow exceptional baked potato, to the hard-to-believe-they're-complimentary stellar cinnamon rolls, to the dad-gummed ice water with lemon, every single bite brought ever-ascending levels of joy and satisfaction. Cracker Barrel's little sister will shamelessly steal all of Big Sister's suitors if she ever dares introduce them to this little firecracker. Seriously, if you're thinking of visiting that road-tripping favorite of finger-lickin' home-cookin', stop right now and put this place in your GPS instead (cuz you probably won't find it without a little help from google maps). This place is AWWWWWWESOME.And ask for Brandi. She's without a doubt one of my favorite waitresses in months."}, {"review_id": "jCMTrNZiHes5Is-CIXdb-w", "user_id": "oyLHgxXNcZ5oSeqhECtidA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Service was incredibly slow and the restaurant was not busy.

The cinnamon roll was good, not dried out or hard. I got the chicken fried steak, okra and mashed. All came out hot and fresh from the oven. The gravy was awesome and the seasoning on the chicken fried steak was great. The only down was the potatoes were a bit salty, almost too salty. But they were not out of the box, had those awesome pieces of skin mixed in and they gravy tempered the salt back. I ate every bit. I went during lunch and my server was a bit hectic, but it was busy and she was very attentive. Next time I am in town I will definitely go back"}, {"review_id": "Jwed202CbpupRyCPcSg7FQ", "user_id": "djykEjDKPDpyvaEwMRoHRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I no longer live in Fort Smith but we make it a point to eat here when we are in town.  The best breakfast!  Love the cinnamon rolls and chocolate gravy."}, {"review_id": "H94Pm-yTSg5gSGQRgQZncg", "user_id": "NjL2mzUEW0XWXmdwIZspeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Great homemade food and ample portions.  Our family has been eating here for years!  Love the complimentary cinnamon rolls and the hometown atmosphere.  One of Fort Smith's culinary institutions!

Fantastic. Chicken & dumplings, chicken strips, smothered rice were all very good, well seasoned. The meatloaf was like a huge brick of delicious beef. The corn could've used a bit more seasoning but that's literally the only thing we could find wrong with anything. Bonus points for the cinnamon rolls! You know how other restaurants bring you baskets of bread or breadsticks before the main course? Here it's cinnamon rolls. They're warm, with the texture of an excellent dinner roll, and full of cinnamon. No frosting, which was perfect to me, because it means they're slightly sweet but not overwhelmingly so."}, {"review_id": "r8yZkTwQX3sY2CyGKjLKQw", "user_id": "gpGouIbW5GLmE05EBEr1sA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Went for my first time and was disappointed considering all the great reviews. Ordered scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and onion and hash browns with the same. I don't know if they were having an off day or what but the service was very slow, to the point I was just about ready to get up and leave when someone finally showed up. Placed my order and instead of cheddar cheese on my eggs and hash browns they put American cheese and my eggs were over cooked to the point most of them were crisp. I honestly have no interest in trying again but it appears they have enough of a fan base my business will not be missed."}, {"review_id": "35CWVJP_UUu842SB9XAECQ", "user_id": "qDCdxKC2gsEkNXcndwPfWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/23/2017", "text": "This was an absolute gem! We drove from Georgia to Oklahoma for a wedding and stopped for the night in Fort Smith. Since I'm not a fan of hotel breakfasts, we always make a point to find a local spot to dine before getting back on the road. From the exterior this place doesn't look like much, but step inside and the ambience sweeps you into this old school diner feel. The dining room is huge and even has a separate room for larger parties. Our waitress took our drink order and came back with our beverages and put down the basket of cinnamon rolls. What a treat! The coffee was hot and delicious and the food was cooked perfectly. It almost made me sad to leave Fort Smith because this was truly one of the best breakfast experiences I've ever had!

You have to love a restaurant that lists pot roast potatoes and pot roast carrots as sides. I understand this place has been putting home cooking out since 1984 and I can understand why. When we sat down we were given a basket with two unglazed cinnamon rolls. Our waitress was a delight. Very quick with everything with a great attitude. We had the onion rings as an appetizer and they were terrific. I had the chicken fried steak and it had been coated in pretty much the same batter as the rings. Crisp and peppery. The potatoes and carrots tasted just like they came out of the roast pan and my companion loved her grilled chicken and sides and the cornbread was outstanding. Those cinnamon rolls were just a little bit of perfect. The bread was just the right consistency and the sugar to cinnamon ratio was perfect. This place was fun and the food was great.

Server Percy was friendly and helpful with the menu.  Drinks came out quick and the free cinnamon rolls are on the table.  Brewed tea tasted great. Ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. The tomatoes were hot and crispy and served with Ranch and a remoulade sauce.  They came out fast, the order of 5 is plenty for 2 people. As for the entrees we ordered the chicken fried steak special with the squash casserole as suggest by Percy and the mash potatoes.  The food again came out hot and fast.  The portion size (lunch for the special) was more than plenty of food. The chicken fried stake was good, the mashed potatoes were real, and the squash casserole was as good as Percy said.  The dinner roll was amazing yeast roll and real butter on the table.My friend had the fried catfish, mashed potatoes, and green beans.  The catfish was light and fresh tasting perfectly seasoned.  But her favorite was the green beans she said they were delicious. She had the cornbread and said it was good.  The hush puppies were also excellent. Then the finale was the terrific cinnamon rolls, no dessert necessary after this wonderful treat.Other Yelp reviews were spot on this place was great when you are looking for yummy southern comfort food."}, {"review_id": "QVhOwAT0flntppJBSa6gBg", "user_id": "KB5dkMWpCzPYk375rMloWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/5/2017", "text": "Great food and hospitality. Plus the staff were wearing shirts in memory of fallen soldiers for memorial day, they get bonus points for that alone. The food was delicious. True southern style. Probably not a place for the health conscious. We ordered the fried green tomatoes (awesome), my gf got the chicken fried steak (lunch portion which was perfect size) and I go the small order of deep fried ribs. The deep fried ribs were pretty delicious. I have never had anything like that before and my heart probably can't handle it everyday either.Did I also mention that there pre-dinner rolls are cinnamon rolls? I would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking for a place to eat, especially after camping/floating all weekend."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/calico-county-restaurant-fort-smith?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
