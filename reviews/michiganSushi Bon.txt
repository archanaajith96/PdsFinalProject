Most the sushi items are cooked and catered to less authentic and risk averse palates here. I came to this place when it first opened, and they had kitchen offerings such as bulgogi and other Korean staples, but now it's sushi only. When I was looking at the menu, so many ingredients are recycled and rearranged among the rolls, I didn't really know if I was ordering anything different. I ordered a few rolls and while it was good, it pales in comparison to authentic places like Ajishin and One World."}, {"review_id": "udhvVzY_UihnWeNC_L1RAA", "user_id": "3uUq0USFS2O3dSt5dSEjpQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Driving in the parking lot was horrible and the sign looked cheap... (the building may have been under reconstruction)A bit nervous for quality food, my mood changed instantly once I walked inside. The staff was very friendly and the sushi smelled fresh and delicious. The atmosphere was modern and dim and I enjoyed the subtle feel. Edamame and miso soup came with our sushi combo, and I enjoyed both very much! The Edamame had a salt like coating on the peels which gave great flavor to the beans, and the miso also had great flavor-but lacked any amount of tofu: possibly it wasn't meant to have any, but I liked it anyways.Next came our sushi-which even came with fried rice.... YES.The execution for the plating was great and it made me even more anxious to dig in. The sushi was indeed fresh and tasty like it smelled in the beginning and I was impressed. We had multiple kinds (I believe the choice \"A\" for the combination platter) and they were all yummy: I especially liked the \"Sushi Bon\" sushi roll. After we feasted on all of the delicious sushi, we moved on to green tea Mochi. It was my first time having this Japanese desert, and I would definitely love to have it again. Overall, the prices were fair to the portions and the quality was excellent. I will definitely be returning!"}, {"review_id": "CWAW-JnUADNep5g5I-cCMA", "user_id": "HQFLuTSXZ4-qx-VbT7Kbew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Sushi Bon is becoming a staple for my significant other and me. I have yet to find all that many good restaurants in Warren... but Sushi Bon is an exception. Solid sushi and sake. It's also never too crowded here, so no problem getting a table. The service has always been great and kind. Prices were pretty standard for sushi. Not super cheap, but not nearly as expensive as some of the Royal Oak places. I would say better quality than those other places too!TRY THE YUM YUM ROLL. It is divine."}, {"review_id": "Sl0agy9oadpV7siJfclRIQ", "user_id": "PKl4NOIQDEfF8VfspIn5vA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "I've been trying to find a great sushi place in Warren forever! I'm super happy with Sushi Bon. The prices are good and the sushi roll choices are impressive. I've tried the Red Dragon (spicy!) and a few other basics, but so far my favorite is the signature Sushi Bon roll. The staff is friendly but I've only done carry-out so far.

The outside doesn't give it justice. But inside everyone was friendly, the service was so fast I could not believe it. I had my order in 3 minutes. And there were 3 other tables of people. Nothing about my first trip was anything other than amazing. I don't write 5 star detailed reviews often but this place deserves it and then some. Just wow. I got miso soup, edamame, spicy tuna roll and a philly roll. Miso was on point. Edamame was slightly under salted for my taste but that's better for me anyway, I tend to like lightly salted. Spicy tuna roll was amazing, perfect portions and spice. Philly roll was less smoky than I like but just amazing. Can't recommend this place enough."}, {"review_id": "d45X25KHKBwpi9rCo1L0Mw", "user_id": "Qe91SsQ08t4JUlnlToDosA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/17/2017", "text": "I've only been here before an after rushes, so I am speaking mostly of the sushi and service itself.As someone who is new to sushi and is an infamous picky eater, this is a great sushi place to start your adventure.

I can come in here to stuff my face, get some work done or have a romantic meal. The seating accommodations are comfortable and the decor matches.
