Yesterday we hiked at Arches National Park, and today we had lunch at Even Stevens. I would say each is top of class. We were totally satisfied by each experience, and would not change anything about either experience Even Stevens served us up a couple of the best sandwiches we've ever had. They are an independent little sandwich shop, which also gives back to the community. The staff was exceptionally friendly, and it appears their hearts are into serving up delicious home cooked food and to creating an overall pleasant and relaxed experience. If you like home grown eateries be sure to stop by for a delectable sandwich at Even Stevens!"}, {"review_id": "28v-GlsXyWQtEMO8f6YFAg", "user_id": "yU6NK_18CmCtHB7OetPkoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Even  Stevens is a local sandwich shop and it is delicious! They  have gluten free and vegan options as well for anyone  that has picky food choices or severe allergies.Every sandwich they sell to someone, they end up donating another one to a child who's sick or starving.

Here's the review:Even Stevens isn't a place you come to if you are working with a time constraint. The service was slow. It took about 40 minutes to order and get my food. I ordered the pot roast dip and the Mac and cheese. The sandwich tasted fantastic! I would highly recommend it to anyone who goes. The Jalapeño jelly created a sweet balance to the savory meat and dip. The Mac and cheese was ok. Nothing extraordinary, a bit too runny for my liking.My friend ordered the party tots. Definitely not worth it. We hardly touched them.If you come here, stick with the sandwiches"}, {"review_id": "9Gfa9O1jmj5HU7D2tX0tUg", "user_id": "gLoUGzw_3h7ECKRINTHtRQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Had lunch here today for the first time.

The manager stole my wallet. His name is ANDREW CATALDO. I literally saw him shove it in his pocket when I tried to relocate it, then when I approached to confront the facts; he denied everything, and all the other employees covered it up for him as well. I couldn't believe it. Ive already initiated a case with an attorney and the GM.

I have never had a sandwich from here that I didn't like. My favorite is the Sprang Chicken. One of my favorites is to do the Do Gouda on a baguette. Really you can pick any of the sandwiches from here and be happy. Their breakfast is as equally good. The breakfast burrito is a favorite of mine."}, {"review_id": "R5ugUE0aixKpHoa3pEAXnA", "user_id": "JNoFOtqjrgF0ZJCN6qKeLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Every time I'm in Salt Lake City, this is one of my go-to spots. Great place to get a sandwich for lunch or breakfast burrito. I've had the pork belly bahn mi and mahimahi bahn mi. Both sandwiches are really good. I've also had the grad breakfast burrito and that is really tasy as well. Other than the food, I'm also a huge fan of their charitable efforts. For every sandwich they sell, they (in turn) donate a sandwich to one of their nonprofit organizations. Really awesome of them. Being, that this place is down the street from the University of Utah, they also offer free wifi and coffee to students. All you have to do is show your student ID."}, {"review_id": "146yvlO95qEDzpihW8KkvQ", "user_id": "aF5CQWPLp1_pWWaQ6yzrzQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/18/2017", "text": "This places didn't blow my mind but it was good enough. My children got the kids Mac and cheese.  Not the best. The kids grilled cheese is a joke too. Had to send it back.  Why can't kids menu items be good anywhere?  They sometimes deserve good quality food too!!!Anyway, I got the stuffed French toast. Meh. Too soggy for me. I didn't care for the taste of it. My husband got a steak sandwich and really liked it a lot. 3 stars for great service and fine food. Nothing incredible, but glad I tried it. I'd definitely go back and give this place another shot."}, {"review_id": "HOQf4JTrn_phPrdSmMk-Bg", "user_id": "dCRXIHYwLbLbHwCdZOQMbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/3/2017", "text": "I like the idea behind this place, and I like the food. So it's a win win. It's quickly become a hot spot because of their quick service, and hip atmosphere. People love to go to a place that's local and feels local, and it only adds to the allure when they involve charity donation.Artwork is all done by Trent Call. Who is a staple of the city. Everyone who knows local artists and even those who don't know any local artists at all will recognize his work.They offer vegan options, and serve alcohol. They have brunch on Sunday's with all you can eat French toast and bottomless mimosas. The sandwiches are terrific, and the salads are great too. You can tell they use quality ingredients too and not just crappy deli meat."}, {"review_id": "BVnbxWbRKnwhkgXbc_igpQ", "user_id": "BvOaUqS_oKJMR5KWTKhe5w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "It's official, Even Stevens and I have broken up. I started coming here when they very first opened and the place was awesome... great food, happy service, prompt and efficient, loved their philanthropic mission. I was hooked and was a repeat customer ever since. But, over time, as they've got more popular, the wait time has got longer and longer. I've been in at weekends with my family and waited 45 minutes, I've been in on week days solo, 15/20 minutes for a single sandwich is common.  Usually I'm happy to wait but yesterday was the final straw...called through my single sandwich order in advance, told it would be 10 minutes, turn up, wait....10 turns into 15, 15 turns into 20, 20 approaches 25 and the counter staff seem to have no real clue as to where my order was in the queue. I guess I got stuck behind a large order but there were a lot of busy people working hard behind the counter so I was surprised they couldn't turn their orders more quickly, especially on a lunch time  when people have to get back to work. I took a refund and left, rushed back to the office, late for work and starving, with no lunch in sight. The food was and still is delicious, don't get me wrong. I love that everything is freshly made. I'm gutted that I can't go there so much now.  There always seems to be plenty of staff and the menu doesn't alter too much so I don't understand how the long waits happen. Still, I'm heartbroken but we lasted longer than most Kardashian marriages..."}, {"review_id": "XmF-fntos4Sz92WPVyWcaA", "user_id": "ZUM00YHJpg4VMdcuV8KhWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "One of the best sandwich shops around.

The service at all of the locations I've been to is consistently excellent. My favorite sandwich is the \"capreezy\", even though it is a bit on the oily side due to the pesto.
