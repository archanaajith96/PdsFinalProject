Afterwards, go have a drink at the fountain bar in the Peabody across the street.Cons: Compared to several local favorites for barbecue, the Rendezvous is just not as good. Over the years, they have began to rely on their name. Portion sizes have shrunk on some of the dishes..As a local, I only go here once in a blue moon. It is always fun and I am seldom disappointed. If you're looking for a good time and a great atmosphere, this is the place to go.

Lesson learned.  We will NEVER come back. Smh. Then on top of that no desert menu and had to pay $10 to park.Food was horrible. I think they put BBQ sauce in the slaw. Pork sandwich was cold. Smh. I just can't say anything good at all about this establishment. Not for the true African American BBQ lover at all. It was a weird atmosphere. It was like all the people working there were from the 60's....felt like the movie....GET OUT on the inside!!"}, {"review_id": "60FXjifYI5DETzyI2YWmyA", "user_id": "De8koO26NgVx9GkII-bgwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Good enough for Justin Timberlake, good enough for me!Not only JT, but lots of other celebs are huge fans of Charlie Vergos Rendezvous. You can see many autographed photos adorning the basement walls of this historic joint; I spotted Peyton and Eli Manning for one. This BBQ restaurant has been serving 'cue since 1948, wow. You'll be able to inhale the charcoal smoke well before you even get to the restaurant. We came for a lunch one Saturday, and I was relieved since there was no wait. Our table split an order of barbecue pork nachos ($11.50) that hit the spot, and we were treated to complimentary portions of the beans and rice. We were expecting shot glass size samples, but they were legit portions. Ribs are what you do here. Two of us shared a pork ribs and brisket combination ($22.00). The dry rub they use is a magical unicorn. It's a mix of Greek seasonings, Cajun spices, and paprika, and a vinegar wash is involved. We subsequently tried ribs at another Memphis BBQ establishment, and the rub there wasn't as phenomenal. We all agreed it was the best here. The brisket was totally respectable also.Someone else at our table ordered a half chicken ($17) for everyone to try, and it seemed pretty good though I was less focused on that than the ribs. There were no side choices, only beans and slaw. That turned out to be fine with me since they both were tasty, and I didn't have to struggle to decide which sides to get. Looking at the website, some of the servers have been with Rendezvous for decades which is pretty mind-boggling in this day and age. Just a heads up, Rendezvous is closed Sunday and Monday. Super glad my friend recommended this place and that it was close by!"}, {"review_id": "7PKrVOIFwGa_88XH1efvKQ", "user_id": "NhTWPDnDy0UomxeFpqcNBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Absolutely delish.

The staff is season and soulfully passionate about the brand, with many having worked there for decades as original staff or working to retirement. They know the menu like the back of their hand - so trust their recommendations!They specialize in dry rub, but have several house sauces to compliment your ribs depending on your flavor preference. The mustard cole slaw is different/surprising, but delicious. The baked beans are slightly spicy. The rib meat is \"fall off the bone\" good.

Tucked in a back alley and down some stairs, you'll find a den of diners feasting on some smoked meats.Luckily it was pretty early and they have a separate system if you want to order to-go. I got an order of a half slab of ribs (per usual), which came with bread and some BBQ sauce on the side. The ribs are a dry rub and the flavoring was phenomenal.I drove with BBQ in my back seat for a few hours before getting to eat it, but the meat was easy to pull off the bones (I didn't need a knife to separate the ribs from each other). If I had to compare to Central BBQ, I'd have to agree with locals in that Rendezvous has much better flavoring in the rub and texture of the meat turned out better as well (even after a few hours). The BBQ sauce also was pretty good. I could eat some ribs with and without it. A half slab was about 7 ribs and amazingly I finished all of them.Rendezvous has my vote as best BBQ in Memphis."}, {"review_id": "REeq1UXC-a9SOw3pkeeYFQ", "user_id": "mMV6IQNCcjmeD3y4INUgNg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "While attending a conference in Memphis I was directed to what I was told was the best BBQ in the world! Now that is a bold statement as someone who travels a lot and has eaten a lot of amazing food across the world. So unfortunately the bar was set very high before I even got here. If you are a tourist finding this place can be tricky and scary walking down the back alley to find the entrance. Walking downtown I ran into more then a handful of unique characters who I would not want to run into in a dark alley.The restaurant was packed and they can handle it! They had an upstairs and downstairs with every table full. This is a very popular place to be! The tables made me feel like I was at a picnic in the park which is great for a bbq environment when your ready to roll up your sleeves and dive face first into a rack of ribs. I ordered a rack and a few sides and they were quickly delivered to the table. I do my fair share of smoking of meat so I could tell that they put a great deal of effort into preparing the ribs. He flavor was good but a little over whelming with the seasoning. The dry rub was so thickly applied I couldn't taste the actual meat as I chewed. I do love flavor but I still want to taste the meat in my ribs when I eat. Overall the food was good and if your in town it's something to experience, but don't go in thinking it's the best in the world!"}, {"review_id": "9IvxpHgfpxfUoqvupLa7Dg", "user_id": "GxYApwT4fvWU0TN1He3LTw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "So almost everyone we spoke suggested this place and it has pretty good reviews. My review... it was ok. Wasn't the best bbq I've had but wasn't the worse. Maybe I'm not use to Memphis BBQ. Who knows. But.. the place is huge with lots of seating in several different rooms. The actual entrance of the main doors is in an alley so remember that when you're trying to find the place. I ordered the ribs and brisket and the brisket was great!! Yum yum! The dry rub ribs were ok. I wish they were more moist and not so dry and it wasn't hard to bite them off the bone. The potato salad had a little bit of a bite to it due to the spice and I really enjoyed the difference in that. Coleslaw also was spicy and while some seem to like that, I was just hoping for a plain coleslaw. We also got the nachos with pork and those were great! They came out super quick and our server was friendly and funny.  The ribs an the brisket is a lot of food so you'll probably have a little left overs.

Came with Cole slaw that tasted like Apple cider vinegar. The bbq sauce I can't even describe the taste, it just wasn't good. I wanted to go in to try something small before having some ribs and other items but I couldn't do that to my taste buds. I hope they don't use the same bbq sauce on the other meat as they do the sandwhich. Anywho, I'm just a tourist from Texas.

When I think of good bbq ribs, the meat falls of the bone and easy to chew on. My husband said his wasn't dry or tough. Maybe I just got a bad batch tonight.

The entrance is in an alley, but that's where the semi-seediness ends. As soon as you step food inside, and make your way down the stairs, you feel like you're entering a Memphis foundational establishment. This place has some history and the ambiance carries that air about it.The tables are covered and outfitted with cheap table cloths and utensils but the wait staff is dressed well and they mean business. We started with a round of drinks and then moved on to ordering our main meal (as we were all pretty hungry). The menu is very self-explanatory and easy to follow but our waiter also was not at all opposed to answering the few questions we did have. Everyone had a little something different but all agreed it was tasty. Personally, I had a full rack of dry-rub ribs and they were very enjoyable. And huge - a good-sized portion! Since there was so many other options on the table I also was able to sample a few other items and didn't come across anything I didn't like.On top of the service level of the staff, the delicious food, and the history of this place, they play GREAT music! I nearly had to be restrained from getting up and dancing a few times because their juke box is ON POINT! It really was a four-fecta of a meal.This spot was recommended to us by an Uber driver as the answer to our question of, \"What's the BEST BBQ in Memphis?\" I don't know if he was right, because this was the only BBQ we had, but it sure was tasty! If you're looking for a solid meal in a solid place, check it out.

Sat down, ordered the pork ribs and brisket combo. Came with coleslaw and beans. I liked the beans, the coleslaw was too \"vinegar-y\". They gave you bread, but it was soaked and soggy with vinegar sauce. Which kinda ruined it for me.But the main course: pork ribs. The rub was a but salty but when you added the BBQ sauce it was fricken awesome. The meat was so tender and juicy. The rub mixed with sauce added this strange but yet amazing mixture that danced nicely on your taste buds. Dance! Dance! The brisket. Good grace.
