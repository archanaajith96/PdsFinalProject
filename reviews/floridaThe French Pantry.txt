Everything here is baked and crafted to perfection. Everyone loves the sandwiches here and the fries are amazing as well. I always come here for the dessert case. I ABSOLUTELY love desserts and the cheesecake here is to die for.The location is odd and hard to find but it is so worth it. Although the lines may be long, I definitely recommend dining in to get the full experience. You will most likely have to share your table but the appetizer bread with olive oil that they give is divine. And you've got to lay eyes on the dessert case because it changes daily. The hours are unfortunate for this place but hey, good things usually don't come easy. If you can't dine in, you can also call early in the morning and see if they're taking pick up orders that day."}, {"review_id": "HPm2-sH02si_-k9lA0WcYQ", "user_id": "syc0AhTzma0s1EMKQ9V8mQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "CONS: The location is very strange and out of the way.

I always have leftovers which is the best Â for the next day. Their dessert if phenomenal but you def got to share it with someone or more.

I love the community table style that this place has adopted. It's very unique but also very efficient. Have many people to feed? Make them sit next to each other!! Although, I've imagined myself scarfing down the bread that they serve as an amuse bouche there, and I don't think that it's the prettiest sight. I always try to show off my best table manners when I'm eating here especially since the likelihood of sitting with strangers is very high and the last thing you need is someone judging you for stuffing your face with bread - guilty. I always get the bruschetta with chicken and pesto, and I always feel like I need to carted off and out of this place whenever I've eaten there because the portions are big and I may lack self control when it comes to bread, but that's besides the point. The staff is very friendly and the line does go by pretty quickly. The place is also very clean and kind of reminds me of a very homey type place even though you there are foam tile ceilings. I always look forward to having lunch here.

Yes, the hype is real. I had the turkey and goat cheese sandwich and my friend & I shared a piece of wedding cake. It was a vanilla cake w/ cream cheese icing and strawberry layers. MMM! It was delicious. They also give you a plate of homemade bread with dipping oil. Try not to fill up on this! We came later in the day about an hour before they closed (close at 215pm) and there was no line but as soon as we were seated, it filled up again! Hours are strange but make it happen!!!

I was a straight up noob entering The French Pantry. Obviously I failed to do my due diligence as a yelper and read all the pertinent reviews prior to my dining experience. I could not locate the menu, which happened to be on the wall to my immediate left. I fault the tantalizing cakes on display for obstructing my peripheral vision. So the way it works in case you're a first-timer like me is, you enter the front doors, assess your lunch selection based on the menu located on the wall to your left, inform the cashier of your selection, pay, and seat yourself afterwards. My studly lunch date told me the bruschettas are the most popular menu items. For that reason, even though I was eyeing the roast beef sandwich, I decided on the chicken and artichoke for my inaugural visit to The French Pantry. The bruschettas is served on a generous bed of greens with balsamic vinaigrette and the bread is A-M-A-ZINGGG. All of this deliciousness for $12?! Get out of here! While you're here, you should go ahead and treat yourself to a slice of cake. We got the wedding cake (recommended) and the German Chocolate Cake. The wedding cake has cream cheese icing, so hell yea.

I heard very good things about this restaurant and have been itching to dine here. Luckily, I was in the area for work and was able to make it in before they closed. There was no line and I got my order taken and was seated within 5 minutes. Now I just want to warn all my fellow introverts out there that the seating here is assigned to fill every possible seat there is. This means that if you have a smaller group, be prepared to be seated at a larger table with strangers. Yes, I know that's not ideal and not what most people are used to. And yes, I'll admit I did have some anxiety because I was solo-dining yet again, but I ended up totally enjoying my lunch and striking up a conversation with another solo diner. Yay for little bursts of extrovertedness. Anyway, on to the food! I ended up ordering one of their bruschetta dishes, as I was told these were one of the more popular items. They have a menu at the front of the store with all their daily specials and another menu inside for all of their staple dishes. I ended up ordering their spinach, onion, applewood smoked bacon, fontina cheese, and truffle oil bruschetta. Wow. I mean WOW. This was one of the most delicious bruschettas I've had. It was rich, filling, delicious, and satisfying. I'm glad they served it with a nice healing salad to help curb the guilt I started to feel. But after finishing the dish, I felt that all the guilt I was feeling was totally worth it. I finished off my meal with a cappuccino to fight my post-meal sleepiness. They sprinkled cinnamon on top, which gave the cup a homey feel. I was too full to order any desserts, but after taking a peek at their pastry lineup, I'll definitely be back to sample their sweets."}, {"review_id": "qKYtjvGwamiMfTunjZ1Cmw", "user_id": "F6mZJ6Z-p09FZVxVXQ0Vyw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "This place was extremely popular when hubby and I went to check it out.

We ordered the Napoleon and wedding cakes for dessert and a popular tomatoes chicken dish for our entrees. I honestly didn't care for the main entrees at all because the food was a but salty and extremely pricey. The cakes we're very delicious and refreshing but definitely not worth the wait or price.Also, the servers were not attentive because they are so busy.

(That's good)Once you're done ordering, the woman at the counter tells you which communal table to sit at. When I got to my table, there was already fresh bread and oil with balsamic vinegar and herbs. Let me just tell you.... and I know others have said this too... omg that bread. Â absolutely mouthwatering. I got the shrimp, artichoke, goat cheese bruschetta (probably their most popular one) and it was FANTASTIC!! In the middle was this gorgeous mixed greens and tomato salad and it was all perfect. Hubs got a bang bang shrimp poboy and he said it was good. You won't get much out of him word-wise but he ate everything and then some of mine. We also grabbed a wedding cake to go. I haven't grabbed a bite yet but I will... once my tummy goes back down! They also had this amazing looking crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e that the woman at the counter says isn't always made so when you see it get it. The hubs wouldn't let me go overboard but it looked sooooo good. I will say, it's a little pricey.

It's been a while and hopefully no line. We guessed right, no line. Upon going in there is a large menu to look at. I also noticed the dining area looks bigger and newly designed. You do sit with other people and can choose to engage or not. Everyone was so nice. The woman behind the counter will explain anything on the menu. Questions you may have or ways to change to fit your dietary needs. Hubs ordered the Kobi burger with fries. It looked so good I took a bite. It was a great looking and tasting burger. The meat, cheese, and what ever else they put in it went well together. Thick too. I, on the other hand, got the Eggplant bruschetta. The flavor of the eggplant, goat cheese, and balsamic dressing on the bread was spot on. I can see why this dish is popular. Besides the 4 baguettes slices with goat cheese and eggplant you also get a bed of field greens and a pile of tomatoes. Everything together was delicious. The dish alone could be for 2 people. So I ate half and saved the rest. Then the Napolean. It brought back memories of having Napolean ice cream. This is the first one that I've ever had with real strawberries and strawberry purÃ©e. The crunch, the flavors, everything was eye rolling good. This place has always been great. Still is, it's a must try.

It's an inconvenient location, kept odd hours, wasn't open on the weekends, and the line was always out the door, down the sidewalk and into the parking lot. Ain't nobody got time for that!But listen, the legend is true. I managed to get here on Saturday before 2:15. I was 4th in line, the cashier was super nice and helpful, and let me just say, \"Worth it\". I quickly kicked my keto diet to the curb when I saw their bread, the pastries and OMG, the dessert. I had the seared ahi tuna with rice noodles and my picky AF child had the French Dip sandwich. As a teenager, he is forbidden to show exuberance over anything but if his eyes rolling to the back of his head is any indication, then that sandwich was goooooooood. Seating is limited so we did take out which gave me ample opportunity to stare at all the food being served to the diners as we waited. All of it looked delicious, fresh and plentiful. If you're on a diet or trying to be on one, this is not the place to be. I shall not rest until I've tried at least 75% of the menu.

The reason I avoided it was because of the wait times I've heard about, in addition to the price point and what I had heard about it being \"Fancy\" Well, I'm here to report the obvious, believe half of what you see- and none of what you hear...First off, the line/ordering process and menu. I've heard the saying \"if you got to ask the price, you probably can't afford it\" so I see a glimpse here and there of a menu board that's constantly being blocked by someone. It's written in script and there are no prices...so it's really hard to read if you're a noob. We're in line and don't want to lose our place to actually get a good look. That's really annoying because the menu is so close to the register that you're unprepared to order when it's your turn. So when I actually do get a clear view of the menu, I just grabbed what I know for sure I'll like- a French Dip. So now I'm getting a French Dip and I don't know what comes with it or even how much it's gonna cost me :/ Â so yeah, there's that.....we waited and waited but then rushed to order pretty much the first thing that caught our eye- not a fan of that. We ultimately ended up with a French Dip, a salad of some sort and a piece of carrot cake and two soft drinks. We are then told that we'd be told where to sit....ok, and that you have to share a table with people you don't know....that's odd but, ok I knew that coming in soooo. Let's just say, the place isn't \"user friendly\" Somewhere is the mix of dough and cream and sauces something was lost. That one ingredient that you can't do without, customer focus. It is all about us right? Ok, enough about that- let's get to the food- it's definitely part of why I'm here. So we get seated with our drinks and wait. While waiting we noticed everyone else was chowing down on their lunch or some bread. I started to wonder- were we supposed to order the bread? (Did we miss out in our hasty ordering?)I don't understand- finally we get the attention of a server and get some bread. Apparently they are supposed to give it to you when you get sat, but we were overlooked. :/ Â  So the bread was good, it comes with a small dish of olive oil herbs and balsamic vinaigrette. Takes the edge off while you wait for your food. Speaking of food, the wait was pretty short, maybe 15 minutes from when we ordered- not bad. The food was honestly kinda underwhelming to say the least. The roast beef was pretty good, the roll was terrible. It came out completely soggy and mushy. It was like that right away, before I even started trying to eat it. The roll was not substantial enough to hold the juice from the beef let alone dipping it in a jus. It was just a mushy mess. My wifes salad was just ok, she barely ate half of it. The plus was the carrot cake. We originally thought we'd take it home but it ended up being eaten there because my sandwich was small and she wasn't digging her salad so basically, it became lunch. So recap, French Dip- no sides, no fries and soggy- I think I paid like 11-12 dollars for it. Her salad was about the same price. Total for lunch $36 left hungry. The one surprise was the community seating. I thought I'd hate it but we actually enjoyed the people we met there and turns out we're neighbors- how funny being we live so far from the restaurant! So we ended up hanging out talking to them for quite some time towards closing time. That was cool. Would I go back based on what I saw today? Definitely not. The food was slightly below average, the atmosphere is akin to any strip mall restaurant. I don't like the ordering process and knowing what I know about the food- no way would I wait in line for that again. Been there done that, got the tee shirt- but ya never know until you try right?

The cake is also served with a delicious strawberry sauce.The service staff keeps the small dining room moving quickly, so don't be intimidated by the long live and packed tables, they usually seat you fairly promptly as the kitchen keeps things flowing.The assigned seating makes it less awkward finding a seat, as you may be seated with another party.
