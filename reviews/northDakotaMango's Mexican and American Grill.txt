We were sat right away, which was surprising because the restaurant was pretty full. Service was prompt and great. Our waitress was polite and nice. Food came in hot and fresh. Large servings and delicious food. Definitely recommend it if you are in the mood for Mexican food. One of the best in the area."}, {"review_id": "ymSMYpHkOgNQb3cQ-pJoLA", "user_id": "Cyng8a7LsvXZdWk7bYrr9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "Hands down the best Mexican restaurant in Fargo ND. Don't let the being attached to a gas station deter you. I've been here several times and each time I experienced great food! I had a tamale first followed by fajitas and there are large quality dishes! You won't leave dissatisfied! I always ask for the green salsa instead of using the hot sauce. If you like heat you will enjoy this!"}, {"review_id": "k5tk0v5twSZzI74HMzEstA", "user_id": "mBo3fPpjpotCY5BDrcKgVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Best Mexican food in town! It feels like home made and the service is great. I come almost every week. Chips are included and food is really good. The service is SO fast, 5-10 minutes and you have your food.

Don't let the exterior fool you. The menu is large. We had the Molcajete for 2 and it was wonderful and large portions! The service was excellent. Our margaritas came very quickly and when they came we were ready to order. Our order came out in less than 5 minutes! Amazing and hot. The flavor was excellent. My wife doesn't care for refried beans or guacamole, but she ate it all at Mangos.So impressed. The price was also a pleasant surprise. A meal for 2 and a couple of jumbo margaritas for under $40. Definitely will be back and back often! Give it a try! You won't be disappointed!"}, {"review_id": "-BZnlIud6F10461XsE6ZOA", "user_id": "saooOqCMJfLMhb09BfMIEg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/21/2017", "text": "Quick service and decent food when our group of 4 stopped in for lunch last week. Pretty good salsa with the requisite pre-meal chips, food came out hot, and the serving sizes were very reasonable.I had a tostada and enchilada - the tostada was a bit bland, but the enchilada had a pretty good flavor. A few of us just had water so the server brought a pitcher for us - nice touch, and she came back to check on us a few times. Since I'm an out-of-towner I may not have an opportunity to go back soon. Overall everything was fine, but unremarkable on this visit...I'd be willing to give it another shot when I'm in the area."}, {"review_id": "dOUGWC532Mx4aF6BCDtVQA", "user_id": "1aeYIwnraZSMZAUFBArxag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Fast and outstanding service, very authentic Mexican cuisine.

But I guess you just can't get great Mexican in the midwest. They have to cook for the local palate right? Service was quick and good. Margarita was too sweet and too weak. Chips were not house made that I could tell. Salsa had some flavor but very little heat and was nothing special. I had the carnitas and it was fine. Others have described the beans as very light here-- to me they were runny and insubstantial. I'd return if in Fargo again though. One time/dish isn't enough to form a good opinion, which is why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2."}, {"review_id": "QvQckTDLEcHkTUJnBa9AoQ", "user_id": "DwzRst27JCdyyg0LMmYx-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Best Mexican I've ever had!
