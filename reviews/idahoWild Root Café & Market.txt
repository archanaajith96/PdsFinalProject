So the four of us went out for some lunch. My Aunt is vegan/vegetarian and this place was perfect with plenty of vegan/vegetarian options. We ordered at the counter and waited a bit for our lunch. It was worth the wait. My Aunt loved her power bowl, Grams loved the soup de jour -asparagus bisque, and Indigo loved her toasted PB&B (peanut butter and banana). I had the market melt, a fancy cheese with rhubarb. I love ordinary food done up in an interesting way and Wild Root does it well with many menu items available in vegan fashion. Nice casual atmosphere, bathrooms are downtstairs (you need the key on a green ladle) and there weren't any changing tables. There was a nightstand, so we made it work.Indigo gives this place 30 stars for friendly customers and the best PB&B she's ever had."}, {"review_id": "GKfVOcB68Q8sKIKlPSv-1A", "user_id": "Ecct9zohQrsp6ZsT7NbY3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "ROSE NECTAR of the goddesses-much or mostly? organic, fresh 'n ZESTY, so very nutritious-I always bring out-of-town guests here 'cause what's not to love?-vegan, gluten-free, allergy-sensitive options galore-long lines often; prepare to wait a bit, though it is worth it-energy-giving fruits 'n veggies 'n grains -I'd eat here every other day if I lived nearby!!!-I wish they'd make meals, package them, and deliver them all over the area.

The banana pancakes though....some of the best things I have ever tasted. They have bourbon bananas and a salted caramel drizzle that you can't stop eating. The buckwheat pancakes are different, but very fluffy and have a great taste..plus they're gluten free. Can't say enough about this place.

Great for vegetarians.I ordered the chopped salad. As I was standing in line, I couldn't resist getting a vegan chocolate chip cookie from the cookie rack by the cashier - it looked so good, and the chocolate looked so gooey and melted. Yum. I wish they could have warmed it up, but it was very chocolatey and chewy. Probably one of the better chocolate chip cookies I've had BUT it was on the pricier side (it was $3, and it was pretty small).The chopped salad was AWESOME and their plating was beautiful. It was placed on a long rectangular plate, and the portion size was hearty. The avocado vinaigrette was delicious and creamy, and the grilled ciabatta bread slices were very unique. I've never had anything like the bread slices: they were kinda hard and some of them tasted a little like fried dough. Some bread pieces were yummier than others, and a few I had to really gnaw at (it kinda hurt my jaws). But still delicious. The chicken was chewy, and not tough at all. Awesome, awesome.Would definitely return."}, {"review_id": "OM0tmBk_TqLYw7a-fxRuKA", "user_id": "d2ryFUO3X4cnDIAC_7bg_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "The food here is very good, creative and served in reasonable portions. I'm very glad to have a restaurant like this in Boise and it will be a regular stop.This is an exceptional place for vegetarians and vegans as well. Every dish I've tried here has been phenomenal. The mix of flavors and preparation are surprisingly good for a restaurant like this. Often in my experience food at more natural food restaurants lacks flavor or flair, you won't have that problem here. I only had one complaint about the food and it was that they use too much oil for my liking which is part of the reason I took off one star.This place is popular and busy which is great and problematic at the same time. The last time I went there they got both of our orders wrong and they had to be sent back to be corrected. On Saturday afternoons this place is packed, getting a seat means you'll be waiting a while and the seating is pretty close together because the space is small so you'll definitely be hearing your neighbor. I love their use of eggs, they have dishes you wouldn't expect to see eggs on and they are surprisingly good. The combination of food and flavor here really makes Wild Root stand out. Their soups are nothing short of amazing!If you are downtown looking for a healthy, delicious place to get great food be sure to stop in, you'll be glad you did."}, {"review_id": "3P9DE0RpuXFlaKOMAZR2-Q", "user_id": "zxn9ZlFJKTTddjF6Du7rRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Wow what a fabulous breakfast, we both ordered the avocado toast with scrambled eggs.

Sharp.  Lunch is served until 3:00.  On days when dinner is served it starts at 3:00 and goes to 8:00...I think....have yet to try dinner but I'm eager to do it.VIBESparking clean and bright with big windows looking out to the sidewalk patio on 8th street which has seating during good weather months.  Chartreuse and white color scheme inside with cool lighting and modern design.  Laminate tables and molded chairs for seating.  All is at standard table height.  (Hooray, I dislike high perch seating.)  Tables are pretty tightly spaced.  SERVICEIt does not get better than this for friendly folks!DRILLOrder at the counter and be prepared for a line out the door if you go at lunch hour, even starting as early as 11:15.  The menu is on an electronic board to the right of the counter as you enter.  Place your order, you'll get a number card and they'll deliver to your table when ready.  Bus your own when done.  DON'T MISS EATSWe have yet to have a single menu item of the couple of dozen we've tried that we wouldn't order again.  All wonderful.  I'd give a personal shout out to the sweet potato hash at breakfast.  \"Knife and fork\" French toast creations are pretty splendid too.  And the falafel bowl.  Every soup.  Well...too many favorites to mention.  Every option  has been delicious.  Great coffee here too at a pump pot kept filled with hot brewI'm not embarrassed to say that on the days my hubby and I plan to eat at Wild Root for lunch we take a cooler along in the car with us as we know we'll have leftovers to go given the servings are so generous.  Sharing here can be a good idea for lighter eaters if you can agree on what to share. Our issue we want to try it all. :-)  And we always pause to enjoy how beautiful the food looks when delivered to the table.  A feast for the eyes too.\"THE DAMAGE\"Prices here are uber reasonable considering portions and quality of food.  There is something for every budget with things like soup and breakfast sides as little as $5 or less.  Main dish salads, sandwiches, breakfast plates and so on run $10 \"ish\", plus or minus. THE HITCHThe just-shy of five stars for me is simply a matter of process (stand in line to order, bus your own) and infrastructure limits (tables are tightly spaced, the loo is in the basement and is not wheelchair user accessible, downtown parking anywhere near 8th is a bear).  ACCESSIBILITYLevel in the door and all on one floor.  While tables are standard height, they do not maintain 36\" clear between them so it will be difficult for a wheelchair user to access many of them, but a few do work.  Clear path of travel to  counter and to coffee station.  The loo is in the basement and accessible via elevator.  Does not meet ADA ; stall set up for ambulatory person (walker, crutches, cane) but inaccessible to a wheelchair user.  PARKINGGood luck with that on 8th street any time of day."}, {"review_id": "wF5aOCXGxrKq7o2b7UQ82A", "user_id": "lnlF9N7VjgYNTBukol7UZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Had a great breakfast here!
