All of us ordered something different and enjoyed each dish, sides, & wine pairing. The ambiance was nice and classy (not too noisy, but lively). We got a round table (for 6) and were able to hear each other without trouble.But I would like to call special attention to our server Linda D., who was not only knowledgeable about the entire menu and offered great suggestions, but her interaction and enthusiasm elevated it from a good meal to great experience.  Seriously - all 6 people dining commented that she was as important as anything on the table.  Needless to say, we will all be back - and specifically ask for Linda D. to be our server (plus, she has a charming British accent, and a wicked sense of humor)."}, {"review_id": "CvL3XuYatojVkYC_PkllWw", "user_id": "P0eZEdycDIp86NS5tdEORg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "WOW, fabulous B'day dinner! Located at Ceasar's Shops in the Forum (love coming here). Best steak I have ever had (nice crusty sear on outside, pink and juicy interior). They serve a little bowl of salt/steak seasoning on the side, was excellent!Never before gotten excited by a restaurant Bread bowl. WOWSER. Joe's has 6 kinds of bread-- a corn muffin to die for (!!), parmesan crisp, pretzel roll, fruit/nut bread, etc. Outstanding! One should not fill up on bread before a big meal, but in this case.....Started with Stone Crab claws (for those unaware, they're served COLD). Succulent and sweet, fun to crack & get the meat. Loved the accompanying sauce (mayo/ horseradish). Didn't know they remove the claws from the crabs and throw them back in the sea, where the crabs live to grow another set of claws. So no crabs were killed in the making of your appetizer!Staff were excellent. Our server, Raul, did an outstanding job. Between courses, they come by and squeeze fresh lemon on your hands and give you a hot hand towel.Hubs' steak was great too (I had NY, he had Rib Eye), just cooked perfectly. Our side dish was Lyonnaise potatoes, so good, but who had room for them?!!?Got a complimentary ice cream brownie dessert for my B'day, a perfect ending to the fabulous meal. Food=A, Service= A++."}, {"review_id": "f4cxXQA2-mO4gE_7SHa93Q", "user_id": "uF9EkiFa_vQyV2TNbnpwyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "The perfect splurge date night restaurant! Joe's has the best stone crabs in the west coast. The crab claws are huge and taste delightful dipped in lemon or in butter. I've had Joe's multiple times and the quality of the food is consistent. The king crab claws are also very fresh and sweet. The tomahawk steak is also great too! The meat is seasoned well and is a great dish to eat if you have stone crabs too. The banana cream pie is so die for if you have a sweet tooth! Though it is pretty sweet, three or four big bites of this pie is perfect. The cream is so fluffy and pairs well with the cake itself. The atmosphere of the dining room is more proper and elegant, great for family dinners or date night. For a more casual meal, I would eat in the bar area or the tables outside."}, {"review_id": "iVontYJs15QPjSxPPTwqhA", "user_id": "Lngygc5fUOfXXNwaQ5Y2MA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The hubs, some friends, and I were looking for a place to grab a bite, Sunday evening. We walked right up and we were seated right away, which we appreciated.   I ordered the Ahi tartare, a Caesar salad, a Sangria, and the halibut special. My food was good. The halibut, a beautiful bone in cut of fish, but the preparation left a bit to be desired. I didn't finish it. It was a simple preparation, pepper & olive oil. It was not the best or worst piece of fish I've had. There was just nothing about it that made me want to finish it.    I also ordered a key lime pie, which was phenomenal. The hubs ordered the Havana dream pie, which was also good, but the key lime was better!    My husband got the steak tartare, a platter of oysters, and a ribeye. He agreed with me that the service and ambience were great, the entree was not the best he's ever had. The steak tartare was very good.    Our friend ordered a filet and seemed to be content.    Again, the ambience is nice, a classy & relaxed atmosphere. The service was outstanding.    The only complaint I do have, is about an hour or so later, I started feeling very ill, stomach cramps and all. My only guess is that someone unintentionally mishandled one of my food items. It was a bit disappointing to have a $400 dinner that made me sick. Again, this seems to be random because I saw no other issues on Yelp, so it was more than likely an unfortunate incident, but I would not return."}, {"review_id": "VPp2k_ufb1vV0J9-TGqs0A", "user_id": "_dbUc9A4V5m_cez_TDsiQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "This place is a GEM.

Our waiter suggested that we get the large portion of stone crab claw as the smaller size claws don't have much meat so we each got a claw and it just wasn't all that satisfying considering each claw costed close to $12/ea and was just cold boiled crab claws. Perhaps my high expectations got the better of me. However, I think everyone thought the entrees were all quite good. The ahi tuna steak was particularly interesting as it looked like a 2\" thick filet. Also I get to have my favorite key lime pie and it was definitely very satisfying."}, {"review_id": "KJcDAMarhQHG2TqA8-7hZw", "user_id": "9bIy5A9FjzZVlLwcrQkBhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I came here with my close girl friends and has a fabulous experience !

We went back twice. In a row. While we enjoyed our original meal, other items caught our eye. The location is worth finding as it is street level in the Caesars casino located in the forum shops. It's a small section kind of tucked away. Would recommend signage with the restaurant name to help us out. Back to the meal....I had a surf and turf offering and my husband the bone in filet. Side is creamed spinach-all his as I don't touch it! Baked sweet potato the size of 2 of my hands. Meat was juicy, tender, cooked to our liking. Sides were also tasty-well my potato had butter and cinnamon and pecans. Can't vouch for the greens but he ate them all so there's that! The second night it was late but we couldn't stop thinking about the shrimp that passed by us. We ordered that and I had the shaved prime rib sand which. We almost cried it was so good!!! Glad we went back. Thinking this will be a stop we always make when visiting.

Best birthday meal hands down. I had the crab stuffed shrimp and creamed spinach. The restaurant is a la carte. I'm usually too cheap to go to a la carte restaurants, but Joe's was SO worth it. Me and my girlfriends were in Vegas for my birthday, and the activity we did earlier that day pushed us into arriving at our Joe's reservation later. I called ahead and let them know about our later arrival time (about half an hour late). When I arrived, I nicely asked if they could give us straight service since we will have no time to converse as friends. They were so kind about the request. We received quick seating, and the waiter notified me that she was alerted about our shortness on time. Her service was quick, friendly, and they even made time to bring me a birthday brownie with ice. I will definitely be returning.

(The corn muffins in the breadbasket are dangerous and will fill you up, so don't go overboard)The steaks? An expensive afterthought. I've had a better steak at Texas Roadhouse... real talk. Luckily, I didn't order one here, but my date did. It was beautiful and the seasoning was impeccable, but the meat was muscle-like, tough--even with a medium well sear.  Thank God for the seafood platter--which contained three of the best lobster tails I've ever eaten. Honestly, I didn't care for the stone crab claws, I understand why they aren't served warm, but they were extremely watery and kinda bland. Some steam heat and a little garlic butter would've taken the to another level. I totally understand the attraction to this place-- reservations are necessary on the weekends and stick with the seafood--- crab cake, legs, lobster tails --you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "4U5-a8DFpdw6I4H7f1WQXA", "user_id": "RgWJJ0oUdszw2qjkTud07Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Highly recommended this place.

We finally had the opportunity to try this place since we were staying at caesars Palace. Since the restaurant is located in the forum shops, it is super close! It was totally worth it and so delicious! We made reservations they day off and it was the only time they had available so we got really lucky. You walk up to the host stand and it's this man who looks like he's been there a long time and really enjoys his job. It looks like an old school steakhouse that you would see in New York. Really cool. He took us to our table and I was surprised how big the restaurant was.We got the calamari as an appetizer and it was really good. Not too much breading where it was heavy with batter but just enough to be crunchy and perfectly cooked. The bread basket was amazing as well! All kinds of breads like corn bread, pretzel rolls, sweet rolls and some kind of crunchy flatbread. Yum! For entree I got the rib eye, my parents split the salmon and my sister got the seafood pasta. The steak was perfectly cooked and was seasoned perfectly and juicy. The salmon was perfectly cooked as well according to my parents and was already split per the restaurant. The salmon pieces were pretty big too! The seafood pasta was very impressive. Huge pieces of crab, lobster and shrimp all tossed in a pesto sauce with pasta. All the seafood was nicely cooked and very flavorful and fresh. Another huge portion! We also got a side of the mashed potatoes which were buttery and o so yummy!This was one of the better steakhouses that I've been too.

Crab bisque: so very good! I can eat this all day long. The Whale: seafood platter $28.95 per person. This was the only dish I'd skip next time. Lobster and shrimps were overcooked and tough. Large Stone Crab: $69.95 for 5 pieces. A little pricey but they were big and fresh. I'd like them saltier though, but at least it came with a mustard sauce to dip them in. King Crab Roll: good. Big chunks of king crabs instead of shredded ones. Fish n Chips: the best fish n chips ever! Crust was light and crispy.

I have heard really good things about it but unfortunately did not like it as much as I thought I would have.The service was okay, if that. I always try to keep in mind that it may have been a busy night, but it doesn't excuse the total lack of service we received. Our waiter barely came by our table. Maybe because we're younger and they assumed we would not tip. Who knows.The starter salad was mediocre but the bread was delicious. The steak was fantastic along with the brussell sprouts and mac and cheese. We tried the stone crab and I personally did not like it. It tasted too fishy to me and the cold turned me off. The dipping sauce on the side was good so thankfully we had that. All in all, it was decent. For the amount of money I don't think it was worth it. I can't say that I will be back, but I wouldn't turn people away from it.
