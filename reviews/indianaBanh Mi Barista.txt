Bahn Mi viet special and spring rolls were fresh, light, and tasty... just what you'd expect from a good Vietnamese place. Sandwich wasn't big, but it wasn't over priced, either. Spring rolls had multiple options and were made fresh.Service was super friendly and chatty.

I think my bf saw them microwaved the meats which clearly shows that it is not fresh. The baguette is not crunchy and it's just flat and dull. But the worse part is that it's overpriced for a sandwich when there's nothing fresh about it. :( As for the boba, it's mostly powder-base and obviously not fresh, either. I think the only thing I enjoyed getting here is the pork noodle. Maybe I like eating it is because I really miss Vietnamese foods. I wish I could love this place since I'm always looking for some good Vietnamese food but... I'm just not a fan of this place and also letting Chef Mic doing all the work."}, {"review_id": "dUTIFgcHu_qygXdz2L6PgA", "user_id": "nLVh9PtqRgEsYr3KFl22Og", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "So Saigon in Fort Wayne is my favorite for beef pho. The day we came to this establishment was the one day a week Saigon was closed. We were craving pho. It was decent. I never had it with sausage in it. They were also out of some of the sauce we add to the pho. So deducted a star for that."}, {"review_id": "kMmcIyw0U0C11Ua24kJveQ", "user_id": "Axqu0a3ss8Haawz6eMhCgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Good Bahn Mi sandwich. The special or the Korean BBQ are solid go to. The Pho is tasty just lacks that extra something.

My office is next to Westminster and Garden Grove. Large Vietnamese community. Vietnamese restaurants are everywhere; Pho is like water and air there. It's a necessity. Coming to Ft Wayne, I was having pho withdrawals. I came here and got Chicken Pho (Pho Ga) and Pork Sandwich (Banh Mi). And it was delicious!!! The sandwich was served on a soft hoagie which is perfect because other places use a hard French baguette and it always cuts up my mouth. This bread was soft and easy to eat. The meat had an awesome char flavor and the pickled daikon, carrot, and cucumber was my favorite part. It was yummy. The chicken Pho was the perfect portion for $8. The noodles were good and the broth had that complexity aroma that Pho is known for. It came with a side of bean sprouts, lime, and basil leaves. There is hoisin sauce, sriracha, fish sauce on the table. The service was super warm and nice! She was so sweet and came to check on me to make sure I liked my food. Great place!"}, {"review_id": "boy6e_UMb9QRG9G4kiT2nw", "user_id": "2V1Y6F6_AkLx6P8R_bBn7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/17/2017", "text": "My coworkers & I decided prior to the New Year to try a new place that we hadn't been to, once a month. Banh Mi Barista got the lucky draw to kick off our food adventures in 2017.This place could easily be missed & is likely overlooked by most, as it is located in a small strip mall off of Coldwater Road. I've driven by it for years, but glad I finally pulled into this place tonight. Great service & super accommodating staff - they made my request of trying one of each of the spring rolls happen. While I thought I would prefer the shrimp and pork spring roll, as I typically gravitate to non-vegetarian dishes, I was proven that vegetarian dishes are sometimes better. I would most definitely get the vegetarian spring roll from now on.I asked the staff their favorite sandwich, and they said definitely the \"Korean BBQ\". As one who isn't a huge fan of spicy, I opted for the mild version of the sandwich. It was super flavorful and yummy. My colleague got the same sandwich, but \"spicy\" and said it lived up to its title. If the spices aren't enough for you, there are plenty of spices on the table to choose from.Conclusion: I'd definitely come back here again and if you haven't yet tried this place you've driven by hundreds of times - stop in!"}, {"review_id": "BpAEy8DemoqjD5JUGIuvLA", "user_id": "wiBlu3XXBhQ1HO6lpG5tWg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2016", "text": "I have been wanting to try these small restaurant for a while but just never seemed to have the time. Well yesterday my sister and I made time. We went for lunch, and boy let me tell you parking is tight. We got in and found an open table....not going to lie we struggled for a few minutes deciding if we thought they were coming to us or if we needed to go there the counter to order.I got the shrimp and pork spring roll and the beef pho. Both were ....good but not amazing. The spring rolls were served cold in a clear wrapper. It tastes like a sandwich especially with a he tasty ginger sauce they serve it with.The pho was hot and fragrant when it came out. It comes with a very small amount of cilantro, a half of a wedge of lime, bean sprouts and licorice mint l aves (I think). It was good with the exception of the slices of meatball in it.All and all probably the last time I go since Siegon was so much tastier, and cheaper."}, {"review_id": "qrkUQ7ytM513iCgpv2mGOg", "user_id": "JoD7pGDZ756eE3WypxTTAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/12/2017", "text": "The restaurant is in a small strip center with limited parking. The exterior is nondescript, but clean. The interior space is brightly painted and well-lit - nothing special, but clean and quiet. At 11:30 on Monday, several guests were already enjoying meals.Patrons order food at the counter and it is brought to your table. I was greeted warmly and was asked if I had questions about the menu. The establishment offers a variety of noodle and rice dishes as well as Vietnamese sandwiches and bubble teas. I ordered the familiar Beef Pho with no white onions; my special request was acknowledged twice. My meal was served promptly and correctly. A side dish contained lime, bean sprouts, cilantro, and basil so I could garnish the pho to my liking; hoisin sauce, sriracha, and more were on the table next to a napkin dispenser.This was the 4th Vietnamese restaurant I've visited and this one served the best pho I've tasted. The balance of noodles and broth was perfect and it contained very tender sliced Beef with no gristle as well as sliced meatballs. The dish was fantastic from start to finish.This restaurant is a little off my usual paths but I will be back to try the sandwiches and tea. Well done, Bahn Mi Barista!"}, {"review_id": "THwlaX_lHNhMEPgv60QLUA", "user_id": "DsxjPPVFs4Hdb07K8WNwfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2017", "text": "I had a really great experience here.

Their boba drinks are delicious and the avocado is one of the best! I would like to get a new flavor each visit but I can't seem to give up the avacado. And the Vietnamese coffee is on point. Their banh mi (Vietnamese style sub sandwiches) are all tasty. I suggest the Korean BBQ or Viet special. If you don't like spicy, ask for the peppers on the side. The bread is ok but that's me nit-picking since I've had really good French bread for banh mi. The banh mi here is some of the best in Indiana imo. The pho and fresh spring rolls are also a must try. There's a vegetarian option for each type of dish but veggie pho is only available on Mondays. The setting is casual and family friendly with workers that are helpful and kind. Prices are reasonable for what you get.

Look no further than this little Vietnamese shop on coldwater then!I've gotten the chicken Pho multiple time from here, and while the portions are smaller than the other place I go (Kim Vu) it is definitely packed with monumental flavor. Additionally, it's worth to splurge an extra few bucks for their spring rolls. They're crispy and not at all greasy. It's nice to have to option to buy home cooked food in this region of Ft Wayne, as well, because a lot of restraurants up here are chains. Chains can be a solid option, but sometimes it's nice to have the option of fresh ingredients. Bahn Mi Barista serves up flavorful Asian cuisine at a price point and taste level that I can surely get behind!"}, {"review_id": "DsGlL7U3_4CG5W9t5wUTmQ", "user_id": "UbkvjCOjTZCKWaVcolZYdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2017", "text": "A must in fort wayne!
