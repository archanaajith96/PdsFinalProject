I love their avocado toast and their seasonal menu (pumpkin pancakes were quite life-changing). I also ordered something along the lines of a Lox bagel with arugula on of the times I went--I STILL have dreams about this otherworldly bagel. What a bae-goal kind of bagel. It's not on the menu anymore but I'm sure they could recreate it for ya! #baegoalsHard truth: pricier than iHop, but immensely better quality so it's worth it. The freshness of their ingredients is so evident, even in the little fruit cup side dishes (which, to my surprise, were not diluted with apple and cantaloupe chunks but had great variety--blueberries, raspberries, pineapples, etc). It's usually packed for brunch on weekends so I would call in advance if you're in a hurry! You can also order to-go at the front."}, {"review_id": "A3Yshwe0711SWSCnfNs_nw", "user_id": "0O1iwcdZWETbIXonv2UAGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "Very tasty Great pricesFriendly staffHealthier breakfast optionsKid friendlyGreat for larger families Would recommend!"}, {"review_id": "IycJep_bRZxLZcSVBbM_KQ", "user_id": "f8uo1sMq7cqH1SklqDcDhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Millionaire bacon  is perfection!!!

We were only visiting Tulsa for 2 days and decided to have Sunday brunch here. Best decision ever. We waited maybe 20 minutes before we were seated and our server immediately poured me some coffee (key to my heart). The menu is so long and that's always a good thing in my eyes because that means I can keep coming back to try different items! PSA though: you have to get the chickichanga. It's absolutely delicious and what's not to love about it? You have chicken and avocado wrapped in a tortilla that's lathered with sauce and topped with sour cream. Plus, you have a side of potatoes as well as some fresh fruit for some sweetness. It's a full meal and I couldn't find one flaw in it. With outstanding service from start to finish, a delicious meal that left me stuffed with extra as leftovers and a reasonable bill, I left with all smiles. I had no idea this is a chain restaurant and that makes me so happy because it doesn't feel like they are a chain. This location was able to have authentic flavors and really have a unique local feel to the restaurant which can't be duplicated."}, {"review_id": "1CtxGO1RwDsCKij6OxFVMg", "user_id": "ctbfMnEZbth117lhlps85w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Great food.

The staff greeted me immediately upon entering and I found the service to be excellent.   I ordered the eggs Benedict classic.  The food arrived very quickly and looked fantastic.  Great presentation.  The seasoned potatoes were tasty. Well seasoned and seared crispy on one side.  The eggs Benedict was underwhelming. Overall it needed seasoning. I'm not a fan of a warm tomato (unless it's charred) and it seemed to water down the dish without adding any flavor.  The hollandaise Sauce did not pack a punch.   Overall I enjoyed my visit but will try something else on the menu next time."}, {"review_id": "-5Dqlp-f5GlmYAnUE0UpIQ", "user_id": "P8QYewzctqU7g9bqfgLcjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Great greasy spoon that's also has a ton of healthy options.

But 2 people, the wait was only 15 minutes, and with the free coffee station nearby, the 15 minutes flew by.Once we were seated in a comfy booth by the windows, our waiter quickly took care of our drink orders: moar coffee for me, kale juice for E. As I perused the menu, I was happy to see that there were tons of options, not just all around, but for the veg-inclined as well. A lot of variety was to be seen in this menu. We ended ordering the same thing: Eggs Florentine with seasoned potatoes and a poppyseed muffin to-go. And as I took that first bite of Eggs Florentine, no wonder First Watch was packed! The food was excellent. I loved how the potatoes were prepared: soft but crispy on the outside. The Eggs Florentine had perfectly poached eggs. The choice of placing the eggs and their accouterments of spinach, avocado, tomato, and arugula on top of one piece of ciabatta bread was an interesting one, but nothing a good knife can't handle. And that poppyseed muffin? Yeah, I couldn't wait for to-go. I ended up devouring it while still at the table, but it was one of the best muffins I've had in a while. Fresh, home-baked, and so. many. poppy seeds. Thank goodness I didn't have to take a drug test that day!Service was great throughout and we didn't have to wait too long to pay for our meals upfront. It was a great first experience at First Watch, and I am definitely trying the First Watch in OKC now."}, {"review_id": "0oXHTht2BG5PmuT5bx8exg", "user_id": "gDPZlywYc1-TvaZxcwTW1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I love eating breakfast at this delicious place!

Do not be deterred, this place is anything but a Denny's. We were greeted and taken care of by very friendly staff (around 7:45am, they must be morning people). David, our waiter, was very friendly, attentive, patient, and energetic. He is the waiter I would like to have as our waiter every time we go.The menu was filled with fresh healthy options. I ended up choosing the Smoked Brisket Hash and let me tell you, you could never go wrong with this dish. I was amazed at the sweet and savory flavors and how all of the they came together as they danced across my tongue. The boyfriend had the Acapulco Express Omelette. He enjoyed the spiciness of the chorizo, green chilies, and the housemade salsa. We also liked that the ketchup was high fructose corn syrup free, the salt and pepper shakers were made from recycled glass, did not use plastic cups for the sauces, and the takeout containers are compostable. The attention to the tiny details really stands out as this restaurant not only serves fresh food, but is environmentally conscious."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/first-watch-tulsa-6?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
