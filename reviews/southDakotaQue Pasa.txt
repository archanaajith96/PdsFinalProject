Was on a short trip to Rapid City when we decided to beat the snow blizzard by trying out Mexican food. We were served by server Tony who was pretty good and gave us ample amount of time to decide upon our items. We ordered Veggie Fajitas and Chicken Enchilada which were flavorful and had big portions. The Fajitas were accompanied by sizzling veggies, salsa, sour cream, guacamole and corn cake which was damn good!Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to others if you are in the city!"}, {"review_id": "6n22DbLay3glaBrHHTBJrA", "user_id": "CoULkkk4RQ2q5yfT6ULdCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Stopped in here on a whim because it was close to my hotel and the curb appeal was great.  I was not let down inside it was creatively decorated and a great random pick overall.  Service was top notch too even in the off season.  I can't remember what its called but they have a pineapple/Serrano pepper margarita that is AMAZING!  Street tacos were pretty great too.  Check this one out!"}, {"review_id": "IVZlmOIuN_zVUOG56XdOeQ", "user_id": "gB97cH1Q72D_ZOPcXuAZ5g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Go for the margaritas & patio, stay for the chips & salsa- leave before you order food.

Upon arriving in Rapid City, we were in need of a break and human fuel and remembered the billboards, so though we'd give it a shot. The server was friendly and prompt, bringing us free chips and salsa and frequently filling our waters. When I asked him what's good on the menu, he said \"everything\". We ordered the veggie fajitas and a veggie burrito w/ chicken and we weren't disappointed. The place was clean and had fun music and décor. Would stop here again if ever in the area."}, {"review_id": "RBMRUPDgBKhPUYZO3dqrFw", "user_id": "Cg-mtLddNSzKUn7Y_btjdg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Great location with an amazing outdoor eating area.

The staff was friendly and we were seated quickly. They brought our waters out right away, along with chips and salsa for the table. I really enjoyed the chips. They seemed house made and were thin and crispy. We got margaritas and they were tasty. I got the Kick ass marg- it wasn't overly spicy, but it had a nice flavor with the muddled pineapple. There was not a strong alcohol flavor, so I suspect they might have been on the weak side. The food came out incredibly quickly. we shared the carne asada burrito and the chicken enchilada with the chili rellenos. They were both just okay. We got the red and green sauce on them. They had no real pizzazz to them. I would have loved if the meat was marinated or seasoned, and the sauces could have used some spice or kick. The food was plated very nicely, and there was nothing offensive. I am just used to Mexican cuisine with more in-your-face flavor."}, {"review_id": "ycBI5ZeXOyv2YbBGDkjqjA", "user_id": "VzlX5LJ7__pl6AaBWBiw9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "I will admit I'm grading on a curve here: it's Mexican food in South Dakota. While the slow roasted carnitas were a little tough so I'm not sure they were really roasted for 12 hours, the food wasn't bad and the salsa on the table had a decent kick. Service was a hot mess. Part of it was the bar messing up my order (which they comped the drink without any prompting; I was just happy that they cheerfully replaced it) but overall there were a lot of missteps. I don't think my server was experienced or well trained. She has room to grow. She would alternate between trying to rush me and not paying attention to her tables. What evens out the meal (and earns them some stars) is the patio. It's a pleasant place to linger with a drink and watch the world go by. I will forgive an inexperienced server if I have an opportunity to chill. And this is a perfect place for that. Come here, grab a table outside, and savor a moment."}, {"review_id": "ir2Z0ZNdFkXmqYoqqF19DA", "user_id": "3pu1M0dXEk8cTx6FyyVemA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "We liked Que Pasa a lot.

Everything that we got, the salsa, queso, and both my boyfriend's and I'd entrees were extremely bland. Nothing had any taste. The waitress spilled our drinks on the table and didn't clean them up. My boyfriend got the brisket sandwich with fries (which makes no sense to me to put on a Mexican restaurant menu) and no only did the fries come complete unseasoned and unsalted it was drenched in grease. I asked the waitress if I could get two cheese enchiladas but she told me they did not do a la carts and I could only get the chicken enchilada on the menu. So that's what I got and the rice was bland, the cheese was hard. Overall a complete let down. And it's hard to mess up enchiladas if you ask me.
