The burgers looked delicious, all the meat being sourced from local farmers. I ended up ordering the vegetarian burger and it did not disappoint. It was seasoned well and flavourful. The side salad came with a tangy vinaigrette and was great. My friends also enjoyed the turkey burger and the classic farmhouse burger.Great service with friendly staff.

We both had burgers.  I had the salad with mine instead of fries and I wish I'd ordered more of the salad.  It was scrumptious.  Get the buttermilk vinaigrette-yum!  We ate here around 5:00, as we were leaving at 6 there was a line out the door.

Was very surprised at the New York City pricing. I understand their claim is everything is locally sourced and perhaps that is why the prices are so high, but $19 for fish and chips???  Perhaps the fish was a trout caught in Lake Champlain!  A burger was $17. My fish and chips were good but not to the tune of $19. The service was good, friendly and relatively quick.

Of course I turned to Yelp and HUZZAH! The Farmhouse Tap showed up, exactly what I was looking for: beer and vegetarian options. It's a really cute, modern place right on the main Church Street drag of Burlington. The decor is that contemporary farmhouse look, lots of mismatched wood and hammered tin.My gals and I rolled in on a Saturday late, like 2, which is normally restaurant dead time, but they were still rocking. Only about a 20 minute wait though. They seemed to have an efficient turn around. They offer a lot of local and seasonal beers on tap. They don't do a flight, but you can order a small 6 oz. of any beer. For brunch, I had the egg salad sandwich which was either really amazing, or just felt that way because I was REALLY hungry. But it did have little fried onion rings on it so I'm assuming it was really good. Definitely worth a stop if you're in Burlington and looking for some good, local eats and an assortment of beer."}, {"review_id": "5XeS92XsuZc0ocG7typOSA", "user_id": "m5RUnrlPPZpTWwQi-XFu3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "This review is LONG over due! We went here in August of 2017 when we were traveling around the country in search of our new home. On our first night in VT, we were walking around, unsure of where we wanted to go to eat. A few weeks prior, a stranger we met in line at a brewery in MA recommended this place to us for their great beer selection, so we went!Thanks to Yelp, we were able to put our names on the waiting list right from the app! We arrived a little early, and they were super busy, so we helped ourselves to a local beer at the bar while we waited. Their beer selection alone was very impressive, but they had a ton of other stuff too. We got seated right away, and decided on the burger special of the night which was EXCELLENT. Most of their ingredients are locally sourced from farms in the area, which I really liked! I'm sure they have their mainstay items, but don't be afraid to try the specials! We certainly were not disappointed. We ate inside that night, as it was a bit chilly out, being late August, but they do have a nice outdoor area for warmer nights or days. We would certainly be back! Thanks for the recommendation random stranger in line at Tree House!

The atmosphere: loud, packed, chaotic. And apparently it doesn't matter the time of day because my husband and I were there for an early dinner. We were placed at a wobbly high top table in the middle of the restaurant...and apparently the middle of the walkway as well. Patrons and staff were constantly knocking into my husband's chair. The table next to us was so close that as they were getting up to leave and say their goodbyes they were literally rubbing onto our arms. So. Weird.Every other spot in the restaurant looked cozy so I really don't understand the table right where everyone is walking...not to mention you feel all the draft from the door opening while people waiting for a table stare you down as they stand in the nonexistent waiting area.My husband and I ordered the same exact thing...and they came out with the wrong order. We told them right away and they fixed it but I had a feeling this was going to happen as our waitress was barely paying attention to us at all. The manager (I believe) seemed to be running around keeping things in order but it was a little distracting to watch him carry trash back and fourth...They do have a great beer selection.My husband and I both had burgers which were tasty but not incredibly so. I've had a better burger elsewhere for $10 not $16. And they really aren't big so I guess I don't understand the price. It satisfied our hunger but the stressful and annoying atmosphere would keep me away in the future ."}, {"review_id": "qHGi6IIWUwSCKki7iZTfDw", "user_id": "AuEHPR3Fj7qsuRWiXRy0yA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Went there for dinner...

Sadly, I did not have a chance to try any of their famed dishes, but as an FYI this restaurant is known for their beers and burgers. Came here on a Friday night around 6:15 and was told the wait would be 40 min for a table of 1. Luckily, they have a good system where you can leave your phone number and they'll send you a text when the table is ready, which meant I was free to spend that time strolling through the scenic downtown area and hole up in nearby coffee shop with some cider. The table was ready by the time I arrived and the service was impeccable. I ordered the mushroom soup and the lobster ravioli and was very impressed by the flavoring for both. They were both rich and succulent, and the lobster ravioli in particular wowed me because of the lovely orange sauce they were drenched in. The bill came out to $30, including tax and tip, which was a bit surprising considering that I was nowhere near a major city, and the portions I ate are quite small, but I guess that's paying for the quality of food. I would definitely want to come back and try more of their food the next time I'm in Vermont!"}, {"review_id": "_REownSYHG_sYdspD9V7-w", "user_id": "Z4wvyYC58FLjjPSPa0de1Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "3.5 Stars. Came here during brunch on the thanksgiving weekend driving back from Montreal. My friends and I - 3 of us spent a day at Burlington and decided to give this place a try while stopping by the nearest Church Market Place. We decided to get the egg bennies with ham, hash & eggs, and the pork kimchi burger. The good news is that the food quality was solid and portion was just about right, and at least the eggs were perfectly cooked. Being able to a proper egg is a minimum requirement for any brunch places. However, we are talking about going above and beyond here. In order for any place to win me over, you'll need something more special than average. All of the dishes at FH were solid but not necessarily spectacular. Something seems missing from egg bennies and has & eggs and I felt like I've had better of those dishes elsewhere. The pork kimchi burger was good but I remembered the kimchi did not taste as strong as I hoped.  When I hear the word kimchi I was expecting spicy & kick, but I was just getting the watered down version of it. But anyhow, don't let these slightly negative feedback deterred you. I think it is still a worthwhile place to check while you are visiting from out of town..but I wouldn't put it on the top of must eat bucket list."}, {"review_id": "icwiICBxMgNT--z-sSKN0w", "user_id": "ZxV0GKK5L_MIE8qWD-b21w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "Aaaaaamazing.

The menu is elegant, yet rustic, and certainly not over priced. I had the scallop crudo to start. I cant begin to tell you how delicious the buttery scallop was with the lemon and olive oil. I believe this is a dish that changes daily, however I really hope they consider adding this to the menu permanently. I also had the chicken and biscuits which were amazing, as well as the maple cheesecake. My only concern was that my biscuits were a bit heavy, however, I just relocated from North Carolina so I have pretty high biscuit standards. I will certainly be back...

This restaurant is the epitome Burlington, VT. The menu consists of locally sourced ingredients and craft brews. I ordered the Misty Knoll Free Range Turkey, replacing the buns with sauteed kale for an additional charge, and chose the house salad as a side. Everything was well prepared and seasoned! The salad was crisp with just enough dressing to coat. The turkey burger wasn't dry and you could taste the blue cheese throughout the patty. Since my friend and I came relatively early, the restaurant did not put the specials out until we were done with the meal in preparation for the dinner hours. I should have asked for the specials as I would have tried one of those dishes, but would happily come back to this establishment when I am back in the area."}, {"review_id": "EFn7gtDT2yrspR7zmWqHgw", "user_id": "eqS5lpxVMEzS_xaGP8NW_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Happened upon the place as soon as we got to Burlington.

We used the Yelp app to get on the \"waitlist\" before arriving. We were seated very promptly which was nice. Considering it was 4th of July day in downtown, it was nice to get seats so quickly even though the restaurant was very full.We ordered the onion rings which were super well prepared. They came out fresh and hot. The onion itself is not thick cut but a bit thinner which isn't usually my favorite but they tasted really good and were seasoned well. They were served on top of a really tasty tartar sauce. So if you don't love tartar sauce ask for without.The waitress also brought out four, house made, sauces (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and hot sauce) we tried them all and all were top notch. Try the hot sauce, it's bright orange!We also ordered a variety of beers and ciders which were all really good. Their selection is really amazing and the waitress was really knowledgeable of their offerings.All three of us ordered their farmhouse burger with all the accompaniments. One of us added an egg which came sunny side up and skillfully prepared. Waiters and waitresses were plenty available to fill water and check on us. My only critique was that I thought $16 for a burger was a tad bit expensive but for the \"environment\" they offer I think that's the extra couple dollars that you are paying. The outdoor beer garden is really cute too."}, {"review_id": "bU4Ykca978SrYTR86u-e0Q", "user_id": "TfSnkfJFrjyyuuNDc9l8JA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "A great spot for a good lunch while drinking local beers.
