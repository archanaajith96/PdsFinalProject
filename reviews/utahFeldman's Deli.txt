Maybe just a little bit of courage. Some good ol' fashioned \"I'mma do what I want.\" And I like it.Reject the notion that you know what this place is all about. Ya, if you must describe it to someone, you might say it has a hint of Jewish deli in it, or that it rings out like a New York delicatessen. But if you go purely with those expectations in mind, you probably will be disappointed or unfulfilled, or just confused.Sandwiches, friends. It begins and ends with sandwiches here. They're huge. They're spendy. They're meaty. Take the Sloppy Joe for example. It's not some loose meat sandwich like the typical sandwich by that name. No, Joe is all grown up and full of layers of meat--too much for one person alone. You can't go wrong with the Reuben. Come on the weekend and get a bagel. The decor is just a tad funky, the owners are real people and seem to be personally invested in the day-to-day, and it's a brave spot in SLC.Here's the thing about being brave: it's honest. You have to be honest to yourself. Being brave, and being honest, it's what makes you happy. If you're not happy, be honest with yourself, and then do the brave thing to get to where you know you'll be happy. Feldman's, maybe?"}, {"review_id": "KljQA_Mt_YoDSXRRRumuAA", "user_id": "bfaP-BksFx5pJERV3HQuCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "We have had lunch here a few times already and really wanted to try the breakfast.

Usually, when I eat food this good I almost immediately head to yelp out of sheer excitement. I came here over a year ago, but based on the yelp average, I don't think my endorsement is that vital. This place is amazing, and it seems most of yelp agrees. I'm not Jewish, I know nothing about what is authentic vs non authentic. What I do know, is what I put in my mouth here was delicious. For whatever reason I've wanted to try matzo ball soup since I first heard about it, and let's just say I was not disappointed, it was straight up delicious. Warm and flavorful. It's that perfect balance of comfort food satisfaction without being overtly heavy.I'm such a huge fan of reuben sandwiches, I don't know how to properly articulate it. Other than to say I've had many in my lifetime, ranging from obscenely meat overloaded to vegan. This is one of the best I've had. I'm a french fry type of gal, so I usually go for that but you have options here, coleslaw, potato salad, \"health salad\". An abundance of other menu items that I intend to try now that I've moved not only back to Salt Lake, but in very close proximity to Feldman's. The wait time may be perhaps the only deterrent. Because this is a semi small, nice little communal feeling restaurant you may not get the opportunity to be seated immediately. But I do highly recommend. The staff are cool here, and even if they weren't, I'd still probably come here because it's that good. I think the fact that many of the reviews on here, positive or negative, have responses from the owner speaks volumes. It's clear this is a restaurant that prides itself on being more than just about good food, but a good dining experience overall."}, {"review_id": "9uIctjwAqb5yHGcbURBeRQ", "user_id": "88GHHxe4NZmofzCh-Nn2CA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "The food is OUTSTANDING and the owner is such a great guy.  I brought my mom in for a sandwich (she is a back east Mom) and she and the owner must've talked for 20 minutes (he's an east coaster, too).  She just loved that.  I get the Sloppy Joe EVERY time I go, I just have to.  Get this, please!  Cheers to this wonderful neighborhood deli, I love it!"}, {"review_id": "VgKny5tlftgbgch6ZIqSFg", "user_id": "ShJqY9LNWzsQb1MJMINawA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Hands down- the best salmon I have ever had.

The flavor is incredible and the size is much larger than any normal person needs on their own. The specials always look amazing, but I can never talk myself out of just getting the original...just because I don't want to miss out on another chance to get it.  They even have the fries down with the perfect crispness and generous portions. The sandy is a little pricey ($15ish) but I view it as two sandwiches as I usually split it with my wife with a large salad too...so still feel good about the value.  Plus there is usually a coupon around somewhere.Be sure to be hungry and you will walk out more than satisfied.  This is a stop everyone needs to make."}, {"review_id": "8LjIIIVdiKXVVrIok_rZog", "user_id": "InInjzaZxzQ8_suxZEAP5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "Thank heaven for Feldman's Deli. There are only two places in the greater SLC area that make a top-notch Reuben (corned beef and pastrami with sauerkraut): 1. Siegfried's German Deli downtown and 2. Feldman's Deli right off the corner of 27th South and 20th East in Sugar House. While Siegfried's goes more into the very tasty German cuisine, Feldman's is all about sandwiches. I don't think anywhere in the Valley stacks the meat as high as Feldman's. Oh sure, it's not the leaning tower of pastrami they'll put on a Reuben at the Carnegie or Katz's Delis in NYC, but those mofos are just showing off anyway. You'll be full when you leave Feldman's, doing the dance between a plate-lickingly good Reuben and the Pastrami sweats. I'll take Feldman's just-full-enough feeling any day of the week ... and the $20 extra I'll have in my pocket not paying NYC prices! Another thing I like is Feldman's isn't laser-focused just on the Reuben; thus, they're not just obsessed with their Corned Beef and Pastrami. They've made a line of .... shall I say \"Reubenesque\" sandwiches. Some with cole slaw, some with turkey, all grilled on Jewish rye with swiss and thousand island dressing ... and all yummy. Whatever meal you get, I recommend getting it in a combo. That way you can try their amazing homemade potato salad or surprisingly great fries (surprising because delis usually do well at the deep fryer).  Along with the unbelievably good classic and Pastrami Reubens are several other takes on the great sandwich. There's the Rachel (pastrami and slaw), the Ross .... oh, wait, I mean the Trisha (turkey and slaw, my personal fave), the Corned Beef Rachel, Turkey Reuben, and the Hemingway SJ (all the Reuben extras but ham and beef tongue as the meat ... it's better than it sounds!). There are other options, but I never stray too far from the Reuben because they are so damn great."}, {"review_id": "a_4ZCd_qP-VZDJDofrRLPA", "user_id": "RipqworcT4IZ1irMzt5nAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "This is an affordable, delicious and humble deli that should be visited often.

They do not skip a beat when it comes to service, quality, and culture. Feldman's Deli is authentic Jewish cuisine. It reminds me of a place I tried in NYC but much better.

Beignets are quite awesome if you never had them before, tiny little bagel that were soft and hot when it first came out, and they can be paired with powdered or cinnamon sugar.If you like lox, then you may like Gefilte Fish as a starter, it tasted like minced fish cakes and it is supposed to be a traditional Passover dish too.  Their meat sandwiches make great lunch/dinner meals with loads of meat inside, can't go wrong with Reuben, Brisket, or Pastrami.  I heard Sloppy Joe is good too.Dessert usually consist of a variety of cakes like the seven layered cake or red velvet.  Cheesecake was their best of all, they came out a bit cold, so let it sit for a bit if you prefer some softness in them. Service in here had been fantastic here, everyone here had been quite friendly.  In additionally, they have routine dinner events like Old Jews telling jokes.  I mean unless you are a Nazi sympathizer, or dress like one, you cannot go wrong at Feldman's."}, {"review_id": "k3etqXJy-sjclAVKrTD6MA", "user_id": "x4PHqUMupN9EJ7no6fF0yQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "So freaking good.
