What they do have in the menu regularly is pretty delicious. The salads are excellent as are the appetizers. My favorite ap is the Vermont bakes goat cheese and my husband likes the sweet and spicy popcorn shrimp. For main meal I enjoy the buttermilk herb fried chicken- super fresh and crispy and juicy chicken and I also love the butternut squash ravioli- sweet and savory. The hubby liked the Steak Diane- perfectly cooked and yummy.The interior of the restaurant is small and there's a small bar. If you're going for a specific date and want a set time they do take reservations and I advise making one. When the weather is nice there's outdoor sitting that's lovely and private b/c it's closed off by fence like walls covered in vines otherwise you'd have a view of the parking lot so it's nice they've created outdoor seating that's pleasant without a parking lot view. Overall inside or out Cotton is an intimate place to eat, typically pretty quite so it works well for a lunch meeting or a date. Drinks here are good too. The cosmos are delicious- they offer a flight of smaller cosmos and the bar is nice and has a calm vibe."}, {"review_id": "q-xR9slrTkU43YYvyqHOlw", "user_id": "HlekQcZG6Wsaa2PVxQIzjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I've been frequenting Cotton for years.

Incredible quality at an even more amazing value.

The crab cake app & fried chicken w/homemade mashed potatoes & broccolini w/extra gravy, always yummy! Best coffee served strong & fresh no matter what time you come in. Excellent herbal tea selection & delicious desserts. My fav...white chocolate & raspberry creme brûlée. There may be more expensive restaurants in the mill district & Manchester, but in my estimation, none will top the experience you'll have at Cotton!

One of the best places in downtown Manchester. A hidden away gem that never disappoints. I make sure I come here every time I'm in NH. I had the steak Diane and it was very good. It came with mashed Yukon gold potatoes and asparagus. Sauce over the steak was yummy. I wiped up every bit of it with my potatoes. The service was excellent, attentive and quick but not hovering.

Figuring out the parking setup can be a little confusing initially so once you're in the lot the best way to describe it is: get as close to the door as possible then look straight ahead and there will be a sign for restaurant guest parking. Do not pay for metered parking. Inside, the atmosphere is relaxed and spacious. It's in the Millyard district and I  think the structure may have been an old factory. The upscale reno gives it a nice past & present vibe. There are also retro posters and MASSIVE bottles of wine and spirits placed throughout. I'm regretting not taking a picture of them bcz they were HUGE! The menu is traditional American comfort fare along with a few fusion dishes. I ordered the jumbo crab cake burger deconstructed, sans bun with a side of broccolini and the chicken Chipotle tacos. I was a tad nervous the crab cake burger would be full of breading with little crab, I was wrong. It was a perfect balance and the spicy mayo complimented it well. I, thoroughly, enjoyed every bite. Wasn't too thrilled with the tacos and felt they could have been a little spicier, nothing a little Sriracha couldn't fix. Lastly, the teas are great! He had the rhubarb and I opted for white peach. We simultaneously made the \"ummmmm\" sound and said \"try mine!\" with an embarrassing amount of enthusiasm. Not too strong. Not sickeningly sweet. A perfect balance! Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience but next time I'd like to try something a little more challenging."}, {"review_id": "Vl_KB085TZEpN4kxF4ZiBQ", "user_id": "NCqcGbjEDsuPE_jPzldGPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Wedge salad is wonderful.

Our waitress was energetic but left us to enjoy the conversation. We had consistent refills of water and offers for additional beverages. Our food was to die for - I got the lamb special and it was a bit over cooked but hardly noticeable. Two other members of my party got the Steak Diane and took leftovers home (the portion was amazing!). A fourth member of my part got the lobster ravioli and it looked fantastic. The brownie sundae and cheesecake were good but nothing compared to the dinners. I can't give. Full five stars due to the elongated wait time for our 8pm reservation, we arrived on time (5 mins early) but weren't sat until 8:15-8:25 and our meals took at least 30 mins to come out."}, {"review_id": "Ov-a9C343SK7MjLPUT2v_w", "user_id": "PzebUOVaA0DJtm_TKVTXEQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "This is a great restaurant down by the river in one of the old mill warehouses.

My search is over. Cotton features a whimsical menu that aims to bring out your inner child, featuring items like the popcorn shrimp(in an actual popcorn movie box). Ironically, the restaurant seems to attract an 'older' crowd. Go figure. But I'm here for the food, and it sure didn't disappoint. I Started with the cucumber mint lemonade which was very refreshing. Usually these kinds of drinks are watered down and worth skipping altogether. This version packs the right amount of flavor. Hopefully it is not a seasonal item. - The crab cake appetizer is as authentic and enjoyable as any I've had in Maryland. Great crust, great salsa to compliment. - The fried chicken is a must. Kudos to the courteous waiter for steering me in that direction. I am not usually a fan of chicken breast but this is all kinds of juiciness. The breading is absolute perfection, while the gravy makes and already great piece of meat transform into something flawless.Cotton, how have you eluded me?!"}, {"review_id": "RHgG5LUYjDFfsJooZERncw", "user_id": "XlY6osbMTv_ETNKRVIYCoQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Meh.

I sat at the bar and had two glasses of Hob Nob Pino Noir. I ordered the jumbo sea scallop entree. It came with six grilled scallops and a interesting hash. The hash consisted of sweet potato, corn, and bacon bits with a chipotle aioli. Wasn't exactly what I was expecting but it was tasty. It had a spicy sort of Louisiana Creole feel to it. Overall I was satisfied (clean plate club) like I generally am when I visit Cotton. The bartender Dwayne I believe his name was, was very busy and still managed to keep everyone happy.

This may be located in the mills area but boy is it pretty nice to dine at. They have guest parking you just have to park to the left side of the restaurant. Haven't gone here in the summer to sit outside but the ambiance inside is overall great during the other seasons. Sat at the bar a few times since the rest of the dinner area was already full. The bar tenders are tentative and friendly making sure you're ok and topped off with drinks. The appetizers pairs well with their drinks. Their entrees are decently price for the amount they give as well! The presentation of the food is Instagram friendly  I recommend the popcorn shrimp  They're also on NH restaurant week, just need to ask for the menu when it's that time of year."}, {"review_id": "dhaXEBBMohBEKxa8aMT0qw", "user_id": "3JMbPYm9jOXCvp5juRR4uQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "Nestled in a old mill building Cotton has a nice a atmosphere .
