The food is original and eclectic, making this one of the best places to take people who are willing to try a bit of everything. If you haven't been to a tapas place before, basically everything is to share and you order about 2 dishes per person. I would say that 4 people is the optimal amount for a table, as you get to try most things, but still have enough in each dish for everyone to try some. I've tried the octopus with potato salad, lamb rack, salad with quail, curry, and aracini with meatball. Everything was delicious. I definitely recommend making a reservation, as they can get really busy. Charming date night location... I think some nights they might have dancing but not sure."}, {"review_id": "Phtjdrk3poasdb1wM32XWA", "user_id": "KR5Ma7JrkiqMO9_vLrU9sw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "I finally fulfilled a wishlist item when I got to check out Tapas 177! It was a Saturday night around 8pm and there was an hour wait for the dining area so my friend and I headed over to the bar (which was also packed) Their bar area is super tiny, so you'll be lucky to find a seat on the weekends. We somehow snagged one though, so lucky! You have access to the full food and drink menu at the bar, so that was awesome. The bar tender was friendly and efficient so good service.For drinks I got the make-out and for food I got the octopus. The drink tasted great at first, but as I got more into, it turned into a bitter and more cough syrupy flavor. I finished it but I wouldn't get it again. The octopus dish was pretty ok. The octopus was cooked well, no chewiness or weird fishy flavor so I appreciated that. It came on a bed of mashed potatoes and apparently had bacon on it. The potatoes needed more cooking I think. I get that the style wasn't a smooth mash but the texture wasn't as soft as I think it should be. It also had a semi-strange tangy-ness to it. I didn't taste any of the bacon either, maybe I imagined it on the menu but it wasn't really there?At any rate, I think I'll be coming back to try their other dishes since they have so many flavors to offer. And their drink menu is pretty big too and I love how the bar table is big enough for you to enjoy a nice dinner."}, {"review_id": "SoSxIFeQyB9xrJ9x6c3AbA", "user_id": "ehb7SPb41mD31zrU8_3zkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "I've been to Tapas many times for their awesome Latin nights. For Valentine's Day this year, I tried the food for the first time ever. It was ok. I got the vegan pizza. For the price, it was quite small. I was not full at all. The taste wasn't all that good either. It was bland and not memorable. Tapas is definitely for the more fancier crowd. I'm just not into that. However, service has always been great here and I've never had an issue with the drinks. Also, the vibe is great. Dim lighting, full bars on both floors, diverse crowd. I probably won't eat here again, but I'll continue enjoying the Latin nights!"}, {"review_id": "gsc2xVO_e5eiJ2NumJ1b7Q", "user_id": "Iq45ecHoc6tAD8mZObrNhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Another great evening full of awesome food and beverages with a large group of friends.

Plus I LOVE how they have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options on their menu. The bar area is so spacious and has this great artwork all over, but the main dining area is downstairs. The decor was intimate and bohemian with low lighting; it's PERFECT for a date night. The prices are okay, and the idea of the place is to get a few plates to share which is a fun way to try a couple things."}, {"review_id": "wViG3xgExIaFu7qHa8FOyA", "user_id": "L1EoQDfa4AlzGm3qj2qihQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "We had 8pm reservations.

They must have changed the lighting a but since I was there last because it was much more inviting! We were seated immediately and ordered drinks. I got the sangria and my friends got specialty cocktails. The sangria was good but the \"Poncha\" was out of this world! So yummy. We ordered several tapas, including the fried calamari, the meatball & arancini, the scallops, the cream cheese/mushroom wontons, and the tuna tartar. The scallops and fried calamari we amazing! Highly recommend. The only thing that left me wanting more was the tuna tartar, I wish it had some sort of sauce or more avocado. Overall, a very enjoyable meal with great service!

It's safe to say this review has been coming for a while but I'm glad I am reviewing it after eating there for a second time as it was by far my best experience.The upstairs bar is nice. It's often packed during happy hours, and especially Friday which I think is the busiest time. However packed it might be, you'll always be able to find a spot to hang out (whether it be inside or outside), friendly staff and an amazing drink list. The specials are fantastic as well. What you might not see just by looking from outside is that downstairs they have tabled seating for what can only be described as a dining experience. Tapas is true to its name by offering a tapas style menu ranging from a duo of meatballs and aracini to idli pancakes (and a smattering of seafood options in between). The entree's are fantastic too but I can't rave enough about the tapas menu options. This last time we went, we opted for a few different dishes - Grilled Octopus, Flash fried calimari, the Meatball and Aracini duo, Portobello cream cheese wontons, and Idli Pancakes. All were amazing, and I would try each one again.All in all, Tapas is a great establishment and I enjoy it every time I'm there."}, {"review_id": "2ekayHJoJmT9jgl0TbOoyQ", "user_id": "LfKnuPP_ysF-kMmAo-MPYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Recently went to this bar for the first time and absolutely loved it!

So my mom and I decided to go for drinks and a bite to eat. We came in on a Sunday evening around 5pm when they opened. We opted to sit on the outdoor patio since it was a warm summer evening. The patio has a great ambiance for summertime dining! We took a glance at the drink menu and decided on our drinks. My mom had the mojito and I had a coconut caipirinha. Our sever was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive. Both of the drinks were very strong and tasty. For food we ordered the crab cakes and calamari. Both were incredibly delicious and flavorful. We ordered a couple more rounds of drinks (I switched to the Make Out which was also a very good drink)  before deciding to order the chips and guacamole. The guacamole was the best seasoned and creamiest guacamole I'd had in a long time. After having such a great time out on the patio it started to rain so we took the party to the upstairs bar. Adair was the bartender that evening and he was also incredibly attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at Tapas 177. We also learned that they have different specials during the week such as a ladies night on Wednesdays and free salsa lessons on Thursdays. I definitely recommend Tapas to others who are looking for a fun experience in downtown Rochester. I know I'll definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "xoM0ZjN5OWpc6fHwlbAphg", "user_id": "L4rb4ws2O0s5Dg2ovy6gSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Our first experience was amazing!

These random thoughts came to my head as I sat up on the bar while watching the slinging of the drinks, and the smelling the nice aromas coming from the kitchen path near me. I haven't stepped into this place for a few years, and it's nice to see it grow and change to such an exquisite level. But does the food reflect the amazing atmosphere and service? Well...I ordered 3 different small plates to try out and a cocktail. My experience was as follows:Bulgogi: Small plate with beef, pickled veggies, and sesame noodles all separated with a smear of chili sauce on the plate. The beef wasn't super tender and didn't have any flavor, I pretty much dipped each chunk in the chili sauce to eat them. The pickled veggies were decent with a lightly sweet flavor, and the sesame noodles were soft with a nice salty soy-kick. Individually, nothing impressed me. Maybe I was supposed to mix them all together for a different experience? I'm not sure, but I really don't care to give it another shot.Chicken Tikka Masala: Very heavy on the tomato essence in the sauce, little on the spice, and the chicken was pretty dry. Overall it was like eating red sauce with Indian curry infused. Not a fan.Mushroom Risotto: Very bold and savory flavor from the sauce, despite being a little too salty. Plenty of chewy mushrooms are in there mixed with that rice. It was pretty decent and made me wish the portion size was a tee-bit larger.Angry Rita Cocktail: Not sweet, but tart with a very nice spicy kick. Muy bueno. Interesting drink for sure!This is where I'm torn: nothing really impressed me food-wise. Not that the dishes needed to blow anything out of the water, but there was nothing I ate that would order again. I like trying small plates, but perhaps the numerous diverse food selections the quality gets stretched thin. The service was great and it's definitely a nice spot on St. Paul to indulge on some drinks, but I think that's as far as it will go with me."}, {"review_id": "GphrEpU7U62TzeQuVaclsg", "user_id": "sKj0zaiDH_hV3FGQYDc7VA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "Bulgogi was very delicious.  The noodles and Cole slaw are an excellent accompaniment"}, {"review_id": "54f_aYaUEyjwGILVBk0bNw", "user_id": "jk4E-QP7NhJgWnqoyq5l7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "I love this place.
