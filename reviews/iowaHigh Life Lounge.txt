The latter is a fancy/fun craft beer ball with like 1,000 beers to choose from. High Life has fried chicken and old man beer. Bait Shop has a bait shop/dock theme. High Life is all about High Life beer and being a good-ass dive bar.And they both compliment one other perfectly. Each trip to DSM, I'll stop by for a couple cold ones.Apparently they used to only serve cheap-o beers here like High Life, Hamm's, etc. But you'll now find a few craft favorites alongside the classics. All-in-all a great spot!"}, {"review_id": "AA5s-kEMXbAR7D_h4jRV0w", "user_id": "N0ydXxy_Bw85FmCIIqFpGA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "We were led to believe this space was some sort of hipster, retro dive bar, with great food and 70's iconic beers. What we found was an authentic dive bar, with so-so food, a lot of filth, and 70's beer.I have made a living driving past these types of places and not giving them a second glance Ok, it's a hobby, not an income provider, but still. Now, before you call me a bar snob, I know these establishments have their place, and I love me a cold mug of Schlitz in a small town lounge on a Saturday night, in a place just this. But when we are told it is a destination, a must-go-to place, I expect they will at least occasionally vacuum the carpet.I had the goulash with a side of mac and cheese. What I got was macaroni hot dish with two slices of cheese on top and what became a bowl of redundant mac and cheese. Really, our server couldn't have at least raised an eyebrow? Ok, for all my non-Hungarian, born in the Midwest friends, goulash is supposed to be a beef and veggie stew, often with a peppery tomato base. Honestly, I completely forgot about my church potluck days when everyone brought a dish to pass; many called goulash. To be honest, it wasn't bad. It really did taste of United Methodist fellowship halls and I kind of missed not having a Knox blox to bounce off the wall afterward (any knowing smiles from that one?). And the Schlitz was also as remembered ( not from church!), cold, bitter, and thin - like my date to the senior prom. I guess this was a nostalgic place for me, and perhaps if it had been clean and some effort put into the menu, I could see it being a fun place to pop into. As it stands now though, it is a sad reminder of some of the things I didn't really enjoy growing up."}, {"review_id": "A488DVtULh9Ee9x4Hc-iNw", "user_id": "UtcwxkpWZ-O_LqE9HeS1nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "The CHAMPAGNE OF BARS.  Exactly what a neighborhood bar should be - cozy and very reasonably priced. Dinner tab for the evening $28 bucks including a few drinks (Ketel One up, two beers and an entrée)... outrageously well priced given the quality of the food. If you have never been here, don't bother trying anything else - get the BROASTED CHICKEN. Its ridiculous. They get the inside juicy and extremely crispy on the outside without being over greasy - perfection. Cooked with a patented pressure-frying process that produces the best chicken you'll ever have. Comes with two sides (I went Mashed Potatoes & Gravy / Refried Beans) and a roll (even the roll was ridiculous yum). Tator Tots, Chili Cheese Fries, Mac & Cheese Potato Salad with Bacon sides all looked temping as well. Check it out - you will love it. Adam the bartender was great too!"}, {"review_id": "cTs0Nb-KnZ1v4g9O9ntI6Q", "user_id": "9ojE-trVdE3qySbW8a_pBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "How have I not ever written a review for one of our favorite DSM locations?! We love Highlife Lounge. The place is a dive that hasn't been touched since the 1970s; it's perfect. In the last few years, they did update their box TVs to flatscreens and they do allow beers after the 1970s now, much to my dismay, but in keeping up with the times, I don't mind craft beers on tap. Get the bacon wrapped jalapeño tater tots appetizer. I crave those things. They are so delicious!! This time, I had a pork tenderloin with sweet potato fries. I devoured the pork tenderloin and would recommend. I think next time, I'll just stick with regular tater tots. The sweet potato fries weren't worth the $3 upgrade. My husband had a spam and eggs sandwich served on Texas toast. He's still talking about how amazing it was three days later. We love this bar--shag carpet and all! We would highly recommend it."}, {"review_id": "Ta01ZoFPqCQZ5t0iJZVfmg", "user_id": "QBZXXXFXB9vzAt4lNduQqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "Divey. Rustic. Cheap. DeliciousHigh Life Lounge has that divey 80's vibe to it. You can get pretty much any divey old school beer that you want. This is one of the well known gems in Des Moines. Nothing beats a cold PBR and a burger basket. Except for maybe their bacon wrapped tots. Oh and their spam grilled cheese. If you haven't had a chance to try the spam grilled cheese, put that on your to-do list.

Also patrons were friendly, a mix of locals and business travelers like myself.  This place is connected to another bar-The Bait Shop, same kitchen, they have tons of beer on tap there.  What a gem this place is, I hope for more frequent trips to Des Moines!"}, {"review_id": "hyPXgT-uDDYClx1tkyIj7g", "user_id": "UYwf-LvQv6KEc79vWkl1aw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "In Des Moines for a few days. Weather is super cold here but I am totally blessed that this restaurant was less than 1/2 a block from my hotel. If this place was next to my house I would eat here every night. Ive had several meals here and each one was AMAZING! You could tell they use quality ingredients and everything is made from scratch. The broasted chicken was insane! Loved it so much I ordered more the next evening. Had a club salad and corn chowder for lunch. Friggen phenomenal! Less than the crappy microwaved meatloaf I got up the street from Hessen Haus and x5 more filling not to mention both had to have been made fresh from scratch.

This dive does some things well and other horribly. I ordered the fried chicken, which was moist and fresh out of the fryer. (I  would have seasoned it a little more, but it was fine.) The chili cheese fries were fine, although the chili wasn't particularly flavorful and the fries were clearly frozen rather than fresh. The Mexican rice, on the other hand, was almost inedible. It was completely flavorless, except for perhaps a slight tang of chicken stock. I wouldn't object to grabbing a beer or some chicken here, but I bet you could find more consistently good food elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "Z9mL9989ETehJMEggbzufg", "user_id": "JDlr4nRRlbpQ6zsDAO2Spg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Chicken was OFF the dang chain!!!  Absolutely delicious!!!  Omg!!  I will def be back!!!!  Great service!!

The chicken is very good, as are their rolls. If you love things covered in bacon, make sure to try the tator tots or little smokeys. The most recent time I was here, I got their version of a morning burger (with an egg) and sweet potato fries. The burger was very good, while the fries were lackluster. My husband got the garlic burger, and it was honestly too much garlic. This is coming from a woman who puts garlic and garlic powder in and on EVERYTHING. The garlic is so overpowering it almost burns your tongue. I also had an iced tea that was not very good either. It tasted a little musty and old.Overall though, I enjoy this restaurant. The 70s feel to it is unique, and not too overdone.

I came back the next day. As a 50-year-old man, this bar reminded me so much of the bars my dad used to hang out in when I was growing up.  Every piece of this bar had a nostalgic memory for me. Growing up my dad drink Falstaff Beer and wouldn't you know they had a beer sign on the wall. Putting the nostalgia on the side, the beer selection is fun in the food is very good. I had left my glasses in the hotel room so the gentleman sitting at the bar next to me suggested the chicken pot pie. What was delivered was far from what I expected. One of the flakiest pastries surrounding a nice mix of vegetables and chicken.I also tried an order of the tater tot's wrapped in bacon. Careful, they come out very hot.

There are a lot of things on the menu I look forward to trying some time tonight I had the Bacon Wrapped Little Smokies and onion rings. The onion rings were nice and thin and crispy done perfectly the Bacon Wrapped Little Smokies we're great! On the menu it says that there's some cayenne on them and I was afraid it would be hot because I don't do spicy food but to my surprise it was not hot at all! The bacon wrapped tater tots have a little piece of Jalapeno in there too and you can't order them without the jalapeno but it is fairly easy to pull the jalapeno out if you remember to do it. I'm not a big fan of bars because they're normally noisy and this place is noisy but the food was well worth it. I don't think though I will get my family to go there because it would be too noisy for them fortunately it is on my way home so I can always call ahead and stop and pick it up"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/high-life-lounge-des-moines-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
