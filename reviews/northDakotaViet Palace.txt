Our 3rd visit since moving to Fargo. The selection was really nice but we keep on going back for the Pho. The servings are as big as they are delicious. We have tried some of their other dishes which are also really good. There was only one server but she kept up with all the orders and was very pleasant. Good to see Fargo has such a huge variety options including this gem."}, {"review_id": "7clpgYOhtHyYJSWNzG_M6A", "user_id": "Cyng8a7LsvXZdWk7bYrr9Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "This was my first time at Viet Palace. I stopped in at 1230 for lunch. The building is easy to find and the interior is very well maintained. The service was fast and friendly. I had the wonton soup to begin my lunch and it was amazing. Full of flavor and the dumplings were delicious. I was in the fence about the entree. I was considering the pho with rice noodles or the beef with mixed vegetables. I decided the beef with mixed vegetables. It came out fast with a brown soupy sauce on it. The vegetables and beef were awesome but the sauce had a slimy texture with no flavor at all. There was a few sprinkles of cracked pepper on top but I was surprised at how flavorless this dish was. Overall, stick with the soup I think on my next visit."}, {"review_id": "02dXhmu4V-_6RxbbNHQK1Q", "user_id": "pTeXu4zmGCx1Sf9S5F0ILA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I was in fargo on business and had a hankering for pho. Considering this was the only place I could find in town I came here.  Based on the food alone I would have given it 2 stars. I had the beef pho and pork bahn mi. The fact that I couldn't smell any food when I walked in kinda turned me off. The atmosphere was dead. Dead quiet, no music and a little awkward.  I was not greeted and I seated myself. Only a few diners. I was shortly approached by the waitress who was extremely friendly. She was working very hard and was pleasant the whole time. Service was slow but I wasnt in a hurry. My pho was very greasy and my sandwich very bland but I was starving so I ate what I could. I'm giving this place 4 stars based on the waitress alone. She worked hard and stayed moving quickly. I've had pho all across the states so although I was disappointed in the pho it may be because I've had some of the best and those places will be hard to beat. The sign said they were hiring so I'm sure they're trying to improve their service but if you are looking for authentic delicious taste you might look elsewhere. Also it was pretty expensive. My soup was almost ten dollars for basic beef and meatballs. If you want a quiet place to fill your belly try this place out."}, {"review_id": "KfeEeQ3czIX49HG6FvRCzA", "user_id": "stBIMIyqREnUzDQvRSgScw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/19/2017", "text": "This may be slightly biased considering I come from a city with lots of Vietnamese options. We were working in Grand Forks and made a trip down to Fargo for some Vietnamese food and a trip to Costco.This place is pretty large with a picture of the Great Wall on one of the walls. Apparently it was a chinese restaurant prior and am guessing it was a buffet.The sign outside says it is the best Pho in town. I am not sure if there is another true Vietnamese restaurant in town so that sign holds true. I ordered seafood with flat rice noodles..the noodles were crunchy and dried out. I struggled to eat them, but fortunately they started absorbing some of the sauce and became a little more edible. I asked for it to be super spicy, but they forgot. They took it back and added red crushed peppers on it. The alternate choice was seafood rice noodle soup for $11.95. They charged $16.95? When I asked, she said seafood is expensive? How was the seafood noodle soup $5 cheaper? My coworker ordered Pho and it did look authentic. I asked how it was, and he said jokingly, the best in Fargo. He is Vietnamese and it was his 1st time in Fargo. My other coworker ordered chicken fried rice and it was a lot of food, but didn't express the taste."}, {"review_id": "98ySDtP4GEyArVrqlL_MHQ", "user_id": "RPVOUnj-p7bRHY1gcX39Fg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2017", "text": "Another review from a few weeks ago.We were in the mood for some Chinese food, and decided to check this place out instead. The positive reviews on Yelp brought us here. The ambience leaves much to be desired. This place was once a Chinese buffet, and not much has gone in to the interior since the change.Staff is very friendly and courteous. Unlike most other patrons, we did not go for the Pho. The missus ordered some curry tofu and I settled for the lemongrass chicken. We started out with the fresh spring rolls served with a nice peanut sauce. Tasty!Food took a little longer than anticipated. People who came in after us received their orders before we did. Maybe cause they all had Pho? Who knows.When the food did eventually arrive, we were not disappointed. Level of spice and flavor was just amazing. Serving size was large and there were plenty of leftovers. Of course the aroma from the leftovers made a few mouths water at the office the next day. We will definitely return."}, {"review_id": "xS4978XXhDEf9hFjit3Bzw", "user_id": "ZSjY-KnhbhIR9by694HZKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Excellent in every way!

I had serious doubts about a Vietnamese restaurant in Fargo, but wow-am I so happy that we tried it. I absolutely love the egg noodle wonton soup. Having lived in so many major areas of the country, it's so difficult to find a good bowl of Vietnamese wonton soup. Many places take cheap short cuts to make a quick buck. This place takes the time to do it right. The broth and ingredients are incredible.When we walked into the restaurant, the air smelled of delicious broth. My hubby had the pho, and it was also amazing! It's obvious, This place makes awesome soups. We also had their spring rolls for an appetizer and it was fresh and delicious. They even did the sauce right. Too many other places make crappy peanut sauce, buts it's yummy here! I had their fresh coconut drink and it was served as a fresh coconut. So good! We got their pork and beef banh mi's to go. Looking forward to trying after leaving so full.Do yourself a favor, and try this fantastic Vietnamese restaurant in Fargo!"}, {"review_id": "cYE4uemtcBkoPAlXYDQ-ww", "user_id": "XvRrdywhK1b6nlOtJcfErQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "I ordered the Chicken Curry.

Wonton soup is okay. A little over priced for a semi okay dish. Eggs rolls were okay. Not my favorite. I've had better other places. Guy with the Lexus gold necklace who works there. That is not a thing and women don't find that sexy to look at please pick a different necklace to wear to work. Service was okay. Smells good inside. But not totally thrilled and over the moon. I prob won't subject myself to eating here again. It was good because I was on my period and willing to eat anything. Prob better if i order take out next time."}, {"review_id": "ab0XES3zEQfHiagNYXQyuQ", "user_id": "ulxfwPZrbBBbEGNWVf_KJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "This is the one of my favorite Ethnic restaurant in town!

I found it to be just OK. Here's why:The restaurant was spacious, with a strange vibe. I just never felt comfortable there for some reason. It would be easy to navigate with a wheelchair or other asistive device. I liked that the menu had a manageable number of selections - not overwhelming at all.I must admit I am not a fan of pho at all, so ordered my benchmark dish: vermicelli bowl with grilled pork. This dish was $8.95. They had only 3 other vermicelli salad selections, ranging in price from $8.95-$11.95. Overall, it was underwhelming. There was a moderate amount of pork which was tender with a good flavor. The vermicelli arrived warm - very strange, since it is usually chilled. The 'salad' of shredded lettuce was crisp, but contained a large amount of cilantro - again strange. Usually comes with mint or basil. The carrot and daikon were shredded fine and very crisp, but little flavor. The most disappointing for me was their fish sauce: it was one dimensional, very tart and tasted mostly of vinegar. It had no discernable fish flavor, no sweetness, a few red pepper flakes for heat. Really lackluster and added nothing to the dish. I ended up putting hoisin sauce on the food for some flavor.Service was slow, and the servers seemed to rush around, harried. The bathroom was clean but the soap dispenser was broken. So they had a small dish of liquid soap to dip into for hand washing. Yuk. Ample parking in the lot out front.Overall, glad to try this place but would not return."}, {"review_id": "agt9CYKMCDztUw09pJYALA", "user_id": "qqgkzfoZWVIhoahsUcGvMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2016", "text": "My wife and I get a lot of takeout in Fargo, and Viet Palace has quickly become one of our favorites.My absolute favorite dish is the tofu vegetable pho. The broth is delightfully rich in flavor but still light and has a perfect balance of spices with strong clove and light anise notes. There are plenty of veggies and the tofu and noodles take up the flavor of the broth. I could eat it every day.The vegetable or shrimp fried rice is my wife's favorite. The rice is well seasoned so it doesn't taste like plain rice, but isn't overly salty and drowned in soy sauce like some places. It almost tastes sweet.I also tried a couple of the cold vermicelli salads and I really liked one, but the pork in the other wasn't to my taste, so I'm hesitant to recommend for or against then at this point.I can't speak for dining in because we've never done it, but if you're looking for excellent takeout, check out Viet Palace."}, {"review_id": "MLXH7gI09jMoooGWEPG7RA", "user_id": "-HEw3HGqO12jfcqXboySFw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2017", "text": "I live in Bismarck, and make sure to eat here every time I make a trip to Fargo.
