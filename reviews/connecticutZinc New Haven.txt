Zinc is located on Chapel St in New Haven, where parking spaces are few and parallel parking is required. Luckily, Zinc provides a voucher for parking in either the Temple Street Garage or Crown Street Garage. I recommend the Crown Street Garage as it is closer to the restaurant.The vibe of the restaurant was upscale, though most of the people eating there were dressed in casual clothing. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive throughout the meal, filling our water glasses frequently and clearing plates in a timely fashion. In terms of food, Zinc could best be described as American with an Asian twist, or perhaps Pan-Asian with American flare. Their menu seemed to have a dish from each major country in Asia (Indian saag paneer, Korean bulgogi, Vietnamese grilled chicken etc.)We enjoyed their complimentary flat cake fennel bread with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce, which was a nice change from the usual bread and olive oil of most restaurants. We ordered the duck nachos to share as an appetizer and it was excellent; savory chunks of duck and microgreens over fried wonton wrappers with a drizzled aioli. I was worried that I would be filled by the nachos, but they were delightfully light and flavorful. For entrees, I ordered the sea bass and butternut squash mash. I was a little concerned because the fish came out smelling a little fishy, but it didn't affect the flavor. The bass was cooked to a good consistency (not hard or rubbery) and the mash was smooth and buttery. The carrot broth and lime coconut broth with the diced brussel sprouts and the occasional chunk of Asian pear made for a nice pairing. The rest of my family was equally happy with their food, which included the duck bulgogi, hanger steak, and grilled chicken with a Vietnamese twist. I tried tidbits of all the meat, and each one was well seasoned and cooked to the right degree. My family tends to eat a lot, but even we were stuffed after our entrees, as they were quite generous. Because I had indicated on the OpenTable reservation that we were there for a special occasion, Zinc brought out a complimentary chocolate, peanut butter, and banana tart to share. Like the rest of the meal, we enjoyed it very much. At this point, we were about to burst!All in all, Zinc was the perfect restaurant to celebrate a special occasion. Excellent food, sizable portions, convenient parking, and an attentive staff made for a great experience."}, {"review_id": "xVXH9ij5avErTNjdTMEW0A", "user_id": "0POkdYpw2Bnda-pWxqBgUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "I hadn't been here in a while so when I was back in New Haven for dinner I made sure we tried this place again. A very bland inside would make you think this place lacked creativity; that is clearly not the case when you see the menu of Asian influence on a New American restaurant. For the table we started with the dumplings, which were in a delicious spicy sauce. They also gave some bread with a DELICIOUS spicy dipping sauce. 5/5 for both of those. For entrees we got the sea bass over a bed of pears and butternut squash which was to die for. We also got the daily special pork osso bucco ramen, which was a big miss. The broth was not very flavorful and thin, which was a surprise. The final entree was the duck bulgogi rice bowl, which was another homerun.I was very disappointed with the dessert however. We got the chocolate, peanut butter, banana tart. The mousse on it was delicious, but it was really missing any sort of crunch. It was just soft gelato mixed with soft foam with no crunch to tie it together. In the end, it is hard to be too disappointed with the meal, but the two lacking dishes really surprised me given the reviews and my past experiences here."}, {"review_id": "RZSqbn9AQGReEss_ngRtnw", "user_id": "K0FyQY_DDvpYujdOZnfIjQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Updated review: I had a feeling they tossed my leftovers. I had to ask two different people for them. I opened what I thought was artichokes this morning to add them to my breakfast and someone else's leftovers were in the box. Very gross!!Duck nachos are fantastic. Custom drinks strong and tasty.  I eat at a lot of high end restaurants. The food meets the level. It was very good. The service was off from the hostess to the server. The male host was pretty good and took my check when my server was not around."}, {"review_id": "yGISCxXxo9M3s_p2MV82yA", "user_id": "5UOmwBYQls3zrwc6FKYdPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "It was our first time to Zinc. We were travelling to a Spa in Norwich from Greenwich and stopped for dinner. We were seated at a perfect corner booth for two that provided a great view of tbe bar area. Our server was top notch. Cocktails were spot on. We ordered two appetizers and one entree to share. We had pork belly and duck nachos. Both were quite good. We shared the stripped bass. It was in a delicious broth with succulent muscles. I look forward to returning when in Hartford."}, {"review_id": "oFashlAaOPFsxtljupe4Bg", "user_id": "Mw9jklpJ-fM-7CP3u9XHMQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "A friend and I went to Zinc for restaurant week, and did not enjoy it very much. The service is excellent and friendly, but that was one of the only saving graces of the restaurant, along with the decor. We ordered some sort of duck salad and pork adobo for our entrees. Both dishes were salty, although they had the potential to be great dishes if it weren't for the over-salting. The pork adobo was well-spiced, but the salt just didn't let the flavors shine through. At the least, more rice and lettuce wraps could have been provided considering how much (salty) pork was on the plate. Also, the restaurant week menu online included dessert for the prix-fixe lunch, but we were dismayed to find out that this was not the case once we had finished our entrees. Overall, not a great place for restaurant week, and the chefs could work on balance in their dishes."}, {"review_id": "Y_AB5BjKn2jsUWoxasx_ow", "user_id": "FLO8kHBw4Pe4ttFdsJ0yIA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is a very popular place and it is good, but New Haven has several better.  The menu is rather limited.  Some items are excellent, others competent but not very imaginative.  Nothing especially memorable.  Noisy with distracting music.One thing did bother me, as it reflected a bad attitude on the part of our wine server (our waitress was excellent).  Two people at our table of four had the same wine by the glass, served from those mini carafes that don't let you see what you may really be getting.  My wife's glass was slightly but noticeably short-poured, I'm sure not on purpose, but regardless.  I placed her glass next to the other person's and very quietly mentioned this to the wine server.  His response was to rudely and dramatically dump the last couple of drops from each of the two similar mini carafes into my wife's glass, clearly annoyed and clearly trying to embarrass me.  I let it go but at almost $15 for a relatively small pour, this was not OK, and the server should have immediately made it right.Overall a not unenjoyable evening, but one can do better in this city of many truly fine restaurants."}, {"review_id": "nG9f6KfqjSKf5g4vooN25Q", "user_id": "CSVBWd3SOKMpFQcpgvCpWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "I've lived in New Haven for 8 years, and tried all there is to try food-wise, and this is my favorite restaurant in town. Every time I've ever been to Zinc, I've tried something different and have loved every dish that I've had. As a student, it's on the pricier side for me, but lunch here can be a pretty good deal depending on what you order. Food: 5/5 - I've had the pork chops, steak, smoked salmon sandwich, among others. Everything has been delicious and perfectly cooked.Service: 5/5 - it's the type of place where the staff folds your napkin when you go to the bathroom and consistently cleans your crumbs off the table.Ambience: 5/5 - it's upscale, not too loud, overall clean and appropriate decor. It's a bit small but not to the point of feeling cramped.

The restaurant is spacious and very modern. I've gotten the pork chop and the hanger steak. The pork chop was quite good (though way too much food when combined with the sides) and had a delightful pomegranate sauce. The hanger steak was serviceable.

We were seated quickly and had a friendly waitress to take our order. We ended up ordering both the pork belly and the smoked duck breast nachos. The pork belly was as juicy as a pork belly could be and was absolutely delicious. The nachos were crispy, crunchy, and some of the best nachos I've had in the New Haven area.

If you haven't been to zinc you're missing out. For lunch the Cobb Salad is the best in its class. I've never had one better than Chef Denise Appel's twist on this classic salad. Their flat bread and sambal offering is addicting. I could literally drink the sambal, it's that good. Everything on the menu is passionately crafted and delicious. They have an excellent wine program and it's the perfect spot for an event, meeting, or date. You can book reservations on Open Table ahead of time. It's walking distance from all that downtown has to offer, theater, cinema, night life and there is plenty of parking in the garage behind the restaurant.

Creative, dynamic, excellent wine selections and food that was outright Michelin Star level.That said the last time I've been here was 6 years ago. A memorable dinner with my friend, my girlfriend, and his not-yet-fiancee. Our waiter John was fantabulous. Not overbearing, not fake, and not trying to just \"upsell.\"The food was great, the wine pairings were right on point from the Trimbach Rieslig to the Campo Viejo Rioja. The service amazing.Unfortunately only two of three remain in place today.My first general complaint  is that Zinc has become overpriced. The quality of the food has also dropped somewhat.The once amazing duck nachos barely have any duck on them and instead drown in various aioli, craime fraishe, and micro greens.Steak Frites was a decent size. However the chard lettuce is so bitter on its own and the Bleu cheese did not manage to translate into a cohesive flavor punch even with the sauce. It all just fizzled.The highlights of this evening were the cheese plate and to some extent the DanDan Mian. I've lived in China for a while and frequent Cafe China in NYC so I have a vague idea of what this dish should be. It wasn't quite as \"sesamy\" as I am used to and I think the pork may have been frozen. However nice touch with the duck. It needs a bit more spice and a bit more sesame paste.The cheeses were great but some Cherry jam would be appreciated versus the 5 random blueberries and raisins on top of raisin toast. Almonds or sweetened walnuts perhaps?And charging 14 dollars for cocktails in New Haven? Really?Service is the strong side here. The bartender was curteous, prompt, and open to making non-upsale suggestions which I always appreciate. Didn't bother with standard banter and focused on delivering. I didn't catch his name but in a sense that's also part of professionalism. Not trying to become intimate with a guest too soon. It's vulgar and belongs at TGIFMr Bartender job very well done.Kitchen...please go back to the old Zinc.
