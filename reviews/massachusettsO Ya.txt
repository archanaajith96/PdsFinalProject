They were nice enough to change my reservation when I called in afterwards, so that I'm seated at a table for 2 instead of the bar, since I had a Toddler in tow. Hostess & helpers were warm, friendly and helpful. Ordered the 17-course omakase, such divine & fresh sashimi!! Each bite bursts with flavor, all of them unique. Wish the pieces were larger! The meal went by very fast, they paced the plates just right. The price is $185 pp, but with taxes and mandatory 20% gratuity - your bill is over $235. Expensive!!! Definitely can not afford such a splurge like this again! Our waitress was awesome, patient and respectful.

Having seen this restaurant on Eater before moving to the East Coast, it was definitely near the top of our go-to list. As a celebration, we went with the Grand Tasting Omakase (without the white truffle oil - as much as I love truffle, it doesn't seem necessary), along with 3 extra a la carte items. These are the courses that we had but it is to note that the menu varies slightly online. To note, the nigiri parts of the menu come with one piece per person, and we found the hot food portions to be larger in comparison to the nigiri and sashimi.+KUMAMOTO OYSTER+COBIA+MAINE SEA URCHIN & OSETRA CAVIAR+LOCAL SEA BREAM+LUBINA SEA BASS+JAPANESE AJI+TORO HANDROLL+KYOTO STYLE GOLDEN CHANTERELLE MUSHROOMS+FOIE GRAS+KONA KAMPACHI+KONA ABALONE+SHIMA AJI & SANTA BARBARA SEA URCHIN+ORA KING SALMON+BLUEFIN CHUTORO+BLUEFIN TORO+ALASKAN KING CRAB SUNOMONO+MAIN LOBSTER+CHAWANMUSHI+TRUFFLED KAGOSHIMA A5 WAGYU SEARED PETIT STRIP LOIN+FOIE GRAS NIGIRI+SOMETHING SWEETFor the something sweet, we got a floral sorbet and a homemade chocolate. As for the dishes, the nigiris were tasty and unique! They definitely weren't the \"traditional\" flavors I've had with sushi but it was amazing in its own sense; never thought I would like olives or banana pepper in my sushi! On the other hand, the sashimi, while still tasty, were not as exciting as the nigiri or hot dishes. While still tasty, they didn't blow me away like the others. The hot dishes were delicious but by this point, I was really full, but wish I had more room for these very decadent plates!On top of our omakase, we had 3 extra a la carte items. +UNI TOAST: It uses truffle honey with uni on top of a crispy buttery toast, and just an amazing bite. The honey definitely complements the creaminess of the uni. +HOMEMADE FINGERLING POTATO CHIP: I got this because I absolutely adore potato chips and we got it as a \"let's see what a gourmet potato chip tastes like\" joke. But it was absolutely amazing. There's a sauce that made it kind of creamy and the truffle is fantastic. +FOIE GRAS GYOZA: We're definitely foie gras lovers and this was wonderfully decadent. It was a little on the fatty end but it was definitely balanced out by the cleaner flavors of the nigiri and sashimi that we had. Wonderfully delicious!Honestly, this was too many courses for me, and the grand omakase is already a large amount of food. So if you have smaller appetites, consider doing a la carte. They do give you the menu after the meal and it helps to figure out what you want next time! The service here is also fantastic. Our waiter was very happy and friendly, and the staff takes your jackets before seating. What was a little strange to us was that the nigiri would be made in front of us, a waiter would take it to the back, where it was then brought to us. However, it didn't bother us immensely (we've been to omakases where the chef hands you the sushi). All in all, we loved our experience here, and it was a great celebratory meal! After having the omakase, I would consider picking things from the a la carte menu next time. Though, as a first time visit, the grand omakase gave a great first impression and lets you know what to expect on future visits."}, {"review_id": "B8hsMOaWto7OUXDGVqBvPw", "user_id": "nJRC9BUXSho8BnplaoClBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "A lot of people, myself included, think of Oya as a sushi restaurant. And they do specialize more in sushi that most other dishes. However, during this last visit I realized, as a whole, Oya is really a high class Izakaya. It is also important to recognize the fusion or modern element in the cuisine. Many of the dishes have a modern touch typically not seen in traditional style Japanese cuisine. Although the menu does state that most sushi can be traditionally prepared. Now, there are two options for how to indulge in the menu. One is to have an Omakase the other is to order a la carte. I've done the chef's tasting previously and there are items on the menu I wanted to try that are not included in the tasting, so we decided to order a la carte. Our server recommended that we order around 15 dishes for an la carte experience. Started off with Miso Soup. Strong broth with clean essence of the ocean. Strong Shiitake flavor was nice in combination with miso. Great way to start the meal.Kumamoto oyster is clean tasting. The brine from the oyster is great paired with the watermelon pearls and the cucumber. All the flavors hit you at once in a sweet, salty and refreshing experience. The Bluefin Chutoro, Ora King Salmon, and Hamachi Belly Nigiri are excellent. The fish quality is superb. Soft texture, clean tasting. The fish meat is a pleasure to eat. The rice is properly form and each Nigiri is lightly brushed with a unique sauce and some topped with microgreens. The Chutoro has some marbling and subtle melt in your mouth feeling. Read carefully what seasoning is on the Nigiri/Sashimi, as some of the seasonings such as truffle oil can detract from the experience rather than enhance it. But all the Nigiri I selected this time were winners. The only exception is the Eel Nigiri, as it did not have the delicate texture I'd expect. Perhaps the eel was not the best quality. A Nigiri I would not recommend.As for Sashimi the standouts were Bay Scallops and Ora King Salmon. The scallops were complimented by the truffle slices. The salmon sashimi was topped with cilantro sprouts and has a mix of ginger and sesame oil. Perhaps not the most elegant sashimi, and maybe a little gratuitous in the seasoning, but I enjoyed it. The Hamachi Tartare is a crowd-pleaser and if you mix in the sauce at the bottom you will get a strong, but balanced ginger complexity with some chile oil adding a nice nuance. Next up was the Seared Octopus Soba. Topped with bonito flakes, the delicate noodles are smothered in a rich squid in sauce. Pieces of chewy seared Octopus are coveted if sharing. This is an umami hearty dish that I highly recommend. The tempura was perhaps a weaker aspect of the meal. We ordered both a mushroom and shrimp tempura. The mushroom tempura has the delicate light coating one expects of tempura. The thick sweet sauce drizzled onto was tasty. But, at the same time, there was nothing about this dish that was particularly interesting. Now, the shrimp tempura was on the heavy side, probably because of the bacon emulsion. But also the coating itself seemed too heavy and greasy. Bacon and truffle emulsion coupled with fried shrimp is a bit unbalanced, even gratuitous. Korean Shortrib is topped with microgreens. The rib is extremely tender, (I tore it apart with chopsticks), and fatty to the point that the microgreens do not provide enough balance to this dish. The sweetness of the sauce and the melty fattiness of the rib is something fierce. The meat itself is not sophisticated, I think it may suffer from a lack of flavor, something that the sweet glaze tries to mask.  Overall extremely indulgent. I like this and would order it again, but it may be too unbalanced for some. I love to eat this alongside a bowl of rice. The allure of the Onsen Egg is that it takes 45 minutes to prepare. But this was a weaker aspect of the meal. It is a soft-boiled egg, albeit one expertly cooked. Extremely delicate, the yolk has a perfect amount of coagulation. Dashi stock adds needed complexity. The Foie Gras Sashimi is always given last because it is a perfect way to finish the meal with its sweet and savory nature. An unlikely combination of Foie Gras, rice, seaweed and Cocoa has an incredible balance of sweet, salty, and umami. This is a must try, item. And the sip of Aged Sake is a perfect way to end the meal. The Aged sake is comparable to a port wine. Concentrated, bold yet sweet. I savored each sip. As a dessert, we got Mochi Doughnuts. The mocha was nice and warm, dipped in crunchy sugar, but most of what you taste is the caramel dip, which has a rich buttery quality. I probably would not order this again. Again, it is important to recognize that Oya is a not traditional Japanese fare (unless you request traditionally prepared Nigiri/Sashimi) but Japanese Omakase/Izakaya with a modern/fusion element.  I am not a fan of fusion food. Regardless, Oya provides a a gastronomic experience that I highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "gn7wV6qJAPk5LyhM2d5nMA", "user_id": "xoMAPuCXIW2aViOLS1o4MQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "My fiancé took me here for my Christmas gift, and I have to say.

Wow. Some of the best bites of food I've had. There were so many highlights, I'll try to stick to a few. Uni topped with black caviar was hands down top three bites I've experienced in my foodie existence. Creamy, decadent, buttery, and full of the briny sea flavor you expect from delicious sea urchin. I recently learned that the edible part is the reproductive organ. I feel weird about this, but it wouldn't stop me from eating a tub. The fingerling potato with black truffle. Holy smokes I didn't think a potato chip on sushi would make me swoon, it was definitely the slice of truffle that took this over the edge. Salmon with the soy sauce goo left over at the bottom of a tank. Yummy. I'll take more completely cooked down and gooey soy sauce please. I don't know why there are haters on the egg. That thing was jelly on the outside and cream on the inside. It was yummy. Service was insanely good. You should do the tasting menu.

O Ya is quite the opposite. The quality and source of the seafood is top notch, but they're much more into elaborate presentation, and multiple flavors and ingredients. Well it's certainly worth a try.We decided to order a la carte. The tasting menus are $185-285 before any booze. Unless you're the most indecisive (and it is difficult here with such a big menu) or very unfamiliar with the dishes, many reviewers have said picking your own is the way to go.The dizzing array of dishes we ordered, let me just group them by must-try, a-ok, and pass:Must Try:Softshell crab, sake vinegar aioli, chive flower $27Shrimp tempura, bacon truffle emulsion, scallion ginger oil $18Foie gras gyoza, kyoto sansho, pink peppercorns $18Foie gras, balsamic chocolate kabayaki, Claudio Corallo rain cocoa pulp, sip of aged sake $33Decent:Fried Kumamoto oyster, yuzu kosho aioli, squid ink bubbles $14CA Gold Uni with white sturgeon caviar, pro blanco, $38Warm eel, thai basil, kabayaki, Kyoto sangho $18Hamachi belly, yuzu soy marinated CA sea urchin $22Seared Spanish octopus, squid ink soba, bonito, mentaiko, meyer lemon $21Bluefin toro tartare, ginger kimchee jus $21Pass:Hamachi Nigiri, spicy banana pepper mousse $14Shima aji, Hue style, kaffir oil, table salad $21Ora King Salmon, spicy sesame ponzu, yuzu kasha, scallion oil $18Onsen egg, dash sauce, truffle salt, pickled garlic $12Tea brined fried pork ribs, hot sesame oil, $16I think I see a pattern here. Dishes that should be done up and flavorful, the fried shellfish and the foie gras, were done excellently here and delicious. Most of the sushi was pretty tasty but not spectacular. Most of the sashimi style plates were just too busy and I didn't understand the point of all these little salads on the side (pointless). Their current menu has some more intriguing fishes, but when I went, it seemed like all they served were the popular best hits (salmon, toro, uni, hamachi etc). At a top notch sushi restaurant, I except to the offerings to be much more diverse and my taste experiences to be challenged to try something I have never had before.And in the end, for a fairly equal distribution among excellent to don't-care-for, this place is crazy expensive! To fill up, we ordered 16 dishes between 2 girls. Averaging $15-20 per dish? You can do the math... Every single bite was at least $10. It was still a nice dinner, and if money was no subject to you, then maybe this was a good meal. I do not regret coming here by any means, and had a fun time, but doubt I will ever return."}, {"review_id": "W2oik-04SCczspIwGw7Few", "user_id": "xGXY4S8-lbaHRlJNldTFpQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "We came here for Vday and really enjoyed the full experience from the real estate, quirks, music, and of course the food.

It was not on the menu but I talked to the head chef with a big smile, he obliged. I recall the host ran to me informing that I should not order off the menu, otherwise others may follow suit, and the chef is not fluent in English blabla.. does she realize some people may be able to speak another language?

Taste wise, I was wondering if we landed in trendy fusion restaurant where the chef thinks more soy sauce means taste; definitely not a quality Japanese taste. Based on our experience, I do not understand the praise that O Ya received. It certainly has little to do with Japanese taste. Way too oily, greasy, saucy. I would have been embarrassed had I taken my Japanese clients and colleagues there. May be we just got a bad night so I may go back one day to give them another chance.

As a long time Gossip Girl lover, when I heard O Ya was one of Blake Lively & Ryan Reynold's favorite restaurant, I HAD to add O Ya to my list. On top of that, I LOVE sushi. If I could have sushi every day, I would. Also, their Instagram page showed a picture of a piece of sushi with a potato chip fingerling (which was actually a nice surprise) and I knew I had to try it because I was so intrigued. O Ya is a little higher price range than anything I have ever eaten but I have to say it is truly a dining experience. I thought my boyfriend would never agree to go to O Ya in a million years but he actually agreed to it when one of my girl friends & his fave guys suggested going so we made a reservation for a double date! I HIGHLY recommend making a reservation because they get full often and the restaurant is very small but intimate. I honestly didn't dive into reviews like I usually do because I wanted to be surprised and really enjoy my meal. I went in with no expectations and I really loved our dinner. We got the regular omakase (but I would definitely save and go back for the GRAND omakase one day- ugh can't wait) and that was about $430 per couple  without alcohol. The regular included 17 plates of delicious sushi, sashimi and cooked foods. Each dish was beautiful/detailed and the things they added blended together so tastefully. On top of that we ordered 2 desserts for the table (the donuts with chrysanthemum sugar & a sorbet). The check comes with 1 handmade chocolate for each person. My favorites were anything with salmon and the boys' favorite  was obviously the wagyu beef (which is SO TENDER and melts in your mouth and that is saying something because I don't even eat much meat). I honestly loved probably 10 dishes and only disliked 3 but I'm a firm believer in trying out new things. All in all, I would save 2.5 hours for this meal because it is truly a dining experience and a party for your taste buds!"}, {"review_id": "OvavQCIcSsyzLizY4bqtoQ", "user_id": "I1DDDJwO5Fi1UKSKa7iCbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "We did the 18-course, the flavors were mind blowing.
