They were simply not as good as our other selections.Emily suggested the spicy Miso ramen and the Tori something-or-other for our main courses.  Both were absolutely delicious, with the Tori being the best ramen I've ever eaten, without question.  The spicy ramen was not overwhelmingly spicy, which was nice.  If you want your ramen spicier you could order a garlic chili bomb for 50 cents.  It was a lot of food for two people, but it was oh so worth it.  This place is legit, OKC.  Even if ramen isn't your thing, give this place a try.  Gorō Ramen will probably change your mind."}, {"review_id": "lv8e4zYsCZ2BKgWJG9PMsA", "user_id": "fecDYNPM9WsbZy0FZ4wfrA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "When it comes to good, late night restaurants in OKC, it's slim pickings. So when I typed, \"late night\" into Yelp and saw that Goro was open till 12am, I was pleasantly surprised.I have stayed away from Goro for quite some time because most of what I've heard is that it just isn't as good as the other ramen shop nearby. But that's not a fair reason to stay away from a place, so I was actually excited to check it out.Very small restaurant, but my friend and I were seated right away. It was fairly busy for around 10:30-11pm but service was still fairly quick. What blew my mind was how dark this place was. I'm all for low lights and chill atmosphere, but we were struggling to read the menu at times.When the food finally came, I kid you not, it was hard to see the details. I took a picture with flash on and that was the only time I could see all the different parts of the bowl. It felt like one of those scary movies where the main character can only see the ghosts in the camera after they take the picture. I'm sure things are more visible during the day, but I don't like not being able to clearly see what I'm eating.Back to the menu, there's only 3 ramen selections on a menu of like 30 items. I find it weird to have \"Ramen\" in the name, but then make it seem like ramen is just a side item you can order. I went with the first option which is the Tori Paitan.Their ramen broth is all (I say \"all\" but there are only 2 options) chicken based, except for the 3rd option which is a vegan broth. From my understanding and past experiences, ramen is usually a pork based broth giving you a much more savory and fattier broth. My bowl just tasted like a fancier chicken noodle soup. Noodles tasted great and the bamboo was good, but that's about it.The egg was delicious, but there was only a half egg. Half an egg! And to get an extra would be another $1.50. The pork belly was far from \"melt in your mouth\" as you might normally think of pork belly to be. It just tasted like a piece of lean meat thrown into broth. I liked the fried garlic pieces that were grouped on the left side, but once I mixed it all together, the garlic was so overpowering throughout the meal. Had I known there was so much garlic, I might have taken some of it out, but you know, I CAN'T SEE because Goro wants to save on electricity.I can't see myself returning when I can get more food for less money from the competition close by. I'm sorry, Goro but it's just not going to work out between us.."}, {"review_id": "4VO_iVj_pdksh3foAU54dw", "user_id": "JStGvn39V7L-84AWf2Sf7A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "We went here for the ramen and I was disappointed on the limited options on their menu. The ramen itself was ok, the broth is the base of it all and I personally thought it needed more seasoning added to it. I prefer Tamashii Ramen any day. Overall, the place was cute but very small. It definitely gave that hipster/modern vibe, but I personally wouldn't come back unless I had to for a friends event or something in the nature."}, {"review_id": "rZWVVNeYjeT6I8IivfwX9Q", "user_id": "A84BDSbdQPdqtvS_DHx62Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Gorō RamenThis little ramen shop on 16th Street has kept on doin' its thing. As it turns out, this little spot and I have finally found our groove together. The sweet spot for me is somewhere in between the yasai vegan broth ramen and wakame salad. I love to eat meat so whenever I began coming here I'd opt for the tori paitan ramen, or chicken stock ramen with pork belly. Turns out, we still aren't friends, but the yasai vegan broth ramen and the spicy miso ramen and I get along swimmingly well. I really enjoy the yasai ramen sub pork belly (for tofu) and a side of gochujang spicy chili paste and extra noodles. Another one I've grown to love is the spicy miso, though I think my vegan ramen combo inches out ahead. They have great wakame salad for starters as well. Good food. Service has been great. I'll be back."}, {"review_id": "MUcxj4CZKnuVlDE8MVsuKg", "user_id": "z_9oeZ5aN8g8AzPNENht8w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Who said that they don't have culture in OKC?  And better yet.. they have 4.5 star ramen.  I am not Japanese.. but if you're from Japan or California.. you're not going to be impressed.  Luckily, this place is open late because sadly most places in this city close at 10 or 10:30pm.  The vibe here is dark and trendy.. tons of people are hanging out at the bar and at tables.  Service is friendly where they answer your questions and check on the table regularly.Now onto my favorite part.. the alcohol.  The cloudy sake that I normally get was $50 here.  It's fine.. probably most people don't think of getting it.. we got the $20 cloudy sake which was fine and more sweet.Then we got the chicken karrage which was tasty and tender.  Very good.  I would definitely get that.  THe pickles are good as well.. the mayo is good for somebody who wants to make a richer dish.Now onto the main show.. that's the ramen.  I got the spicy miso ramen.  The meatballs are good, tender, and tasty.. the broth was just okay... perhaps it is a fusion place and not meant to be like in traditional ramen spots.  The toppings and size was very big.. the noodles were overcooked and mushy.  It's a fusion bowl of ramen in my opinion.. so, just keep that in mind.Besides that, the place was fine.. the seats could have been a little more comfortable.  OKC is trying and it is appreciated.  As an Asian who lives in a big city, I would not say this place would be rated nearly as high in a place like, Los Angeles.

It came with thicker noodle , veggies, including green onion, bean sprout, etc, soy sauce egg. The size is a bit to bigger than i expected and it is $15.99.That night i also ordered my favorite appetizer, pork belly. it is a 'must-try' in my opinion. You cant never go wrong with this one. In addition, my boyfriend also ordered the vegetarian selection. It was really good as far as vegetarian goes. We also order some drinks that night including double dragon & rude awakening. Double dragon is very good for those who like citrus drink. Really remind me of Stiegl Radler beer. The rude awakening is those who love coffee kinda drink. They both are really good regardless :)"}, {"review_id": "DdKiwaPydd1F6XXDZSOgVw", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "What to get: tori paitanService: 4/5Atmosphere: trendy, casual ramen jointWait: 0 mins at the bar (Saturday 8PM for 1)Parking: Street parkingThe Experience:In a land of BBQ and comfort food, ramen is like an oasis in a desert. Locals claim this to be the best ramen in town and I'd have to nod in agreement that the ramen here is pretty good for being located in Oklahoma.Goro is on a busy street, so you can find street parking on a street or two over. The outside looks like a dive bar and the entrance is past a outdoor patio area.I'm thankful that there were seats at their 'bar' area for this solo diner. It was luck when I got there because soon after I arrived, all the seats at the bar were filled. The place looks like it can get crowded very easily, so come early. It does get loud in there, but the atmosphere is very comfortable and welcoming.To start, I tried the pork belly nikuman, which is fried pork belly in buns. You get two per order, which were tasty but not that great of a deal.Save room for the ramen. I decided on the popular 'tori saitan,' which has fried garlic floating in the bowl. It's not a pho bowl size, but don't let that deceive you. The fresh noodles and broth can be quickly filling. Sadly, I wasn't able to finish it, but it was everything I had hoped for. You can also get a 'chili bomb' to add to your broth to make it a little spicier. I didn't need to add much, but it was a nice addition.I did get to talk with some locals while there, but as a solo diner, I probably wouldn't have stayed that long if I had come just to eat. A nice place to go with a small group of friends for a satisfying dinner, but not somewhere to schmooze for an extended period.

Although their bowls are smaller than other places, it is still more than enough food and well worth the price.

Located in the Plaza District, Goro Ramen is a great restaurant to take friends that are visiting OKC for the first time. I've been here on various days and times, and it is always packed. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations. However, they take down your phone number when you put yourself on the waitlist and will text you once your table is ready. This lets you either grab a drink at their bar or at one of the bars down the street. This also gives you the opportunity to explore the many unique, eclectic, and fun shops in the Plaza District or take pictures in front of the beautiful wall murals, distracting you from getting hangry from having to wait.However, the wait is well worth it. They have a few ramen options including a vegan and a gluten-free option. Personally, I always order the Spicy Miso as I like my food spicy. It is just the perfect level of spicy, but for those die hard spicy lovers, they do have a house-made garlic chili bomb that you can get for 50 cents and add some more heat to your ramen. I didn't give the restaurant five stars just because I've had my fair share of ramen in various areas/states, and Goro Ramen is not the best ramen I have ever had. Although it is my go to place to get ramen in Oklahoma, I know tourists coming from places such as New York, Colorado, or Texas may be a slightly unimpressed especially if you try to compare it to ramen in those areas. I also wish it had more ramen options such as one with a pork based broth. However, Goro Ramen will for sure fulfill your ramen cravings and leave you satisfied, and for the locals, this is the place you definitely want to go to satisfy your ramen needs."}, {"review_id": "LHQYREPFjU0Sd6FPPPQW8Q", "user_id": "JHgVWFfCn9qjeupe5iXVNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "I came to OKC for a work trip - it was stressful and I was not impressed with the city.

The tori paitan seemed classic and very delicious, homey and filling. I do not usually order desserts but I was 3 for 3 at this point so I thought why not. The mochi cake with blueberry and whipped cream was like the best muffin ever.
