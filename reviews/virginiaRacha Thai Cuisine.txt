It was a great choice because the food and the service were great. We were seated immediately and a server came over and asked for our drinks. Based off of reviews I ordered a Thai tea with milk and it was delicious. Easily one of the best drinks I've ever had. Defiantly order it you won't be sorry and they give you one free refill. I ordered the Tom Kha soup with shrimp as an appetizer. This was really good, the broth was amazing. My only complaint is that the veggies that were in it (onions and tomatoes) were not cut small enough and were hard to eat with a spoon. I ordered the Pad Thai and my boyfriend had Curry. I recommend being cautious with your spice level. I ordered a 1 spice and it was a bit much for me. My boyfriend did a 3 spice and he had trouble too. Lol if it wasn't for the Thai tea I don't think we would have made it. The portions were great and aside from the spice the food was awesome. We'll definitely be back and we'll be sure to go easy on the spice!"}, {"review_id": "aCF0Zi4k1oreP2Jt0m5nZw", "user_id": "ApUP3rYDHW5L_z_Hq4nRZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/16/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Where is Juke? Juke was our server the last time we came and I loved her suggestions on the spices to use with certain dishes. This trip we met Toey who was just as friendly and knowledgeable.I enjoyed the spicy fish sauce with the Basil Rice. Perfecto! It made me come back here a second time to eat. Yes, I  had the same dish just to make sure that they can produce the deliciousness that they delivered the first time I came. They did not let me down. Sad to say I tried a Thai restaurant back home, ordered their Basil rice and Ew, it was burnt and the flavor was NOT there! Not to mention they did not have the spiciness of this Thai restaurant. I  love it soooo much, I'm moving down here just to be closer!

It has a nice relaxing zen kind of ambiance. The staff was very friendly and nice to our kid (always nice, not always a given). There weren't many people there, so it served as a quiet respite from a hectic day. My wife had shrimp pad Thai, which was delicious. I had a beef curry dish which was wonderful. I'll say that it wasn't very spicy, something I find a tad disappointing but whether that's good or bad is really up to you. Overall great experience, tasty food and a nice atmosphere. I'm definitely interested in returning next time I'm in the area to try something else on their menu. If you like Thai food, this could be a bit of a hidden gem.

The food is better, the interior is brighter, and the service is excellent.My family and I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and I was surprised to find out they have a lunch menu on weekends. We were welcomed by smiling staff members and were told to sit anywhere we'd like in the restaurant. Our waitress then proceeded to take down our orders. I ordered the beef Pad Thai (medium spice) and a Thai iced tea. The rest of my family ordered chicken kao pad and chicken red curry with mango (medium spice). A few minutes later, everyone at the table received a complimentary plate of salad and an egg roll. I've had free soup and salad before but not eggrolls!MAN, EVERYTHING WAS SO FLAVORFUL. The spice in my Pad Thai was just right as it enhanced the flavor of the dish. The fresh bean sprouts' coolness balanced the spice, and there was so much beef in the dish! This was my first time having Thai iced tea, and I decided to order it since it seemed to be popular. They serve it in a huge cup, and it comes with one free refill. I was full from one cup and was able to take my refill to-go. Thai iced tea reminds me of the Filipino drink, sago at gulaman. What stood out to me the most during my visit was the impeccable service. Everyone had such a positive attitude, and we were checked on often. The chef even came out twice to personally greet us and make sure the food met our expectations.I was a frequent patron of Royal Thai before Racha Thai took over, but I don't know why it took me this long to see what Racha was all about! Definitely my favorite Thai restaurant in the area. I will be coming back again and recommending this place to friends!"}, {"review_id": "YWQzc64l2GGC2wjp-Sjdhw", "user_id": "Nw8xEp7xxcWBn3OHZhrz3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/12/2017", "text": "Really solid Thai food! We've been spending a lot of time in the area near the medical center, and stumbled on this place for lunch. I've been twice now and it's pretty good! Both times I've been in, it hasn't been particularly crowded. Service is fast and friendly. One of my visits was with the four year old and the staff was super friendly to him, plus he destroyed the shrimp tempura. I've had both the shrimp pad thai and the pork pad thai. The flavors are pretty good - though I'd prefer more peanut flavor and protein that is less done (both the shrimp and the pork were pretty tough). Comes with a super tasty salad though - very fresh with a lovely dressing and a crispy spring roll. But where this place really wins my heart is the mango sticky rice - BEST I've ever had. Just simply amazing. I'm planning to venture into new territory next time we stop in - it's a solid 4.5 in my book."}, {"review_id": "6EY-lb19ntVO_vP9PLIY_A", "user_id": "dy2dCDIUImTMsj7aRugAFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/2/2017", "text": "Absolutely delicious and I can't wait to come back for more.

Sadly, I was informed they haven't had Khao Man Gai in a long time, so I just picked something else to try out. Please update your menus if you no longer have entrees available. So, I strayed from the Thai pre-made curries and stir-fried noodles as I can make those at home because it's so much cheaper and they'll be right how I like them -- strong, bold flavors and spicy! Unless the curry paste is made in house, there's not too much point in finding out which brand was used.On the Table:- Salad: this could be complimentary; lettuce, tomato, cucumber, thin carrots, with a light, ginger dressing.- Racha Chicken Wings: fried wings with sweet chili sauce; nice crisp and taste, but wasn't spicy at all.- Tod Man Pla: the fish cakes definitely smelled like fried oil, had the texture of those firm, chewy fish balls that you put in soup, and wasn't spicy even though red curry was used. The dip had cucumber, red onion, sugar, vinegar, crushed peanuts, and what tasted like red bell pepper -- this should be Thai red chili pepper or similar. Red bell pepper is not a substitute for red chili pepper. I think Thai sweet chili sauce would've been better -- well, if that had some heat too.- Salmon With Ginger: a nice, big piece of tender salmon with a light, brown sauce, topped with veggies: onion, red bell pepper, carrots, celery, beans, and was missing the green onions (per description). I was hoping for a strong, ginger sauce but it tasted mainly of light soy sauce. Was the ginger julienned atop intended as a garnish? I couldn't tell the salmon was grilled per their description; it may have not been a hard grill for a little char. Also, I'm not sure why the waitress asked spice level when there is none in here. Some chili garlic paste may have been nice here though.- Cashew Chicken (Chef's Specialties): those snow peas!! I think those were snap peas because snow peas are flat. There was so much stringiness that it was like chewing on tough, thick versions of celery strings!! I think someone forgot to remove them. The cashews didn't seem toasted/fried and were just regular, unsalted cashews. I didn't poke much at his plate after those, but the sauce seemed like a light soy sauce base. My boyfriend said the vegetables had more flavor than the chicken, and the chicken wasn't crispy.- Thai Tea: a large cup with a good, strong tea flavor until you are overwhelmed by the sweetened condensed milk taking up 4/5 of the cup after mixing. The refill to go was offered. The proportion of milk in this was still high. Maybe that's what was left for the evening.- Coca-Cola: no Pepsi offered here.I don't feel like this place is a strong reference for Thai food -- maybe like a Thai-lite. Also, I'm not sure why there are spicy pepper symbols all over the menu. Although spice is different from heat, the base product's spice level is tame. To me, cooking with spice is different from adding it on at the end (yourself); cooking allows all of the flavors to marry and makes the food taste that much better. Adding heat afterwards isn't going to fix the spice level. Westernized catering has been making fulfilling my cravings hard. I feel like I just had American Chinese food with watery, diluted sauce. I didn't notice any bold, vibrant intensity to the dishes that characterize Thai cooking; they were too light-handed.Service: I wish they greeted with a form of \"sawasdee\" but that's silly, wishful thinking on my part. The waitress and elder lady that served the room were very nice and they were very active with checking in. Oddly, the waitress didn't know the specials that were posted near their front door -- which I asked about and she had to check the front door. They do honor requests of excluding ingredients though.At least we got full with pleasant, mildly-flavored food, have some leftovers, and it's not unhealthy. Overall, the place is nice, the food is fresh and tastes nice (even slowly heated the next day), but it wasn't what I was expecting from the bold, vibrant Thai cuisine I'm used to from my mum, and they need to revise the descriptions/offerings on their menu."}, {"review_id": "VboE7HXqef_3qjdpEXrOFA", "user_id": "v-js_ZZr6jsResEuhCQdEw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "6/1/2017", "text": "I broke my rule of eating at a restaurant that has a \"Under New Management\" sign.This almost always indicates some kind of dysfunction.We went here for Mother's day.  The service was just okay, the food was not very good, and their prices were more on the expensive side."}, {"review_id": "3MY9U6bZhDuZbIptfzrIbg", "user_id": "95269PlLocGn9j4CERKQCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2017", "text": "Great food. Good Service. Uncomfortably Casual Staff.  Unique décor.Walking up to the establishment it feels like a traditional strip-mall eatery, but when you open the door the feel of the building changes.  They have managed to make the restaurant feel warm and inviting in a very cold and cookie cutter environment.   We were greeted promptly by the host, and taken to our table.  The lobby is a bit cramped but, unless there is a wait, you will not be there for long.   The tablecloths are a bit dated but the table tops were very clean, and on each table was a fresh red rose, a very nice touch. I wish the tables had felt a bit sturdier to the touch.  I am a bit heavy handed and can tilt a table without effort.   The menu looks to have been kept simple and while they have a large assortment of dishes they seem to stem from the same core group of ingredients, allowing them to remain fresh.  It always worries me when an establishment has a very extensive menu with little common ingredients - Normally a signifier of lesser quality ingredients.  Our first dish to arrive was the Goong Hom Pa (Shrimp in a blanket).   This dish was cooked extremely well; the shrimp and crab were done but not over cooked.  The texture was ideal for a wrapped dish, crispy outside with a firm-smooth inside.  The wrapper had a slight trace of salt that paired well to balance the shrimp and crab's sweetness.    A very pleasurable appetizer.  Our two main entrées were the 'Racha Pad Thai - Pork' and the 'Kao Pad - Beef'.  The Pad Thai was very well seasoned and the sauce used was some of the best I have ever had.  The noodles were correctly cooked, the only thing I wish was different was the depth of the flavor.  I wish the sauce were a bit more concentrated, as I have had on different occasions.  This however is not a mark against them as they do offer a fine array of spices to supplement different pallets.  [Pickled  red Thai Peppers, red Thai Pepper Sauce, Dried Thai chilies, and pickled whole slices of green thai chilies]The Kao Pad used good quality beef and vegetables but was slightly undercooked. I prefer my rice to be left on the heat until the rice has a delicate resistance but no firm centers. This rice had a firm, semi-hard center. The flavors the beef, onions and oil they used were of great quality.   If this dish was cooked properly, I am sure It would have been amazing.  However, because the rice was slightly undercooked I will be deducting a star.  The service was of very high quality; I do not know if it is usual but I did not find the Jeans and T-Shirt attire of the service members to be appealing.   It may be comfortable to them, but without having visited this location before it was hard to figure out who was staff or who was a customer.  This may not be an issue mid-afternoon on a weekday but if this were a busy weekend night it could lead to issues with folks not being able to find their server promptly; This could lead to a degradation of service.   I will consider this a wash and not remove a star for the lack of uniform.  Had the service been anything other than perfect I would have removed a star for this.  Overall, Racha Thai Cuisine is a repeat location for me.  The flavors, unique dishes, warm décor, and inviting staff will have me revisiting this location any time I feel the need for some Thai food on the south side."}, {"review_id": "DwTrOSQEZn3CVDzRH5qaUg", "user_id": "x-lcwwzWd33LWKUwAKnv8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/29/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I got take-out on Saturday.  While I waited, they gave me warm and tasty cups of tea.  The food was delicious.  Everyone in my house was elated about the food.  The restaurant is clean- down to the bathrooms.Visited this restaurant a second time - love the orange chicken and the chicken skewers."}, {"review_id": "rN4jAL1GWeG9hYdigVMPnA", "user_id": "qiQd2WOUWR-uUKFdZvcokA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Excellent food, great customer service leading to a very pleasant experience.
