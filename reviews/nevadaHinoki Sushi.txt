Good food with good service at decent prices. Food: excellent! Large variety of rolls and appetizers. We usually come here for the all you can eat sushi which starts with a variety of cold and hot dishes, sushi then ends with desert. Our fave is the tempura banana ice cream!Prices: the all you can eat menu is a good deal at $19.99 for lunch given it includes beverages and literally all you can eat appetizers and sushi. Only downside is you can only have one desert. Customer service: staff is super friendly and remember you if you come in often. They're quick to take your order and bring your food. Location: it's a large restaurant with lots of tables and a sushi bar. Lots of parking. Good vibes. Highly recommend Hinoki Sushi!"}, {"review_id": "bnX7MDcEOakEW5yKJjZglg", "user_id": "9nuv3DsQJFjApI3UgHvgxQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Three stars go towards the friendly service, The nigiri (salmon, unagi, salmon roe, white tuna, and escolar), the price for an AYCE dinner, and the fact that apps and desserts are included. But their rolls aren't that awesome. My avocado was browning at some parts. There was no wow factor in any of the ones we ordered.

I am always really impressed with the quality of the sushi and precision from the sushi chefs. Service is also great and you get everything fast.I stuck with my usual by ordering a ton of nigiri and just one roll. The salmon is great, hamachi is also fantastic. My favorite here though is the Escolar, I highly recommend trying it. The Hinoki roll is really different but also really good. They put a basil sauce and balsamic sauce on it and I thought it was great! Definitely check this place out next time you want sushi. Order a bunch of nigiri because that's where you get the most fish."}, {"review_id": "yGTep6RRynbk0iyg_9SaZw", "user_id": "KDz7BjsuBjAxBw2gF3KFQA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "We are so lucky in Reno we have so many AYCE sushi options! I particularly don't feel anything that special about this place. I know their menu is very creative and they have unique rolls, but what about the experience? First of all, when you walk in, you feel like inside a cafeteria, it's just these wood uncomfortable tables with seats. The wall is just empty, there is only like one painting, no decoration or anything that makes you feel welcome. FOOD: I think the food is really good, great quality, I love how creative their menu is. I love how they play with flavors, I really liked the \"Hinoki\" roll, the \"ceviche\" roll it's amazing! So refreshing! I liked their Bugs Bunny's and their \"upside down shrimps.\" I also think their menu lacks things, calamari for example and more dessert options. I went with a vegan friend and they only had ice cream! Normally they have other options, like a fruit or something. I normally love yakiton at sushi places, the one here was just good. I liked the tofu better! SERVICE: I was not very impressed with the service, in fact this is the first time I've had a service not very enthusiastic in a while, the girl didn't recommend anything, she let the plates to piled up, no water refill, I don't remember if she came to check how our food was.Overall, I would give this place a 3.5 stars just because their sushi is delicious, however, like I said, for me going out and having sushi is more like an experience. The ambience in this place is just so plain!"}, {"review_id": "lSlqKX6stcoDkDV4sX6A5g", "user_id": "V985yOjZFlhek2wFJjsebA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Our favorite sushi spot in Reno!The sushi is always fresh and beautifully plated.

I know why this restaurant has great reviews. Sake is great. Unfiltered Tozai. Sashimi is fresh. They do thicker cuts of fish than what is customary. But I'm not complaining.

He described this place as \" They have very yummy sushi, and there's one kind of sushi that nowhere else offers.\" I came here with high hope on a snowy day.First impression of this place is: Are they still decorating the dining area or what? Because this look and setup feels very rushed. Bunch of tables in the middle of the dinning area, some tables are too close together, not much privacy.  Oh, sticky floor as well. I can't put up with sticky floor, it makes me cringe.Waitresses were friendly, came to take empty plates and garbage off our table quite often which is always nice.Now the food. Didn't feel the Wow factor, but definitely not bad. It is just your average everyday sushi restaurant just like every other sushi restaurant. Nothing bad, but nothing stands out as well. It's one of those place when your friends say I wanna go to Hinoki Sushi, u won't say no, but you won't actively come back alone. Overall average, I want to give a 3 star, which is the definition of \"A-Ok\" but nowadays it is hard for business to survive already, so yea there u go a 4 star. I hope this place can make better sushi or create something special that make people want to come back."}, {"review_id": "JCTaNerldVkipHZpdFAtww", "user_id": "vHc-UrI9yfL_pnnc6nJtyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Did someone say poke?Seems like there's a poke shop opening in every corner of our Fine city. To tell you the truth, I'm just fine with that because it means more variety in both the fast casual and sushi categories! The only thing I'm not fine excited about are how these restaurants impact our favorite sushi stops. Fortunately some sushi restaurants were proactive, like Hinoki, and they started offering poke bowls as an a la charge option a few months before the first poke shop opened. Unlike the other shops, the poke bowls at Hinoki are not build-your-own, instead they're a more crafted combination of fish, veggies and toppings that are all held together by delicious sushi rice and their house poke sauce. The sauce is just the right balance of sweet and salty with a hit of acid from citrus and a slightly spicy tang. They toss the fish in a heavy dose of it before placing it over the rice. I usually ask for a little extra on the bowl. The toppings are just what you expect, and I love the addition of spring mix greens, for more freshness, and the yamagobo, which is like a Japanese carrots. The bowl is a great size for one hungry person. In the past I've gotten the small bowl at other places and found myself hungry. I've never had that happen at Hinoki. Sometimes I add a salmon skin handroll. It's just sod damn good.So South Reno residents OR those in the area OR anyone looking for solid poke, head to Hinoki! This ish is good!"}, {"review_id": "_6UrJssNxl7JYsQwTO-MDg", "user_id": "S_BD0m7gsYAHqBDqOK5EEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "After finally picking our first sushi spot in Reno, this is where we chose after yelping sooooo many sushi options around Reno. Arrived on a Sunday night at about 715... pretty busy on the inside . Luckily as we walked in the door, 2 spots at the sushi bar opened up so we slid right in. This place was awesome from the start. The sushi chef was super attentive and listened to what we liked and disliked and created any unique combination .  Everything here from start to finish was top notch.  The speed of service, that quality of food, and just our overall satisfaction.   Reading previous reviews, it looks like they had just raised the price to 24.99 for dinner . And we read they used to serve mochi at the end. That's ok though. We started off with some edamame and an order of gyoza. And right from the start I knew it was going to be excellent.  The gyoza was delicious and unique.  Well everything was unique here . Need I remind you the chef (Gerson) was totally attentive and respectful of us the entire dining experience. We moved on to Donald Duck and spicy tuna and the fish to rice ratio was just perfection. This has been the best nigiri I have ever had .  They don't overserve the rice , huge in my book! I also had 1 upside down shrimp which was once again delicious . Our first roll choices were the Casanova and mermaid. I absolutely loved the Casanova.   The way the mango balanced with the jalapeño was just unbelievable . My wife of course loved her mermaid.  We knew we were in for a treat .   Next up was captain crunch and playboy.   That salmon skin on the captain crunch just put this roll over the top.  Delicious bite after bite .   Our third rolls were the king kong (no teriyaki , add spicy sauce) and the workout .  These were two very unique rolls.  My wife isn't a fan of teriyaki so the spicy sauce substitution was perfect for her . Another delicious roll.  The ONLY thing I would have done differently on my workout roll would be to negate the wasabi mayo.  The roll was delicious . I am just not a fan of wasabi but wanted to step out of the box since all this food was amazing I couldn't go wrong . Finally I ended with a half tundra roll.  I wasn't sure if I was able to finish a whole I'll at this point and I was saving room for banana tempura ice cream.  The tundra roll was presented beautifully and tasted delicious .  I can't stress the fact that all of these rolls and even the nigiri had such a perfect rice ratio. See my pics.   They didn't load you up with fillers and we were able to try so many things.   We WILL  be back to eat sushi here before we head back home to Chicago . Chicago doesn't have good priced delicious all you can eat like this Reno.  Come here and come here often !!Oh yea and the banana tempura ice cream was good as well."}, {"review_id": "YOEYzwODV8etMVyQyk6VAg", "user_id": "tjrRFKDxpRGqrMWTh3_vWg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Hubby and I wanted to try a new sushi joint and came across hinoki through yelp.They had good ratings and review and thought we'll try it.

Again, everything was going great until one of our servers said we can't order half sushi's anymore especially when they're busy(which they weren't) and explained why-which we totally understood. We were confused because one of the servers that served us the first time said the chefs are accommodating and would happily do half orders of sushi.

The people at this restaurant are super nice - service is great - very friendly servers and they brought everything i ordered really quickly. They let you order anything off the menu for $20 at lunch time. Includes the cooked options like chicken teriyaki, tempura, salads etc, in addition to the sushi.  I was somewhat disappointed by the quality of the rolls - especially the one with tempura shrimp inside. The shrimp tasted like it had been made way too early (tempura coating was hard and not freshly crispy).  But the yellowtail nigiri sushi was a generous cut of fresh fish - it was my favorite. The ceviche roll was ok, wouldn't order it again. This is a very good restaurant, especially for the price, but it is not as good as other sushi restaurants in the Bay Area or LA. I would come back for more of the nigiri sushi and to try the other items on the menu when I'm in the area."}, {"review_id": "jtInKeZ-5s5yFk97T7hCgQ", "user_id": "zAiYfiG_hMevEq2Eb6R3jg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Very fast service.

My favorites were the Hinoki and the Captain Crunch. The basil sauce of the Hinoki roll provided such a unique flavor. I've never heard of basil in sushi, but it's a phenomenal combination. The Captain Crunch's salmon skin was awesome! Crispy, salty, and a perfect contrast to the chewy sushi rice. Dragon and King Kong rolls were good as well. Not a big fan of the Workout roll- tasted of nothing but smoke.We also ordered lots of nigiri, and I really loved their tamago, unagi, and escolar. Definitely get the escolar! It's so fresh and feels like butter in your mouth. Hinoki has solid nigiri. Their fish is fresh and the fish to rice ratio is good.As for the appetizers, we ordered mussels (little overcooked), takoyaki (served HOT and topped with benito flakes), and miso soup (solid). A friend who ordered the teriyaki chicken absolutely loved it! Said it was the best teriyaki chicken she's ever had. AYCE has raised in price to $20 for lunch. Mochi has also been replaced by ice cream in the menu. Location is just south of the airport. Not a big fan of the lackluster decor here- ambiance could be improved.

Not only does this place have affordable prices for AYCE, but the quality is head and shoulders above most sushi spots in Reno. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, and I'd gladly take a date here. The waitstaff was very attentive and polite. Apparently a chef from Hiroba now works here, which explains why it's so delicious. The menu had great variety, unlike many paces where every roll tastes the same. I highly recommend the Hinoki roll. The combination of basil and balsamic on it blew my mind, and it's now one of my favorite rolls, ever. Not to mention it's GORGEOUS. I love food that's both beautiful and delicious. The Yoyo roll also has a unique, fruity flavor, and they'll gladly put some raw fish on top (I chose hamachi) if you want a fishier taste. Definitely try the yakiton.

It had just the right amount of saltiness and spice to accompany the melt in your mouth fish that they serve here.
