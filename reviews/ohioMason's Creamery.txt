Everything is homemade (ice cream, waffle cones, etc). They have flavors such as French toast where they drizzle some maple syrup on your ice cream, Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk glaze, taro, graham cracker and so much more. They switch out flavors too depending on the season. It amazes me how much the flavor tastes like the real food. You can try the flavors before ordering which is great.Something to note is that this is a very small ice cream shop. Majority of the seating is outdoors so during the summer, it's packed. During the winter, there isn't really anywhere to sit since about only 10 people can fit inside. However, don't let the space deter you because it's super cute. They have string lights and picnic tables outside, murals around the store and it has an old diner kind of feel. I come here all the time all year round!"}, {"review_id": "J6OAqikgR3xEoy1hh_F25Q", "user_id": "tXtGiwmVW5yewr8-BOpI2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "I had such a great time here!!! The staff is so friendly (honestly like chatting with friends) and the whole place just exudes joy and warmth. They aren't just there to serve ice cream, but seem to really want to get to know their customers and what we want. They usually have a board up of flavor suggestions that customers can contribute to and they actually make it happen!Mason's has so many unique ice cream flavors, as well as plenty of vegan options. I got the pineapple upside down cake (with pineapple chunks, YUM) and marzipan and it was DELICIOUS and creamy and smooth. They also gave us a complimentary egg waffle, and that with ice cream? AMAZING. Would recommend 100%!"}, {"review_id": "cuAlYJPMdA_2yY9yuOmMOQ", "user_id": "BGWcW_I1d8Q-Agh5NiubHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "Mason's is one of my favorite places in town! The staff is always so friendly, the owners are the best as well! I don't have anything bad to say about this place! The ice cream is always amazing, they change flavors like weekly or twice a week. They started serving soft serve as well that is just as good! If you ever make it in, get an egg waffle or the banana bread split if they bring it back!They even do a pop up ramen night and it's definitely worth it and legit! But always get there early or as soon as they post something on their Instagram because it will will out before your eyes lol but in a good way. They even have vegan options!!!"}, {"review_id": "ZBiHmUJqTlk_B24T-mAVHA", "user_id": "_pkwfwQx9--_sueH4yJ6hg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Weird flavors.

Not only do they have the best servers, but they also have interesting and fun ice cream flavors! I walked in on a quiet Sunday afternoon and I was immediately greeted by the server. My friends and I tried (almost) all of their flavors and they were always very enthusiastic about them! There was no limit, and I loved that all of their spoons were metal. One of my friends told the server to surprise him, and the guy clapped his hands in excitement! He ended up with a chocolate and coffee milkshake with chocolate ganache swirled in, nutella whipped cream and a hot churro inside! (AMAZING)The flavors at Mason's change quite often, but they are always delicious! I ended up getting Coconut pudding and dark chocolate orange. My only regret is that I did not have enough room for their Taro flavor, which was creamy and very mild in the sweetness. The decoration is very cute and rustic. The whole experience is very fun and tasty!"}, {"review_id": "lwrERCBuBhebsKPRoqwTDQ", "user_id": "1_JELIFSgGVwz4oZVbcXrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "My first visit to Mason's Creamery was last summer and I got the strawberries & cream and mango lassi and remember being underwhelmed after the hype I've heard about this place... But I've really grown to LOVE this little ice-cream shop. I think the best thing that Mason's has to offer is, unique flavors aside, the owners' (and staff's) dedication to trying new things, taking risks and truly interacting and investing in their community. They host movie nights, international pot lucks...As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it might be a bit harder for creatures of habit who want to get the same thing every time, because you're never going to get that with Mason's! But for me, that's the best part. I'm always excited to hear what they have to offer which varies almost every day--just check Instagram! It's so much more than just ice-cream, some of the \"specials\" I've gotten in just less than a year of frequenting the place: apple cinnamon bread pudding with brown sugar whiskey ice-cream, shamrock shake, black soft serve, and their famous pop-up ramen!Some of favorite flavors to date: black sesame, matcha, brownie batter, hawaiian sour plum, banana pudding... Also, don't leave without trying an egg waffle. The standard is an egg waffle with two scoops of ice-cream on it topped with whipped cream, but my favorite way to get it is just an egg waffle on its own and I rip each circle off and scoop a bit of ice-cream with it. That way no part of your waffle gets soggy!So pleased to have this gem in my community!"}, {"review_id": "FLqdrUoF8kL0XoVW01h8Kg", "user_id": "90PoKtkdZTyhHNI7q3i2EQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "Mason is a great ice cream shop that has an ever changing menu. But, for people like me who like the same kind of ice cream, it is a little bit harder to get excited to go to Mason's compared to some other ice cream stores in the area. I find the ice cream a little bit to ice ish. For those who love to try different and unique flavors this is the place to be. I know recently they had a bacon flavored ice cream that a friend of mine loved.The reason that I gave Mason's a higher rating than three stars is because of additional things that Mason's offers. For anyone who has a dog Mason's offers a free scope of ice cream for the dog. While I was house sitting for a friend I took their dog to Mason's twice. The dog was so excited that once he saw Mason's he started barking and dragging me to the store. Once we entered the employees were so nice and happy to see the dog enjoying ice cream. Mason's also offers outdoor movie nights during the summer. Recently, I was able to go watch Hocus Pocus with a group of friends. It was a nice alternative from going to the bars or staying home.While Mason's may not wow me in the ice cream department I will continue to go back because Mason's is great for the community and really cares about they people they serve."}, {"review_id": "BZ8S83fRo5wtQMp7lNAN3Q", "user_id": "IPaE4PKYqf5Z-N931pN2-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "This place is great. We got ramen on one of their ramen days (not always available check their instagram). This is not really an eat-in experience but that's totally ok. We ended up enjoying our ramen from the plastic takeaway containers so we could indulge in ice cream after. We had a \"flight\" and tried Marzipan, Halva, Baklava, Pineapple Upside Down and Taro. All fantastic and from what I hear the flavors are constantly changing. Staff is great too. They'll give you ice cream for your dog if you have one with you.

I am an ice cream lover, so whenever I travel I have to try the best ice cream around and I think this is it! So when you ask people what is the best ice cream in Ohio, many people will name the big most common names of ice cream but that wasn't what I was looking for...I was on the search for the best ice cream, the diamond in the dirts...the gems and I found it here on Bridge Ave (it took a lot of searches on my end). The location is probably an area I would never go to if I was just driving around, luckily I knew where I was going. Upon entering there was a beautiful outdoor seating area but it was too cold to sit down so I went in and was immediately greeted by the people in the front. The customer service was amazing, they strongly encourage you to sample every flavor as every day the flavors change. All of their ice cream and sorbet are freshly homemade. They even provide for vegans! I was so hesitant on what to get as EVERYTHING was soo good but I heard that they were known for their churro sandwiches in which it is a warm churro in between two scoops of ice cream which can range flavors. I got the churro sandwich with graham cracker and ginger snap ice cream and it was delicious! The churro was so warm and it melted the ice cream so delicately. The ice cream is served with a spoon that changes colors which is so cool! This place has been open for 2-3 years and is literally amazing--all for $6!! I encourage everyone to check this place out! Great customer service, delicious freshly made ice cream, and great options! I am spreading the word on this hidden gem!P.S. They even honor military discounts."}, {"review_id": "ms9dEI5J1dOUjXDA7lggWg", "user_id": "gJK2xAhGQV5zkApt5bQROg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Love this place! They have constantly changing flavors and take suggestions for new flavors. Ice cream is not too overpoweringly sweet, doesn't taste overly artificial, and texture/consistently is smooth but not too milky.

I appreciate this as it forces me to try something new. Last time, I tried taro ice cream and was surprised that it was actually creamy without sugar overload.  They also had some time of apple/cinnamon combo that was DIVINE.  I had a few bites of my husband's ice cream and had to restrain myself from eating all of it.  I believe they list their ice cream as all double scoops, but one time, they did just let me have one scoop so don't be afraid to ask. and try something new!"}, {"review_id": "lM7AcX5Emn4r-ZrD8UE1Lg", "user_id": "CW1XEtbKm60ucBqdyylnkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "Wow, we love this delicious local ice cream shop with flair!

The staff are always extremely friendly and personable. They're very encouraging of samples so you can make sure you're going to like what you get. They are dog friendly (inside and out!) so you can walk down with your pup and get them a doggy cup. It's small on the inside but it feels cozy that way. There's a bench, a few bar stools, and three tables for two. They also have a large patio which is great for the busy summer.

However, I was torn whether to give it 3 or 4 stars. My first visit here last summer, I felt forced to find a flavor I liked but they all tasted so \"icey.\" A year later, gave it another go and was much more satisfied but still not completely impressed. I can't pinpoint what it is exactly- the flavor concepts are there but not so pronounced, and the texture seems a little off, not as creamy as it should be. The atmosphere is so fun, especially in the summer. Be prepared to wait, but the line seems to move. The menu has some unique options for your ice cream- from the cookie sandwich to the tasty egg waffle. Can't forget to mention the flavored whipped cream...nutella anybody?! Settled on the black sesame and almond flavor (amaretto maybe?), which were satisfying after a big dinner. Flavors rotate, and I'd be willing to give it another whirl!"}, {"review_id": "acse37iNNh-U053Wi0HLoQ", "user_id": "mjI7P3bgKFuNUCA8MxEdPQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "I am not a huge ice cream fan, but I must say I crave this place often!

I was really sad I didn't get to try a churro with my ice cream (they closed down the fryer since it was 15 min. to closing time), but I was still very pleased with my experience. They have so many unique flavors, but also a couple standards. They apparently change regularly. I ended up getting a scoop of Tarot and a scoop of Cap'n Crunch. The Cap'n Crunch is made by letting the cereal soak in milk and then using that milk to create ice cream. It tasted exactly like the cereal milk AND they topped it with the cereal pieces. The Tarot actually just reminded me of a really delicious sweet cream ice cream. They were really cool about letting us sample multiple flavors too."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/masons-creamery-cleveland?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
