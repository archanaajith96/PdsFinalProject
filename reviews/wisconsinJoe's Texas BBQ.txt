Who took our order made great suggestions & we ended up with a little bit of everything. A full rack of ribs, chicken, brisket & pulled pork. Everything was just outstanding. The ribs were incredibly meaty and the smoke flavor was perfect. The brisket and pulled pork were moist and very flavorful and the chicken had fantastic flavor, but was just a tiny bit dry. The beans were sweet, but not too sweet, just right.This place is tiny and it would be easy to miss, but it's well worth looking for."}, {"review_id": "7TtSy_lr73dT-wui96DZIA", "user_id": "ya_W1POGtQ6u6D7nuCF9wQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "I am a BBQ junkie. I have had bbq all over and seek it out whenever I am in a new region. Including from Mike Mill's 17th St BBQ in Murhysboro, IL. Joe's is up there on my list of good bbq places.I figured out Joe's is in a new location from reviews and photos. The new place is not as nice as the old. But, still a nice place. I did not get much interaction from staff on my visit. Except Joe wanted to know my thoughts. And was more than willing to talk BBQ. He was helpful and offered much good advice on smoking techniques and happily answered my questions.Now for the food. While the menu is limited to just brisket, pulled pork and Joe's Burger for sandwiches and spare ribs the day I was there. That could be a good thing. \" Do a few things right instead of many things mediocre.\"I had the brisket sandwich with chips and a soda. The flavor of the brisket was perfect. Not over powered by smoke and some seasoning. It was so good I had to try the spare ribs. The ribs were excellent. Good flavor, tender but with a little chew and not falling apart or off the bone. I am glad I you d Joe's Texas BBQ. And will definately be back when I can."}, {"review_id": "onTrb7hWfkXPYVd_RHWYoQ", "user_id": "bMvlF-b5SljNPMHrvzndDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Brisket, chicken and ribs were fire!

I'm not a Rib guy so much but others who have them are all in. Everyone who finds Joe's 'hole in the wall' BBQ is happy about the flavors of sweet or tangy or spicy BBQ. Joe's s now on Holmgren where Skips used to be nextbto Pavkerland Glass.The dining outside and inside is like park quality. The plates and to-go containers made of foam. You don't go here for anything but great quality BBQ. There are no competitors for Joe's in Green Bay. I'd like it if they expanded the range of flavors and or some other options but I know they are hitting a food capacity now.Parking is odd and I usually choose to park in the street.  Didn't see outsid dinng, it is February.It would be a nice add-on to see a grill for making your own Texas Toast. One outdoor to add some touch to the BBQ look curbside. This outdoor toast grill could travel to the farmer's markets and serve up toast for $1.00. The potato salad is a quality Mustard base. Something like a jalapeño mixed Cowboy Caviar or potato salad would offer some unique options. The caviar is good and pickled just right, yet it's lost on my Texas map, not offering an ingredient to contrast the sweets. If the owners decide to expand beyond the catered money making plan they are currently managing they should consider some of the ideas here and in other Yelp reviews. As is I'm a regular at Joe's. I'm hoping they can expand properly to support their popularity. Growing an expanded menu or business plan will steal away the charm of street food. If I could I'd ride my horse to Joe's."}, {"review_id": "ypF66nZulPbQp7k0IKVGwg", "user_id": "zPZtB17HvBnE4UTFvInuAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2017", "text": "Oh my goodness that was good!!!

Here is why.This is what I ordered: Cowboy Plate- Sliced brisket, Creamy Coleslaw, Beans,  bread, pickle, onions and bbq sauce. This is what I actually got when I sat down and opened my to go bag:Sliced brisket, beans, bbq sauce and 1 small piece of bread. I was missing my coleslaw, pickle and onion. I paid full price for half of a meal. Once I got over the fact I was missing half of my food that I ordered I ate and it was okay at best. The brisket had no smoke ring and was a gray color. It was nothing special. The beans had way to much brown sugar in them they reminded me of an apple pie due to this. The white bread was plain white bread. Service was not much better. My husband called in our order and when he got there they acted as if he never called. At no point did they ask him what sides he had ordered or anything. With the mediocre food, bad service and limited hours I will take my business elsewhere in the future."}, {"review_id": "hGu2XuhpLCfi5IRBlMxnhg", "user_id": "OG6q40EnCDY6JSHDmatOmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "What a relief!

When we got there we found there was no menu, just someone there to rattle off what they had that day. It was noon and they were already out of brisket. We ordered and waited quite a while for our food to arrive. They came out and brought my husband his plate of pulled pork and asked us if that was everything. No- clearly it is not as I don't have any food. We told them what we ordered and they came back and read off what they had put in for our order. It wasn't even close. I ended up with a \"loaded\" baked potato- I guess \"loaded\" means a plain potato with pulled pork on top. My husband's pulled pork was half fat and skin, and the potato salad was terrible. There were only 2 staff working, one of whom seemed to be preoccupied with being on the phone and smoking cigarettes.

They are out of chicken today unfortunately.I won't talk about service, ambiance, parking, etc. because we are here for the FOOD.Meat in tacos are cold, I don't like the tacos at all. I had to add a lot of sauce in the tacos because they have no flavor at all. I expected more.The ribs on the other hand, delicious. Falls off the bones when you bite on it, along with the bbq sauce, great match. Half pound ribs is four pieces, $7.Oh, their sweet tea is really good, got one free refill I think.I would come back if I crave for bbq, but stick with the MEAT. I see a lot of people eating bbq sandwiches and it doesn't look great either. When people add stuff to meat, it got all complicated and the flavor just won't add up sometimes.But, what I like may not be what you like. Eat whatever you want.UPDATE: I had this lunch about 10 hours ago, and I still feel full, I drink so much water today and still feel thirsty. I haven't had anything else since the lunch at Joe's. I think it is the sweet tea."}, {"review_id": "JjNWIKQNYex5V1XbwSAJTQ", "user_id": "Pi5jFU1YjGwiMivpI4gz2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2017", "text": "I hate to review this because it feels like a wonderful secret spot for BBQ aficionado's.
