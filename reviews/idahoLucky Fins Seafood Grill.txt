The interior is very modern, and I LOVE the high up tables / chairs. My seating preference here is in the room to the left, once you walk into the first floor entrance. It's naturally lit, huge windows, and of course has the high bar chairs / tables that I love. That room also has 2 TVs, along with the TVs you can still see at the bar area. Every time I came here, I made sure to come during happy hour (3PM - 6PM M-F, ALL DAY SUNDAY). The Calamari is pretty good, the overall size of what you get is kind of small, but for $7 I'm not complaining. The sushi here is tasty, presentation is very nice. I'm not a sushi snob (I just love all food lol), and I enjoy the sushi you can buy at Winco. Comparing Winco's sushi to the sushi here, I'd say you can definitely tell the increase in taste and quality at Lucky Fin's, but the overall price per value isn't as good as Winco's, IMO. Still, I enjoyed the sushi here VERY much, and paired with the great atmosphere, natural lighting, and friendly staff, it's almost a home run.I'm kind of picky as to which place I give 5 stars to. This place is a strong 4. The only big negative that's preventing me from giving a 5 is just the overall price. If the pricing was slightly lowered (doesn't have to be permanent, but perhaps a higher discount during happy hour), this place would be 5 stars easy.If you're a soup person, I STRONGLY recommend the Roasted Poblano & Jalapeno Cream Soup. It's very tasty, and has the right amount of spice. I'd also recommend the calamari (during happy hour), it's just a little finger food to start you off and get you in the right mood. There's ALOT of sushi choices, but I prefer the hot / toasted ones (not exactly sure what the correct terminology is). Overall, the interior vibe, natural lighting, high up tables / chairs, and the food / presentation are all great pros here. The pricing is just a little high, but it's definitely not going to stop me from coming here again in the future."}, {"review_id": "ixHBN88Mn72odtGPeue3iQ", "user_id": "b8ha2HpKu7u2XtSmqndAHw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "First time eating here, service was great.  I ordered a cup of Clam Chowder and the Baja Salad.

We sampled an appetizer, salad , soup and sushi all washed down with a healthy sized bloody Mary.  Everything was super tasty.

Fish and chips and shrimp fried in canola oil instead of soybean oil???!!!! Yes please!!! The restaurant is beautiful and the drinks were so delicious. I had a strawberry lemonade martini that was so great. It was one of the truly great drinks where the memory of the flavors linger on days after in your mind. Our waitress was patient and accommodating. They even added a bun to my seafood platter so that I could make a sandwich with my fish. Everything was fresh and tasty. What I loved is that even though my meal was fried, it didn't have that overly greasy oily taste.  Their lobster tater tots are also delicious. The only thing that stinks is that they got rid of heir all you can eat crab special. Bring that back Lucky Fins!!!"}, {"review_id": "tIQlcAF7C9qC5TemLjcwYA", "user_id": "86aYa8EVV1GakNvUmp6AUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Amazing amazing food! And great customer service! My friend had ordered the salmon Cesar salad and it hadn't come out the same time as everyone else's food so the manager came to our table and offered us something to hold us over. We had considered ordering the lobsters tater tots and without hesitation he got it for us! It was very good! Then once her food finally came out he came back to our table and offered us free desert! It wasn't even that big of a deal to us but he was so generous and nevertheless the food was delicious! Would definitely come back for more!"}, {"review_id": "e_iZ70L3BnVpVW8NrahPIQ", "user_id": "e_9jRYH2xAGnw8PrjATjPA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "All my husband want for his birthday was fish and family.

This place was the bomb!!! I would drive to Idaho again just to eat here. Ha! My husband and I were starving, more like hangry! Long story short we ended up here as a second choice as the first one fell through with a two hour wait! We had a long drive and we're tired. So we found this online and went for it! So glad we did. We got there and it was packed and they were doing a big Christmas party too! Ended up only having to wait 45 mins, not bad for a Saturday night in a big city/ town. While we were waiting the manager passed out a sample of their appetizer, a crab stuffed mushroom, oh my freaking yum! He apologized for the wait and thanked us for our patience. It was beyond our expectations and was a great touch to amazing service we got the entire time we were there. They had a special the crab stuffed halibut with brocolini and risotto. Holy crap out of this world delicious!!! I think I could have stuffed my face with two of these dishes! My husband had the  blackened ribeye , fresh veggies and mashed potatoes. Holy crap good too!! The steak had such great flavors and tender. The veggies were so good and fresh! We also had out of this world bread pudding and a key lime pie! I had a wonderful bloody Mary with shrimp, crab legs, blue cheese stuffed olives. They gave me extra crab for waiting. It was freshly cooked too! The service and atmosphere was perfect! We left so super happy and keep talking about this place. Can't wait to have a chance to go back again! A must go to!!"}, {"review_id": "dOdlAruDKVpo25pUHwt5FA", "user_id": "IcDtCa2pJCOPruYGBnz7rQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "One of the best seafood meals I've had in Boise.  We had the Diablo Roll- great combination of smooth, crunchy, hot and sweet.

The drinks are done very well and atmosphere is great. It's hard to find places that fry foods in canola oil, if you have a soy bean allergy this is the only oil you can eat, and they use canola oil therefore all the fried food is fair game which made my best friend extactic since she almost never gets to have fish n chips. I can not however give it 5 stars because they discontinued their all you can eat crab on Wednesday and Sunday which means I'll probably go there less often."}, {"review_id": "r6PXLOsUpl7W3HFErebCew", "user_id": "kRidX_BZGVFqn47dNSC8GA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "This restaurant has THE BEST food!

My husband and I also split a couple sushi rolls and thought they were great. (I'm pregnant so we were only able to eat cooked fish rolls; I'm looking forward to trying their raw sushi when I can).Service was fast and very friendly. Attentive, but not overbearing. The decor was a strange compromise of super hip and grandparent-friendly. There's a nautical theme going on, but it's unclear of whether they're going for a modern, eclectic sushi vibe, or an old-timey fisherman feel. Overall a very positive experience. Unless your dining experience is based on an establishment's light fixtures, you'll enjoy your visit."}, {"review_id": "6vwcyX9JXA8tEpu_mf-_ug", "user_id": "dJcydaBlE5E98XPqACmrsg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "The quality of the fried selections left a lot to be desired.
