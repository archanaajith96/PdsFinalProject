We wanted to try some delicious southern BBQ and we found just the perfect place for it. After some searching on Yelp, we decided to come here for lunch. It was pretty busy during lunch hour and go even busier after we started eating. You have so many items to choose from here. I though the fried chicken, fried gizzards, sausage, and hush puppies tasted fantastic. I had 2 full plates. My mom is in love with their hush puppies. Very impressed with Little Pigs. I only wish I could come back here a few more times so that I can have the opportunity to try everything. The buffet price is very reasonable. You probably can't find a place with cheaper prices. Your options are fantastic. The staff are friendly and keep the restaurant clean. The hot food line was consistently filled. Good drink options too. Fresh brewed iced tea always makes me happy. Note: maybe it's just because I'm from California, but they could be more eco friendly. You'll notice plastic forks, knives, spoons....along with styrofoam plates, bowls and cups. Maybe it's cheaper than having real dishes? Definitely noticed this the minute I walked into the restaurant. I'd still eat here again though. We all left happily stuffed."}, {"review_id": "9m-F2l5CCbbWFy85myQp3Q", "user_id": "b7dSpL9HXpUHAUN1KM55Pw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "If you ever felt terrible or guilty over something you did in the past and need to drown your sorrows but alcohol isn't an option then look no further then little pigs. All you can eat fried chicken and a bunch of other stuff. But for me it's all about the fried chicken. If you really need to beat yourself up and have a good cry doing it then come to little pigs. Something about this place is just magical, whether it's the fact that you will absolutely regret eating this much fried chicken tomorrow or the constipation you will definitely have there is a bit of comfort that somehow someone else in that restaurant is feeling worse than you are right now. I love little pigs because the name is adorable, the food is delicious, and when I break out into tears no one questions it. Just business as usual."}, {"review_id": "ypbgR3qJq59lyN_B1BEHfA", "user_id": "DUEdblSXOHgiKbJTxjuHbA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/19/2017", "text": "My family raves about this place but it just didn't cut it for me. I ordered fried chicken (super greasy on the outside & DRY on the inside), macaroni & cheese (again, dry - so dry that it wasn't even fused together), yams (not much taste at all) and sweet corn. I did enjoy the hush puppies, but that's about it. Hmmm, maybe I just went on a bad day? Or perhaps I'm just not the biggest fan of southern food anymore, but this was overall pretty disappointing. The staff was really nice and they prepared our large take-out order pretty quickly. Thankfully it was less than $10! Considering I have family down here, I'll probably try this place again in the future because they eat here so often."}, {"review_id": "pkNnDfDfsYI3HYCOSgQEsw", "user_id": "xWzrfubmvqdTzU28DC2TYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Love this place.

Greens were sweet, and Mac n cheese needed more salt and cheese. Mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box. I had enough for three separate meals, so it was all a great value. Everything was pretty basic though, and none of what I tried blew me away.

There was a good selection of food. From sides, to meats, and desert. My favorite has to be the fried chicken and hush puppies. Omg the hush puppies were amazing especially when it came out fresh. I loved the hot sauce and BBQ sauce that they provided on the tables as well. I couldn't stop eating because I kept wanting to dip everything into the hot sauce.

The other meats were just okay. I was not all that impressed with the sides, they were pretty standard buffet-type sides. The price for the buffet is super reasonable, so it's definitely a good value for what you are getting. The place is really busy, and the staff is a little rude. Overall a solid option for BBQ in the area. I would say more of 3.5 stars. I would prefer to pay a little more and drive a bit farther to go to Shealys...but this is a good stop if you're close by.

I tried to sample most things, but I think the BBQ pork in red sauce, as well as the whole pig was my favorite from the BBQ portion. What I REALLY digged was the chicken pot pie!!!! Something about the thick gravy and the awesome crisp crust had me going back for seconds. The tomato pie was equally as delicious, and was kind of spiced like a pizza. Everything from the sides section was good, I liked the coleslaw, mac n cheese, and potato salad. For dessert, I tried both the banana pudding and chocolate delight (chocolate pudding + Nilla wafers, I think) and both were simple, but a nice end to the meal.If you're on a long road trip, this is totally a great spot to check out if you don't want to waste too much time in a restaurant, but still want a nice meal with lots of selection."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-pigs-barbecue-columbia?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
