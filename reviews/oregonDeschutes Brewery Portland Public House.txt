Mixed?  I don't know, it was awesome), the raspberry sour (love sours, this one was perfect), and their saison.Waitstaff, hostesses, etc were super friendly.  There's an option to sit in the seat-yourself bar section. We opted to wait to get the full table, but they have tons of seating in the bar and it seemed to turn over quickly.  BTW if you're struggling for parking, the garage directly across from Deschutes is $5."}, {"review_id": "vgI2US--tltbDoHv1SzM-A", "user_id": "povvfHblniE-5IT_Bwe0qA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "They carry a yummy gluten free beer and the service was fantastic! yay!

It's obviously massive and really well known so it is expected that it will be crowded. But it was really packed and a bit uncomfortable. The service was not good either. We sat at the bar thinking they'd be helpful and knowledgeable and they barely spoke to us when we were asking about beers, likely because they were busy but still a bummer.

The cheese wasn't that sharp so it ended up being a bit bland after a couple bites of the flavorful burger. The portion size is massive so be sure to share that bad boy. The flight came with a good mix of ales and for the most part, they were pretty good.  It's funny to picture this place as a brewery because the machinery of the place is more like a restaurant, but in any case, be sure to try both the food and the drinks!"}, {"review_id": "lM5qY7udlAcwRVZg7xlhtA", "user_id": "1pSDflGFEmvyB0YQjs-goQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/16/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We have been regular, local supporters of Deschutes since they opened... and of the beer years prior. The food is top notch, with special love for their crab roll.  Deschutes staff are always super friendly, attentive, informed and welcoming. This evening, a totally inappropriate, technically illegal and super rude hostess to dropped my 4.5 stars to a 2. She made a huge scene objectifying my service dog, who has come in with me multiple times a month since Deschutes opened many years ago. I confirmed he is a certified service dog and we are regulars.  She carried on and said not all certified service dogs are allowed only some tiers. She said companion dogs and emotional support dogs are not welcome and she needed to know the details of my medical condition. For management's reference, this lady had a long-ish dark ponytail and was up front. The manager was very cool to listen and address the situation, however I am not interested in having any variety of this experience again. We normally overlook the high volume of tourists and suburbanites here to have to consistent delicious food, beer and great service. However, this is a sad day of not tolerating discrimination by a staff member at a restaurant. Our family (my husband, dog and I) have invested a LOT of $$$ and support over the years and are truly bummed for our ship to sail to other favorites."}, {"review_id": "5BghOClOGyMsG6DtBklTfg", "user_id": "aPe3uyDXSps0Grt7lchXAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Great place to have simple but well prepared food and a nice selection of beer.  Since we ate a snack late in the afternoon, for dinner my wife and I ordered the Brewery Board (assortment of cheese, fruits, and cold cuts), Pub Burger, and a flight of beer sampler.  We loved everything, from the quality and taste of the food to the variety of the beer to the vibe in the restaurant.The service we got from Dante was top notch.  The place was super busy but that didn't stop him from being friendly and informative about the menu, as well as nearby art galleries.Even though it's a pub style restaurant, it's a family friendly atmosphere so there were plenty of kids on a Saturday night.  We did have to wait around 45 minutes for a table so be prepared to have a beer, better yet, just engage someone in an interesting conversation, in the waiting area.  We found everyone super friendly during our visit to Portland."}, {"review_id": "LWVdaJ152mrLiUNNt1iQ9Q", "user_id": "Y5UhsObZ8q1BThzm5MtWVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "I feel like there are already so many wonderful reviews of Deschutes, but I also feel the need to share what a wonderful experience I had here! My boyfriend and I went to Deschutes during Zwickelmania 2018, which is essentially a day to celebrate local breweries. We had great beer, delicious food and a fun tour of Deschutes behind the scenes. Deschutes only does the brewery tour during this special event every year, so we were glad to have been in town as it was going on! When we arrived at the restaurant we were sure we'd have to wait because it looked crowded, but they got us a seat in under 10 minutes. For lunch I had the salmon chowder and he had the short rib sandwich. Both of our meals were flavorful and paired wonderfully with our taster board of beers. After lunch, we went to the back of the restaurant for a tour- which again, is only available during Zwickelmania. The brewmaster was friendly and the free beer samples were much appreciated! I would highly recommend stopping at Deschutes for a meal or a few beers, especially if it's during Zwickelmania!"}, {"review_id": "ii_YIwTpU4a8h5EcQ_0XTw", "user_id": "ObSXluQeEYiOP9l9muFlGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Of all the beer flights I had in Portland (and there were quite a many) the one I had here at big, touristy Deschutes was the best.

Pour me a big glass of something dark any day.I could go on and on, but it's been said already about this place. If you're vegan just come for the fantastic beers and venture on to the many other places in Portland that actually care about providing quality plant-based eats.

I might also have had a better impression of the location itself if I'd been there at a time other than Saturday night in the thick of it, because it was *packed*. Maybe that's your thing, but it wasn't mine - it's an absolutely enormous space, yes, but at least when I was there, that space was just *jammed* with people. Could barely hear anything over the bustle of it all - I definitely prefer a more laid-back beer tasting, and this was anything but. Anyway, it was on my list, as everyone was raving about it, so I popped in and had one beer at the bar (or rather, standing awkwardly near the bar, because all the seats were taken). Most of the beer on their list also looked super mainstream, and I tend to prefer more experimental sorts of things, so I tried the one interesting thing on their list, a \"thai-inspired sour with lemongrass and chile\". It... pretty much just tasted like a beer. Very subtle lemongrass, and not really any pepper kick to speak off. It wasn't terrible, but it was pretty underwhelming."}, {"review_id": "eaZfN-AJPh0zwmrsZoK8xw", "user_id": "yzV3mXtCnQggGLQEK8YWAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Came here on my first night in Portland.

I have never been impressed with their commercial beers, I think they are bland, and I prefer almost anything else. When you visit the brewery, though, they have about 3 times the number of beers you would recognize! Some of them are quite expensive, but there were plenty of interesting options at a reasonable price. I'm now a believer in them as brewers, even if I'll pass on their items in the store.The restaurant is quite large. We were seated pretty quickly and had to come to grips with the large beer selection. Once we finished that, we split the \"pig wings\" and the \"bacon and blue salad\". The sauce on the pig wings was amazing, and the meat was moist and delicious. The salad had plenty of toppings for the both of us.

The beer sampler comes with six different choices on beer that you get to choose! My personal favorites were the Grapefruit Fusion Flower Session Sour and the Fruit Boots NE IPA. If you like beers with fruity and clean flavors, definitely check these kinds out! My boyfriend enjoyed the Black Butte Porter (think dark, chocolatey, and coffee) and the Pacific Wonderland which had a really clean and crisp aftertaste. The customer service was very friendly.
