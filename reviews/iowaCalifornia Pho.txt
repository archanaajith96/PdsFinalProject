However...BAD service. My meal came 20 minutes before my husband's meal.  Looking around, the meals were just coming out randomly to tables whenever they were ready, with no regard to whether or not other plates were ready.  The waitress even came by 15 minutes into my (and only mine, since hubby was still waiting) meal, and asked us how we were doing and if everything was good.  I remarked about his missing food.  She was unconcerned.  When his food finally came out, there were no apologies offered, or even a recognition of how lame it was that they weren't even close in time to each other.The owner seemed really nice.The place was nice enough but didn't feel entirely clean."}, {"review_id": "XSh8dHvr4le0SKReoFpovA", "user_id": "gSmH1yVMPZFM0mrmD4uq4Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "My boyfriend and I went for a early lunch. First let me let you know they had good reviews. It was a disappointing when I ate there today. When we first came in and sat down we placed and order and the waiter said it would be 10 minutes before the cook came back. They ended up making are order and not having the cook. I questioned it but what ever we ordered anyway. I was very disappointed one the soup was not very hot. They forgot the beans sprouts. I had to ask and the waiters response was they didn't have a cook. They should of told us to come back another time. I love pho... on top of it the public health inspector was there at the place. If you don't have a cook you shouldn't take orders. Plus, we had to ask for more water. I'm not for sure what was going on but by far one of the worst pho experiences I've had ever. I had 2 bites and that was it. The kid gave me a free coffee because of not having a cook. I feel like I should of had a full refund what a waste of money."}, {"review_id": "74d0YaW-K9tWmivTAdLDJg", "user_id": "pk9AMhzP2Elx6LGU0UeO5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "Nothing better than a flavorful bowl of pho on a cold winter day . California Pho wrapped me in a large warm blanket and sent me on my way. They provide such generous portions. My friend upgraded to a large size because it was 1$ more and it was way more than enough. I love pairing my pho with egg rolls and these egg rolls did not disappoint. The menu stated 3.99$ for 2 pieces and I ended up getting 3 pieces each sliced in half which was also more than I expected to receive. Needless to say, come to California Pho hungry and ready to eat. The restaurant appears to be a mom and pop shop, but their venue is spacious in size. Perfect for large events like family gatherings."}, {"review_id": "DA0KZerodYLoniRACjgDJw", "user_id": "cKpj95CVl3WuaiB7i4JipA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "as soon we walked in a man, maybe owner, greeted us and had a great personality and was super friendly.

Recently added to that growing list is California Pho in west Davenport. As a vegetarian, I was wary of Vietnamese cuisine since it oftentimes includes meat. A fellow veg friend told me to try out this place because of its vegetarian Pho, so my husband and I went here for lunch. We each had the veg Pho, which was served piping hot in a GINORMOUS bowl (seriously huge). Fresh veggies topped the soup, including broccoli that must have been quickly stir fried (?) and allowed to continue to cook in the broth. Genius. Who wants soggy broccoli?! We also ordered veg spring rolls (handmade) that came with a yummy peanut sauce. Bonus? Chopsticks and sauces already on the table!Oh- about that broth: light, delectable, simple. I've made veggie broth before, and it's a time-consuming process much like chicken or beef (but without the bones that tend to add lots of flavor). The owner - such a kind man - came to talk to us and said they cook it for hours. That's apparent! It's my new comfort food for sure!!"}, {"review_id": "mdOZRyZEYkIBPxE5pzjG8w", "user_id": "yp4AJk6bWhUTV3SgXF5FlA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Absolutely delicious!

The food was fabulous! We had a really good, simple pho dish with chicken (my elderly mother is not adventurous); the filled \"crêpe\" dish (really more like a paper-thin, crisp omelette), filled with shrimp, was out of this world. It comes with lettuce leaves to serve as wrappers, and plenty of basil and cilantro to put inside, with the crêpe. Another dish we had: grape leaves filled with a rice and ground beef mixture. It was a very clever appropriation of the Greek dish, served hot with the usual sweet/sharp Vietnamese sauce on the side. My wife and I also had cold rice noodles with various aromatic veggies: basil, cilantro, mung bean sprouts, as well as grilled shrimp, fried spring rolls, and grilled pork as toppings. It was perfect.We've had Vietnamese food in Washington, Paris, Marseille, Chicago, and other cultural capitals. This was as good as anything we've had out there in the wide world. The menu is extensive, and we're probably going to stop here every Thanksgiving until we are too old to make the trip any more.I am so curious how the family that owns the restaurant came to land in the quad cities area. I suspect their story is the stuff from which novels spring."}, {"review_id": "nQTNfIcHTPcv-yUeiVP6sw", "user_id": "v1RxzjjIQmzuFE4bPl7mQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "We love the egg rolls!!

Chicken pho was fine, could use more anise flavor.My go-to meal when I'm sick is pho - and I was happy to find this restaurant with high reviews listed - AND with delivery options to Bettendorf when my boyfriend became sick while we were home for Thanksgiving. We ordered the California Special Pho (with rare beef tenderloin) and Chicken Pho. When the meal arrived (on time) the chicken pho was great with a generous portion of chicken, excellent accompanying basil, onions, sprouts, peppers, limes and Sriracha at request. However, the rare beef in the California Special Pho arrived, raw, bloody and partially frozen - and the blood leaked out of the plastic wrap when we took it out to cook it. We were expecting seared beef tenderloin that was rare - what we got was strips of cheap raw beef you would cook for a Philly cheese stake sandwich. Disgusting. Probably not up to health code to sell and deliver raw, bloody beef. Stay away from this dish. The chicken is fine. Not sure I would go out of my way to dine in or pay for deliver from this restaurant again."}, {"review_id": "Jt1HmKaeQbDhZ4Tvs2eEDA", "user_id": "Pc6v-ku9xCs5ASXiHbjTtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/29/2017", "text": "Our experience here was outstanding, it's clean, open, and the menu is abundant.
