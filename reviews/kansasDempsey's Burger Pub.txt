It's a neat little place with a nice atmosphere, but the food is very lacking. The burgers are fairly flavorless, poor in texture (all soft, no crispy), probably in the 10th percentile of burgers I've had.The fries were also poor. They tasted quite off. There was something seriously wrong with them, though I couldn't quite put my finger on it."}, {"review_id": "lLuhqnzzTnXkfJonZYL8nQ", "user_id": "av4YPHxqu_h4vk7mjyVj5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "Great burgers, Greta fries.I particularly liked the excellent service and friendly staff though.

My sister and I have been here many times and the service and food is always excellent. We ordered our food to go and were an hour late because we ordered at the wrong place. I paid for the food and the worker said that I shouldn't eat the food since we had ordered it an hour earlier. He said that the restaurant didn't want us to eat bad food and he had our order remade and he even offered me a drink. This was one of the freshest to go food I've ever had and I would definitely recommend this place. I ordered the egg burger and sweet potato fries and the burger was very juicy and the egg was well done. The sweet potato fries were crispy and the sauces that went along with it was amazing. My sister ordered sliders and I've had those before and it was very delicious and filling for a slider. She also ordered a side of truffles which were very crispy and flavorful. I definitely recommend the burgers and the fire fries and duck fat fries!"}, {"review_id": "RsgB-VsC413ZcX44xKdYiw", "user_id": "T-bbNiVDbGVxxdbQX52KTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/29/2017", "text": "I have dreams about the truffle fries here!!This place has great, fresh, unique burgers that are fantastic!  But, I'm telling you, the truffle fries are what dreams are made of...plus they have several dipping sauces to accompany them.  I can't wait to try the duck fat fries, but I have a problem going there and not getting the truffle fries!The parking in this area can be a bit challenging, but you'll be glad you came!"}, {"review_id": "RnPrOCXuI7JMMHv0lh5V0Q", "user_id": "wVihJ3hzYUT4TIBfb_5v8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "This place fills you up right!   It only do they give you a lot of food for the price but they give you some of the best tasting food!  Try any of their fry varieties or burger varieties and you're sure to love any and all of it!"}, {"review_id": "ABfyMr-9uRnNTXcRMlu5eA", "user_id": "wMMXzg1RmqWOm9uMpky5fA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "I think I quite possibly had the best burger of my life today. Me and the hubs went in before doing The Escape Room upstairs and we're in a bit of a rush. Our server, Paige, was very understanding, friendly and overall on point! I ordered the Hawaiian Kobe burger (medium rare-and it came as ordered) and I was almost in shock at what I was tasting. Best burger I can ever remember. The spicy pineapple chutney was the perfect touch on top of a juicy flavorful burger with a pretzel bun. I ate the whole thing like it was nothing! The truffle fries were also amazing. Will be back for sure!!"}, {"review_id": "rAMtTdudn1W3_1uV2cY2yA", "user_id": "PB-ArOsLYOZcik6Oxjjqiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "This place hands down has the best burgers in Wichita!

It is located in the Clifton Square in College Hill.  But what many first timers don't know is that you really have two types of dining styles: 1. Main level is more casual (however in the summer may be a little bit more toasty since this is where the kitchen is at) with your traditional style seating and 2. Basement is more of your laid back bar scene with tv's. So depending on what you're looking for I recommend you check both out!Service is always wonderful, from the host/hostess, to the bartender, to the waiter/waitress. Most of the time they are very knowledgeable about the regular and season beer.  Food always gets to us within a reasonable time.Now, on to taste, this is a burger pub. So I obviously recommend the burgers! Specifically, my favorite, Picante Burger. It is amazing!!! Always cooked to perfection! Overall I just really like the atmosphere of this place (especially downstairs)! Also, FYI the horseshoe parking lot is a PAIN! I usually do one lap and find something on the side streets!"}, {"review_id": "sRAZUafGJIZKwxLo_yfP1g", "user_id": "brmrB2ZaBXzoY0BYiIS8rA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Excellent food!  Great pub atmosphere.  I love the delicious french fries and choices of dipping sauce.  This is just an all around great place"}, {"review_id": "ymsidr8UGIAoLqzUFibRnQ", "user_id": "g2JhotmK-Dx6PFCRCebgVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2017", "text": "I was in town visiting family and my family suggested we check out Dempsey's.I loved the little area the place resides in - super cute and village like!We got there just after 5 on a weekday and it was already hoppin'! We were sat downstairs and had a fun time.Our server was extremely nice and attentive.This place is definitely a laid back younger crowd vibin' place. It is hopping with energy and a lot of fun laughing and people surrounding you.We got a couple different versions of the fries, truffle, and duck. They were both fantastic to try and have fun with. They each come with a few different fun dips too! The bacon trio looked superb as well, but we passed on that this time around.I ordered the burger salad and it was outstanding. The burger patty was cooked perfectly and its taste was amazing. Not sure what they season it with, but job well done.Everyone enjoyed their food and time. I would highly recommend this place to others!"}, {"review_id": "jSf6gtJDYnjFaDiLSzG4Rg", "user_id": "fIqlJP6jPQOE3DycrrrnQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Yummy. Burger was juicy and well cooked.  Cooked correctly. Fries were plentiful . Couple of negatives would fall under \"me\". 1. I prefer deli mustard (yellow, plain) and the ketchup was served in those little white cups. However upon request I was able to get enough ketchup to satisfy my needs.

Based on other reviews, I figured I would play it safe and have wings and fries.  I had the hot wings, which were just fine.  Everything a wing needs to be. I had the hot fries.  They were mostly oily and lacked heat.  I wouldn't have them again.  My husband had fish and chips.  By fish they mean , a fish fillet in a bed of fries.  No vinegar served with it.  It was ok.  Definitely, not 'fish and chips'.  This is burger joint though, shame on him for ordering fish. The rest of the party had burgers and I noticed no one really seemed overjoyed with them.  No one finished their fries either.  The sweet potato fries did get a thumps up review.  I'm personally not going back but I have to meet someone there, I would order wings and a drink."}, {"review_id": "cH-Efgh-GAD8p6iAWbIQ9A", "user_id": "7wWuKu6bp1amvfUDK57pUQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "First time and I'd say I would really like to try it again.

The fries are cooked so that they're crispy outside, soft inside, and come with lots of wonderful dips.  My dad got the hot wings and was kind enough to share (they were gluten free) - AMAZING.
