Visiting from out of town and wanted to try the best of what OKC has to offer. We visited Hatch on a Thursday morning and it was quick to be seated. We split the Kitchen Sink plate. It was fantastic! Service is quick and staff is on point. Their menu is extensive and filled with fun terms that you don't normally see on menus back home. Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "TqEtn5F-AGkY5mYDYLskdg", "user_id": "9fb1LjsbTz_YT81CJLTBRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Ehhh... Got the chai latte and that was the best thing about my meal. It was flavorful and strong. Def get this.I didn't like the little tumblers...and I know it's not just me, because I read another review on here that felt similarly. It's just that it's like made with sour cream on the inside? It didn't add ANY flavor, so it was like wasting calories on something that wouldn't add difference to the taste. I was excited to try this- so I'm annoyed that it was a let down. Also had the hatch cheeseburger- again, no flavor!! I asked for ranch and all they had was this hot sauce, so that was irritating. I also got a side of the blueberry pancake. It's REALLY sweet. It was good, but I wish it had been hot. The pancake was kinda cold. For a restaurant that's known to make their food fresh to order, this was a let down.Service was fine- our waitress was nice. The hostess was very annoyed whenever I asked to be seated at another tableI won't come back...if you must go, go to see what the hype is about, but don't have super high expectations. **UPDATE**I went back to Hatch after Taylor, the manager, reached out to me. She told me that their main chef was out the day I came, so that could've been the reason for the lack of umph. Here is my honest review: their food IS fresh. And any restaurant that serves fresh food automatically gets a higher review. However, I still feel like it was missing something. There was nothing that really stood out to me (in regards to any unique flavor). However, I liked my dish better this time, and do think their ingredients are solid. I would still recommend the chai tea latte (very excellent), I got their mission street tacos and tried flour, corn, and their own style which is a flash fried way. I liked the flour and flash fried. I also really liked the fresh guacamole. I got a side of fruit, which was good. My partner got the Denver omelette and fruit. It was a normal omelette, but we loved that it had thick ham (something that's different since most restaurants use deli ham). The service was on point (although, I didn't really have a problem with this in my first visit). Our waitress was attentive and sweet. Taylor personally made an effort to take care of us and was so bubbly and kind. Would I come back? Probably. I'd probably try a different thing on their menu. The service is excellent, the vibe is perfect to bring out of towners, and again, the food is fresh. Is this the top brunch place in okc? Not sure- I'll have to continue my search."}, {"review_id": "sJyWjEs6zTszqiaN5x_HnQ", "user_id": "esoF28a_J7UhbVC0tIjDXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "My favorite meal is breakfast.

Hatch, and their manager, Taylor, did just that. With a restaurant that has so many reviews, I was expecting my one bad review to be brushed off but Taylor took it by the reins, and wouldn't let it go. It's remarkable and I have so much respect for Hatch now. Thank you. Our food was, well, remarkable. I think my first review reflected a time with short staff, a lot of miscommunication happening at one time, with customers lining up out the door. It's understandable, I knew that when writing my first review but I wanted Hatch to be aware of how customers sitting down may have felt. The warmth that radiated from the staff reflected to the warmth of the food. Despite the current rainy day, I was in OKC heaven. Their orange glazed croissants are in-cred-ible. And there's so many of them! This would be perfect just by itself for kiddos with an order of scrambled eggs. They make them to order, and the freshness is obvious. Perfect amount of chewy and fluffy.It's no secret that my morning gets started as soon as the coffee starts flowing. It's just not a very good idea for me to try anything productive until I've had at least three or four sips of my liquid gold in the mornings. Their coffee was smooth, didn't require much creamer, and their mocha is to die for! (And Beautiful) Hatch, I'll be back. And I'm so happy I've found one of my favorite restaurants. Take note I'm still surprised at their kindness, attentiveness to my previous review. This is a place that CARES, which is hard to find now and days."}, {"review_id": "pbR4Nrctd0_wng4R1BhP_Q", "user_id": "cVBG-OvjCFzf3PLbL0eLfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Not a bad first visit...

FOOD: We've come here several times but every time I come I've tried something new. I don't think I've found a favorite only because everything has been so delicious. A couple highlights: The Kitchen Sink! The pancakes and the latte! Not only are they beautiful but they're also delicious. I will say that they pack on the pancakes so if you're sensitive to sugar I'd stay away. I could only have so much. SERVICE: Very friendly and hospitable service. Getting a Saturday/Sunday morning table is tough because it's such a popular spot. I recommend you make a reservation. Last time we went we sat outside, there were heaters so it worked out. LOCATION/ATMOSPHERE: Family friendly but also a younger vibe. It's a long restaurant with ample space but I could see it being difficult to get a massive table here. There's a nice patio area - tiny - so don't count on that too much. It seats maybe 3-4 tables. Will I come back?

We were all served coffee right away which is always a plus. The great thing about going to a restaurant with close friends is that everyone is willing to share meals. We got a side of the famous PanOKCake which was yummy! I really enjoyed the egg sandwich; I thought all of the flavors went well together. I probably would've gone without the hashbrown tumblers only because I'm not the biggest fan of fried foods--they're good, but I was ok with just eating one. I can't say much for the burrito other than expect to have enough food for another 2 meals unless you're super hungry; it's huge! I wish the avocado toast was, well, toasty. Instead, it was more like borderline soggy bread from the hollandaise sauce.The service was decent at the beginning, but towards the end of our meal, it felt like we were forgotten even though it still didn't seem too busy.

I even showed up earlier than my reserved time just to be safe. By the time I got there (around 10:45AM), they were already at a 2-3 hour wait time for walk ins. Definitely the way to go is either through the No Wait App online OR going to the first-come first-serve communal tables for small groups. I figured on a Saturday that it'd be crazy, even if I was eating solo, so I tried the app. I actually waited 5 mins more than I had been told on the app, so it wasn't too bad. I was able to figure out exactly what I wanted before getting seated.In downtown OKC there's a lot of construction going on, which closes off a lot of nearby streets. Fortunately, there are a plethora of parking garages and lots in the area, so you never have to fight for spaces. Also, a full day's charge is $5, which is a steal compared to other major cities. Besides the construction, the downtown area is easily walkable. Now, after scouring the Yelp reviews and photos for the most popular breakfast items, I got:-Fried chicken eggs-Hash brown tumblers-Famous PanOKCake-Chicken and WafflesFrom all of my photos, you can tell there's a theme of fried, processed starches throughout the whole meal. I'm just one person and I got some of it to go afterwards. All-in-all, I had small critiques of each dish:Fried chicken eggs: though they were soft boiled eggs, the batter they were fried in was a touch too salty. You'd have to dip it in some sauce to counter the taste, but regardless, I ate all 3 of the eggs before my meal.Hash brown tumblers: these weren't too bad. They're pretty much fried balls of hash browns, which I love, but only a few of them. Very crispy and oily.Famous PanOKCake: I thought ordering a side of this would still result in a pancake the shape of Oklahoma. Sadly, no. It was interesting with the bourbon maple glaze as I live somewhat on the Bourbon Trail now. The saltiness of the bacon pecans offsets the pancake itself. This was probably my favorite dish.Chicken and waffles: The crispness of the fried chicken was unreal. As in I tried to cut through and chunks flew off the table and onto my lap. The chicken breast wasn't too thick so the majority is fried batter...which is still good, but has no substance underneath it. The waffles are your regular waffles. It's good together, but if the fried chicken were a little bit better, I'd be impressed.Overall, I think my selection of dishes to try were what swayed my review more than the wait. I tried a few of their popular dishes, but wasn't really impressed. Perhaps if I tried others it would deemed worthy of the 2-3 long wait that other customers deemed worth it. Sorry to be that person, but I don't think it was worth the hype others had put on this place."}, {"review_id": "WKbNHt-c-R0e6RwvYdyylg", "user_id": "z6t9DCU6GyhhRlc7-hr78A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Dropped in for a quick bite.

My sister got the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The soup was pasty. My mom got the eggs benedict and she ate every bite, so it must have been amazing!

They tell you from the beginning that anybody working there can help you with whatever you may need, which is nice and made me feel welcomed. The food is a different story. The food is a bit pricey and not as great as it looks. The presentation of the food was fantastic, but the overall taste was average.

I love the high ceilings and natural light, and seeing the open kitchen! Great service from the get go.We ordered a matcha latte, salmon eggs Benedict, and the Cuban sandwich. We saw an order of croquettes go by and salivated so we put in an order for that too. It all happen to come out at the same time, so much food!! The salmon Benedict was pretty good, we ordered the potato tumblers and man, they are so crispy and delicious (but filling)! Cuban sandwich is kind of a fusion, not quite as authentic as some I've had in Miami but stuffed with lots of extra goodies (good luck trying to get a bite of every element at once). There were about 6 croquettes with 3 sauces - a bacon peanut butter, Nutella, and orange glaze. I loved all of them, but the orange glaze was pretty unique.

The food is very good. The server was very attentive and tried to take care of us despite how busy they are. However, when i asked for Ketchup she asked me what would i do with ketchup when I ordered Waffle. Her tone of voice was not very nice. Otherwise the service is very pleasantParking is hectic.

Pancake Flight- coolest thing!  I usually like different flavors of pancakes, so luckily this allowed me to try three different types of pancakes.  I ordered the Famous PanOKcake, standard pancake w/ some nuts and bourban glaze.  Blueberry streusal had some crumbled streusal w/ berries.  Bananas Foster was my FAVORITE, caramelized banana mixed well w/ the sweetness of the sauce and batter.2. Chicken and waffles- pretty tasty!  Waffle batter was light and chicken was lightly battered and marinated well.3. Hatch fried eggs- fried eggs, which were interesting, but I wouldn't order again.  I compared it to a boiled egg that was lightly battered then fried.  4. Loaded tumblers- balled up shredded potatoes w/ some mix-ins.  5. Breakfast burrito- nothing to rave about.  Normal tortilla w/ scrambled eggs and chorizo.  Description made it sound delicious but upon receiving the item, it was MEH.
