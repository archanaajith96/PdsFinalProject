Once my wife and I discovered Salvatore's that became our go to Pizza joint until we moved to Santa Cruz, CA. Typical pick-up order experience. Place order, head over early, order a beer to drink at the bar wait for the pizza to finish. Hang out for a bit. Front staff is super friendly and chill. Helpful & courteous. Choose a 6 pack to-go (not sure if they are still doing this, but they were when I was there), grab the Za and go!  My wife and I dined in a couple times, quaint dining area. Enjoyable. When it is nice outside they will get the tables going out on the sidewalk. The gluten free crust is amazing, don't let this crust pass you by, topped with the works, deluxe style, always. Their sausage, pepperoni, veggies, are all extremely high quality. The pizza is enough for two to share. Morel mushroom pizza is, well, the best pizza I've ever had in my life. I will miss that pizza, a lot.Thanks for the great memories. :)"}, {"review_id": "CFL8zDy2-lRG2xskqssfCQ", "user_id": "UMzVMDf9CVCwbubOnO6Q5A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "3.5 starsMy friend and I got half vegetarian and half fig and bacon. We were a huge fan of the vegetarian, but not so much the fig and bacon. We loved the flavors of the beet pesto and the roasted kale which gave the pizza some nice texture. The fig and bacon pizza wasn't bad, but it lacked some flavor and the pizza ended up being too chewy and hard. I think it needed some greens or citrus to tie the sweet and salty combo. Definitely would recommend the vegetarian pizza. We also ordered the tiramisu which came out frozen like an ice cream cake (but without ice cream). I've always had delicate and spongy tiramisu so we were confused when it came out frozen. My friend and waited 10-15 minutes for it to defrost so it tasted a little better. I would be down to come back and give some of their other pies a try."}, {"review_id": "_bNREpwlUovOz3tpm_w8PA", "user_id": "Ka04Zm9hoy-vfYEzlRIcHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "Great pizza place in Madison!The ingredients are fresh, and the sauce is amazing!

Our server was very nice and apologetic as we ordered wine after wine that they did not have available at the moment. We finally settled on something he suggested that was available.We ordered the burrata and bacon cheese bread for apps. The burrata came served with crostini, greens, cherry tomatoes and whole, roasted garlic cloves. It was amazing! The bacon cheese bread came with a spicy dipping sauce which was also very good.We each ordered a different pizza, and all were delicious (chicken florentine, fat uncle Tony, forza, and two build you own). The crust is what really makes these pizzas. I rarely ever eat crust without it being soaked in garlic butter, but it was hard not to eat every last bite of each piece.They need a larger place, though I suppose that might be some of the \"charm\". Pizza was great, but nothing beats Marcine's, and I'm still on the search for the super thin crust pizza."}, {"review_id": "pYssBsIHuAVHXEHc-lnUJA", "user_id": "2NeBuR2qXcWL9FOS2MYk3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The pizza pies here are amazing and so delicious! Love the farm to table freshness and quality. If you haven't tried Sal's yet, it is well worth it. This place is very family friendly and I have been bringing my family here for years. My family's personal favorite is bacon and goat cheese on a pizza and although it sounds a little strange it tastes delicious!! They even have mini customizable pizzas for kids that are good for older kids too. We recently moved to Minnesota and Sals pizza is still the best we've ever had. You can even see the chefs spinning the pizza into the air and at one of their other locations they have some of the most wonderful calamari. I definitely recommend this place to any body who loves pizza!"}, {"review_id": "a9PJ7sbjPUazWIpPQyZlcw", "user_id": "9brb3jp3oZVIlL5jt4ilCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "Affordable fancy pizza that's made-to-order fresh. Reviews don't lie on this one, definitely a must-go in Madison. What seems like a limited menu actually has a variety of options and it was tough to decide! We took our waiters recommendations and none of them disappointed! Here's our damage -Burrata: veggies and herbs super fresh, the soft cheese was so yummy and spread easy and the crostini was crunchy and warmCarbonara: an egg on every piece - extra gold stars! Got the carbonara creaminess and savory flavor was right on target. Yum, my favorite.Vegetarian: almost a polar opposite as the carbonara but just as delicious. Kale was crispy, the roasted beet pesto was fragrant, and it all came together really nicely. This side was less stable to pick up the slices but we didn't mind.Panna Cotta: presentation was beautiful, fresh fruits and it was a nice consistencyChocolate Cake: perfect pairings with the hazelnut ice cream, pistachios, and caramel sauce. Very yummy.You're able to get 1/2 of each so that was really nice for a party of 2, even though we still had leftovers! They take a lot of pride in serving their best - our first pizza crust was too burnt - the waiter told us right away and we had to wait a little longer, but I liked the honesty. Definitely anticipating coming back :)"}, {"review_id": "bmIU_gunM9yuq9Edp-3pLA", "user_id": "lqoT1tHxzeqF3yuz-ndz-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "THIS PIZZA LOVER WAS IMPRESSED - When a friend told me this place serves \"the best pizza ever,\" I kind of rolled my eyes.  I eat a lot of pizza. And I can be a little picky about it. My husband even more so. Well, I finally got around to trying Salvatore's and OH MY LORD. So delicious!! Even our two year old gobbled it up! Perfect thin crust that's chewy with the perfect amount of crunchiness on the outside. The toppings were amazing! So fresh and flavorful!! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...Additionally, it was SUPER NEAT that they give kids a little cup of goldfish crackers on entry like some restaurants do crayons! So smart and practical and thoughtful and awesome. The vibe was super cool. Loved the little touches like the water served in reusable glass bottles instead of those obnoxious plastic pitchers. I never post reviews. I had to make a new Yelp account to do this. But I was so blown away by the food, the thoughtful treat for my kid, and the cool ambiance that I just had to share.

This place is delicious, no doubt. You can't really go wrong here. Ingredients are fresh. Pizza dough is perfection. Perfectly between thick and thin and perfect doughyness. I heard the table next to us compliment on the gluten free dough, too. We got the bacon cheese bread as the app, which was yummy. Large chunks of thick, crisp bacon. We also got a large half carbonara, half Forza. Forza, while good was pretty tomato-y and had whole pieces of garlic. It would be super good if that's your thing. These pizzas aren't very saucy, but it doesn't make it seem dry tho. Place is also kinda small, so expect to wait.

We went with four people, ordered an appetizer, a small pie, and a large pie. It was basically the correct amount of food, and we wound up taking two slices of the small pizza home. The atmosphere was not great since we spent the whole meal shouting at each other to be heard. The waiting area was too cramped and smiley from the smiley pizza oven. Plus it's a small and cramped eating area. Service was very nice but slow. It was at least five minutes before they brought water to our table and took our order, and food came out slowly.The food was excellent. The burrata appetizer was not great. The vegetables for topping the bread were incredibly fresh, but the ingredients didn't seem to come together well. I think it might have been better if the mozzarella was more flavorful or at least more salty. We ordered the large Carbonara pie without bacon. The crust was delicious and the cheese was outstanding. We all agreed it was a bit too peppery. The daily special pizza was excellent. One of our party was really disappointed, though, that neither pizza had tomato sauce, so beware when you order.Best pizzas in Madison."}, {"review_id": "W_PErWsbuEG5Um4j-_yBsA", "user_id": "NozUVjNR1qMZuUS8zayuqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/30/2016", "text": "Salvatore's is a go in my book! We went during peak dinner times on a Friday, and had about a 30 min wait. It was too muggy for us to want to sit on the patio, but good to know that's an option. The place is quant, which only adds to the charm as long as you don't mind the wait. My two friends and I shared the fig and bacon speciality pizza, with Gorgonzola and wine-poached fig. I've really only eaten fig newtons before, but it was unexpectedly delicious! Not too sweet either! The portion size was bigger then expected, and easily fed the three of us. Our other vegan friend ordered the vegetarian tacos and was a little underwhelmed. I wouldn't go to a pizza place and not order pizza, but hey she seemed pretty satisfied. She commented that the carrots were too big to eat gracefully and it was super messy.
