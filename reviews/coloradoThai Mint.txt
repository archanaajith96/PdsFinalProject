Everything is amazing that we've tried so far. We highly recommend the drunken noodles and pangnang curry! Vegetable egg rolls are also awesome!  What makes them so much better than other places is the use of fresh vegetables and quality meats. You can really taste the difference.

Next was the Pad Ka Prow which does the job but not stellar. The Lad Na did not do it for me. Looks like one of the reviews were right, there were hits and misses.The service was not consistent. Some servers were nice and one had attitude. Whatever, we were just out of towners, and if we were locals we might return. The beef noodle soup warrants a return and also some of the other dishes might be very good. Best to look towards the local reviewers who have a broader perspective of this place."}, {"review_id": "9qVJAMw1o1yEZGGoR4MOpA", "user_id": "UYt5fiS7LUyrJbjNS2Xc1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/19/2017", "text": "You can tell there is something special going on here when you get here at 11:30 on a Monday and the tables are already half full. There are two dishes in which I can determine how much I like a Thai place, Pad Thai and Green Curry and since this was my first trip here, I asked the waitress and she suggested green curry. First, I want to say my food was delivered FAST. I mean, like, less than two minutes fast. The first thing I really loved about the curry was that it was not overwhelmed with potato chunks. That's something that too many Thai places do that ruin the curry for me. I mean, you're already getting rice, so who needs a gigantic ton of potato, too? It had a nice blend of vegetables in with the chicken and the curry. I ordered my curry hot. It was one spoon hot, not two spoon hot (Thai hot). It had just the right amount of heat without overpowering the dish. In one word the curry was fantastic. Now, if I could change one thing I would say that the curry to rice ratio was a little light on the meat and vegetable mixture, though the rice, it was nice to see, was not a gigantic heaping mound, either. I also have to comment on the eggrolls. Yes, it's a little appetizer but OMG! It had thinly shredded cabbage and the dipping sauce was made with honey. Out of this world. I probably could've eaten a whole meal of eggrolls! This place deserves all the five star reviews it has! I left comfortably satisfied but not stuffed full. And for the price of eight dollars for what you got, the meal was spot on."}, {"review_id": "z6EnHruVHsZTrdoHPJnopw", "user_id": "tDNmioQfZkWYHwEJKUenCQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "Just ok. We ordered Shrimp Tom Yum Soup, Chicken Pad Thai, and Chicken Pad Pak with Peanut Sauce; we requested everything to be medium spicy. Customer service was excellent; albeit we took our food to go. It was awesome to be understood and to understand what was said on the other end of the phone with little to no background noise. Our food was ready when we arrived; my hopes were high given the prompt customer service, the reviews on Yelp!, and the fact that they had a full restaurant on a Sunday night. The Tom Yum Soup was great except the shrimp were over cooked and gummy; we thought it was a tad spicy for \"medium\" but still tasted really good. The Pad Thai, while packaged nicely, was bland and far from the \"medium\" spice compared to the Tom Yum Soup. The Pad Pak was the highlight but again, had little to no spice relative to the Tom Yum Soup. Over all, good service, ok food; potential to be excellent if they are consistent in dish quality and spice. Not sure we will make the trip again."}, {"review_id": "g7YBlZlt397-TBz5xslivg", "user_id": "kztwOpP0SW7JztPSYFMsBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "Phenomenal! Wow!

The sauce was unbelievable for the crab wontons! The iced Thai tea's were perfect, and WOW!! Our curries were nothing short of out of this world, full of flavor!
