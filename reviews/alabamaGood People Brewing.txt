If you like hoppy beers, this is your place. And no fear if you aren't a fan of hops, they brew plenty of other light beers and dark beers. They have done alot of renovations and the tap room is now a big, open space with plenty of seating. During the hotter months, they have have an open yard to sit in, socialize, and play some games. Go before a Barons game, go after a stroll through Railroad Park, whatever you do, go!"}, {"review_id": "KH4iYhKrBvhAkyeURg74dw", "user_id": "fuslIq-ZJCd-qornjEokUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "The beer was really good, the staff was friendly enough and the atmosphere was interesting. I thought it was a little strange they only had one seat at the bar but it was open so I sat in it. It was kind of strange being the only person sitting at the bar but I wanted to sit.

It's well located in the city and has ample seating both indoor and outdoor. The beer here is pretty good, but it's too heavy on IPAs for my taste. The posted menu also obscures that you can do beer tasting flights, which seems odd for a brewery. I also wish they offered tours more times than just on Saturdays. We visited on a Monday of a holiday weekend and it would have been a nice addition to our visit."}, {"review_id": "BkObb0ch3Bvt1EmOgvv27Q", "user_id": "PoFcVUmXmHYh4gms7whxLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Overview: Good ambiance, catered towards a younger crowd. Loud, but it was also pretty packed. Friendly bartenders, a little pricy. Flights (4x 4oz) are $12-$13.Beers tried:Snakehander Double IPA - Definitely hoppy. Great choice if you like strong IPAs, don't pick it if you don't like hoppy beers.Bearded Lady Wheat Ale - Light on taste, but nothing terrible. No aroma. Good for people who don't like strongly flavored beers.Denim Downhiller Winter Ale - A little overly bitter. Seems to have a bit of chocolate and caramel, but neither flavor is pronounced enough.Urban Farmer Farmhouse Ale - Favorite of the bunch, has a balanced flavor, would be a good choice for people who aren't a fan of strong flavored beer like stouts or IPAs, but want to branch out to something different."}, {"review_id": "hywLZAd5D67IjM81ETZkzQ", "user_id": "VpjFgVn_Mtb6p08Ygbobtg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Located right across from regions field where the Birmingham Barons play. It's a perfect place to grab a brew and enjoy a ball game. But when season is out it's still a great place to have one of their many local beers that they offer. Large inside and great patio seating. They have plenty of gear you can get as well from dog collars to t shirts. As are most breweries here and throughout its pet friendly so bring you dog and just sit and people watch. That's what I love to do. As far as beer goes my favorites are the bearded lady and the Mexican lager. Smooth and refreshing. Staff here is friendly and helpful. They often have a local food truck there as  well and rotate them each and every week. Should definitely come and check it out."}, {"review_id": "Xb1ja8R3zkBrkjXu5D-g2g", "user_id": "G1h1gHD9q31P4b-sIBoz6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Strictly beer speaking, yes, the beer is pretty good, actually, surprisingly good and well made. But one beer server for a whole brewery it's a bit on the understaffed side. Plus, beertenders get cranky and crazy when all they hear is \"here! here!\".But once you get your beer, you can sit down on the community tables and enjoy your malty beverages. And yes, the beer is good. The locals are pretty good, people come with their pets and stuff, and there is a food truck outside.

More like GREAT People Brewing... AmIRight??? I've had a few of their beers at shares with a friend from Bham, but recently had the pleasure of going straight to the source on a recent visit. They were a sponsor at Yelp's Prism Party so I knocked a few back there and then went to the after party hosted by Good People. You walk up to a big outdoor patio and see the Good People moniker in lights outside. Inside is hipster-chic full of reclaimed wood and polished concrete. There's a mile long bar with chalkboard \"taps\" and plenty of space to spread out with a group. I didn't take the tour because I was tired and I've heard that spiel approximately 37 times but I did get to chatting with one of their reps. Not only did I love the beers Good People are producing, I love the good people themselves. They have a great mission to use quality ingredients to make exceptional beer bringing good people together in life. They also donate ten percent of proceeds to charity... because once again they're Good People! Since then I've been rockin' my Snakehandler shirt and spreading the word of Good People in hopes that they will one day distribute in Charleston too."}, {"review_id": "LEluhqQGtEpxddka1NhOZw", "user_id": "94IKjzbvzGAqqKOCNvuJjg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Being a fan of craft beer and fun taprooms, this place will be one that I recommend to friends coming into the area.  It's a large, nicely decorated tap room with plenty of seating inside and out. There seemed to be plenty of street parking but with the ball park right across the street I can see how that can get crowded quickly.  The beers are pretty solid. I didn't have any that blew my socks off and the beer I asked to have that was to be considered the beer they are known for was an aggressively bitter IPA.

Good People is one of the few if not the first real success story of investing in Birmingham's downtown scene. They saw the potential of what we all now can see of the area and didn't hesitate to open business up in the heart of town.This brewery is in such a prime location with the new Region's Park sitting right next to it and the good quality of entertainment they provide with bands, yoga, meetings, you name it and you won't go wrong having it at Good People.I love the beer and will always have a special place in my heart for Snake Handler!"}, {"review_id": "a0uu_Iqhd2nhQtlGr0_ssg", "user_id": "eur7ZrMRsSacs-GOfOKS5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/29/2017", "text": "Good People is a staple in Birmingham.

We're good friends with the GM, Greg Stein, who is currently our neighbor in Avondale...one of the best humans I've come to know. He brings meaning to \"Good People\"...it's individuals like that who make or break a brewery.Only downside to GPB (and most breweries) is no greenspace.

But that's not why we go to breweries, right? If a brewery has all of that stuff nailed down, but their beer is subpar, none of it is going to matter. But Good People Brewing has that part covered too.I've only tried 2-3 beers, but I've really liked all of them. The farmhouse ale is virtually a perfect beer. I've never been an IPA fan, so I can't speak to those, but their non-hoppy stuff is great!Before I left, I was lucky enough to score a t-shirt and I will for sure be reppin' Good People down in Tampa Bay!"}, {"review_id": "Aq4_BZS5INR85GGbmHw1Ag", "user_id": "KaAcdFt1xwsfP1bQVfiEtg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Great place, great brewery!

I decided to try it again after not going several years and glad I did. They have re done the layout of the place and it is much more spacious than it used to be. They added more outdoor seating area as well and I was impressed with how nice it was inside. The service was OK- they don't go out of their way to talk to you or recommend anything-especially on a slower day that we went. I'm not a huge fan of Double IPAs but the Snakehandler was super good.  The Coffee Oatmeal Stout probably my second favorite. I will be back, and hopefully this time before or after a game at Regions Field."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/good-people-brewing-birmingham?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
