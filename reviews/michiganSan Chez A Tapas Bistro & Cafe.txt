I'd definitely come back here and I'm coming for breakfast. Must try! If you're from out of town, eat here. You won't be disappointed.Pork belly w/scallops: very good portion of fat n meat. My preference is a bit more seared on the outside but that's me being me. Scallops were tender. I'd give it a 4.75 star.Salmon: delicious. It was ever so slightly overcooked. Flaky and yummy but again, that's me looking for absolute perfection. I'd give it a 4.5 starDuck: meaty and hardly and fat. I definitely appreciate that since I'm Asian and grew up eating this stuff all the time.Egg, bacon tortilla: large enough for 3 or 4 people to share. Beef tenderloin: on point. Medium rare and no complaints or gripes.Shrimp: flavorful. Mash it up with the rice and sauce and throw it down. Croquettes: yes please. Crunchy on the outside and heaven on the inside.Dessert: Get the ice cream cake! F'n amazing! So delicious and the flavors just explode in your mouth and hit all those tastebuds. Ridic! I'd come back just for that dessert to be honest!"}, {"review_id": "DmdbTN53viaZCZNbOUFdGQ", "user_id": "jt49xjEjQisu6wTTGn6B3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I'd had San Chez on my to try list for many years but never got to it during previous visits to Grand Rapids. But a few weekend ago, when my husband and I came to town for a concert, we finally made it here when some friends of ours had already set up shop there for a pre-show meal.It was a busy day in GR as well as in San Chez but it was still fairly easy to get a table here. It was definitely busy but a wait of 10-15 minutes wasn't too bad considering some places on the block had lines out the door! As I mentioned, our friends had already secured a table so we were able to breeze in and have a seat at our spacious booth. As their name implies, it's a tapas joint and we enjoyed a few small plates split amongst ourselves. Anytime I go out for tapas I have to do patatas bravas, so we went for those along with the chicken and chorizo plate with cumin aioli, potato & smoked cheddar croquettes with garlic aioli and honey, ginger carrot hummus, and spanish egg bake with diced potatoes, pimientos, green onions, etc. All the plates were great and the stand outs for me were the chicken and chorizo and the croquettes. Perhaps it was just an issue with our ordering but pretty much everything we ordered had an aioli of some sort. Now, I love aioli but a bit of variety in the sauce bases might have been nice. However, not every dish on the menu has aioli, tho, so I'd definitely try some others in the future to get a bit more variety. Would just need to pay more attention to the dish descriptions to look for it.Our waitress was awesome, super friendly and attentive and ready with the beverage refills before we even realized we needed them. The space itself is bright and airy and I loved our window booth on a sunny Saturday late afternoon.  Also cool--they do have gluten free and allergy friendly menus upon request. It's a great place for folks of all different dietary plans to enjoy--vegetarians, meat eaters, allergy avoiders, et al. We look forward to our next visit, for sure!"}, {"review_id": "IB7WKkyTuHY27VldzygSqQ", "user_id": "HYVESLDUtjgFP6uY6o1Nrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "My girlfriend and I visited for a light dinner and were exceptionally pleased with our overall experience. They take food allergies very seriously and have separate menus for around nine different allergies. The tapas menu that was free from gluten was extensive and delicious! We ordered gluten free bread on the side and it was the most delightful, crusty, warm baguette type roll. The service was intense but very friendly and attentive."}, {"review_id": "5K8lE06tl1IPyz0BtM_9sQ", "user_id": "aBZBPKOau_VoDDOYYYMe2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Went to brunch today at San Chez and loved it. The service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere is great. I got the breakfast wrap and my friend got the casserole scramble. Both were great. The french pressed coffee was a really nice addition to the meal (hazelnut) too. We got there close to 10 and must have got there just before the Sunday rush. Didn't have to wait at all. The portion size was really nice too, I was full halfway through so, for $16 total, I now have a fab lunch waiting in the fridge!"}, {"review_id": "IYUWKcsB0Un3uW9Eu1y8BA", "user_id": "cNpNwIULPq5thzIKnqAQZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "A quintessential favorite for years. 15 years ago I even proposed to my wife here and the staff joined in on the surprise!

The tapas are a perfect portion size for sharing and great to mix and match. My dad and I split las croquetas de patatas con queso (my personal favorite), la tortilla española, coles de bruselas and albóndigas (beef & chorizo meatballs). Un aplauso for this restaurant for taking a Spanish staple and doing it right. On top of that, we were right in the heart of downtown and only had to walk five minutes to Van Andel Arena. Would highly recommend if you're craving authentic tapas."}, {"review_id": "Fyfu2Q4UIWSzkBEWdn3MBA", "user_id": "UDKOhKhb5GgH4NZkxS8vug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Best lunch ever!!

It's a popular restaurant, so I have been coming here for years, usually not by choice, but because whatever friend I'm with wants to eat here. I really only enjoy San Chez for brunch. Every time I've had tapas/dinner here, Ive been underwhelmed, especially considering how pricey it is to get your fill. I get the concept of tapas. I get small plates. I've just had better tapas, for not so extreme prices. It's just the only tapas game in town. Perhaps they'd step up their game if there were more tapas competition in GR...just saying: 2 fried plantains slices and some sauce for $5 is insane. I swear Im not a cheap bastard and don't have a ridiculous appetite or anything. This place is just not for me. I find it very overrated. Brunch is decent though. It's a cute place. Service is always exceptional. 3/5 food wise..."}, {"review_id": "fzjbTXnyubtAiqN_eIu_7A", "user_id": "QMv3G0xwD4u4me0_nWXTng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Brunch here is amazing - especially the mimosa flight with the different types of juices.

I know there have been some management changes. We were part of a large birthday celebration - maybe 10 people - nothing too overwhelming.This time I opted to try some different tapas. Maybe I shouldn't have.1) ALMENDRAS marcona almonds, paprika, garlic olive oil, sea salt - good, nothing special.2) ESPÁRRAGOS CON ROMESCO grilled asparagus, romesco sauce, marcona almonds, lemon - we added scallops. It was good. The asparagus was really young, and thin, not the best.3) SETA RELLENA stuffed portabella cap with spinach, manchego cheese, roasted red peppers, garlic, tomato vinaigrette - we added the crispy serrano ham. I'd say the ham was a little too crispy - crunchy even and hard to eat. 4) CEVICHE citrus cooked shrimp & crab*, raw diced vegetables, lawash chips - this was pretty bad. Unlike any ceviche I have ever encountered. Bland. Boring. There was nothing special about it. 5) POLLO Y CHORIZO A LA PLANCHA grilled chicken & local chorizo, cumin alioli - this was solid. Really enjoyed both the chicken and chorizo. Think it would be better if there was some vegetable added.Again I do love San Chez. Of course I will be back. The service was great. Ambiance fun and nice as always. Maybe I just had bad choices. I don't know. But I do know I won't be ordering the ceviche again."}, {"review_id": "D3Qjj3ORF0QiVJ-kdAnuDg", "user_id": "JMUP-NR2Zlp7Gsz2rzE6pw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "Great find in Grand Rapids during a girls night out in the town. The place itself offers a wide variety of delicious small tapas reminding me of my days in Spain. The waitress from the being was very helpful with overall recommendations and very friendly throughout the night. We all started with the a pitcher of mixed sangria. Food wise - we ordered numerous dishes off the menu such as the patatas bravas, fritos de queso azul, gambas asadas al fuego, vieras y tocino, pulpo, empanadas y croquettes.  I personally would recommend the pulpo, gambas asadas al fuego y fritos de queso azul.  Between three of us, close to ten plates of tapas and the sanagria it came to $45 per person. Overall, wonderful place to spend any occasion and highly recommend it to anyone in town."}, {"review_id": "CMmNa0qHtnlRhkscJO0fWA", "user_id": "if3b1CBDBDJYnGo_hXtHDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "Came here for brunch on a Sunday and when i had first arrived it was pretty empty. That wasn't the case for long because not even 30 minutes later, almost every table was taken. Service was great! Super friendly and helpful with recommendations, attentive and aware of every patron. I truly thought the service-- especially my server Kate, is the reason the visit was so lovely. Now...Here's the run down of what i got: Queso de cabra: goat cheese dip-- i think i had high hopes for this as I've had plenty of amazing goat cheese dips, and so sadly this fell short of my expectations. While it was warm and goes well with the tomato sauce i wasn't sure how outstanding it was verses me throwing it on a platter at home. I think a couple more herbs could have been used in the goat cheese or a zing of some sort in the sauce Empanadas:umm holy cow. This this was scrumcious! Best item that I ordered!! I've had my fair share of empanadas but this one, simple, filled with potatoes, onions, over a cream sauce with a side of tomatoes just mixed all together created an absolute wonderful combination of flavors that completely gelled together well. I would order 2 of these the next time i come. One for me and one for everyone else Croquettes: fancy tater tots, id say. The honey and the aioli on the bottom combined with one another is absolutely delicious. The croquettes themselves were sweeter than i had anticipated.  And while i think they had a great crunch on the outside, something was missing a bit from it coming all together Coles de bruselas: sautéed brussel sprouts, basically what it is. Nice touch with the almonds but nothing too special Overall i would come back for the environment and the empanadas as well as to try other items on the menu. Happy tapas eating!"}, {"review_id": "HEpe2EZN_Ms3bAAVJtgqgg", "user_id": "NH0jtJPJaLvE4ZvK3JPuog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "I highly recommend San Chez Bistro, especially for your special event needs.

I met my daughter here for brunch before exploring art prize. It was busy. We expected up to a 45 minute wait, and explored the art in the lobby for about ten minutes. As soon as we sat down in the lobby, they were ready for us. Our server was friendly, explained the menu and got us started with drinks. The house red wine is excellent. My daughter loved her strawberry soda drink. I had a taste, and it was absolutely delicious, strawberry soda, layered with strawberry sauce and whipped heavy cream! We both had a long-ish drive to meet there and were hungry, so we started with the goat cheese plate. It was good, the pesto and peppers added texture and flavor to the tangy cheese. We also split an empanadas and a rice ball. Both were well flavored and fun to share. Their respective sauces added to the strong flavors and lightened up the heaviness, richness. Each of us has a different sandwich with their papas bravas, seasoned, fried potatoes. The potatoes were the only item that missed the mark. They were seasoned with some Lowry's type seasoning salt and there was no crunch, boring. The sandwiches, however, were delicious. We happily packed up the leftovers to take home. The atmosphere here is fun. Solid crowd, creative space, lots of art and color. I hope we can try it out again."}, {"review_id": "-lHu1i2UBK_Kjlh_HjjDFw", "user_id": "1ntMlC5-2UMxAuCUiYUx-A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "Came for brunch on Saturday AM, the host said there generally isn't too bad of a wait before 10ish.  Our server was great at taking orders but kinda disappeared once he got them.. we noticed that the tables by us were getting their food even though they were seated after us!  Shrimp and grits were ok- grits were a little too runny and there were only 3 shrimp for the whole order.  My mom's corned beef hash was just slices of corned beef with eggs, not shredded the way she had expected.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food!
