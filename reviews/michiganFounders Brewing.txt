Its worth the wait and visit. There are community tables, single tables, and so much more. Its a kid friendly environment. Founders is nation wide for a reason. I wasn't surprised to see their beer in NY.The food is amazing and always up to date, with the trendiest burgers, fries, and a whole lot of deliciousness. Whenever visiting, one can get happy drunk, and spend way too much on friends and sometimes stranger's drinks. It's a bit more pricey than others, but it's about the experience.Again the staff are great, always accommodating, and are always found wearing smiles. They are damn good at their jobs and a diverse group."}, {"review_id": "4UJ35XQ11do65POdISozlg", "user_id": "9TIOZbR9bQK0tpKChlhfAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "This place is the perfect place to meet up on a weekend and just relax!  There's always something going on here, and you'll never run out of new things to try.  The variety of different beers available is fantastic.  My favorite is the Rubaeus, nitro if you can get it.  There are several bars and areas to get food both inside and out.  The large outdoor area has just the right combo of sun and shade and plenty of seating.  Even when we have come on busy days, like during the Black Party, we were able to find somewhere to be comfortable."}, {"review_id": "RvNMXRX9zpzhFVUK9ZvBJQ", "user_id": "KJDofZ0AJZ1SMzPV2f-s9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Checked !I do not think I need to describe how good this microbrewery is doing!

The place is huge and the ambiance is awesome. There is a festival going on today and I had a lot of fun. As far as the beer, I had the All Day IPA, which is their most popular.

Whether or not you like beer (I'm not the biggest fan) this is a great place to hang out and have some great eats! I was in town visiting a friend and we came to Founders for the experience and a chilled out Wednesday night. Since neither of us are big beer drinkers, we each got a set of beer flights. You get 4 5-oz flights, which is perfect if you're looking to try out the different brews!Personally, I like the fruitier beers so I found myself loving the Nitro Rubaeus and the Apricot Wheat. Neither were too sweet nor too bitter. The Huns and Roses also seemed to be a fan favorite as I heard everyone who stopped by the bar order that. I also ordered a pretzel - I'm pretty sure it was the size of my whole head...! They've got a great system for ordering food at the bar - you get a buzzer and once it goes off, you can go pick your food up by the kitchen.We didn't finish all of our flights (mainly due to taste), but we were able to make new friends and share those flights with them! Super great ambience here, spacing might be a bit tight since it always seems to be busy! I'd definitely come here again and stick to my Nitro Rubaeus next time!"}, {"review_id": "RzhD8gZKgsfyqU8NY6WmAQ", "user_id": "OMoBzr4FhDkk7yV8zYtmiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I first heard about Founders in 2015 or '16 when they started distributing to Northern California.  Since I'm originally from Michigan I jumped at the chance to attend a release party at Zeitgeist, in San Francisco.  I've been a fan ever since.Now, a perk to visiting family is visiting the brewery.  There is SO much more variety than is available in CA.  Not only am I able to taste the robust beers straight from the tap but the food is on point too.  Many of the menu items even have the beer incorporated into them."}, {"review_id": "XCXysmZFlh-AfJVqaHUWAA", "user_id": "hWCMjfymhc1p8EIeoKRikg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "This is probably my favorite bar in Grand Rapids.

They've come from nothing, almost lost it (multiple times), and are now some of the most highly revered brewers in the US and globally.

All the beer is delicious. Expect a wait and line out the door on beer release nights/weekends.Food: The only thing better than the beer is probably their food. Hands down the best gourmet deli sandwiches I have ever had. Their beer cheese dip and hummus are also excellent.Atmosphere: Fun! It is always lively and always crowded wether it is a weeknight or weekend. I like the part communal seating options and their outdoor area with the bar and fire pit are a must in the summer. On the weekends they even have live music.The only downside for me is unless you arrive by 5 or before on the weekend (and even some weekdays) you can expect to wait for a table and since it is seat yourself on a busy night seating is hard to come by.

You get a buzzer to tell you when your food is ready but there is also a great patio available outside complete with a fireHoney wheat: sweet, smooth, pale ale, with a slightly nutty after taste. An overall great find Reds rye: the PERFECT mix of an ipa and Red ale. This had the color of the red and the taste of barely and hops. It was also very smooth with just enough of a bitter layer at the end Rubaeus: raspberry ale! The smell alone of it is amazing! Then you take a sip and it is straight dessert sweet goodness! And with 5.7% alcohol this gem is the perfect beginning or end to a night BA Sumatra: holy cow! This thing is 11.8% abv plain goodness. Imperial brown ale.

Both are listed as munchies, don't be fooled, the portion sizes here are very very generous. I definitely left with enough leftovers for a second meal for the following day.
