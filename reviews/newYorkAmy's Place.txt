Their vegan breakfast is phenomenal! I like to go before 9 for their early bird special. It's worth getting up early for their good deals. I usually get the lentils with broccoli, home fries and toast with seitan and also their vegan L.A. cinnamon bread French toast (I eat a lot). The food is great and yummy, and the portions are generous. Lunch and dinner food is yummy as well, but breakfast is where it's at. It can be cold in there sometimes in the winter so you might want to keep your coat on while eating, which is a little annoying but that's okay. Go to Amy's and get some breakfast!!"}, {"review_id": "TH5Ci9_87IfkBZSocnkWEw", "user_id": "TV_bXcNt67TXYVXSU4PZ-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "Service: I came with 2 friends on a Saturday for a late dinner. It was seat yourself. Once seated, our server quickly came over for drink orders and to answer questions.  He was super helpful and accommodating. Food: the food was absolutely delicious. I ordered seitan wings and the seitan was nicely seasoned so it didn't have that gross doughy flavor. The wings were fried and dressed with BBQ sauce and arrived with a side of their vegan bleu cheese which was outrageous. And DRUM ROLL PLEASE, before becoming vegan I would eat Reuben's at least once a week and haven't had one in over a year. You can imagine my delight at seeing this on the menu. Their vegan Reuben comes with sauerkraut and slices of seitan with vegan thousand island on rye. Typically, Reuben's comes with Swiss but I didn't miss it at all on their version. The one area of improvement would be the fries...we all had some version of fries with our meal and they needed to be fried longer to get some color and weren't seasoned when we arrived. Otherwise, Amy's Place was exactly what we needed and I will definitely be going again! Ambience: it was pretty cold inside when we first sat, but after mentioning it to our server he quickly turned the heat on. The interior reminds me of a hots place with shabby interior. I wish I was in Buffalo more often because this is an awesome place for vegans and their non-vegan counterparts to satisfy their hunger.  If you're in the area, go!"}, {"review_id": "yUbVdYMVNsLgtYlqOdxyuQ", "user_id": "vEDulpCjdtVir0aihxQwDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "It is a very cool unique place the food was good and service as well.

Mismatching coffee mugs, 90's classic rock, quirky waitresses. The barstools, and the checker-print floors. It's a diner. But what steals the show are the food options.With a lot of mediterranean faire, breakfast all day, a laundry list of burgers and chicken dishes, and plenty of seitan to go around, this place has food for everyone. I ended up with the mini (read: HUGE. Must be opposite day) hummus wrap, and the bbq seitan wings. Wings were fantastic, wrap was okay.This place feels familiar though I know i've never been here. Maybe it's the nostalgia. Maybe it's the music."}, {"review_id": "2ZYodfS1MpTDIkrx1_-P-g", "user_id": "QlYuSjlWuph4XIfqCgw_7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/31/2017", "text": "Amy's has such a variety of compassionate and healthy options that it makes me rave everytime. If you are an aspiring vegetarian/vegan, try Biff burger. So so good! My rather non- vegetarian boyfriend said that between a real pulled pork sandwich and a Biff burger he would go for Biff anytime. We also had vegan buffalo chicken wings. Again comments from non-v bf: \"they are crispy outside and so juicy inside!\". We also tried vegan tuna on a bagel and tofu scramble. I'd say that vegan tuna salad tastes more like a good potato salad - not bad, but not 'tunish' enough for me. Maybe adding more flax?"}, {"review_id": "RJovjjAiPatwJiD6RDZNwg", "user_id": "sw5PhF2ALEZ1I1aj-HaelA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/14/2017", "text": "Nahhhhh, I don't own the place, but it definitely became my place to go!

Definitely want to come back when I come back to Buffalo. I was in this beautiful city for a concert last night, and we needed a breakfast place to go to, and my friend who has been here before suggested this place and I'm glad she did. They have options for everyone including vegetarians and vegans!They opened at 7:00am and we needed to get their as soon as possible because it gets busy. We got there and their were plenty of seats available and the only ones in the restaurant besides a few patrons were a whole bunch of Buffalo Police. If the Buffalo police like this place, then this place is good. The restaurant inside is very divey looking, which adds to the ambiance of the restaurant. I browsed the menu and I ordered two sunny side up eggs with toast, bacon and it came with home fries. My friend who is a vegan ordered the 2-2-2, and my other friend ordered eggs with home fries. The place wasn't that busy and our meals came out within 10-15 minutes of getting there. The waitress was nice, like your regular diner waitress attitude, I liked it.The meal was great, the eggs were wonderful, the bacon was crispy and the home fries were sliced thin and seasoned, they tasted delicious. The coffee was served in the most random mugs, the ambiance reminded me of a diner you would see on TV. Everyone was so friendly, even the cops that were sitting at a huge table a couple seats behind us; this must be one of their staples."}, {"review_id": "Ig-O-fDiGo6SOBi8XEPfWA", "user_id": "CYyHiOsDzkeA3h20xa1Uzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "This place has all sorts of character.  I was first introduced to this place by my then, future wife and fell in love with it. The Food, the Staff, the Dining area all are great.  I mean this place has food for any dietary need, both Vegans and Carnivores can share the same table here because of the wide variety.  Have a food allergy, no problem, they accommodate without  issue.  My personal favorites are the Ann Kabob, the Breakfast Wrap and the Fajita Fries but this place has so much more.  Lebanese/Mediterranean food galore, all day breakfast, really good burgers, soups and more. This place is loaded with food options.  All brought to you by friendly and sometimes sassy servers.  I am a fan of Funny coffee mugs and this place has them in abundance. Also they regularly change the wall decorations, whether they put up drawings done by the kiddo's of their patrons or putting up work from a local school, their walls provide a nice distraction.  In general I'm a fan of this place and would suggest you give it a try.The only thing that I think detracts at all from this business is the fact that they are Cash Only, but they have an ATM on site so that isn't even an issue really."}, {"review_id": "XARJwiGRfxAGm5fjbCW9Pg", "user_id": "fZP8Vps3KvvDIO38MNZqUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Place is always amazing, having a kafta sandwich with chips and it is just delightful!

It's a sanctuary for vegans and vegetarians with all of the options on the menu for them. We stopped in for brunch on a Saturday and it was really crowded. That's pretty typical. There's no vestibule or putting names on a list, so you just form a line and dodge the servers and hope your butt doesn't plop into someone's plate of food. And if it's cold, you should probably dress warm to stand outside. Now, being a carnivore and having a multitude of diner options available to me, this wasn't overly appealing to me. I ordered the pancakes and home fries. My friends ordered omelettes and French toast. The vegan French toast was a big hit. Everything else was good, but not so amazing that we're counting down the days til we return. It's a tiny, kitschy, old-school diner that's run like a well-oiled machine, but I would probably only recommend it as a vegan haven."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/amys-place-buffalo?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
