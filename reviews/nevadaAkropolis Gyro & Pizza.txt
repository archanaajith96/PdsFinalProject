No bueno.This Greek restaurant is fairly new being here in the neighborhood for a few months. The Gyros here are probably the best in all of Las Vegas. They are made from scratch & made from pork. Apparently in Greece gyros are made exclusively of pork. One thing that really stands out is their customer service. They are so friendly at Akropolis they make you feel like family. I have not yet tried their pizza or other menu options because the gyros are so amazing but will soon. The homemade rice pudding is also made from scratch and is a must have."}, {"review_id": "VB27_EIPqRSS-jC0xzyNFA", "user_id": "Zy2CsKycXRDizxRxzhRFbA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "What a great find on Yelp! After spending the morning hiking around Hoover Dam, I was starving and this pizza hit the spot. The pizzas here are creative and unique, with a fun Greek flair. We asked for a recommendation from the cashier, and he basically raved about ALL of the pizzas! My dining companion and I decided on the ricotta, broccoli, and sausage pizza.  We ordered a 16 inch pizza which was more than enough for 2 people (we had leftovers for DAYS). The pizza itself was awesome -- the dough was perfect and the toppings were fresh and flavorful. The ricotta really elevated this pizza -- now I want ricotta on all of my pizzas! The owner was super friendly and attentive -- he chatted with us for a while and gave us local travel tips. All in all, this was a great lunch spot just outside of Las Vegas. Friendly service and amazing food! I can't wait to go back and try their gyros."}, {"review_id": "Pv844ezPuf_jyZRHOrlb0Q", "user_id": "nBssWrodnyH2iZ6hEI438w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update: So this place changed owners and you can tell the difference, I'm speaking about the chicken gyros.

He could have easily eaten the whole thing. But why gorge?  He adores those calzones.Chatting with the cashier, he told us that they are known for their gyros.  I promised next time!"}, {"review_id": "4n95L4ouEVWsJgd2Pe6OAQ", "user_id": "HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/21/2017", "text": "4 stars, but rounding up for the excellent service! Sometimes that's what sticks out the most to the customer and the folks here at Akropolis make it a point to leave a lasting impression. If it weren't for another nearby Greek spot being closed on Sundays, I probably would not have gotten the chance to stop in here. It was the middle of their lunch special (11a-4p daily), so I decided to try their GYRO COMBO ($8.99). You have the choice of either pork or chicken, so I went with chicken. It includes fries and a drink, but they can substitute the fries for a side salad. For drinks, you can get a cup for the soda fountain, or one of the canned beverages in their refrigerator. I got two combos to-go, so they insisted on helping me carry the food to my car. As I was exiting, the cook in the back thanked me for stopping by. I love small businesses like this because they actually make an effort with these small gestures. When I got home, I saw that they even threw in a couple of complimentary cinnamon rice puddings -- thanks! My chicken gyro was delish, the pita was perfectly fluffy. The tzatziki, cucumber, onion, feta is a huge party swirling in your mouth. I found a few fries in my gyros thinking they got mistakenly thrown in there, but that's how they make 'em for everybody (see other reviews). I'll definitely be stopping in more, and you should too!"}, {"review_id": "bmI-G7aE_n92LVNjIH3D1g", "user_id": "29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2017", "text": "Went here with some friends because we wanted some Mediterranean food and figured we'd try a new place instead of just going to the Great Greek or Greek Bistro. I ordered the pork gyro and to my pleasant surprise the worker told us they had a lunch special going on where you can also get fries and a drink for about the same price. Definitely earned some brownie points with that move!The pork gyro itself was decent. It wasn't bad, but it didn't have anything to make it stand out from the other places I've been to. I also felt like there wasn't as much meat and they went a little too heavy with the tzatziki sauce lol. The fries were pretty good and crispy (you'd be surprised at how many places I've been to where they can't even get that right lol). I ended up paying about $10 for my whole meal which was a pretty good price considering the cuisine and the amount of food.I'd recommend for you guys to check this place out if you want something casual and filling for lunch. It's located in the corner of a small plaza with a gas station so make sure to keep an eye out if you are trying to get to this location. The workers are really nice so feel free to ask them questions!"}, {"review_id": "xckLaFqTX52gGH_fg7CDBg", "user_id": "N4Jke0RmiMf290srw6a6Mw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "This is going to be quick and easy!

Asked for extra sauce and it was horribly dry added mayo just to eat it. Thought it came with fries but there were 3 on the gyro and that's it. 25 bucks? No thank u ever again. I will go to another place that has gyros that melt In Ur mouth and tzaziki sauce is the best ever just didn't want to drive after a long day.

Now here's the only problem we had, the pizza was so soggy on the bottom my son refused to eat it, I tried some and couldn't finish it as well.

Prices are great and If you are looking for excellent food, top notch service and a nice quiet place to enjoy and catch up with family then this is the spot! If not this is still the spot cuz they deliver too!!!My sister was in town visiting which is a rare treat and the kids were feeling like pizza and my sister and I wanted something a bit healthier so we decided to try Akropolis after seeing it's good reviews and we were not disappointed!! Although they offer a full kids menu, we ordered a large cheese pizza for the kids (3 kids under 12yrs) 2 of which are picky with even their cheese pizzas but they devoured it! I have never seen 3 little humans finish a whole large pizza themselves! We also ordered a pepperoni pizza and my brother was excited to be given the choice of regular pepperoni or Cup&Char pepperoni! For those who don't know Cup&Char, they are those little pepperonis that curl up into little cups and are perfectly crispy and yummy, I highly recommend this pepperoni for your pizza!  The pizza was excellent, crust was perfect and a choice of pepperoni, come on need I say more?!!!On the healthier side they offer salad and gyros. I like this simplicity that they only offer either pork or chicken for the meat options on these. Both my sister and I ordered the chicken gyros and I had to modify mine with no onion or tomatoes cuz I'm that person but they did not blink and eye and obliged my special request! The gyros were AMAZING!!! They were not stingy with the feta and tzatziki sauce which I love cuz I am a condiment queen! P.S. it also had a couple of fries stuffed in there! The fries were golden crispy and perfect! I cannot wait to return to this place, the hospitality of the staff/owners made me feel so welcomed and as if I was a part of their family! I will definitely have to try the pork next time and indulge in some of their other offerings which include Baklava, Spanakopita, Akropolis Fries(Feta cheese, fresh parsley and lemon) and also basic philly cheese steaks and hoagies!"}, {"review_id": "KImgPbPwz10HmAXYJj4wTw", "user_id": "i9U2ImjadZX9K_Az5ncOyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "Wonderful homemade scratch cooked food, large portions and friendly service.

Management, thank you so much for treating us like friends, we had such a great time! (They had a chess board on one of the tables... we're nerds lol)Now, the food. We both got the chicken gyro combos for lunch which came with fries and a can of soda. The fries were SO GOOD. The gyro was filling and satisfying, the tzatziki sauce was not too thick and so tasty.
