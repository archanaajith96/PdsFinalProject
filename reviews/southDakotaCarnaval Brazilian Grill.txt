The salad bar wasn't that great, but let's be real who really goes to a Brazilian Grill for the salad bar? The choices of meats to try was absolutely crazy. You couldn't go wrong... unless you were a vegetarian I guess. The only thing I didn't care for was the cinnamon pineapple, but to each their own I guess. Thank you so much for the amazing experience. We left as they were setting up the jazz band. But I'm sure they were pretty good too. The restaurant was very big and dimly lit."}, {"review_id": "uQ1H_igHZXczMVualRm4ig", "user_id": "oWA5lXBJGh_scShXh-JYHA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Save yourself money and go somewhere where you can get real meat. For $30 you get bunch of low quality cuts, sausages, and some pineapple. Beef they served tonight made me to throw up. So hard, so smelly. Chicken was terrible too. Next, I like medium well, but they were serving only rare. I felt like I am begging them to bring me some food.Servers were slow and plate empty all the time. Paid $40 and left hungry and mad. Ambient is so dark and awful. This was cool place and had good food, so not sure what happened. No way I would go here again. There are many steakhouses and bbq places and even chinese hibachi place is much better and 3 times cheaper."}, {"review_id": "jxhfUY4uV2sWlVOtyAALuQ", "user_id": "8kvZ9KcDN1eDQsbMcm28Hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "This is one of the best places we have eaten at in Sioux Falls.

That's it we're done here.The bad ...A salad bar for $15? Now I know why America is fat ...can't afford lettuce and cheese and dressing at a restaurant.The meats ...The lamb was more dry than my underwear since eating there.The red meat required more chewing than a case of Wrigly and had less taste than a hobo.Finally, 24 hours later and I have done a serious disservice to my toilet. I flush it and all that comes out are tears. I did the first damage to my toilet 2 hours after eating here.The positive is that they are helping the economy by boosting toilet paper sales.If you want to lose 30 pounds by eating a quarter pound of food you should eat here.If you work for Charmin toilet paper you should partner with this restaurant."}, {"review_id": "VSgnP0zUdZZhp9Vuo80erg", "user_id": "fQQM3BAkRSLFMxglCCxO_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/19/2017", "text": "If you have been to Fogo de Chao, and you like it, you will love Carnaval.  My wife says that it is a romantic place to eat.  That is fine by me.  I think it is a place to gorge on great steaks.  We both leave happy.Carnaval is like Fogo, but without being corporate.  Carnaval is owned by local folks right in Sioux Falls.  Carnaval is located right next to Morrie's Steakhouse.  Morrie's is good, and I would recommend it, but I would never recommend Morrie's over Carnaval.  As with every Brazilian Steakhouse, you will be presented with many choices of meat to choose from, over and over again, at your table.  My personal favorites are the lamb, and the signature beef.Let's talk about my favorite one liner to use at Carnaval: \"If you don't see the sucker at the table, you are the sucker!\"  Don't fill yourself up with the BBQ Pork, the chicken, or the flank steak.... be patient and get the good stuff.  If you ask your server, they will send over a goucho with whatever you like.For a few bucks more, you can add shrimp.  IMO this is a waste of money.  You are here for the steak, eat steak."}, {"review_id": "WuywYsJnZiO_x-hQIs24yw", "user_id": "_1ANwsddlu2hs0FQN9cTEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "Best steakhouse in Sioux Falls period.

(i.e. No).....but I kept my eye open for the next one I wanted to try.  Their delivery of the meats was perfect! Its one price once you decide what variety you want to enjoy. They do offer some ala carte meals as well....but what's the point with such delectable Brazilian grill meats tempting you every moment of your vist to this delightful restaurant.For someone from Wisconsin  I found the prices very reasonable for such an amazing meal.   Dress code ranged from casual to business casual....You can make reservations on Open Table.  Since we were there on a thursday  night around 6:30 we were able to just walk in.   We were amazed by the end of our meal how popular this place is even on a Monday night.  Parking is by the restaurant."}, {"review_id": "LmiOvR6YBhrECkjKUZupmw", "user_id": "zj5jeWEnBvGle-Iy9r1xNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2017", "text": "This was my first time here and the food was amazing. The waitress was super nice and always there when we needed more drinks. It's also nice that you can make reservations just to avoid the wait time! All of the gauchos (meat servers) were super nice and were always willing to talk to us while bringing meats out! The top sirloin was definitely my favorite and my boyfriend loved the lamb. The pinneaple is to die for. Definitely come with an appetite and unless you want salad I would avoid going up to the salad bar as the gauchos come out immediately which was awesome! I like the \"button\" system which is one side is green the other red. Green meaning yes I want more food and the red means I'll pass for now or I'm done but if you aren't done you can always flip back over to green! Overall a great experience and will definitely be coming back!"}, {"review_id": "-65COtyFnnrV91tQbc1H9A", "user_id": "KFkd-7_4newIBXBOu0S9Mw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2017", "text": "This place is amazing!

It's definitely a well-known in Sioux Falls. Try to get a reservation ASAP if you're planning to go on the weekends. First off, exciting yet still intimate atmosphere. Our waitress, Priscilla, was extremely helpful and attended to our needs. She explained things thoroughly as it was our first times there. The Gauchos were nice and helpful as well. The meat kept coming, along with the cinnamon-glazed pineapple, which was my favorite! Off of the meat, hot & cold bar, and bread, we were stuffed after 15 mins! It was nice to try the different meats, but if you're someone who doesn't eat as much, opt for the smallest meal.

The ambiance and service is great. Good salad bar but their feijoada wasn't okay. You can't go wrong making black bean stew (feijoada), right?
