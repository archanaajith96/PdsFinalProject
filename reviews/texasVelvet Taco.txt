My wife and I try our best to hit VT before the crowds rush in from the bars when we're down near down town. They're food is consistently delicious and they're no stranger to a line out the door.  I've never met an unhappy cashier here either.  As for food reco:  The Tikka masala taco and the Crispy Tots and Egg are must haves.

I see proof of concept and the flavor profiles are on point, however the food did not deliver a $5-6 taco experience.  I would put the food I received along the lines of a $2-2.50 price point.  I ordered a Slow Roasted Angus Brisket and a Shrimp and Grits taco.  I know the shrimp was fresh, because I bit down and got a small piece of shell.  It was seasoned well and I liked the concept, however the corn tortilla deconstructed into a masa mess with the grits and the whole thing required a spoon to eat, spoon not incl.  The Angus Brisket was barbacoa-style tender, just as described, and the flour tortilla was sturdy enough to hold the contents of it's bosom in true south of the border street style, however there was an frighteningly vast amount of grease pouring from this taco.  Holy smokes, my dear arteries begged me not to consume this possible week's worth of fat that was free-flowing from this taco, but the sinister #fatkid in me won.I really wished for more positives to even warrant removing the Favor delivery and attempting Velvet again, but it was just an absolutely middling food experience."}, {"review_id": "NlX3ytXSc41q-v7FHXv3cA", "user_id": "VdP8MQQY4lv1ycdUavklXw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "This place is consistently busy, but for a good reason. They serve a twist on your traditional tacos. Here's a breakdown of what we had:Rotisserie chicken -  1/5 Plain, nothing fancy about this one. Just some rotisserie chicken on a corn tortilla. Picnic chicken -  5/5 Fried chicken skin in a taco?! Yes please! This one was probably one of the top two tacos we had. The chicken was crunchy and yummy!Fried paneer -  5/5 My top favorite of the bunch we had! The paneer was creamy and the tikka masala sauce was perfect! It had enough spice not to be too hot. The basil leaf tops it off!Cuban pig -  2/5 I liked the crispy flour tortilla here. This thing is loaded with pig on pig. Bacon, ham and slow roasted pork! Annatto shredded pork -  3/5 The pineapple salsa on here made the taco cold. The sweetness of the pineapple and the hibiscus tortilla also made this taste almost dessert. Fish n' chips -  1/5 Eek. The curry mayo tasted more like Dijon mustard. The least favorite of the bunch we had. I'd pass on this one. Red curry coconut queso -  Definitely a twist on queso! The curry is a bit spicy, so be forewarned. Overall, cheese and curry, you can't go wrong! Overall, the tacos were good and definitely unique. The prices are a bit steep, but you get a pretty decent size taco. We both had 3 each, but 2 would have been plenty! Word of advice, order on the app and save some time!!"}, {"review_id": "zundISEHnrLe9qCVic8JNg", "user_id": "Px6gFOIRmIWrAJKwRIYmyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "My favorite taco place in the states. I'm originally from the New Jersey/New York area and this place to me is by far the best I've been. The chicken tikki which is a little spicy and the flank steak taco are my go to and boy are they good. The place is small but they also have outside seating which is perfect on a hot spring or summer day. Also the tater tots with egg and corn with blue cheese are delicious and actually cheaper than the tacos I just mentioned and even might be a better option. The only set back here is that he prices are high for tacos but I guess it's taste and popularity of the place makes up for it. You won't regret it and it's definitely a 5 star taco place"}, {"review_id": "U4nNGQutyWgos0tqMk7IUg", "user_id": "GSgV1yemmgujF5Ty2rZaGA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/27/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "4/25  I have to start off by saying that I will forever be a loyal fan of Velvet Taco, now with that said I've been pretty disappointed with my last few visits there. It's been a while since I've enjoyed a hot or at least warm taco. No matter the time of day, I always tend to get cold tacos, each and every time. There have been a few times that I've mentioned it to receive new ones but I've stopped doing that due to the persons demeanor towards me. It's pretty disappointing to be honest especially since I rave about VT to everyone. There's just no reason to get cold tacos when they aren't prepared until you order them.

It makes it super easy to figure out what you want. But, beware, you'll still want to order everything. I finally decided on the tots and the bacon & egg frittata. My food came out within a few minutes and I started drooling instantly. Everything was eclectic and delicious. The fried egg on the tots made it super tasty. And the egg in the frittata taco was shaped like the corn tortilla and made the taco a tad sturdier.

They have meat, seafood and vegetarian options which is awesome. They also have a special taco of the day. I went with the #12 Slow roasted angus brisket as well as a side of Mexican corn. I LOVED my taco. Great flavor mix, and they are generous with the fillings but not overkill to where you make a mess with your first bite. The corn on the side was good, but a little too \"saucy.\" This combo was the perfect size for lunch.My sister order the #1 Buffalo chicken and #2 Rotisserie chicken. She very much enjoyed both. The buffalo chicken had great flavor and was bright orange, so you know they don't skimp on the sauce there. She said she added some of the house  hot sauce to the rotisserie chicken and that was the perfect topping.They serve cans of soda and beer, along with some non-traditional fountain drinks. All together its a little pricey for tacos but worth it in my opinion. Perfect portions and great quality.

Parking is a nightmare.  Tow away warning sings all over the back side of the establishment while dedicated parking out front is shared with a Dickey's BBQ.  Next-communal seating.  I dunno if I just wasn't in the mood or the fact I was annoyed by the incessant ramblings of the basic as hell white bitch next to me, but whatever it was I was over it, officially.  It's suuuuuuper loud inside when eating.  Between the cacophonous sounds of everyone attempting to talk over one another and the PA system announcing who's food is ready, it was sensory overload.  I didn't really have much interaction with staff but those few I did encounter were pleasant enough and I was quite shocked to learn their hours going so late on the regular, so kudos them.  There you have it-my take on Velvet Taco.  I didn't find it to be anything that left me speechless, but based on the number of Yelper reviews and its current star rating; others disagree with me. Perhaps it comes from living in San Antonio for ten years or possibly the fact that I've been down with brown ever since coming out in 2002.  Whichever the reason I don't foresee myself craving Velvet Taco anytime soon."}, {"review_id": "2eI-LxY4rwx1WVXfG-7o-w", "user_id": "d7sGKlgd-EcrtoaQ6GPG5g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "I hate to say it but I'm just not understanding the hype over this place.

They also have local fountain drinks but I found them all too sweet. I ordered several different tacos. #2, 8, 10, 11, and 12. My favorite one was 10 the bacon burger. The brisket and chicken tacos were average. I expected a lot more from those two. The best part was actually the sides. The tots were delicious. The egg on top adds a lot of flavor. The corn was also yummy. I didn't want to share. The chips and queso were also very good. For desert they have a two layer red velvet cake that they drizzle caramel on. Yes it's as good as it sounds. From the icing to the actual cake it was very moist and delicious. For the sides and desert I was impressed. Maybe I just ordered the wrong combo of tacos.

The flavors were indescribable, and I'm not even sure how they worked together, but they did. Five stars for that taco alone. I also ordered the house beer, which accompanied everything well, and the queso, which I couldn't get enough of.
