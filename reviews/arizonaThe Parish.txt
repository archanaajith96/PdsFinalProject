The food was very tasty--the drunken pasta was really delicious w/the crawfish in particular. I haven't had that quality of cajun food outside of NOLA that I can remember, which is definitely a testament to this restaurant. The thing that is such a bummer is the waiter who we had that night. One of my pet peeves is treating oneself to a meal that may be on the true enough \"treat yoself\" scale and it ending up in flames because of poor customer service. My friend and I both had dietary restrictions that needed to be accommodated and the server made an insensitive remark regarding that. I don't think he had any malicious intent, but it really put a damper on the experience. Especially when a restaurant is a bit pricier and you're supposed to be paying for the overall experience--service and food included. I followed up with the manager to let them know that for such a price point, servers really need to be more in the loop w/this stuff. This definitely isn't the first place I've been to when the price and service don't match up. Again, the food itself was really on point but unfortunately missed the mark service-wise. With lots of other eateries that may have better service, it's something to consider."}, {"review_id": "QA8WgAkLqwe708vlTL9OHw", "user_id": "ElEUh1-Ux6npfDs56sGPSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "We visited The County of Southern fusion last night, aka The Parish. We surveyed, we dined and we were converted. I am a believer in good customer service as an essential part of a dining experience. If it's not, I might as well eat at home. The reason I'm not giving The Parish five stars is because of the unfriendly and cold reception staff. There were three people manning the reception desk last night and they didn't seem very friendly at all. There were two women and one man. The women at least made a feeble attempt to be nice but the guy had a LOOOOOOOONG and sour face the whole time. He didn't greet us or even crack a smile even though his face was the first thing we encountered upon entering the establishment. We also had to pass by  them as we were leaving and, once again, it was a demonstration of aloofness when they bade us farewell with cold silence.Now, moving onto the positive aspects of our dining experience... the food was otherworldly in its greatness. Every dish we ordered was superb. We started off with the Hot Legs Le Jean aka frog legs wrapped in bacon. Loved the texture and taste! The partner-in-dine went with the Alabama Quail and I the Drunken Angel. The partner-in-dine was chirping high praises for the quail which was pan seared then oven roasted, infused with shrimp, andouille and mushroom cornbread stuffing, and topped with Carolina gold sauce. I became tipsy with ecstasy while devouring my pasta. The Drunken Angel had burgundy angel hair, shrimp, crawfish, lobster broth, in moderately spicy cream sauce. I loved the noodles al dente and the savory cream sauce.The partner-in-dine enjoyed his choice libation so much that he went for round two. He claimed that the Dutch Well Water was tangy and zingy at the same time. I was happy with my Tucson Tap Water.We saved room for dessert and selected the Peach Cobbler in cast iron pan. It was hot, heavenly and heartwarming! We also have to commend our server Jeff who was attentive, friendly and courteous (unlike the cold beings at the reception)."}, {"review_id": "OoTZEvyBttknsBtoViX_pw", "user_id": "afPZfpeIVRM9rNuDvbskgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "3 of us stopped for lunch today. It's worth a visit!I had the Parish burger with a cup of gumbo. The gumbo had a smoky flavor to it and it was great. The burger was cooked as asked, served with crispy bacon sautéed red onions dijon mustard on a really good bun. Excellent, excellent burger, I'd put it easily in the top 10 burgers in Tucson and maybe the top 5. It's a Destination spot for burgers! DDD needs to investigate this place!!!My wife and daughter tried the Pulled pork with a side salad. Pulled pork was served on the same great bun had a sweet bbq sauce and an aioli sauce with a bit of heat. Nice! My wife said it was the best she has ever had!  Again, they slapped this one outta the park! Where the hell is Guy Fieri and DDD? He need to check this place out!The salad was a nice mix on greens and had a lemon blue cheese dressing. Creative and delish!I'll be back! Can't wait to do dinner here!

LA native review. I ordered the Drunken angel and the crawfish was really well seasoned.  This was one of my favorite things I have tried all weekend. It was a creamy pasta with well-cooked, chewy noodles.  Each bite, the pasta picked up insane amounts of creamy, cajun sauce with a nice texture from the crawfish. For appetizers, I had the hush puppies which were definitely a must order.  Crispy on the outside but again, salty inside but lots of cajun influence.  Definitely try when in Tuscon!"}, {"review_id": "6bgwUdoJF_ue_-IiS9LO_g", "user_id": "u7hpiBqATVIM_TUrQFfAkw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "This is one parish I'd gladly attend anytime, not just Sundays or holidays.I was intrigued to try after seeing many of the amazing photos here on Yelp, and I was NOT disappointed.We started with the Southern Edamame, which isn't as \"Southern\" or flavored as one would assume. Let's be honest though, is edamame ever bad? (NOPE!) I ordered a seasonal cocktail, which was a hot cider type drink and my boyfriend ordered a stout. For dinner, I ordered the Shrimp & Grits. It's accompanied with Bliven's greens (I still don't know exactly what those are) and they were so tasty! They arrived on a hot skillet and were coated in the most delicious dressing/sauce! The creole sauce was a perfect compliment to the shrimp and grits, and the grits were by far my favorite. I can't wait to go back and order this dish. The BF ordered the Parish burger, which I did not try, but he was really happy with it! I did sample his fries... (yes I am that girl) and they were awesome!Do not perish from your hunger, just dine at The Parish!

I will say that we did call a couple of other restaurants in the area but they weren't able to get a group of us in on Saturday night. Ending up at The Parish though was definitely a good thing! It's a cute little restaurant, I'd say more of a date night dinner place than a family restaurant as it had a more relaxed, intimate atmosphere.We started off with drinks & then ordered dinner. The choices at the table included Guedry's Gumbo, Drunken Angel, The Tchoup, & The Tomahawk Special. I personally went a simple salad, The Garden District with Smoked Salmon. My husband liked his choice of The Tchoup which was a bone-in pork chop with BBQ sauce, apple kraut, and a sweet potato puree. His mom really enjoyed the Tomahawk Special, it looked too pretty to eat! The others liked their orders as well, minus the Gumbo as it wasn't found to be a hearty dish, lacking chicken and sausage. They did accommodate by bringing out some sausage on the side but the 3 who got it were still a bit disappointed. I enjoyed my salad and found the Smoked Salmon to be tasty; I was told they smoke the salmon in-house.Overall, we thought this was a good choice and a restaurant we would come back to. The Shrimp & Grits have been calling my name ever since! Can't wait to try that dish ... and maybe some Bread Pudding too next time."}, {"review_id": "9SPCgm3APkO0K8x4uVAWmA", "user_id": "-tpHuiN2HbICgJAVPEtbvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We enjoyed our meal here very much and will return.

Very tasty. Then we had the New York strip and fries oh sooo good. The garlic encrusted prime rib also pretty amazing. For desert the mixed berry tart with marshmallow fluff and balsamic reduction. A perfect ending. Not overly sweet just pretty perfect. Their twist on a mimosa well worth trying.

I had the front porch tea, which was sweet and not alcoholic tasting (so dangerous!)For dinner I had shrimp and grits. Ok, but not what I was expecting. My husband got the pork chop - which was HUGE!

The collard greens on the side were good too (just take note they are made with bacon so if you are vegetarian, be careful!). For dessert we shared the bread pudding which was a nice finish to the meal. I cannot remember exactly what I ordered for breakfast but I do remember enjoying it.
