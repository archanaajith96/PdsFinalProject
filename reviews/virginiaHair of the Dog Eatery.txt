Recently visited for the food but was happy with the added services. The food is typically great. I always go for the meat loaf. Amazing.  The waiters are always friendly and never try to rush you to get to the next table. It's true service. They have added perks where you can bring in your chord to even charge your phone and don't forget to ask about the WiFi. Great experience every time we visit."}, {"review_id": "8vvhS3v7Q_gkoh6wD30mUA", "user_id": "pmX_OHLkQ8n3DPC8ZmKErA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "We decided to come here on a Saturday to eat..too late for lunch but too early for dinner.  The restaurant has a nice relaxed vibe. The table booths have coat/jacket hangers and as I mentioned in my tip, they also have chargers if you need to charge your phone which is pretty cool.Dave ordered their Meatloaf Sammy which included bacon wrapped meatloaf, mashed potatoes, spicy roasted tomato chutney on Texas toast. I ordered the Hair of the Dog burger and it consisted of 1/2 in grass fed beef, fried egg, bacon, American cheese & Swiss cheese lettuce, tomato and onion on their signature waffle bun.  Both entrees left us feeling like we were in a food.coma which was not necessarily a bad thing lol. Always nice to take a nap after a meal this huge. I was not able to finish my sandwhich but Dave helped me which was surprising because he finished his whole sandwhich and fries! Mine was really good with or without the syrup. I had a side of their mac n cheese-that was sooo delish.Nice little spot. I enjoyed our visit."}, {"review_id": "AEx-cH5M1eS_mLmWbV9Xfw", "user_id": "zcdakvOQjgVce630-Unx_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I'm in town on a business trip and a few of us wanted to go out and have a meal together tonight. One of my coworker's picked this place based on the positive reviews. I had no idea what they served. We arrived and sat down without a wait. I was shocked to see all the breakfast items on the menu and eventually settled on the HOTD Burger. I try to steer away from carbs and a burger with no bun is usually an easy choice. I ordered my burger with no bun and an extra egg. This was an amazing burger. I got broccoli as my side. I'm very happy with  meal and will be back."}, {"review_id": "guzxab5vlZB_Mqe7irR2Cg", "user_id": "hLVMSWU-Rl_xNjvLX_lL8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "So I really liked this place.  My burger was awesome.   The service was great.  Everyone in my group enjoyed there food.

So we sat at the bar and got some drinks while we waited.It ended up only being a 25 minute wait or so, and then we were promptly seated. Although it was busy, our waiter was very good about getting our water and refilling our coffees. I ordered the hair of the dog burger with a side of Gouda Mac and cheese and my friend ordered the steak and potatoes and eggs with cheese. My meal was great! Presentation was a beauty, but I wasn't a huge fan of how the bottom waffle was not as warm and kind of soggy.  My friends steak and fries was meh both in taste and presentation. It wouldn't typically matter that much except his meal was supposed to be the \"special\" for the day and it was just nothing to write home about. I liked the environment. You could tell it's definitely a very popular joint for sure. I'll definitely be returning! Maybe try something different next time."}, {"review_id": "-0CNQAzHBiMPHcfxH_RRAQ", "user_id": "X7hhyJl59NkLE-UEQNVtRw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "I've been here a few times and it has never disappointed me. The last visit was a bit of a surprise for me because my food came out cold. It took a while to get my coffee as well. I do not know if it was a result of it being extremely busy in there or what. I told my waiter that my food was indeed cold and he took it and replaced it for me. It was a drag because I was so hungry and now I had to wait again for my food. The wait time was about 45 minutes to sit so you can imagine I was ready to eat. I had the chicken Pungo Benedict. The waffle was really good, almost like a hazel or cinnamon taste to it. Their brunch is wayyyy better than their breakfast. Drinks are reasonably priced 6-7 dollars for mimosa's. This experience wasn't so bad I wouldn't go back. They addressed my issue with courtesy."}, {"review_id": "2p_xWoSU9noDVQc0tGMQGg", "user_id": "mBkxVHscXkdx278D_gCZDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "I don't really have a whole lot to say about this place except that the food is amazing. Buffalo chicken quesadilla for an appetizer and that was really good. Could have been a bit warmer but we all enjoyed it. They have, hands down the Best chicken and waffles I've ever had!! I would have liked maybe a little more gravy but I'll just remember to ask for more next time I go. I also had a side of the Mac and cheese and that was a hit at my table! Every one loved it!! One thing that I love that's really silly is that they serve crushed ice in their drinks!! (It's the small things that get you that extra star!! Lol) anyway if you are looking for something a little different give this place a try. Their menu is perfect for breakfast lovers who want to spice it up a bit. Also they have outlets at the tables so you can charge your phone!!"}, {"review_id": "gntizS2txXgZa0wdmfbhQQ", "user_id": "bdJd8-ZqHbmnx1imrPveDQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "The staff is friendly, didn't really care for the food or the drinks was a little meh for my taste, nice setting it's a nice atmosphere overall, relaxed and not uptight.

It's pretty much the same as the Virginia Beach location if you've ever been there. I ordered The Classic eggs Benedict and added spinach (for $0.50 extra) and cubed hash browns on the side. I enjoyed everything but the Hollandaise sauce. It was clumpy and lacked that slightly lemony flavor you'd expect from a good sauce. Im not sure where you can park if you aren't an ODU student, but their back lot is still very limited. Definitely a good place to go if you have an hour or two in between classes, but if you aren't a student, the Virginia Beach location might be better for you if you want to avoid finding a place to park."}, {"review_id": "Y2UEr-W1MbBGDNFeDDuHGA", "user_id": "kOGSxn5ACUByqWURE58P0Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "I am a little torn.  When I first walked in there was a bad smell.

It is a must -go when I am visiting VA Beach. It is always packed. We had a party of 5 and less than 15 minute wait.

The combo of the seafood with the eggs and seafood is like heaven in your mouth!They cook the seafood meat throughout the egg rather than stuffing it inside, while the inside is filled with a little gouda cheese. We had a slight issue and had to send mine back, but the second time it came back perfect.I will continue to eat here anytime I am in town..Maybe next time I try their infamous chicken and waffles"}, {"review_id": "GHejexYoukCdNCfIfo5Kpw", "user_id": "tlUi5u75-Deff6I7hmtAnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "A great taste of the local community.   This venue is a little small, but be weary it is always packed like a Wiggles concert at a kids parade.

Hubby had the Hair of the Dog burger with waffles as the buns and I had the chicken and waffles. The burger was so yummy. Hubby ate all of it within 5 mins because it was that good. Also had a side of Mac and cheese with GOUDA! Delicious he says. My chicken and waffles were delightful, the chicken was so crispy and juicy. Blended so well with the waffle and hot syrup. Make sure to ask for hot syrup with your waffles, it's the perfect combo. Also I had the gravy on the side so that it's not soaked in my food. Enjoyable that way. I give this place 10s. Plus the customer service is on point. Also for a party of 6 or more, there's an 18% gratuity added to your bill.

This past visit was a cheat day for me so I grabbed veggie burger and fries.  Unfortunately fries came out cold but I just asked them for a fresh order they did so immediately and apologized.  It was busy in there so I understand and they got me squared away immediately. I had fresh fries not even half way through the burger.  And once they did OMG amazing fries were hot and crisp. Staff is always friendly. Sometimes the wait can be long but last time we just requested to sit on the patio and this past time sat at the bar so no wait time.  I'm okay with that I usually come hungry and hate to wait.  If you never been can be hard to find as it's hidden in a corner but this is worth the trip.  I know there's another location in Norfolk I've never been to so can't vouch if the food and service is the same."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hair-of-the-dog-eatery-virginia-beach-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
