The food is always fresh and the service is amazing. Don't be shy to ask to sample the sauces if you've never been before! I always go for the Vindaloo and Tikkaway sauces on top of a rice bowl with chicken and chickpeas. The mango lassi is delicious - although a bit on the sweet side, and the papads are light and crispy. And at ~$8 a meal you can't beat the price for the quality and quantity of food you get."}, {"review_id": "eths7bc7LRddmIzLJ9GNig", "user_id": "-2Lwv1vNGesJz9MW9f3gqg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I ordered 3 rice bowls for carry out. On two rice bowls, I asked server to put raita and green chutney on a side cup instead of spreading them over the bowl - as I was not planning to eat them soon and I didn't want my rice bowls to get soggy because of those pop-up sauces. The server's reaction was like it was a big deal, as if I asked for something that She has never been asked before. She then said that I will be charged extra if I take those top-up items on a side cup instead of having them spread over the bowl. When I asked her the reason, she replied that they have to maintain the count of those dipping sauce cups and those tiny plastic cups have a cost. Honestly, the way she responded sounded like I was wasting her time by asking that question. Not only that, in fact her body language was like I made her job difficult by ordering 3 rice bowls at once. I'm giving negative review because my overall ordering experience during my last visit at this place was bad, and I felt very unwelcoming. On a positive note, the food was tasty though."}, {"review_id": "hCfbrYiebOqyEK-tHYbGWw", "user_id": "ZKr4YuXdzq41sVk-_29k-w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "My boyfriend has been raving about this place for weeks because it is walking distance from the apartment and has become his go to for late night food when he can't be bothered to cook.For that situation, when you need quick, affordable food especially if it's a bit late, this place is a great bet! It's not the BEST Indian cuisine ever, but it's really good for being a fast, Chipotle-style counter service situation that is open into the 10/11 pm range of the evening and feeds a hungry couple for around $12. I tried their chai and skipped on that, it didn't taste quite right to me and I'm a chai fanatic. I also found their samosa surprisingly spicy, so go into that with the right mindset. I do think that requesting more of the toppings and sauce too would make the final blend a bit more flavorful, but I was satisfied with my meal here! For your first time visiting, the way it works is you choose a base for what you want your meal build out of, you pick a meat/protein, you pick hot toppings, cold toppings, and sauces. It's exactly like Subway or Chipotle, just with Indian food instead."}, {"review_id": "VzJdqlI5XH1O8M9MGnPmxQ", "user_id": "39ob3TUuT8AVi4Y_POIJnQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Chipotle-style Indian. The flavors are there, although the possible combinations are a bit basic. I tried a salad bowl with lamb, chickpeas, and madras sauce. The sauce was strong and flavorful, but the lamb and chickpeas didn't hold it particularly well. I added onions and cucumbers, and they seemed to mellow the otherwise strong sauce flavor. Overall, I found myself wanting more topping options. I liked that there were mushrooms available as a topping, for example, but they didn't seem to have a ton of flavor. Definitely a good desk lunch option, but not necessarily something to make a trip out of the way for."}, {"review_id": "1sxu7_Nx6HNtu_molGzFyw", "user_id": "JMs1SW5BvhEUkmbeqtVWrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "I first came to Tikkaway Grill two years ago on a weekend trip to New Haven. I loved Tikkaway so much, we came back twice that weekend and I took a samosa chaat for the ride home. I had to bring all my friends to Tikkaway while in Connecticut again. You can pick from a rice bowl, salad bowl or wrap and pick a protein, 1-2 sauces and unlimited toppings. The ingredients are always fresh, the sauces are super flavorful (you can even sample them) and the chutneys are packed with flavor. My favorite sauces are the Masala (medium) and Madras (mild), but they're all amazing.Their samosa chaat is AMAZING, loaded w veggies, toppings, chutneys; lots of flavor and textures.They also have an iced masala chai and iced coffee which delicious!My friends loved the food! The staff was very welcoming and explained how to order, and the manager was kind enough to give my friends and I some complimentary Diwali sweets since Diwali just passed. Great guy and a really nice gesture. Will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "7izbLu-4rpI_H_rbXbZh0Q", "user_id": "1xrSKBsEsCPb94w4ZvjpbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Tikkaway is a fast casual, Chipotle-style Indian place.

Depending on what you get here this can certainly be a frequent stop for those that are food conscious or on a diet. They offer nutfree, gluten free and vegan friendly options which is convenient when looking for a quick bite to eat while with a group. When you arrive expect there to be only enough seating as you'd expect in a small cafe. Their tables are not crammed together (which is great) however this is a smaller.  If you haven't had Indian food before this is also a great stepping stone, they even offer to have you sample their sauces which will definitely ensure that you don't purchase something that you simply can not bring your self to eat! They offer wraps, rice bowls (brown or white rice) or salad as a base and offer 2 sides on the menu if you'd like to purchase something extra. Their portion size is above standards for what you are paying and the quality of the ingredients. Unless I skipped breakfast and had a very active day, I can hardly leave without having a little left over (keep in mind I usually ask for everything except the beats in my rice or salad bowls, if you order less expect less). Their sides and garnishes are really fresh and If you have a chance get their iced coffee, it's delicious!  The staff is great and friendly, while ensuring they serve you as quickly as possible. The manager is extremely personable and enjoys a genuine conversation when possible, I appreciate this and attribute their popularity to his work and attitude. His care and persistence shows not only through their active and knowledgeable staff that is always willing to help you order something more specific to your tastes, but also in ensuring the quality of their food, and teamwork within the entire restaurant. I once witnessed a small emergency and instantaneously someone from their kitchen ran out to cover the line while another employee assisted the person in need. Tikkaway is a solid 4.5, the only thing they could do is consider an alternate location with more seating as it does get quite busy, and better preparation controls as I've been there twice when my favorite sides are sold out during times of high foot traffic."}, {"review_id": "x63vrGjDmJJd3Ib5nQHC8Q", "user_id": "HkTdOaksgsCwkoatiCl4oQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "There's nothing negative to say about this place.

Authentic Indian food done well and served quick!I came here for a quick bite one night. The options are simple (after you review them) pick a base: rice, roti, salad, and then you choose 1-2 meats and add your veggies/ sauces. They have a lot of veggies and a lot of sauces. But pretty much everything indian is available from the meats to the style of veggies and the sauces that are offered. The flavors are good and to me it tasted like what I know indian food should taste like and i enjoyed it. I must say the best experience I had was my awesome server.

Then, you choose which toppings you want, whether it be paneer, aloo, chana, or meats. Next, you add other vegetable toppings and then sauce. You can choose from korma, vindaloo, masala, daal, madras, or \"Tikkaway sauce.\" Finally, you add cold toppings like spicy chilis, cilantro, cucumbers, tomatoes, chutneys, and raita. All of their food is freshly made daily and packed with good flavours. Their prices are very reasonable and the meal is filling.

What I tried each time was very good (lamb, rice, vegetables, samosas etc.) Since you have to pick and choose what you want, I suppose it's possible to end up with something that isn't quite your taste. Don't do that. Ask the server to help you (they have to be some of the friendliest servers I have encountered - the first time there I got the run down all pretty much all the ingredients that could possibly go into a rice bowl). Taste the sauces first before committing yourself to one. Madras is my favorite though I think it might be on the spicy side for some. One time I did even get a free mango lassi. A bit too sugary for me but again, they were kind enough to give it to me so no complaints here.
