They also have smaller portions if you are not that hungry or need to portion control. Is it authentic? No, but I kind of like the fusion, plus the owners are sweet. But at this place, I would lean towards the Korean vs. the Japanese offerings.To Dos-1) Chapjae. I love this beef bulgogi and sweet potatoe noodle dish. Pure comfort food with your choice of two sides. I would opt for the green beans, chili broccoli, or pickled cucumbers. I'm not a huge fan of the potato salads here.2) Dessert. Yes. Dessert. So often, I never get dessert at Asian restaurants b/c they are generally meh. But this place- it's not the usual affair and they make their stuff in-house. Have a slice of the fruit filled steam cake. It is amazing."}, {"review_id": "XAmIAc07mhhs-2Gy1qxcaw", "user_id": "MlRKjot2_a-LrJPUVQaIaQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "The restaurant was clean and nice set up.  The staff could've been friendlier I think.  I think the food is over priced for what it was.  I ordered sushi and an entree and my bill was $25.  The food was decent, seemed very pedestrian for a $25 meal.  I wouldn't mind paying that much if the food was better.  Higher quality ingredients and better taste for that price I think.  But the place was clean and nice and I think they can get better."}, {"review_id": "EYKGVtkedINoFncc9v3CXw", "user_id": "c14swapig9PTU1lAxmVsmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Stopped in for lunch.

It was right in front of our hotel. We were amazed at the 4.5 star rating with so many reviews and we had to try it out. So good! The California nachos are amazing. The only thing I might do different is order them without nori. I don't care much for the flavor and the hairy quality was just kind of annoying.Great staff. Everyone was so friendly. I wish we weren't 6 hours away. We would be here all the time!"}, {"review_id": "bkGdlwbXAw0hHveMZVi4CA", "user_id": "wpmvnZm41q0NFd20a7B_gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "Definitely top 5 favorite asian cuisine in all of Springfield.

When you walk in, you're invited by a warm sweet smile. You order at the counter and then they will bring your food to your table. I ordered the teriyaki salmon with potato salad (fried potatoes and their homemade dressing) and noodles. It also comes with rice. My daughter is a sushi fan and she ordered the Yoshi Jen roll, I believe is what it's called. She loved it! The price are great for what you get!I attended a graduation and my sister in law had a raspberry cake that was absolutely delicious. I asked her where she got it from and she told me Yoshi Jen! You would've never thought! I ended up placing an order for the cake on facebook on a Monday and told them I will come pick it up on Friday. And oh my word, it was AMAZING. The whole cake was $40. It was a vanilla cake layered with raspberry cream. The frosting is a raspberry whipped topping! They use real raspberries in their filling and topping. Light, fluffy, not too sweet. One of the guys let me sample a slice of their blueberry cake and it was wonderful as well. They had other cakes you could order. I had a great conversation with the owner. She was the sweetest!!I will definitely return to this sweet gem!"}, {"review_id": "5O-Trwq0uFk_cuMTvR0_7Q", "user_id": "QuA2N1gFQKllnVVIdPfQUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/31/2017", "text": "Recently my Facebook posts had several pictures and reviews raving about this place.  They were so good I had to check it out for myself.  I was not disappointed.  The owner Jen greated us as we walked in with friends.  She was so pleasant and genuinely warm individual.  The atmosphere definitely reflected this as well. Very calming yet subtly uplifting colors.  The surfaces had the feel of slightly high end and well placed without feeling showey or pretentious. I would call it warm and trendy. The menu was simple but certainly with enough options that ranged from adventurous to tame. This worked well since half our 4some was more on the tame side.  We felt so comfortable that we immediately decided to simply order everything that caught our eye and all share.  Now between 4 of us we spent close to $130, but that doesn't reflect high prices at all.  Infact most dishes were plus or minus in the $10 range. We simply couldn't stop ordering because it all sounded good.  So that total included wine, jasmine tea, the California roll nachos, 5 entrees and even 2 more we decided to take home for later.  So all in all a huge amount of food for the price!  It was all amazing. Fresh clean flavors you would expect with Japanese food.  Beautiful presentations.  My favorite was the nachos and the Tuna Poke.  The tofu steak was much better then other places I have had in town and the Bulgogi taco was really delicious.  I really loved the Korean pancake as a taco shell.   I hope everyone in Springfield goes out of their way to support Yoshi Jen for many many years.  After finding out they had actually been there already 3 years I felt instantly sad that I had already missed out on this place for so long.  All my friends said they would be very happy to go back and make it one of our regular stops. So I'm sure Jen and her smiling staff will see us again!"}, {"review_id": "idcG75OoEIY02ZqezU85ZQ", "user_id": "_GvAmPu7gNM9OwRJuZ2MVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/2/2017", "text": "Fantastic food, Service, atmosphere, and drinks!!!
