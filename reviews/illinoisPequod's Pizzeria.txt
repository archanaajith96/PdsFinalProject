I LOVE THIS PLACE and I NEVER got around to review it. So today I called to make a call ahead order and I was told they no longer do that. Mind you I am traveling an hour to eat here So I called back and asked if I ordered for a pick-up could I eat it there and his response was that He doesn't see a problem with it especially since they weren't  busy or there wasn't a wait. So I gave it a go I am giving them a 2 star review because the food is amazing but today I experienced the worst management encounter in my life.Upon arrival I told the hostess I was there for a pickup. She walked away to check on my order then when she came back I asked her if I could just eat there since there were MULTIPLE open tables and NO wait. I was told that we couldn't eat our pickup pizza there even though we were going to order drinks and app and of course  tip the server.The woman who spoke with me was very rude and after canceling the order she told me I was able to eat it there. UNBELIEVABLE!Pictures are from my last visit. Obviously not today since we left.Also I brought my cousin who is in from the Army FROM GERMANY to eat here and he was very upset that we couldn't eat here BUT we ended up going to a VERY well known establishment couple miles away for Pizza Pot Pie that he LOVED!"}, {"review_id": "wAkwRYb2tXMb6s06tCIKvw", "user_id": "wNWAhR5lwX8cWsxUQU_6Tw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "The reviews don't lie. The pizza is fantastic. The crust is crispy, charred in some places, thick and substantial. Toppings are generous and large size - meaning when we ordered green peppers, they were thick slices. When we ordered Italian sausage, it was big flavorful pieces. Wait time is what it is. Pequod's is simply too popular to keep the crowds away. Call in your order ahead of time and when you arrive and are seated, then the original 40 minute cooking time will be reduced to 20 minutes. Appetizers are small in my opinion. We had the zucchini slices and it was barely enough for 4 people. Everyone has a favorite pizza joint. This is mine. And I've come from out of town twice to eat here because it's THAT good. If you're a major cheese lover, Pequod's won't be for you because their specialty is the crust. They don't drown their pizzas in cheese."}, {"review_id": "TU9mLJ3jBLLs05Kr_dVSsg", "user_id": "ufco-sxD9Org0AMxagNgQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Still the reigning champ.

The ingredients on the pizza are also top notch, the sausage was flavorful and the basil aromatic after cooking.  The waiters do serve the pizza for you, and do so aggressively so I didn't get a photo of the whole pizza."}, {"review_id": "FbjTyiJLMXuHmoD2Oc5Reg", "user_id": "dZnAKMbB14tXNxPr2GKggw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "By Yelp's standards, 3 Stars = \"A-OK\" which is exactly what Pequod's is.I'm ready to get slammed in my comment section, but that's all I have to offer, nothing more, nothing less.The pizza was not-memorable, other than it was not better or worse than one of it's major competitors (to remain nameless)... literally, I could not tell the difference between the crust at Pequod's and that of it's major competitor who also offers a butter/caramelized crust. Pequod's is hyped as the best Deep Dish in the city, and I disagree. It was A-OK. The prices are very affordable. The sauce is very mild in flavor and could use some more seasonings to make it more robust. You'll wait about 45 minutes for a table for 2, then the same amount of time for the pizza.

With both an upstairs and a downstairs, it was much larger than I anticipated, and insanely crowded. I appreciated that they did an amazing job helping us to party plan. Everything from taking our 20 person reservation to discussing bill breakdown to pre-ordering was above and beyond. Our service was attentive throughout and everything came out quickly and promptly (trust me when I say order ahead, or you'll be hangry waiting 60 minutes for your pizza!). Personal pizza preference for me is the thinner the crust, the better, and their thin crust did not disappoint! Don't fret if you're not a fan of deep dish because this is a great option. Their pan style pizza crust was also delicious; \"burnt\" and crispy, which is just my style. So happy I finally got to experience this Chicago classic! :)"}, {"review_id": "_0Idfk3tIW2sjSPglSKprg", "user_id": "etZl3HWALD5hbYgqfeqy2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Hands down best Chicago style pizza I've ever had!!

WTF have I been doing as a Chicagoan that it took me this long to try you?! I'm not going to lie, I've always been a Lou's loyalist when it comes to Chi Pizza - but y'all are giving them a serious run for their money. First things first, I get this isn't deep dish in our traditional sense, but it dang sure ain't thin crust. It is its own style 'Pan Pizza' as they call it, with a lot of crust and less cheese to it.I think I always overlooked Pequod's since it's a bit more humble in it's building (a two story spot in Lincoln Park with another location in Morton Grove) and also not having a million locations like some of the other pizza chains. Let me advise everyone else, don't follow in my footsteps! Do ~not~ sleep on Pequod's!I tried the Sausage Pizza last night and as mentioned, it has a crispy crust thicker than you're used to while still a bit airy, less cheese, less sauce and a decent amount of sausage on top. It was everything I dreamed it could be - tasty from the first bite to the last. I am a weak sauce and could only shovel one piece down the hatch (and I even struggled with the one piece) but others in my group had 2, even 3 pieces so YMMV. If you go to their actual location, you'll get the pie piping hot & fresh from the oven! But don't front, you may just want to take it to go to eat in shame alone while Netflixing and there's nothing wrong with that. Just be sure to dig in as soon as you can to get all the warm goodness you deserve.I saw online they do a 'Chicago Lunch Special' - $4.95 for a 7\" pan cheese pizza with a drink, Monday-Friday 11am-3pm for dine in orders. Yep, I'll be back for that."}, {"review_id": "p4bccNzSZpStqQEFhoAHRg", "user_id": "vWZbYMFteqB85HlMCA5GMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "My first time here: 2 large pizzas was just perfect for 8 of us (I was a bit stuffed though).

We grabbed drinks at the bar, I was pleasantly surprised to see they had Krombacher on tap.We were seated on the main floor towards the back, but they do have an upstairs that gets more natural light and looks to be a little more spacious. The seating is close-quarters for sure, but nothing super uncomfortable. Frankly, it is a pizzeria that has a bar and is not fancy, pretentious or otherwise, no frills.We kept it super simple and just ordered a large pepperoni pan pizza. We were advised it would take 45 minutes, but it came out in less than 30 minutes, so that was great!The pizza itself was fantastic! As others have said, it is not exactly like other Chicago deep-dish/stuffed pizza. This has a caramelized crust that is crispy enough to add good texture, but not like other deep dish where you need a knife to cut through it. I liked the sauce a lot, it has a little sweetness to it. Really a fantastic blend of what seemed like good quality ingredients. Not skimpy on pepperoni, cheese or sauce, everything came together wonderfully and we had a lot to take home from a large between 3 people. It's filling but I actually would argue not as \"stuffing\" as traditional deep dish.Our server was good, we didn't really need much, literally just ordered the pizza and that was about it.Great spot for a unique pan pizza, nothing but good things to say about Pequod's, I'm a big fan."}, {"review_id": "iClKFM-H3M8PeLBgU5nwjg", "user_id": "2s27wyX1hn2lL1jv5Sn36w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "Just coming back from new york and getting the best pizza there, I had to try out the pizza in chicago.

I didn't taste much garlic and overall there was nothing special about it in flavor or texture. I could've bought a frozen garlic bread and made it better. JALAPENO POPPERSThe poppers were very disappointing because there was no spice or heat to them at all. They were cheesy, but bland. I definitely will not be eating these again.PAN PIZZA- sausage, spinach, green pepper, tomato, fresh garlic, bacon, fresh basil, and italian beefFor a pan pizza, the pizza was thick and not even crispy. It was pretty soggy and soft. It would've been forgivable if the flavors were there, but sadly, not even. I did like the flavors of the meat and veggie ingredients, but the texture and flavor of the pizza itself just killed the whole meal.

Of course we ordered the pan pizza as that's what they're know for! We got sausage, Canadian bacon and peppers on top (pictured). While we enjoyed our pizza I definitely think it's a bit overhyped.

Pequod's never made the list. What a sad mistake it would have been to have missed this place. Fast forward, we are in Chicago, dining at one of our favorite restaurants in the country, when we strike up a conversation with our server. We give him the list, for his take, and he immediately questions why we have omitted Pequod's? We all look at each other and shrug; never heard of it... He went on to tell us that it's the best pizza in Chicago. Well then, on the list it goes. So, on our last day in town, before heading to the airport, we made it in. The hope was it would live up to the recommendation as this would be our last meal in town. And boy did it! The great experience started with the fist call. I asked if they could store our bags (party of four, each with a suitcase) and reply was \"we don't have a spot, but head on down, we'll figure it out\" - love that!We get there and the place is packed! That said, they found a spot for our bags and we were seated within ten minutes. The appetizers were great, especially the fried zucchini and fried mushrooms. The beer selection was great. And finally, the deep dish (extra cheese and mushrooms) was to die for. We hit Lou Malnoti's and Giordani's on the same trip, but Pequod's blew them out of the water.
