It's a darker atmosphere, but I personally enjoy it. I brought my brother and Dad here since they are in town and they weren't too fond of the food but they enjoyed the atmosphere as well. We just got some appetizers and drinks so we haven't tried a lot of their food. I wouldn't recommend the seafood trio though.  Update:I was already impressed with this place, but I'd like to add another review because I was very pleased with the customer service. The general manager, Martin Troy, contacted me about the seafood trio and apologized. I will definitely make it a point to be back and try their other dishes. Thank you Martin!"}, {"review_id": "z1qlPzXHimDNlV862QvvNw", "user_id": "45hkge1GxVr4idPEtgtSJg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "I am really unhappy to have to write this review. We always used to like this restaurant, but the last three times we visited over the past year have not been good. The first time the potatoes had been fried in rancid oil. We let the chef know, and they corrected it. The next time, the potatoes were good, but the macaroni and cheese lacked any seasoning. The third time, the potatoes and mac & cheese were fine, but the fried fish was not crisp and had NO salt, the coleslaw dressing tasted like straight mayonnaise, and the shepherds pie was again lacking any seasoning. We are not people who use a lot of salt at home in cooking or at the table, so you know this was extremely tasteless. Furthermore, the service tonight was curt. Normally, you're asked for your drink order and then when drinks come and you have had time to look at the menu, you're asked for your dinner selection. Not tonight. She wanted our drink order and food together. It wasn't busy, so I'm  not sure what the reason was, but it just seemed curt to all of us. I hope the owners read these reviews and attempt to improve, especially in the kitchen, because the atmosphere has always been great and this used to be one of our favorite restaurants. I'll give it some time and maybe try one more time because we're hopeful."}, {"review_id": "Pwu37EUpi9dI8nf_rEtUew", "user_id": "cby9KcVGucjgLknryHgA_A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "Really, you call yourself an Irish Pub?  I had the worst Ruben sandwich I think I've ever had, sorry.  The curry fries were made with a mustard dressing, very little curry and lots of mayo, pretty bad.  My business partner had the fish and chips, which he said was okay, but a bit soggy.  The restaurant was empty, as their was only one other table in the whole place.  Better options in Colorado Springs, like the Rabbit Hole, one of my favorites."}, {"review_id": "TiIp68tInE9HraJBOk8KOA", "user_id": "OG7EFZwDkcrqyIss9QqSYw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I truly appreciate that the management responded and is working to make the changes to the service.

The service and food was mediocre. They poured us the wrong drink (no biggie). I had the creme brûlée martini which was delicious. We had the fish and chips which were flavorful and the fries were perfectly crispy. I had the farmhouse salad and that was below average, I wouldn't order it again and I'd skip the cheese curds, definitely not worth the up-charge."}, {"review_id": "gTxr13hs8Q8b4uyY3bIYfQ", "user_id": "zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/15/2017", "text": "What a fantastically fun place with some good grub! We visited around 7p on a Saturday night. Even though the place was pretty well packed, they had just enough room for us - four adults and a baby. We got a table right by the stage where a fantastic band was playing some awesome Irish music - was too loud in the best way! We all shared some Appetizers and had a great time. Celtic Wings - We got half BBQ and half maple. Both were your basic wings - nothing special, but very satisfying. Irish Nachos - Fresh potato chips topped with cheddar cheese, shredded corned beef, diced red potatoes and green onions. Served with sour cream and Mary Rose sauce. And that Rosemary Sauce was so good!!!Reuben Fritters - Corned beef, sauerkraut, cream cheese and Swiss cheese, breaded in panko and rye bread crumbs and deep fried. Served with Mary Rose and spicy beer mustard. I asked for extra Mary Rose sauce because I had completely fallen in love. Great service and great atmosphere!"}, {"review_id": "flrpLIbIA7JsFeVz2q2v4w", "user_id": "kztwOpP0SW7JztPSYFMsBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/3/2017", "text": "Tonight was our third time coming here. We just keep coming back here for the comfortable atmosphere, fun bands, and delicious drinks. They have such nice employees here as well.

The shepherds pie lunch special was served in a bread bowl and  included a beverage for $10. The pie was loaded with beef and was not too salty. This item was the best value. The fish and chips were also very good, especially the batter. It was not too thick or greasy.

I remember the great tasting Irish Nachos and had to visit since I was in the area. My friend was skeptical first about the Irish nachos. Once my friend took a bite into the first chip. My friend's taste buds exploded. The Irish Nachos were very tasteful and delicious as exactly as I remembered them. The corn beef, potatoes, and cheese was all well balanced. The nachos also came with sour cream and some in-house sauce that was very delicious. Our server was great. She was very attentive with us, yet not annoying.What made my  visit even better was that I had vegan friends with me and they were able to make a selection for them. They were very impressed with the salads and stated they will visit again.I ordered the shepherd's pie. I was in love with my dinner. I did not want to finish my dinner.  Beef, Smashed potatoes with cheese, and veggies inside a bread bowl were cook right. If it wasn't for me being full, I would of ordered another plate.I definitely recommend this place and will definitely visit this place again."}, {"review_id": "aNo0Oa2MRbCudOmmRQbTPA", "user_id": "tPkH7cxWhVk-w7wAKJUZtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "I never been to the Irish pub before in my life neither I had Irish food. So my opinion is purely based on first time experience. I loved the food and atmosphere, felt like I was in the old book setting. Food was tasty, I got shepherd's pie and it was very filling. They had great service and from what I heard they get live music in the house during certain days of the week. There's no designated street parking, so I the either street parking that's metered or public parking garage  couple blocks over. Overly good experience and I cannot wait to come back again"}, {"review_id": "y8Tw4Xawxk58FvyqA5iQAw", "user_id": "MPiLBHXnUiWvTQRuh36TOQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/9/2017", "text": "I have been to JQ's twice now so it is probably time for me to sit down and write a review.  First things first:  I love the interior.  It looks exactly as one would expect an Irish pub to look but also has loads of private booths and semi-private tables so that you can really enjoy spending time with whoever accompanies you.  It is great.  One thing I will say, though, is that they sometimes have live music and that is kind of terrible because the acoustics really aren't set up for it and it is too loud and just a pretty painful experience.  I experienced this last night and will keep this in mind before any future returns to JQs.The food is really good.  They have an extensive menu filled with loads of lovely options.  I ate there once with some vegetarian friends and I felt like there weren't many options for them but for me, it was endless.  I ended up going with the Irish stew and it was delicious.  Another friend had a bread bowl of stew and I am totally going that route next time because it looked amazing!The servers are all super kind and attentive.  The drink menu is expansive as well and they have plenty of options of beer, wine and spirits.  They also have a small patio which is nice because it is located in beautiful downtown Colorado Springs.  Be leery of the many bums that are in the area, though.  That is a little unnerving but Colorado has an overwhelming homeless population and it cannot be avoided so just make sure you watch your belongings closely and also be warned that you may get asked for money over and over again."}, {"review_id": "7vm8VfbEcnv0kErD4-cAOw", "user_id": "aZjvIzftD1JJHCkyJnFIDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "We made reservations the night prior.

The sauce for the nachos was sooooo good! We took our time and enjoyed before we ordered dinner. Surf and Turf. Medium rare was cooked to perfection. Shrimp was lightly battered and delicious. The staff was attentive but not annoying. Kate kept our drinks filled and always had a smile.  Our table had a perfect view to the stage. This was ideal because were came to see Blue Frog play. We were not rushed at all, we ended up staying about 2 1/2 hours.
