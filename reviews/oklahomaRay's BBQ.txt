To begin, I judge BBQ places by their brisket first. Usually because if you can do brisket well the rest is easy.Theirs is excellent,  perfect smoke flavor, moist and it falls apart. The smoky beans were very enjoyable,  I prefer them a bit sweeter but honestly didn't care that much because they were so good. The iced tea is worth the stop by itself.A special commendation to the counter help. She knew her stuff,  I didn't get the standard, yep, everything is good. She told me exactly how the brisket was that day, gave me a rundown on the ribs and pork as well. You dot get that a lot these days so that impressed me.I don't have a negative thing and that in itself is rare.Well done Rays, I will be back!"}, {"review_id": "fpGjSWEI42FhsKA27SQzHw", "user_id": "fAFV-2NiGmhjUeMa78N6yg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Maybe it was a bad day.  But I was completely disappointed.  The brisket and the pulled pork had almost no flavor.  No seasoning, and certainly no smoke whatsoever.  The \"pulled\" pork was actually chopped, and the pieces were so small they wouldn't even stay on the fork.  The meat tasted like it had been cooked in an oven instead of on a smoker.  It was pretty dry, too.The only thing that kept me from giving just one star was that the fried okra was really good and the beans were very unique.  My son's fries were good as well.  But if you're going to be a renowned bbq joint, this isn't the way to do it.  Definitely not worth $30 or more for two plates."}, {"review_id": "xxmOig_vGDjeIE6m7hLDdA", "user_id": "p0L4FRyYAQUO-fSNbgpPlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Good BBQ.   Found a new love, bbqed Bologna (are you kidding me).  Ribs were good, a nice sauce.  Would recommend.  Good sides, not great.  If you're ever in Norman, OK, check them out.There had a terrible towel hanging from the roof, this took a few points away."}, {"review_id": "nNv9YMOOltzqdUFf4pwm1w", "user_id": "ts3PXAL80WgUNlsVGOkR4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Ray's BBQ hits the spot! I tried this little gem a couple weeks ago and it did not disappoint. Just be sure to bring an appetite! I got a brisket baked potato and some Texas toast. Unlike other places nearby, they load everything up for you instead of putting all the ingredients (cheese, brisket, sour cream, etc.) on the side for you to put on yourself. The brisket was cooked to perfection and flavorful. The sauce however was just average at best hence the four stars instead of five. I do highly recommend to everyone to check out Ray's!"}, {"review_id": "_i0iGnI4ZSaK4juNEp3ccw", "user_id": "i8tYzuRgbBGdJw7XItdBTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Awesome. My husband is a smoke freak and when we got out of the car the awesome smoke smell filled the air, he said \"that's a great sign\". The lady at the counter was so nice and friendly, didn't seem to get inpatient or try to hurry my indecisive husband. We both went for the \"local favorite\" Ray's-the-roof Sandwich  and were not disappointed. The brisket was nothing short of spectacular, it wasn't dry but crumbled and the hot links were so wonderful there aren't words that could describe it. I added some ranch to mine and tried to avoid making \"yummy\" noises as I ate (which irritates my husband).

First, the pulled pork was perfect..simple sandwich, nice smokiness, just moist enough, with some burnt edges for texture, very tasty. Chopped brisket was beyond moist, instead very wet and had less smoky flavor than I was expecting. Cole slaw on the side was a simple one, very saucy, reminded us of KFC's. Fries are beer-battered, our table was split on those, some liked them and some didn't. I don't care for beer-battered fries.Service was fast. They keep a lot of workers in the kitchen to move food. Dining room is OU everything, a local's family-friendly place with plenty of flatscreens with the game on. And they keep a clean dining room and kitchen.I enjoy the Ray's and will surely be back to try more of their menu."}, {"review_id": "4zKI3poJIkg0tryQ-ssWYA", "user_id": "9BTstpY27winNFMrz8qXaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Rays is the best BBQ place in Norman in my opinion!

I ordered the 3 meat combo with Ribs (3), Brisket (sliced), and sausage. The sides are Mac and cheese and fries. The fries were the best thing on the plate. The Brisket was dry and crumbly - had a nice bark and a thin smoke ring but it was just over done. The ribs were tiny - tender, but flavorless. The sausage was moist and flavorful but the texture reminded me of those prepackaged kielbasas from the market - not bad, but nothing like a skin popping hand ground sausage link. The Mac and cheese was very good and cheesy. I hope this was a one off experience because I remember really enjoying their bbq in the past."}, {"review_id": "bPJEy723Hqtc42w9YRzA6w", "user_id": "I5lF-53S5WN4lQM4aOmCWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "Oh my gosh!  This was our first time to Ray's and it was fantastic!  I got the 2 meat combo with sliced brisket and pulled pork.  The brisket just fell apart it was so tender.  The pulled pork was also very good!  I had french fries, which have a coating of some kind but they were good and very crispy!  I also got the BBQ beans!  Not your typical sweet baked beans but more of a bbq bean with a slight sweet and a hint of chili powder!  The hubs got ribs and sliced brisket.  Rib meat fell right off the bone!  Delish!Now, let's talk sauce.  We love HOT BBQ sauce that isn't cloyingly sweet.  This REALLY hit the mark!  It had such a wonderful flavor, a great amount of peppery heat and was just the right amount of sweet(although the husband said it could be SLIGHTLY less sweet.  I disagree!)  I hope you stop by Ray's!  You won't be disappointed and Mr. Ray will probably be there to say hello!"}, {"review_id": "w_t2lFdLVfcp_DHhjcyJ7Q", "user_id": "YVT8qWW7NNY1hmLFx9rCww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Highly recommend!

I was craving BBQ and lucky for me, the restaurant is super close to my house. My amazing fiancé even went to pick it up for me after I called in my order. The lady who answered the phone was VERY helpful as I ordered a 3 meat combo with double ribs (going by the fellow Yelper's reviews!) and the chopped brisket. She asked if I wanted chopped or sliced and I asked which she preferred, so chopped it was. I usually order sliced but this brisket was PERFECT chopped and even more amazing when I added some to their fantastic Mac n cheese!! You get two sides with the dinners plus a slice of their BBQ bread so I had the aforementioned DELICIOUS Mac and also fried okra. The okra was a teeny bit overcooked but that is ok with me since I like it very crunchy....I had a few pieces that were a little well done for my taste but overall it was still a solid side dish! She also asked if I wanted hot or mild BBQ sauce and I asked for both which she was more than happy to do for me! She was SO friendly!! When he went to pick it up he said they offered him a drink while he waited which was really nice as well. Overall we will DEFINITELY be eating Ray's BBQ again very soon!The star of the show was the RIBS!! Yum yum yum, smokey, melt in your mouth goodness with the perfect amount of seasonings on the outside. Forreaaaaaaaaal GET THEM. The brisket was also amazing, AND ORDER THE MAC AND CHEESE. DO IT. NOW. Oh and also: I work at a taco restaurant and ran into Ray a day after this, told him how much I appreciated his food and service and he was the NICEST, like made me feel special and smile and was just the best. I made a comment about the Jets (as I'm a Buffalo Bills fan) and we talked FB for a sec, he is one badA guy. Can't wait to return to Ray's!"}, {"review_id": "FyKIDfftwN0vG8MsI1kk1Q", "user_id": "BWikJ_fJWzdf8Th8PWeMjg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/22/2017", "text": "I've been to Van's, Billy Sim's and Rib Crib, so it was time to try Ray Smokehouse BBQ. It's a very unassuming place, and the construction that's been going on down Lindsey can deter even the most devout BBQ enthusiast, but make the effort. You'll be greeted with the undeniable smoky smell of BBQ, and we were also welcomed by a very nice and helpful worker at the register. She told me they were most know for their ribs and brisket, so I chose the 3 meat plate, with sliced and ribs, along with hot sausage. For my sides, I selected Smokehouse Beans, which I was told was a specialty and collard greens, also recommended. The ribs were as advertised! They came of the bone clean, but didn't crumble, and had really good flavor, any knock would be that they weren't very smoky. The sliced brisket was also good, but very lean, and I prefer brisket more moist. The sausage was sliced thin, and a generous portion and the beans tasted like a sweet chili - which I used as a dip for my Texas toast. The collards were very good! Not bitter or sour, very savory and cooked down well to absorb tons of flavor. I liked it all, but will definitely be back for the ribs."}, {"review_id": "Qtd6LukVTd62N-g5JHFVFw", "user_id": "C-ijLdB6Ekt7XE8f5APsyg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2017", "text": "Delicious food!  We ordered To-Go and it was super tasty.  It must be even BETTER when devoured in person.  We catered brisket, ribs, pulled pork w/ green beans, mac n cheese, and potato salad.  In addition, we ordered loaded baked potato w/ brisket.  Meats weren't dry, tender, and smoked to perfection.  Sides were all tasty.  The mac n cheese was sinful and the potato salad tasted as if my grandma made it from home.  The loaded baked potato was HUGE and plenty to have as leftovers.  Perfect portion of butter, cheese, and meat.  Their catering selection was perfect for the amount of people we had.  Whoever packed our To-Go order, packed it well!"}, {"review_id": "O3u2NAkJlDWgunJRvT_O8Q", "user_id": "3xzqKCX2FVpTates3NwF1Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/3/2016", "text": "The folks in Oklahoma are stuck in between the barbecue holy triangle: Kansas City, Texas, and Memphis.  You figure that could fall one of two ways: the more optimistic is that the region draws from its neighbors' smoked meat expertise, and examples of the best of all three abound; the more pessimistic, and in my experience, realistic, is that the region somehow suffers in a vacuum of poor attempts at keeping up with it's blue-ribbon neighbors.  Unfortunately, my recent stop at Ray's was the third of four in the latter category.I did my homework!  I swear!  We picked Ray's from a list of the TOP 'que joints in town according to Yelp ratings.  This place is pretty highly regarded, according to most other Yelperati.  But, I fear that if this is one of the best on offer, the poor population in OKC is totally in the dark on really great barbecue.I'll start with what I did like: this appears to be set up in a former Pizza Hut building.  For those of you alive in the 80s and 90s, you know what I'm talking about.  It totally works as an attractively-seedy, barbecue dive.  Also, we joined up with a lot of really hard-working OkahomaCitians at the tail end of lunch hour, and it's almost always a good sign to follow the masses of cars during lunch hour.  The smell outside the building told me there was some real, hardwood smoking going on.However, once we arrived to the order counter, the downhill slide began.  When asked for some help and local opinion on some of the menu options, but the order-taker proved she was just that: simply there to punch a couple buttons and take payment.  No help at all, and an a**-kicking frown to boot.So, the three of us ordered a decent selection of barbecued meats and sides, including brisket, ribs, fries, green beans and fried okra.  I'll be honest: the two things that got the least amount of poor reviews at our table were the fries and fried okra.  My ribs were smoky, but lacked tenderness and moisture, and had a very odd, off-peppery flavor to them.  They somehow tasted...dirty.  I wasn't privy to the brisket, as it was on the plates of the other two in my party, but their reviews of it was close to mine for the ribs.  Simply not up to snuff for a near-best-in-the-city barbecue joint.The sauce was actually pretty good, and it's saying something for the barbecue when I tell you that I slathered it all over my ribs.  It helped, tremendously.  Food = 2/5 Facility = 3/5Service = 1/5Ambiance = 3/5Value = 3/5"}, {"review_id": "kCqCHQnLuR4vD_zEDSOsWw", "user_id": "eR16HXZ89vO9gpG3o77quA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2017", "text": "Eat here!
