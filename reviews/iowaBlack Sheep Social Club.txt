I've been back a few times and must retract me earlier review.  The interior is and always was the most spectacular thing in cedar rapids.Fish nuggets are greasy but delicious. Perfectly cooked white flaky fish in a crisp savory breading. Falafel waffle sounds like a three year old put it together because the ingredients are so random but it is actually genius! The waffle is not what you are thinking of, it's more like a flat crispy stroopwafel. Topped with falafel, something similar to coleslaw, and avocado...holy crap I may never order anything see again. All the apps are good. I've tried them all now. They are really greasy and may give you a tummy ache, but you won't even be mad about it.There is a drink on the menu, forget the name, but it's a gimlet with blueberry juice...the best drink I've ever ordered. Wait staff is great, I love this place now. Can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "VIhMsJWuBa27WODp_IL6vw", "user_id": "NQYHPJKTTq6J_iq2wghZ3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Unexpected gem in Cedar Rapids - this MUCH NEEDED venue was a warm welcome home when I came back in December for the holidays. Moving away from my hometown has allowed me to appreciate things that I took for granted about where I grew up, but then there are some things that don't change and that you tend to grow out of when your hometown doesn't evolve at the same pace that you do when you leave home.Cedar Rapids, while holding a special place in my heart, hasn't always had a homey feel. There is a culture that I don't want to overstate, but that dominates and sometimes keeps this place stuck in the past. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when my mom agreed to go to Black Sheep, it was on her list but her picky boyfriend was resisting it. We came during lunch on a weekday and it was perfection. A fresh menu that stands out as a unique offering to Cedar Rapids, but also seems to be tamed a little from when the restaurant first opened and perhaps was a bit too adventurous. The current/new menu offers food that is familiar to the traditional consumer but puts a twist so that you are eating truly unique creations that show off the hometown pride, and a dose of Captain Crunch Cereal.I made it my mission while home, to show my new friends in CA that Iowa is not just a bunch of farmers who are stuck in the times. I think I accomplished this when I heard that many people were surprised of the places I went to and didn't think Iowa had such things to offer. I even had old friends from high school who don't make it back to CR often, ask me where these places were, including Black Sheep.Another great thing is that this place is HUGE I hope that the demand continues to fill the space, but in the meantime, the huge space allows you to be fairly certain that you'll be able to get in and find a table. However, if you ever can't I highly suggest the Map Room! Anyway, back to Black Sheep ---- the place is tastefully decorated but hip and unique. Great vibe, full of energy and a lot of fun, without being a nightclub.Lastly, this place was so good that we made a second visit on my last night home and spotted Ashton Kutcher. I tried my best to get a pic as proof without being obnoxious and disturbing him and Mila, but what a MOMENT! For that reason alone, I'll always have fond memories of this place. Can't wait for Christmas 2018, I'll definitely be coming back!"}, {"review_id": "fMF_uNVBw9w2Ls8LTQ6mAA", "user_id": "a_jH1ewLLYzEfPnKjE66DQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "This place closes pretty early if i remember right..their brewed beer was adequate, nothing that blew off our socks.  The interior is pretty cool with a nice ambiance and industrial feel.  Decent selection of beers and a handful of whiskey, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Good place to grab a few drinks with friends, co-workers, whatever."}, {"review_id": "OCeR3GFHewznbP7jmzo1og", "user_id": "aUOqG0NOJn0hvZuVZgghdg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "Flight landed and I was starving and being a foodie I needed something the locals desire SOOOO I hit up Yelp and found this place! Walked in at 7:10, water arrived at 7:22 and random server took drink order......then food order happens at 7:30 with actual server. Everything sounded amazing and if I wasn't trying to behave I seriously would've ordered like 7 things! Settled on bacon wrapped chicken (on keto diet) with creamed corn (lazy keto) 7:51 the food arrived! So yes you are reading that right 40 mins before I had food touching the tongue. Normally I'm a patient person and don't give lackluster reviews but this was some of the worst time lag I've ever experienced. The waiter admitted to being overwhelmed by another table and tried to redeem himself when I placed food but I still sat for 20 mins waiting for my chicken....Please note that the food was delish AND I will be back to eat through the entire menu! But seeing as this was a Monday night and the place was half packed I just cannot get past the major lag.......PS. I'm writing this review while waiting for check, which took 11 mins to receive. I'm alone and I ordered 3 things! Come here hungry, but don't expect efficient service"}, {"review_id": "1vwrMF6INdBubPBZFUG3bQ", "user_id": "Z1Ce1N6F7vw9pKnsv8MtRA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "I didn't know what to expect in Cedar Rapids and I was pleasantly surprised by the Black Sheep Social Club.  Nice open space, not too loud.  Service was paced well.- The duck fat fries were delicious- The soup of the day (which was gluten free!) was above average (it was a potato cream soup)- My main was the pork chop and it was delicious.  I'm always a little nervous ordering pork chops in a restaurant because many places overcook them, but Black Sheep did my chop perfectly.  Nice crust, tender, with a hint of pink middle.  Very savory- The sides were meh (assorted vegetables)"}, {"review_id": "gJpsOHiTPNUpuVwV5Go9VA", "user_id": "JAHqYASGpqV-xMsKdJNB5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "Posting this again as I originally accidentally posted it to another restaurant....This was the first place I visited while back in CR for a couple days before Chicago. I was honestly impressed. Different from the majority of local options and in a good way. From the atmosphere to the staff, there was that air of a new/trendy restaurant that was on the rise. It was an off time, but the place was still busy (mostly due to the wedding party that was there) and the staff was on-point (and kindly dealt with my eclectic group of friends). The beer selection rivaled most decent places in NorCal or San Diego and the food was amazing. Exactly what I needed during my short stay in CR. Would recommend!"}, {"review_id": "9aYZn8hTfxwRCDMCnp6_DQ", "user_id": "OHUPGzRshOmtNpJQ-xbKTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "This place is fun and designed very nice. Came with a group of coworkers and we had wine and beer during happy hour at a special price. We decided to stay and have dinner.  Their pickle soup, strange as it sounds, was delicious. I had the flank steak Thai salad. The portions were really big.   My group had various dishes and they were all pleased with their meal.  All 5 of us shared the corn ice cream sandwich rolled in caramel popcorn.  It's was pretty good.  The decor through out the entire place is very trendy.  The NBA games were on the monitors in the bar area.  Great place for groups.  Our waiter gave us excellent service.  She was very attentive and made sure she kept on top of our dinner service."}, {"review_id": "IS9pNKpF0JSuBk1HwpE3TA", "user_id": "6a_p-dxIQ6ssmWiGkIHozg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Went for our anniversary, it was phenomenal!

I don't even have much to say, honestly. Their cocktails are superb. They carry a fantastic selection of craft beer (if you're into that sort of thing). The menu is limited, and the prices are a bit higher than you typically see around Cedar Rapids, but it's so worth it. Splurge on the extra couple bucks to add bacon to your burgers. You won't regret it!Their Bloody Mary is phenomenal, and almost a meal in itself. Perfect option on a late Saturday morning before lunch. If you like an appetizer to share, try the duck fat fries. They'll please the whole table!"}, {"review_id": "sQU7QX6jvLsNK7_WC1jvWw", "user_id": "RJXdNV6VDP1YrWmAavL-xA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "The place looks great. Very attractive interior with views of the on site microbrewery. I tried 3 samples of their home brews and settled for a milk stout. Settled because none of them had much flavor. Ordered Surf's Up (a crab topped fish) and a cup of seafood chowder. They were both just not good. Neither had any flavor. Just bland, spiceless broth for the soup and bland spiceless sauce for the fish. Very disappointing."}, {"review_id": "Uy2WgrO65eapCQVD_FaDmA", "user_id": "0yteS6FU0jcBKT9PTCmiZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "This restaurant is BEAUTIFULLY crafted, the food is always changing, the drinks are great, and the service is always awesome!

Walked in and was greeted warmly and seated promptly. The decor is fun, and I imagine after dark it's really nice.Service was good. They had a special - pork belly ramen which sounded amazing. It was a bit of a let down with buckwheat noodles. They were a bit overcooked, which detracted them a bit more. The pork was tasty and plentiful.

I had heard about it from my furnace repairman. We've been talking about ever since. Fantastic!  We each had something different. All were great. My one daughter is a vegetarian. Often restaurant menus don't handle this well. She spends time in Chicago and this beats anything she's eaten there. I ate the rare tuna special. It was perfectly prepared. I finished my \"son's\" pork chop. I picked it up like a caveman. The Captain Crunch fish appetizer surprised us all. I'm going to buy a box to try at home. My second daughter had the salmon shrimp etc. dinner. I'm having that next. I suspect that my wife will repeat her fish tacos. Oops, I forgot to mention the fish chowder. . Our waiter was into flavor \"balance\". He knew what he was talking about. We'll be returning.
