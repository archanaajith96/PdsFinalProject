In 9 years living here, never ate here once, although I was always driving by. Now visiting from out-of-town, ate here for he 1st time, and feel sorry I didn't come more when I had the chance.The company has a flashy video ad on Yelp, and had a poster up in their windows with a great-looking ancient grains bowl with avocado and eggs.  Usually the dish doesn't arrive looking half as good as the photo, but in this case the food lives up to the hype. ALL our dishes, including the crepe, matcha latte pancakes (), the choc. chip pancakes, the eggs Benedict, arrived hot, tasty-looking, and tasty-tasting (is that a word?) AND they have REAL maple syrup on request Service was good and friendly. Glad we came."}, {"review_id": "ct5ydz8Ye0hrgpLP0BubcA", "user_id": "P9XfnmwrU9RJX2G1j1rHyw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I have to say I think three stars for the food is quite generous, at least for the Parma Hash. The rest of our table shared a similar sentiment that their food was just lacking in flavor and seasoning, even basic salt and pepper. Two orders of the Parma Hash, a Chili Chorizo, turkey gravy and biscuits, and a Belgian waffle. Even the coffee is lacking in flavor. The Belgian waffle was the standout dish.The front of house staff definitely make up for the back of house lack of taste. Our server was great and came by to fill drinks frequently.They advertise fresh ingredients, and I'm not doubting that, but I think they stopped short of seasoning.Overall we wouldn't come back which is an unfortunate outcome given our high expectations."}, {"review_id": "UoqxOrg91IoVFN1pJcDIFQ", "user_id": "Obk11sbuX8FARq4ED59XOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Located right down town, First Watch is fresh, healthy and I can't wait to go back! Yes, there was a wait Saturday at 10:15 am, we were told 20 mins and waited 30. But hey it moved quickly and that just means this is the spot to eat at. I didn't see a parking lot, but we were able to get street parking easily. I got the elevated breakfast sandwich and ate it all! :) I like the light mayo on it and it was just good. It's on a brioche bun, so think big. It came with seasoned potatoes and they were great. Also ordered was the farmhouse skillet hash and SoCal burrito, both ladies loved their food. Our server was awesome too! Large portions and healthy food, will always have my heart. I would return for lunch in a heart beat. And I already know what I want!"}, {"review_id": "XavZMQ89J68DFFq7cudM8Q", "user_id": "LMw9tkYi13hmuh94udMolw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Wow ... what an awesome find.  Was looking for a decent brunch after a nice weekend in Charleston before we left for home.

Not the most suitable for the budget-conscious amongst us, but this is definitely a solid brekkie shop. ++Fast service - food was quick to come out, server lady introduced herself clearly, and I personal love that they give you a jug of cold water with the first glass of water.Farmhouse skillet hash - great toast (seedy and oaty, and slightly sweet), good little fruit cup on the side, but the skillet itself was solid with eggs, avocado, potatoes, and cherry tomatoes that looked and tasted like sun-died tomatoes. 5/5Classic eggs Benedict - impressively tender ciabatta with two mounds of ham, tomato, poached egg, and hollandaise on top. A choice of mixed greens and potatoes, and I opted for mixed greens with might vinaigrette dressing. 5/5--What's with the sticky floors? It didn't make for a great first or last impression.We'd love to stop here again."}, {"review_id": "jA4pwcV3bltb3-2DQBlDBA", "user_id": "LecyBjohZL6LW-pXt5PTeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2016", "text": "A few things I'm always looking for when I'm sojourned in a place. One is a good sushi place and the other is a good breakfast/brunch place. First Watch does and excellent job of meeting that need. This place has the feel of a diner with food that comes out looking not at all like diner food. While presentation isn't everything to me, when it looks like the cook put some effort into making things not only taste nice but look pretty, it's worth noting. Had Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict recently, and my first comment when it was sat in front of me was, \"oh, how pretty.\" Food tastes pretty good here also. Because looking good only goes so far, naturally. I've been pleased with what I've had here enough to make it a multiple visit place. And, the wait staff is really nice! So, you've got pretty, tasty food with nice people serving it.

It would be better if the Bacado dish could be warmer.I gave three stars because:- It took about 10-15 mins for our waitress (Ashley) to show up. I forgot if she even introduced herself?! I got her name from the receipt.- it took another 15-20 mins for us to get the cool-warm Bacado dishes. (We ordered two Bacado dishes)- Ashley never checked our coffee. We had to ask for it.- After we got the food about 40-45 mins, she started to ask if we need any box.- We nicely told the cashier what's going on to us. The cashier said to us: We are pretty busy.Did it mean when they are busy we SHOULD EXPECT THE POOR SERVICE?????From my observation, the other tables' waitresses did not provide the poor service at all."}, {"review_id": "Gjros-iefFOnP7JYYw6QpQ", "user_id": "CC0J-rs_7Q12q11EcCJvaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Fantastic breakfast spot, even at lunch!  Great service and delicious fresh food!  Old favorites and new flavors."}, {"review_id": "C-yh759J8B6HvrIDcZ2DNg", "user_id": "DpLInvKgJccMgVvNQJUxcg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/3/2017", "text": "Decided to not pay for the hot breakfast at the hotel and found this place instead on Yelp.    WOW,   great food,  very interesting   offerings.   Love the pumpkin pancakes and oatmeal with   interesting  toppings.    Wish I could try more."}, {"review_id": "L7IP9uePag_iRiLU5GS0aA", "user_id": "Rlr3FACpQZiMIG6iFik7gQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/28/2017", "text": "Went for Sunday breakfast. Only waited a few minutes after signing in. After we were seated it took over 15 minutes for our waitress to show up. It took twice as long to overcook our omelets once our order was taken. Oh, during that first 15 minutes, we just sat there, no offer of coffee or anything. Other than being overcooked, the Baconad omelette was not that bad. Im not sure if i would recommend this restaurant or not, might be just a bad waitress. Asked at checkout if everything was ok, i said no and explained the issues and was told without care,\"well, we were busy\".... really? Busy??? Maybe just not caring.
