I didn't come here for the decor though. This place has the build your own burger thing going on. There are a lot of extras to add to your burger. Some of those extras have an additional charge. The burgers came out fast and had a lot of flavor. The fries were perfectly seasoned. The guy who brought out our food was very nice and accommodating. I'm glad we decided to try this place. No regrets."}, {"review_id": "BvM7ycTKTBv7skgVLFyasA", "user_id": "1nQtLjbRpsBG5DyuEDBYEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Patrick's is honestly the best burger place in town. The handcrafted burgers are huge and have fresh toppings along with their signature sauce. They also serve a large portion of fresh cut fries - nothing frozen here.  I normally order the Coach's Combo and for the amount of food that you receive, the price is just right. The staff is friendly, provide fast service and very accommodating. Each time that I've been in, I have been greeted with a huge welcome and smile. Oh and did I mention that the owner is amazing!"}, {"review_id": "66uzo6bmexwFg32aJ1-zZw", "user_id": "mb5SBYSDexqDHVyUYD9HnQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "The food is tasty. Our fries were a little overcooked, but some of the pictures in the reviews lead us to believe this is their norm. We were asked about 8 times if we were ok, how was everything, and so on...probably 3 of those times were before our food even arrived. We're ok with that, even though it's excessive, but when the person asking isn't making eye contact...ehhh. The issue we had was when I was refilling my cup. I added more ice to it - I like ice - and a couple of cubes fell over. I was then hollered at by a female employee to \"NOT OVERFILL WITH ICE, SIR!\". I'm a female and do very much look the part. So, that was just her way of \"sticking it to me\" without being called out by another employee. And, it was like 3 cubes. Really? I'll pour that ice down my pocket if I want. This just sours our 3rd meal at this establishment and does affect our desire to return."}, {"review_id": "_T_XY_i6r5Bb6Y4wfmPfuQ", "user_id": "30RM2JrfRp6KtQ2B_Kc7NQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/17/2017", "text": "Patrick's was pretty good. A little overpriced for the quality of food. I wasn't super impressed by their burgers but I would go here any day over McDonald's or somewhere similar. The interior is not much to rave about and the staff was nice.

The taste will bring you back. The burgers are huge(my wife and I split one) and comes will a mountain of homemade fries. The meat and all the fixings are prepared fresh daily. USDA Prime Angus beef , freshest vegetables, bought locally. Fast friendly service(the owner mans the grill), pleasant surroundings, reasonable priced. As I said The Best Place in Fort Smith for a burger. It is the juicious burger , a big thick paddy( large, pattied out by hand )your mouth will fall in love . Then your first bite, when the perfectly cooked beef mixes with freshest vegetables, that were chosen fresh just that morning. As I said at the start, Patrick's Butcher Boy Burgers are, in my humble opinion, ARE the best burger and so large, my wife and I are both 5'4\",slim in build, we have to split the burger in half, and we can barely finish(well our three dogs do get a couple of bites apiece) AND the fries, big thick , hand cut fries, cooked golden brown. We, Kelly, my wife( the one that gets the other half of my burger), takes half of the fries also, and I still have more of these great big beautiful fries than I can eat. I do try to eat every single one .....just can't get close to finishing these great fries, I'll keep trying!!! They have three locations, at Green Point Shopping Center on Rogers, West End Park on Garrison Avenue, and their third location is in ALMA, on West Fork Street , if coming from Fort Smith or Van Buren, take a right off of 64 hwy onto West Fork Street. Now roll down your window and take in a breath slowly through your nose and smell, then just follow your nose. Bingo!!! ENJOY MY FRIENDS"}, {"review_id": "jx5Uy20NV0_8HQJl9PLORw", "user_id": "4M1LSg4z6yESCM-SMBXsCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2017", "text": "We visited this hamburger haven at 2 pm on a Saturday afternoon! My first time here. The place was packed with a line to the counter where you place your order. My first thought was, this may take a while! The line moved quickly. This is a traditional hamburger joint, typical sides are standard with opens such as fried egg, bacon, mushrooms etc. Gluten free consists of the food minus the bun, AKA a salad. Prices are typical for what a hamburger cost anywhere in town that is not a fast food chain. The chicken patty was nothing special, the hamburger was very nice. Fries were very good."}, {"review_id": "imY-_Ys6ZVN8onVOnOStbw", "user_id": "C7SuUG90aVtEgRQQT7CuAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2017", "text": "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR FOOD AND SERVICE! Burgers and fries definitely really good - both freshly made! I did not care for the special sauce. Nothing wrong with it, just not my style.Decor sucks. Kinda unfinished and cheap, but your really there for the food, right? They do a have cool fish tank. Bathroom kinda messy. Bummer. Lastly, staff was GREAT!! Very friendly and very helpful. Example: my kids and I were looking for a table to sit at, but several were dirty. The guy bussing tables overheard my daughter suggest a table and my other daughter say that it was dirty. He instantly came over and said \"what do you need, I can do anything you need\"! Very impressive, and there was there were several other encounters similar to this.
