Both trips were for the late night happy hour 9pm-11pm that includes $2 apps, half price pizzas, $1 off 22oz taps, $2 off margarita and $3.50 premium wells. The well whiskey is windsor.Tonight we ordered 'The Funky Hawaiian' and 'The Grinder' (Pictured from right to left). Both pizzas had a soft chewy crust and included delicious cheese and toppings. At half price this is well worth the stop and even have a half pizza left over for the end of the night. Grille 26 is a casual concept of the fine dining experience of 'Minervas' located downtown. Although casual, it has nice decor and ambience making it more of an upscale casual. With that being said, we've sat at the rail both trips being served by a graying middle aged man who comes off just a little pretentious. He's nice and seems to have good intentions, but some may find it unwelcoming or uncomfortable. Sorry, maybe it's just me....Looking for a nice balance of upscale and casual for a late dinner before a night on the town or a quick date, Grille 26 has a good vibe, and delicious food during happy hour that won't break the bank."}, {"review_id": "I-XIuv_TpJYIHEqwNYSMXw", "user_id": "uHByAmOiKGVPBtaTGz46gg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "8/1/2017", "text": "Just walked out. What a disappointment. Ambience felt like a fancy Denny's. But my primary gripe is the food and service. I ordered the pork tenderloin. Arrived luke warm as it evidently had been sitting for some time. The server took it back and after 5 minutes the same plate was put in front of me including the meat I cut in half and sent back. Even the server was surprised. I went ahead and ate part of it. It was of course tougher because of the reheating. Did anyone besides the server apologize?  NO. Anything comped? NO. Will I be back or recommend? NO!"}, {"review_id": "RdOLBah2yYetl6pt3P2OcA", "user_id": "2yJZaf--4QXtMHFNsF3p3Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "I get that this is a super fancy place to eat but Ive had better steak at texas roadhouse or outback for half the price.

Brunch was a three-course meal, which included assorted salads, an entree, and various desserts in a nice buffet-style set up. Everything-- and I'm not kidding-- EVERYTHING we had tasted good. We all got different dishes, which worked well for sampling purposes. Of course I was already stuffed by the time the entree arrived, because I'd loaded up on the delicious apple-spinach salad (what the **** do they put in that honey balsamic vinaigrette!? It's amazing), but that sure didn't stop me from trying some of everything. Fluffy eggs. Juicy, succulent turkey. Fresh, crisp veggies. Perfectly-cooked steak kabobs. Gooey, rich delicious stuffed French toast. And at the end, a smorgasbord of caramel, raspberry, orange and chocolate-infused desserts. Hours later, we were still shaking our heads about how good it was. Great food, great service, definitely worth making a trip out to Sioux Falls."}, {"review_id": "072ILeU2ouxMnBjStgwgcg", "user_id": "OVILP2Ieq_FscTmSHFsk3A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/1/2017", "text": "I've been here many times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with our family. My parents like it, and the fact that they continue to return should signal that it's not terribly awful. Basically, you won't be greatly disappointed if your expectations aren't too high.Grille 26 offers a nice atmosphere with both a restaurant area and bar area. We usually sit in the bar, and there is a nice selection of beers on tap and wines. The menu is diverse, but there's nothing I've had here that I've really been amazed by that I would rush back for. The service is generally pretty good, but the food is very average and there's definitely some things I've ordered that I would categorize as 'bad'.

I came on a Sunday early afternoon and was not crowded and the music in the background was soothing. A good place to stop by with friends or family.
