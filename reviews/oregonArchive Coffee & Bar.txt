Even with the massive space, it still has that intimate coffee shop vibe. Super cozy.The beverages range from specialty coffees to good beer and wine. I haven't tasted enough to really leave a detailed review, but everyone just looked fantastic.I am looking forward to another visit here in the upcoming months."}, {"review_id": "lZRz55unXN3LdWbezdgh6g", "user_id": "tTgkdttgCt1jJf0saRt7tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "The Americano was good; that was alI tried so that's all I can review.The ambience and environment was really cool, has a Sherlock Holmes/industrial vibe to it"}, {"review_id": "C4-PaDxbgD4KmmWvZFoI4Q", "user_id": "xJJtbRSPnBq3kswvG6S6vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Tasty food and tastier cocktails.A group of us went there on a Wednesday afternoon and got good service, despite not letting them know in advance that 10+ people would be showing up (bad form, I know).Definitely recommended."}, {"review_id": "Qz0kpx9UHltmQmyeTmV99Q", "user_id": "913pletrqTEfmSyOVB1ddQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Nice and open, but expensive for what you get.

You can tell they are passionate about their craft here. The Bee's Knees was amaaazing. I've had a number of lavender lattes in my life and this one is top-ranking. Very good! The Blanket Fort was also really creamy and luscious. I love their range of coffee and tea drinks. It's such a great vibe in here. And the menu is awesome.

I have obviously been quite remiss in not writing one. But nice that it will be a milestone review, my 300th.  This place is really great, love their special beer tastings and Saturday Speakeasy in the \"secret\" room, amazingly creative cocktails, even incorporate smoked cedar and other woods in a few.  If you tell them your favorite type of distilled spirit they will even come up with a \"revolver\" that best brings out the character of the chosen spirit.  Menu is small with well prepared food and they have changed it up a few times to keep things interesting.  One of the places that is really helping downtown Salem grow into a desirable night out destination."}, {"review_id": "eQorsbt6nY6H5US82Lk7Hg", "user_id": "EMtnoJjS10aiVGL4TqrJZQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "Honestly unimpressed... the variety of food and drinks looked interesting but not at all adaptable. They didn't have alternative milk I could have for a hot drink and there wasn't much room unless we took up an entire large table to the two of us. It looked very nice, clean and chic inside but was full of let down. The star is for the venue alone and atmosphere. The food and drinks I couldn't try and the service lacked entirely. There was no greeting or explanation of where the menu was and when we asked for one we were initially ignored and later given a menu but they seemed to busy to be bothered with questions. They usually do a dress up night each month for mingling, which sounds fun. They are definitely hipster trendy rather than welcoming and accommodating like other locations downtown. I recall when they first opened it was all the buzz and lots of hope for more portland-ish locations in Salem but it came with the snobbery too it seems, unfortunately."}, {"review_id": "VgfB1fGpR1yJVgtUpX_qww", "user_id": "PLAziinmigKZX1L1AnZIcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Only 4 stars ???? 6 stars would not cover it.

They were pretty good.  Margaritta was good as well The service was average.  But the price was way higher than it should have been for what I received. My bill came in a book.

It has its own special kind of ambiance. I've been here twice, once in the morning for their gluten free donut holes (a must try!) when the place seemed only slightly hipster and mostly \"regular\", and then once in the evening. The evening was super interesting, as they have speakeasy. If you come here you must go down to the the speakeasy! They only allow around 20 people down there at a time, and you have to ask to go down to the speakeasy. The speakeasy is a very dark room decorated in $1920's decor. It has its own bartender and drink list. I think the cheapest drink is $11 and it ranges up to an $80 scotch if my memory doesn't fail me here. The drinks we had were very good. They are definitely high grade mixology. Upstairs the drinks are still spendy and high quality, but the staff are very unique. I definitely felt \"old\" there, like I didn't really belong. It's hard to explain, but I'm trying!This place is definitely worth the trip, at least for the experience. I would go back if friends suggested the place, and I might even try it again for dinner or my morning joe. I think I'll leave the nighttime drinking to those much much cooler than me."}, {"review_id": "sU8t31JJa6PQSf4L1UA6BQ", "user_id": "zxnrA6y-oMBKs0j3dMxBng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Pros:Clean, awesome selection of spirits, good coffee, cool set up, friendly staff.
