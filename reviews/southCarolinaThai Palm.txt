Aside from the few tables in the front area, the majority of the restaurant extensions in a straight shot done what feels like a corridor to the back, two tops on the left and buns that seat for on the right.Tight dining arrangements aside, the food was delicious. I ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken and found the noodles to be perfectly tender, the chicken moist, and vegetables to be crunchy and fresh. Just the right amount of flavor at a good price. A good choice for someone looking for Thai food in the area for dinner."}, {"review_id": "Jtniex4ziubuv2RF9CYh6A", "user_id": "Ez8G5x9F5YTvYQFk4apNPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "First time ever ordering Pad Thai & it was so good I decided to order take out the next day for my drive back to Virginia.

I'm happy to admit I was wrong. They had the best basil rolls I've had in a long time. They were wrapped perfectly, they didn't fall apart halfway through. The red curry was delicious and a great portion. For my husband he did a beef Pad Thai and some dumplings. He liked the Pad Thai because it was different than the usual we find, it wasn't as sweet as others which he enjoyed. I love the location they have, it's outside of the outlets so you don't have to mess with that traffic in the parking lot at busy times. Plus it's seconds from the airport, when we went I was catching a flight so we had dinner together before my husband dropped me at the airport. It worked perfectly!"}, {"review_id": "6nfxM_-hKQVTukH94TMGUQ", "user_id": "osYJaXyIjy3uxCU89Lv9Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Thai Palm is so good I went back to back!!! The same lady was there both days and she teased me about coming back the second day! It's conveniently located near the outlets (in front of Conn's) so why not take a break while shopping?!?! Ive gone Friday evening and Saturday afternoon, and Friday was very busy but the food still came out timely even though I walked in and placed an order. Each time the food was hot and tasted great and the service was great! I've only gotten three things on the menu so I'm going to keep coming to try new things! I can strongly recommend the pad kee mao, crab fried rice, and tom yum shrimp! It was all amazing!"}, {"review_id": "Fsatrhm1Pm3wYPrx0J0zoQ", "user_id": "t2-qSwJvocqMMu0K8jHBGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "We come for lunch and always love what we order.

We were staying near the airport for a night and were looking for a place to eat that wasn't a chain restaurant and on the healthier side. Thai Palm has classic Thai foods for reasonable prices which are extremely delicious. The Food:- Thai Fresh Spring Rolls: A lot of times you'll get a spring roll and the wrapper will be a little hard because they've been sitting out for some time- this was not the case here! The spring rolls were delicious and the peanut sauce was perfect.- Tom Yum Soup: I got the bowl of Tom Yum, probably should've upgraded a size since I was a little hungry after finishing.- Pineapple Fried Rice: Can't go wrong with fried rice! This one had a nice curry flavor to it which was a nice surprise."}, {"review_id": "DVustyep3OZm0fTjkHc29A", "user_id": "uvmXdoWGAix3caq2LJ7lVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "This place was great. I wasn't in a big mood for thai food but my partner was and I am so glad we came here! My partner got the Pad See Ew with tofu and I got the basil fried rice with tofu, which might not sound exciting, but was really, really good. Thai basil adds such an interesting dimension to the dish. The veggies were also fresh, plentiful, and not over cooked. The portion sizes were great and tofu was also plentiful. Also, service was friendly and efficient and our food came out really quickly! Looking forward to coming back and exploring more on the menu."}, {"review_id": "dl4jDUh51zuVHgFb4OfX9Q", "user_id": "rk2ZkhhideZxVOdXNFQl5w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/11/2017", "text": "This is a solid Thai restaurant. I'm rating it 4 stars, however depending on the chef at the time, the rating would definitely be closer to 3 stars. There's a noticeable difference between the dishes when one of the chefs is there versus the other - one being noticeably bland and lacking flavor which you can see also within the coloring of the dish. However, based on the best of the food I've gotten, I'll give it 4 stars. I usually get the pad see ew which is flat noodles with carrots and broccoli. I get it with added spice, usually a medium amount, to give it a good zing but not too much to overwhelm. Again, this is usually tasty when the right chef is there, and the portions are large regardless. Overall, I'd pay a visit if you're craving Thai and it is nearby."}, {"review_id": "eXZvYLl7AK-to6zafapADQ", "user_id": "vuKPCCTM1AyHxPoYkhSlPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "Best Thai I have had 'round these parts.  Friendly people, fast on the table.Nuff said."}, {"review_id": "c6_AtGqY7NRl-FFw0DyfvA", "user_id": "BXyrdlcvyUzySZQ2XhCIwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "This is probably my favorite Thai place in town.

The dumplings were deep fried and ok, would have been perfect if they were pan fried. The shrimp rolls and pho were good also. It's a step above greasy take out for sure and looks to be family owned and operated, which I always prefer. Struggled with 3 or 4 stars because they are a solid 3.5. Good when your in the area, but not great enough to take 26 to get there.

If you have been to Thailand and you love Thai food, this is by far the most authentic one I have had in the South Carolina area. Pad Thai is perfect, seasoning just right, fried just right. The duck is magnificent. And you have to try the mango sticky rice when it is available. What's better, they have the true Thai spicy. If you are not a big fan for hot and spicy food, order the mild version of everything and you will not be disappointed at all.
