The food is amazing, the drinks are perfection, and the atmosphere is really unique. You start off with a free \"palette cleanser\" which is really just some flavored slush-ice that you can add complimentary vodka to. They also provide chips and some salsas to start off. The restaurant serves only small plates/tapas, so be ready to share with your mates and order a lot and eat a lot. We got the queso, and it is really really great. Another must is the grilled street corn with spices and cheese on it - something I always get at Mexican restaurants. We also ate some tacos and churros, which were very, very delicious. At the end of your meal, you also get complimentary cotton candy with popping candy on top to enjoy. The only downside is the price. We paid about $100 for two people for dinner and drinks, which is a little on the pricier side, but you can definitely budget yourself if you try."}, {"review_id": "Lby35Vk-b3KuKuxZFGFiGw", "user_id": "jFIKJCzbllXXsTxWCeC6aQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "The food here is good - the tacos are delicious, and you can't go wrong with the guacamole sampler or street corn appetizer. The only reason I give it three stars instead of four or five is because it's too loud, busy and dark. It can be really tough to get a seat, and the bar area is really small. And while the food and drinks are good, there's lots of other Mexican places in the area that have better prices and don't have this problem.If you want to try out Lolita's, I recommend checking out the Fort Point location instead. There's much more space! And if you do end up going - watch out for the diablo margarita. I love a little spice, but this one was too hot for me!

Be prepared for a leisurely dinner- my friends and I ended up eating and drinking over the course of 2.5 hours.  For my friends and I, Lolita was a place we had been trying to eat dinner at all semester. Walk-in waits are usually upward of 2 hours, so it's the kind of place you HAVE to make reservations for on the weekend- sometimes at least a week in advance. It's just that popular. The three of us were able to snag reservations for dinner and drinks on a Sunday night at 6pm.We were pleasantly surprised by the dramatic start to our dining experience with a complimentary smoking fruity ice dish that comes with an optional shot of tequila. They call it a palette cleanser. We were also provided with complimentary salsa and chips (yum!). At the end, you get giant cotton candy with pop rocks! Lolita serves up (relatively) small plates, so you and your party can share and enjoy many different dishes. My favorite thing we ordered was the elote, or Mexican street corn. We also ordered this tuna carpaccio dish, cornbread, guacamole and chips, and tacos. My friend and I agreed that the crispy carnitas tacos were pretty average and that we would rather get tacos elsewhere. I would definitely recommend filling up on other dishes. Overall, Lolita is a great treat (you can easily rack up the bill here) and a really fun time, made even better by all the complimentary food. Would highly recommend both for drinks and dinner!"}, {"review_id": "CMKm8wa7-_MiC_-EKDV4YQ", "user_id": "Tlv3kXIGp5Dt8gNOxGqpfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update: the menu has changed a little to include more veggie options, which is not one of my go-to's when I'm in the mood for Mexican, but everything new we tried was delicious (of course).

We ordered the sampler guacamole for the table and you can't really go wrong with that. They also brought us the complimentary chips and salsa too. I had the mini mushroom quesadillas as my meal.

The service however is horrible.My crew and I got here at around 10pm or so on a Friday night and there was a line to get in. I think we had to wait in the cold for like 20 min or so before getting in. We're from CA so we were dying outside and needless to say, we had high expectations.When we got in it was super crowded with pretty much nowhere to stand and talk so we decided to get a table. To get a table, you have to order at least one food dish so we decided to get some dessert and drinks since we already ate dinner.We ordered the churros and dulce de leche and when our waiter brought us food she forgot the utensils and napkins. I literally had to get up and tell another waiter to get it for us and still no to avail. Finally our server came around after like 20 min and brought us utensils. As her excuse she said the tables are normally set with utensils which is why she didn't bring it. I hate it when people make excuses, just bring the forks bitch.The churros were delicious, i think there were 3 large sticks with a decadent chocolate dipping sauce on the side. The dulce de leche was also super good.At the end they give you a super huge cotton candy with pop rocks on top. I couldn't stop eating it but had to force myself to stop.

I came because I heard that Mondays are for margaritas and many tacos. It just so happened that I brought my friends here on the one Monday (Marathon Monday) that they did not do this taco deal. Ultimately I still ordered their fish tacos since we were already there. The grilled mahi was incredibly moist and flavorful. I was deciding between this or the fried chicken tacos but our waitress warned me that the chicken ones were fire. The spicy kind, not the lit kind. Anyhow, the service isn't too bad. I've been here a few times now and none of the waitresses seemed particularly enthusiastic, almost as if they know this place is poppin so we should just be glad we got a table.

The first time I tried to eat at this place, the walk-in wait was 2 hours!! Definitely make a reservation if you want to try this place. There's a good reason for the long wait time, and that is because this place is bomb. First, they gave us complimentary granita and offered to add tequila to it (we obviously did). You get unlimited chips and dip!! I loved every appetizer we ordered!!! I got the corn bread, empanada, corn elotte, and the carne nachos. The corn bread was amazing!! It was served with this buttery sauce, which prevented it from being so dry. The empanada and their sauce was delicious! The carne nachos were good, but the meat itself was a little too salty for me personally. My boyfriend and I also ordered some mahi mahi dish tacos and carne tacos. The fish tacos were a little too salty for me.. The drinks were popping!! We got the don diablo margarita and the watermelon mango mojito! The churros were the best I've had so far. If you like your churros crispy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside, then definitely don't skip this!! The service here was the best. Our waitress Camila was super friendly. She had noticed that I didn't eat my fish tacos and asked if there was something wrong with it. I told her that it was too salty for me, so she took it off our bill! Which was extremely nice of her and the manager to do that! Not many restaurants will do this. I work at two restaurants, so trust me on this. Everyone gets a complimentary cotton candy with pop rocks mixed in it too. The cotton candy was literally bigger than my head!

I went here during a trip to Boston to celebrate my friend's birthday! We chose this place because we like Mexican and it had good reviews on Yelp. Got their empanadas; shrimp tacos; street corn; and chorizo gorditos. The flavors were complex and a nice balance of sweet, salty, and acidic. One thing that I was especially impressed by was their level of spice even in the complimentary chips and salsas. Typically, complimentary items are spiced for the average consumer (read that as: mild and potentially bland) so that most people at the table can consume them. Lolita didn't baby my palate. The dips were spicy and jammed with fresh herbs and seasonings. Yum! As some others have noted, the service (in terms of staff friendliness) is a bit mediocre. Their tones & body language tend to be a bit harsh (e.g., some one asked the bartender a question and the answer was proceeded by an eye roll). However, the food came out fast and the decor is trendy!

I loved the vibes, the food, and the drinks. Literally everything was great whenever I came here. Until the last time I went.I stopped by last week with a friend, ecstatic about the idea of rekindling the excitement I felt about Lolita during my college years. The food was pretty good and our waitress was pleasant and very accommodating. The issue I had was with the women in the front. Can y'all learn how to smile and be nice? As soon as I entered, I was greeted with an attitude. Honestly, that would have put me off after entering if I didn't already have a reservation. I don't think I've ever been greeted at a restaurant with such an attitude. I walked in, expecting at least a \"hi\" or a \"welcome.\" Instead, I got a blank, cold stare from one of the girls. When I told her I had a reservation for 7, she simply ignored me. The girl NEXT to her, who also didn't look up when I walked in, mumbled \"name?\" I was waiting for my friend and she told me I needed to wait for my friend to come to be seated. Fine. My friend came in and was not greeted as she was walking in (same experience I had). Again, the hostesses just simply stared and when I mentioned that we were ready for our table, they just stared and started walking towards the seating area. Honestly? Is it that hard to say something simple like \"Ok, follow me?\" I was so put off by the whole experience. Hey Lolita, your food is great and I love your ambience... but you need to start hiring people who actually know how to handle customers. I don't think I'll be returning any time soon.

The only 5-star of the trip (spoiler alert) and man was it a great bang to the end of the trip. Ambiance. So cool. Darkly lit as if you are part of some cool underground club, mainly because it is partially underground. Great decorations and I am not usually influenced as intensely as I was by ambiance.Cornbread: tres leches esque. A delicious creamy sauce saturated every bite and cornbread was dense yet light to the stomach.Three guacamoles: The bacon bits in one were a perfect salty/fatty addition. The only one I did not like was the shrimp because... shrimp is gross.Ribs: These were not my favorite. The flavor was there, spice, a little smokey, and a little sweet, not a whole lot of meat on the bone. Gorditas: Mmmmmmmm... the bread was yummy and the filling was even better, the only shame was there were only two of them and four of us, so we had to split them. Nachitos: Great cheese to other topping ratio. Peppers here and there to wake up your taste buds and an overall perfect execution of nachos.The tacos: steak money. Perfectly cooked with the right amount of char. The carnitas were so good, I tried a little bit of the habanero mango salsa on them and it just took them to a whole new level of a mixture of flavor.Dessert: We had all three. The only one I didn't LOVE (love being the operant word) was the chocolate cake thing. Churros were perfectly cooked both the apple and chocolate dipping sauces were amazing. 4 leches. Up there with the best of the leches family of desserts I have ever had.THE VERDICT:It has the stars it does for a reason. This place delivers on ambiance, service, and food. I didn't even have any cocktails which I am sure were delightful... oh yeah their grilled pineapple drink was so refreshing with the meal. Our server was a class act. And we felt like kings among men while we were eating. Do I sound crazy? Well I should because this food drove me to the deepest depths of flavor of which I may never escape.

This place was fairly close, so here I went. That, and I've been meaning to check it out.If I opted for a table, I would have ended up waiting for about an hour. Thankfully, there was a seat at the bar. While the bar does have the full-service menu, there are a couple words of warning... but that'll come later.About the food... and bear with me here for a second. I heard the B.B. King could play three notes that would bring you to tears. What I mean by this is that even if you have three flavors mixed perfectly, you have the potential for something amazing. This describes the food here in a nutshell (tortilla shell?). Not a whole lot of notes, but an appreciable harmony. I had the opportunity to try the empanadas, carnitas tacos, and fish taquitos.But first, you have the free chips and salsa. Chips were perfectly seasoned and terrifically large! Rather than try and fight the urge to double-dip, ask whoever you're with if it would be okay... they'll probably be relieved as they were thinking the same thing. There are three salas that come with them, a tomatillo, red, and hummus-like one. The hummus one was one of the more interesting ones, great texture, and spice! Interestingly this was the spiciest one of the plate. The other two were good, but I would have liked a little more to differentiate them from one another. Making the red salsa a little chunkier and spicier would be a great possibility.Beef empanadas were awesome! They were as fresh as they could be, since they were screaming hot! Proportion of beef to breading was pretty good too. Meat flavorful, and the sauce they come with is out-of-this-world. It adds a wonderful, refreshing acidity to the dish. Two criticisms, however: the Pico de Gallo was quite acidic, and the cheese that is supposed to be inside didn't shine through.As for the carnitas tacos, while they were on the small side, especially for the price, they hit [almost] all the right notes. Meat was wonderful crispy and flavorful, some of the best carnitas I've had. Also, while the tacos are small, they don't skimp on the meat! There is also some onion and cilantro, and some wonderful sauce that ties everything together. Surprisingly, the tacos were still perfectly holdable, and didn't fall apart immediately. Remember what I said about B.B. King? It doesn't take a whole lot of notes, you just have to know how to play them. My criticisms in regards to these is the value. While they were terrific in flavor, two small tacos for the price I paid seems a bit steep. Sure, this place isn't cheap, but the tacos is where I felt the biggest impact on my wallet. Taquitos continue the trend of hitting a few notes just right. These were crisp, hot, and like the rest, came with a wonderful sauce! There was a balance of the shell and filling also. My note, and take this as you will, is that the filling could have been a hair-and-a-half fishier in flavor).For drinks I was able to try the Lolita Margarita and the Broken Heart. The Lolita margarita was delicious! All the flavors combined to make perfection. It had the perfect blend of sweetness, sourness, bitterness. It was strong too, but didn't have too much of that sharp tequila flavor. Broken Heart on the other hand was sweeter than anything else, and didn't taste as strong (although reposado tequila does not have as sharp a flavor)Finally, the warning about sitting at the bar:First. people are going to be reaching over your food to get their drinks. Second, you do not get cotton candy or the tequila shaved ice. Well, maybe you do, I didn't ask. The service was fairly quick, especially considering how busy it was."}, {"review_id": "uWznJbkBXAjQcZM74n2i2w", "user_id": "4inTvIPTCelpsuWI0s7Bog", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Everyone RAVES about Lolita but let's examine: besides the free ice shot and cotton candy, is the food really that high quality?

A group of four of us made our way on a cold winter night here with reservations. We did have to wait a few minutes even though we were on time, but it wasn't too bad. The restaurant is one of the most interesting in Boston (I struggle to find interesting restaurants in the city....compared to NYC or Philly...). First, we were given a cool dry ice sorbet with a splash of tequila as a palate cleanser, and then the chips with salsa arrived! I preferred the queso-looking salsa - our waiter said it was super spicy, but it wasn't too bad at all. We also ordered the bacon guacamole (which wasn't free, unlike the salsa) - the bacon was SO DELICIOUS!! 6 stars for the margaritas, seriously. Our dining partners ordered a pitcher of the white lie margarita (they only serve pitchers of non-frozen margaritas), which we tried a bit and they were so delicious. I'm also a fan of frozen margaritas though, so my fiance and I split a passionfruit and a frolita. The frolita is definitely a more typical margarita, but I preferred the smoothie-like taste of the passionfruit. And, I could definitely tell it had plentyyyy of tequila even though it tasted like a smoothie!! The food was just fine. I actually really didn't like the mahi mahi taco or the pork carnitas. My mahi mahi was a think chunk of fish rather than the shredded fish I'm used to, and the pork carnitas (along with a few other dishes our table had) were much too salty. But, we finished with some complimentary cotton candy (which was delicious and didn't taste sickly sweet like normal state fair candy!), so really the restaurant is sold on its drinks, cool experience, and overall ambiance. FINALLY, our service was amazing!! We loved our waiter, we wish we got his name.
