Perfect to cure a hangover. Portions are ridiculously huge! You can share a combo with 3 people. They're awesome here and always add an extra piece of fish, chicken, and shrimp. The half size of fried green tomatoes were huge! You definitely get your money's worth here. Also looove the sweet tea"}, {"review_id": "T3gvhGu6H3SgjEdZtXoBVg", "user_id": "Nts66VewUuOTyL9YBL7wUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Warning:  Do NOT step foot in Sam's unless you are HUNGRY!  For lunch I ordered a platter that included four pieces of fish, four shrimp and hush puppies, and for my sides I ordered the fried okra and dirty rice.  The grilled fish and shrimp were seasoned SO well that I completely forgot to try the  bottle of Louisiana hot sauce that was tempting me as we waited (briefly) for our food to arrive.  The okra was good, though not bursting with flavor, my dirty rice was a delicious accompaniment to the fish (soaking up the savory buttery juices), and the hush puppies had a pleasant kick as a result of the jalapeño bits included within.  But what impressed me most was the size of the four pieces of fish--I honestly could have cut the order in half and still had plenty for my lunch, but of course I went ahead and slammed the whole meal down like a champ (for good or bad, my mother taught me to always clean my plate).  Oh, and as an appetizer we ordered the fried pickles--they were perfect and plentiful!  I would recommend that you get your seafood grilled as opposed to fried (there are plenty of side items and appetizers to order fried, and too much of anything(s) fried can lead to late afternoon gastric issues that your co-workers would rather not experience).  But however you decide to roll, get in to Sam's and give it a try."}, {"review_id": "nB0UZ7eKAcwtP-LFyJNbaw", "user_id": "BR468r5W2g3adrfYQpI5ew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I always stop here when driving though Shreveport. 6 or 12 piece jumbo shrimp is absolute must"}, {"review_id": "6Gket7IGgTSt_UvIfXuZaQ", "user_id": "OytIInT02HbpOgiEfQX7BQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Awesome!

This location has the best dining area & I think makes the best food. The red beans & dirty rice is amazeballs. When I'm passing thru, I always have to stop here for the red beans & dirty rice & I always get two to go. It's that good. My hubby likes the shrimp. He likes fried shrimp like Bubba Gump likes shrimp :)...I also like the shrimp, however, I also LOVE the oysters & the catfish. I LOVE that they have the regular catfish filets but they also fry up the WHOLE CATFISH, bones, face & all. It's so good that way. Not a lot of places do that. My only complaint is that they don't use the authentic Gambino New Orleans French bread for their p'boys. P'boys never taste as good without the fresh baked bread by Gambino's Bakery. It's Crispy on the outside with a flaky, paper thincrust and light on the inside. Makes a perfect p'boy. Please order the right p'boy bread & I will update my review ;) Will return."}, {"review_id": "10xK5grwH-PF0HbwtlOhDA", "user_id": "phDxT9j-FHgoQJjOdlwYZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "I found this place on my way out of Shreveport.

No matter how good the food was (and it was good), gum in a Philly cheese steak sandwich is no accident. It looked like cheese, but it was MINT GUM. I told the person at  the counter and she took it off the ticket. I think the whole meal should have been free. Other than that, the food tastes good and was reasonably priced. They gave us an extra fish and shrimp on the platter (this is normal from what I hear). Service was good, too. Unfortunately, I will never go back.
