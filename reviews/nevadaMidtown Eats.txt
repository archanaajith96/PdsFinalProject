Their menu is limited, but the food they do offer is absolutely amazing.Willing to accommodate my picky pallet - w alterations & they don't make me feel bad about it ;)  ALSO, They can remember to bring the ranch on the first trip! I appreciate that, as no where else can seem to rmbr to bring it with my food.

We happened to come during brunch but I wasn't really in the \"brunch\" mood. I was surprised by how limited their menu was - only a dozen options or so. Not feeling \"brunchy\" - I decided to order their Midtown Burger. It was a classic burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion. The burger was average - nothing spectacular. It was served with a heaping pile of french fries that were tasty - but again, nothing spectacular. Perhaps I ordered the wrong item - or I should have given their brunch menu a chance, but I wasn't blown away by Midtown Eats."}, {"review_id": "8RsqFBxHze-OpgHXDb9cUA", "user_id": "BiLX0Yc3vNJjVNLocBJyHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "We stopped in here about 12:30pm on a Sunday. The outside of the building gives no indication of the inside. It's a simple building in the heart of midtown. Once inside there is a cool industrial feel with simple furnishings. There is a large bar and counter area with tables of various sizes throughout. We opted to sit at the bar and were asked to wait just a minute while she prepared our spots.  She came back quickly and walked us to our places. There were white linen napkins placed on the counter with a carafe of water and jars for drinking glasses. We checked out the menu and were a little surprised to see the price of a burger at $16 which is definitely on the upper end for us for a burger. The burger offers your choice of a side salad, fries or sweet potato fries. We both ordered the BBQ bacon burger.As we sat at the bar we admired some of the details such as the light and shelving and noticed that you can see into the kitchen slightly.Our food arrived in a timely fashion and looked amazing. They tasted just as awesome.Overall, a great experience."}, {"review_id": "Dtp4BXvGODnmF8zUImd8zg", "user_id": "1clgMIAD7iAy-VHrwK99Pg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/26/2017", "text": "The food here is always good.

We only had to wait a short time for a large table.For the game we had bacon and brown sugar popcorn with an Elijah Craig bourbon.  Both were amazing. As this is one of my favorite burgers in town, Gregg and I split one of those and I also had a blonde draft.  I noticed they have the peanut butter stout on the menu from Belching Beaver so it's a pretty robust draft menu. I was so excited to have my husband and friends try Midtown Eats for the first time because it is one of my favorite lunch spots.  Again, score one for the Whiskey Hunt to take us out of our collective comfort zones!Midtown Eats is a great place for a comforting lunch.  The waiter was nice and took our order quickly and our food came out in no time.The atmosphere in this new location is also great. The light fixture over the big bar table in the center of the room is made of liquor bottles and has lightbulbs where you can see the filament. They have an amazing selection of hamburgers from grass fed beef to lamb to portobello mushroom. They also have two fabulous soups, cream of mushroom loaded with chunky mushrooms and a fresh made tomato soup. On this particular occasion I had the bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. The hamburger is cooked over an open flame and you can really taste it. The beef is also extraordinarily fresh and flavorful.  The bacon was thick sliced and cooked perfectly.  The sandwich was juicy and delicious.  The sweet potato fries did not disappoint! They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and kissed with coarse salt that only added to their flavor. My friend Kris had a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and tomato and a cup of the tomato soup. The sandwich was made on thick slices of bread and cut into 4ths, just right for dunking in the soup. Kris said it was delicious."}, {"review_id": "YTkG4Dh7cMVqXREUpneCQw", "user_id": "HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "I'm told they've had an overhaul of the menu, and it's no longer primarily a burger place. I met a few locals who asked where I had eaten, and they were surprised to hear it wasn't just about the burgers, so it's definitely a new development.Take a peek at the menu. I added a pic, but I'm also told it will probably change a bit, so look but don't fall in love. It will give you an idea, however, of what they're reaching for. A little more New American, a little more elevated, but with roots in the classics.Take the \"It Girl\" of restaurant menus of 2017: cauliflower. It's on trend, and their version was every bit as delicious as you'd hope. Fried, simple, but really flavorful. I also tried the Jar-B-Que a sort of marriage between pulled pork and paté, served in a jar with points and pickled grapes. Pickled grapes are one of my new favorite things. The standout lunch app, though, was the heirloom tomato dish, with citrus, and a little bit of habañero spice. Quality ingredients in, equal quality flavors out. For all my talk of it going away from a burger joint, I ended up getting the lamb burger for lunch. The subtle lamb flavor didn't overpower the burger, and in fact played well in the barnyard with goat cheese. The pickled fennel had a nice taste, but texturally, it was a bit fibrous and the only misstep of the day. I love fennel, I love all pickled things, but it didn't really dovetail into the whole burger. These guys are really aiming for my tastebuds. So many things went unordered: I love beets, I love egg salad, I love grilled cheese--all of these have a role in the current menu. And for a sit down lunch in a modern space with exposed trusses and industrial lighting, you can get most stuff for $10-12, or $14 for a burger (steak salad tops out at $20). That's getting pretty close to everyday prices, but you can for sure afford to come in at least once a week."}, {"review_id": "p2daAoJT3ke-kUyXX3w21g", "user_id": "CqQuA6sT1_CmNJWR3qkzeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "This place is great for dinner or just drinks.

Last time I visited, it was still over on the Main Street. The new space is bigger for sure and yet that didn't stop the owners from making their new location just as eclectic, fun and cool as the first!Bottles hang on the lights and your drinks come in mason jars...what more could you ask for in fun decorations!?This time around, we met up with a good old friend for lunch. When we were sat, our friend asked the waitress if the music could be turned down a bit so we could talk, to which she obliged and right away turned it down a bit. Our waitress was very sweet and I really wish I had caught her name! We ordered Brussel sprouts to start, which has a caesar drizzle, bread crumbs, and parmesan. I ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger with Fries, our friend ordered the BLTA, and Mike ordered the special, a cup of tomato soup and a Grilled Cheese.The Brussel sprouts were so soo good! Cheesy and golden and cooked perfectly. The grilled cheese had four different kinds of cheese and was ooey gooey and delicious. The BLTA had Chipotle aioli which my friend said added something special to a simple sandwich. But the best thing was that burger! A huge 1/2 lb beef patty, white cheddar, bacon, barbeque sauce, and crispy onions on a toasted bun. The Smokey bacon and bbq sauce with the melty white cheddar and the richness of the crispy onions and burger patty, which was cooked to perfection with just a bit of pink, made for the perfect combo! I ate the whole thing!!! So why the four stars? Honestly while I do love bacon burgers, the only other two options were a regular burger and a spicy one. Not only do I miss the Bison burger, it leaves much to desire in the options department. And IMO a restaurant as awesome as Midtown Eats should have some pretty creative options available at their finger tips! If the lunch and menu had a few more unique entrees and burgers, I think it would be even better!"}, {"review_id": "GZBMsWU9CDkAvMd1p_7apg", "user_id": "8Cnt6VrAmcyVG6q5AvMnjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Unique trendy food which was a much needed add to the Reno scene.

There was one large/full high top table and two smaller tables with a couple people apiece. I was immediately acknowledged and asked where I'd like to sit and I chose the bar.This place was an immediate favorite based on atmosphere. It was a little loud even around open on a Sunday with the large party but despite that I really liked it. Very clean cut but industrial, modern-looking. Lots of sunlight coming in. This place will also look pretty sweet at night with the interesting light fixtures. I give it a 4/5 on the hipster scale that I just made up. Bathrooms were also clean and large, single occupancy.  I had never had a bellini before but I ordered the orange vanilla. The bartender/waitress made it (how I assume it is usually made) with a small amount of pre-made orange colored syrup/puree and filled the glass with sparkling wine. It was good, not too sweet and had a light orange flavor and what tasted like real/fresh vanilla.When I sat down at the bar they put down a napkin for me like a place mat, facing me like a diamond, and placed a water decanter and glass on that. Then they put down a paper napkin and crossed the fork and knife in the same fashion as their sign and I loved it. To eat I ordered the lamb burger. Again as I state in most of my reviews, I'm no professional. I AM picky about lamb burgers and I feel like they either suck, are really good, or are not appreciated. What I also know is that most lamb burgers usually have tzaziki and feta and too much of one or both. The description also said it came with olive tapenade which freaked me out because olives roll on a fine line for me. Usually I don't like them, even \"good\" ones, and the thought of an olive paste made me wince. But I decided to trust the chef and try it. I was not disappointed.I thought the flavors together were magnificent. They blended well and while I could easily discern the tang of olives from the rest of the toppings, I actually liked it quite a bit. I kept waiting for everything on it to be too much. Tzaziki, salty olives and salty feta? But I think it was just right. The oven-cured tomatoes helped balance it out. $14 for the burger and regular fries.I got sweet potato fries for a $1 upgrade. The plate came out with a delicious zesty aioli type savory sauce, probably chipotle mayo. Anyhow it looked zesty and tasted amazing even on the sweet fries. The fries were crispy with soft centers, and cut the way I love sweet potato fries to be cut: thin but wide, if that makes any sense. (Look at the pictures.) I'll definitely be back here for the atmosphere and to try other foods from the menu."}, {"review_id": "TcmL-ebvL10ROTCMzAED_w", "user_id": "QidUTm6w9SLuBGKKZ7BSAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2017", "text": "First time coming to the new location!  The decor is nice and the restaurant is spacious.  Service was quick and pleasant.  We ordered the bison burger with sweet potato fries and the elk burger with regular fries.  There was a bit of a wait but once the food was out it was totally worth it.  I had the bison burger medium, it was very juicy and well cooked.  The flavors of the BBQ sauce, white cheddar, and onion ring all go together well. Be sure to upgrade to the sweet potato fries! They're my favorite in Reno! We ended the meal with a lavender creme brulee, so tasty!!  I'm usually not a fan of floral flavors in desserts but the creme brulee had a good balance.  Glad I made a visit for lunch.
