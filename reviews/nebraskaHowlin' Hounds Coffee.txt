It's a no-frills joint, no PSL's in sight (thank God). I had a mocha (bit of an antithesis after just dissing pumpkin spice, I know), and I have to say that it was one of the best coffees I've had anywhere. In Omaha of all places. Mind blown. Super smooth with the right balance of bittersweet chocolate.The real gem is Greg, and watching his interactions with the regulars was great. He was a gracious \"host,\" getting to know a little about me and including me in the conversations happening. I enjoyed the intelligence and humor, it felt like hanging with old friends. Now if he'd just set up shop in Greenville instead..."}, {"review_id": "TmX1nKYsr19N64mFCKi4Tw", "user_id": "z8MFcNR7-bnRLj55pwQ45g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "An easy 5 stars and 2 high fives! We were in town visiting family and trusted our fellow yelpers to find a good coffee. Greg did not disappoint with his absolutley perfect balance of friendly personal service with efficiency. We came back and will be back whenever we are in Omaha. PS. If you are thinking, but it's next to the correctional facility and that scares me, STOP,  think about it, bad guys want to stay far away from this place and there's plenty of cops around too.  Come and enjoy a great coffee and check out the reading area too."}, {"review_id": "jZ4fz6cbPgvj_cqCWaUIaQ", "user_id": "59w9POQo-v1t-1EOXi5IpQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Best coffee in town, this has the perfect ambiance.

At $4.00 per cup, I'd usually bitch it was overpriced; but not here. This coffee was worth every single cent.

I would not come here to look for a super sugary frappa-anything, but if you enjoy a good strong coffee, this is a great place. It reminds me a lot of the boutique coffee shops out of Chicago (like Bow Truss...even though it is not really boutique anymore). The atmosphere is very nice, friendly, and peaceful. This would be a great place to study, relax and read, or go on a coffee guy. When we visited, there was a floofy doggo inside, which I thought was very cool (+10 for dog friendly).My only critique is that I thought there would be some more breakfast goods. The Facebook page made it looked like there would be a few more substantial food items, and we came to eat breakfast there. However we quickly realized it was a true coffee shop. So we went to Kitchen Table for breakfast.I definitely hope good things for this place. It is such a refreshing place in a sea of Starbucks and a wonderful atmosphere!"}, {"review_id": "P8CfSKk9bLNfVmI2wymZXA", "user_id": "9Do0oHQlOFMJWITrknU_Ow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "This place is outstanding!!

The owner (Greg) is very down to earth and knows pretty much everything there is to know about coffee. And this place isn't like those yuppy coffee shops you see downtown where you get a tiny cup of Joe for $6.00, this is Big-League coffee. No more 8oz cups of sour subpar brew served by a stuck up barista that scoffs at you for ordering anything other than an americano. You come craving caffeine and you will get it, at a fraction of the cost! You can order pretty much any type of coffee/tea drink here even if it isn't on the actual menu, just ask and you shall receive. I come almost every single week and I would recommend everyone do the same. My only bit of advice is that he should be open later during the weekend because I want coffee after I have a nice dinner in the Old Market.Try the French Press!"}, {"review_id": "k4MdCewstB62CmtB8hy2Tg", "user_id": "nZH8ltiqZ77SYrpie6tkYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Visiting from good ole North Dakota.

There's also yoga on Sunday's at 8:00am.  It's good for individuals and groups.
