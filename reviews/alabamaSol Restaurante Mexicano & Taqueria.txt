The atmosphere is really cool. This is one of the few places in the area that serves street tacos and CHURROS . The chicken soup is even delicious. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's so good it's typically crowded and I haven't been there in a while where there wasn't a wait."}, {"review_id": "4_f-C66T1F3ouitpgeRr_Q", "user_id": "QAvWNCSinAeQntylR6aRpA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "I came to this establishment based on the reviews of other yelpers, and overall it was an excellent experience. The staff was polite and very fast. I was given chips and salsa before my butt was firmly in its seat. The decor is a refreshing change from most Mexican restaurants, in that it is not orange, green, and overly bright. Instead, it looks like a trendy bar, with woods, brick walls, and chic lighting. Now to the part you care about. The food. The salsa was very good, and tasted house made. The chips were hot, and I received a large portion. I ordered the Carne Asada, one of my favorites. It arrived quickly with a generous side of rice and beans, which were very good. The steak itself is a bit of a problem. On one hand it was perfectly cooked, a hard thing with flank steak. On the other it was on the bland side. I noticed the waitress had given me a cup with a whole fire roasted jalapeño and two whole fire roasted green onions. I cut these up with my steak knife, and poured the salsa over the entree. OMG. It was absolutely amazing. However, I dont feel like I should have to do knife work at my table to make my entree acceptable. Overall, a very good meal and a place I would come back to."}, {"review_id": "NfXS-A7CZKc4U-eoJVFZkg", "user_id": "xSCnlBVeyPOVBAm9i-f3BQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "This was my first time going to this place.

The food was light and not heavy on the stomach.  I was looking for something different to try and enjoy.  I will be coming back again to try out their other dishes.

It was a great little lunch spot on our way through town and I was really impressed. We had good service and I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. We got a ton of food for only $15 bucks! I had the chicken fajitas and it came with a ton of food! Lots of chicken, peppers, rice, beans, and guacamole! Less than 10 and more than I could eat. My husband got a combo plate with a burrito, fluata, and tamale. Out of everything the fajitas and the burrito were the winners. I will definitely come back for cheap eats in the future."}, {"review_id": "cEpSd8EmJ5yQcxbYzlQeZw", "user_id": "AmMZnfVaYtfLDz9uXJqq2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "The food was amazing and service was super fast. When you first get there, they bring you chips and salsa, and take a drink order. Then, you order your food--I got the fajitas! I've never had them served in a cauldron/lava stone but it was amazing. I got the mixed shrimp/steak/chicken; absolutely phenomenal especially for someone one on a ketogenic diet. My wife got the steak and grilled veggies over rice.. all covered with cheese. Again, super tasty! If you are looking for an authentic, tasty, quick, and reasonable pricing, try this place!

After, we went to two other restaurants before we found Sol; one wanted a cover fee of $20/person even the kids and the other said they were closing even though their stated hours said they closed later. I'm so glad the first two restaurants didn't work out! Every single one of us are ecstatic we found this gem of a restaurant. We were so pleased by our first visit, my sister wanted to meet here again for her birthday dinner and I made a point to come here again on my way to Biloxi. So so far we've eaten here 3 time in the past month and every time we've been greeted with friendly smiles, had excellent service, and the food was amazing. Even with our bigger parties the food was made in a timely manner with their kitchen being busy. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great service, a friendly atmosphere, and delicious food."}, {"review_id": "ya1DmxrRcmfFBN0_BWlg1Q", "user_id": "7bEWhfezb_T6mG1BIqy84A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "My family and I have eaten here several times, however we usually get it to go.
