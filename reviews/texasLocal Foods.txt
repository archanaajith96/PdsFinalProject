If you can't think of any other restaurants to grab lunch at, this is THE place. Not only is the food presentation exceptional but the food tastes perfect in every way imaginable. I'm not exaggerating! And it's healthy too. The BLT and roast beef sandwiches are filling and great choices for lunch. For dinner I suggest the braised shortrib with mashed potatoes and spinach. As a side note they have in-house non-alcoholic drinks, but they're pretty much hit or miss. Pair this with a nice ambience and you have this lovely little cafe.In the afternoon it's packed though, so be prepared to wait in line. Try getting a seat at the bar. It is popular for a reason!"}, {"review_id": "WdHuFUIA6maE5Mp0Qq53Zg", "user_id": "a4--U7tTJmJzua8JJibtNw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon, and boy was the line long. We debated on whether or not to leave, but ended up staying because the line actually started moving pretty quickly. If you're looking for a place to sit all by yourself, good luck snagging one of those booths or tables because you'll probably end up sharing like we did.Service was quick and friendly and we got our orders within the 10 minutes that we sat down. My boyfriend ordered the GULF SEAFOOD, which consisted of gulf shrimp, crab, green goddess (not too sure what that is), romaine lettuce, pickled red onion slices, and tomato slices encased in a toasted ciabatta bun, and the side of HOUSEMADE CHIPS and QUINOA. I took a bite out of his sandwich (when offered) and it was very delicious and tasted very fresh and flavorful. I ordered the VEGAN \"MEAT\"BALL sandwich made of mushroom-pecan \"meat\" balls, spicy giardinera, tomato marinara, and arugula pesto topped with a toasted baguette, and a side of VEGAN GUMBO. The mushroom-pecan \"meat\" balls were not as flavorful, and the arugula pesto was overshadowed by the tomato marinara. However, I found the vegan gumbo to be delicious, and the meal itself a success. Great food, great experience, will be back again."}, {"review_id": "_Wlx6FxIUOZx5sOEqLcF8A", "user_id": "XqkhhnE_Cjz5UR79U3TS8Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I am a huge fan of Local Foods but OH MY GOD ... the people working here have some of the worst attitudes that I have ever dealt with in the service industry. I came here a few days ago for dinner with a couple of friends. Food was excellent. I had ordered the catch of the day which was grilled snapper over a bed of creamy garlicky potatoes with some veggies sprouting out if. Picture perfect, delectable goodness. Couldn't stop ranting and raving about the green pea chutney like sauce that accompanied it.However, when I was placing the order, the cashier was talking to me like I had two heads. Upon delivery of the food to our table (there were three of us with three different numbers), the same girl continued to deliver the food. First time she came by, she put the food down and left. The second time she came over, it looked like she was really in a rush like had left all her stoves on at home and was worried that her doggo would pull a Plath. Lastly, she comes over to bring my food and literally SLAMS it on the table. Like, I am not the one for dramatics and I am surely not a snooty mcdoucher when it comes to service but don't throw my food at the table and roll your eyes when leaving. Like, I am not sure what I did to deserve such type of a disservice. I really hope she gets some medical attention soon."}, {"review_id": "Y0FJJDGMl6ZJZVeNDkh9bg", "user_id": "3RTesI_MAwct13LWm4rhLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "My sisters rave about this place and decided to take me to see for myself. This place was poppin on a Saturday afternoon but seating was plentiful so it wasn't hard to find a table. We shared the crab cakes and the fish tacos. Both plates were great with a nice balance of flavors. Only complaint would be the crab cakes; it should have a contrast of texture from the soft eggs and the soft asparagus. This place is great for brunch with the girls or an outing with your dog!"}, {"review_id": "h6Wtw5ySpiJo_mu0uHP80A", "user_id": "oAij0wBNMueKVUcDv3qLdg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "My 2nd time back here and I always have a good time here. The food, aesthetic, and service is always on point! It's one of those places where a seat anywhere is a good seat. I really recommend sitting in the outdoor area under the fairy lights when the weather is good though! How it works: you pretty much walk in and there's menus in a bucket ready for your eyes 0.0 The menu options are pretty much the same as other locations so I've heard, with differences being in the sides and some other specials? However, my go to is the Crunchy Chicken because I never say no to chicken LOL. You wait for an open register and you hop on over to place your order and they'll give you a number so you can pick any table you like and they'll bring the food out to you. Food: I ordered the Crunchy Chicken sandwich with sides of kale and quinoa. The chicken was really delicious and all white meat. It was really refreshing with the tomatoes and veggies in the bun. If you needed a lean option to fill up on, I really recommend. The sides were simple yet memorable. Tip: if you need a to-go box, it's a self service kind of deal where they put the boxes/cups in the wooden cabinet by the drinks area so don't be shy and open up that cabinet door to grab your supplies.

I've been to several of the locations, but the Upper Kirby location most often. Every food item I've seen from LF looks delicious, but I can't seem to tear myself away from getting my favorite -- the Seasonal Harvest Salad ($11). Usually I had tofu (+$2), but I've also had it without an added protein and it's still hearty enough to fill me up. I love that it's always changing, but the base stays the same and it's always delicious. Also enjoy their rotating side items -- especially the seasonal fruit!

It is absolutely, positively worth all the hype. The setup is cafeteria style where you order at the counter, take a number and your meal is brought to you. I've had the posole both times and it is phenomenal. Love the pepitas and opted for a side of bread. For lunch we split the chicken sandwich (swapped the pretzel bun for sliced bread) and burger and am so glad to have done that so I had a chance to try both! For dinner, I got the shrimp and greens which doesn't seem like it would knock one's socks off, but those had to have been the best greens I've ever had and the skewered shrimp were nothing short of amazing. I tried my bf's chicken (which seemed like an entire bird) and it was extremely juicy and flavorful. Always a fan of a beautiful bar that boasts a nice selection of local brews.

I've been avoiding to eat at Local Foods because of past experiences. My boyfriend really likes Local Foods, so I decided to give it another shot. Came here for lunch the other day with my boyfriend and my dog (Ares). Parking was not an issue since there were quite a lot of places to park. We walked in from the patio. The patio was clean and well maintained. The tables and chairs were clean and there was no trash on the floor. I had my dog with me so I couldn't enter the restaurant. My boyfriend brought out menus so we took a look and chose what to order. The prices were kind of high, in my opinion. I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich with a side of vegan bean and rice soup, and honey iced coffee. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken sandwich with a side of soup (forgot which one). I sat down waited for my boyfriend to finish ordering food. He brought out water for him and Ares. We waited for about 15 minutes for our food to come out. So the wait time wasn't that long (which was great). My sandwich was delicious! I never thought I'd like it. The BBQ pork was more like deli meat, I was thinking of pulled pork. Not a bad thing, I was just expecting something else. The soup was on point, not too bland and not too salty. My drink was also great, not extremely sweetened. Overall, I will come back to eat again. It wasn't as bad as I thought!"}, {"review_id": "6KNJe7fn3T8huHMIlRYPzA", "user_id": "EFREZjXOkhjeQcatp2jX3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "Great lunch spot for a sandwich or salad, a visit to Local Foods is always guaranteed happiness.  Healthy, fresh, and locally sourced ingredients?  Yes please!
