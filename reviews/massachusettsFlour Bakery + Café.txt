It was a busy morning for everybody in the cafe and there was no empty table inside or outside the place. Nevertheless, it was worth the wait and worth standing outside in the cold for the food.I ordered their chopped Greek salad and their spiced chai latte. I was happy with my order as it was a light breakfast for my long travel. I liked the salad so much, I took a picture of the ingredients and will have to try to make it myself. The spiced chai made so happy; it wasn't too sweet and it was extremely hot, the exact temperature to match the cold air in Massachusetts. Definitely going to come back again (:"}, {"review_id": "mMVNJNos1BH31ejDuNE3Tg", "user_id": "zUKeZNu4tCG56xjwWH54Vw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I was in Boston for a business meeting, I was saving my lunch for one of the famous sticky buns I've been reading about and seeing on social media.I'm from New York. We have a few rings from our baseball team. We also have crowd control when it comes to in demand items like Cronuts. (I've waited multiple times on line at Dominique Ansel Bakery, the Cronut is king) Walking into Flour Bakery + Café, its total madness. There are people everywhere, there are no lines, no signs and more importantly, no Sticky Buns. It's noon and I ask the counter person, I don't see any Sticky Buns, do you have any in the back? Nope, we ran out earlier today. What??? The counter person noticed I was bummed so he directed me to the bread pudding with the sticky bun topping. Alright.. It's the David Wells curse, I get it..........The bread pudding was pretty good. I had it later that day with coffee. What would have been awesome was a sticky bun!Boston, I'll be back."}, {"review_id": "D-UjMwS2-KGZz9raWECFKw", "user_id": "tNq35k92WAkSLSqeof03hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "It is a popular bakery for its pastries and sandwiches. It is specifically known for its sticky buns. The pecans and sauce on top of the bun were incredible and gave the \"Wow\" factor. The brioche bun was also delicious. They were like donuts. I was also at the bakery near the end of the day when they only had a sticky bun bread pudding. The pudding was good but it is not for everyone. Since it is pudding, it can get a little soggy at the end of the day. As such, it is why the regular sticky bun, with the brioche bread, is the top seller. Nevertheless, the bread pudding version still has the caramelized pecans on top, which is the best part of the sticky buns.If you are visiting and planning a trip to Boston and looking for recommendations (especially food), feel free to message me for my itinerary.

Came in on a Tuesday morning at 8:30 to something that can only be described as organized chaos. The woman that took my order was very nice and efficient, but had to pass me off to someone else since I wanted to pay in cash. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with bacon. Not sure I've ever had an egg sandwich with Arugula on it, but when combined with some secret sauce, it was incredible. Wife had the french toast, which was fine, and daughter had some crazy roasted cauliflower sandwich with a magical jam.

They make unique breakfast items such as an egg sandwich (the egg is like a quiche) with arugula, bacon and a dijon dressing.  Delicious!  I also had an open face BLT made with two poached eggs.  Nice!  I also tried their croissant with jam and a brioche thing. Both were excellent! Coffee was good too.This place is bustling and seating is a little undersized so you have to \"observe, hover and swarm \" to get seated.  Having more than one person helps. :)"}, {"review_id": "LKd7O-ilQ_ExbleGx58hJA", "user_id": "yFhiVAcHAFvVV-8MqtgINQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Stopped by on an early weekday morning - still with a line, but nothing approaching the crazy sandwich lunch line. My friend and I split three pastries: the almond brioche, a sticky bun, and a scone. The sticky bun was solid as always. I hesitate to say this in case it gets sold out but the double baked brioche is the unsung hero of Flour - it's delicate, but doesn't fall apart.

Immensely popular, I made an effort to come just when they had opened (6:30 a.m) to beat the crowd. Hidden at Fort Point  neighborhood, this cozy spot may not be fancy in any way, just peaceful and homey comes to mind. To warm up my belly, I had their mate latte, which is a green-tea based latte. Unfortunately, this tasted bland and disappointing. For breakfast, I had their egg sandwich and this will happily engage in all of your senses; it had a savory note from the egg and bacon, sourness from the sourdough buns and the bitterness from the arugula - overall, it was a dream!Can't go to Flour Bakery + Cafe without trying their famous creation, the Sticky Buns. On my first bite, I must say, it was not as I expected. The sticky bun was a bit dry and it feels like it's freshly made, but been sitting a while that it loses its soft texture and gooeyness. So glad I didn't get a dozen of these home! Even though I didn't leave this place sugar-high, there were still some sweet moments with Flour Bakery+Cafe. The staffs were incredible and full of smiles. The choices of desserts/ pastries here will definitely get your appetite running. On top of that, the egg sandwich was actually good enough to make me wanna come back :)."}, {"review_id": "ap3BxV-9LGvUVGRB0u2L0Q", "user_id": "oID4QGAu8v1mQfKOSEt_Bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Their avocado toast is one of the best I've ever tasted!!!

I am a cookie fiend, and my go-to is ALWAYS the Lola: a mixture of oatmeal, chocolate, coconut, and pecans. Do note that it's heavily laden with chocolate, and the coconut and pecans are a bit lacking. Overall though, it's a fun cookie with a good amount of variety and textures going on to keep your tastebuds entertained! I love that it has crispy edges but a super soft center. Just my type of cookie! I recently ordered the Grilled Chicken sandwich because I saw on the menu that it had Brie in it! But was sorely disappointed to find the thinnest slicest of Brie. Overall, the sandwich was good and generous in size. But seriously! GIMME MORE BRIE!! Definitely will be back for the baked goods.

I have always loved their sandwiches but never had much of a sweet tooth. However I am always impressed with all their baked goods as well as their coffees. For sandwiches, all the roast chicken is one of my all time favorites with mashed avocado and julienned jicama (a mild root vegetable) that offers a refreshing crunch to the sandwich. Today I tried their roast lamb which had fresh cucumbers and shaved fennel. The lamb had a nice gamey taste and the other components worked so well with to create a satisfying bite every time. Prices are around the same with what you'd expect to spend on lunch in the area with sandwiches usually coming out to around $10. If you really want to splurge for breakfast they also have a killer breakfast sandwich with an egg soufflé that is super fluffy and silky smooth paired with arugula, horseradish mayo, and bacon. Definitely a keeper and really glad to have such a nice spot around the area."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/flour-bakery-caf%C3%A9-boston-4?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
