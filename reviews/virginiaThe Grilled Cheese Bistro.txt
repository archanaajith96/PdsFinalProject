And I have to say I had a great time. I got one of the last two seats at the bar, and this was on a Wednesday at 1:30! I ordered an Arnold Palmer, and this is different than any other Arnold Palmer I've ever had. It's pink in color with hibiscus tea, lemon San Pellegrino and half a dozen blueberries. My first sip was a little weird, as it had a touch of sour on it, but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.I ordered the Meathead sandwich with thinly sliced sliced turkey breast, Applewood bacon, avocado, fresh cut fries, mustard and white cheddar. Obviously, it was filling with those fries! All I needed was vinegar slaw on top and I would have been in Pittsburgh! The turkey was great quality and the bacon was quite crispy, but not overdone. I barely tasted the mustard. The one thing I would do different is add some sliced tomato to help cut through the heaviness of the salty fries, and the crispy bread.The guys next to me ordered several plates of fries and there was no way they were going to finish them off. They let me have a couple of the fries tossed in Applewood smoked sea salt. These were unbelievably good. That smoke flavor had me coming back for more and more. The mountain of Parmesan chimichurri fries looked out of this world. I was thinking where's an Argentine steak when you need one?! Needing a palate cleanser, I asked for a some pickles, and they gave me a plat with two enormous spears. They definitely hit the spot.It's tough to get a spot here, but it's well worth it once you can get it."}, {"review_id": "0a49eofBGs8IS15uENGdTQ", "user_id": "Lm8MbqgIrPsE0isG8HteCQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Love the open atmosphere and open seating very good food but a bit over priced, Dreaming of Reuben is a very hardy sandwich The tomato bisque is creamy with a sweet basil taste The teas are amazing  I would give five stars but the prices dropped it down to four all n all great place for a date night or a quick bite to eat before heading out in town"}, {"review_id": "6113nAZ5oGKwF0J-k5-FIA", "user_id": "pbYreHzugH0qnsWm0vTl0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "This place was really good.

This is a great problem to have for a restaurant. They have a bar and a few spots around tables and another bar set up in front of the window on the main road. It was quiet enough for conversation without music which was great! Food: The sandwiches are awesome! I think I could have eaten every item on the menu as they all sounded amazing!  Service: Even more awesome! Our server truly believed in the quality and taste of the food here. She was super nice and very informative. One of the coolest spots I have eaten at. I highly recommend this place.

We've been back countless times since!  It's a tight space but we both enjoyed the cozy vibe along with the food/beverage (draft root beer, Arnold palmer, moscato, craft beer) offerings.The staff are always friendly and helpful, advising on what creations they enjoy most.  First visit, we indulged on 2 sandwiches (special changes daily) and an order of Parmesan chimichurri fries. THOSE FRIES & SAUCE are a staple of every visit.  As GCB veterans, my wife and I have tried every sandwich on the menu. Most are bursting with wonderful flavor combinations - from savory/sweet to sweet/heat.  The hangover with pulled pork is my favorite while she likes the Johnny Appleseed!  Tip: two people can split a sandwich and an order of fries easily.  If you save room, the delight dessert is pretty tasty too - coffee gelato, chocolate cookie, bacon, fig marmalade!Checkout is done via iPad to reduce wait time before exiting.While Downtown Norfolk can be busy, expect the need to walk a few blocks from wherever you find available/safe parking.  Also, since appearing on Food TV, the wait times have increased slightly.  Don't let either stop you from going.  Your taste buds deserve this comfort food with flare!"}, {"review_id": "44GPwzB_FvcEgZ999CE1yw", "user_id": "WDeXGl-1ERMdr1ThjCgGjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I've been here one too many times since I discovered it and each time is as good as day one.

Growing up I absolutely was addicted to cheese, my mother would always joke that I was just going to turn into a mozzarella stick if I kept up my habits! (Spoiler alert I turned out ok) But back to the cheese....The Bistro has THE CHEESE! I mean ever had a Grilled Cheese, Macaroni and Cheese sandwich!?!? Absolutely incredible and delicious! And to top it off they have amazing fries with different sauces to dip it in! The atmosphere in the restaurant is very quaint and not as well lit as I would of liked, and they have a different selection of spirits for those of you wanting to be a little tipsy with your cheese! The one star I knocked off was because sadly this Bistro is not big enough for the amount of people that want to go! Which means you need to get there early or you may ind yourself in line waiting!

You get a lot for a reasonable price. This was the best grilled cheese I have had. I ordered fries with my sandwich. I do not recommend this unless you are sharing it with 1-2 other people. The sandwich was more than enough food for one person. The place is small and can feel crowded but the food made up for this. I also tried the Hibiscus tea. It was different and refreshing.

I ordered the special from the board since I couldn't get that anytime I wanted. The place is small but managed the space very well to get people in and not over crowd. They have some really good tea options for drinks. I chose to get the Hibiscus lightly sweetened and it was very refreshing. I watched many items come from the kitchen from my seat and every single thing looked amazing! My sandwich came out very quick even though it was a full house inside. It was hot, smelled like heaven, and the cheese was all melted holding all of the extras into place. I recommend if you like sweet and savory all in one bite. I only could finish half the sandwich but made sure to enjoy the other half shortly after getting home."}, {"review_id": "i1USwt341J_mBFHOFBdHMA", "user_id": "D05jzLKZanNPQ-OJknvQAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "If you're still a kid at heart, this is the place for you! We arrived here on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed- be prepared to wait since the restaurant itself is small (only a few tables plus bar/window seating). Obviously, I had been waiting to try their amazing grilled cheese sandwiches and I was not surprised by the amount of choices they had; the restaurant was super vegetarian friendly. In the end, my friends and I went for the Don Quixote, the Giuseppe (no prosciutto), and the Hangover along with some Parmesan Chimichurri Fries. My, my, my! It was so worth it! If we had to rank the three cheesy bites of heaven we would say (1) Hangover- absolutely must get; best truffle Mac ever! (2) Don Quixote- great combination of flavors (3) Giuseppe- if you like unique sandwich combos and have a sweet tooth. The fries were honestly just as good as the meal and we left feeling completely stuffed.

Customer service is absolutely stellar. Whatever grilled cheese sandwich you get will be a totally rich treat. I love the root beer float with coffee ice cream. ***Saturday dinner opens at 6pm. We parked around the corner and walked by around 5:55pm. I was surprised to see the line wrapped around the building. I did not expect that! They were able to seat everyone ahead of us really quickly. But they eventually did run out of tables. We had 4 couples in front of us and those 4, plus us had a wait of 45 minutes. So if you don't want to wait, arrive way before 5:55pm or after 7:30pm. When we left at 7:30pm, I noticed there wasn't a line out the door anymore. The hostess was right on the money about the wait. She had told us 45-60 minutes. We got seated at 6:45pm. Hostess: They would not be able to get away with that wait if it weren't for the hostess. She's so great. Very nice - automatically offers paper menus to look over while you're waiting, offers waters, answers people's dumb questions. What a saint. When people pay their check and leave, she's really quick to help clean so new people can be sat ASAP. Once we got seated, our waitress came by. We already knew what we wanted so we immediately ordered: root beer float, fries with parm and chimichurri sauce, Reuben for me, Meathead for him. Root beer float: On the menu, they offer their root beer float with coffee ice cream. That's a new one! It was soooo good. I'm going to get all my future floats with coffee ice cream!Fries: 3 people can easily share 1 order of fries. They were good fries. I don't know if they're special or life-changing, but they're good. They're very generous with the toppings. They didn't skimp on the parm or chimichurri.Reuben: I got the reuben. It was life-changing good. Reuben is my fav sandwich but I probably haven't had one in at least 2+ years cause they're just so rich. They have an awesome reuben here. My 1st two bites of each edge didn't have enough or any sauerkraut, so that was kind of confusing. I asked for a side cup of sauerkraut and that helped. Going forward, every bite was pure perfection. Their cuts of meat and slices of gooey cheese are so generous. My fingers were wet from buttered bread. This sandwich is definitely a rich treat. I was able to almost finish half and took home the other half. They don't have a paper receipt system here. Instead, they have a small tablet they give to you. I think that part is kind of socially awkward cause they're standing and waiting while you calculate a tip. Maybe they could drop it off, pretend to check on a nearby table, and come back? I don't know.Until next time: I had a good time. I would love to come back for the El Cubano, caprese, Don Quixote (this one is an award winning sandwich - Best Grilled Cheese in Virginia). The sandwiches are sooooo decadent though. I'll prob need to space out my visits over 6 years!"}, {"review_id": "bPJiTsHWzohTLvYcNOCFZg", "user_id": "s9ShhbzhnwFDIi3iOMQSnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "My wife and I have been looking for an opportunity to try Grilled Cheese Bistro, as nearly every review we had read was very positive. The first time we went (at lunchtime), the place was jam-packed, with a wait of over half an hour. With two little girls in tow, that wasn't going to happen, so we tried a place down the street. Today, we decided to do a lunch date, just the two of us. When we arrived, the place was fully packed. No one on staff was acknowledging anyone who came in. After about five minutes, my wife finally went up to one of the servers, who rather curtly said, \"How many?\" There was no greeting, just the impression that we were inconveniencing them by filling their restaurant with customers. They even mixed up the order for seating the waiting customers, and it was only the honesty of those customers that made sure the first people were seated first.Once we were finally seated, the service was much better. The grilled cheese sandwiches (my wife had \"The Big O\", which was almost a dessert sandwich, and I had the \"Don Quixote\", which is a savory blend of cheeses, grilled onions, mushrooms, olives, and red peppers) were prepared to perfection. The fries, which we ordered with their cinnamon cayenne topping, were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and served piping hot with a chipotle aioli sauce. Grilled Cheese Bistro is a fun place to eat with delicious food that is locally sourced. They do need to get a handle on how they deal with large crowds. Aside from that issue, this place would get a five-out-of-five rating from me."}, {"review_id": "U7CZVd4ndgVppKbcmOWJuw", "user_id": "dy2dCDIUImTMsj7aRugAFQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Finally trying this place out and it was tasty.

Every time my boyfriend and I passed by it, it would always be packed with a 20-30 minute wait and we would be hungry since yesterday. Well on our anniversary weekend, we decided to find out when they opened and be the first people there. Got there before 10am and stood by the entrance. Once they let us in, we sat at the bar area facing the line of cooks. I got too excited and asked for their special right away, not thinking that they just opened and she probably didn't have the info yet, because she didn't and I felt bad.  After a minute, she came back around with the special of the day: (Roast beef, caramelized onions, fries, Swiss and mozzarella, chimichurri aioli and jalapeños). My bf immediately wanted to order that because he heard jalapeños. I ordered the Dreamin of Rueben and fried pickles for the both of us. Sadly, I'm taking one star out because of the fried pickles. They were just, \"ok\" and I'm not a huge fan of the dipping sauce because I didn't really get the chipotle flavor, more mayo than anything. The sandwiches though, exceeded our expectations. We sampled each other's as well and no disappointments. The Reuben tasted just right even without the rye bread and I loved the chimichurri aioli that went with the sandwich of the day. I will definitely come here again and hopefully try the hangover next time."}, {"review_id": "cFq91v-dWhiPGKtGpMr-_g", "user_id": "82dCHyU-ANOgdhxUgZsUeg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "If you love cheese, then this is the place to be!Furthermore, if you like alcohol that's a plus since this place is pretty much a trendy bar as well.A grilled cheese sandwich is a classic comfort food--familiar to all people in America who have ever been hungry and opened their fridges/cabinets and saw processed cheese and bread.

I paid $6 for one hour of parking. There's literally no street parking during the day but the streets have meters so it seems you will have to pay for parking no matter what. I was lucky to even get a spot in the tiny parking lot next to the restaurant. There was a line outside the restaurant before it even opened at 6pm.
