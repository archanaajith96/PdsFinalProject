Drink selection was great - coffees, soda, cocktails.  My latte was delicious, and tempted to try the unusual flavor sodas but a little pricey at $3.50.  Tap water had noticeable chlorine taste - I think Dapper Pig would be wise to serve filtered water to its customers.  The homemade napkins were a nice touch, but the material was bedsheet-like, so the effort fell a little short.Modern jukebox looked like a lot of fun as both new and old music on it!  Two upstair rooms seating 4-6 each would add some privacy to a small group!!Nice neighborhood, very happy to see more restaurants in this area."}, {"review_id": "dIPI37RNAsCz5TPk7Kc-Gg", "user_id": "s4BMPW8VV-ELjDwV6zjWCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Eat here on Mondays!!!

Enjoyed a peaceful dinner on the patio!  The entryway is really tight, be careful coming in if it's busy. Overall has a quirky, artsy feel with lots of pig paraphernalia and delicious food!The cocktail list is long and interesting...I don't recall the name, but I had a drink with pisco. I don't often see pisco drinks that aren't a pisco sour. It was pretty and tasty. We got the wings for an appetizer; it's a pretty hefty serving. Maybe about 8 large wings. Good flavor, just a tad spicy for babies like me. For dinner, we ordered the ribs and a stuffed chicken dish, with sides of macaroni and cheese, the risotto, and mashed potatoes. The chicken dish was interesting and tasty, on a bed of some Brussels sprouts. The ribs were good, not amazing, but solid. The sides were all rich and very good. It was a delicious, hearty meal and I enjoyed leftovers the next day for lunch. Our meals were served on pretty slices of wood."}, {"review_id": "TCTu1hnQV4F_-uDMWcDCqQ", "user_id": "rEsJXd4FUFpsF_kHVJ185g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "Boy, am I a lucky duck! I happened to choose the Dapper Pig on my only night in Evansville, and Mondays are apparently a tasting menu of new things! Instead of the traditional menu, the chefs bring out four dishes they've created that day, and you get to pick one of those. Umm, AWESOME!The options tonight were a scallop burger (which is scallops arranged on a bun, so don't picture ground scallop patties) with some special sauces and freshly cut fries, a turkey meatball and quinoa sub and a side of house-made chips, a linguine with a jalapeno-base cream sauce, or macaroni and cheese with andouille sausage topped with seared steak and barbecue sauce. I really could have enjoyed any of those (except the scallops---I'm not partial to seafood. I had a feeling it would still be amazing, but I asked for it to be removed from the running) so I asked for a surprise! Living on the edge! I asked for a surprise cocktail, as well, and I was presented with a delicious Tom Collins, a drink I've always wanted to try. Score! And my surprise meal was----The mac and cheese! Woohoo!Now, I was nervous to have a mountain of macaroni and cheese topped with steak. It sounded really heavy, so I was prepared not to finish the dish when it arrived. But somehow the macaroni and cheese was really light. It was still delicious and creamy, but somehow it didn't have that heavy feeling that most macaroni and cheese has. The steak was sliced thin and was tender, and the drizzle of barbecue sauce really helped marry the sausage to the steak, which I was worried about. It also wasn't overly packed with sausage, which I think helped it stay light. While I can't guarantee you will ever have this dish at this restaurant (things are locally sourced and seasonal, as far as I know), I can guarantee that you will have an amazing meal here. Definitely a wonderful---and surprising!---dinner!"}, {"review_id": "z2U8qDjob9aV0EgItbZ9qA", "user_id": "qvtf-_JuZen1FYgVz7VHmg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "This was a very odd experience I went there on a Saturday and they were completely sold out of pork, chicken and beef. OK great business is good, thumbs up for that but I was starving and While everybody is chomping on ribs chicken and steak, here I am sitting at the bar starving to death with no solutions to my hunger problem. This to me is poor management from an inventory perspective, This should never happen at a restaurant and I have never experienced this. The lady at the bar was also a little rude and I guess it was because they were pretty busy. If upper management is reading this definitely go ahead and make sure that your stock is up to par, especially on the weekend."}, {"review_id": "XjsDOMSXKPbIDQqg9EtkPQ", "user_id": "hX2Mh4zQn17hjVyLrymCOA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "good but not reasonable, quite on the high end for food.

There were hardly any people in the restaurant for Valentine's Day.  The special menu looked exciting, but turned out to be an overpriced disappointment.  The soup was ok, the entree was horrible and the dessert....gross.  Looking around, everyone was leaving their desserts on the table mostly untouched. We soon found out why. They told us the pieces were so big, each couple only got 1 to share.  There were 3ppl at our table.  They brought us two pieces which combined were still smaller than 1 slice of a sams frozen cheesecake.....which we all ended up wishing it would have been.  The WORST cheesecake any of us ever had.  The chocolate \"cake\" looked awful too.  $40 each for this meal, excluding cocktails. No wonder it was dead in there and all the other restaurants were packed.

I took my boyfriend on a Saturday night in hopes of trying a B.L.A.T. but they only had a seasonal menu (I think the bartender said they sold out of meat early in the day?). I ordered crab cakes, which were almost room-temperature by the time they reached us. Other than that, the food was amazing- super fresh, made exceptionally well. Drinks were well made too. My boyfriend paid about $16 for two sides and a drink. Mine was around $34 for the crab cakes and a mixed drink. As a restaurant, I'd only recommend to people who don't care what they eat/have no dietary restrictions and are willing to spend a good chunk of money for fresh food (they didn't carry the same menu they had online in-store). I'd like to try it again during Sunday brunch to see what all the hype is about."}, {"review_id": "YMx7cJVHjzvKmG4pRTd2ww", "user_id": "7dNxR4jIr5MsDpbiQQGg-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/15/2017", "text": "What took me here was the ambience.

We sat at the bar and had great service despite they were busy. We had the fried green tomatoes with homemade ranch dip. Yummy, but a very big portion. I order the pork chop and had with fresh green beans. Excellent!! My husband had the steak, it had some unique smoked salt that you just have to try. Also Excellent. I highly recommend this place. If you love gin, they have an amazing gin selection. And if you don't love gin. You may now. It's not your typical nasty gin. Gotta try.  They have a great drink menu.

It was an old wood floor with many a layers of different colors of old deteriorated paint on it.The food was excellent!I ordered chicken soup because it was cold out.  I was expecting normal, nothing to write home about, good, homemade chicken soup.  It couldn't be farther from the truth.  This was the best chicken soup I ever ate!  The noodles were plentiful and properly cooked (still a little chew in them, and not over-cooked), the chicken had a nice solid texture, but still tender and soft, and a hint of smoke, and the stock was rich, and full of herbs and flavor, but still light.  I cannot stress enough, simply the best chicken soup I have ever had.The bacon cheeseburger was also excellent.  Medium-well patty as I had ordered it, arugula, cheese, and bacon.  The real star here though was the bread.  Perfect exterior color and texture, soft interior.  It stood up the the burger well, and didn't disintegrate as you ate it.  Simple perfection.  Kudos to the baker!The chocolate cake for dessert was good too.  The cake layers were a little dense and on the drier side of things.  But the chocolate layers were divine.  Perfect density, sweetness and flavor.  I was so full from the meal, but I could not stop eating the chocolate cake.  Granted it was a little pricey at $7... But it was worth it!Service was honest, friendly, and excellent!So impressed with this place.  Definitely got to hit this place again before I leave the city!"}, {"review_id": "lpsukHJGNJif4prqAh4fTA", "user_id": "c9Bl4Q8vkXh1VqyLRjNntg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "The Dapper Pig is one neat restaurant!! First of all, the first impression of the place is amazing. We sat upstairs and there are bicycles hanging from the ceiling!! Atmosphere is great. Second, I had searched the menu before arriving and it was difficult to find. This is because it changed depends on the season and what day of the week you come on. Still, the chefs decide nightly what they want to make so ask a lot of questions so you know what you are getting before you order. The waitress was very nice and bubbly. I ordered Wess' chicken and waffles because I saw that it was a favorite but when I saw what other people were getting, I wanted one of everything. EVERYTHING looked amazing. The food took a while to come out. There were two big table who got there right before us but I would plan on waiting for a little while. The food was amazing! And we also got crème brûlée to finish off the night. I recommend coming on a specialty night that you can find on Facebook. On Tuesday they have 99 cent wings and thursday is burger night.
