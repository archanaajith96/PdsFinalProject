No offense but I think our taste buds dwindle as we age and then you start getting the bland blanderson food which is what you will find here.  I feel like a real jerk but need to let y'all know. Everything tastes like the same texture like you could just blend it up and drink it eww. I'm from the south and like good old home cooking with flavors, textures, and deliciousness! Don't forget your spice belt lol  Ok seriously just go home and make it yourself.  Or get some General Mills hahaPs the staff was so nice though and made two of these stars! I may try here again and see in a couple of months if there's any difference. It's been two months already. Maybe it was just an off day or an off time. We will update in a couple few months."}, {"review_id": "ri0GV7ZJn8LmICPsdWMZWQ", "user_id": "apU84gOuDf8Aa8CCBA-Y7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Service was excellent. Kept reading about the sweet potato pancakes.  The waitress mentioned we could get samples.   3 of us got the samples. 1 of us had the actual order.  They were sweet and tasted like pumpkin pancakes. I ordered the BLT.  Can't mess that up. Others ordered waffles and egg sandwich. We all left full and happy. Our waitress offered us to go cups for our drinks which was really nice.  I had a bite of the sausage.  Yummy!  Wish I had ordered it now. A hint of spice.  Really good. Great breakfast spot. Bright and clean.  Definitely recommend."}, {"review_id": "Ca27TxZ4S_4Sd-P60MSNJg", "user_id": "qvM2FLaN1P9EPKn5orJNlA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I never dine in but they are always friendly and fast...

I believe our expectations were set just a tad high because of all the wonderful breakfast joints we had in California. That is not the case here. Besides Sunrise and Ruth's, Augusta is like a breakfast desert. That being said, the breakfast we had this morning was good and so was the service. My husband had the Mexican omelette and it was really tasty. I tried the three pancakes and two eggs dish and substituted sweet potato pancakes for regular ones. It was a great choice but so filling. I could only finish two of the three pancakes. They were fluffy and delicious. I wouldn't be so willing to turn my nose up to this place now and am glad we gave it a second try, even if it did take us three years to do it. I'm a sucker for a greasy spoon and will gladly come back."}, {"review_id": "H1FKftTtbfLglbEoOwO1vQ", "user_id": "3ExMeocDXZQqrvNHhJNuSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "Love the service and food!

I found it on Yelp! and the reviews made me want to try it. It was a Sunday morning and the wait was about 45 minutes. We didn't have time to wait; so we decided to dine at the breakfast bar since there were two new seats available. I opted for the French toast, because the menu said it'd be on Texas toast and I love trying new breads. It was thin and looked like regular white bread and tasted just OK. Nothing extraordinary. My omelet were cooked well but that's about it. I want to say the best thing about my breakfast this morning was my husband to the left of me and the friendly man to the right of me who kept talking to us and making the time go by.I can't fully remember what my husband ordered but I know he had potatoes with whatever it was and they were so dry and bland. The flavor was obsolete. I've tried it but I can't say I'll ever come back or recommend this place. It was simply - OK."}, {"review_id": "in8T64e5xIAy0d0tJ9LRBQ", "user_id": "BBcQCPa6Sn7XFj0PJe78vA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "Love this restaurant... we eat here virtually every weekend.  Great service and good food."}, {"review_id": "e-F11615kNHsUYp_xkEL6w", "user_id": "DutVKv2_Orvh9qG1uUOgsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2017", "text": "This place is way past cool.You gotta get here really early to get great seating not to mention the place was packed.I got the double stack of french toast with blueberries and the international delight vanilla iced coffee and I wasn't disappointed at all.I'll definitely be coming back in the future."}, {"review_id": "YxB3NrWnxhKMuIRUEeNQaQ", "user_id": "3-LZGayJbptTdepqz9scpA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/4/2017", "text": "Eh. I though it would be your typical breakfast joint to hit after church...not the prettiest place but yummy food! Well, the first part was right. We waited about 30-40 minutes for our table and I was surprised to see the menu...not many choices, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, the food was average and the service was above average...Alright, I'm going to come out with it. I saw servers eating behind the line while they waited for their food to come up. The bathroom, the horror of all horrors! Sooo NOT clean, which tells me the state of their kitchen...Sooo NOT clean! Trust me, if you've never worked in food service their is a direct relationship. Unfortunately, I found this out after I ate. I ended up changing my daughter in the back of my car, which was more sanitary than the bathroom.Thumbs down, not sure why it got 4 stars...."}, {"review_id": "LIbOulZfcD-XxeypvIfJyQ", "user_id": "_ltwOcmbeIBNLeHYRsOs7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "The BEST breakfast place in all of Augusta!

My husband decided that he would order a large omelet filled with meat, (of course), and a side of potatoes with grilled onions and pepper added and wheat toast.  I was delighted to see that there was a vegetable omelet on the menu so I ordered that along with breakfast potatoes and toast, My omelet was perfect because it had chunks of fresh broccoli (instead of finely chopped bits), tomatoes and onions with cheddar cheese.  It was very good and so were those perfectly seasoned potatoes.  We both enjoyed our breakfast and would definitely recommend this restaurant for breakfast. They open very early and serve breakfast all day."}, {"review_id": "7-edPqzNnD56IMOqqNGlIw", "user_id": "cGzstDI2_ep52sTLks7OFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "Great place for breakfast!

I told the waitress who agreed that was unacceptable and said she would talk to him. She did and immediately most of the line went on break. One cook came back in and took a knapsack off a shelf, then LAID it on the food prep surface so it touched the sliced cheese! He then pulled out cigarettes an passed them out to the remaining cooks. One poked his behind his ear.  I went to the register and relayed what I saw saying I would not be finishing my food.  The cashier said she understood and that she could take my drink off, \"but there is not much more\" she could do. So many elderly patrons love the grill because the staff is friendly.  I challenge them to SEE how poorly the kitchen run."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sunrise-grill-augusta?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
