So we got to the place and of course it was packed af. Some couple even tried to say they were there before my best friend and I. Not today, Satan. So we waited about 30 minutes before we could sit at the bar. I hate bar seats. Yet I quickly forgot that when the bar tender Manny walked up and smile. Not only was he amazing to look at, but he was super warm, kind, and attentive. He gave recommendations and also made great small talk. He certainly made this experience amazing.Oh honey, don't get me started on the food. We had a special pancake stack. It was reeses puff cereal in it. Honey, it was daf-ing delicious. I did not want it to end. But when our main meal came I was okay because this pork benedict was all the rage. Talk about yolking all over me. Honey, don't stop! I will come here again and again when I'm in DTSD for the weekend. It is one of my favorite bfast places ever!

Expect a 30+ minute wait if you go during prime times (ie. Saturday morning at 10 a.m.). Pros:-I enjoyed my chicken fried steak very much and the true highlight of the dish was the gravy. It was rich and flavorful.-The steak scramble was reasonable but nothing special. I thought the beef ate a little dry and the overall dish was a bit dry itself. I thought that maybe an over easy egg vs. a scrambled egg would have helped the texture a bit. Overall, still tasty, though.-The service and prices were reasonable for the location and the food. Expect to pay about $15 per person for each dish, not including drinks.Cons:-The homer pancakes were quite disappointing. They ate dry and were basically just pancakes with some icing and sprinkles over it. The raspberry did nothing. Do not order these. Overall, I enjoyed Werewolf and I think this is a great brunch spot. I wanted to try the pork belly benedict and that dish looked very tasty. Maybe next time."}, {"review_id": "B_aHvLqNydU7cD_TALTxLg", "user_id": "UiejIz8YNBZHwfO4eYjULA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Lovely environment, other than the startlingly numerous exotic species cadavers strewn throughout the restaurant.

What the bar like atmosphere lacks the for and service more than make up for. You've seen this before but please pay attention... GET THE BALLS if you do nothing else. I rarely go back to a place twice. For starters I am collecting for a book on breakfasts and I am alway on the hunt for a new place but Werewolf is one exception to the rule. The casual bar atmosphere combined with the amazing food makes this a mandatory stop for me. The huevos rancheros come over a quesadilla and the addition of pickled onions makes this dish jump off the plate at a rate that makes you question if even ate it. GET IT. NOW AND STOP READING YOU WONT REGRET YOUR DECISION!!In fact if your in town for 2 days eat here twice and get it both times."}, {"review_id": "yReBtISQdNEVmLf3_Sv3dA", "user_id": "YzJhIiwGnpQhPFzNOrFUoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Who would have thought small place like this would offer 5 star service and food? The breakfast menu is simple but food is complex and flavorful. The Kimchi bulgogi hash is amazing. The meat was tender, the eggs were runny and hash was crispy. The kimchi adds a an overall strong kick. Hash balls are crispy and not soggy. Gravy was creamy and had large quantity of bacon infused in it. Strongly recommend getting it with your meal to share! The breakfast burrito was as expected, crispy burrito with eggs bacon and side of salsa. Overall, I would come back to try there regular menu and to have drinks.

Great flavor, salty, and fatty topped with bacon and gravy, this was good and a promising start to breakfast.Then the other food came out, and the fattyness started to be overwhelming. Everything was just so greasy and heavy, my stomach couldn't handle it anymore. This may be our fault in what we chose to order, but independent of that, the food itself just wasn't that great.The steak in the scramble was dry and overcooked, but the biggest offender was the pork belly benedict. So many reviews had so much praise for this dish to the point where I was wondering if the kitchen had made mistakes preparing ours. The pork belly and underlying potato cake were fine, although I think pork belly is so trendy that people don't even know when they're eating a bad version. The main problem: the sauce. SO sweet, with a TON of an offensive spice. Couldn't quite place which spice it was, but it was a licorice-y flavor that I expect might be anise. It took over the dish to the point where it drowned out the pork belly, which is a flavor that's hard to drown out.With only one morning here since we were visiting from out of town, wish we had gone someplace else."}, {"review_id": "vDhwV-9RjP3ViTYQcp38rw", "user_id": "zvQ7B3KZuFOX7pYLsOxhpA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Loved it!I've heard of Werewolf for a long time now!

This was our 3rd stop of the night and we were already tipsy ha ha we had come from JSix and Searsucker.My BIL and sister was dyyyying since they're obsessed with this beer called Golden Monkey... I don't know anything about beer but they live in Norcal and they said they've never seen a bar have Golden Monkey on tap. They definitely enjoyed it. I'm blanking out on the food we got but I do remember we got sliders that tasted delicious for drunken food ha ha. They have a self-serve popcorn machine. I'm not really a popcorn fan but if it's $Free.99 then I'm down!

With so many great reviews I needed to give Werewolf a try. After you arrive you are greeted with a nice welcome. We did not have reservation. So we go seated before the rush hour.After being seated your drink order is taken. Within couple minutes later our server comes over to see if we had any questions on the menu. As it was are first time we needed couple extra minutes. Couple minutes later we decided to order are food. I had the country fried eggs and steak. A friend had the Quesadilia Huervos Rancheros. Â For a person who barely eats breakfast. I was impressed with the great selections for breakfast and brunch. The food was excellent. After one bite into my friend eggs and steak I was sold. No questions the food was excellent. If you are looking for a place in the heart of Downtown San Diego then Werewolf should be on your list. The customer service was excellent from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave. Our server was excellent. Every couple minutes a busboy came around to refill are drinks. Our server came around every five minutes to check if we needed anything.I look forward to coming back for dinner soon. You have a beautiful bar area to enjoy happy hour.

This restaurant is on the smaller side but there's a bar and even a live DJ woohooo! I love the causal, laid-back atmosphere.My friend and I ordered a Pork Belly Benedict ($14.95) and a Country Fried Steak ($12.95). Not pricey at all because their portions are pretty big!The Benedict was special because it was on latkes (potato pancakes). Never had it like that before and it was pretty good! The only complaint I have is that they added maple syrup to the dish and it was a bit weird having sweet and savory in the same bite, but it grew on me throughout the meal. Also, the pork belly was a BIT too hard for my taste (wish it was softer to compliment the eggs). The Fried Steak was really good - especially with the gravy. Super appetizing dish and I highly recommend this!I'm definitely going to come back here. It's in the heart of Gaslamp and it's such a cute area to explore, with a ton of shops open!"}, {"review_id": "nzLd4_p-e3iMaVG3nFUVqw", "user_id": "TwjiWvK0ZP15lzGC049oIQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "I am unsure why this place is highly rated, but my meal did not stand out to me as being amazing or great.

Â I also tried the pork belly benedict and it's a different take on eggs benedict, because they use a flattened potato instead of an English muffin.

They're really limited on seating, especially for big groups- so dine in smaller parties would be my recommendation. They have such a widespread menu. We came around 10am and had lots of breakfast items, bugulgi hash, pork belly, donut pancakes, and more! It was a bit embarrassing because at one point we had more dishes than table space, but we ate it all like champs. I really enjoyed their coffee bar. Such a simple thing--I wish more restaurants would do it. We had a vegan with us and there were very few options for her so perhaps this isn't the spot for them. The staff were all 100% amazing!

Validate your parking in the shoe department at Macy's - you don't even have to buy anything!Now, to the food... Let me begin by saying you don't want to leave here without getting an order of the Bulgogi Nachos. They were SO GOOD. They come with Korean BBQ steak, cucumbers, kimchi, cilantro, pickled carrots, dojo sauce, and sriracha. The best part? The chips are wontons, but in the shape of chips! Deliciousness! I ordered the Kiss Burger which was just their basic burger with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and their house sauce. It came with fries too. I'll be honest and say it wasn't my favorite burger, but it was decent and I was so excited about the nachos that I didn't even care.I will definitely be back for the nachos and I can't wait to try more from their menu too!"}, {"review_id": "lZRSInx5Pm8RaBns4goPMw", "user_id": "TlgEmDOTzK1O5o5qTnubhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "When I saw Werewolf on yelp, I saw that it has three things I wanted to try- the pork belly Benedict, the wings, and the kim chi bulgogi hash.

I would definitely get it again the next time. Their water tasted kinda weird? But maybe I'll ask for a lemon next time. I think this turns into a bar type place at night cause that's what it kinda looked like. They also had a dj who played all the jams the Sunday morning we came to visit.

Â Okay - this place is rated 4 1/2 stars. Â If you're new to San Diego and are looking for a cute brunch spot, this place isn't like The Cottage in La Jolla. Â There are no views or fancy brunch items.This is like, a dive-y/bar Â type of restaurant but it's hip and cool. Â They play some good music and have a casual atmosphere. Â Before arriving, I called to see what the wait was like and they answered the phone, \"Thanks for calling Werewolf, we like to party\". Â LOL. Â My kind of place.To my surprise, there was no 30+ minute wait and I was sat right away. Â If you're looking for bottomless mimosas, Werewolf doesn't have that on the menu. Â They do, however, have a bottle of champagne with free OJ for $12. Â It's an extra couple of bucks if you want some fancy blood orange or other flavored puree. Â We got the blood orange puree but honestly, you should just prob stick with the free OJ. Â Didn't really taste the blood orange and besides, let's face it - we don't want a lot of juice/puree anyway, we want the alcohol.Alright let me get to the food: Â I tried the breakfast burrito and the pork belly benedict. Â The breakfast burrito was good! Â Your standard breakfast burrito and when in San Diego, how do you mess that up? Â Right? Â Because you don't!!! Â I liked how the tortilla was slightly crunchy and so were the potatoes inside the burrito. Â Perfect-o! Â The pork belly benedict was heavy. Â While it was tasty, it was just a lot (and a little on the sweeter side for my liking). Â ALSO - where was the hollandaise sauce?? What's an eggs benedict without that? Â So in summary, this place is a cool place to come with your friends (prob a boatload of fun too to come here and party at night)."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/werewolf-san-diego?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
