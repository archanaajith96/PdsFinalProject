I ordered a custom pizza (Alfredo sauce with goat cheese, balsamic onions, artichoke, and mushrooms) and the goat cheese cheesecake, which was highly recommended by other yelpers. I could not have been more pleased and satisfied by this meal. In fact, I can't even remember the last time that I felt so content! The pizza dough consistency was perfect, and the ingredients were fresh and high quality. The cheesecake was so fluffy and the flavor was just more perfect than I could have imagined. To top it off, my server Cynthia was incredible! She went over and beyond for me, anticipating any need I might have.I only ended up eating 2 slices of pizza and had to take the rest home, but I have been dreaming about the next chance my stomach will allow me to eat another slice! I'm on a special autoimmune diet and unfortunately cannot eat out at many places. This place offers enough options for me that eating out at a nice restaurant can be part of my life again!"}, {"review_id": "0Zp4SQ044az3uSrnGD1lBA", "user_id": "1bhGCuBNnLK2ocicdg8njw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Great food, overall!

Our waiter, Andrew was pleasant and helpful. He made a few suggestions and didn't rush us. He was attentive all evening. My husband had the cheese ravioli and it is delicious! (He shared some with me ) I had the chicken pesto lasagna and it rocks!! The portion is large and so after my husband and I enjoyed it we took home a portion for tomorrow. I'm happy to be able to enjoy it again. I like the fact that there are vegan and vegetarian options that are delicious. It is the perfect place for an intimate dinner and has amazing options for all tastes.

We went with the roasted red pepper salad. Literally only spinach and red pepper - which is what it said on the menu I suppose but definitely not what you'd expect for $9 salad. We also got a pizza - half shroomy goat, half bbq chicken. The bbq sauce was definitely somewhat off. I felt the shroomy goat also had another odd flavor but I can't describe it.I suppose if you were gluten free this would be a great place because if their options but otherwise I think you can find much more tasty, interesting and/or economical pizzas around."}, {"review_id": "i8oGDbLXDxjOx4d6XzQgJw", "user_id": "HT8fywuIwxjT3fcWpYGrtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/26/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Torn.  I love this place.  The house wine is excellent.  The service perfect.  We ordered the happy hour flat bread and the spaghetti with meat sauce.    Renee's is a small restaurant success story.  However our food need a more flavor.  The meat sauce needed some red pepper and the flat bread as well.  These words may not mean much as the place is packed catering to the vegan crowd.  We enjoyed our time here."}, {"review_id": "sF-IWKUL-zv7pNnl-1HqZQ", "user_id": "HfbhhvNjc3uHKBtZQtsxew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "It was good & fresh I would go back !!

Nowhere is this posted in the restaurant or when you make a reservation. I suppose this is like Fight Club but restaurant style?-if the number in your party changes, even if by one, you must tell them in advance or face their wrath and shaming! God forbid anyone's plans changes - be sure to let the restaurant know immediately as I'm sure this is your number one priority when trying to juggle the plans of a busy day.- if you go over your allotted 90 minutes, you will be put on notice, even if you are waiting for food or in the middle of eating it. I truly understand the plight of small restaurants, however if turning tables is more important than the customer experience, please post it prominently and let the customers know as well when they book their reservation and also when they arrive at the restaurant.

You will only get quality at Renee's, in a sad culture of quantity over quality. There is a reason you can buy hamburgers for $1, you have sacrificed quality of ingredients, life of the animal, and possibly even negatively affected another person's life. You will pay true prices at Renee's and be voting in favor of a culture of quality over quantity. If quality and craftsmanship are not important to you, simply don't go there.
