It was good, very good. The decor is very cool too. You can get shirts from there and see all the photos of celebrities. I had one of there \"Award winners\" the Jim beam and coke burger. I was very happy with my choice. Also at the table we had the behemoth burger, (it was okay, still good, just not the star) the tombstone burger, and the kids burger. They even had a hatch green \"chili\" burger. We are from New Mexico, so it was cool to see this. (Pro-Tip though, in the New Mexico the green chile fruit is with an E. Chili is like the tombstone chili. :) ) We polished off our late lunch with some of their awesome milkshakes. The vanilla is the perfect vanilla shake. Simple beautiful vanilla flavor!We were a little taken a back by our server. He wasn't the most friendly, and we felt they were definitely trying to hurry our meal. They close at 4pm so don't eat there before 3:00. We finished our meal and left with our togo shakes about 3:00 and charts were already up on tables.Overall definitely go check this place out. It is worth the hype and I promise a good burger!"}, {"review_id": "IBNA0shTEEE0A8LN3VfqUA", "user_id": "7UCMMRxEZxqIZ7WDYjoyCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "A-freaking-mazing!!!  A must try in Billings.  Bursting with flavor and lots of unique combos.

We came in semi close to closing, yet they were friendly and welcoming. We ended up staying after closing discussing ghosts with the owners. On top of the fun conversation, our server was great, as was the food. The chili cheese fries weren't our favorite but the burgers were delicious. I have to admit, we were all jealous of my husbands burger with the cheese skirt burger. It was the BEST!  Fun place to stop, we recommend it!"}, {"review_id": "YScovK2ccRg3plDi8nuzEg", "user_id": "I3TP7JVbKkYTmp24VoPIEA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "PROS:-Great atmosphere, lively but not noisy, well-lit, bright colors, felt like I was in an 80's or 90's arcade/burger place. Really cool!-Service was great-Food was great! Great menu selections, dozens of specialty burgers and fries. Perfectly cooked with just a touch of pink. Juicy, fresh and very delicious. -Milkshake was amazing. It brought all my boys to the yard. I got \"Very strawberry.\" made with fresh strawberries. So good. -Food came out fairly quickly for how busy it was.-Prices were good.CONS:-Closes at 3pm daily.-No silverware on tables. (I like cutting my burger in half), just had to ask. No biggie. CONCLUSION:One of the best burger experiences I've had. Highly recommend. I'll be going back!

I always brag that The Burger Dive cooks up THE best, melt-in-your-mouth burger I've ever had the honor of devouring. Excited to try the new award-winning \"Huckleberry Sauce\" burger, accompanied by generous slabs of bacon, goat cheese, and arugula, it was simply amazing. Try it. And don't pass up the hand-cut fries either. Knowing I would be craving in a few hours, I ordered a 1/3 lb \"Thunderbolt\" burger to go; jalapenos, habaneros, ghost chili sauce etc. It kicked my ass but it was damn good. Finish your Burger Dive stay with a Flaming S'mores shake and complete your experience. Yes, they serve it on fire and ask for your preferred cook on the marshmallows. The entire staff is excellent. They have limited hours but if your schedule lines up, definitely stop by."}, {"review_id": "9iBcRZkh9HKnaIAt3fDLfg", "user_id": "qwwm1RH-B50FktJ0gzOe_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "I had the \"Best Burger in the World\" right here in Billings!

Parking was tricky because of the location downtown, but there is a lot directly to the building's right that doesn't require a permit. We came in around 11:30 because the tv show said it's not unusual to see a line out the door for a burger. Not the case for our visit, but it did fill up pretty quick closer to noon. We walked in, got seated right away and three different people asked if we had our drink orders taken. Great service!We ordered a basket of onion rings to share, the kids both ordered a burger and fries from the kid's menu, my hubby ordered a \"Date with Jim Beam and Coke\" burger, and I got the \"I'm Your Huckleberry\" burger with garlic fries. The burger and onion rings were spot on. I definitely preferred the o-rings to the fries.  So good. My daughter ordered her burger without cheese, it came to her with cheese, and the server exchanged it out right away. Our drinks were also refilled often. Once again, great service. Things that could make it better:- parking, of course, but there's not a whole lot the Burger Dive can do about that considering it's location. I guess we Out-of-towners just need to get a bit more savvy with downtown Billings!"}, {"review_id": "EBCUD1D_Vgnp8PN3h7Gi9Q", "user_id": "SkiV_RLC0wy1fqWM2rBTHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "My husband and I were driving through MT on a road trip from ND to CA, found The Burger Dive on Yelp and decided to give it a try.

They've also been on Man vs. Food. The San Fran Garlic Parmesan Fries were delicious, the burgers were amazing, and the staff was great. I'm so happy we chose to go here for lunch!

Having recently moved to Billings from Denver, I have done an extensive amount of \"homework\" on places to eat and time and again The Burger Dive popped up as something you must try. I am very glad to have visited!!It's definitely a divey diner, but with wonderful people working there and great food choices. I was pleased to see it is sit down service, not order at the counter-type. They have some great burger combinations, and while the patty wasn't the best I have ever had, I'm definitely all in for it being the total package with all the awesome toppings and combos offered. They had tasty buns too, which can totally make or break a burger experience. The kids menu had great options as well for littler appetites. And the milkshakes were definitely the \"cherry\" on top of the meal, so make sure you save room and plan to share because they're huge!The decor is all about the diner theme, and is very well loved. The staff hustled and at lunch time on a Saturday there were many times people had to wait. The wait for the food to come out was a little long, but as long as you're not in a hurry you probably won't even notice. And staff was available with drink refills, etc while you waited.I will definitely be bringing out of town guests here to show off this little Billings burger gem!"}, {"review_id": "SnwH2-8Oc7Bfrf5BjqE14A", "user_id": "cXjpGE2ocYzAZsI52N8FVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Holy cow that was fantastic.
