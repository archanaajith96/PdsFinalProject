Bakersfield has bottled magic, and it comes in the red salsa bottle on every table.  That stuff is delicious, and you will be tempted to just eat it with a spoon.  Great any time of day, only show the people you love this gem.My one critique is the music selection is often out of place for the atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "R040p98ReFtS93UHyHnLSQ", "user_id": "E-O_7_cFDoBylpJ5KvpTbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I literally love all the things about this place: the food, the drinks, the atmosphere and the price point!I have been here many times so I think I have had just about every menu item and there is not one I wouldn't have again.Fan favorites for our family: Queso with Chorizo and Gaucamole to start. The queso is unlike anything you have probably had before as it is creamy and has some harder melted cheese on it too. The chorizo adds a nice heat and additional flavor. The guacamole is fresh and loaded with big chunks of avocado. I could eat it with a spoon!The short rib tostado is a somewhat newer item for us to try and it is like having the best taco salad of your life with a fried egg on top!All their tacos are delicious but I truly think their fish taco is one of the best fish tacos I have ever eaten. The fish is crispy and there is a bright slaw on top that perfectly balances out the flavor profile.  Cochinita pibil is another great one and the heat level is just right.Make sure you round out your meal with a margarita and you will be insanely happy.  The price of the food for the quality is amazing and in my opinion much better than Nada where you will pay at least twice as much!"}, {"review_id": "aoKGq1LWJqOa_7rIrwDoOg", "user_id": "WZDaA2HhRlBgh3D13ErKCQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "I been to Bakersfield more than 3 times and it's always a good time.  The restaurant is sort of small but catchy, the ambience is very hip and casual. The only downside is the long wait to get a table.  This last time we were a bit disappointed because we put our name on the list and were told we would get a call which we never received.  Since it was 2 hours later we decided to just walk there and were promptly seated.  Other than that the service was great, the waitress was friendly and very attentive despite how crowded the place was.  We had the grapefruit margarita pitcher, and it was delicious.  It's safe to say that they have the best margaritas in town!  We also had different tacos I tried the hongos taco and pollo rojo they were delicious, it had the right amount of spicy.  It deft. a must go taco place!"}, {"review_id": "1i2uzBir7somLt-G04bHFg", "user_id": "aH1yb3sufdupVnlE8uazPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Soooo delicious I wish I could eat here everyday!!

No complaints but what I was not as impressed by was some of the food I got. I got three tacos: shrimp, al pastor, short rib. And madtree for my drink (good as usual). Shrimp taco was perfect...no complaints. Had lime avo dressing and cabbage radish slices on top. Maybe if you're not a fan of citrus that wouldn't be your favorite since avo dressing was strong citrus. Shrimp was lightly battered and perfectly fried. Al pastor taco wasn't as good as I would want it to be for 4$. It was really really dry. Short ribs way too salty and dry as well...so in all I didn't find the food that great, aside from shrimp taco, but the atmosphere and customer service was superb! I would have given an extra star if the food was better."}, {"review_id": "89DU4An1FzAJG1s5BpZdvg", "user_id": "JMUP-NR2Zlp7Gsz2rzE6pw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Tacos....tacos...tacos! Bakersfield you are officially my go to spot in Cincinnati for all my taco needs. While visiting in town for work, one of my friends in the area recommended this spot for its happy hour and tacos. Overall, I was delightfully surprised my the experience and quality of the food when I found out this was a \"chain\" restaurant.  Food wise I recommend the tacos ($4 a piece - the fish and cochinita) if you haven't noticed yet. The quality of the meat and the flavor combination, make these tacos worth while to come back time and time again. I will say that I also ordered the chips and salsa ($3), but should've just saved my appetite instead to try the other tacos on the menu. Anytime I am in town for work, I will definitely make sure to swing by this place, even if its not a Tuesday ;)"}, {"review_id": "VHVUdnsHkKfu7OPioOvMHg", "user_id": "IrJyYQUx15JE7vHW2jCXTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Mmmm Bakersfield.

I love the ambiance, drinks, and the food. The service is always quick and friendly. The downfall is normally you have a pretty good wait, especially on weekends, but as long as you're prepared for that and don't mind having a drink at a bar down the street it's not too big of a deal! To start, their margs are AMAZING. I was never an \"on the rocks\" girl until i tried these margs. Their queso dip is one of the best things I've ever eaten, sometimes my friends and i come to Bakersfield just for the dip and margs. Obviously, their tacos are delicious too.

As a place to hang out and have a few Bakersfield is..crowded. Like, really really crowded. Like you can't stand anywhere and not have someone bumping into you or trying to get around you crowded. While this is obviously great for their business it just does not make it a comfortable place to hang out at on a weekend night.The atmosphere is pretty cool..and I love that they play old episodes of Bonanza on the TVs all the time..but it's just not a chill spot overall. That being said, my girlfriend said they served up one of the best margaritas she has ever tasted. Now, she is a margarita connoisseur, so this coming from her is extremely high praise. I would come here again..just maybe on a much slower night. From what I hear those are few and far between..which I mean good for them. I've heard their food is excellent, but that you need a reservation to have any type of chance of being served (they seem to only have like 3-4 tables). I would for sure sacrifice my comfort if my girlfriend ever craves another one of those margaritas tho.

Honestly, outside of a couple dirty plates and a fruit fly infestation, the experience was flawless. We got chips and guac, which were extremely fresh (and quite possibly the best I've ever had).

This spot is the original (\"OG\") Bakersfield and it's definitely more cozy and intimate than it's Indiana sister. While I like the layout of the larger store, I definitely felt like this spot was less \"chain\" feeling. So, about the food -- these guys KNOW their tacos. I have never been disappointed by a choice I made off the small (but diverse) taco menu. I especially love the Pollo Rojo and the Baja Shrimp - so much delish red cabbage! Definitely choose some tacos when you visit Bakersfield, otherwise you'll be ogling someone else's all night. Drink specials rock here, we got a pitcher of Margaritas and managed almost three full glasses between three people. Not a bad deal! They also have daily shot specials - Monday is bourbon!

Medium sized venue garnished with rustic decor that reminded me of the tequila factories in mexico. Parking is rare on the streets, but there's plenty of parking in the underground parking lot at Jefferson park.THE BLACK AND WHITE: After arriving into Cincy, my buddy and I immediately started drinking...eventually that drinking turned into hungerness. I was feeling tacos and he recommended Bakersfield. ***WARNING - wait times are ridiculous for dinner, however they do take down your number and call you when a space opens up. Our wait took 2 hours for a 2 person table. We ended up going to another bar and drinking there before receiving the table open text.The menu is pretty big, but my friend recommended us to just eat the tacos. They're on the more expensive side (~$4 a taco). When I was in mexico, I got 3 tacos for $1! We first started off by ordering the pineapple margarita, which was super delicious. I was kinda disappointed they didn't bring it to us in a pineapple. You could have the option of having the rim lined with chipotle salt.For an appetizer, we got the guac and chips. Let me tell you, the chips here were soooo good. I think it may have been the lime salt on them, but I would've been happy even without the guac. You could tell the guac was freshly made and it was a pretty big portion size. As for tacos, I got 3 (mole, spicy mahi, and short rib). My favorite was by far the spicy mahi. I love fish tacos (especially fried fish) and the spicy mayo made it the perfect taco. The mole was good but wasn't as chocolaty as I expected. Short rib is always a safe choice.THE FINAL BAMBOO: Overall damage was $32.82 including tax and tip. I was thoroughly stuffed. OTR is headed in the right direction with restaurants like Bakersfield."}, {"review_id": "bKY6eEYeVclPtN7w_ux_1g", "user_id": "m5fXkHqZDF5Jh0Cpn8F2Sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Stopped for dinner before a weeknight show downtown - arrived early which was a good thing because the restaurant is small and the seats were gone by six - not that waiting with their special Grapefruit Margarita would necessarily be a bad thing but if you want food fast arrive before 5:30.  And a word about that special margarita - it needs a perm place on the menu - the grapefruit cut the sweetness and made for an excellent cocktail - we didn't have their regular version but have had it at the Indy location and it was also top notch - assume Cincy is the same.  Bakersfield has a good selection of draft beers - years ago I had my very first Agave Wheat from Breckenridge and they always Rhinegeist and Madtree rotating but their margaritas are made with fresh lime juice and you shouldn't really have them any other way.   Tried the Chips & Queso and the Guacamole (the guac is made throughout the day) and was impressed with both - the guac let the avocado be the star and the queso was different take on the standard white cheese both were excellent apps.  But you go to Bakersfield are the tacos and while the tortilla (again fresh made in house) may be on the small side they are absolutely stuffed with whatever form of goodness you chose to fill them.  Between four of us we managed to order twelve and while I could sing the praises of each just go with your particular taste and you are going to be happy.  Will give a special shout out to the Al Pastor with slightly spicy marinated pork offset with sweet pineapple - I could have had three of those and gone home with a smile.   I didn't notice the habanero hot sauce until too late - next time.  Service was efficient - especially given the tight quarters and common table.  Prices while not cheap are extremely fair given the quality of the ingredients - the pitcher of the special margarita for $38 was a bargain - glad I didn't have to share (kidding....not kidding)."}, {"review_id": "eiJ1J5KKk7UZ_laIJEYjlQ", "user_id": "W6-yswnp2ZEKh8pVIHmarw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Popular spot for margarita pitchers in Over the Rhine. They do seasonal margaritas, also, as well as some other cocktails and they usually have a decent beer selection. I love getting splitting a pitcher and some guac when I come here! Tacos are pretty spot on, too. Only reason I'm not giving a full 5 stars is the set up. It gets pretty busy on weekend nights, and they have a standing/island bar in the back between the bar and the kitchen area. I don't mind standing there and drinking while waiting for a table to open up but it just creates a big cluster on busy nights. I feel like there could be a better use of the space there.
