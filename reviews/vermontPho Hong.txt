I'd move here just to eat here on a regular basis. This is a lucky town.The pho was probably the best I've had outside of south east Asia. I had the veggie pho and my boyfriend had the chicken. He said the same thing. Best of his life. It's also just so nice to order vegetarian pho and not get water instead of a lovely flavorful broth. The vegetables were big and bright and fresh! Absolutely delicious. Not overcooked at all.The portion size was amazing and at a very good price.The front of house staff were very attentive and hard working. As someone who works in hospitality this whole experience was refreshing and delightful.28 stars out of 5."}, {"review_id": "m2DlY9sFnZUnxea8790qdA", "user_id": "Dq_Jkpx4xpbh4iofayOr6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Pho Hong is a solid Viet restaurant in Burlington. The service is excellent, the fellow diners are friendly, the restaurant is BYOB and the food is good.Three of us came here for a dinner. The snow was softly falling and there was about an inch of powder on the ground. We bought beer and hard cider from Winooski and left it outside in the powder.The line was 7-8 people long and the restaurant is small. We waited about 45 minutes before we were seated. However, the time went by quickly due to my companions. It was cold outside but Pho Hong's staff placed a heater by the door, so when the draft blew by, the heater warmed you as soon as the door closed. That was a nice touch.While waiting, we were informed that the beef broth ran out. When we were seated, we were informed that one bowl of vegetable broth was left. I got the beef pho with veggie broth. K ordered spicy Thai curry and H got a chicken stir fry in fried noodle nest. The broth was good, solid but didn't taste as richly unami as pho from Philly. The spicy Thai curry was creamy coconut-y and a tad sweet but tastes good. The stir fry was well executed and the noodles were very crispy.The waiters and host were great at updating us about wait times, what was sold out and bringing us hot tea. I would definitely return."}, {"review_id": "E-pdo9WuU33kSVT4vywgvQ", "user_id": "Oavbr8dUe96Ap75kSwHhww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "VT doesn't have a whole lot of Asian restaurants, let alone pho restaurants. It just doesn't, don't argue with me.  So after several days of eating meat and potatoes and drinking heavy ass beer (liquid bread, anyone?) the boyfriend and I decided to eat something pho-like.  I ordered just the normal pho with a bit of everything and it was decent.  Not the best, but still tasty enough to recommend it if you're craving something authentic.  I remember the server staring at me like I was crazy when I asked for the jalapeno slices when they brought out the garnishes.  Granted it's not in season in dead of winter in VT, but maybe they don't do that in VT? I thought it was nice for them to bring me some thai chilies instead.  I'm good with that. The food was 3.5 but I'll bump it up because the folks seem really friendly here.  Come early, it gets packed pretty quickly."}, {"review_id": "PH8RlsihzghRJIvH-ijehw", "user_id": "7D7zq_LkD1YfgZhJPP6zBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "This is a really solid restaurant in the area. We ate lunch here at 1 pm on a Saturday afternoon and the restaurant was quite full. We ordered #15 and #7. The service was efficient and friendly. They provide a scented green tea that I really enjoyed. #15 was flavorful, fresh, and full of fresh vegetables and herbs. The chicken in this dish was tender and aromatic. The spring roll really topped it off and made it a truly satisfying meal. #7 was a solid bowl of pho. The broth, brisket, and noodles were on point.

Great food for a good price. It is my go to spot for pho and Vietnamese food. There is almost always a line and some wait time. But every time I go there, we get treated very well. I have only waited for about 10-20 minutes each time, so it is not bad. It is a cozy little restaurant and at times can get pretty loud.I almost always get either the #1 Cha Gio or the #4 Goi Cuon as an appetizer. I typically order the #8 Pho Dat Biet, it has a mixture of everything. The broth is flavorful and fresh. If I'm feeling a cold dish, I usually get #13 Bun Thit which is vermicelli with grilled pork. Their curries are also pretty good. Definitely recommend this place since Burlington does not have many Asian food options."}, {"review_id": "RAiEKpQIb3Ld_eI_bejUdA", "user_id": "ESB0X8T2yxwW6q-Wt5MynA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "What a surprise to find this lifeline of a restaurant in the boonies.  Sorry, VT.  No offense.  That's why I loved visiting your state.  So beautiful.  Anyhow, I was there to run the marathon in May.  A had a big hot piping pot of pho to load up on carb the day before and went back to replenish after finishing my race.  I can't remember the name, but it was a duck dish, which was just so amazingly good."}, {"review_id": "IX8o8L7ofTv3wQqS6pQ_2A", "user_id": "Lissq0O6G9yaRM4cjoGx7w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Pretty tasty Vietnamese food.

It is exactly what you want in terms of savory soup, throw in the crisp brussel sprouts and a squirt of lime. I am a flavor of sri-cha so it goes spicey. But really great pho - goes down so well. My only regret is there are never enough noodles for my liking. Great price though so you can afford 2 bowls and still pay less than for lunch elsewhere in Burlington.

And it was WORTH IT. Love that they greet you with complementary hot tea. I got the mango salad to start and chicken pho for an entree. I am a big pho fan and have tried probably 15 pho places in recent years and this one might actually take the cake. If not, it is definitely in the top 3. Service is great and my food came out really fast. It is a BUSY place and rightfully so.

This place exceeded my expectations and has one of the best vermicelli bowls I've ever tasted. I got the tofu one, and the flavor on the tofu was so flavorful. I also got the Vietnamese crepe with tofu, which was also phenomenal. The tofu was a bit bland compared to the one in the vermicelli, but the crepe itself was delicious. Everything, from the service to the tea they serve was great. It was busy, especially for a Thursday afternoon, and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, which was nothing compared to weekend and dinner hours.
