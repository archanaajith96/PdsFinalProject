They have a good sized menu and the service is very friendly.I love their pancakes and eggs. I have also had eggs with hash browns that were very good. I have had the eggs benedict and they were pretty good, but not great.I love all the pancake offerings and I will stick to that next time I am in town.They owner/mgr is very sweet and we had a lovely time."}, {"review_id": "AIeR5Y11iKrVyA7vsspzKQ", "user_id": "pOp4WHssRXadN4oR6_Ku7A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "Date of visit: 11/25/17Little road trip to this restaurant on a late Saturday morning.  We arrived about noon and were seated promptly. Restaurant appears to be undergoing some renovating since I seen some unpainted drywall on some of the walls otherwise it was clean and full of patrons.The skillets looked good but the pancakes looked a bit flat as I glanced at the meals order by some nearby diners. Not wanting any egg products today I decided on the potato pancakes and my wife had her usual  plain waffle. Coffee was a bit slow to be serve at the table and the refills came slowly but the coffee was very good. Breakfast was served complete and hot.The  potato pancakes were more pancake than potato and were a bit on the gummy side. My side of sausage links was the type that was light and tasted more of filler than meat. My wife enjoyed her waffle but her side of hash brown (which she requested well done) were not well done.  They hash brown were  small cubed potatoes that had more of the taste and texture of a plain chopped baked potato than shredded hash browns. Not bad but just not our style. They tasted worse as they got colder.All in all I would not intentionally make the trip back here but if I did I would definitely order something else."}, {"review_id": "nR9VIIxiA2nuJUc06z_PpA", "user_id": "z1MrDoE-VVaLLHhUFwKDkw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "If you have been feeling a little constipated and in need of dire relief then I would suggest coming to this place.

Every time I go back to Naperville I always make sure to make the drive into Aurora to get their delicious omelettes.My family and I typically go on Saturday or Sunday mornings and the place is always packed. I usually mentally prepare myself for around a 30 minute wait. The place has that divey breakfast diner feel which is very comforting and nostalgic albeit not always the cleanest. Service is usually a toss up depending on who you get but most of the time the servers are friendly and take orders and bring out food at a relatively good pace especially given how busy they always are. Every time I go I always order the country omelette. The sausage gravy works perfectly with the giant fluffy omelette that brings about a hint of sweetness. Their steamed potatoes aren't the best a bit bland and not moist enough at times but their Greek toast is delicious as well especially when drenched in butter All in all, definitely a favorite spot in the suburbs and though it does have its faults I'm always excited to go back whenever I get back to Illinois."}, {"review_id": "BGmRN6II8KSfcDXZ0xWj_Q", "user_id": "tIk0MKA7pl4bYDOE0-OYwg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Always love coming here. Prices are already a good deal but then you still get deals from Groupon and coupons from the mail so its always a win dining here. Its a lovely home-y ambience and pancakes are always fluffy and yummy. Great welcoming service all the time we've been here and condiments on the table are always well-stocked.

Our kids have swim lessons in Aurora on Sunday mornings and a quick search on Groupon and Yelp got us to Blueberry Hill.They were packed on Sunday but the wait staff was moving things along pretty fast. I ordered the corn beef hash, the kids got the Mac and cheese and Mrs ordered the breakfast combo. The food came in quick, the coffee was well brewed and the service was outstanding. I got nothing but good vibes from this place.My corn beef hash was average which is what I expected."}, {"review_id": "I4mQGATGwB2QytMRnWGUtA", "user_id": "UuIr2WKA0gZRyRvWIlAduQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "Every breakfast place is so crowded on a Saturday or Sunday morning. Blueberry Hill is one of the few places that we were able to walk in and get a seat right away. They were definitely busy, we just arrived at the right time.They have your usual breakfast/lunch fare - pancakes, crepes, waffles, skillets, egg dishes, french toast, wraps, salads, etc. They do have some different items on the menu that I haven't seen before, like Captain Crunch french toast. Their prices aren't bad, but the service was a little slow and the food lacked flavor. I had a skillet, and it was dry, partially burnt, and needed salt. I would come back, but I would try something else. Maybe they were having an off day. But that wasn't the best breakfast I've had."}, {"review_id": "IewPBSFg5YsAs1rCgvGGKA", "user_id": "OxWxQWI8rWZrFwRWJO2ocw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This is my favorite breakfast spot.

This diner is one of those super homey, comfy diners that open super early (6am!) and even if it's dead the servers make sure you're attended to without neglect nor over attention. Tried their now year round pumpkin pancakes and as someone who doesn't believe you can make pancakes worth craving--I was proven wrong. The perfect balance of sweet, soft yet slight crunch with their thick homemade (potentially mascarpone) sauce made for such an irresistible combination I was actually relieved the server knew when I was full that a to go box would be in order. So the short of it is this is a truly charming and delicious local treasure; I really hope you give this place a shot."}, {"review_id": "nqW2RlZLoLr2m7o1ybmqyA", "user_id": "I7r34of9vv6pNCmUtl4PSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "The food was very good and my waiter was super nice.

There are several Blueberry Hill Pancake Houses in the surrounding areas and this one does not disappoint.The main reason is that the quality of the food is always 100%. Everything comes out piping hot, delicious, and exactly as described.  If you go please, please, please, at least add some pancakes on your order. They are simply the best ever. I don't know how they do it, but these pancakes are scrumptious and delicious. You won't be sorry!We usually get take out from this place because my Father In Law loves this place but wants to eat it for dinner.

One of the older bus boys became upset with a young bus boy (because of an accidental bump). The older man began cursing (in the open dining room) and punched the guy- hard. In his angry outburst, his elbow hit my fiancé. I literally could not believe I was witnessing this behavior. The man seemed completely unhinged. My fiancé asked to speak to the manager and there was only a dismal apology and then business as usual. I will not support a restaurant that: 1. Doesn't take verbal and physical abuse seriously2. Doesn't have the professionalism to give a genuine apology 3. Only cares about turning a table and not on the dining experience of paying customers. I wouldn't even give it one star if that was possible!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/blueberry-hill-pancake-house-aurora?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
