It's their best dessert yet that I've tried and that's really what this review is about. I love lemon flavor and the Lemon Bundt Cake is so vibrant and fragrant. It's sweet yet still has the tartness that you get from a lemon. Plus, it's incredibly moist with just the right amount of frosting; I hate when cakes are smothered with more frosting than actual cake. Not to mention, this lemon bundt cake even earned them a shout-out from Nigella Lawson on ABC's The Chew- pretty impressive! Everything else is made vegan and you really wouldn't know it. I've never spent much time hanging around in Mud Pie, but it's located in what looks like a charming little house. There is a decent amount of seating though and I can imagine it is a nice place to get some work done. I usually don't have much trouble finding parking either in the parking lot or on the street and there are some nice shops within walking distance to stop by as well."}, {"review_id": "XxsepAH96fsNQU-iigZ3VQ", "user_id": "Qco4F0hPEiBI5gYSzKTV5A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Adorable little coffeehouse and bakery off of 39th by KU medical! It's a refurbished house with two floors and 5 unique areas/rooms (including a chill living room and children's room equipped with toys). My friend and I camped out upstairs in the room that had a view of the medical center!   They have board games and books inside, if you want to come hang out with friends.I ordered the iced homemade chai latte, and it was quite honestly one of the best chai that I've had!! It was smooth, sweet, and \"spicy\" (cinnamon and cloves added a kick).All was fine, but it didn't really seem like the workers wanted us there, as they were not so friendly to us.

Just keep in mind that this place is quiet and most everyone was studying (at least the time we went there), so it was hard to find a place inside that my mom and I could chat.

And coffee for that matter! Everything on the menu is made with milk alternatives; even the pastries. I came here before work not too long ago. I ordered an iced mocha and a German chocolate cupcake. To me, a vegan cupcake doesn't taste any different than a non-vegan one. Its really good though! I don't have much of an opinion on the coffee. It wasn't nothing spectacular. I like that this place is all vegan though; no mess ups (unless you're allergic to nuts or something)."}, {"review_id": "3IxeDcrAM5H3b8WyGb_N9g", "user_id": "Ln4cZIpX3-_jd1xyL4NJLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "Mud Pie is a home turned cute bakery that offers a pretty mean vegan muffin. While I have stopped by in the past, I had never gotten any of their vegan baked goods, and boy, I am starting to regret that now.My friend and I came in this morning and both got the peary ginger muffin (the lame food pun lover in me was fan-girling). To both of our surprises, the workers informed us of their special from 7am-9am: if you buy a muffin, you can also get a small coffee for $3.50 (the muffins are $3.50. So, free coffee? Yes please!) Both my coffee and muffin were enjoyable; however, the muffin was especially delectable. While the pear flavor of the muffin was strong, it was not overbearing. On top of that, the muffin was nicely baked, warm (we asked the worker to heat up our muffins) and moist on the inside. I would have never have guessed that this was a vegan muffin if you didn't tell me.There was also plenty of seating at Mud Pie as well. Each of the small, cozy rooms (on both floors) had a good amount of tables and chairs. It did get a little cold while I was working there. So, I would highly suggest layering up if you spend a of couple hours here. All in all, Mud Pie Vegan Bakery & Coffehouse offers some of the best vegan baked goods I've ever eaten. I'd definitely recommend this place as it has great study spaces and great snacks to munch on!"}, {"review_id": "dqMiZ1NWV8FgBWFPq9n4Uw", "user_id": "bGNQ2CL9WfNQumULmljvLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "I've spent many a day here, surrounded by the hum of conversations and the vibrant smell of coffee. I've worked in here, eaten here, come in just for coffee, and come by just 'cause. It's safe to say that Mud Pie is my favorite cafe in Westport so far. The staff are always warm and welcoming, the coffee is great, and the vegan treats are my favourite! The cafe is located in a cute, yellow house that essentially has seating placed in it. Yet, the house is what makes Mud Pie so quirky and unique and has me returning more often than not. I've sampled a variety of drinks and treats here with the latte being my favorite and the sheet cake being so good, it was inhaled within minutes. I also find that Mud Pie a great place to work. With my notes spread out around me, accompanied by others alike, this is the perfect place to get some serious work done.

The bakery/coffee shop is in a 2 story house on 39th, with seating areas on each floor. The upstairs seating area is perfect for a quiet get away from normal coffee shops that have music in the background or loud crowds. ONLY downside about the upstairs is there is a children's play area (kind of  out of place in my opinion, children don't need coffee they're already overly energetic ).   The lattes are exceptionally delicious. They use soy milk, something I had never had before until their lattes and to my surprise I prefer it much more to other traditional lattes. The chai lattes are delicious as well. THEIR PASTRIES O M G. They are to die for. It doesn't matter if you're vegan or not, all of their regular and vegan pastries are amazing. Highly recommend anything pumpkin they make in the fall. I haven't tried any of their savory pastries, but literally any pastry you get will leave you satisfied. Oh honeyyyyy"}, {"review_id": "eE_RGUpIE3MIu9S3HedLYA", "user_id": "QgdkOcuZmkSVtXDFrJthaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Loved their coffee. And the owner is just an amazing guy!!

The large and bright yellow (or is it orange?) 2-story house, which houses (literally) the bakery, can be easily spotted from 39th St.  They share a very small parking lot with other business, and it was completely full, but we lucked up on close curbside street parking.Once inside, we were warmly greeted. There were lots of goodies from which to choose: cupcakes, muffins, cookies, scones, brownies, and cakes slices. I got a couple of cupcakes and a salted caramel bar. The cupcakes were moist and the icing was very sweet and buttery/creamy. Delicious vegan sweets, friendly employees, and fair prices. KCMO is lucky to have this gem."}, {"review_id": "rFCP7awGqu7RT7TI4HQcXg", "user_id": "hnLAIE_csZ4q5P8srx6-eg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "My mom described it best, Mud Pie Vegan Bakery is a very eclectic place meant for people who enjoy that environment. Personally, I appreciate unique coffee shops that carry their theme from their food and drink options to their decoration and seating areas; however, I know my mom is more accustomed to the more upscale locations. I've been wanting to go back to Mud Pie since I had been there two years previously. I appreciate how they have an excess of vegan options that appeal to those who have taken on that type of lifestyle. The bakery is located on 39th street in a converted home and surrounded by a plethora of other unique restaurants.The best part about this coffeehouse is the excess seating options as they have an outside patio as well as upstair room for customers to do their work. For the middle of the day, I was surprised to see many people entering and leaving the coffeehouse, and there were customers who were utilizing the patio outside as well. The baked goods looked absolutely delectable, and my mom tried the Zucchini bread while I tried the bar called coconutz. To drink, I ordered the 16 oz latte, and my mom opted for the homemade chai latte with almond milk. I did appreciate how the drinks were automatically made with soy milk and was not an extra charge, but customers are also able to try their homemade coconut, almond, or cashew milk for an extra charge. We especially enjoyed the baked goods, and I would certainly recommend the coconut bar which tasted like a vegan version of a seven layer bar. The drinks were not especially unique; however I would definitely return to try more of their baked goods and utilize their study spaces."}, {"review_id": "Yo4eryh7IeDlI2tp1DS8CQ", "user_id": "d0iLCuZuhVqG02jT8ibAaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I came in to explore Kansas City and it's vegan restaurants and options before I move here and Mud Pie was top of my list, and rightfully so!

From what I saw, their bakery case had donuts, cookies, cupcakes, scones, bundt cakes, and plenty more! They have a separate section for gluten free treats (I ordered one), and the staff even made sure to ask if I needed it separate from my other items. They also had a separate area for their peanut butter treats.

I have always grown up with the ideology that food always had to have an animal product to make it delicious- butter, milk, honey. This place challenges the notion that animal products make food taste amazing. I had the pumpkin doughnut and was fluffy, flavourful, and moist. The topping had the same consistency of crystallized sugar. The coffee was refreshing newness- I had a latte with the use of cashew milk. I was given the impression by the barista/host that it would be similar to milk(I don't it was). It was worth the experience, but will stick soy milk.

I have been in here several times yet have *never* had an interaction with an employee that I would classify as warm, nor even polite. \"Perfunctory\" comes to mind.Now, look, I'll admit that on occasion I have come up to the counter with a Groupon on my iPad. But if you're going to constantly offer Groupons, especially a set of three in each order (I've learned my lesson and haven't bought one since), then you better expect people to redeem them and not be jerks toward them when they do.Anyway, every time I've come to Mud Pie I've been met with a worker at the register who doesn't smile nor doesn't really answer questions that I have or respond to conversations that I try to start with more than a sigh and a word or two. Then, I'll stand to the side and wait for the worker making the drinks to call out my name (it is on the cup, after all) except... they don't call my name. They just silently put it on the counter, letting it sit until I ask if it's mine, even though other people's names are called.From the looks of the other reviews either I'm being too sensitive or I've just had the misfortune of having a string of bad customer service incidents. Whatever the case, there are enough places that have vegan options that I don't need to go to Mud Pie when I am in the mood for something vegan."}, {"review_id": "NlPKXP7wOTA3RWNPpU13zQ", "user_id": "w8pR9GGiPaM56-kQhYkaZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "My latte was made perfectly.

I was so surprised at the excellent options. I'm kind of glad I don't live here because I would be broke from this place alone. I had the espresso muffin and a latte with coconut milk and I have never had such wonderful coconut milk. It was certainly divine. The flavor was really some of the best coffee I've had in the past few years - smooth, not bitter, and medium roast so not too strong. The muffin was not too sweet and the bits of chocolate were heavenly. Lots of references in this review to the food being out of this world good - and it is. I bought an extra krispy bar for the road and devoured it at the airport and wished I'd bought a few more bakery items to bring home on the plane. I was greeted immediately and the barista guy made some recommendations as well - that was most welcomed. I would come back here if I was within 60 miles of this place - and I'd make a special trip.
