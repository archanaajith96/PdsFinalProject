Food is fantastic, especially considering the value.We kicked it off with a hummus and tabouli plate. The classic, pita chips and freshly baked (or at least warmed) soft pita, tabouli on a bed of lettuce and hummus served with sliced grape tomatoes, olives, fresh parsley and olive oil. Perfectly creamy hummus was perfectly creamy. Tabouli a solid balance of savory spices, bite and tang from tomatoes and onion. I gladly consumed the beef gyro with fattoush. The gyro set itself apart from typical flavors by adding a host of spices, chiefly some extra (not overwhelming) cumin, most gyros are desperately lacking. All in all, even for an inexpensive lunch, I left quite satisfied, bordering on full. 10/10 will recommend to a friend."}, {"review_id": "BeoQw3e0TSKuWcQlQDDjVA", "user_id": "dEN0lzaATPQOKuu687nAKg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "If you're looking for a delicious foodie adventure experience then this place is not for you. However, if a friendly neighborhood deli is what you're after for an informal lunch that will fill your belly and leave you with extra lunch money then you're on the right track! The gyro with a fatoush salad always does the trick for me when I can't decide where I want to have lunch. It's quick, light, and fairly cheap. The owner is always around to greet and chat up the customers."}, {"review_id": "LszFSN0Leh5dw9zi0SYFww", "user_id": "UCXa9Y7D_I1DrEh3xBMlUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Amazing. Just amazing, everything. My big favorite is the chicken curry soup!!!!  It's the best soup I've ever had. I love it, could eat it every day. It has such great ingredients and is so flavorful!!! Sweet and savory, curry flavor awesomeness. Try it. Seriously, I don't think anyone could dislike it. The hummus & pita is delicious! Perfect pita! The salads are always amazing. I've always loved the Caesar, but I also love the Fattoush! So great! Perfect flavors, and crunch from the pita chips.  Very great salads. The beef gyro is amazing. The yogurt-cucumber sauce is delicious! The BEEF!!!  wow! Perfect, tender, marinated, tasty grilled meat! Yumm. The romaine, tomatoes, onion, and copped pickles provide great crunch and are great additions!! It is so good. THE PITA THOUGH  so warm, fluffy, and delicious. The shawarma is also great, it has delicious flavor also! The chicken is awesome! It's a wrap so it's lighter, still amazing. Staff is wonderful, I believe it's family owned and operated which is admirable! I get a lot of take out from here and it's always amazing fresh and fast! Definitely an amazing little deli, it's one of my favorites. Convienant location!"}, {"review_id": "luc-hP183cLJLlccKfjWMA", "user_id": "I05z2F4gh5gEBSLu68WoUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Don't let the deli scares you thinking it's just sandwich place. It has Mediterranean taste. I got chicken shawarma and like it. I wish they would provide more sweet potatoes fries, the  portion was small maybe  cuz I think it was just so good. A friend got beef gyros which was just the right amount with pita bread and hummus. That was good.  Not bad on pricing."}, {"review_id": "W9Smz-pFcpMfkE-6IbVRsw", "user_id": "SuImdF2Ox_EhlJn33owIlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/17/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Quick & easy pick up for a light and refreshing- super yummy meal!!

The dressing is spot on & incorporated perfectly!"}, {"review_id": "NGuyOhGC2eVs30blDoTehw", "user_id": "t8ZnKvPt9PKWbciHfU_QEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Vegans, don't be frightened by the word Deli.

The beef kabobs was really good and so was the chicken swarmah and sweet potato fries. The raspberry chicken salad was a touch too sweet so you might ask for less dressing if u do try it. Their desserts are to die for. So many to choose from and so gorgeous to look at. They tasted delicious. We had the chocolate cake and strawberry cheesecake and salted caramel cheesecake and they were all good. We all enjoyed it. The waitress and the owner was super friendly and attentive."}, {"review_id": "yGdiwxu1iwLlGsrTY7-4Rg", "user_id": "8APcvzsQDCEqb1rGBynHVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/5/2017", "text": "College hill deli is one of my all time favorite lunch spots in Wichita.

It's a nice clean place with a sunny vibe. The staff are friendly and the service is really quick. The owner is really nice and you can tell he gets to know all his customers. They don't have halal meat but they have a good selection of vegetarian options and the prices are fair. The hummus is delicious and the pita that it comes with is soft and my favorite type of bread. I got the falafel sandwich and it was the perfect combination of crispy and soft. It comes with a side of fries. The portion of fries is a little small than what I would like, but they tasted delicious nonetheless. We also got the fattoush salad which was really good as well. They also had a really good selection of cakes and desserts. We didn't have room to try them though.

I ordered a cup of lentil soup to go with it, but Def it was the gyro that shined.All the desserts I tried were decadent.  The chocolate fudge was rich and moist, and I enjoyed the bit of bite the chocolate shavings provided.  The carrot cake was chock full of walnuts and also very moist.  They were too sugary for me, but I can see how these were two of the top 3 desserts (the other one was the lemon cake).  The generous women that worked there gave me two pieces of baklava (glad to have tried it once) b/c  it, like all their desserts, were special ordered.  The service was just great, and it reminds me why it's good to support local."}, {"review_id": "353w6qQ_ytmMZVk04WVqeA", "user_id": "pFsPn7LwYeFzLDhKfrIBdw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/21/2016", "text": "Mediocre Mediterranean Mom & Pop ShopBeef Schwarma is lackluster in seasonings and they put way too much sauce to the point where I can't taste the beef.
