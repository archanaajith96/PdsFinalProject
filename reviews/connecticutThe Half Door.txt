Not only do you get to enjoy the great outdoors of Hartfords West End given whether New England decides it wants to be nice out, or what kind of crazy you want to experience. You also get the nice dark ambience of indoors (again refer back to previous sentence), it's pretty much what I picture Diagon Alley to be. If you like music occasionally you can enjoy live bands or an actual drunk Irish man who happens to be in town sing you a tune (yes it's happened to me).  Now for food, their wings I actually dream about they are perfectly crispy and the garlic parm are one of my favs! Bring on the wet naps! Also the cobblestones are big honorable mention as well, I mean they are cute the names clever and you can't go wrong with steak and cheese. Now saving the best for last the booze. They have so many options and for a beer  connoisseur hops-oisseur (was that clever? Let's pretend) you get a wide variety from all over but if your basic like me I just stick to what I know, aka a blue moon. All in all a great place, and I recommend anyone to stop by even if it's just once!"}, {"review_id": "Rr4_oQIm4UecYJZxTzlTMA", "user_id": "lkTwYs1rlUa8uS2K9nvcyg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I have never had to leave a review like this before and I'm a little sad that I actually have to write a review like this. We came in for brunch today after all the positive reviews and a really nice menu. We walked in about half past 10 on a Sunday morning. The place was pretty empty and we were standing around waiting to be seated and after a while the bartender told us we could seat ourselves at any open spot.We sat at our table for a few minutes and finally someone came by to drop off two menus. He didn't ask us if we wanted waters or a coffee. Once we decided what we wanted, we waited for a server to come by to take our order. No one came. During the 15 minutes or so we were waiting at our table, two couples came in. Both were told right away where to sit, unlike us. One of the couples sat at the same long table as us, on the left side; we sat on the right. Someone came to them right away with menus. He got them their drinks right away and their utensils. We still decided to wait, no one came.There were multiple servers just standing around, one by the bar with the bartender just chatting, one in the back by the kitchen just talking, and one guy help a couple sitting at the same table us. I have never walked out of a restaurant before, ever. Today was my first time. They were not ageist as there was a variety of ages in the customer group and the servers and bartender are relatively young. I made eye contact with the bartenders and servers and no one came by to serve us or take our order. I absolutely hate saying this, but it felt as though they were treating us differently simply because of our race. We 'stood out' relative to the other customers. I hate jumping to conclusions but I've never felt like this before eating at a restaurant. Straight up felt racial.I am appalled and disgusted. What a way to start your morning. As a previous server, I know during peak hours it is difficult to give every customer the perfect experience. This place wasn't even half full and it was slow enough for the employees to socialize with each other and tend to new customers and the current customers except for us.If you really don't want our business, you could have just asked us to leave before even sitting down. Or if you want our money, at least pretend to be nice? Judging by how none of the servers cared, this is probably a common attitude amongst the employees. I'm all for supporting small businesses but not businesses like this. Wish there was an option for zero stars. Can't even speak for the food because they practically pushed us out the door before we could even get a water."}, {"review_id": "lhVYjy9RIXaZ5P9uuj4Gtw", "user_id": "EBozJrcKS2uiGXkIc-dUsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I'm so thankful for an incredible server/manager at The Half Door. Last weekend, we were there for brunch with a large party. Things were taking a while, they were out of menus, no one came over for quite a bit after we sat down, etc. Our large party was segmented into a few tables and all of the other tables had gotten their food but us. We waited patiently, but after an hour since ordering, we asked a waitress (who may have been a manager or owner based on her stellar customer service, and I apologize I don't know her name) for the status of our food. She went into the kitchen, came back and apologized profusely that our ticket had been dropped and they had not made our table's meal. Instead of leaving us to wait, she took great care of us, brought out a round of drinks and comped the meal. We are fans of the Half Door brunch, their bloody Mary's and breakfast potatoes. I specifically enjoy the roasted tomato Benedict which is served on English muffins. The staff did right by us and we will certainly return.

I have been to this lovely Irish pub more times than I can count (or remember). As a former frequenter of the neighborhood, this was officially our local bar. I've been here for Kegs and Eggs on St. Patrick's Day, innumerable brunches, countless trivia nights, and lots of questionable decisions have been made in the booths. Therefore, with a heavy heart, I have to say that the Half Door has slid down hill sharply in the last couple years and is no longer the best Irish bar or even the one I'd choose to go to if I were thinking of the Irish pubs in the area. The food used to be a high point and, of late, the menu has gotten sparser and the opening hours shorter. I've heard anecdotally that there's been a lot of turnover in management and staff and that seems to be to the Half Door's general detriment. TBH, it gets a full three stars rather than two due to the nostalgia factor - what used to be an awesome place to drink a beer (or many) is now slip sliding into mediocrity."}, {"review_id": "f_aGz1TX0HaRops3KlQqcQ", "user_id": "vHNu3uFjaSl7zdpngb56ig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "I love to seek out local restaurants and avoid chain AT ALL COST!

My friend brought me here for brunch. It's a cute darkly lit pub and it wasn't overly crowded which is nice. We sat ourselves down in the back booth and were greeted immediately by our waiter. We decided to split the stuffed french toast and I got the foundation meal (2 eggs any styles, bacon or sausage with hash browns) and she got this sausage andouille. Everything was delicious! Especially the french toast, it was pretty sweet but really well done and it comes with its own side of bacon . My foundation meal was good too. My eggs were a little watery for my taste, but still good. I especially loved the hash browns because it had a little spicy kick to it. Normally, I can't stand any spice but I was able to handle it.

Not the best rib I've ever had but I was pleasantly surprised. The meat was tender and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were the best part. Some of the best I have actually ever had!This is definitely a great casual pub style place to come if you're looking to have a good time.

Got the Reuben omelet which was amazing, the Russian sauce made it a little sweet but otherwise really good. Amazing home fries too. Good selection of Irish beers, also limited cocktails. The muy caliente is a warm drink but not spicy at all and actually pretty nice for a cold morning.

Both came with homefries which were good but not amazing. I did not like the seasoning as much as my wife did.I know this is most prominently a bar, and I've spent many positive happy hours or long nights there drinking, but if they are going to serve brunch then they need to realize the target audience and create more interesting and/or fulfilling choices for the price points.

It was about 2:00 on a Saturday and the place was absolutely packed! Turns out there was a wedding reception there, now that's what I call a very cool bride and groom.Anyway, we did find one table and enjoyed a very pleasant late lunch. The Yankee-Red Sox game was on TV, in fact they carried the broadcast of both teams.I started with a 22-ounce Schneider Weisse from Germany, and it was very very good. It ran $10. My lunch was a bowl of vegetarian chili ($5) and a Pub Salad ($7). My wife ordered a Classic Burger ($11).The chili was quite good. Lots of tomatoes, beans, and onions in a spicy broth, maybe it was 2/3 soup and 1/3 chili -but it was 100% enjoyable.  My salad was a big portion of dressed field greens, halved cherry tomatoes, and some really good croutons. Croutons sometimes look, feel, and taste like gravel, but believe me, these were very enjoyable.But as good as my food was, nothing was as good as the perfect French fries that covered half of my wife's hamburger plate. Think very thin, very crisp, very hot, lightly salted ribbons of peeled potato perfection. Probably the best French fries we've had in a very long time.As we were enjoying our meal, we saw the Yankees pile on more runs against the hated Red Sox, and we were entertained by a great band  -a guitar player, a bass player, and a female vocalist, they played blues style Irish songs.
