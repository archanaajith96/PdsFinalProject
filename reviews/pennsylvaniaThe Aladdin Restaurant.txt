Everything is fresh and homemade and taste absolutely yummy delicious. Our server tonight was Sam who explained everything on the menu to us she was very pleasant and helpful. We asked her who was cooking in the kitchen and she said her mother.  How mothers a fabulous cook and we didn't have room for dessert but we sure did eat it the  Homemade baklava was to die for!

The glassware sparkled, the settings were immaculate as well. Aladdin is more than a Vegan Restaurant for those who still eat meat, but the Vegan offerings are great. Vegan split Pea soup was thick, creamy, and very tasty. The House salad was crisp and very fresh with a great lemony-vinegar dressing, but the hit of the night for me was the marvelous roasted cauliflower. The service was a bit slow, but the girls worked hard, they apparently were surprised at the large turnout for this Vegan event. We will go back!"}, {"review_id": "TlXV_txUhNchCzfyBf440w", "user_id": "g0_FgtJfmHYhzw2bBETb1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/16/2017", "text": "Overall, my experience here went well. It wasn't perfect but was good. I recently took my boyfriend here for his birthday since he loves Mediterranean food, and he enjoyed everything. Starting off, our server was very good. He was polite, courteous, and extremely knowledgeable about the food, menu, and ingredients. He checked on us often but wasn't overbearing. No complaints with the service. As for the food, again, very good. We had the hummus with pita bread as an appetizer and it was truly the best hummus I've ever had. Very tasty and smooth. For my main meal I had the shrimp kabobs. The shrimp was good but tasted like they may have been over grilled a bit and were a bit dry. It came with a side of rice which paired well with it and was also very tasty. Neither of us had any dessert. I also felt like the restaurant was decorated beautifully and appeared to be a very clean and well maintained restaurant. Where I got upset was, (and the reason I'm giving four stars instead of five) is when I made reservations I made it clear it was going to be my boyfriends birthday, and asked if they could do something special for him since I really wanted to make this night nice for him. Our sever never acknowledged his birthday with a simple \"happy birthday\" or sang or anything. No body acknowledged it at all which while is minor, made me upset. I understand working in restaurants you see birthdays and anniversaries just about every day (I've worked in restaurants since I started working at 16) but a simple \"happy birthday\" is effortless and takes two seconds. Overall, I'd probably come back. The food was all very good and tasty and our waiter was awesome too. I probably won't be rushing back, but I did enjoy our visit here and regardless of them not acknowledging my boyfriends birthday, it was still a nice night and he enjoyed everything a lot too."}, {"review_id": "629ZW1ciz-uzGnpD3vm7Dg", "user_id": "Qpddd2y-_LwCpHRvqfZRzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/19/2016", "text": "Turkish coffee was terrific. Fatoush salad w olives and feta was outstanding. Falafel wrap was top notch. Pickled turnips in the falafel wrap out it well over the top of bedt I've ever had.

It was delicious and unexpected.  We started out with the pie sampler and fried cauliflower, both we enjoyed.  The variety in the pie sampler is worth going back to have again.  We each had different kabobs. The chicken and beef I had was very tasty and filling.  The rice and mushrooms as the side complimented the meat very well.  As for dessert, we tried the three available and enjoyed them all, but want to go back enjoy the date and fruit filled cookie.  We had a successful and delicious meal which we will experience again."}, {"review_id": "Kx-nnjcE3nY8lC4IHExGUg", "user_id": "VJfLKO0eXJOBxDOi_9uVBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "Food was very good!

Part of the decor were the plethora of camels placed along the restaurant which added to the atmosphere of this being a middle eastern eatery. I was also intrigued  by the lights positioned on the ceiling, giving it a starry night vibe. Giving off a semi romantic feeling. I would definitely recommend the hummus and the Turkish coffee is to die for.
