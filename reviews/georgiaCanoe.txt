We came for a date night anniversary dinner and we enjoyed everything down to the our host! The place is next to the river which is beautiful. We did reservations so we didn't wait long. Our server was amaaaazing. Very knowledgeable with food and wine. Very attentive to us. This place has been around for quite some years. Menu varies from octopus to kangaroo. I got the poached farmed egg with prosciutto ontop of sour dough and truffled celeriac purée and the duck as an entree. My husband got the crab cake and pan seared spring mountain chicken. We were definitely full. Nice setting for a date or after work drink. My Manhattan was stiff! I definitely enjoyed my time and the warm welcome here! A place to come back and see what else is offered."}, {"review_id": "w3SwTQ1sszwwPkztv-YQaQ", "user_id": "QZt1To_FRcxYhoMoBkWn-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Outstanding wait staff. Beautiful restaurant. Food was amazing. Can't wait to go back. Uhhh. Went back for brunch. Not my favorite. I got the French toast. It was very tasty. ALittle too sweet. I ordered a side of potatoes. So did my son. My husband ordered bacon and cheese grits. She put all 4 sides together on one plate. Not cool. Also, she wasn't very cheerful. IF I go back, I'll request to sit on the porch. So loud by the kitchen. . 2 stars."}, {"review_id": "vKAnW1Z4A2snhVTqNqvyig", "user_id": "VAO4bl4ldKHQVrHbVSYQZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Visited Canoe with my husband for our anniversary dinner.

I would say is like the \"little black dress\" of restaurants as it fits several boxes that people may be looking for.It's a romantic place with a beautiful view of the river and a garden to sit and get a drink, the mix of people went from casual to business casual dress code.The service is amazing! The food was delicious.  We had the jumbo crab cake for appetizer, the entrees were the duck breast and the pappardelle pasta, and for dessert the strawberry shortcake.  I wouldn't be able to pick my favorite.  This is a place that we'll definitely be back, once the weather is warmer and we can sit outside for an appetizer and a drink."}, {"review_id": "OJ-oRENa4RKEyQluw3Inbw", "user_id": "2RFyJnbJ5AHT9hQp_tMeYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "One of my favorite places in Atlanta. I've eaten here twice, once for lunch and another time for brunch. You want to go here when there is nice weather because the deck and green space is just amazing.My sister and I ordered the specials and ate some delicious food.Brunch began with a small basket of scones and sticky buns! We received four different pastries and split all of them three ways (essentially a pastry and 1/3rd each). I could have eaten a million more of the scones, but I had to save room for my delicious steak and eggs.I ordered Steak and Eggs with Potato Hash while mom ordered the Crispy Shrimp Salad with Napa Cabbage Slaw, Sweet Pepper Remoulade. Ally devoured her meal before I could grab a photo, but she ate a delicious pork belly with grits and Asian salad."}, {"review_id": "ilmcMz60J26gUF4WVhJM9w", "user_id": "WN9eL-1SQljcrzH9i8mEAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Environment/location: This place is consistently amazing!I went for the first time about ~3 years ago and had a phenomenal experience. Years later I returned and it was just as great from what I can recall. This restaurant is somewhat situated in the cut, but surrounded by beautiful greenery and great views from the windows.Food: I had the Red Wine Braised Australian Lamb Shank for my entreé (I'm not a fan of polenta so I switched it out for mashed potatoes instead) and the Popcorn Ice Cream Sundae for dessert. The lamb was so tender and the sauce was perfect. The mashed potatoes were delicious and had a nice cracked black pepper flavor which I really love. The Popcorn sundae was a sweet, cool finish to the meal and the Canoe's Cracker Jack they garnish it with was so addictive!Service: The service was impeccable and everyone was very polite and helpful."}, {"review_id": "BhR7ySaqAypEiM1lA8RbVA", "user_id": "x7oHcLEotxJUDrlBjcMGrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "I can't say enough good things about Canoe! The service is excellent. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu and he also provided great recommendations! I came here to celebrate my birthday and I felt like a Queen! We started off with the crispy Australian octopus which was very tender and not chewy. For my entree I got the pork trio and each cut of pork was cooked to perfection, my personal favorite was the pork tenderloin. I also got to try the basil crusted cod which was also delicious.Now for the best part of any meal..DESSERT! I got the chocolate grotto, which was customized for my birthday! I am a chocolate lover but the chocolate grotto was a little too rich for my taste. My favorite dessert was the popcorn sundae. It was so unique and had house made cracker jacks. Yum!Hey fam!

I had never been before, but it seemed to be quite a popular place as far as I could tell. I was very excited & did some (a lot of) research before the day of the reservation. The exterior was surprising, as I imagined it'd be a free standing restaurant. They offered a valet, although their parking lot, from what I could tell, was more than walkable.  Anyway, the exterior was tastefully decorated with fall trimmings. We were quickly seated by a nice hostess & soon greeted by our waiter. I remember the service was wonderful. Everything we had questions about were answered. We ordered mostly their specials, so I don't remember the exact names, & I can't look at the menu for reference (rookie mistake). They also had a waiter bring breads over, which was nice. Bread is my favorite thing. I probably annoyed him taking photos.We ordered two cocktails, scotch eggs (quail eggs) for the appetizer, I ordered the special which was bolognese, for my entree. I also tried the rabbit which I liked more than the special bolognese. Both dishes were great, however. We ended up sharing them! The restaurant was very dimly lit & would be great for a romantic dinner. I don't expect to be back except in case of special occasions, as I feel it's well suited & well known for being that type of restaurant!Anyway, I had a great birthday dinner here & I suggest it if you're looking for a B-day dinner location!"}, {"review_id": "xsNRXWtwg-MYgdBuOFxDsA", "user_id": "z3GKno925T4mTiPdbyYwng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Great birthday lunch.

We arrived a little earlier than our reservation time and sat near the hostess stand for a few minutes. The restaurant is very beautiful and the atmosphere was romantic. Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu and provided great service. We were offered different types of bread at the beginning of our meal. I had a cocktail that was delicious, but was on the smaller side for the price. We ordered the wood grilled New York strip and the red wine braised Australian lamb shank. The lamb was very tender, but lacked flavor. The root vegetables and polenta that accompanied it were both good. I ordered it because the waiter said that it was one of his favorite dishes, but I definitely should've chose another entree. My bf enjoyed his steak though.Overall, I liked it, I just didn't love it. This is a special occasion restaurant and honestly, I wasn't thrilled with the food. I do plan on returning for brunch soon. From what I hear, their brunch is awesome."}, {"review_id": "3Vm515zONKfJobkGbITx8w", "user_id": "KpLWwQoqEk1bQPDbZfn4NA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Obviously the location is gorgeous, but the restaurant itself is truly remarkable.The service was impeccable, our waiter, Scott, was prompt, polite, knowledgeable, and charismatic, we always had everything we needed and more. The food was to die for. We started with the scones and she crab soup, both of which were by far the best we'd ever had, which is no easy feat. For the main course my fiancé had (if I recall correctly) a duck burger and fries, which he loved. Unfortunately, my dish was the one underwhelming aspect of the experience. I ordered the fried tomato benedict. The fried tomato was little heavy on the batter which was admittedly tough and chewy, and the tomato itself was very mild and lacking the expected tartness. The eggs were poached perfectly, but the (pimento?) hollandaise, like the tomato, was extremely under-seasoned and tasted a bit off, not bad, just... maybe unbalanced? I'm not a picky person, but I thought maybe it was a personal taste issue, so I had my fiancé try it as well. In this case he strongly agreed and wouldn't take another bite. I feel they had a good concept here, the execution was just off. Maybe with a slightly riper tomato, less batter, more seasoning, and more acid to balance the pimento in the hollandaise? Well, after the main course the superb service continued and our waiter was kind enough to offer us a smaller portion of the caramel popcorn sundae as we were dying to try it but could barely manage another bite. It of course was amazing. The popcorn was perfectly crunchy and addictive, the ice cream thick and creamy with a lightly sweet flavor similar to corn pops. Overall we were very pleased and hope to be back again."}, {"review_id": "3ZA4JuLd-hYYF7DGDLmP2Q", "user_id": "-e8Eb1uB-356QlaU4WLL0A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The atmosphere here is amazing!

But I did enjoy the experience that everyone loves. The service was impeccable and our server made our evening even more delightful. Everything we ate was perfect.

But, when you make that left there is another sign that says valet only. I was so confused I just had my car valet. I just didn't want to be lazy, as the parking lot really is not that big and valeting your car seems unnecessary. Valet is complimentary, but of course if you grew up with any type of manners you would tip. When you walk in the ambience is very warm and welcoming. Everything is wood from the floor to the ceiling. It has this cabin feeling to it, which I love. Got here a little later than I would have liked, around 9pm. It did feel a little rushed. For appetizers we had the Australian Octopus ($16) and the Smoked Salmon ($14). Both EXTREMELY flavorful, honestly everything here was full of flavor. The appetizers to me seemed more of a bigger portion than the entrees. For entrees we ordered the Sichuan Dusted Duck ($32) and the Veal Ribeye Au Poivre ($37). Honestly it seemed that anything that you order you cannot go wrong with. I really wanted to try the rabbit l, but the portion sized looked so small. But like I said the appetizers are pretty big and I felt that because the food was so flavorful it seemed to get you fuller quicker. Also the bread is complimentary and you can have as much as you want, but who really wants or needs that many carbs... they know this, that's probably why is is complimentary.I definitely recommend this place and I will definitely be back for the rabbit, \"I'll get you wabbit.\" (Elmer Fudge voice) The next time I come back though it probably won't be so late so it doesn't feel rushed."}, {"review_id": "ypeIJoD53O-8knh1PGXT5Q", "user_id": "q9ZcCR6U3eaclJ737z4DAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "The ambiance is great.

Food was on point, service was excellent. We always had a great experience but not living in the area anymore we haven't made the trek here in a while. My husband wanted to make the night wonderful. He made reservations request a cake with happy anniversary on it when he called in the reservations. When we got here we noticed a lot of things have changed. I remembered back then it was mostly business casual dress but now shorts and T-shirt's are acceptable. The hostess were really nice - one thing positive. Even though we were 15 minutes late they were accommodating and pleasant about it. The menu is not longer a book type menu but a one page maybe 10 items on it. Basically appetizers and main meals. They no longer put a basket of bread on the table. They bring the basket and ask you which piece you want. At least Olive Garden they leave the basket.We ordered main meals and drinks. Our food came out very quick! Even before the drinks hit the table. I thought that was unusual but realized why. My chicken was room temperature and dry. Not to mention salty skin. It wasn't even luke warm it was room temperature chicken. I'll be surprised if I don't get a stomach ache. I ended up taking a few bites and leaving the rest.We never got the cake my husband requested and when asked about it the server said it she said request aren't \"guaranteed\". If that's the case they should probably let someone in front know to not take them at all. She ended up bringing something complimentary. But that's not the issue, we have no problem paying for a cake that was requested. She made it seem like we just wanted a freebie. I didn't even know we were getting something until my husband told me he requested it over the phone. Overall it was very disappointing. I wouldn't waste gas coming here again and I don't understand why the reviews here are so great."}, {"review_id": "rPTSPoAG48anWWWa-VVoww", "user_id": "qEif0qFyCGy1iESkJdW9qA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I had a wonderful experience last night at Canoe. I chose Canoe as the place to spend my birthday. My party was fairly large and we were the last table for our server Bryan. Most times when this happens I feel as though servers are less accommodating and I get the shorter end of the stick when it comes to great service. However, Bryan made our experience absolutely memorable! For our appetizers we ordered: Calamari, Crab Cake, Smoked Salmon and the Charcuterie Plate. There wasn't a single appetizer that was short of amazing. For my entree, I enjoyed the Lamb Shank. The meat was so tender it fell off the bone beautifully. Bryan topped my experience off with the Popcorn Ice Cream Sunday. Such a perfect combination of sweet and salty! The service was absolutely 5 star! Thank you Bryan and Canoe.
