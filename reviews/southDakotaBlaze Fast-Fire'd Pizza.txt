I like the approach of customizing pizza up front and having it prepared in front of me; I think my biggest concern is the ingredients just... seem cheap. Biggest issues- (1) The dough doesn't rise like I've seen in higher quality pizzas or taste as good; (2) the sauce seems of Chef Boyardee (which, hey... I grew up on Beefaroni) quality. In defense of Blaze, I think that's all they want to be, which is okay and I will definitely be coming back for it. It's not the best, but that's fine."}, {"review_id": "by9ofitcWL5drIpKP5gitw", "user_id": "jIdy2-74XDPSwYoUEfjniA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "Man, this place is delicious!!!  Great quality product and service.  I did a \"build you own\", and had many fresh, delicious, and healthy choices to choose from!  So good, that while we were eating, I was looking up their other locations to see if there was one back home in CO.  Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "KWfLzxoT8VxB1otMgrrq1Q", "user_id": "DHsxat34lta9rE7PenVacw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "We were amazed at how quickly the whole process is.  The workers are very efficient and super nice.  Great variety of pizzas and once you order one of the signature pizzas you can add as many toppings as you want for no extra cost.  We got the Meat Eater, Green Stripe, and Red Vine.  The fresh mozzarella on the Red Vine was amazing.  The pesto on the Green Stripe was delicious.  We downloaded the app and plan to come back many more times.  This place was great!!"}, {"review_id": "O-RQgkzvqkgEShC1-mK93w", "user_id": "n971SX5FYTw3Vy7z5Bm9pA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/4/2017", "text": "I ate here this afternoon after driving in from the badlands on our way to the black hills.  I'm from Minnesota and am used to Punch Pizza which I thought would be similar.  It was for the most part but I would say punch would come out on top, but that doesn't mean that this was bad, the customer service was very good and the food was good as well.  The pizza was good it just lacked the flavors that it could have been talked advantage of with some more ingredients.

If you want to add bacon or peppers or another topping, if you want the pizza to be half this and half that, they do it for you with no hassle. I got the barbecue chicken pizza, and my two friends with me ordered their own customized pizzas.The pizza really does take only 3 minutes (as they market it, 180 seconds). It's a thin-crust pizza--if you like that kind of thing, great. If you like thicker crust, you won't find it here.They don't have many options beyond pizza, so if you're hungry for something else, this might not be the place either.If you want a good-quality pizza made the way you want in a short amount of time, Blaze is a great option."}, {"review_id": "8INpxYUSW56WcKq9GMv5VQ", "user_id": "VK5qHARulYLQ8A2YR-mHWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/7/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The crew tonight was great. Polite, friendly, and lots of smiles. Fun place to eat, not to mention the pizza is EXCELLENT!The crust is perfect, then you select everything from what type of sauce to what type of garlic.

There's always a friendly crew, which of course makes the dining experience all that much more pleasant. B-I just took away their A+++ because today I made a small suggestion to the Mgr. He seemed impositioned. If he feels above reproach, then the place will never improve."}, {"review_id": "ltDtHTIGrOYr2VZRsQljyA", "user_id": "iqGYqsa8nx4pRY7Da7ijvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/2/2016", "text": "Excellent pizza.
