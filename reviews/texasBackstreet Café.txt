The food was great, the service was even better, and the patio setting was perfect for a nice cool Sunday afternoon! I enjoy everything! I ordered the shrimp and grits! Others at my table ordered the Migas, the Oxtail dish, and a special they had that day with the brisket. The food was fantastic all around! I will definitely be returning!"}, {"review_id": "mVgBP1YC7IhrrX_5RLlzaQ", "user_id": "gdD2ZFRrh5D8B5PNKCJbbA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "We came to Backstreet for my sister-in-law's birthday brunch.  We were in Houston for girls weekend. Food was great.  Presentation was nice.  Server was friendly.  However, my credit card was charged for double the amount of the cost.  4 ladies, split the bill 3 ways to pay for SIL. One of us paid $72 in cash. My friend and I paid $72 each on credit. I specifically wrote $0 on tip line when signing for payment because the cash payment would have covered the tip. We added 20% to the total for tip before splitting it 3 ways. J was charged $72. P paid $72 in cash and I was charged $144, even though I know I wrote $0 tip on the line and $72 total. Earlier I had noticed that we were overcharged for Sangria on the tab and had pointed it out to her. She corrected it. So I called the manager and he looked up the transaction. He said we paid $24 in cash and J paid $72 on credit and the server had put $72 for food and $72 for tip on mine. Ummm, no.He refunded my $72, hopefully. I'll look at my credit card statement in 2-3 business days. I don't know. Argh. The manager apologized for the \"misunderstanding and inconvenience\" but I don't know.  It definitely ruined the experience.  I'm just glad I looked at my statement!  I would expect a better resolution to this for being a higher end and James Beard award restaurant. We were at Xochi 2 days before and feel that we spent a lot of money in these restaurants while visiting Houston."}, {"review_id": "rT1FsGwiyY0ycMHpGjYc8w", "user_id": "jmIM-Qf1cgcL4wYhHNh-PQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I've been wanting to try Backstreet Cafe since moving to Houston back in July 2016. I should slap myself for waiting almost two years to finally go!! All the hype around this place is SO well deserved. I ordered the fried chicken and biscuits (pictured) and let's just say I would rate it a 12 out of 10. The fried chicken was really flavorful and the creamy jalapeño sauce on top brought the entire dish together. The crab cakes here are also some of the best I've had in Houston so far. I came with a party of 11 during peak brunch hours but the service was still exceptional. The staff was really accommodating to our rowdy group of friends and went out of their way to make sure we had a great experience. I will finish in the wise words of Drake by saying I will be going BACK TO BACKKK to Backstreet Cafe."}, {"review_id": "FUfwCliNRni0TMs8-t8a9Q", "user_id": "4ZbCVQZAbW3Reg-xw9Nxag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "This review does not apply to their regular food since I was here for a wedding. This place is such a lovely location as a wedding venue. My friend had the ceremony outdoor in the courtyard and she reserved the whole upper floor for her reception. In addition to the Hors D'oeuvres, we had a 3-course meal starting with a light pear salad, followed with an appetizing chicken soup and an entree of either short ribs or salmon.  Every course came in beautiful placement and the food were delicious. All the staff were very polite and highly attentive. Strongly recommend this place for weddings of 50-60 people!"}, {"review_id": "-TZwtkPK_WgnLk7O0w3X1Q", "user_id": "1bSo9vqRaZnl1mwsoZJP5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "I came here for a group dinner over the holidays, and Backstreet still holds it down. In our group of 10 people, there wasn't a bad dish among us. Their menu isn't cutting edge, but it's not stodgy either. It can feel a bit unfocused; the dishes are a mix of New American, Italian, and Southern, with a few Asian nods. However, it's all approachable comfort food done elegantly.We did quite a few appetizers; the crab cakes and beignets stuck out to me. I had the bucatini with spicy crab, which had generous crab and restrained spice dressed simply with lemon and garlic and elevated with some crunch. Dessert was also great-- a kind of butterscotch cake.The bill can add up for a big group, but most entrees are in the twenties and appetizers are not too bad. Wine prices are all over the map but there are some cheap by-the-glass options. Cocktails seemed a touch pricy for Houston.Service remains excellent and the converted townhouse setting is charming. Parking is valet. Reserve if possible. I like this a little better for brunch, but always reliable for a nice but not overly extravagant dinner."}, {"review_id": "a6f49FRUqFvIf1TKFZZegA", "user_id": "PV7tpHc6WnKl6Cj5unpd7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "It was cool spot.  I hear Sunday brunch is the best though.  We went for lunch on a weekday; so we didn't get a chance to try the brunch menu. Okay so it's valet parking, and maybe a few spots on the street. But I recommend going ahead and valet. You can can tell the restaurant is older because of the height of the ceiling. But it has so much charm. Our waiter was very nice and the food was pretty good.

It wasn't sweet, but more of a sour thin taste. I could taste the tea, but it was just a strange mix. It was missing some sweetness. CRAB CAKES & EGGS- red pepper beurre blancI really liked the crab cake. There was plenty of crab and it was sweet and fresh. The red pepper beurre blanc added another layer of creamy sweetness to the dish as well. I only wish there was more than just one stack of crab cake. The eggs were poached perfectly and were so runny and creamy.I really love grabbing brunch here. Food is always good and the ambiance is pretty chill. I'm sure I'll be back soon."}, {"review_id": "teE1kD85dx5mgR7zw3x3BA", "user_id": "3RTesI_MAwct13LWm4rhLw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "This cafe has definitely an upper class ambience and crowd.  I came here with my sisters and boyfriend for brunch and surprisingly for a Sunday we were seated right away!  There is definitely limited seating indoors but we were seated in their large outdoor covered patio which was quite nice. Our waiter was professional but didn't give us the service we expected, not sure if it was because we were dressed down in comfortable workout clothing. I did like the fact that they gave our table complimentary sweets to snack on. The scone was delicious but a little too crunchy and on the slightly drier side. The mini muffins were soft and quite delightful!I ordered the salmon and eggs which the salmon came out perfectly. I however wasn't a fan of the potato cakes as I was expecting something on the crunch side to add contrast to the soft textures from the salmon and eggs. The egg and hollandaise sauce should have been put off to the side rather than on top of the potato cakes; my sister agreed as well as we both had the same dish. I tried my sisters crab cake and it was extremely flavorful and tasty! I was craving another bite of it. Prices are on the higher end as dishes ran between $15-$26."}, {"review_id": "DUxOxCvPNhyBpvNKa9bTVw", "user_id": "XE9oN0yuY30MsPCJb9dBNw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "I am now a MAJOR fan of Backstreet Cafe and can not wait to come back. The first time I visited, they were only taking reservations so we weren't able to be seated, so glad that wasn't the case when I came back this Saturday.We were seated right away inside, we weren't given the option of sitting outside, this is one reason that five starts weren't given. Once we were seated, it didn't take long for our waitress to come by and take our drink order. I got the wild berry mimosa and my bf got the pomegranate mimosa. They were both amazing, although, the pomegranate reminded me a bit of grape fruit. A very pleasant surprise, they serve light pastries before the meal comes out, perfect to hold you over while you wait. I ordered the smoked chicken and potato hash...it was phenomenal. The chicken was perfectly seasoned with Spanish spices and you can taste the time they took to make sure this bird was cooked to perfection. I had my eggs over-hard (my go to) and it worked perfectly when creating a taco with the tortilla that was given. The avocados were very fresh, no browning at all (you'd be surprised how often this happens). The tomatillo sauce was great, but has no spice, so I ordered a side of jalapenos and it gave the dish a much needed kick (I like it spicy).My bf got the chicken and biscuits and piratically finished it before I could ask for a bite, and after I tried it, I could see why. Another chicken dish seasoned the way only a true chef can season. The chicken wasn't fried too hard, something else that is a big plus.**My plate didnt photograph very well, but my bf's did and the bottle the mimosa comes in makes for great photos**Why didn't I give five stars? 1. The waitress took a very long time to come back to our table, we were there for almost two hours, a majority of the time was spent waiting on our waitress to come back to the table2. We weren't given a seating option3. There were crumbs on my place setting when I first arrivedOverall, I would for sure come back and recommend Backstreet to all :)Enjoy!Food Insta: @_yougonnaeatthat"}, {"review_id": "VKkklj8cS5wevTsIc4EbpQ", "user_id": "OPSgzQ3vuAhh3vcMIzuiNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "One of the best brunch places in Houston!

Food: I ordered the Fungi Pasta ($20 vegetarian style). I was starving and so excited to eat. When the food came, it was SUCH a small portion for the price. Only a fist size of pasta was on the plate and with no protein, it's not enough to fill anyone up. The pasta itself was very good; however I was left hungry after eating (keep in mind I barely am able to finish half of my plate at other restaurants). Service: The waitstaff was accommodating, patient with our large group, and very attentive. Ambience: Backstreet Cafe is a great for a nicer meal with a cute patio that's perfect for warm Houston days. Overall: The service and ambience was great but with the measly portion of food for the price, I probably wouldn't go here again unless it was for drinks or an occasion."}, {"review_id": "iBKboaikBG-qxYv2MXgLMw", "user_id": "WKpYsrfPiKfzq0h8IAodVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Backstreet Cafe is a romantic Houston favorite.

The food was amazinggggggg!! Like omggg! and the service was excellent. Our waiter was so nice and told us the specials for the day and was so patient with me and my party.The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because the parking is such a pain. I had to park in a garage near there, but I guess that is River Oaks area for you. The other reason is because this restaurant is DEFINITELY on the pricier side. The food is pretty amazing though.
