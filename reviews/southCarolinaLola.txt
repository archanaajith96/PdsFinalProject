I have been looking for good fried gator in the tricounty area and I finally found it in Lola located in park circle! And BONUS- their outside area is pet friendly!! We ordered the duck fries as an appetizer and loved them!! As you can see it is the only picture we managed to take because we were so excited about our gator entree we didn't have time to take a picture before indulging. The only down side to Lola is it's size. Unfortunately were a group of eight and also had a pup with us so we needed to sit outside. It was a busy Friday evening so we had to wait a bit for a large table to accommodate but once the wait for a table was over, the rest of the experience was great."}, {"review_id": "qFJmXrUk1N2udOSqjoXBjw", "user_id": "beVixHLibJYSKvX1yiXrhg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Visited this past weekend.  Owner is super friendly and our server was great.  The food unfortunately wasn't that great.  We all ordered fried food.  I had the catfish platter, my son ordered the gator bites, and my daughter in law ordered the shrimp poboy.  My daughter law and I could tell the seafood was fresh however there was a greasy like aftertaste, almost as if the oil used for frying needed to be changed.  The restaurant is small, with a few booths and high top tables inside. There is also a bar / bar seating. Outside there are additional tables for seating. I will definitely give this restaurant another try as our issues appeared to be related to the oil which impacted the taste our food."}, {"review_id": "rzMZP2FMEa5qiMawcJSO2w", "user_id": "4dQctQT3OUWn3fl7dD2OkQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "This place is amazing.

Happily, we've got Lola's in Park Circle. It was my first time eating their food but I'll definitely be back. I got the Gator Bites Basket at lunch, which comes with seasoned (very mildly spiced) fries and a Honey Jalapeño Cornbread. I've had gator a few times when I lived relatively close to the Everglades so that's my point of comparison. The Gator Bites were plentiful. I was only able to eat half and saved the other half for later. The Bites were fried and deliciously seasoned. Compared to the Glades gator, I found this one to be really chewy, similar to fried clams. I wasn't thrilled with that texture but the taste was so good I got over that point pretty quickly. The Bites weren't spicy at all. I assumed they would be being from a Cajun resto, but nonetheless they were great. The fry was on point; crisp and crunchy not greasy and soggy. The slightly sweet remoulade (mayo based sauce with pieces of pickles) was so good. I used it on the bites, the fries, and cleaned up what was left with the pieces of lettuce! Forgo the ketchup and ask for extra remoulade sauce! The Creole fries were tasty. These did have a kick and were also not greasy, which is definitely a plus,  but I prefer my fries on the crispy side and these were pretty soft. I was slightly disappointed with the cornbread. Although the taste was good I just found it way too dry and crumbly. The staff was busy but they were all friendly and helpful. While waiting for my food, I noticed they all seemed to be helping each other out to take care of customers as quickly as possible. Overall vibe of the resto was very laidback. My table neighbors' plates looked so delicious I made a mental note to order everything they got next time around."}, {"review_id": "oHeUrxr2zSKRfnBkQutr6w", "user_id": "nwwyskuUFnqAHjb35FtnWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Any place that has a food truck as the kitchen has got my attention. I went with the Captain's Platter and ordered gator bites with crawfish. I fully enjoyed both and they paired well with their respective sauces. The menu at the door needs updating, but it was a difference of a couple dollars. The waitstaff and owner were very cordial. If pressed for a negative I would say that they're too popular and could expand the dining area."}, {"review_id": "EbUAydoFfGEhqpCl-CB5yg", "user_id": "mIgLAWjGCvDBp9pKhV4WDQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "The waitress was very friendly & attentive. The restaurant had outdoor seating & indoor seating. It was a little noisy inside with customers watching television & dogs barking at the restaurant (dogs are allowed on site.) I ordered the shrimp and andouille sausage macaroni & cheese. Pepper jack cheese was used & it was really good and creamy. The sausage had a little kick to it. The portion size appeared to be small but it was just enough for me. The hurricane was on the happy hour menu & was really good. For desert I ordered the pecan pie sweet potato pie. It was good however I tasted more of the pecan pie than sweet potato. I tasted a piece of the fried alligator & the fried crawfish. They both were good."}, {"review_id": "tCQYMDMpzc3to3LEuXSDFQ", "user_id": "M5Vd9AQtBldU6zNhH1EyKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Went here for lunch with the family on a Saturday afternoon around 1-2pm.

She even brought out a water bowl for my puppy. We ordered the gator bites to start, which were delicious.

Charleston and didn't want to have to go all the way into town. I'm so glad I found this local neighborhood place on Yelp and the reviews are spot on. It's family owned, very relaxed/casual place to hang out. There is a small outside patio and the bar open up to it (garage door style) and about 10 seats at the bar. It's a small quaint place so it'll get packed fast. I sat at the bar and everyone was so nice. There is a happy hour full of Abita beers and so many great choices. I settled on a full entree - Gumbo and it as SO GOOD and huge portion. The corn bread was spot on too! I can't wait to come back.

Our server was a really nice guy and gave us great recommendations. We ordered some gator bites and some gumbo-style fries, and those were AWESOME. Definitely get the gator bites. I had the Cajun burger, and my husband ordered gumbo with a red sauce base. The burger was awesome, and my husband thought his food was pretty good (not super impressed though). He did, however, say that the cornbread was the best he had ever had (and we're from Alabama!!).Overall it was a really good experience, and we loved the environment. There was also parking right next to the restaurant, and that was definitely a plus.

Doesn't make me a Cajun food expert, but it does mean I know the real deal when it is put in front of me, and NOLA is the real deal. I was with a group from work and we all ordered something different so we could have a little mini-buffet and every single thing was top notch. Good beer selection helps, including some local brews. The only thing keeping the 5th star away is the price, so be prepared that lunch will run you $25 unless you really skimp on the apps and entries and dodge out on water.
