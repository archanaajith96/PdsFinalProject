We made reservations on a Tuesday evening but it certainly wasn't necessary.  Sarah was our server and she was wonderful and suffered our conversation Sarah told us it was happy hour so instead of ordering dinner (we had gotten an appetizer at Ruby House and you can read that review, boo) we ordered the braised buffalo rib. That's right, one rib and it's delicious! We ended up ordering two ribs since one was only $3!  I wasn't able to finish the one but hubby was happy about that. He got a side of peanut sauce with his rib but I wasn't a fan.Oh and a bottle of The Show Malbec  We also ordered a side of mushrooms which are absolutely fabulous! I should have ordered two since u didn't want to share!If we are ever in this area again this would be a definite stop!"}, {"review_id": "ofKFQWkGrRfFlQA_g_EjXQ", "user_id": "WHGjqjqBFXkFyF8UjXwP8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "When you say that you want to go to the most stereotypical western steakhouse imaginable in Rapid City, Dakotah Steakhouse is your place. I'm originally from the Front Range of Colorado, so I have been to more than my fair share of western steakhouse, and Dakotah really does a great job of living and breathing western hospitality and great food.The food is reliably good to amazing. I have had some less than excellent selections, but on the whole the steak is always spot on. I generally order the Prime Ribeye by the ounce, so I can get just the amount of meat that I want. The meat is always flavorful, well marbled, juicy, and tender. They serve it with plenty of au jus and horseradish for those who are so inclined.The sides are pretty good. I would warn against getting the fried mac and cheese, which doesn't live up to its name. Instead I would wholeheartedly recommend the bacon-wrapped asparagus, which does live up to its name.The décor is exactly what you want, raw wood structures with big plush leather chairs and a roaring fire. It makes for a comfortable atmosphere with spectacular food.There aren't many restaurants that I hit every time I'm in Rapid, but Dakotah Steakhouse has easily made that list."}, {"review_id": "FQgr3cM53TKqy0EEln49vA", "user_id": "XyznDDP2d8npdX5TaPvpGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "We were traveling through and just wanted a nice delicious meal. The building is beautiful and very versatile seating for a date night or a big family meal. Rustic style and plenty of parking. Our service was good but, I struggled most with the timing. We had made reservations on a Friday night and still we were seated but we waited a long time for the initial greet from our server and our food courses took a very long time. It was a bit painful and a lot longer meal than we were hoping for. Our server did explain and apologize that a very large table had gotten their orders in right before ours. My husband got a burger and I got a steak. My steak was minimally warm so I imagine it was sitting for a bit. This was a let down. The cook was perfection though and I do appreciate that. I got the mushroom bread pudding and it was so dry. I would not recommend it. In the area I think this is a nice place for a meal. We even tried their sage ice cream which was very unique! It was a nice meal indeed. Salad was fresh and the fry bread with butter was delicious. The menu is more geared toward South Dakota wild fare which is great. I wish more of the wines were represented better of South Dakota. They had a lot of Napa and California wines. We left full and our bill was around $100 without a tip"}, {"review_id": "IVD4WwPO1815FhMuKbgVxA", "user_id": "7zUokRjUO4-aPN8fht6O1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "Came here for the first time and was pleasantly impressed.

I was seated right away with no wait.I came here to dinner alone and was seated at a cute little one person booth. The server was attentive and my water glass was full the whole time. No complaints here. I ordered the steakhouse onion rings, the sirloin steak (with house salad and fried mac and cheese as my side). All guests received a complimentary fried bread.Fried bread: I think this was a new thing? I remembered it being baked bread from the last time I was here. The fried bread was meh. Very greasy and heavy. I had one bit and stopped.The steakhouse onion rings came out hot and crispy. It's thick cut white onion. I'm a fan in white onion as it's less sweet compared to yellow onion. The onion rings were fried to perfection and to my surprise they gave you quite a large portion for the price. The presentation of the onion rings was definitely attention-drawing. The chipotle aioli sauce was a nice complement to the deep friend onion rings.The house salad was not fresh. I forgot to take a picture. I peaked at other people's house salad and I saw that the freshness of the salad seemed to be a hit or miss. Some plates have fresh salad greens, some plates don't. I was one of the unfortunate ones.The sirloin steak was cooked to perfection. I ordered in medium, nice seat on the outside and perfect center pink. All steaks come with sauce and fried onions. Honestly, I could do without the fried onions. Fried mac and cheese was TO DIE FOR. I love the fried mac and cheese here. Please, if you come here, order fried mac and cheese as your side. Side note, I got the satay skewers multiple times and that was nice too. I would come back here again if I want steaks. In fact, I come here every time I'm in Rapid City. Compared to Delmonico's grill in downtown, this is more of a down-to-earth, ranch style restaurant."}, {"review_id": "lxMawVneQ1rRHuXlTOjcaQ", "user_id": "T7Nhxux5ao3Bk7ItFhpuig", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/24/2017", "text": "Decided to give Dakotah's a try since I was staying at the Residence Inn.

It didn't take long to be seated. It took awhile to be greeted by our server though. We placed our drink order and since we were ready went ahead and gave her our whole order.

A few years ago this was our favorite restaurant in Rapid...now?Over cooked burgers and steak (medium rare was medium well, if not just well done)The server didn't come to check until after what had to be 20 minutes, when (we were so hungry and having waited) eventually ate our food leaving just a few pieces to show him our disappointment. The manager \"could not do anything\" about it. They also could not apply any of our previous points because we didn't physically have the card. That was not the case every other time we have come.If you're looking for a good steak, go to Delmonicos downtown (or Alpine Inn in Hill City). This is one of the most expensive restaurants in the Black Hills and the quality unfortunately plummeted from when we were here last.

We were ages 10-71 in our party and the menu had something for everyone. Downsides - the prices are steep ($40 steaks) and when one steak wasn't cooked right (which was brought up very politely) the very young server began arguing and looked very obviously annoyed. At the prices people are paying, their staff should be more amenable with issues.

What a brightly flavored fish! It's similar to tilapia in terms of mildness but a fresher taste. Apparently it's a local food and is the state fish of South Dakota. I happened to visit when fried walleye was a special dinner pricing, which came with bacon wrapped asparagus. It was decent, though I've had better elsewhere. I also ordered the pheasant poppers, and they were good mainly because of the cheese. I wish there had been more pheasant inside as it was hard to tell there was meat inside. Pheasant is the state bird of South Dakota. The beef, vegetable, and rotini soup was not good. It's very oily. I realize that the soup is supposed to be brothy, but there's a difference between broth and oil blobs floating to the surface of your soup.I question the authenticity of the kuchen, hence the three stars. According to a travel website, it's supposed to be a pastry with custard inside but instead a flan on top of a pastry circle is served. Is this authentic? Maybe it's supposed to be the chef's newfangled interpretation of the dessert, but as a restaurant who boasts all things South Dakotan, I wish they would just stick to tradition!"}, {"review_id": "xpY-s_WxMCnmyqja2usaNQ", "user_id": "m9XA59WFBHSrjEmJZOcLqQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/11/2017", "text": "I looked on Yelp for a place close by, but the map said they were closed.
