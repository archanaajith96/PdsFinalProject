And with the suggestions from some of my fellow Yelpers how responded to my question, \"What are some of the best bakeries in Jax?\" I decided to visit Biscottis for dessert and an evening cup of coffee. Upon arrival, the cafe felt very welcoming and cozy. My friend and opted for bar seating and ended up with the best server ever - totally forgot his name. He gave us some great suggestions on desserts to try. I went for the Anniversary Cake and my friend went for the Oreo Crusted Chocolate Cheesecake. #Yummy and #Rich but delicious! I paired my dessert with a Vanilla Latte and  friend opted for a regular cafe con leche (coffee with cream). Both cups of coffee was bigger than what we expected to receive and I must say, my latte was beyond my expectation of delicious! And that Anniversary cake - a slice of Heaven in my mouth!"}, {"review_id": "x7HMn7I_AlP_V27Xmx_bog", "user_id": "xpiEaGco-NokoTsmi3Y6rg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite places to eat big and enjoy the taste of great cooking. This is a place where you don't share your food with family and friends...you just eat your own meal.However, I was surprised that my salmon BLT wasn't the same as usual for whatever reason (hence the reason for four stars). So, I had to send it back and go with a juicy hamburger with pasta salad and sun died tomatoes. It was very tasty and good. I always saved the best for last at this place, desserts. I had the same as usual the bread pudding. It's probably the best dessert place in Jacksonville, FL. I think they beat out French Pantry on a few items. In my opinion, I am humble to say!

Every time we go, the food is absolutely fantastic. The cakes are to die for, and the staff is more than happy to take you on the \"cake tour\" and let you know what every slice is. We also suggest the signature fries, Ortega pizza, and baked Brie. The only thing I have qualms about is that sometimes it takes a good amount of time for the wait staff to get to your table once you arrive and are seated. However, the most recent time we went to Biscotti's, this was not a problem.All in all, 10/10, this is one of the best places in the city."}, {"review_id": "iYnYLn_W1m-AAI65MsRr9g", "user_id": "IHLHxc548GQgBmOm0V-30g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I have to start with WOW! We arrived for breakfast the hostess informed us they usually take reservations but she found us a table that was available. To start I ordered a Mimosa that was basically perfect.

I had the Biscotti's omelet with no cheese. It comes with two sides including various meats, potatoes, and fruit. I chose turkey sausage and fruit. My friend had the seafood or Cajun Benedict. I don't recall. We both also had mimosas. The omelet was bomb! I didn't expect it to be so good. It's incredibly flavorful. You really don't need to add anything to it and that's saying a lot. The mimosa was a generous portion. The orange juice is fresh squeezed. My only complaint is that it was not very strong. I'm very impressed by Biscotti's brunch. I will gladly return."}, {"review_id": "DQtsDiUoUPS3u2HtXI2sEw", "user_id": "ggLdXln1-rAh2eHY4CDZIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "This is a favorite in Jacksonville.  The setting is modern American bistro with sidewalk dining in a lovely historic part of Jacksonville.  I often eat lunch here and the small plate meals and sandwiches are great.  However the dinners and desserts are not too be missed.  Tonight I had the chicken francaise with haystack vegetables and their amazing garlic mashed potatoes.  It was perfectly done with a pop of lemon and capers.  The other item ordered at the table was the blue cheese beef medallions.  Again with the haystack vegetable and delicious garlic potatoes.  I've had that several times and highly recommend this dish.  The beef medallions are perfectly seasoned and done so that a fork is all that is needed.  Almost more importantly, I was able to skip an appetizer and save room for dessert.  The desserts set this place apart.  You will often see people arrive and only order a piece of cake or their signature bread pudding.  Tonight we ordered the triple chocolate and the mixed berry cake.  Sharing the deep rich chocolate with the fluffy light berry was perfect.  I ordered coffee to delay the food coma until I got home!Thanks to the great staff there for another great experience!"}, {"review_id": "RUkHE1FjYsYlp2EhfnQWZA", "user_id": "EcztwGePOxijZs4uMHS5gg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Best place for a meal and cake.

I will drive 25 minutes whenever I'm craving dessert just to have the cake from here. The price of a slice is around $10, but you get a huge slice of the best cake you will ever have. Their cheesecake is rich and dense and the triple chocolate cake is heavenly. The chocolate cake somehow was rich, but light at the same time, and both cakes had the most perfect texture. All of their cakes I have tried have been delicious and the staff at the front is always super friendly, helpful, and knowledgable about their sweets and will gladly will help you pick the right slice for your mood. I give this four stars, only because I cannot speak for the food options and although the cake is delicious, $10 may be too much for some people."}, {"review_id": "r3VSKdmO8kwh-7f_a90V1A", "user_id": "DJmUlVJenOWsVOozu6tb1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "My go-to delicious \"treat myself\" brunch spot!Everything I have tried on the menu has been delicious.  Just sit back and enjoy.The waffle covered in fresh blueberries and whipped cream is certainly a tummy pleaser.  (my latest discovery)The sides...roasted potatoes, cheesy grits, and fresh fruit with a little mint zing are always a hit.The Eggs Benedict with the Steak Medallions is a great choice.  It's hearty yet not over whelming.I love the mimosa with my meal and the desserts are sooooo huge and tasty!  Take something sweet  home if you are too full.  You will thank me later!"}, {"review_id": "j_KXA3QvBAnRjTRSe9faXA", "user_id": "HUw0S-dz6oCTZiE790-7HQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "How have I not written a review for this Avondale staple.  It's hands down one of the BEST restaurants in Jacksonville.  I remember when it opened in 1993.  I thought, \"Wow...

Affordable (not cheap) local flavor served with passion and efficiency. Aside from a hiccup in service when it took a hot minute for the hostess to seat us, this was a flawless experience in terms pricing, location, decor, table service, food quality, and turnover time. Brunch for two with a water and an OJ to drink + tip came to ~$30.FULL Review: Parking and seating were not at all problems at 10:30 on a Sunday. The restaurant was well kept, the employees were working hard, and there were no signs of distress from the staff or customers. Our server was at the table within three minutes for drinks and immediately took our orders within two of that. She kept the cups filled and remained professional and friendly from start to finish.My biscotti omelette was well-portioned, cooked perfectly, served quickly, and tasted delicious. Fruit cup and fried potato eighths (+ roasted tomatoes, a pleasant surprise!) were flawless. Everything was presented well and the aroma of the omelette was a rare treat. Would like to steal that recipe.Hunny's brunch (eggs benedict with cheese grits) was equally good.We don't frequent Jacksonville, but upon a future visit Biscottis would be a go-to if we found ourselves in need of morning sustenance. Keep up the good work, Biscottis.SPECIAL NOTES: Do note that one of the photos showcasing the brunch menu is outdated. Everything is about $2 more expensive as of October, 2017. Our table was a little wobbly and the folded napkin beneath it didn't offer much reprieve. The management should see to this and all similar issues ASAP."}, {"review_id": "SL5sCpzR90Q6s3Zo7OlisA", "user_id": "JSU2XvRtaHmqKN7EEDA2hA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Two cons-- we don't go often enough and I wish they had more dining space.Too many pros---the food is always great and those desserts are insanely delicious."}, {"review_id": "iNoza6vc7qusaFj2gxN-Kw", "user_id": "bVBNzWLhov4X1wvzBV6LTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/9/2017", "text": "Pre-Hurricane Irma, I spent some time with my man friend before we were separated by the storm. We decided to go to lunch at Biscottis. We got there and were immediately seated. It took a while before the waiter came to the table. He apologized for a mixup and asked what we wanted to drink. We were already ready to order so we proceeded with that. We both requested a water with lemon. The waiter forgot my lemons but that's a honest mistake. He had the lunch special which was a pasta that had jamon, mushrooms and goat cheese. He added chicken. I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich with fries. I assume he enjoyed his pasta bc there was none left. The smoked turkey sandwich was super delicious. I asked for it hot. The bread was crispy and the marinated tomatoes really set it off. I don't even like tomatoes typically. The fries were perfectly fried. And I like to consider myself a french fry connoisseur.  We decided to indulge in dessert. We asked for a menu and the waiter said he would take us on a tour of the dessert counter. We decided on a slice of champagne cake to share. It was beautiful to the eye and had a slight taste of champagne. It was so good. I will definitely go back for brunch! Love the area and the food was good!"}, {"review_id": "08qUIUsn1LaIvOSqyJ-3cw", "user_id": "g16kmCYG9LOXsB2Ufzl0yA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Great local Avondale restaurant with delicious bakery and menu items. Everything is made from scratch, and having breakfast or lunch here is always a good bet on St Johns Avenue. Not the least expensive option downtown, but better than most other options. Over a dozen cakes, pies and bread pudding to choose from, changing daily, and they also have daily specials including a soup du jour. Excellent coffees and a nice wine selection. This is the tasty business meeting place of choice in Avondale & is moderately upscale but fun. Outdoor seating available, and 3 rooms of tables.
