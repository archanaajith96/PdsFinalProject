I appreciate the aesthetic of places and spaces and this is one of those wins. Great art, great set up, great decor, great furniture, great layout, and always clean. The service is top notch and I've always experienced friendly staff members. Depending on the time of day and actual day that you are there it can get very KID friendly and if that's not your jam, then I'd suggest going to another place. It's located right outside the kids water area of the Pearl and a lot of families like to go in and grab a tea/coffee and treat their kiddos to the amazing Lorraine macarons. Speaking of that ... I love a great macaron and they are fabulous at this. I had the margarita flavored one this time around and it was so festive and delicious at the same time. I also ordered an iced black tea and that was lovely. Yes, I've had horrible iced tea (not from here but in general) and they make a great iced tea. Not only is it a great place to meet up with friends, go on a date, take your grandparents or parents to, or just to enjoy the day on your own, this is a great place for all of the above ... the food and drinks and customer service is top notch."}, {"review_id": "7hY7orKLTDA0cJ7rNM5w0Q", "user_id": "HGTdyEDygTqANThO64WDWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "We came here in the evening while the kids were playing in the courtyard right outside the bakery. There are actually two open turf areas surrounding this restaurant. The ambiance is great and the decor is vibe very fresh, modern, and clean.They serve your traditional bakery fare along with some kitchen items.Beware though as the kitchen closes at 6pm do don't expect to eat dinner here. We did get a croissant and it was large and excellent. It was the end of the day so as soon as they run out of something, that is it. The croissant was $4 and while overpriced, really hit the spot."}, {"review_id": "3Ip5_UrCX_hvLoTr3FNT4w", "user_id": "ey1G8fMggvvrly3x3FInMQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Good, but not great. The location of this Bakery Lorraine is very nice & has a relaxing ambiance. The large windows that fill the walls inside give you the opportunity to look out and gaze at what's going on at the pearl. There is also seating outside if you decide you want to eat your food enjoying the weather. Besides the ambiance & location I'm not a huge fan of the actual baked goods. Many times, to me, they have been dry & bland. For a place that is so hyped I was hoping to be wowed by their actual products, but unfortunately my experiences have been anticlimactic."}, {"review_id": "W87TJVMX3MKe7jxXc3M_AA", "user_id": "GJgSb309PWhbHngbRjvC3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Family came in to visit from out of town, and I wanted to take them to the Pearl. Came to the Bakery Lorraine for an iced coffee on a hot day. I ordered the cold brew, which is strong and smooth. I add the home made vanilla syrup and a splash of creamer. After ogling all the delicious desserts in the display, we selected the Lemon bar, a slice of cheesecake and a six pack of macarons. They always seem to have an assortment of flavors and I ordered two pistachio, two raspberry, one margarita and one angel food cake. Pistachio is my favorite, and raspberry is a close second. The margarita was what I expected a little tart and tasty. The angel food cake tasted like vanilla. The cheesecake was dense and delicious. But the lemon bar was the crowd pleaser as it was sweet, tart and light. This is always a great place to cool down and sample a sweet treat."}, {"review_id": "vbYy2tzTklDYJ2WexnFMnA", "user_id": "0egK5ylmjI_kHsYVjo2XDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Stopped here for a quick breakfast before heading out to the market and shops on a busy Saturday morning.  Quickly was served delicious quiche Lorraine-- wow!

Both were great but the eggnog one won my heart. (This was around Christmas time). Bakery lorraine is such a beautiful bakery in the Pearl brewery.  The decor inside is so cool.    The second time around was after lunch one afternoon. My mom in law and I grabbed some dessert. She got a fruit tart and I got a few macarons once again.  I finally tried the Earl grey one and fell in love. I will never ever get another flavor other than that one. It tastes exactly like fruit loops!  I crave these all the time now.  So if you know me, that's what I want for my birthday.

I think this is my favorite dessert from them.   If you have not tried their pop tart, RUN bc they always sell out of it.  Now I see why.  The breaded part is more of like a short bread cookie texture but oh so delicious and not at all bland like store bought ones.  The filling definitely tastes homemade, very fruity and sweet enough.  The beautiful Topping of the pop tart are crushed macarons, yes macarons!!!  I have cravings for this pop tart now."}, {"review_id": "uNQaX7nhEEn1C2RWmpnFZQ", "user_id": "fQNnz8_uVjSRjfkw-eAV6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Always so busy, but I love their pastries just as equally as I love the people who work there.I was quite happy with my croissant as usual, I just wish they served Kerry Gold butter to top it off with). My daughter wasn't too keen on the Earl Grey macaroon. I'm not sure why she was being spontaneous by ordering this but she did. I am personally not a fan of them, any flavor, it's a texture thing for me.

The mood can be a bit jarring, as my partner mentioned: Southerners in a French bakery give off a very touristy vibe. I've had a ton of their macarons. Among my favorite are the Earl Grey and Spurs Throwback. The Salted Caramel is one I wouldn't get again. Others that are alright include Pistachio, Chocolate, Strawberry, Lemon, Cereal, and I don't remember what else. I still don't really get the hype around macarons, but people really like them so I guess I should keep trying. Besides that, I highly recommend the Grilled cheese ($9). It is just heavenly. I got the side salad and it was kind of horrid. The Sautéed Spinach sandwich was also a hit, as was the soup. The cutlery, napkins and to-go boxes are self serve, for those who aren't familiar with the layout of the bakery. Wifi is provided, and there are plenty of nooks for those needing to study for a bit. A neat, versatile little spot."}, {"review_id": "BHb4Z-2BsVn3QfoyfQq8vw", "user_id": "RXd4ICvGSTOJaQ0rX2GDMg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "I've read so much about the pearl area so I had to check out the bakery when I was in the area.  The building and area are super nice, lots of natural light!  I loved the decor.  The menu has breakfast, lunch, and dessert items. You order at a counter and then can choose your table. We only were there for dessert and go it to go. I was a little disappointed by the lack of variety in the bakery case. There were 5 different types of cookies, a couple tarts, a couple types of cake, and 4 types of macarons. I was hoping that with bakery in the name, the desserts would be plentiful.  We got a slice of cake and two macarons. They were delicious, so this place definitely has that going for it!

Line was very long inside he store so it took a while for us to finally order.We ordered the kouign amann and fruit tart to dine-in and ordered almond croissant and Mexican hot chocolate cookie to-go.Kouign amann was not very crispy and had jam in the middle. Not what we're used to. The fruit tart was good. Fruits were fresh and ripe laid over a light vanilla custard.Mexican hot chocolate cookie was very unique. The cookie was dusted with habanero sugar so there was a slight kick at the end of each bite. Almond croissant was ok.
