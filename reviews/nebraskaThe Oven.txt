Everything is made in a really bad tomato puree. The gravy for the makhani and the malai kofta doesn't have any cream in it. I don't know since when malai kofta became a tomato puree based dish? Only thing going for this place is the wine and the decor which is why i gave it 2 stars. I don't mean to bust your bubble but you guys aren't serving indian food. You're food has an audience and maybe that's who your target audience is but I was disappointed."}, {"review_id": "W6v4GZ1OHTxa8SWrjg6bEw", "user_id": "GOxnbyUSfjHpw4G3cU36cw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "A return to the spot of our first date four years later...and our tastes are much improved!  Service was good, unfortunate they seat you in those long community booths when you're  a party of 2 because then you get to listen to other people's awkward first date conversations.  We started with chicken tikka bread as well as a half order of the mixed appetizer.  The bread was good, some heat.  The appetizer had some pluses: the chicken and sausage, the misses: the veggies lacked flavor.  We both had the soup: enjoyable.  I got the chicken tikka masala and my fiancé the lamb with the creamy curry sauce.  We both enjoyed them greatly and took leftovers to savor later.  A large wine selection with about average prices.  We will return!"}, {"review_id": "XJpBzhmrqcCaCujgpUTV3w", "user_id": "xA5Wi6awwCG_1TZYWg4G2A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/9/2017", "text": "First time in Lincoln, NE.  We did not seek this place out, but one of those places you just stumble upon.  Wow, did we stumble upon a gem!The atmosphere was cozy with interesting decor.We ordered the samosas - which seemed house-made.  They were delicious.  Many Indian restaurants tend to use those frozen samosas and fry them until they are bubbled and translucent.  These are not those!  Some of the best samosas I've had, and I'm sort of an Indian food connoisseur.We ordered the Vegetarian Thali (aka sampler), and there was not a dish on there we didn't like.I would highly recommend this place for some good Indian food."}, {"review_id": "j-fTvU0S9DvuX6Sf96SPsA", "user_id": "4YS4p4mF2jGLPb0jfKFpGA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/7/2017", "text": "Sorry, but these is not much that is authentic about the meal I just had.

Overall I enjoyed the experience but wasn't wowed. Lincolnites often herald the Oven's praises but I have to say I still favor Tandoor.Let's start with the food. The mulligatawny soup was probably my favorite part of the meal. It was a little earthy, a little lemonade, and had a nice creamy texture without being too dense. I ordered the chicken makhani (my usual measuring stick) and my friend got the goa chicken (chicken in a blended cashew sauce). I thought that both were pretty tasty, but overall lacked some seasoning and depth of flavor. The chicken makhani tasted a lot like tomato and was quite chunky. I prefer a smoother sauce. The goa chicken was unique and the cashew flavor was rich but not overpowering. The dish could have used a little acid or some salt though. Our entrées came with plenty of rice which was just a little on the dry side. I will say though that for the dinner portion, they were very reasonably priced. I believe each entrée was $13. The service we experienced was quite odd. The waiter was very absent-minded, and seemed a little lost as he wandered through the restaurant. For example, he forgot to bring the salad dressing with the salad, and when we asked him about it he said \"oh shoot... I had it...\" it was just a little strange. He was very slow moving and not all that attentive. That coupled with the fact that it was a busy Saturday night made the meal last quite a long time. We weren't in a rush, but we were quite hungry by the time the entrées arrived."}, {"review_id": "OuD_W6Phu7Dv2gf9U3vnzQ", "user_id": "s3xnOywTMJYs9sVroNI6Mg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2017", "text": "This is by far the best place and my favorite place to eat out in Lincoln. I've been coming here for 27 years. A few things have changed over time but overall the consistency is good. Cocktails are great, wine selection is outstanding,  food is spiced incredibly well. The hardest decision is what to eat because there are so many amazing dishes. The soup is out of this world, veggie samosas are delicious, lamb, chicken, and veggie dishes are all divine. It's mothers milk in my book. The breads are lacking the exquisiteness they once boasted but are still better than most I've had anywhere else. If I could give it 4.5 I would. I've lived in other states and traveled to many other countries, The Oven's Indian food (and some specialties from Bhutan) tops my list worldwide. Lincoln is lucky to have them."}, {"review_id": "Gt5-8-lMwILTpcgrOTLRjQ", "user_id": "CokRLvEE5bns_kEI5eMOxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/13/2017", "text": "This is in a wonderful location for people watching from the patio in the Haymarket area which is chock full of boutiques, charming restaurants and people being out and about.The service was attentive and the menu was very vegetarian and gluten- free friendly.

Would make an amazing place for a date night especially with the dim lighting of the place. I'm a night fan of their Chicken Madras Bryani (very filling), their chicken and beef curries are good too but not the best when compared from other Indian restaurants based on my personal opinion. Their yogurt sauce (forgot the name) is pretty good. Their lentil soup is one of the best I had. Their naans are quite decent too. Over all the place is nice and I usually go there once in 3 weeks. Hope my review helps!

Everyone at our table was pretty pleased with their meals, from the meaty tandoori dishes to vegetarian entrees - I didn't keep track of exactly what everyone ordered.If you're new to Indian food or want to try a variety of thing on the menu, I'd recommend the Thali! Feeds 2 (very generously - we were stuffed and couldn't finish it all) or 3 (probably just the right amount of food for 3 people who aren't overly hungry), great price.They also have a few craft beers on tap; I also glanced at the wine list - pretty nice selection!

The Paneer Kulcha naan felt like a Chicago style stuffed pizza (it was located with the naans on the menu). I am not a naan connoisseur, but I had not encounter a naan like this before. It was tasty, and much heavier than the traditional flatbread naan we thought we were ordering.The waitress was very accommodating of our large group, and quickly fixed a mistake that was made with our friend's order.
