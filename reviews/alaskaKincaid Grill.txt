Try pork chop instead.Tried 3 different desserts and they were delicious.

The humble strip mall location belies the treasure within.Through the portal a quiet elegance awaits.  Tasteful art on the walls, calming color scheme, tablecloths, attentive waitstaff.We began with a poached pear salad. Fresh greens, candied pecans, gorgonzola, wine poached pears, in a honey tabasco dressing was a perfect rendition of this classic combo.  It stood up to our medium bodied pinot noir, as did the entrees.  The first entree was a salmon special.  The salmon was blackened, yet at the same time  the filet was light and moist. Over it was a pickled red pepper jam that allowed tart, hot, and sweet notes to color the succulent fish. Under that was kale, and that was over a base of purple cauliflower puree.  The dish was memorable and masterful. Our second entree was duck. It had smoked breast that was extremely tender. It also had a confit leg that had crisp overlying skin. The duck was over a mound of blended sweet potatoes, and that sat over a cherry gastrique with islands of balsamic.  Wow.Desert was a chocolate bourbon souffle with a side of creme anglaise, and a sliced strawberry. Far and away the best meal that we had in our eleven day stay in Alaska."}, {"review_id": "WXg1PU5vFNq3VN23ywjfyQ", "user_id": "Prx3Egow2yL4WrZU0CQcFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We have been coming here with friends and family for many years and again last night the food and service was faultless. With each visit there is always something new to WOW you. Drew is so innovative and always never ceases to amaze us. I can promise you that you can pick anything on the menu and be very pleased to see how beautifully presented and spectacularly tasty everything is. The waitress was AWESOME she was so professional as was all of the wait staff. We had the fresh king salmon and it was cooked to perfection as were the mussels for an appetizer. The beet salad was to die for as was the Gumbo and Crème Brulee.  I will never get tired of coming to this establishment.

I finally dined here in a chilly night in September. My family and I started off with several appetizers including some fabulous crab cakes, fresh oysters, a Caesar salad and the Mediterranean Plate. The crab cakes were not weighed down by bread crumbs and veggies but consisted mostly of crab, which was a pleasant surprise! I really enjoyed the Mediterranean plate, it had an assortment of things like hummus, feta, olives, tomatoes and roasted peppers to put on a crostini or pita. I wish they put vegetables like cucumbers (lower carb) and more hummus on the plate though! I also liked the Caesar salad, the dressing was creamy and had the perfect Caesar taste. I don't eat oysters but my mom loved them!Our main courses came some time after but that wasn't a problem since we were talking and having a good time. I was very pleased with my seafood cioppino. The pieces of fish were large, the prawns were delicious and the scallops were perfectly cooked. My favorite part about this dish was the wonderful tomato broth, it was so flavorful. I didn't get a chance to try my dads scallops but his risotto was good. My boyfriend's lamb looked amazing (I don't eat land animal meat), I did try the greens and beans that accompanied his dish and they were seasoned and cooked perfectly. I really enjoyed his side! My mom's prays we're great too! The sauce was flavorful and complemented the prawns and the cornbread. We did settle on getting dessert. We got the chocolate soufflé and mouse. Chocolate wasted doesn't even come close to describe our desserts. But they were worth every bite. The soufflé was fluffy and soft. The mousse was chocolaty, creamy and wonderfully balanced. Service was so attentive, my water glass was never empty, our plates were cleared in a timely manner and our food came out at good intervals. Our waitress was nice and patient with us even after we ordered the 15 minute to make soufflé with only 5 minutes until their last seating at 10pm. I can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "7TgbaLU6IBIjDHp1JJZABQ", "user_id": "B064PQj97-WcEKDcn3zdTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "This is the best food that we have eaten so far in Alaska.  The portions are smaller than many places, but you don't go there to \"fill up\" on food.  You go there for the taste and the feeling you get eating in a nice restaurant.  The wait staff are professional and friendly.  The salad and main courses were very tasty.  My wife loved the gumbo, and we both loved the king crab cakes with the corn relish.  The halibut entree and mashed potatoes are the best of each I've ever eaten.  Final word:  It was not cheap, but we will definitely make this a regular monthly dinner for us."}, {"review_id": "jGfI-vJc9hW66FX7VLkWbg", "user_id": "XLnHngR59J4bKJhsBJg06Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "Located in a small strip mall, this restaurant was a good find.

Our trip last year was quite disappointing in the \"food\" department.  Kincaid works hard to prepare interesting ingredients that result in fine cuisine.  Portions are generous and pricing is on the high side, the result was satisfying.  I had the halibut special; on a bed of polenta with smoked corn and tomato mixture.  Topped with a stalk of rhubarb. Husband had two appetizers; lamb chops and oysters.  Both generous and filling.Our shared salad was missing the cheese.  When mentioned in passing to the waiter it was immediately removed from our bill.  We did not expect that; shows class.Dessert did not disappoint either:chocolate pot de creme.  Great meal, great waitstaff too."}, {"review_id": "X7Kop-2fOOPBGRVslQ6GjQ", "user_id": "y6kYXnmIGe-uxZKraX7VSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "For my last meal in AK I wanted it to be something special.  I looked up close by restaurants and this was by far the best rated.  So glad I came here for a meal.  They were booked up for the evening but the lady at the desk found me a table as I was there right when they opened.This is a small place in a strip mall but what a gem.  My server Erin was top notch and was very knowledgable of the menu.He suggested a salad for the starter that was Tomato, watermelon, basil and arugula.  Tasted as good as it looked.

The plate presentations are amazing and there is a fresh rose at each table. You will want to come here again and again.

Service was excellent.  Crab cakes and the roasted oyster appetizers where a big hit with all, including my 18 yo son.  I decided on the duck 2 ways with sweet potato mash.  Duck cooked a perfect medium rare.  Husband had the Angus medallions which we also cooked to a medium rare.  Son got the King Prawns dish, that was not a dish anyone at the table enjoyed.  There Cajun butter tasted like butter and tabasco sauce, way to much sauce and it took away the flavor of the prawns and grits.  Seafood Fusion soup was good, but different.  Don't think I would try that again.  Son loved his Gumbo he said it almost tasted as good as mine :)  Desserts, I must admit I eat Crème Brulee anytime it is on the menu. This was probably the best I had. Nailed it.  Smores dessert was also very good and they brought out a candle in whipped cream on the plate for the birthday celebration.  Overall the dinner was a success.  What we had was good except the one dish.

Let's just get the Yelp clichés out of the way in the beginning:\"gem\"\"diamond in the rough\" (I just googled this to make sure I was spelling it correctly, and the first definition that comes up is not at all what I thought this phrase meant. You'll see shortly what I mean by this.  For google's meaning, try this: bfy.tw/POa)\"cool little spot\"\"don't judge a book by its cover\"Etc.This place is in a strip mall, in a largely residential area.  You'd probably never think to go here unless you had a father/mother/uncle-and-his-lover that suggested you do.You should.Don't be scared or turned-off by the strip mall exterior.I walked in and was greeted and given AMAZING, friendly, and prompt service.Maybe I'm insecure about this and just projecting, or maybe these places really are snobby to me.  I'm often younger than the usual demographic at fancy-schmancy places...and often a bit \"rougher\" looking.  What do I mean?  Unruly hair.  Abrasive beard.  Not at all \"dressed up\", etc.  I sometimes feel like a caveman at Victorian tea-time.Not here.I felt like everyone was related to me.  I felt like a family member they hadn't seen in a while.  Sometimes I felt *this close* to their pinching my cheeks and teasing me about not having a girlfriend.  That's how friendly they were!The service was so on point that two different servers rushed over to tell me about the specials.  I heard them twice.  I heard them once and then another server was concerned that perhaps no one had come over and helped me, so she rushed over and gave me the spiel as well.  This is a GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE.I got a special appetizer.  It was ferns.  Local ferns.  I didn't know you could eat ferns, so I had to eat them.  They were very very good!For my main course, I got Kodiak scallops.  Why?  Three reasons:1) I've never had \"Kodiak\" scallops since moving up here, and I love scallops.2) This place seemed like the place to get them at, if I was going to take the plunge.3) They are the marshmallows of the sea!!!!!They were also excellent.  They did not make the grave mistake most \"nice restaurants\" do and give you itty bitty portions that cause your stomach to ask you embarrassing questions like \"is it in yet? I...I can't really feel it...\" All the while it looks just as presentable as those classic \"tiny platings\" you see at high-end joints.I was kinda full, but I decided to listen to the desserts anyway, since my server was so nice.I'm not really into desserts or sweets.  But if I had to pick my favorite type of dessert, it would be CHEESECAKE.They not only had a house-made cheesecake, it was made with GOAT cheese.I have a rule that I order anything with goat cheese, so I took the plunge.Like everything else here, it was one of the best-tasting representatives of its respective food category.The bill came out and it hurt, but only a little.  The quality of the service, food, and portions made the splurge completely worth-while.Just go here."}, {"review_id": "NrWaebKnYZ7yCKurDbNtoA", "user_id": "TNpJa62ucrd3SGznFit3rw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "Definitely five stars!
