The service was friendly and the food was amazing! We ordered the Crispy Fried \"Chicken\" And Waffles (herb-seasoned, fried mock chicken with a Belgian style waffle, arugula, and agave). We also added the spicy sweet chili sauce for $1. The mock chicken was so crispy and delicious! We also shared the Tinga Tacos (corn tortillas with bulgogi seitan, local cabbage, cilantro and radishes). We also added the melted cow's milk cheese for an extra $1. The tacos came with your choice of a side, so we got fried green tomatoes with a pepper jelly.Everything was so delicious and the portions were generous, so we had leftovers. I really want to come back and try some of the other menu items!"}, {"review_id": "GIU46rRi4T9mxjmtGYRY4w", "user_id": "p4ol09XZo7jV4P7wiEJ_Mw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Visited the area and had no idea Raleigh was such a veggie friendly city! We started with the Cornmeal-Fried Oyster Mushrooms with the spicy sweet chili sauce. This was the perfect appetizer! Although it was fried, it was not greasy/oily and did not make me feel sluggish afterwards.Next up was the main dish, the N.C. Peanut Noodle Bowl. We ordered the meal split, and it did not cost extra. Although it was split, there was enough food for two people. This entree was packed with all sorts of cohesive flavors. We order this entree with tofu, which made the meal extra delicious, just keep in mind that the tofu costs extra. Lastly, if you have room for dessert, it seems the dessert menu changes, but the slices of pies are small and good for splitting."}, {"review_id": "z4bp6fFaTqLgnm3vK-OSZQ", "user_id": "tyUMkIVD2zc6b8cbU4plsQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Food great service was lackluster. We were skipped in line by at least two parties of two. We were a party of three. We were told by the hostess that bar was first come first serve, but were quickly reprimanded by the bartender for trying to seat ourselves at the bar when a party of three got up and left. Shortly after, a father daughter duo came in and were seated at the exact bar seats that myself and my two friends tried to claim. My friend expressed concern to the hostess and she informed us that we were next in line. After seeing another couple seated who came in right after us we were finally seated. We ordered a round of drinks when we were seated and two appetizers which were both amazing. Root French fries and the tasting platter. I highly recommend the dill sauce with the French fries. After we sat down food came out relatively promptly. I ordered the chicken and waffles with the sweet chili sauce. They were fantastic. A little on the spicy side. But again. Fantastic. The drinks were VERY strong (which is never a bad thing). Dinner was expensive by the time you add apps and drinks. You should come to this restaurant prepared to spend at least 50 dollars a person.Since we are unable to reply to owner:We were unaware that parties were able to go elsewhere offsite to wait. I will say that while others chose to go offsite, we decided to wait in house and spend money at your bar instead. And the drinks being strong was not a complaint by any means! :) thank you!

Somehow I visited the Fiction Kitchen 2 years in a row for my birthday and I loved it both times. In my latest visit, I have Daily Soup and Eastern NC Style BBQ Pulled \"Pork\" with homemade Corn Bread. The soup had green mustard which made it a bit spicy, and it was perfect for the cold rainy day! Bits of cranberry  and chickpeas went very well with the soup. Love it! The BBQ! If I didn't remember I was at a vegetarian restaurant, I would thought it was regular pork BBQ. The texture and flavor both are incredibly similar to real BBQ, and it's hard to believe the \"pork\" is made out of soy and gluten-based protein. My mom who tried this BBQ for the first time was surprised at how good and real it tasted! The sautéed greens and potato salad that came out with BBQ were also delicious. I love how kale tastes in your sautéed greens. Don't taste any bitterness! Cornbread was, as always, yummy. My mom couldn't stop talking about how delicious the cornbread was. The only downsides of the Fiction Kitchen is how crowded it gets during dinner time. But the food is still worth the wait!"}, {"review_id": "pYCDB2BID-j0kQBF5p2ryg", "user_id": "dBf39SmNQpu7yuUoqw2PSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "An amazing restaurant for vegans and meat-eaters alike.I usually order the bbq \"pork\" here, which is quite possibly my favorite bbq in North Carolina.

I've also enjoyed the cornbread (with vegan pimento cheese and onion jam) and every cocktail I've tried.Pro tip: you're almost always guaranteed a long wait for dinner here. I would check-in with your party and then head somewhere close by for drinks and snacks. There's a lot of good places like Imurj, Whiskey Kitchen, Tasty Beverage, etc. The hostess will give you an estimated time and give you a call when your table is ready!"}, {"review_id": "aObgOU_GAn3ZgPk4bApe5w", "user_id": "sZhR018otVXy-Sow4QTrKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Okay, there are already 700+ reviews on this place so I feel a little redundant posting a review but to summarize:-Make reservations, especially on weekends. At 5pm on a Saturday, the wait was 1.5 hours. They will call you once a spot at the bar or a table is available. -Service: Incredibly friendly and attentive.-Food:         Risotto: I thought it was okay. Since it is cooked in cashew milk, I felt like the rice was not as creamy or soft as a traditional risotto. I enjoyed the veggies that came on top though. They were cooked to perfection. A part of me wishes I took advantage of the fact that they had meat substitutes. Instead, I ordered something that is traditionally vegetarian, and I feel like the real magic here lies in the deceptive 'meat' dishes. I'll definitely come back and try them sometime!Peanut butter cheesecake: This was delicious! When I eat cheesecake, I get an incredibly bloated feeling because it is so rich. However, I felt totally fine after sharing this cheesecake with my friend. I will say, if you're not crazy about peanut butter, I wouldn't recommend it. It is SUPER peanut buttery.-Drinks:          We ordered one cocktail to share called the Pumpernickel Hatchback and it wasn't what I was expecting. It wasn't terrible but I don't think I would order it again. It was kind of like drinking a diluted slightly spiced milk. -Parking:             A little tricky but you can find street parking around Nash Square which is just a short walk away."}, {"review_id": "Z9icsX2NPcQd2JMa65Egww", "user_id": "henDqMyd5F1K6jBnHTrYqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "How awesome it was to find a place that is remaking southern comfort classics in a vegan/vegetarian way!The Fiction Kitchen was poppin' on a Sunday afternoon for brunch, but luckily I was seated within a few minutes at the bar.

Everything was great, although I have to admit the biscuits were leaning a tad towards gummy instead of flaky-- but still delicious when smothered in their house-made blackberry jam!I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Raleigh for some of the other menu items.

But I didn't love the spongy waffle Noodle Bowl- I loved the noodle bowl in the beginning but the peanut flavor became very overwhelming since there was a ton of sauce in the bottom of the bowl. It's probably a matter of personal taste but I could have done with half of the sauce and the same amount of noodles.Overall we had a good experience here. I liked the place but didn't love it.

I know their hours are kinda wonky, (open for dinner only?) so we planned to get here shortly after opening. We arrived around 5:15 on a Saturday which is early but with special event menu (for HopScotch) the place is packed!! A 30 minute wait w a toddler is murder but we suffered through it. And boy was it worth it. We ordered some chips & salsa to get started and kinda felt cheated by the number of chips we got. The salsas were very good and surprisingly the thimbles worth of peach was good. The guac & salsa got put in the \"to go\" zone since we ran out of chips. Wife & daughter got the #2 burrito, I got the \"seasonal quinoa risotto\".  Which is full of veggies. NOT A PROBLEM.... it was incredible.

That says something, but not sure what, except it may be hard to identify who's working and who's dining! There's a bar area for drinking and eating, and two waiting areas- one inside and one outside. Don't be surprised if you have to wait!They are a popular joint, with exceptional ingredients jammed into brunch or dinner deliciousness (lunch, too, I suppose). There's a focus on local ingredients, and you can taste the freshness in the salads and fruit.For vegans, you will be so tempted to dive in and consume carbs like they're going out of style. Admittedly, I loaded up when brunching- vegan grits and gluten free vegan pancakes. Dang- the South can deliver for vegans too! Yes! It's good they're not closer to my home base, cause I'd be one fattened up consumer!The desserts are fun and tasty- I think the chocolate ganache tart may be the most popular with a caramel sauce and coconut almond crust. It's a slice of chocolate gluten-free heaven!The chicken and waffles are classic for any vegan who misses that stuff. The entrees are not mind blowing in how novel they are, but that there is such a diverse selection of items makes for a delicious eclectic menu that will make your tastebuds tingle! Tacos, curry, salad- it's up to you. The menu and staff are informative for those who don't eat or eschew soy or gluten.  There are not a whole bunch of options for raw foodies, but you can manage.In a nutshell, this place is deserving of the hype.

The waiter seemed very engaged and the service was super quick once you sat down. Ambiance:The venue isn't incredibly big so typically you might get stuck with a bar seat, also some of the seating arrangements are strange.

I had a platter with two eggs over easy, sweet potato hash, a biscuit, and soysage patties. The food was very good, but I will say not incredibly filling. My girlfriend and I decided to get a dessert, since they have a vegan tres leches cake. Wow, it did not dissapoint. Sure it was a spot of version, but the fact that it was vegan and so delicious was wild. Highly recommend trying it.Price:The price for our meal was pretty decent. We both came in around $27 for brunch and dessert. This seemed pretty reasonable to me. Tip: Careful going on a day that might be rainy because there is limited space inside to wait.
