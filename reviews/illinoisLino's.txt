This is tied for best Italian food in Rockford in my opinion. The decor is very nice. They have a cute little fountain in the front entryway. All the servers wear the same black dress so every thing is cohesive. Let's talk food. The special salad is delish. It's a lettuce mix with Italian sausage slices, cherry tomatoes, and hard boiled eggs all tossed in their house dressing. A must with any entree you get here. The pizza is so cheesy when you pull it apart it actually looks the commercials on tv. I always get pepperoni and Italian sausage. The pizza is always cut in squares which I absolutely love (this might just be a Rockford thing lol)I got the lasagna this last time and it is literally melt in your mouth. There is no meat in the lasagna itself, but there is meat in the sauce. If you can only make one pizza stop in Rockford, make it Linos. You won't regret it!"}, {"review_id": "fsH0cxzrlg21ssNMalVJpg", "user_id": "sc53zxuewS_BNx9vjBhdEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "This is arguably one of the best in our area. OK Linos ala chicken. You can only get it one night, it's on special. I'm not telling its already too dam busy.Seriously some of the best chicken I've ever had. Has a very fine grain, very moist, tender. It's baked, but seasoned just right. The skin is crispy. These people are knocking it out of the park.I just ordered to have something different. I'm glad I did that. I've had it twice so far. It's really good.This place is busy Mickayla is very happy person, she likes what she does and it shows. She has a very bright smile, and very kind, she knows the food. So if you have any Linos questions at all she'll be quick to answer. Other wise I've seen her move very fast to get drinks or to serve your order with a smile. Watch her work, she is a true professional."}, {"review_id": "R9HIdb1rXZu25-YUqgQIoQ", "user_id": "wAguavEkMIKRY-ROMfQpKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Best lemon veal .

The veal was tender and tasty.  The spaghetti was rather plain, but I kicked it up a notch with some red chili flakes.  The bread was warm and melted the butter nicely.  Overall a good Italian meal.  I noticed a back entrance where you pick up pizzas and to-go orders.  I will probably come back to try their pizzas.  My ticket before tip was $12.73, not bad for a good meal."}, {"review_id": "86_Z2sjFPgZ0ZofNgk4Xwg", "user_id": "KEVpj14EaioEmBT3JyU4lA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "We can't possibly say enough good things about Lino's Restaurant in Rockford. We have been going there regularly since my Wife and I first started dating over 4 years ago and never have had a bad meal.We had our Wedding Reception in one of their Banquet Rooms last night, and the food was fantastic, it was just like in the main restaurant upstairs. Kelly Morton was our contact to make the arrangement for our event and we couldn't have asked for a better person to work with. The staff and service were exceptional and the food was plentiful.Thank you for making our celebration even better than we could have imagined."}, {"review_id": "xbnzCmE3MbaCW9pPmCM4Ow", "user_id": "JCadpTDWwN38gmS3zwlTSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Best pizza in Rockford!

I immediately was drawn to the place's atmosphere and Italy-inspired decor. The staff was especially memorable, because our server still happened to be a trainee, and yet I was impressed at how handled everything. I also appreciated the helpfulness and patience of the more experienced waitress who was providing the training for that day. I ordered the baked cod while my partner had one of the steak dishes; we were both stuffed and more than satisfied with how everything tasted.

It is like visiting your Grandma's house, even though she has bought some new items and painted the place, it still looks, smells and feels familiar. The service was quick, attentive and friendly, the food was hot and tasty and the memories were familiar and comforting. If you went to Lino's as a kid or young adult many, many years ago, you owe yourself the time machine experience of going again. While they've modernized to keep up with the times, they've retained just enough of their past so you can feel the familiar embrace of days gone by."}, {"review_id": "5fFVoW30fgb-xiGmkTfunQ", "user_id": "QS08OZddNzh4vtJcCmqwDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "My in-laws invited us for Jazz night in the bar it was very nice good music and good food, I plan on going back on Thursday with my husband now!
