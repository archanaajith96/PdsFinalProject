Stared off the night with the Korean fried chicken which I can say is the only thing any of us had that we would order again. Then the calamari which would have been better as a cold frutti di mare salad than the lukewarm sautéed bits of squid that it was, served with stale crostini. My first main course was the Manhattan filet. I ordered it blue rare. It came out well done 50% of the way through and then rare for a sliver of the center. It was also not a filet but a tough sinewy slab of some other cut of a beef. It was also marinated in something which clashed with all the other flavors on the plate. Only the sautéed broccolini was worth eating. I sent it back and swapped it for the shrimp and grits. Another fail. The dish was soupy. The grits were somehow thin and over laden with cheese; of such a consistency they could not be eaten with a fork. It was also topped with a sauce possibly tomato based, thin, with a component of beer or wine which had not been completely cooked down. The shrimp were small, over seasoned and over cooked. I wasn't going to send a second dish back so I just stopped eating. My mom had the pork belly. While better than my two choices the plating was awkward. A large square piece of belly on a bed of slippery maux choux on a small plate with no extra room to cut the meat. The sweet potato gnocchi it came with were fried to being over crisp but then soaked in the sauce of the dish which left them gummy.Service was prompt and polite but completely betrayed by the kitchen.Sadly, I won't be going back."}, {"review_id": "tJ_ZP7LpJjMD67F4Ow9ceA", "user_id": "8l2GpNX3PNJfGCLTRfLrfg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "The duck tacos were scrumptious as was the Strongbow hard cider draft (yes, I was impressed this was on draft in Sioux Falls, I must admit).

I was in town on business, so I was dining solo. I walk in as the host is greeting and seating another table. He casually mentions in my direction that the wait is 20 minutes, then goes to seat the other diners. After that he goes behind the bar and eventually disappears into the back.fast forward 12 minutes (I timed this on my phone) the host never comes back over to me, never asks my name, never offers to seat me at the bar or anything, literally my entire interaction with him was \"the wait's about 20 minutes\".Another group of people walk in, about 3/4 people, he immediately comes over, greets them, explains that there's a 30 min wait (interestingly enough the wait went up) but there is also seating at the bar, and they can sit there while they wait for their table. They agree and he writes their name.Remember they came in 12 minutes after me, my name was never taken, and now I'm just sitting on the sofa like a schmuck as he walks this group over to the bar and then disappears again. Still he hasn't said more than \"the wait's 20 minutes\". Finally I get up and leave after almost waiting the full 20 minutes (I waited 17 minutes in total)."}, {"review_id": "A5a3PUafKOjaXeKeEiGWzg", "user_id": "sYy7J8BvSLxSCgBsx4KLhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "Food and service are consistently good.

Instead of telling us we should have checked in and correcting the problem himself; he makes an ordeal about it.. Kind of shuns us and says \"one of you needs to go back inside and check in with our server\" - at that point I'm not irritated yet so I say no problem and walk back inside and up front to find the hostess or whoever I am supposed to look for. I am standing in the wrong section and the waiter who told me to do this comes in and walks right past me without saying a word.Eventually I find the hostess myself and to my dismay she is the rudest, snottiest, most conceited person I have had the misfortune of running into. She asks shockingly in a condescending manner \"ok.. So you just seated YOURSELVES??\" Rolls her eyes, turns her head after saying \"well...\" Then continues to tell me about the mistake I made. Then hands me my menus and silverware that could have just been brought to me and rudely says \"well do you wanna just take this since you think you can seat yourself\" I humbly apologize saying \"I'm sorry about that, I didn't think it would be a big deal or effect you guys too much\"... Then She feels the need to tell me that I was wrong for thinking that as her back is turned to me to help another customer.. She's being rude and not even looking at me. As I walk away after being treated like a peasant i decide to suggest to my fiancé that we go to JL beers on her birthday instead. We both agree that sounds like a much better idea. Wanted to give it a chance, but I'd never give money to a place who hires people like that."}, {"review_id": "Lpd8osieStmp-xL4dHpXig", "user_id": "Q30MI2lNHDoe0dqg2sXF6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "THIS USED TO BE A 5 but the last 2 times I went in the food was way too over seasoned, though still delicious.

There is just something about a little live music that really heightens the experience!-The bartender really warmed up when she found out we were from out of town. She started suggesting all of these local options we should try from crepes to red beer. She even explained the olive beer phenomenon to me! I found her to be extremely personable and so excited to share things about Sioux Falls. We stayed for a couple of beers and had a nice time. Good selection of local beers on tap, and she let us taste a few in order to make our selection. We didn't eat, but the food looked absolutely amazing! From the end of the bar, we had a clear view into the kitchen.

Bros Brasserie is what I describe as a trendy gastro-pub set in Sioux Falls' historic district.  With high ceilings accented with old Victorian-style ceiling tiles, red walls, brightly colored abstract paintings on the walls and the open kitchen atmosphere where you can watch the action, I can see how it could be a popular evening meeting spot for young professionals and tourists alike. During our visit, there were only a few people dining during the lunch hour--mostly in the outside eating area. The lunch menu had a good selection of entrees ranging from appetizers, soups, salads and sandwiches--most in the $12 range. I ordered the Steak Sandwich and my husband ordered the gumbo. Schroeder Steak Sandwich ($14):Hanger steak, gorgonzola-garlic aioli, spicy tomato jam, shaved red onions, local butter bibb lettuce, house made ciabatta. I ordered this sandwich with the Gorgonzola-garlic aioli on the side and I am sure glad I did. The aioli had a really strange after taste that was not pleasant.  I ended up using mayonnaise instead of the flavored aioli. The \"spicy tomato jam\" was delicious but was not spicy at all.  Instead, it tasted like super sweet tomatoes. I really loved the tomato jam just the way it was.  The meat was perfectly cooked--medium rare. The red onions were thinly sliced and not shaved as advertised (not a deal breaker) and last but not least, the steak was served on sliced toasted bread that was more like a huge crouton than grilled bread. (It definitely was not the Chiabatta bread that the menu said the sandwich would come on.) I would have preferred the Chiabatta over the toasted bread (giant crouton) but I did like the texture differences between the crunch of the outer areas of the toasted bread and the softness of the meat.Having said all that, the sandwich was good and I would order it again. Just next time, I would substitute mayonnaise for the Gorgonzola-garlic aioli, and either serve it open face with only one of the giant croutons or I'd get it with the Chiabatta bread. (I know that the crouton toast was not substituted in for the Chiabatta because they were out as I saw guests who ordered and received food after me get the Chiabatta bread.)Andouille and Chicken Gumbo:  The flavor of this dish was pretty good but there were only 5 thin slices of andouille sausage and NO CHICKEN at all. Also, half of the rice was under-cooked (it was not al dente.  It was more like crunchy and starchy undercooked rice that needed another 20 minutes of cooking time).  The gumbo was served in a huge bowl that was nearly empty. It was like they served cup of gumbo then put it in the larger serving bowl that was reserved for the bowl-sized portion.  The gumbo was not worth the money even if the food was perfectly cooked and there was chicken in it. Although the steak sandwich was good, it didn't live up to the expectation set by the menu. The steak sandwich, as served, is a 3 star rating with the potential of a 4 if executed as described. As for the gumbo, we would give it a 1 1/2 star rating.  Quite frankly, it failed on just about every level--lack of chicken, only a small amount of andouille, extremely undercooked rice and a super small portion size. Perhaps this was an \"off-day\" for the staff but based on our experience, I might try another restaurant.  I would give them a second chance because I see their potential but I doubt I return in the near future as I live pretty far away."}, {"review_id": "dRciBQdU4N0ZIbTIGgf1Tg", "user_id": "dbbLKe2WFJQ5RvKKsyLiZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/19/2015", "text": "The food is quite special and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed. However, the prices are a little over my budget, but nonetheless worth it for the experience and pleasant vibe. I recommend the burger, duck, and pork belly, but just be aware that their recommended medium rare for the duck is barely cooked. On the other hand, the steak is much too salty, charred on the outside, and not a high quality meat (is tough)."}, {"review_id": "NfRqodTckMwYVO-ebZ-UcQ", "user_id": "JjXoayGvODG9xJYXCeuelQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/3/2014", "text": "Smoked Salmon Louie to go, dressing on the side.Everything was fresh and delish, down to the capers and butter lettuce.

We called Bros and they said 10-15 minutes so we put our name in. We arrived about 5 minutes later and was greeted by the hostess. She was very pleasant and checked seating and recalculated the time to 20 minutes. I gave her a little bit of a hard time, mostly comical, and she remained very sweet and pleasant. Then seated us within the original estimate. Now, where do I start? In case you don't finish reading this review I'm going to start with ... Many restaurants have good to great service but often fail in a single or insignificant way. Bros Brasserie had it PEGGED! The hostess very pleasant, polite and concerned about taking care of the customer. The waiter was ... now read this complete statement ... almost invisible but our drinks were right there, food on the table to hot to eat, empty plates disappeared without a trace (he didn't have to ask if we were finished because we licked the plates clean but I'll get back to that) the check appeared, when I placed the card with the bill the check was back ready for my signature what seemed instantly! That whole experience was fantastic, a poster child for customer service! NOW the food ... WOW, FANTASTIC, AWESOME, HOT, presentation was fantastic ... ok I'm starting to sound like I work there!! No I don't work there but I travel extensively and eat out a lot ... Bros Brasserie is in my top 5 restaurants ever.
