Great knowledgeable service. She guided us through the menu and presented specials with ease. You must have the cheese appetizer. Also the shrimp and grits app is great if you don't want to go for the entree size. I also had a mixed green salad with spiced pecans and bleu cheese crumbles. Perfect balance of flavors. This is a must stop on your visit to the area!"}, {"review_id": "dpNMVM9_kTiyEsc2VHUGlw", "user_id": "dhF-BtaM62hDPUXEqIAyMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "I loved the Blue Marlin. The ambiance was very calm and casual, yet still great for dressing up with nice company. There is available parking but can be limited, as it's shared with many businesses. On the weekends, parking is free, so it's definitely a place I'd limit to on the weekends. I don't remember what I ordered but it had oysters in it and was kind of like a chowder, quite possibly a oyster chowder... it was very thick but very tasteful. The service was great and very attentive. They have many options to choose from but is on the pricey side."}, {"review_id": "9m_R_bWV1QpL1uLNu9kcxg", "user_id": "U7oJPRC2HP7VRViNwDuHaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Classy casual seafood place.

Food was excellent and very high quality. I had a chicken and spinach dish while my boyfriend had a shrimp dish. The ambiance was very nice for date night. There were also several families seated nearby so it's not so sophisticated that older children aren't welcomed. Very nice for a date night or special occasion.

He eats fish on Friday, so this fit the bill for a Friday night supper. I made a reservation a few days before, which I recommend to everyone because they are super busy. We started with the calamari and the ahi tuna. Both were fantastic, but I was super impressed with the Ahi Tuna presentation. For our second course, Dad had a cup of she crab soup and a salad wedge, I had the southern candied pecan salad, and my SO had the BLT salad. All of it was so good. I would go back and just get the candied pecan salad. It was delicious.For my main, I had the blackened Rainbow trout with mashed sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts. It was amazing. My dad had a seafood platter and the SO had the Mahi Mahi. Everyone enjoyed their food. The service here is incredible and exceptionally attentive. The drinks are delightful and they have a very nice wine list. I definitely recommend Blue Marlin for a nice night out!"}, {"review_id": "x4abKpiu1nPEo_v3P7u2zw", "user_id": "Z3A7R4WjFvmCJ0kGBd87Vw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/13/2017", "text": "Wonderful and awesome are words to describe this place.

For appetizer we had firecracker shrimp. Very lightly breaded with a tad of spiciness. Served with cherry peppers for extra pizzazz. If it's too warm to your liking, you can tone it down by dipping in their homemade buttermilk ranch.Next course was a wedge salad. Not too big, nor too small--just the right amount before the main course. The wedge salad is served with homemade blue cheese dressing, lots of blue cheese crumbles, scrumptious pieces of bacon, cherry tomatoes, and pecans rounding a nice touch. The main course consisted of firecracker flounder. Similar to the light breading on the shrimp, this piece of fish was amazingly fresh and flaky. Served with southern style grits (polenta) which was tastefully creamy and absolutely amazing. Completing the sides was a generous portion of good 'ol fashioned collard greens. Probably some of the best I've had in a good long while.The staff are knowledgeable, courteous, and helpful. I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience."}, {"review_id": "4N-HSQ9bDnp28PLvcYzbUA", "user_id": "deeXR-R8-DiR8L7Hhdsmbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Every time I come here I have had a stellar meal.  The teriyaki salmon is phenomenal and the steak is great too.  It is slightly pricey, but worth it.  It can get really busy, so a reservation is recommended, but I've been never waited for too long to be seated if I didn't have one.  They are gluten free friendly as well."}, {"review_id": "bK7L6Vv2XGwZt5n700BBqQ", "user_id": "GSHhSvjGZ2P2q24GUygZvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/3/2017", "text": "This is one of my favorite seafood restaurants in Cola city!

Responsive, friendly waiter. They were also very understanding and accommodating when we showed up with 8 people when the reservation was for 4. Alas, the food was nothing special. I had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp were quite small, and the dish was a little too salty IMO. I have to say the portion size was HUGE though. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing.
