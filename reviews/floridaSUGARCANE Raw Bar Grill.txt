We sat outside when we came and it was a cool Miami night. Service was great. They have tapas which just means small plates to share so we got a couple of things to share. Our waiter was cool and even recited a poem for us because he said he was doing a mic night at a local club. So who can complain about dinner and a free show lolThe food speaks for itself. Super high quality and beautiful trendy spot. Can't wait to come back!Update 4/21/18:Was here over the weekend and wow I was completely disappointed. Drinks were completely watered down. Goat cheese croquettes were ok, but let's be real just basic. Octopus was sent back twice. Honey BBQ ribs were ok. The foie gras fried rice took forever and was disgusting. We took a couple of forks to it and everyone agreed...gross. The scallops were also meh. Beef carpaccio and the bone marrow were the only good plates. And let's not forget the torrejas. They did not disappoint thank God! Other than that I don't think I will be back."}, {"review_id": "ipYtKe5KecUNzwF2hQx2Fw", "user_id": "uWxsbnjfmFRZ_GnsFETbdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Well, i went here twice in one week... so it must be pretty good. First time i went was just to grab oysters and a drink or two with a friend. The bartender, Alex, was very attentive and good at suggesting pairing options. While there i found out about happy hour which is what led to my second visit. Happy hour during my second visit was a little but of a different experience. The bartender was very busy and not too attentive, not sure of her name. It's understandable because happy hour is busy, but it defeats the point of going if you're not getting service. I ordered oysters, 2 sushi rolls, edamame and Brussel sprouts (not all for me of course lol) but all the food was phenomenal! The drinks are very effective and they have Flor de Cana, a Nicaraguan rum that i love! If you want the inexpensive prices and the busy bar seem happy hour is your best bet. I would return for the great atmosphere and amazing food"}, {"review_id": "O49hYwDHEt2dzmrB1rJ2UQ", "user_id": "09X6cnOJnuNXi39yPxjHNg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "I have been going to this restaurant for 5 years. A key factor that kept me coming back was the bar staff, prompt, friendly and such excellent service. Over the years they've all left and I started going less and less. This past Saturday I came with a friend. We requested a table and while we waited, we ordered cocktails at the bar and two appetizers. When we got called up for our table, I told the hostess we had a tab and card at the bar, if she could kindly tell the bartender to run the card and for her to meet us at the table with it. She refused. She also didn't help us carry the drinks and waters we had at the table, which we couldn't fit into our hands. I didn't ask her, but typically in these situations and this type of restaurant (casual fine dining to fine dining), they try to make the transition from bar to table seemless and not inconvenience the guest with carrying their own dining items as if there are waiting on themselves. Especially if they are struggling due to how many items there are. They also either transfer the bar tab to the table or bring you the check to the table. Either way, it's seemless and stress-free. Instead, ours was stressful, chaotic and rather messy. There was nothing seemless about it. I am at the table while my friend is outside moving our drinks to the table and then he is at the bar trying to get the bartender's attention and close the tab. The hostess was walking empty handed while we were trying to get everything in our hands. We sat without menus, until our server brought them to us.Our experience improved at the table, though he was a little too pushy towards the end - You know, when it's close to closing time and they are rushing you out. The bathrooms  I had never seen an establishment of this type with such disgusting bathrooms. I went into one stool and it REEKED of pee, you could see it all around the stool. Paper all over the floor and a trash can filled to the top. I went into a different stool and it wasn't that much better. The trash can overflowing and papers all over the floor. No toilet paper in the dispenser. I had to search their cabinet for some. I didn't complain about the transition to the table, but this I couldn't let go of. I spoke to a manager and showed him the photos I just had taken. My friend didn't even go to the bathroom after seeing the photos. Makes you wonder, if the bathrooms are this way, how is the kitchen? Appalling. Food is very good, but food alone can't carry an establishment. I saw so many servers floating around doing nothing. Matter of fact, one went to the bathroom when I did, but he used the bathroom and left. The staff needs to care about what their bathrooms look like. P.S. The toilet paper is there just because I got it out of the cabinet."}, {"review_id": "igF5do71bw0jI5925Gm_RA", "user_id": "NVw5Tq2W_ovsWla8F1wbTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Another amazing restaurant in the Midtown. Some of the best spare ribs I have ever tasted are found here. Kimchi Beef tartare was out of this world and the presentation is amazing. Wife really enjoyed the goat cheese croquettes so much I didn't get a chance to try one. Her entree was the Duck and Waffle which I did try and found delicious. My only complaint was the duck Foie Gras fried rice because the Foie Gras was undercooked and I could've sent it back but we were starving that day so I just ate what was properly cooked. Still, the fried rice was delicious and flavorful so I won't take a star away for a minor technical execution. The waiter was super attentive and very helpful. Have to come back to try a few other items on the menu that sounded amazing. Overall, this is definitely a place I'd come back to in the future...good food and excellent service"}, {"review_id": "9S6IqJH0GSvgeZOuKzpghQ", "user_id": "Di9EXlFrFBfyPMNSmjycug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "You can't go wrong when you decide to come here...

I stayed at a place less than 10 minute drive away from this spot. I saw the great reviews and the # of reviews here (you rarely see 1000+ reviews for restaurants in Toronto).Super excited to come hear after a long day of sightseeing and travelling around. When I arrived, I realized that this place is pretty upscale and nice. Got me more excited to be seated and order everything off the menu. I got seated right away and was placed at a table near the center. Menu looked delicious and it was so hard to hold back the temptation of trying everything. I had a good look of the drink menu and the food menu couple times, maybe 5, 6 times, and my server finally came. I ordered my drink and thought, I'll get my food after my drink arrives. I relaxed, played on my phone, uploaded some photos and replied some messages..server is nowhere to be found. I checked when my first message was sent after I ordered my drink, and it has been a good 25 minutes. I spotted him on the other side of the restaurant and tried pretty hard to get his attention. He updated me that the sangria will come in just a second. If it's bomb sangria, I'm happy to wait for half an hour. 10 minutes later, sangria finally came. It was good, but not \"it was worth waiting 30+ min\" good. Finally ordered a bunch of food since I was starving. I had my fingers crossed hoping that food would not come too slowly. Well that didn't really help. First dish came about half an hour later, then one after another, 10-15 minutes apart...even though I finished each dish in about 2 minutes (that's how hungry I was). Despite that I was hungry enough to stuff just about anything edible in my mouth, the raw fish were warm....not delicious, not fresh, and not pleasant (Ordered a piece of every sashimi they had). Scallops and duck waffle were decent, and the bacon wrapped dates, i have to admit, were awesome. My entire meal lasted 3 hours, and I arrived when the restaurant was about 25% occupid.Great dates, but horrible experience."}, {"review_id": "YlZt1kr8qRexj2F6h7GX4A", "user_id": "rcYGwmcFd7ndKuUIawIS8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "Oh my, oh my... what a place.Here's my picks:short ribsYellow tail on crispy riceAvocado toast Skirt steakOysters And key lime....Wait, that beet mojito was yum yum too!Bon appetite!"}, {"review_id": "8IiDVxd3SZMT7yYn7SkJMQ", "user_id": "92XWqh3R8x8GSF1u_ZhFuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Sugar cane is one of my favorite restaurants in the midtown area.

I will say that although it may seem pricey the portions are great. If it's for two people 1-2 plates of each shouldSuffice. I love that this place is tapas! It's a great alternative than going to abnormal restaurant because you get to try everything you love in one night! For desert I had the Nutella ice cream and it was very yummy!

To start, it's hot in Miami, and I judge the service of the servers based on how attentive they are to our drinks and our server brought refills, topped off our waters, continuously made sure everything was good for us all without us having to ask. We were told that the restaurant is basically a market of three different kitchens each cooking up their own unique cuisines, so of course it only made sense to order something from each sections of the menu. I'm not going to list all the things we ordered, but two that stood out the most to me were the Duck and Waffle (MMM just thinking about it) and the Grilled Octopus.The Duck and Waffle was basically a fried egg over a roasted duck thigh over a soft but crispy Belgian waffle. It sounds so simple, but it tasted oh so good. The meat was perfectly soft and savory and paired perfectly with the sweetness of the waffle and syrup. DEFINITELY recommend. The second item was the grilled octopus. Now I'm definitely a fan of all seafood, but octopus is one that is tricky because there is such a thing as bad octopus. This dish was one big octopus tentacle on a skewer, grilled and seasoned, over a bed of greens. This wasn't your typical supermarket seafood section octopus, this was melt in your mouth octopus. Overall, definitely recommend coming to try SUGARCANE. Your wallet may leave bruising a bit, but your tummy will sure be happy!"}, {"review_id": "Y7SpTIXhfYuWmc9JhTJLrQ", "user_id": "zvQ7B3KZuFOX7pYLsOxhpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/27/2017", "text": "I visited Sugarcane on my last day of my Miami vacation with my friend. We were looking for a place to eat that was not too far from the Design District. Sugarcane has Tapas and Sushi it's definitely a unique menu. The place looks really nice and trendy. We came on a Sunday afternoon and there was no wait for seating.I'm honestly not a carbonara fan but for some reason it caught my attention on the menu and damn was it sooooo good! I highly highly recommend the carbonara! My friend ordered the salmon eggs benedict and we shared our food so I got to try that as well. The salmon benedict was alright. I could have done without it and just had the carbonara. I also ordered a cortadito with my meal since we don't really have that in California. This place was great. Our server was a bit shy but overall everything tasted amazing! It makes sense why this place is popular!
