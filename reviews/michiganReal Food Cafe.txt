Great atmosphere, phenomenal service, but the breakfast was uneven. The eggs were perfect, the bacon was good, but the home fries were cool-ordering-on-cold. My waitress (who was phenomenal) put in a new order right away. But the placement took a disappointingly long time. On the plus side: they use a dark rye, which in my opinion is the only rye. I'll probably be back, but I won't be in a hurry to do so."}, {"review_id": "IuLFTiK2YZ1yPibxQLO0Cg", "user_id": "XsTyD6e17T6RsRRWa4bUfw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Great food, decent prices.

The food was great, reasonably priced, and great service. It does get crowded, and is small inside, we had a party of seven and decided to split into two tables.  It would have been worth the wait either way.  I had the build your own omelette and it was very good and would recommend. They also make their own baked goods for sale at the counter; cinnamon roll, scones , muffin, etc. We got some of those to go.  A great breakfast place, worth the drive or if you happen to be in the area."}, {"review_id": "RV4nbT8RUoRWJ1qcjv2BhA", "user_id": "fxwVgmRTVoYtCmrkUJUlKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/1/2017", "text": "Nice, casual reprieve from the trendy, overpriced breakfast spots downtown. Very little wait at prime breakfast time on a Saturday, holiday weekend, no less.  You walk in and write down your name yourself. First come first serve for the bar. There were 4 groups ahead of us on the list and we waited less than 15 min. My husband got a breakfast burritito, which was huge and full of eggs, if you like that sort of thing. He loved it. My \"healthy\" waffle was covered in bananas and berries and vanilla yogurt and granola and it was freaking amazing. One of the best breakfast meals I've ever had. I always say it is worth the extra $2 for real maple. Coffee was unsurprisingly weak, as is the cafe way (quantity over quality)."}, {"review_id": "lJlyMr6uFWTGOpsB0PtEHA", "user_id": "p-TNByC-sV8yNmqT-9YQLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2017", "text": "A stellar place to eat - I've always gone to the location out on Plainfield but this day I managed to stick closer to home so I tried the Eastern location - and was not disappointed in my choice! While much smaller than the other location, the quality of the food was not at all diminished by the size of the building!The service is friendly and quick, and while you have to wait (especially on weekends) usually to get a seat, it's worth it. The food is fresh and plentiful (hint: Get a short stack of pancakes. They are HUGE!) and served hot and quick to you.Final note - as with the other location, they only take cash - but bring some extra to spend on the bakery case on the way out for some fabulous baked goods/cookies/cake!"}, {"review_id": "REZKFXVCaD4wzdk1KxohDg", "user_id": "J49KXc1Z1k1ZwQ1wRsIp8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Great Sunday breakfast!

I ordered the eggs benedict and it arrived luke warm at best. It came with home fries that were absolutely packed with onions. The menu did not mention onions and I hate them so half my meal was completely inedible. I got a side of bacon and it was cold and hard. Boyfriend ordered eggs, sausage, and pancakes. He said the pancakes tasted like crepes, his food was also cold, and the only thing that had any flavor was the onions in my home fries (which he ate for me). We each got a baked good to go when we checked out to have for breakfast tomorrow, but when I came home I found out they gave me a blueberry scone instead of the raspberry one I asked for. The less than impressive experience combined with the inconvenience of being cash only means we wont be returning here even though we live just 2 blocks away."}, {"review_id": "svSVerskr5-xptPbubtR5Q", "user_id": "u6uFLnNInzm6eiEC7tkn3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2016", "text": "1st off this restaurant is cash only!The atmosphere here is pretty normal. Plenty of light.I ordered 2 eggs scrambled, Canadian Bacon, home fries, and rye toast ($7). I also ordered a cinnamon roll ($3). How was it? Fantastic! How do you make eggs taste so great. The Canadian Bacon was very good and home fries (aka american fries) were outstanding. The rye toast was very dark, almost pumpernickel and was very good. The cinnamon roll to me was only above average, though others may love it.There service was very good and the food came extremely fast. The cooks must be wizards!Overall I give a solid 5 stars. I'm not normally a breakfast person but this meal was amazing. Will I be back? Yes, in fact the meal was so good I went back the next day!I ordered the Tuesday special (available anytime) ($6). Plus a side order of home fries ($3). The Tuesday special is 2 eggs (scrambled), 2 bacon or sausage (sausage patties- homemade), and 2 mini pancakes or 1 french toast (pancakes). Again eggs were spectacular and the sausage patties were very good. The pancakes were right up there with the best i've had. The side order of american fries was very large and just as great as the day before.The service was still great and food came wickedly fast again, even though they were busy. Yes it's still a 5. They won't let me rate higher. I love this place. Why did it take me so long to come here? It was so good I was going to go a 3rd morning straight, but I had to work late and was then too tired!The prices are very fair and food is amazingly good."}, {"review_id": "Zb-JiefE5GTns5P8tAZLBA", "user_id": "g6VFwHM_X8kFxSCYb1ISNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/2/2017", "text": "This place is the bomb!!

No available seating in the waiting area.  No logical place to stand without creating an obstacle for the servers (it's directly between the kitchen and the main dining room) made the wait really unpleasant.  I'm hoping they will start taking names and numbers and texting when tables are ready like they do at Anna's House. My experience would have been greatly improved by a more comfortable wait.  We were seated in the row of booths right next to the counter and cash register, in a corner.  On the bright side, we had a great view of the display case for the baked goods - the coconut cake and the cinnamon rolls look incredible.  However, we were also directly behind some kind of station for the servers and caused some interruptions to our meal.  Like, there was a \"caution - wet floors\" sign propped behind my chair that would fall over every time I moved.  There was also a silverware bin on the ledge behind me.  Twice, servers dropped rolls of silverware directly on me, without realizing it.  Even though I wouldn't take that seat again, I'll definitely keep returning because the food really does live up to the hype.  I ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast based on YELP recommendations and it was super good!  The portions were enormous, too - everyone in my group needed a takeout box for leftovers.    The note in the menu about the ninety minute time limit for dining made us feel a little rushed, but the food was good enough that I'll probably return - I'm just going to make more of an effort to beat the weekend rush!"}, {"review_id": "W7bwBSLJKXE5W8mA_849ww", "user_id": "UspHp-9FK2t0mXOj4V2-xQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "What can I say?  The northland scramble has redefined what a scramble should be.  I'm sad it took me so long to go back, but now it was a pleasant surprise to eat there again... incredible food, excellent service...
