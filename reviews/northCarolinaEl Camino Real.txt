Burrito was great!And i have to BRAGG about their MARGARITA.  they must hand squeeze the limes because it is the most fresh and amazing margaritas I've put in my mouth.  I've actually attested something similar in chapel hill \"Bar Taco\" and they charge $12 for a glass.  we got the whole pitcher for $17.   we will drive an hour to come to this place very soon. thank you for your existence! our family salute you!"}, {"review_id": "meBeDjcs2ZqCCkzw69LTvw", "user_id": "6_Kq5QeNvNDWYn70kGqnfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "Fabulous small Mexican restaurant but they deliver the flavor. The chips and salsa were delicious. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. I ordered the Chicken Chilaquiles on special with rice and beans. Flavors were phenomenal. Probably one of the better Mexican dishes I've had. I'm sad it was only a special and not a menu staple. My date had chimichangas and was very happy with his selection.

They are always spot on, the red and green sauces will lite your fire, and Hell, even the radishes taste a bit South of The Border. I ordered 4 tacos (they're small, don't judge) - Carne, Chorizo, Al Pastor, and Fish, and Sweet Alice ordered the unbeatable (seriously) Chicken Enchiladas with Verde Sauce, and of course, there were rice and beans involved! And of course, we munched on the excellent chips and salsa as we waited - bit chunky here, with plenty of cilantro, a touch of heat, and goodly supply of both chips and salsa. Does anyone else feel like they waaaay over eat on the salsa and chips, or is it just me? Alice said I should reminder her not to eat so much of the salsa and chips - yeah, like my insurance is that good!The food was out in good time, and the only boo boo was the Enchiladas were in corn tortillas - a bit irritating since we had a somewhat involved conversation on that request, flour please - No problem we were told, you'll love it we were told, SMDH!All in all, the food was exceptional, except for the corn tortillas and the soupyness of the beans, a spoon was required, or you had to swirl them into the rice, but we endeavored to persevere! The verde sauce, while a touch thin, explodes with a sharp, tomatillo driven flavor that is the essence of this dish. It helps that the shredded chicken (and it should always be shredded, NEVER chunked) is extremely well marinated, very tasty and tender!The tacos were awesome, and it didn't matter whether you applied the green sauce or the red sauce, in either case there was flavor and heat, and everything comes together for your pleasure and enjoyment - or in the extreme, you could go commando, go bare!We really like this restaurant, the food rarely fails to satisfy - my dream would be to pare the very best parts (service, food quality, parking, and ambiance) of El Camino Real, Santa Fe, Taqueria El Azteca, and Kiosco - think about it!"}, {"review_id": "qmIUl0zLww93jTptTfIDpg", "user_id": "7DL6B1jLIpqCtAvO5FMFmg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update...we've been here many times, but tonight was a poor choice. When we told the waiter that the salsa was metallic, he said noone else complained. Brought wrong sized drinks, the rellanos were actually tough and hard to cut(?), but the carnitas were fatty and there were more onions than pork on his plate. Staff was too busy and aloof. Only thing + was the creamy guac. Wasted $32 on bad Mexican food...yuck"}, {"review_id": "AYosqYxmQFAwyGD3ZNcrqA", "user_id": "puT28l8yK4a5xVcDEbKOGA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "6/2/2017", "text": "I had high hopes for this place, since I love tacos... I really tried to like it, but just ended up disappointed. At least it was cheap.Though it was great that we were served immediately, I thought the salsa served with the complementary chips was pretty bland. Moving onto what I ordered, I tried 3 tacos: Pastor (pineapple and pork, my go-to), Shrimp, and Carne (grilled steak). The pastor taco had no pineapple whatsoever, and the shrimp had that rubbery texture it gets when overcooked. The steak was barely there in dry, pebble-sized pieces. Even the tortilla was a fail for me - it was dense, doughy, and didn't bend well at all when I picked up my taco. More like a piece of stale bread. The atmosphere is very fun and festive, and the service is quick too. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things, but it'll be a while before I'll want to try this place again."}, {"review_id": "Zhe1HLoMXwA8gflRc1Tacg", "user_id": "yNU3bdoqiHzpFqKI7Rn15w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/11/2017", "text": "My friends and I were craving Mexican and when I searched for a restaurant on Yelp, El Camino Real was the first one to pop up!

Our table ordered the Burrito Texano, Pollo con Chipotle, and Pollo con Crema. For the amount we got, the prices were great. The portions were huge - couldn't finish it all in one sitting! I also saw that they had really good tacos, so I tried one al pastor taco and it was soooo good - my only regret was not ordering more! Quick service and attentive staff.

I've gone countless times and not once have I been disappointed with the food or service. The waiters and waitresses are always so nice and friendly, they remember you and welcome you back. The salsa is delicious with a nice hint of spice and a healthy dose of fresh cilantro. They always keep the chips flowing and make sure you don't have an empty basket. I really like margaronas and they know how to make them--the margarita isn't overly sweet like some places and they're huge! My boyfriend and I came to get some tacos before going to see a movie. He ordered 2 tripe, 2 chorizo, and 2 carnitas. I ordered 2 pastor, 1 chorizo, 1 chicken, 1 carnitas. The chorizo was so flavorful with the perfect amount of spice. The chicken wasn't dry like some places, but juicy and flavorful. The pastor (marinated pork and pineapple) was zesty and tangy. The carnitas weren't dry, but tender and tasty. The tripe, if you're into that kind of thing, was fried but still tender and bursts with flavor. If you like spicy food and the feeling of a good burn, their hot salsas are sure to make you sweat but add a whole new level of flavor to your dish. Seriously, this place is a must try!"}, {"review_id": "5oLO0T6xsEf0Sd6YZkij0w", "user_id": "amp5FMfIhwAE2T-Xmq7eMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "We stopped in our way home from Clyde to Durham.

I found it through ratings on Yelp and Google. I found the place fantastic.I have had both takeout and dine-in experiences here. The burrito I had for takeout was superior to most that you get in a small Mexican place.When I went for dine in one night I was greeted by pennants and soccer and happy people. The Pollo Crema is so fantastic I've had it twice, and always take home and additional serving because the portion is so generous. The salsa for the chips is so good I could eat it for chilled soup. It's made fresh and you can't beat it. I don't think I've had better anywhere.Decor? Cantina! Not extra fancy, but if you're on a date I think the good food makes up for the lack of romantic ambience. I think happy tummies make fantastic dates, myself.The service is outstanding. At first I thought it was one of those restaurants where you go up to the counter and order your food, but nothing could be further from the truth as I have had solicitous, attentive, and kind servers.

It was very flimsy, and every one of them fell apart in my hands!  Next, I split a steak torta with a friend and this was actually very good.The best part of the meal was easily the Horchata I ordered towards the end!  So good.  All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience and I'll most likely be back again.  I was just hoping for a little bit more based on some of these yelp reviews..."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-camino-real-greensboro?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
