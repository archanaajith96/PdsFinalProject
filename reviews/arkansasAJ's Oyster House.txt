We had great service and the food was awesome. The bar had a good amount of seats and everyone of them was full. The restaurant in itself isn't that big and the business seemed steady, so guess others agree with me! We started with fried zucchini. Yum. They came out fresh and hot. I had the Cat-Toufee, which was catfish (you could get Grilled, Fried or Blackened) on a bed of rice topped with crawfish etouffee. It also came with one side. $12. Also tried my friends crab cakes and they were delish, but rich. I would advise those as a shared appetizer. All in all...great meal. I'll def be back."}, {"review_id": "aiD_TW3loaxKTwdWPaiF0Q", "user_id": "fuslIq-ZJCd-qornjEokUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I've been to AJ's on multiple occasions and every time I go it's always good but I always feel like it could have been just a little better or the \"wow\" factor was missing.My visit this time was no different. The service was really good and the food was good as well, just not great.The entree's we had this visit were the crawfish étouffée and the blackened mahi-mahi fish taco's.Starting with the étouffée, it was good but not what I expected. It was a little more pasty then I normally See crawfish etouffee. The gravy was basically not existent. The dish actually had good flavor but I don't see myself ordering it again.The fish tacos were very good. The fish was cooked perfectly and the vegetables and sauces were nice and fresh. Overall, a good visit and I'm sure I'll be back again but it will probably be a while."}, {"review_id": "8_5vgEx9r3Ek4NW7rLV56w", "user_id": "Oln7RjqQqxGqyfuROhM0Nw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Nice little restaurant. Tables are a bit small which are at the front  and booths in the back seem bigger. Quickly greeted and a server came to ask for our drinks promptly. Our order consisted of a dozen oysters, catfish po'boy, and tater toufee. Oysters were nicely sized and fresh. Would come back for these oysters if visiting Fort Smith again. Catfish Poboy was your average Poboy. Not too heavy on the tartar sauce with a fair amount of lettuce with two tomatoes. Catfish was breaded and fried to a nice crisp. With only having a bite of the tater toufee, it wasn't too bad. For reason, we expected to see tator tots instead of an actual potato. Very different from our usual since we're from Texas. Great find with great food and service."}, {"review_id": "1Xn2oU8RydGb7bHsjRpbWw", "user_id": "Iteqq8OSIfC_S4YwscsHOw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Popped in for dinner and returned again for lunch soon after.

The shrimp and grits was plain. I made a comment and the waitress later returned saying she tried them and i was right. They doctored them up a bit and they were gtg.

A fine, refreshing Bloody Mary, great shrimp boiled and the crap cakes and banana pudding are righteous in their hype. Good salads, seem to know how to treat a steak and the fried green maters were a minor disappointment -- too hard in the center to consume but a great dill sauce.

Food was great, I had the shrimp and grits and My sister had the crab stuffed shrimp, both were great. I wasn't a huge fan of the potato cakes, but that's mostly because I don't like eating onions very often, so that's not on them. The only things I would complain about are that the location is super small so there isn't always enough seating, and because of the lack of staff it took a while to get our drinks. Which is odd for a Saturday night. But the staff that was there was super nice and attentive"}, {"review_id": "blUacg4jg55jjBiSGtygYA", "user_id": "mu0iJRlVwu7J3_c_V4HdUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/28/2017", "text": "We had shrimp po' boy and the crawfish po' boy.
