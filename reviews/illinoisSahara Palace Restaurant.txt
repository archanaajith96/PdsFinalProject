Yelp suggested Sahara Place.We were greeted by Mario (owner), who might just be the nicest person in Illinois.  He and the rest of the restaurant staff made our dinner feel like we had been welcomes into their home and were with old friends.The food... JUST AMAZING!  Excellent hummus and falafel.  The gyro and beef shawarma were great too... but the chicken shawarma was a knockout!If you're in the area, have the time (you don't want to be in a rush)... you really should stop in at Sahara Palace and enjoy.  Can't wait for our next visit."}, {"review_id": "TvTNzOVQbeNz-WbiBwPr2g", "user_id": "1k5VWW_zejFb8cYLNT8tew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "I am a devotee of Naf Naf Grill and in Rockford was missing comparable options. A friend suggested Sahara and I have to admit, i have a new favorite. The food is amazing, freshly made and popping with flavor. My first visit was with a number of coworkers who generally still eat with a toddler's palate (I say that with love). They were all hooked after our visit. While there, the owner took the time to stop by, make sure everything was good and to share some of history and the impetus behind opening the restaurant. Stop by, you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "Ak4zCtwqK6vDsNgdM0-eGg", "user_id": "JUsmQnXVuRdxkF4AGLscRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Wonderful food and great entertainment :-) We could tell that the owner obviously loves his job and loves people as he shared stories with us while we waited for our food. Once our Veggie Sampler Platter and Lentil soup arrived we knew his story about his wife preparing the food with Love was true. Her Baba Ghanoush was right at the top of my list of the best I've ever had, I like the smoky flavor and this was pretty close to perfect. The Falafel was cooked to perfection, no gooey centers to be found. Most Sampler Platters give only 2 or 3 small Falafel, but here, you get 4 large ones! In fact, the portions of everything on the plate made this a great economic deal. We throughly enjoyed our meals so much so that we ordered one to go for dinner tonight."}, {"review_id": "kE6anm13E5DaZn2QT8dBfQ", "user_id": "NpHuf1iuKZORey1Sal80TA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Fantastic food, great service, Rick is awesome and will make every visit memorable and a treat. My favorite is the tandoori chicken with hot and garlic sauce and extra onions. The falafels are a great appetizer too! The Arabic coffee is a treat after dinner, but Rick is the main attraction. Go see what a great dining experience is all about.

I was very nervous walking into the restaurant as we were the only customers... We were welcomed very warmly by the sole employee that was not cooking. He made sure to explain the menu, and told us that our happiness was of the utmost importance. He was extremely appreciative of our business. The food was excellent. We both really enjoyed our dishes and i would certainly return to this location."}, {"review_id": "p5mxtlYLcTPVdRQBWWx40Q", "user_id": "hwMuIw7vzDWgOrUPw1jofg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2017", "text": "Extremely welcoming!

We sampled a lot of options: hummos, falafel, shawarma, kabob, and tandoori chicken and honestly every bite was better than the last. To top it off, the service (by the owner) was exceptional. He was attentive, humorous, and kind.... but better still is that he did not JUST treat our table that way but every single person who walked in. This restaurant is not local to us but I would drive the hour to Rockford just to go here again."}, {"review_id": "nFnQIGsLPSbl8pdPTEITSA", "user_id": "MSSv040QTC0KxSjmzaGUJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Friendly and welcoming atmosphere!

Don't let its humble appearance deter you from trying it out. I've passed this place for years on my way in to Valli Produce, and finally gave them a try this past summer. I returned just yesterday with my mom, and once again enjoyed excellent food and service. I highly recommend the Jerusalem salad and any of the shawerma sandwiches, though I have a feeling you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The meat is perfectly seasoned (they use sumac as well! ), the sauces have great flavor and consistency, and the drinks are refreshingly delicious (we tried the herbal tea with fresh mint and Arabian latte with cardamom and cinnamon).The best part of visiting Sahara, however, is getting to chat with the charming owner. This place is family run, and you'll be welcomed in like a guest in their home. I certainly feel the love here, and will head here to get my middle eastern food fix whenever I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "N8K6LROiuYEJGwoYOqa8kg", "user_id": "BBJr-Z-rB4Ds0URC9gxJGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I've only been here once for lunch, but what I got was excellent, as I'm sure everything else is.

It was 0 degrees outside, but immediately, the owner warmed our hearts. We got carry out and enjoyed the chicken kabobs, beef kabobs, the kabob combo plate, a Greek salad and a large hummus plate. Everything was INCREDIBLE! The meat was tender and well-seasoned and the rice was perfectly cooked. Although, the table favorite was the hummus! When we picked up our food and met Rick, he made us feel as though we had come into a true home cooking kitchen. Every bit of food was made with love.
