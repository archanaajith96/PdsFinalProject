We have tried and failed throughout our journey across NM to find a gyro place as good as Santorini.What we usually get is the hummus plate (large) and a bunch of extra pitas. The hummus here is amazing. It comes with olives, cucumbers, and tomatoes, but my favorite thing about it is the oil thrown on top which mixes in with the hummus and tastes just... so good.We get the gyros or the mashowi (spelling?) plate for the main course. The lamb gyro is always freshly carved off the spit with fresh lettuce and tomatoes. You can get it with a side and I highly recommend fries to dip in the tzatziki or the greek salad. Both are amazing.The Greek mashowi plate has ~12oz of various meats; everything on this plate is amazing. When I do keto, I get this and just eat a greek salad on the side. My only complaint is that you can't substitute anything and I would so much rather have hummus than a pile of rice, but I usually just give that to my boyfriend.10/10, would give it an 11 if numbers worked that way."}, {"review_id": "wqf4JKNYfLSLkfud1yVmyQ", "user_id": "z4Bvefqd1bV7hwAuM7LJbw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Santorini is an island in Greece that is high up on the list. In Las Cruces, it's also a Greek restaurant. Spent a night in Las Cruces and checked out Santorini. I was shocked to see how dead Las Cruces is at night. Lots of restaurants close early and nobody was on the streets. For having a college campus in the city, I couldn't believe how much of a snoozefest it was. It was no surprise that we were the only people dining at Santorini. Two or three people came to order take out while we were there and that's it. I tried their pomegranate lemonade which tasted really weird. It had a milky taste to it which is bizarre for a lemonade. While I wasn't a fan of their homemade lemonade, we tried their souvlaki sandwich with fries. The souvlaki was seasoned well while the fries were a bit undercooked so they weren't the greatest. The portions weren't huge but you got a lot of bang for your buck for the price. Not a bad place to check out if you're a student."}, {"review_id": "syumLxLLL0us4dZ-OzqN4A", "user_id": "uuQdf646ZWGHCA509S5g0w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/7/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I had never been in here and after going for the first time I was not impressed. I ordered for myself and a friend and the waitress was great friendly and professional she made sure all was great but when I got it to the office it was another story. The vegetarian sampler had hair in it and so did the lamb it was gross.  We tried to switch to the cashew baklava but the dried out cake also had hair in it.  Very disappointed with the food.  When I attempted to fix it the manager on the phone had a horrid attitude and was very rude.  She was not helpful or willing to attempt to replace or refund anything.  Update. :( After posting my review the manager felt the need to respond on my yelp messages threatening me. STAY CLEAR FOR YOUR SAFETY. :("}, {"review_id": "vyVKvpu2PKNcOnXfd6wgOA", "user_id": "qCmiJjlkpnkWHy3daLwB1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My favorite restaurant in Las Cruces.  I eat here at least three time a week.  The hummus is out of the world!  The staff are very knowledgeable about menu and are extremely friendly.  This place is a hidden treasure.  YUM"}, {"review_id": "i9CHT2F0sOIEpghwX47cvA", "user_id": "vnVxxqmExsGBWYuEx08KQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "GOOD food - husband and I stopped here for dinner on a Friday night. We walked in maybe a half an hour before closing (yes, we were those people). The staff was very friendly, and service was great. We ordered a couple of different platters, aaaaaaaaand there were no leftovers. I don't have a huge appetite, but the yumminess of the food brought me to push the limits of my stomach. If I'm ever in Las Cruces again, this is a stop that is definitely on my list."}, {"review_id": "YzzHdH1MQixnvRQtUeftCg", "user_id": "HUI8Jqyh2RrrsbfeOovw_Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/20/2017", "text": "We spent an evening at Santorini with another couple on a Friday night as I had previously communicated with Santorini staff on Twitter and I had been wanting to enjoy some Greek cuisine for the past few weeks. We arrived early and sat at the bar in the restaurant, which has a very crisp and clean decor that is bright, fresh, and inviting. The staff was very attentive to our needs as we enjoyed a cider and beer while we waited for the other couple to arrive. Once everyone arrived and we sat down to eat, we began with the Vegetarian Platter, where we chose our three items that included hummus, baba ghanoush, and tzatziki sauce with pita bread. All three dips were fresh, tasty, smooth, and a real joy to consume. That could have been the entire meal, actually, if we had ordered it again. For the main course, though, I had the lamb gyro as I love gyros and had to try it as this was my first time at Santorini. Overall, it is very satisfying and tasty. The lamb was tender and cooked perfectly, the veggies in the pita were typical of a gyro (lettuce, tomato, onions), and the tzatziki sauce had a nice flavor, maybe a bit understated, but still very enjoyable. In summary, we will definitely dine here again. If you're in the mood for Greek or Lebanese cuisine, this is a great place to visit in Las Cruces, New Mexico."}, {"review_id": "EeaQJBxYOOJKlMTK6D9JpA", "user_id": "gmVutWbOQ_AceyA0gjLPHA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/16/2017", "text": "So I saw the reviews for this place looked pretty good so I figured why not. I wanted the vegetarian combo platter which looked great in the pics that were posted. I had a great waitress who was very pleasant and as I finished the veggie combo platter I thought I would have a dessert. The waitress mentioned the \"Mahgli\" which was a cinnamon rice flour pudding that was supposed to have coconut and mixed nuts on it. So I told her I would try it and when she brought it it had a dried layer of pudding on the top as if it sat in a refrigerator and dried up a bit. It also did not taste fresh and was very cold. But what was really surprising was that it tasted almost identical to a cinnamon cream of wheat. Also the nuts that were sprinkled on top were all one kind of nut and there was no coconut whatsoever. So I tried to choke it down and maybe got halfway through it and told the waitress that it truly was inedible. She took it and I ordered the Baklava. I ate it and it was normal Baklava, not like the kind I find in Cleveland but edible. When I got the bill the owner insisted that I pay for that nasty dessert because I ate half of it. I could hear him yelling in the kitchen over a $2.29 dessert!!! This is the first time I have ever encountered this much drama over a $2.29 food item. Actually this is the first time I have ever been charged for inedible food. The guy in the kitchen needs to learn some customer service and keep his mouth shut as far as I'm concerned if he wants to keep customers.Oh and they were also out of falafel which I see is a common occurrence with this place. Seems the old bait and switch is in effect here."}, {"review_id": "HDSJcQEHlyWIdZ6X3CEhxg", "user_id": "CGEEmG1Qvf2hGPD-apESiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "It is simply extraordinary.
