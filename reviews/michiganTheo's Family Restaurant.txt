My kiddo was hungry as we were heading to Lowe's so this was all that was around. 5 and change for a \"big\" breakfast. 2 eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, ham, pineapple, and toast. Easy enough! It was out super fast, but of course we had to wait a few extra minutes for French fries at 9am.. It was quick, easy, and we were in and out in no time. Our waitress was super sweet as well."}, {"review_id": "g7ATwO19O754cj1d_Z24FA", "user_id": "RYWUUAz02uUxh49lSmLJKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "Perfect for what it is: a diner!The booth was comfy and our sunny window had an individual adjustable shade. The extensive menu included Greek, American and Polish options as well as salads and desserts. Between us, my dining companion and I enjoyed a double mushroom burger with fries, potato and cheese pirogies, rice pudding and a salad with house-made Greek dressing. Everything was good and our bill was just over $20 with 2 beverages. The service was attentive and friendly and incredibly fast, our food was out within 10 minutes. It was especially impressive considering we were there over the lunch hour. I only visit the area once or twice a year, otherwise I would be a regular."}, {"review_id": "1pSScOSvFktptPppLfphWQ", "user_id": "Q__Rk5HzNY6sOtLjUiGEbA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/16/2016", "text": "This place was good. When we got there, the place was packed. We were greeted with a smile and we were brought to a table instantly. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. We placed our order and with in minutes received our food. I had the Theo burger. It's a half pound bacon burger with all the fixens. I was very satisfied with this burger. Was it blow your mind good? NO, but it was so much better then that nasty a$$ burger I had andreas garden. This place is priced well and overall it was an enjoyable experience. I will be back here in the future."}, {"review_id": "HK2hSPkFdF32rL0YLLAEBw", "user_id": "eP5InOraaMgBMJkoVsRV4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I've been coming to Theo's for as long as I can remember.

Robert Irvine would knock your block off for that. I have to take a star off my rating for that.Clearly a popular and busy place, it's definitely more casual than your regular restaurant in terms of the service and quality of food. Prices do reflect that though, and I got the breakfast special with pancakes for $6.25. Overall the food was good for the price, but I would prefer the pop glasses with only one refill to be larger."}, {"review_id": "Sc4WIh21mxopPHWSyDv9jQ", "user_id": "Ttisi60hZXQL15I7Tvjd-A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "My husband and I had breakfast here, the food was really good.

Amazing quality home-cooked style meals and they offer plenty of Greek favorites!I've had saganaki at tons of restaurants in the area, and out of town, and made some at home. My favorite saganaki EVER is at Theo's! They use the right cheese and they fry it the right way. Not to mention they butter and grill their pita bread before they serve it...yum!Decent size restaurant, Theo's is great for anything - breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and dessert!

But their menu has EVERYTHING you can imagine from stir fry to stuffed cabbages to soups. And sandwiches so everyone is healthy. Also it's really CHEAP. Really cheap! Family of five got five entrees each with soup or salad and five drinks and the bill after 20% tip was $45!!! Staff was somewhat friendly. Very crowded on a Monday at one pm and they seemed to prefer their regulars to us.In short, okay good for super cheap with tons of variety."}, {"review_id": "G6FK1jj5Jnt3xBdlld5elg", "user_id": "jDw9AMtPARWm0PB0ujbNYA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2017", "text": "The drinks come in a glass very small and on top of that you only get 1 free refill.
