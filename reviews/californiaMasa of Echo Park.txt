Our first house was just off Sunset. Then we moved a block south of the 101 but still considered Echo Park.  Whenever I hear old songs playing I can remember exactly what I was doing in and around Echo Park.  Then our Dad moved us away to the country because the neighborhood was turning.  In college, I had a friend who lived in neighboring Silver Lake. In the late 80s, the area wasn't hipster yet, but it was on the verge.  Never did I imagine Echo Park would become part of the hipster reinvention.We decided on Masa based on Yelp reviews. I didn't know it had a huge rep and following. We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of food and reasonable prices.  Their garlic bread and mozzarella sticks were light and flavorful.  Their pizzas were awesome.  I had the Elysian Park which was full of different meats and jalapeños. I had a taste of the spaghetti with meatballs. The sauce was awesome. The lasagna was pretty good.  Our server Chris kept us happy, hydrated and well-fed.  Since we were a large group, we sat in the back amongst two other big groups who were super loud. Like unnecessarily loud. That was the only unpleasant thing I can say. I was taking respite on the hallway bench near the bathrooms and some guy asked me if we were sitting next to the loud groups.  Yep. Can't wait to come back and try other stuff on the menus."}, {"review_id": "kmaA8sLoqSuGzFO2Z07O9A", "user_id": "wrEuQx6kJSItBL8Sy_9-Ug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "It was delicious!!

Unfortunately, the idea of circling endlessly for a parking spot and waiting hours for a table... on top on my husband not loving deep dish?! = no go. Not until my bff suggested a girl dinner date at Masa. For my bff, I would circle and wait eternally for her. Luckily we scored a parking spot right in front of the restaurant as soon as we arrived and our wait for two on a Friday night was only 15 mins! Just enough time for us to put in our deep dish order! While we waited for our deep dish, we shared their gnocchi with house-made bread. The gnocchi was very garlicky. A little overwhelming actually- tasted a little burnt. But the gnocchi pasta themselves were very pillowy and delish. Wished they held back the garlic or mixed it up with another sauce. The bread was warm and fluffy, and had a hint of sweetness. I had to remind myself to save stomach for the deep dish. I would had been perfectly happy eating the bread by itself. Traditional deep dish - we ordered the small but only had the stomach to conquer one slice per person. The cornmeal crust had an odd bitter aftertaste. The tomato sauce was sweet (which I enjoyed) but too runny. The sausage was a little dry to be honest. The cheese was the best part but cooled off soon after. It was an okay deep dish but not one I would crave. Already in my carb and cheese coma, my bff mentioned the bread puddings were not to be missed. So I unbuckled my pants and powered on. Their bread pudding was meant to be shared by at least 3+ (I hope). So rich, so decadent, so buttery, so I couldn't take more than 2 bites right now.  Wished I didn't go so hard on the gnocchi and bread earlier. Overall - The food was plentiful and the service was outstanding.

Starting from the ease of nearby street parking, followed by a zero wait time for dinner, and quaint neighborhood Italian American decor, I was already pleased! Our attentive server recommended we put in the order for pizza quickly due to the 40 min cook time on a deep dish pie and that's exactly what we did! As we ate our 3 \"Suppli\" or Arancini/rice balls (they were creamy and tasted great with the oozy cheese inside but some of the rice was undercooked making it a little hard) with a delicious marinara dipping sauce and sipped on some wine, we waited impatiently for that first bite of pizza scrumptiousness. And that's exactly what we got! A HUGE a$$ pie (medium) for two people lasts for days! Not joking, I ate pizza for three days after this! The veggie (mushrooms and black olives plus roasted garlic) pie was very good. It was packed with fresh, light, homemade tasting red marinara sauce, with large, chunky tomato pieces adding a subtle sweetness to each bite. I do wish the roasted garlic would have been chopped pieces versus whole cloves. The crust, which is usually my least favorite part of a deep dish slice, was different but still yummy. It kind of tasted like a cross between the flakiness of a pastelito, the butteriness of a croissant, and the crunch of pan pizza. It sounds weird but it worked so well! I don't recommend ordering carbs as your appetizer because you'll feel the overload with just a couple bites into the pizza. If I am in the area again, I'll get something much lighter to start...BUT... I'll save space for the bread pudding which looks delicious and I'll end up feeling just as full with a carb baby, but at least I'll be happy!"}, {"review_id": "WB84tRMUGMGN6w_0jLVIxQ", "user_id": "Oye9x7S8J6Wy7n0Zo4haBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Just came back again.. it's been a long time since I've been here and the food wowed me again!

Service: one star Very friendly waiters and definitely not that LA rudeness that we see in many restaurants. The staff is very attentive and caring. It is almost like a family run feel to it. Ambiance/ decor: one star It is a very casual restaurant. Love the decor-- that antique feel to it. Very unique than what we see in Many new restaurants with that modern feel to it.

We ordered in advance and our pizzas were ready a few minutes after we arrived. That's the way to go if you're going with a large group with a time limit.The pizzas were good but they lacked the special something I need to give a place like this more than 3 stars. The interior felt very... old. The decor and dusty faux flowers on the table made the germaphobe in me cringe a bit. So did the plastic table covers. I understand the potential charm in the eclectic design but I don't necessarily want to eat amongst dusty things.All three pizzas had thick cornmeal crusts - the bottoms of which were thin and undercooked? The blanket of sausage was yummy and their sauce is really delicious. The lots of meat was basically sausage and pepperoni. I didn't have it, but I somehow imagined loads more meats. I liked the traditional the best because of the mushrooms. I wished the toppings were a little heavier but it's because I like having a bit of each ingredient in every bite.I've had Chicago deep dish so I now how 2 California versions to compare to. I have to say Chicago wins.1. Pre-order 20 minutes ahead to get hot pizzas when you arrive2.

And trust me I'm the type with many questions. I ordered the deep dish create your own with blackened chicken. Bomb.. the marinara sauce is thick not runny, and flavorful with chunks of tomato. Bread is cooked to perfection still somewhat soft in the middle with crunch on the outside. The Caesar salad was real fresh with slabs of Parmesan cheese different but good. Mozzarella sticks were good breaded with a seasoning that worked and went well with the marinara sauce. I always judge a place not only by this but their ranch takes a big part in my food. Mass's Ranch was good went well with the pizza and sticks. Parking lot behind the restaurant. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was not able to dine in.

Only qualm was the humorous size of the wine they brought to the table. It was in a small juice class (which is similar to that in Italy) but the ounces didn't even look to be 6, maybe 4 oz?

I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did!I definitely recommend calling to place your deep dish pizza order in advance! We ordered about 15 minutes before arriving at the restaurant, which wasn't too busy at around 5PM on a Friday, and still waited about 30 min after we got there. It was me and my partner, and we got a medium, which is about 8 slices - perfect for leftovers for lunch tomorrow! We got the traditional Chicago deep dish and the pizza was SO good! It's definitely reminiscent of Chicago pizza, but it's not exactly the same which is totally fine. It's unfair to knock off points for not being exact - it's definitely delicious in its own right.  All the flavors were definitely there. The only things I would've liked are 1) a crispier crust (this one is doughier than I prefer), and 2) sausage bits in the pizza instead of a small patty on top of each slice. Otherwise, the crust was super buttery and everything else was really good.Also, the croissant bread pudding was AMAZING. Wow. It was so buttery and melted in your mouth. It's bigger than I was anticipating, so definitely share if you're not too full from pizza.Being homesick for Chicago has made this find even more special.

I liked the cheese paired with the apples, dates and walnuts. Though it did need a squeeze of lemon to zest it up a bit.

Best bang for the buck for a DDP There is a few flaws though but they are not too big of a deal. Here are the flaws - It does take about 40-50 minutes to bake the pizza.. I definitely suggest ordering ahead or else you will be waiting - Parking is truly crazy here in Echo Park as the main park is down the street. - Sometimes they won't let you order ahead and dine in.. they will force you to take out which kinda sucks because you don't want to wait that long.

Love that.I made no friends as we entered because i made a bee-line to the bar assuming there was a bartender there that would serve us but here there isn't and all of the servers take turns serving those who sit at the bar. Restaurant Faux-pas. We were lucky enough to have Kelsi help us: she is a nice, efficient, personable young woman who was not in the least put off by we two Boomers chatting with and to her about any number of subjects.We also chatted up Dominic who i'm surmising was a combo employee: busser, server helper extraordinare. The employees here are first rate: all at the ready to give good service with a smile. I appreciate that.Parking was no problem today but i would bet that parking later in the day will give you the willies. But find parking as you will,  this place is worth it for the most part. We dug right onto the menu and ordered up:Artichoke dip with a Cuban RollCaesar SaladSmall Deep Dish Pizza with SausageGarlic Toast with Marinara Dipping SauceCoffeeCroissant Bread PuddingFirst off: the Cuban Roll is super delicious: light, substantial, tasting of lard. The real deal. This is the bread that is also used to toast in the Garlic Toast.The problem with this preparation (Artichoke Dip) is that there just isn't enough dip. Maybe 2-3 dip sized bites for the big, fat cuban roll? The dip itself was a good if un-traditional: flavored with peppers and not as creamy as it should be.  I am more than willing to spread my wings and fly with another version of Artichoke Dip but again my complaint is that there is just not enough of it. Odd. As others on Yelp have noted the preparation of the Caesar is a lot off center. But in my book, a Caesar is all about the dressing. And the dressing here was delicious: all lemony, and garlicky with a slight fishy taste obviously made in house.But the deconstructed preparation put me off: thickish slices of parmesan, slices of bacon (???)? Sorry i wasn't buying into this at all. We used the slices of parmesan with the leftover Cuban Roll from the artichoke dip to make a sammy.  That Caesar Cardini is probably rolling over in his grave about this preparation is not the issue here. I am all for innovation that works. This doesn't.The toasted Cuban Roll with parm and fresh garlic and marinara is a good preparation but you're liking this would depend on how much you enjoy basically raw garlic. We did so this was a good item.And then the main event: the basic sausage Deep Dish. So much of the success of any pizza has to do with the dough and Masa Echo Park does it right. The dough is slightly sweet, very yeasty with the slight taste of good quality olive oil.  It is a perfect foil for the mozzarella and the super excellent sausage which was not in the form of rabbit droppings as in most pizzas but crunchy slabs: a very nice and innovative way of dealing with a pizza topping. I have had Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago a number of times and Masa's can stand proudly right next to those.The Croissant Bread Pudding is also a success: buttery, light Croissant with a maply caramel. eggy sauce. Also: Good Stuff!I have to say something about the excellence of the Coffee here: Kelsi told me that they use Jones Roasters Beans here which surprised me because the coffee here is better than that served at the Jones store in Pasadena.A note on pricing: except for the Artichoke Dip, all that we ordered was reasonably priced. A plus for sure.All in all a good, fun visit to Masa. I will be back.
