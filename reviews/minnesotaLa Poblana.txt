I'll give them that the service was indeed very good.  That said, my wife and I both found the food to be \"meh\".  As we'd never been there, I asked for menu recommendations and we were told that the enchiladas Rojas was their award winning specialty. My wife had chicken and I ordered 2 chicken and 2 carnitas. Well, the chips were good and we thought the salsa was pretty decent but the entrees were, at best, lacking. My wife and I love Mexican food and have tried many restaurants across the US and beyond. Honestly, we both found it to be just plain disappointing. The enchiladas were dry, as was the filling, the rice was nicely colored but pretty tasteless. We did really like the refried beans. We also thought the portions were pretty small compared with other places. It just wasn't our thing..."}, {"review_id": "qxmSZmRr63utzfUJ7MdAaQ", "user_id": "iOIVkS-xEpYnLQyRWFB6Xg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/14/2017", "text": "Finding authentic Mexican anywhere in Minnesota can be difficult, especially in Southeastern MN. After reading all the positive reviews and per the recommendation of my friend, we decided to check out this restaurant. It is a seat yourself, sit down restaurant, that offers a retail side as well as beer in the restaurant area. Great decoration on the inside and overall setup is good. Now onto the food: the menu is loaded with items I wanted to try. We started with the chips and salsa (included) and ordered up a horchata. The horchata was good and filling. The chips were fresh and crispy and salsa was above average. For the entree, ordered the Taco Lunch. This included 3 tacos, beans, guac, and rice. The tacos were very filling, fresh, and the corn shells were delicious. The food received a 5 star in my book. Wanting to try the Steak next round. The service was above average, but I downgraded overall review due to no refills on water or a check-in on how our meal tasted. Tough review on my part, I know. Overall, I was very impressed and will be back to this location again to try other menu items."}, {"review_id": "nAI3B4uXzUlSX5dWP5bI0A", "user_id": "A58soS5_HC1IFLPnW2aaog", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "We had high expectations for La Poblana, as it was ranked Number One on Yelp and after seeing it was voted best Mexican restaurant in Rochester. The quality and flavor of the food was great, all the different cut of meat were tasty but there wasn't much for volume here. For the price we paid we were expecting more food. This is a restaurant in a strip mall not a fine dining restaurant.

Really disappointing. I ordered a taco plate with Carnitas. Sad, little plate, grisly dry pork and tiny serving of  maybe a quarter cup each of rice and beans and a scant tablespoon of guacamole.  My girlfriend ordered chili relleno platter and this came with the same miniscule sides if rice, beans and guacamole. Our food bill was $25. What a rip off! When we asked about the serving size of the rice and beans our waitress got rude and told us we were not getting any discount. We were not asking for one, as I had already paid her for our bill anyway. Ridiculous servings, prices and service with an attitude. Needless to say we won't ever be patronizing La Poblana."}, {"review_id": "QepBDKghvAh2udE8m3t2Aw", "user_id": "W3_blNjAje8GIX7wRdCgwQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/12/2016", "text": "La Poblana is the most authentic Mexican restaurant in Rochester! I've tried tacos at many restaurants in Rochester but they have too much cheese in it and lack the authentic flavor. La Poblana has a relatively short and concise menu but they stand up to offering quality. The service is quick, food isn't that expensive ($10-13 per person) and they even have some grocery items. I ordered the taco platter with chicken and was amazed by the portion size. I will definitely go back.P.S.

I haven't tried the other one yet, but this was probably the most authentic Mexican I've had since being in Florida (from there originally). The portion sizes are gigantic and the prices are reasonable for what you get.Stepping into the place you're not really sure if you're in a grocery store or restaurant, as there is a whole wall full of stuff you can buy. That is actually a great idea in my mind! The dining hall doesn't seem like much but the service was good throughout the time. It would have been better if the waiter refilled my water.I got the Combo La Poblana, which was carne asada with four chicken fajitas. The carne asada was decent with enough flavor on its own, but I am used to more lime and cilantro that keep the beef from being too dry. The fajitas were excellent, stuffed full of chicken - although the chicken was unseasoned. The portions were huge and I ended up taking two fajitas home.Note they do charge for the chips and dip. That is not something they tell you up front. But given how far north of Mexico we are in Rochester, it was surprising to have some truly authentic cuisine."}, {"review_id": "GVZA3vc1pUWL9DjkNbGnMw", "user_id": "d2P5CJeY6jK85mZEFDW6nw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/21/2016", "text": "This is like, legit Mexican food.
