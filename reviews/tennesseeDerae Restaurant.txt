Seriously, mention Derae and faces light up! I now totally understand why.The owner is incredibly friendly and insists on ordering for you. I was a bit nervous because I am a vegetarian, but he assured me that I would leave happy and stuffed. I did. I really did. I shared the veggie combination, fuul with a baguette, and some deep fried vegetable ball goodness that I can't remember the name of at the moment. The veggie combo was easily enough for four people. We ate until defeat and took the rest with us. Oh, and don't even get me started on the fuul - so good! I could seriously eat a bowl of it every day with the baguette.  The owner brought out the fried veggie balls for us to sample and they were heavenly. I love spice and these things were absolutely packed with flavor!I can't rave enough about the food. Everything looked, smelled, and tasted so good that I only snapped one pic of the veggie combo. Whoops! No worries, I'll be back soon."}, {"review_id": "lV5s0EdIcSNDRpqwi6I8nw", "user_id": "itlprrMMFTDcUbo-xWAtWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2017", "text": "Finally able to check this place out! It surpassed all of my expectations. It's just a tiny whole in the wall, but those are usually the best!Muhammad, I'm assuming the owner was fantastic! Very warm and friendly and quickly let us know that he cooks what he wants...and I didn't mind! He cooked us two plates to share: a chicken and rice and goat and rice dish. The flavor was out of this world! The meat seemed good quality and cooked perfectly, just enough spice to keep you awake, but not enough to make you regret it! And the portion sizes were huge! We finished them up for dinner! He gave us salad, vegetable soup and a falafel and beef appetizer plate. Wonderful experience and I WILL be back again soon!"}, {"review_id": "ug2hLiQzPqdj2hrbXnZ7nA", "user_id": "yiluhcH0PFHZWxsAS0F_GQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/29/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We were here in Memphis again tuning away from Harvey and we had to visit Derae Restaurant.This time not only lunch we started with breakfast and went back for lunch as well.We enjoyed both the Fuul and Fatima for breakfast and we had Hamid and Rice for lunch and beef sambusa for appetizer."}, {"review_id": "zsOPIRoeObX_Y8bPqZaEvw", "user_id": "JzTn8yTdb3HEhCMiWeX6mA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "Outstanding place to eat!

The location is right off Park and Highland. A little hole in the wall joint but serves some amazing food.The owner was very nice and we didn't know what to order. As he asked questions on any food allergy we had to what we liked and disliked, he knew what was fit for us to eat. He suggested bringing out some samples and guaranteed it would be tasty, but if we didn't like it we would not have to pay for it. I mean come on now, that is customer service and backing up your food quality and reputation!Everything we had was very tasty of course. We had several items: Hanid and Rice, Chicken and rice, Veggie Combo, Sambusa and Fuul (Fafa beans, onions, scrambled eggs, green onions and spice). My favorite has got to be the Chicken and rice and apparently alot of others as well. If you just come in to eat one item i would suggest this. The Sambusa and Fuul has made it into Commercial Appeal's 100 things to eat in Memphis before you die.commercialappeal.com/ent…I'm so glad we did this as a group, it allowed us to try several items at once without over ordering. #Yelp901"}, {"review_id": "OXZCjQZlNMinl1X6eoCuAw", "user_id": "NL4c8tkoE0zOYyifLRP8bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "Mohamed is awesome!This food is outrageous !!

Happy customers. Number 1 in the city! I have never had Ethiopian food in my life. I've always been curious, but never risked putting my life on the line. I think Mediterranean food is gyros. Outside of that, I don't know anything about this food or the culture. I kind of expected a few starving children to be there. I kept looking up at the ceiling expecting a food drop any minute. That shows how dumb I am. But seriously folks, the menu is very short and simple but my co-worker and I still had no idea what to order. We were about to play the guessing game when Muhammad came to the rescue. We just decided to let him order for us and he suggested the two of us share two dishes. Sometimes eating solo is to your disadvantage. He brought out a goat and rice dish and a lamb and bread dish. He showed us how to tear the bread and use the bread to grab some of the meat. This is the first time in my life someone has served our table and ate the first bite in front of us! I thought it was funny as hell and it's a great way to ensure quality control! Muhammad is such a super cool guy and his English seems perfect. There is no language barrier at all. He made the experience really go above and beyond. He is from Ethiopia so him and his wife know what they are doing. We ordered the food spicy to begin with and he brought out a green pepper sauce that was probably fresh peppers ground in a processor. He warned us with great enthusiasm to be careful with it. I thought we were gonna have to sign some legal paperwork before he'd let us eat, but that's kind of like a dare to me. If you build it up that much, I can't chicken out! Not one little bit of the sauce or any peppers were left behind. I'll write an update tomorrow if it burns real bad after I'm done with it, but I think I'll be ok. Muhammad is proud of his Yelp. Some owners hate it and act like every one is out to get them. He embraces it because he knows it can help him! 98 reviews now, 5 stars! That's just unheard of. Just last week Yelp awarded him the number one spot of best places to eat in Memphis! Number one guys! If that's not reason enough to try a new food, then I don't know what is! As for the food itself, the meat was flavorful and tender. It kinda reminds me of Indian curry meats I've had except the rice is like vermicelli and the bread is different. If I was gonna offer some feed back, it would be that I expected a little more meat. But I've decided not to mention that. Bottled water is included. 10% discount to check into Yelp. I'll close by saying my lunch partner is never impressed with anywhere we eat. He is not a yelper, but he always tells me to give one star less than I was thinking. Nobody can ever please him, and he was craving it so bad, he said he wanted both meals again to take home to his wife for dinner! Way to go Muhammad for making us leave happy!9/13/16Today a friend and I came in a little early and we told Mohammed to serve us whatever he wanted and we asked for a third thing and he brought us a fourth! The food kept coming and some went home. We never needed the menu. He is such a cool guy and his food (and his Fuul) is incredible. And yes, he knows it! He got on to me for saying this tastes like this and that tastes like that. Lol! More than just a meal. It's an experience!
