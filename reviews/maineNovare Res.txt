Upon visiting Novare Res again it's important to retract that statement and add that if there were a 6 star feature, Novare Res would deserve it, simply for getting the little things right.Novare Res has two experiences: The outdoor 'bier cafe' which is like a beautiful secret garden in the middle of Old Port where you can relax, have some nice beers outdoors, and enjoy your time. It takes you out of the hustle of the city and into a green paradise, and the beer selection is nothing short of wonderful. There is a diversity of tastes, but no diversity of quality - everything is just excellent.The indoor portion of Novare Res is an extremely comfortable place as well. There are beer hall-style tables indoors, games such as jenga, and a large L-shaped bar that afford plenty of space for the many barkeeps to serve and for patrons to get served, which is great. The inside doesn't seat too many people, but there's a lovely coziness and community feel to it which really works well.What separates Novare Res from all other establishments is their amazing curation of an impeccable beer list and their willingness and insistence to get it right. This is one of the few establishments outside Düsseldorf, Germany that serves the traditional Düsseldorf Altbier style. While it is by no means a must-have beer, the fact that they have it ready and available and can speak to its history with passion and authority indicates something genuine about their business. They also keep genuine Kölsch glasses on-hand and serve several styles of Kölsch in those glasses. The Kölsch-style is a forgettable beer unless served properly in a Kölsch glass, and it changes an otherwise bland experience into a genuine experience worth Yelping about. As someone who has gotten about a dozen weird looks when asking if a restaurant that serves Kölsch has the glassware, the fact that it took less than a second to pull out a Kölsch glass after my inquiry is one of the greatest beer-drinking experiences a patron could ask for. 10/10 would recommend."}, {"review_id": "ZiEeVW4UfmpQdWvZsHjfHw", "user_id": "XZ4ZS38YJqZaj718w0UOlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "There are a lot of breweries and tasting rooms to visit in Portland, this place should deff be on your list. Cool vibe - open space, not out of lighting. There was a huge outdoor area but unfortunately it was winter so we couldn't take advantage. Had lot of different kings of beers on tap. Each was listed in a binded book with witty descriptions for each brew. There was a decent gluten free selection as well as cinders. Good menu options. I tried the oysters - thumbs up. They were served on a bed of sea salt with cocktail sauce and lemon. Only downside was it smelled kinda funky - nothing to deter you from staying!"}, {"review_id": "O8wwvtZqTch1xt5rYMl74g", "user_id": "9OATPfIjbwRwn_IPO9nN5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "It was way too cold and full of snow for us to enjoy their seemingly gorgeous outdoor area, but we still had a great time indoors. They have an impressive beer selection (also cider and mead) and offer taster sizes on most of them. We ended up with a few of those since we are visitors to Maine and wanted to focus on trying local brews.It was a little challenging finding adequate seats for our group, but fortunately, after about 5-10 minutes of looking like lost puppies, a group left their seats and we immediately snatched them. It also does get a little loud inside in the main area, which means lots of yelling if you'd like to have a conversation.Definitely a worthy stop if you're looking to have a few craft beers."}, {"review_id": "VPXWBIwRC-v41YaewCzmJA", "user_id": "LwIFzQnVu1RGWBTSl34OkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Location was fuller than most others nearby when I went which appears to show that locals have a preference for it.

We decided to sit in the patio since it's kinda chilly out. Get ready to be amazed by the collection of their vintage beer, dated back to 2009. Regular beer on draft is great too. I've got Tropical Storm and Atlantic-Style Vintage Ale, and they're both true to their style. Food is good as well. We ordered Deviled Eggs and Bierwurst Plate--definitely a must-try. Crowd can be rowdy, but that's what makes this place so awesome. Staff are laid back and friendly."}, {"review_id": "bOnPn-G1bX6XK7H94UYUSQ", "user_id": "QxM76aU2aMkH8_YXgNm7HQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "This is the best place in the state to visit for a wide variety of craft beer on draft and in bottles. They offer both draft and bottles of beers from around the world, including local options. They have a small food menu which is always tempting but I haven't eaten here yet. The inside is dimly lit and very grotto like. There is also a large outdoor patio open in the warmer months. Like most places in town, Novare has a tendency to get very busy so I try to visit during the afternoon or early evening."}, {"review_id": "SiFtglZ93ALc4MEV9NGuyQ", "user_id": "CJe8O61CM4TFMcw3lDR_pQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "The best, the best, forever the best. I've been here several times and always leave happy. Tonight my boyfriend and I came in, pleasantly surprised it wasn't overwhelmed with the same belligerent folk wandering around every other bar on this particular drinking holiday. I ordered an Oxbow saison and it was so delicious I ordered one more. Boyfriend is kinda picky about his beer but he fell in love with an Orono beer and another comparable galaxy hopped IPA. He also has an insatiable sweet tooth and started his food order with their Belgian waffle adorned with Jameson caramel sauce, baileys whipped cream and of course, a la mode. It was outrageously delicious. I ordered a Vermont salami and goat cheese plate and it was the perfect accompaniment to our drinks. Can't wait until we are back in town :)"}, {"review_id": "uHjpcQ14hMEjOEpDamc2Bw", "user_id": "4f8m2bdT2j9D1sStw2WJTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Portland prices for beer, definitely.

We wanted a place to have a beer or two before we went exploring in Downtown Portland for Halloween weekend. I truly enjoyed the service of the bartenders, as they happily gave recommendations and small samplings of different beers if you were not sure. I was a bit overwhelmed by the options, but again, it was great to speak with the staff on the different types of beers. I wish I would have thought to bring a board game or cards as I saw other groups play different games. I'm giving four stars as the seasonal donuts could have been better. It could be due to the fact that we ordered the last two cider donuts, but in any case it did not taste very fresh. Would be happy to come again."}, {"review_id": "CsEQowxnQievPZyVhzqyVg", "user_id": "ZXGA3PpzWI8bm9a_ijcpMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Great vibe and a really good beer selection that includes a ton of local choices.

They have an awesome indoor bar area and a lovely back patio with umbrellas and picnic tables and art and games (like cornhole). The local beer list is extensive and they also have wine and liquor. I had a couple of Allagash Whites as I read my book on the patio while I awaited my family's arrival into town, and then we all found ourselves back there after dinner for another drink. I had a stout the second trip and it was just as delicious as my light ale.
