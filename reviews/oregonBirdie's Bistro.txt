Upon walking in, my focus was on the register where you order. Seating is free game. The menus are not obvious and are located to the left around a corner of the register. The tables next to the front windows have barstools only. However, they informed me after my review and visit that there are tables with backs located in the back of the bistro. I didn't see them readily but trust they're there. They also have round back chairs available for getting coffee and chatting. I came for lunch. They have lots of food items despite being more coffee oriented. I ordered the West Coast burger in a bed of salad. This was executed perfectly! They don't have pickles and that was sad and their mustard is the fancy stuff not just plain yellow. Service was fast and friendly."}, {"review_id": "YrkPP44xkFhYnBLRIyBQIA", "user_id": "42gnqCPYcSiLSZIu7Es3cg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "GREAT sandwiches in downtown Salem.  Definitely exceeded expectations, will be back when we are in the area again."}, {"review_id": "hD5Ry1wsWRduDlmdd9Z3UA", "user_id": "SRJV_DzWUG_KlBoCvVN4NQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Disappointing. The hash was meh. The biscuits and gravy were yuck. The french toast sticks were a letdown. Customer service was fine but the servers didn't go out of their way to help us.

Thank You, Yelpies, another GREAT suggestion!Birdie's is in a nondescript strip shopping center (Keizer Village), and we would never known it was here without Yelp. The decor is charming and cozy, and restrooms very clean. There is a comfortable patio, but there will be street noise. Birdie's Staff were very friendly and accommodating (Thank You, Tracie!).Birdie's has a large menu, but my better half and I had two of their salads. We had the Almost Cobb Salad (everything but Black Olives) ($11.75) and the Two Hearts Salad ($10.50).Very very good salads. The greens were fresh, and all the ingredients tasty. My better half was so impressed with her salad (Salem / Keizer are NOT salad towns) that she gave it Five Stars. Wow.The only thing I would change is to ask for the salad in a bowl, rather than the platter it was served on. It would make it much easier cut up, and mix together.Five Stars."}, {"review_id": "qroHKtvibNVKbtiqh4SFFQ", "user_id": "ESCI8EsV9YGrP2RbI6Y18w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Would come again!!

I've always been curious about this place and why it's so busy. Reading 5 star reviews makes me heed with caution as I'm hesitant to trust them. Pulled up the menu, called in my order, friendly service no doubt. Dropped in and picked up my order, but the coffee smelled amazing. I had to try the Mocha. I placed my order over the phone to go, but when I got there I was consumed by the peaceful atmosphere and the feel and fragrance of the place. With able seating available, I stayed and indulged. I ordered the country chicken wrap. I'm a breakfast guy, I search for good breakfast food. My expectations weren't high due to only having good chicken fried steak at a few places. Well, I'm writing that 5 star review right now. I went back and got another coffee to go and I'll keep coming back. I'm sold. I concur. Best breakfast joint in Keizer, hands down"}, {"review_id": "PMeJhPL_IextA3FYRWUUOQ", "user_id": "FBReU_JY6Ghfs1e5_5RCFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Today was my first visit to Birdie's Bistro and I was just hoping for a decent lunch to take back to the office.

Tasty breakfast wrap & good portion, although it could use a little more texture by undercooking the onions & peppers, but that's just a personal preference thing. Birdies Breakfast was pretty small, too small to make much of a dent w/ my husband's usual appetite; might have been a fluke as this was our first visit.

I ended up eating one of the two eggs and taking the rest home in a box for someone else to eat later.  In their defense, the salt level could very well be a personal preference thing. While I use a little salt when cooking I don't add salt to anything and haven't for most of my life and I find the lightly salted chips more than an adequate salt level.  If I were in the area I might go back, but I would not drive out of my way just to eat here."}, {"review_id": "m7QRpKGaCN6kCbhEgY0VeQ", "user_id": "kQQeujG-uuMouUuPu3spaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "I love this place. I come here because it is close to my work. The servers are very sweet and you can tell they enjoy being there. They are also very helpful and are willing to let you try the different kinds of soup.I order an espresso first. It comes in a very cute french-style shot mug. The taste is hit or miss but I am super picky about coffee so I can't complain. It is still the best in the area.For food I order a soup and sandwich. The soups are homemade and creative. The last I had was a chicken orzo and it hit the spot. The sandwich is served on massive homemade bread with a great flavor combination. Alas the meat is usually not much compared to everything else, but dipped in the soup glorifies it!Overall... $15 after all 3 with tip isn't too much and it gives me a real break during the day to read etc..."}, {"review_id": "V9Mz5YNht741aJE3eIqmFQ", "user_id": "3VHGy31ShzMWmv0-ghnxzw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Bad Coffee and Bad Customer Service Experience.  Stopped in for dessert and a cup of coffee.  Dessert was fine but their regular coffee was so awful that we couldn't even drink it.  Woman there said to order an Americano next time.  Really?"}, {"review_id": "kl5ShivLsemaxSOZkzyczA", "user_id": "y3al8UZ78X13vCtGa4lMgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "Great coffee and great food and even better service.
