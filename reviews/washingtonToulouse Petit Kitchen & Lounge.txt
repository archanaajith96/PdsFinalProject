We came for restaurant week on a Thursday night. I made reservations in advance because I was very excited to have cajun food for the first time since we've lived in Seattle, but boy, were we disappointed! First of all, our server was extremely rude and acted like she gave zero f****s that we were there. She literally faced away from us when we ordered, and instead of handing us the bill at the end, she put it on the ledge behind my husband and never said anything about it...it was very awkward.In terms of the food and drinks, I really couldn't eat or drink hardly anything:1. I ordered a hurricane, which was honestly a mistake on my part because I don't like overly-sweet drinks, but I figured this was the type of place to try one. Regardless, it was NOT good.2. My salad was clearly made in a bowl or with utensils that had touched completely different food with really different flavors, so every once in a while, I would get this strong oniony or meaty flavor, even though there weren't onions or meat in the salad.3. I got the blackened whitefish on top of polenta for my main course, and it was truly inedible. First of all, the fish was rotten and undercooked; it was mushy and tasted ooooold. Then, my polenta was runny and watery and dripped all over the place...this is definitely not how polenta is supposed to be cooked. 4. For dessert, I got beignets, which were also mushy and undercooked. If this place claims to be a creole-cajun-style restaurant, its beignets should be significantly better-cooked.To top it all off, this meal was decently expensive...I do not recommend making the mistake of coming here!"}, {"review_id": "vg2nZ0zDBudjfJ_00fNRFA", "user_id": "Mc-28MJn3ZfvaX1A3NaKwA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Came here based off a friends recommendation and their menu says they have high accolades from trip advisor which I thought may be a little over done. My friends and I came by for brunch and were in after a fairly short wait. We decided to start with the beignets like many others however it seemed like ours were slightly over cooked although the coffee caramel sauce is amazing!! Gumbo was pretty solid with a strong Cajun flavor and a good amount of shrimp. I also tried the catfish poboy which was average at best. The fish was luke warm and slightly soggy as well. Definitely not something I would order again. This place is pretty average for brunch and I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend."}, {"review_id": "MgwLNZY0JWBdK7a95SfpMw", "user_id": "ccvBBQRrGd_WDtYVSVoHiA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "When my cousin found out we were in Seattle she said we needed to eat here before leaving, so we made sure to make the walk for brunch!We came right when they opened for their breakfast happy hour, and this is really the way to go if you are planning on branching. My $21 dish was reduced to $15, and mimosas were $7, which are great deals for this upscale joint!Decor was not totally my style, though I could absolutely see how it was someone else's. The menu was expansive and offered options that varied wildly, which was really exciting. I seriously wanted about six things and had a really hard time picking. I eventually chose the egg charcuterie Benedict based on our server's recommendation, while my husband got something seafood based, though of course he can't remember what. The food was amazing. I ate so quickly and couldn't get enough! That Benedict did not stand a chance. My husband's seafood dish was a fantastic spice level and had more than heaping servings of fresh seafood. The food really is next level, and that's why they've earned all of the accolades they have!Downsides for me were that the service, though good was not exceptionally friendly. When you're knocking on $80's door for a breakfast I think it should be a bit more standout. Also, the mimosas were pretty tiny and we skipped ordering another because of this. This effects the vibe because it is much more fun to go into a brunch spot where people are jovially consuming their favorite breakfast beverage. Though to be fair, we came on a Friday and I'm sure the weekend gets a bit more hopping.Honestly, the food is AMAZING and the breakfast happy hour deals allow you to enjoy that a bit more. I would never regret eating here because the food was outstanding, but I don't know if it's an absolute must for me. A nicer meal should be an entire experience, and the bare decor (though the lighting fixtures were gorgeous), underwhelming service, and lack of atmosphere prevented this from fully happening. They definitely deserve every food based accolade they've gotten, though!"}, {"review_id": "SMCa90SgKJ1oMRsEgvR6YQ", "user_id": "ja2R4PFZZDUvSHB_AJDpnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Came here for my birthday dinner.

A large group of us made early reservations on a Sunday. Ordered a ginger beer which wasn't cold (tip: put your glass bottles in the fridge or make sure to serve it with ice. I don't know anyone who enjoys their soda at room temperature). The server was efficient and got me a glass filled with ice promptly. Place was packed and I remember seeing on a yelp post they are suppose to give you some bread to start. The server clearly forgot because when she finally gave it to us, our entrees arrived 2 minutes later (tip #2-Don't bother wasting side plates which add to an already cluttered table if entrees are already up-it's called time management with the kitchen). I ordered the scallops and risotto and based on instagram photos it looked pretty good...so I was disappointed when my risotto was underdone-there were thinly sliced pieces of potato which was also raw..so clearly it had not been cooked enough. I flagged down the server hoping she would rectify the situation; however she decided to take the passive aggressive approach by  saying \"our risotto is supposed to be al dente, it's supposed to be like that\"I didn't appreciate the server trying to shift the blame on to me. I had to tell her that \"ok, well the potato in it is still raw, it's crunchy,\" and showed her that the thinly sliced potato was still hard. I said the scallops were fine. She took away my plate and asked if she could provide me with another side and suggested the grits or rice (which I didn't care for, I wanted the risotto which was what I had ordered). It was obvious the place was busy and she didn't offer another risotto to be made (which is pretty lazy/lame on her part) so I suggested having  mashed potatoes. So within a few minutes the kitchen had re-plated my remaining scallops on a bed of mashed potatoes. I'm annoyed because at this point I would expect a smart server would have checked in with the manager and would have told me something along the lines of \"...hey so sorry for what happened, we'll make sure to do X (ie, give a discount, take off your drink, free dessert, etc). But nothing. Instead she checked in and asked how my mashed potatoes were. I took a page from the server and gave her some attitude back by replying \"...it's mashed potatoes. They're fine\" (in a snarky tone). At this point the server wanted to be bitchy back and responded in her passive aggressive tone \"I was just asking\".I didn't really try any of the group's entrees (gumbo,    Fried chicken, jambalaya, rockfish bouillon...but just tasted some of the sauces and they tasted decent. Everyone noted their dishes were spicy (which is very creole...so for those of you who prefer not to have things spicy, this place probably isn't for you). For desserts: beignets were whatever and the banana foster was fine. Nothing to rave about. So my evening with the group was not as enjoyable because I had higher hopes with my dining experience. Towards the end of the evening the rest of the group realized my dislike for the server wasn't unwarranted. She had time management issues with taking our payments (some of us were paying cash and we waited at least 10 minutes for the machine when I had enough bull sh*t from this amateur server). The server didn't bother discounting my dish (paying $29 for a meal you didn't actually get is not fair-Mashed potatoes vs risotto isn't the same). So while everyone was questioning the competency of our server I asked to speak with the manager. I spoke to someone who was the acting manager of the evening and told her my story of the slow bill service and expressed my poor dining experience. I admitted that I wasn't the nicest with my tone with the server and explained why. So management made things right by taking off my risotto entree. So thank you for this. Future tip: don't deal with your server if you can see they clearly don't know how to properly serve, go straight to a manager to deal with a dining issue. Would I come back? Honestly I'm not sure if I would. Perhaps I would come back for lunch or happy hour. I wouldn't recommend this place unless a friend wanted to try it. After going to Pink door the previous night (where the service was totally notch, I felt turned off by this sh*tty server). For creole-Cajun lovers, give it a try. Poor service is a huge turn off for me so out of principle I won't be recommending/promoting this place to any of my food loving friends."}, {"review_id": "L0aRlT_5nFd7pRTUYGSKfQ", "user_id": "JpO46XPH4rYWkClJQpCYlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Customer service 3/5Quick, not super friendly.

This place definitely isn't cheap, but so far, I feel like nothing in Seattle is.We went with the pork cheek hash, chicken fried chicken, and the dungeness crab benedict. The pork cheek hash was actually refreshing and the combo of green apples, arugula, and jalapeno paired perfectly together. The chicken fried chicken was delicious and that creole gravy sauce was to die for. Also their potatoes were well seasoned and simply the best I've had.

I'm serious- as soon as I walk in the door- just bring me a plate of those luscious powdered sugar sprinkled freshly cooked pillows from heaven! Otherwise known as Toulouse's beignets, these delectable little desserts are what keep me coming back! The restaurant in and of itself is lovely too. Beautiful decor throughout and so many thoughtful design touches from the cast iron lamps to the hand tiled floors- this place truly is a feast for the senses! Even on weekdays there is usually a bit of a wait. This place seems most popular for weekend brunch and late night (hello beignets!) The wait is worth it though and you'll not find beignets as good as these anywhere else in Seattle. Foodwise: if you've never actually been to Cajun Country- you'll love the menu at Toulouse! But if you have experienced the marvelous deliciousness of the cuisine of Southern Louisiana first hand - know that Toulouse doesn't quite meet the mark. Sigh. But considering we're a thousand plus miles from the foodie delights of New Orleans, Lafayette, Baton Rouge, etc. this place comes close-ish. So suck it up buttercup! Take a deep breath and keep an open mind before you step in the door. Come for the food and enjoy the restaurant in its own right - its a beautiful place and the food is great!Foodie fav here for sure are the beignets. Have I recommended the beignets yet? Order a plate for yourself and tell me they don't taste so close to the ones at Cafe du Monde?! Delicious, comforting, luscious and classic. The eggs benedicts and scrambles are wonderful too - there are several to choose from. I have yet to taste one that I didn't like. Try them all! Once in a great while they serve a chef's special of fried green tomatoes with creamy shrimp sauce. Get it. It's amazing! At night this place has a different vibe for sure. They turn down the lights, crank up the music and it's party time! Nice big bar in the back with well made drinks: generous with the alcohol and not overpriced. Perfect.All and all- Toulouse is a great place and I recommend it to visitors of the city often. It's just a few blocks from The Seattle Center with The Space Needle, MoPop, The Chihuly Glass Museum, etc. so it's a great place to start a day of touring!"}, {"review_id": "hk2I-UuEdq_RZgTi1XpsIA", "user_id": "CYcdDqwMs4sVHfSCPB4VBw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Yelp's Elites definitely tell the truth. I wish i slow down and read my peers reviews before I came back. In my personal opinion, not yours: A culinary disaster, an insult to all the dead marines that ended up in compose because I couldn't enjoy any of my Shrimp & Crawfish & Sausage, and Grits. Sadly, there aren't that many creole restaurant in Seattle. I traveled through out the US to try people shrimp and grits, the best I've found near Seattle is at #1 Tapalaya, Portland, OR, shrimp and grits with blue crab, ask my friend Anh Lou to serve it up, it's a secret menu. Celebrity Chef/owner is a Louisiana's native.#2 Hudson, Seattle, WA, cheesy and to the point.#3 Comfort Zone, Columbia City-Seattle WA, Cheesy Grits#4 Simply Soulful, Seatrle, WAHonorable mentioning: Island Soul.Here at this restaurant, the presentation/plating art taken 2nd place behind Tapalaya and exceeding all of Seattle, but failed miserably in taste.Time out! It was an insult when the grits was not fully cooked down, there were clumps of uncooked grits.Then I really had to send it back when the citrus went beyond tolerable. They used a lot of tomato/added vinegar, my god, one bite of it, and it made so depressed, that once again, many years later after my first visit, this restaurant still have the same problem-- Their grits are horrible. Gladly my server was kind enough to accept the feedback and shared she never had it, and she will swap out with fried chicken steak-- some how, i remembered the Pesos's chicken steak with cheddar cheese more. I like the interior ambience of this restaurant, and it's staffs, but the food, is just too offensive. I'm not body important, but just a guy who was really hungry and have been waiting for a whole week to find time to come and eat some amazing grits, so he thought, after being teased by yelp's photos.
