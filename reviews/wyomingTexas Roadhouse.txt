I came with a bunch of friends and had a great time. Our server was great and we all had a fun time. The food is great, I got the 8 ounce salmon and it was great.my brother had the wings and he gave it 5 stars, and the reat of my family had steaks. It was delicious, and a fun experience. Everyone thought it was a great place to hang out and had reasonable prices. Very delicious, and a fun experience. 2nd time: I came back and this time was much better. We had mostly the same stuff, and we thought it was great. Bree was our server, and she was super friendly, and kept on top of getting our drinks and food. She was the reason I changed my review from 4 stars to 5 stars. Thanks Bree, and the entire Texas roadhouse staff 5 starsP.S. Bree deserves a raise or a bonus."}, {"review_id": "5dr5Yca4D2a_AEH7XARAhQ", "user_id": "lf8XvbKCEKrb0zumJv16yw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Never disappoints, plenty of great food and awesome staff.

My boyfriend ordered his  steak well done and it came out medium.  The manager lady didn't want to make a new one after we repeatedly asked.. She oviously hasnt eatin a steak the was\"put back on the grill\" before . You just dont do that! If she wasn't so rude it wouldnt be such a problem. Maybe some training on how to handle situations like this would help keep returning guest coming back.."}, {"review_id": "6oVQLzDq3iLgbfyM4BvShA", "user_id": "xPoTxf6Wa2FM3FjBP2P0Eg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2017", "text": "This place is great. I come to Cheyenne often from out of town. Most of the time we eat when visiting it's here. Food is great, pricing is more than reasonable. I think they have some of the best ribs and sides you can order anywhere. Oh and let's not forget the addicting rolls with cinnamon butter. Wait staff is always pleasant and pretty attentive. Environment is great with fun decor and tunes that aren't super loud. Dim lighting also gives off an intimate vibe.

The roadkill is a 10 oz. chop steak smothered with sautéed onions,sautéed mushrooms and jack cheese. despite the unappealing name, my lunch was fresh, hot and tasty.  It also came with 2 sides, I chose the side salad, which was big enough to be an entree itself, and a baked sweet potato. The table service also came with a basket of fresh, soft, and hot dinner rolls that were served with cinnamon butter which was really addicting. The price was really good also at only $9.99. The waitress was on top of her game also filling my water glass and getting me several  to go boxes, since my lunch was so big I couldnt finish it."}, {"review_id": "a3n0EvpJHq3IBhMLwF_XAA", "user_id": "pNMogtF3OTR4vJ79eTz9EQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "We love Texas Roadhouse but unfortunately last time we ate there we had an unexpected guest by our table... and it was really gross!

Got sat down and it took about 5 minutes for someone to come and bring drinks. The waiter was very nice and very thorough with everything. He made sure we had what we needed every few minutes. He apologized when we were getting ready to leave cause he hadn't checked on us for like 5 minutes. We had both ordered steaks and they were cooked perfect. We both had salads and I had some rotten lettuce in mine and that was gross. I had mashed potatoes and there was a huge chuck of black, rotten potatoes in mine. Even though I had a couple rotten pieces of food I was able to enjoy it and the waiter made it worth while."}, {"review_id": "fRa4V5FVqZ5V_1p7d5AdSQ", "user_id": "iqVTvhV5lhB59PfaxtXC9g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/22/2016", "text": "Birthdays are special in our house and the birthday person gets the privilege of selecting where they want to go eat. For the younger ones, there is still a limit as to what choices they may have. For example, most fast food restaurants are NOT going to be an option. So, when our youngest opted for Texas Roadhouse, I figured that we were raising her right. Having additional family along, we were a party of seven and arrived exactly at 4pm when they opened. The country music was at the right sound level and the greeters did their best to make us feel welcome immediately. We had chosen not to do the call ahead seating, but we were still seated within 3 or 4 minutes of arrival. Our waitress was new and it was obvious that she was more than a little nervous. However, we decided to try and break the ice with a little humor. Each of our party had ordered and she dutifully wrote down each thing so she would not forget. I told her that I would like water on the rocks - shaken, not stirred. She proceeded to put pen to paper when she realized what I had asked and she started laughing. The drinks were brought promptly and the peanuts and bread rolls were available just for the asking. We each placed our order and it arrived quickly and was hot. I tried something different by ordering a baked potato without any salt crusted on the outside. It was PERFECT. I was even able to eat every bit of the skin.If you like steak, I would recommend spending a little bit more and getting the ribeye. It is well marbled and the outside edge of the steak had just a bit of a crusty edge along the fatty sides. The flavor was incredible and medium well had just the right amount of pink. You could cut the steak with a fork.Throughout our meal, our new waitress was a great sport putting up with the strange requests from our table. After expressing \"disappointment\" that the baked potatoes did not come with whipped cream on the top, she insisted that she would inform the management of this deficiency and she was \"certain\" it would be corrected on our next visit.Overall, the service was great, the food was incredible, and we walked away quite content. In addition, for the birthday girl, they brought the saddle for her to sit on and made a big deal about it by giving her a great big Texas Roadhouse \"yee-haw!\" Although she wanted that, she was also very embarrassed. A great trip and great customer service. A return visit will be forthcoming soon.*cross-posted to my TripAdvisor account*"}, {"review_id": "F5ohqCZcT5l4mXt_R9xcDg", "user_id": "hebNAr83JMzUs2UKMmHm3Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/22/2017", "text": "This one of my favorite places to go for an off-busy hour meal.
