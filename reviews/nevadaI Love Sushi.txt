The servers and managers learn who you are when you come often so you truly do feel at home. It's casual in decor and comfort.Food: sometimes we ravage our food so quickly that we don't remember the names of what we ordered! We do remember enjoying a 80% something and a sex on the beach and a mistake something lol. There's raw and baked and cooked rolls for everyone to try! We love getting \"easy rice\" so there's not as much rice cramping our style tasting the fishy deliciousness! There's also great calamari! The drinks selection includes just enough house wine and beer and sake selection to get you through your meal. I love Sushi makes Sushi to order that's quick and amazing and perfect to get your fix!"}, {"review_id": "kWIiPoB1OI4uYNGlVn-zKg", "user_id": "LNA1ceWE61qxXQP4HSJQBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "I love sushi because this place is good,  name says it all! Every Roll has a unique explosion of flavors that complement the fish each roll showcases.  Presentation is appetizing and the size is generous. The fish is fresh and rice is flavorful!  One of my favorite features in their rolls is the little crunchiness from the soft shell crab and/or shrimp tempura inside the roll. Lately I've been enjoying the Nabeyaki Udon soup served in a cast iron pot which is so nice during the cold days! Been a regular customer for almost a decade!"}, {"review_id": "Go3RZYueJvBu4mVrUnF5jw", "user_id": "IiVxPc2QRs2yttA_qW3A8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Family favorite, even though we are mostly eating vegan now.

I spent the first 34 years of my life avoiding it at all costs...and then...The soy wrapper.Game changer.Wow.So, once I found out about the amazing soy wrapper it changed everything for me. The seaweed wrapper is fishy to me, I didn't enjoy that. The soy wrapper is nothing, no taste, just keeps the rolls together. So now I'm able to try almost anything. My favorite thing at I Love Sushi is the Tempura Roll. It comes with rice, avocado, cream cheese and then I substituted the eel for cooked shrimp. It's lightly battered with panko and flash fried then topped with eel sauce. It's so good. We usually get two of these because everyone always picks off my plate. My wife loves the Pho.We always call and make a reservation. They host/hostesses always make me laugh because they make sure to remind me to be on time at least twice during the call. Reservations are key on the weekends because the waits can be relatively long.Also, the service is always spot-on. Super friendly servers, very attentive, glass always full. They also check on you multiple times throughout the meal. Outstanding!"}, {"review_id": "FC6bNNWEXoosuoQrmffNYw", "user_id": "uFEMHfCR64FpMUJY0Oo02w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Definitely one of my favorite sushi spots in Las Vegas...the only downside (which really isn't, is the menu is HUGE, which makes it impossible to try everything even after 20 visits). Sitting at the sushi bar you truly feel as if you could be somewhere in Japan, and the waitresses in kimonos lends to the feel. We had the Dynamite, the seared peppered ahi with avocado and Double Ds, all of which were delicious.

Five stars is what I have to give this place because well, it was friggin' tasty and the service was LEGIT as well!We were seated at a table within 10 minutes of arriving without a reservation... And then we dove into the VERY CONFUSING MENU... While I totally would have taken a star off for the menu basically resembling hieroglyphics, the rolls we finally decided on were so good, I couldn't! What I would recommend is taking photos of ALL THE ROLLS so people can get a visual of what they're about to order- HIRE ME, and I'll do it! Ha!Any who... Here's what I ordered (there was more ordered but I was so into making out with my own order, I didn't really pay attention!)- Salmon Skin Handrolls (no rice, no sauce, no vegetables): This is a staple order for me, everywhere I go... If a sushi restaurant doesn't have Salmon skin, I don't go! I was VERY IMPRESSED with the portion they gave me-- typically restaurants aren't used to my type of order thus they're stingy with their salmon skin, but not this place! Oh and the skin was crunchy and pretty perfect!- Hamachi Kama: this was a last minute decision and I'm really glad I did it because it was MOIST AND BOMB! I love the cabbage accompaniment (that doesn't have dressing) because I took bites of the meat and the cabbage together and YUM!!! - Rock N Roll, Roll (no rice, no crab- wrapped in cucumber): this is legit what I wanted but I had to create the menu item-- as this one comes with sauce on top, rice, crab and it's wrapped in nori... But without blinking an eye, they made this roll possible and IM THRILLED cause yes please! The fish to cucumber ratio was PERFECT! And the fish was FRESH AS F!- Seared Pepper Tuna with Avocado: I didn't order this but three plates were ordered for the table... And I'm glad I got to snag a piece, because it was SUPER TASTY! It would definitely be something I share with others though because I love Salmon 20x more than tuna!Next time I come to Vegas, YEP- coming back here! It's not close to the strip and I'm 100% a-ok with that! When good food is on my radar, I don't care how far away it is from me!"}, {"review_id": "DY0QrXOPwdgJ9spDHkTX4w", "user_id": "ORenf7fwHoZtkDYRV05PUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "My favorite sushi restaurant I have ever been too.

The Mochi ice cream dessert is a must! They offer you 4 different options of flavors. I selected Mango, Chocolate, Green tea and Red bean. I wasn't too impressed with the Green tea one so maybe get extra Chocolate or Mango, the Mango was awesome!!I love the vibe here and the customer service is great!!!

Service was extremely slow. Everything from getting our order in, getting our food, and getting the bill took way too long. The server checked on our table only once.They don't have AYCE as an option. The rolls were priced higher than most places, but the rolls were a little bigger. I ordered the D.C. roll and the Happy Ending roll. They were ok, nothing that made me say \"omg this is so good\" more like \"eh, I've had better\" haha. The D.C. roll had soft shell crab in it, which is my favorite thing, but I did not like it in this roll. It left a burnt flavor in the roll like it was fried for too long. If you order this roll I also do not recommend pouring all of the special sauce on it at one time. I made that mistake and it was just too much for the roll. The Happy Ending also had a lot going on, they burnt the soft shell crab in this roll too. It was good, but I think next time I would stick to a regular Japanese lasagna roll.I was in the area and wanted to give it a try because of the reviews... but im very picky about my sushi places so I don't see myself coming back here."}, {"review_id": "mgs2tbkhHVHKyzIleESLuw", "user_id": "9RNlHCvmf_244DbBasFISQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Our favorite sushi place!!!

I have been here several times. We were a group of 5 and we ordered it up! We had Burning My Stomach, Boom Boom Nipple Special, Kitchen Sink, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Deep Fried Cheesecake.  I'm know I'm missing some things. We shared everything.   That Deep Fried Cheesecake is everything! It tasted like a delicious funnel cake, lol.  And there's something to eat for everyone. Even if you are not a \"sushi\" person. By the way, you can tell they get creative with naming their meals, lol. The names will make you laugh and think \"I can't believe they named it that!\"Service is fantastic! The staff is so active, quick, and friendly. This is a great place for family and/or friends to have a great time. Prices: I would say it's moderate ($$).  They make everything at time of order. Groups are always coming through here because they can easily share the food and share the bill. ;-)  If it was too expensive, I would think most locals wouldn't be coming  on a nightly busy.
