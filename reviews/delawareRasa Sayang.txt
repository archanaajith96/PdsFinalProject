I must have been here at  least 10 times so I suppose the review is long overdue.They have a variety of vegetarian options and dishes customizable to make them vegetarian, which should help the non meat eaters. I on the other hand love the following dishes:Roti Canai (chicken - however veg option is available)Roti TelurPineapple Fried RiceWhile I have tried several other dishes and they didn't disappoint."}, {"review_id": "fuY-YrL7TU1J1ecQq7lflQ", "user_id": "dqucQwA-CHWhUczwqIxKKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "My friend is part of a lunchtime dining rotation with his coworkers and he came to Rasa, loved it and decided to take me for dinner on a busy Friday night.  I am hooked!As you enter there is a tiny bar on the left that seats perhaps five or six and there were some leftovers finishing up their happy hour. So I took a glance at the happy hour menu and prices and it seemed well worth it to try it again sometime for happy hour. Once seated it only took me a couple minutes to realize I was thrilled to be here for dinner. We came without reservations but were seated promptly and were amazed that two servers could handle the entire place incredibly well. Our female server, apologies for forgetting her name,  took care of us extremely well throughout the meal. Menu: -Thai Pineapple Fried Rice-I chose mine With shrimp and it is served beautifully in a halved pineapple. -Mango Delight with Beef. Wonderfully cooked beef inside scooped out mangos with the insides sliced and incorporated into the dish. I stole a few bites. Delight is an understatement! We look forward to many more Friday's here."}, {"review_id": "MrJ2NXpM24CR-_SMx2AkPg", "user_id": "jpIeyBZYl7cnfrLVp_bH8A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This place is one of our all time favorites.

Do I know what this dish is exactly? Maybe not, but it's probably served at Disney World. It's kinda like a very thin flatbread. It's a little crunchy, yet soft and warm.  It's probably best if you just drink the sauce. Seriously though, this dish is absolutely delicious. I know I'm not exaggerating because every time I've dined in, Ive seen this app on every table. Every table.Oh yes, there's other food here too! I've had a few dishes, all were delicious. The portion size is very generous and everything I've ever had is incredibly fresh and beautiful.  My favorites so far have been the pepper chicken or tofu and for noodles the mee siam.  I love the energy in this place too. The lunch crowd is huge which is great to see and the dinner crowd is steady. Our waitresses are helpful, pleasant and run that restaurant seamlessly.I'll conclude with....roti canai, for breakfast lunch dinner and dessert. Do it."}, {"review_id": "cITSmOuKciaeyIjWEsQKDg", "user_id": "th_t7aq87x6UxjEQLbXeOQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Have enjoyed the food here for many years both dine in and take out, usually get the pineapple fried rice and chicken curry.

Service was friendly and helpful.This is a tentative review, b/c we asked for a couple of main dishes to have the spice toned down to accommodate our heat-adverse friend Dena. I believe that robbed us of much of their flavor. The Rasa Curry was more like an Indonesian peanut satay, and the Chay Koay Teow and String Bean Shrinp were both relatively flavorless. All three clearly had been de-spiced for Dena, but nothing was added to offset the flavor loss. The Chef's Sea Bass in a soy sauce was also flavorless, but it was not supposed to be spicy in the 1st place.The Leo beer (Thai) was nothing special, and would have better suited the meal if I'd had spicy food to put out with it. The jelly soy bean drink was like a funky cross of a Thai iced tea and a bubble tea.I'm interested in visiting Rasa Sayabg again to try it with the full spice experience."}, {"review_id": "15pvlkc8PsFSJ7zlfmms-A", "user_id": "M1ggQQMtIif0iae0xnA1Cw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "The food was good. If it was about the food, I  would definitely eat there again. The problem was the poor service. Waitress delivered our food and never came back to the table until we stood up to leave. We sat for nearly 15 minutes after we were clearly finished eating waiting for take out containers and the check. It was only after I got up and approached the hostess that we got any attention. We paid, and as we were leaving, the hostess said, in a foreign language that we didn't leave a tip. She didn't realize my co-worker understood what she said.

The staff is always kind and welcoming and the food is really delicious. I'm a simple person, I don't branch out too often, so here my entree of choice is the chicken fried rice. It always comes out piping hot and they give you a very large portion for the price, I always end up taking a ton home. Also, the Rasa Sayang iced tea is absolutely amazing. I don't know how they make it, but it's sweet and has added fruit flavors. Also, you can't leave without trying their fried ice cream!

I sat at a booth in the window right at the door and the sever was prompt and very nice. After sipping and munching on my two starter items I was super excited to get to the next course which I was torn between the Red Snapper with Thai sauce, Sea Bass or the pineapple fried rice however my server tried to help but made it more complex by explained what was amazing about each item LOL...I ended up with the Snapper which was AMAZING.

We chose a window seat and later on shifted to another table which could accommodate all five of us, thats where the server was visibly displeased in-spite of having not much of a crowd then. We were asked to order quickly as the kitchen was to close - down. But as we ordered on the higher side, the waitress was even more displeased. Possibly due to working late on a Sunday afternoon.

Rasa Sayang is a very conveniently located restaurant in Wilmington, and offers a fun and lively atmosphere to dine in. There is a happy hour offering discounts on select drinks at their in-house bar, as well as on some appetizer items. Speaking of appetizers, I highly recommend the roti canai, which is a warm and fluffy pancake-like appetizer served with a side of delicious chicken curry. After trying roti canai at other places and a failed attempt of making it at home, I have grown to really appreciate the skill required to make Rasa Sayang's amazing roti canai. It was so delicious that we promptly returned the following day to dine at this restaurant again! We also tried the roti telur, which was a bit more filling than the roti canai, however not as satisfying. Apart from the appetizers, they also had some notable main course dishes. We tried the noodle dishes (chay koay teow and mee goreng), which were very flavorful and came in extremely generous portions! This restaurant is a rare gem for asian food lovers, in a location that offers extremely limited selection of asian eats."}, {"review_id": "DYtevieW67OngBQGLQkykw", "user_id": "NEOrTkHJq4imAs-6YqmPeg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/21/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Updated 8-21-173 StarsCame back here after a month or two with my family. Again, the roti canai was hot, crispy, chewy and delicious - the best part of the meal. Everything else was blah. I asked two or three times for my Mee Goreng to be extra, extra spicy but it came to the table almost tasting sweet. Had to ask the server for something to make it spicy and they gave me a bottle of Sriracha sauce and a small bowl of chopped chilis. I refused to dump the Sriracha sauce on my food but tried the chilis, which helped a little.  Still not sure why they can't make it a 8 or 9 on the \"heat\" scale. My wife had the same issue with her noodle dish; it was just not spicy enough. First visit results: Overall 3.5 to 4 starsThe roti canai was wonderful and delicious. Tried to order Kang Kung (green vegetable like broccoli) but they did not have it available that day. Wife got green chicken curry, I had pad Thai and my daughter had a shrimp with broccoli dish. We asked for everything to be made spicy, and instead everything turned out sweet. No spiciness of any kind in the food. It was tasty just not spicy. Would come back again but only to get more roti canai."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/rasa-sayang-wilmington?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
