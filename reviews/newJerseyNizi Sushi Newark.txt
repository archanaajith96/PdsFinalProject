It has become our kind of tradition the night before the 5 borough ride. It's off on a side street and a lot of the area has shut down or is undergoing refurbishment. The staff is generally friendly, they have always been quick and attentive. The food quality has always been good when we've been here. I'd personally like a couple more options for sashimi platters, but I'm used to this back home.  Only other thing is they have a weird odor when you first walk in. This could be something that is just in the area since other places have shut down... all in all though the food is solid the staff is accommodating and ill be back."}, {"review_id": "j_C2ijg18S5_bgrl8nMiQg", "user_id": "43_TpE-umAuXoIMwXZg50g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "The store looks small from outside, but it has many tables and bar seats available.

Very disappointed. There is ALWAYS something missing from the order and they won't deliver what is missing. I have ordered and the rolls came destroyed toppled on on another, out inferno roll came mixed with a avocado and tuna roll which were for two separate people and the roll was ruined. If you're gonna get anything the spicy combo is great but don't expect them to bring the spicy mayo you pay for it is always forgotten and they always refuse to bring it to me even though I'm 3 blocks away."}, {"review_id": "cbUuXStQJvc26JZYzT9flw", "user_id": "V0c-AS2FFCeSaV-3JfG5vA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2017", "text": "My husband and I have been on a Nizi Sushi kick recently, so I figured it's about time that I write a review. First off, here's a list of my menu recommendations: - Tofu Teriyaki App- Spring Roll (veggie-friendly!)- Sweet Potato Tempura App- Miso Soup- Green Salad with ginger dressing- Volcano Roll- Banzai Roll- Johns Roll- Any of the Special Combo Rolls (there's tuna, salmon, spicy, maki, and  veggie)- Shrimp Kop DolNow, onto the proper review. I'd say that Nizi is the best place to get sushi in Newark. It's a perfect spot for people who work in the area during the work week, students in University Heights looking to go out over the weekend or late night, and locals in the area in search of some good sushi, Japanese, and Korean dishes. For me, I think it's better to dine-in than to order take-out/delivery. Aside from the sleek decor with the long bar, exposed brick, and artwork on the walls, the food is just better when it comes straight from the kitchen and/or sushi bar. Take-out is fine for sushi, but I don't think that the hot food travels as well if you are picking up and bringing home. Also, if you want delivery, know that delivery is limited to a 1 mile radius and not into Harrison (over the bridge). Also, dining in, you can order drinks. Everyone working at Nizi has been super friendly. I haven't met one person with stank face. I know, it may seem a little silly to have to state that, but I've encountered people in other businesses with an attitude, so you know, give praise where praise is due, right? What's nice here is that they are welcoming, and that enhances the whole experience. Lastly, I like going here because it offers many options for my vegetarian husband. He likes to order the Veggie Combo, which comes with AAC Roll (avocado, asparagus, cucumber), Asparagus Tempura Roll, and Sweet Potato Roll. He'll also order a Green Salad and the Tofu Teriyaki App to start. But the menu has other vegetarian options like Vegetable Udon, Vegetable Kop Dol, Tofu Teriyaki Dinner Set, and a whole vegetable roll section on the menu.Highly recommended! Go check out Nizi Sushi Newark!"}, {"review_id": "0D3l2J3gz_7mLM9H3V6C4Q", "user_id": "rWx9XsXQB4NcA_ExkgLIMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "Love this restaurant!

Best sushi around and even has a few Korean dishes as well.Just came after work and sat at the bar to get some sushi to go.  Waited for about ten minutes and left.  Three people were at the bar previously who were already served.  Two people came in after me and sat next to me and got taken care of. Still I sat.  Shook my head and walked out, not worth the effort.Came back and all is good again.  Seems like they get busy and may not have the staff to support extra busy times.

Me and an old friend of mine used to come here almost every week if not every week and sit at the bar talking to Pete and Corey.

I've had sushi from other spots but they never had that good quality that I believe Nizi's has. This is my go to spot for sushi and I even got my parents hooked on it as well.

My handy dandy Yelp app told me that Nizi Sushi is less than 10 minutes walking from where I was AND they take mobile orders so that was a no-brainer. I was a little bit wary of ordering from here when I saw that the lunch specials are over $13 because that seems a little high, but I didn't really have the time to research what comes with the lunch special and ordered the \"Spicy Roll Lunch Box\".Turns out it was a lot of food! It came with three rolls: spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and California roll as well as edamame, miso soup, and a salad. I would have liked the option to chose two rolls instead of three but either way I now see that it's a great deal.The spicy rolls were great and didn't use that shredded up fish/tempura crunch combo that a lot of the other places use these days. My order was ready for me even earlier than the estimated time that Yelp showed so that's always a plus. The location itself is pretty small and mostly consists of a long bar and a few tables for seating. Nice ambiance though, I would imagine it's a good place for happy hour!"}, {"review_id": "QMad2KV4LNleJ6u1uKBo4A", "user_id": "ecHVLvRns0gRNRsnG2c8ow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Actually pretty good sushi for Newark.

One drawback is the service: My friend wanted water but wasn't able to get it until after the miso soup.

When I called the restaurant Bella told me too bad there's nothing I can do. So now I'm out over $20 bucks for food I put in the trash.

The first time, we were very hungry and craving sushi, so we looked for a place nearby (we like around Rutgers). On our first visit, my girlfriend ordered tempura Udon, which she absolutely loves, and I ordered a Korean dish called Hwee Dup Bap, which is essentially rice and sushi. The rice was not sushi rice, and the spicy sauce was a supermarket brand. I was pretty disappointed. But since they had a bar, we decided to come in again.On our second visit, we ordered a lemon drop martini and a Guinness beer. The beer was fine and so was the lemon drop martini, although they were confused as to how to make it at first; the bartender asked if it was a martini or a margarita. FYI, they don't have vodka, only sake.We ordered our drinks at the same time as we ordered our food. They served us our drinks and we sat there for about 25 minutes, until our server came to inform us that the kitchen was closing so they wouldn't be able to serve our food. We came in at 8:30PM, and they close at 10PM, so ponder over that. It didn't make sense. Anyway, if you want to eat from this place, take out might be best. The bartender was friendly and offered us shots for this horrible experience.
