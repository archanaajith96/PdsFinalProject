We stopped in fully expecting an old school diner with a long wait, so we were pleasantly surprised when the wait was half of what we were told. If you're expecting fast food and brand surroundings, you're going to be disappointed. The waitress was very apologetic about the wait, but we didn't think it was bad at all! The service was fantastic.  The food was well worth the wait. The Veg BELT was delicious, the hash browns were great, and my husband loved the Mexican Hash. We will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "kLYIq9oolsNF_M6FE2CREg", "user_id": "bpzl4tBtI5wtIH9nGWjmKQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "The food was interesting to say the least. It wasn't bad but wasn't great either. The portions are small and the drinks weren't being refilled. The wait time was short and food preparation time was quick but overall it was just alright.

Based on other reviews, we were prepared for the limited parking, and expected a lengthy wait to be seated as a party of four, but we found decent parking across the street and actually had a table ready within 10 minutes. The self-serve coffee station was also a nice touch. Things went downhill from there.The raised table we were given was uncomfortable and inconvenient. We were frequently bumped or brushed against as servers and customers walked by, and there was no crossbar on my stool so my feet dangled the whole time.Once ordering, we had to wait an hour for our food, with little attention from our server in the meantime, and nothing was offered to help tide us over. When the food finally arrived, we were given a lame excuse about the church crowd. For a place that's been open more than a couple months that seems like poor management, not something that caught the kitchen by surprise.The food, itself, was the biggest disappointment. To be clear, nothing was bad but, after reading all the 4- and 5-star reviews, I expected something to at least stand out. The huevos rancheros and chicken & waffles were simply okay; nothing special. Tomato pie was bland; with not nearly enough of the namesake tomato. On the other hand, the veggie wrap was mostly lettuce.Perhaps we'll try again some day."}, {"review_id": "N2gG6rHufEkAa3WzASakkQ", "user_id": "WCZFsrIfQaN8Fg2S1ersWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "This was my first time at Junction Kitchen. It was smaller than I expected and had a simple quaint feel to it. It does not appear fancy or upscale outside or inside, but the food was good and the prices were pretty good as well.Service-I was greeted immediately upon entering and told there would be a 15 min wait. My table ended up being ready in 5 minutes. My server disappeared a lot. It was crowded and I had to keep asking the hostess who was standing near my table for things like napkins, a to-go box and eventually the check. She was friendly but she could have used some help.Overall good food affordable prices.Note- Ask about the daily chicken and waffle special!* Maple Glazed donut was delicious."}, {"review_id": "JhSz5Pu9rSqkCbdnB79USg", "user_id": "Hkf1Louo_WA_oNghgut4gw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Ready for a great brunch? Because this place will not disappoint. The restaurant is lively and eclectic with an old diner feel. There's a bar to sit, coffee bar to serve yourself coffee and a small market in the back to pick up some last minute local goods. The food was great. At our table we had the breakfast burrito, the omelette and their old fashioned glazed donut (you can't pass on it!) So much food so be ready to leave full. Everything was seasoned and cooked well and completely satisfied our brunch cravings. The place seemed to be used to the brunch rush because although it was ridiculously busy, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Our server was very polite and attentive as well. We cannot wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "S1QmxUX_97ggy9y9RtnNzw", "user_id": "vdDJoD8ifRu-No8QqeUoLA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So we were very pleased with this place the first time. We were so pleased that when friends came into town, we told them that we HAVE to eat brunch here. We raved over the chicken and waffles which were on point the first time around. We come here the second time, and my friends and husband order the chicken and waffles. Now I acknowledge that they don't serve the \"same\" chicken and waffles each time you come here (different accoutrements, etc.). They bring theirs out, and IT IS A FROZEN EGGO WAFFLE. I'm sorry but if you are known as a breakfast/brunch/lunch dive, make your own waffles. It's honestly not that hard to do and a hell of a lot better and more impressive than Eggos. The worst part about it all is how much my husband and I had talked this place up only to have frozen waffles brought our"}, {"review_id": "1h33pSaPsXG-DfY1VeLiQg", "user_id": "wwEV66BaaGIiXerjrPMziQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Was heading to the airport and in the mood for something tasty before I got on the plane, so we ended up at The Junction for lunch. I've heard great things about it before we went, so I was worried it wouldn't live up to my expectations, but boy did they ever! I recommend coming with a group of people who are willing to share, because I had the worst case of menu indecision that I've had in a long time because everything looked so good! We ended up splitting pimento cheese grits and an order of the fried limas as an appetizer (they don't really have an appetizer menu, but I do what I want). The pimento grits were delightfully creamy and cheesy, and you should definitely get them. The fried limas were surprisingly delicious. Like fried chickpeas but much bigger and whatever spice they use on them should be bottled and sold by the pound. Fo an actual entree, I ordered the mexican hash with cactus pork, black beans, cheesy hashbrowns, jalapeno honey chutney, and an over-easy egg. It was a little spicy, but so delicious I couldn't stop eating. I absolutely can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!"}, {"review_id": "3hWhiphTqIf_f84VHZKMsw", "user_id": "inutksWMODqx0BuNFYYObg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Very disappointed!! We sat down right away.The service was terrible! It took at least 8 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge we were waiting. We ordered our drinks and food immediately but never got our drinks. We eventually had to remind our waitress that we had ordered mimosas. My kids never got their juice. Our food came but it wasn't anything special. Then when our bill came, the juices were on the bill, we had to tell our waitress that the juices didn't arrive. She just said, \"sorry, I'll take it off\" no apology for bad service!

This place is quite popular in the yelp community and I know why! This spot is modern American with a southern twang. The decor is very divey and hipster - quite nice! Service was impeccable and this place does fill up quick like others have mentioned! I ordered a portobello and pork taco (special request) and a \"busket\" with jam. They use the term busket for a biscuit!

Its especially popular for brunch - my favorite meal to visit.  There is usually a wait but the low prices, and delicious meals more than make up for it.  The atmosphere and staff are super laid back. This is a \"dive-bar\" brunch spot. I'm a big fan of their Pigs In a Blanket with rosemary maple syrup dip, the Brownie Pancakes and their eggs - always done perfectly. The mimosas aren't bad either :)Overall, the Junction is one of my favorite Charleston go-to spots.
