Glad we did!  We were tired after a long day of driving.  We were hungry so ordered an appetizer in addition to our entrees.  Delicious, for sure (EVERY last bite we ate was melt in your mouth wonderful), but we could have just ordered one entree (no appetizer) and split it and it still would have filled our bellies.  You definitely won't leave hungry!  The restaurant looked as if there had just been a large party, chairs and tables were kind of everywhere and the floor was in desperate need of a vacuum to be run.  But our server was a very sweet young lady and did a great job.  She was friendly and quick with refills of tea and water.  It was a great experience and if we're back in town, we will stop in!"}, {"review_id": "xMJGhHb9qkY6yIZdmp2BVA", "user_id": "_LNw2gyAFQGe7GUlSAj_0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "It's taken me a few years to return back to Mediterranean Grill since I often crave other restaurants with similar cuisine. But I'm happy I finally took the time to dine here this last Friday. The fattoush salad was delicious. The tangy dressing is the best I've had in Wichita. The ingredients were crisp and fresh. The chicken Kababs have a great marinade and when grilled has that charred taste that I absolutely love. The chicken was perfectly cook which kept the meat tender. Gyro was hot and tasty with freshly cooked tomatoes mixed with tahini sauce. They definitely love using tomatoes as you can see in several of the photos. The hummus wasn't my favorite. I felt it was too creamy and lacked flavor. I added a bit of lemon juice which seemed to help.I dined with my family and they all enjoyed their meal. Portion sizes and price range were fair.Service was great. Looking around it only seemed like there were three individuals busing, running food, filling water, and bring checks. I commend the staff, because they were successful in meeting their consumers needs without being continually reminded all while they had a smile on their face."}, {"review_id": "1Thnkc8vZRltXDYH3wtkIA", "user_id": "lsaAR6Vy6RAHuTLZaLNpow", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2017", "text": "Went here for lunch with a couple of my friends. We love Mediterranean food so we thought we'd give this place a try since I had a cool deal from Groupon. I had also looked at their menu prior to visiting and it made me even more hungry.Our waitress was super nice... in a way, she was very motherly...? I would have to say she's probably one of the most outgoing waitresses I've ever encountered. However, service was still pretty slow for a restaurant that wasn't busy (that day, at that time). Not only that, she had forgotten our request for more pita bread despite having reassured us that she was going to go get us more. Our food was not so bad. I got some lamb kababs with rice. I'm not a picky eater, but I don't really enjoy eating raw tomatoes. My dish was covered with diced tomatoes which at first made the plate look colorful but slowly became a hassle when it came to removing them from the rest of my food. Nevertheless, it was a good dish. My friends really liked theirs too. The hummus was weird. There was a peanut buttery scent and taste which slowly became too strong. We ordered extra beef shawarma and that helped mask the peanut butter flavor.Overall, it wasn't too bad considering the Groupon deal. It's definitely not my first choice for Mediterranean food but I won't turn it down if someone suggests we go there for lunch/dinner."}, {"review_id": "Zt8AJWZuELDJPcKMlN5cHQ", "user_id": "sy1jHvjfcG2EMIXBnou21g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "This place is not bad. The biscuits are more like dessert; they taste exactly like honey graham crackers. I'd rather have an appetizer of pita bread and hummus but I understand they don't do that because not everyone likes hummus. I don't like the biscuits and usually give them to the birds.My favorites are the Mediterranean combo platter (great option as an entree too), Fattoush salad although fresh cucumber would be better than pickles, falafel, chicken Francisco sandwich, lamb kebab, and chicken and shrimp au poivre. They have fresh, steamed veggies as a side for the entrees, which I really like. I don't feel bloated or unhealthy after eating here! Only desserts I've tried are the tiramisu, which came out frozen and did not look or taste authentic, and a chocolate cake slice, where the cake layers were super dry and stale. Eat dinner here but dessert, pass.Overall, we've had wonderful service from the female servers. The food can be hit and miss. Sometimes I'd get dry falafel or overcooked chicken. For sure, this place is a healthier alternative to the same ol' chain restaurants in town."}, {"review_id": "OzTbl1vIVuZYBGRdrfamoA", "user_id": "p6D8jY4ipP3lSnZTHr8YzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/6/2016", "text": "I've been here twice and both times I had really a great experience!  The food is delicious and costumer service is wonderful.They have high quality ingredients and everything is made fresh to order - you can really taste it.  I've ordered their special which came with shrimp, chicken and beef; it's so amazing.  It's the perfect meal if you want to try every meat they offer.  I've heard great things about their lamb shanks and I plan to order them on my next visit.  I've also tried their soup of the day, it was creamy tomato basil and it was spectacular.  Their hummus was good but I wasn't a fan of their babaganoush, it just didn't have enough eggplant for my liking.

The owners and staff are the best! Very welcoming, the food is the best. My favorite is the lamb kabobs with fatoush salad. They also serve a delicious roll with meals. The first time I had one I thought, what's this? It seemed hard and dry! To my delicious surprise, it is one of the best rolls ever! Crusty outside but sweet soft deliciousness inside!  My boyfriend usually gets lamb Schwarma that comes on a bed of rice with fatoush salad. I have tried their salmon which was great. One time we stopped in and their special was a wrap filled with blackened tilapia, rice, fresh spinach (I think- it was some sort of greens, I can't remember for sure exactly what!), their marinated tomatoes and seasonings. There may have been more on it too. It was so good! We devoured it! One of the owners told us he had come in and made it for himself for his meal. He decided it was pretty good so tried it on the menu! I'm glad he did! I hope it's a regular item now! Other items I've tried are hummus, beef meat pies, dolmas (rice stuffed grape leaves), gyros..... all incredibly good!We have taken friends and family here often. I highly recommend it!!"}, {"review_id": "7mRFOFwGZvx8_z0atYz3AQ", "user_id": "cQuReZtc0lv6p7Cute823g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "This is one of the best restaurants in Wichita.
