On a recent visit, Nasir, the owner, was on the floor tending to customer's needs and sharing stories. Husband ordered the shrimp platter which was incredible. I've had just about every item on the menu and never leave hungry. We've used Lavash for catering too and had SO much food! One of my favorite items on the menu is the Spicy Black Bean Hummus and the lamb chops. They have a lovely outdoor space and the dessert case is expansive. If you don't save room for dessert, be sure to take some with you. Nasir and his crew will make you feel very welcome and part of the family."}, {"review_id": "EbHUzlL-4PqubXICMWB-_A", "user_id": "SJjdV9BS3mmD4A8KcnpcvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Columbus. Lavash is the only place to go in the city for Mediterranean food. It is especially nice in the summer when the patio is open. It's a fairly casual style of dining where you order at the counter and then pick up your tray when the buzzer goes off, but the quality of the food reflects a commitment to excellence that is anything but casual. My go-to order is the Chicken Shawarma. I clean my plate every single time. And I can't get over how good the garlic sauce is!!!!!"}, {"review_id": "xEvpYP8zUruYDz9ToUcScg", "user_id": "0WlAA3k8l0jBa67_oQYwtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "This place is probably the best Mediterranean food in Cbus! Honestly, everything is not just delicious and fresh, but the flavors of each dish are outstanding!For starters, i love their spicy black bean hummus (highly recommended). Its the perfect blend of black beans, tahini, and garlic topped evoo. And the hummus comes with their very addictive housemade pita bread.If you choose shwarmas,  kebobs, or gyros each  meat marinated with flavorful seasoning and cooked to your personal perfection preference. And somehow they can make a simple basamati rice taste amazing.I love they offer GF, vegetarian and vegan options.The food is 5 stars, but their customers service is 5+. This is demonstrated from the ever presence owner of Lavash. He is always mingling with customers, making sure their food experience is outstanding and his positive attitude and customer service concern permeates the entire restaurant.My final thoughts,  ask for a side of homemade pita bread at no extra charge.This place is also great for large groups. Theres plenty of seating in this restaurant. They have their main room plus a huge side room. Theres street parking plus lavash's private parking behind the restaurant. If you haven't been to Lavash yet....youre missing out!"}, {"review_id": "w4fe6U4uIBcOzZNtO9iotQ", "user_id": "1oRu9sCLTMXl4FG2ZxBmJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This place was awesome!

Everyone from the cooks to the servers checked in on me to make sure that my experience was not only a good one but a great one.

The service was on point and the food was exceptional. We tried a little bit of everything frankly: kabobs, hummus, rice, kibbeh and fatoush salad. We loved the fresh kabobs and variety of hummus types and the baba ghanoush. They even had an olive hummus that I'd never had before. Very creative! The kofta kabob and chicken kabobs were very juicy. The owner came out to greet us which was very nice of him. Very cool guy. We didn't get a chance to try their desserts but they had everything known in that region.

I don't know what else to say, other than the food was amazing, and what I've come to expect from Mediterranean food.My first visit here was a learning experience - you order, you get paged (buzzed) when your food is up. Because they were a little busy, they buzzed us for our hummus first, and then when our plates were ready. All-in-all - it was all wonderful and delicious, and FRESH.It's on my \"go back to\" short list when I'm craving some mediterranean."}, {"review_id": "mL63ANzOzcWpakiT5U_X7Q", "user_id": "ULPfBj9qRg8b1COCOILG4A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Didn't have any problems with the service! As for food, we ordered the lamb/beef kofta kabob entree & the chicken shawarma sandwich with pita. The kofta platter tasted good and had good flavors; the main issue was just that the quantity just wasn't really worth the ~$16 cost. I added tahini sauce to the sandwich because it only comes with garlic sauce, but the flavors were still a bit bland. The shawarma is decently priced for the quantity that you receive, I just wish there was more flavor to it and it was definitely just a bit underwhelming."}, {"review_id": "YlYqIpPAI855utzyWQrOQA", "user_id": "vDii2Ag2dmUVBycYGJtfPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Always great. If you don't have a lot of time to spare, consider ordering ahead for carry-out. I've found it can take a little while for food, no longer than any other restaurant, but the difference is that you order at the counter and then sit down, so I think that subconsciously you expect the food to be quicker than a sit and order from a waiter type of place.  I love everything here, I generally get the Chicken Shawarma, which is a rolled up type of sandwich in a pita. It's delicious. The lentil soup is also a great choice, and the hummus is amazing, they give you a heaping portion, it's so smooth and creamy. Such great hummus!Lasty, the sweets....obviously sugar is my favorite food....They have a glass case that will make anyone drool (at least, I'd like to think it's not just me!) Really great Baklavas and traditional sweets, plus some gorgeous cake and cupcakes. If you're looking for something for a date or a group, they're perfect for both, because they actually have large family style serving sizes. They also cater, which would be perfect if you want to spice up your work lunch routine. It's better than Pizza Friday, so give it a chance."}, {"review_id": "laCviYa_OZRRCWJ_76TycA", "user_id": "tgeFUChlh7v8bZFVl2-hjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/31/2017", "text": "I have made sure people know of Lavash Cafe. It has to be the best Mediterranean restaurant in Columbus. There's a lot of them. It has some very good looking and tasting food and it's still affordable. The location has a small dining area but it's convenient for takeout. I first had Lavash Cafe from its booth at Comfest. It had the best falafel we tried there so we wanted to go to the restaurant some time. The appetizer is about $3 and the sandwich is about $7. It also has good hummus. The black bean is almost as good as the regular. It goes very well with a sandwich. There are lots of vegetarian options. It's menu has a vegetarian section. The mujadara is lentils and rice topped with caramelized onions. It's about $13. They have a couple other entrees that include stuffed grape leaves and tabbouli. It's another locally owned business so it's great to support it. The owner was very friendly so that made us want to get some more. I recommend Lavash Cafe to anyone looking for cheap but good Mediterranean. It has lots of options for anyone. The falafel is needed but anything else you get here you can't go wrong."}, {"review_id": "5oyvL-sEQ_odBDCrTOaPmQ", "user_id": "0PCM8QMFWatpzBMRUVOVbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/17/2017", "text": "I gotta say, I've had some fantastic Mediterranean in Louisville but this is just as good!It was a little empty when my family and I got here just around noon. The blue paint above the cashier area reminded me of the color they would paint a fish market. LOL. Not sure what kind of theme they were going for. The walls were all painted different colors and the chair cushions were absolutely atrocious. But I digress.I ordered the chicken shawarma, while my parents orders the chicken kebabs, and my sister got the lamb and beef kefta sandwich.The price is not bad, but I'm used to getting a side with my entree for an $8 price point. Didn't matter though because that skinny pita sandwich filled me up! It felt light and the seasoning was not overpowering. My dad would've wanted more flavor, but I honestly thought it was delicious without any need of salt.Parking wasn't bad at all. They've got a private lot at the back. Tons of tables inside and outside. They also had a raised area with a few tables by some large windows. I gotta give them some points for the natural light.

Cleanliness: This is a quite clean place, but it can be better. My rating = 3/5.2. Taste: Not impressed at all. The chicken was bland. I do not like garlic or onion. Instead of garlic sauce, I asked for tahini sauce but I did not feel its taste. They offer only lettuce and tomato in the sandwich. No pickles or anything else !!! My rating = 2/53. Prices vs amount: They make the sandwich thin and long vs short and thick like other places. They charge $8 for all of their sandwiches. This price is outrageous for chicken shawarma. There is nothing in the sandwich to make it $8 value. I can go to a buffet for $10 !!! They can offer it easily for $5 as I know lots of places do that. My rating = 1/5.While waiting for my order, I noticed that their felafel sandwich is $7. There are places where I bought 12 felafels for $2 and $3 with great taste. I am wondering how they can make 4 felafels cost us $7 when they put them inside a pita bread.4. Service: Their service is well organized. You place your order and they give you a buzzer. When your food is ready, you get a buzz and pick up your order. People are friendly.

The staff is friendly and stops by and asks each customer how everything is going. You get what you pay for with the meals...I ordered a sandwich wrap. It was huge and filling. You can probably even pass on a side dish. My husband, who typically eats plates of food, found himself super full after just eat his gyro. They give you hummus and homemade pita bread with your meal. I want to warn about eating the bean hummus. It gave both of us acid reflux.

This was my second time around to Columbus and Lavash had pulled up in my google maps search. A high positive score with near 700 reviews left no doubt that I must visit this place. As I write this, I do realize that although I write my reviews in Yelp, I mostly search using Google maps as it's most convenient. Would be great if Yelp and Google can collaborate...or maybe not as we don't want google to gobble up everything. Anyway, back to the food. The friendly gentleman, and I use that word for its true meaning, offered up his recommendation that the chops are best. Today they had Mansef as a special and I suggested that to my colleague as he never had that before. It is then  that I learned that Mansef (A Jordanian dish) traditionally comes with lamb shoulder cuts and not a lamb Shank, which is what I had been having all this time. The owners are Palestinians and by default no one can be more Jordanian than them to have authentic knowledge about these matters. So what about the food? No words to describe how good the food was. The lamb chops were exquisite and judging from how my colleague was digging into Mansef, it's a safe bet it was great too. However, the biggest takeaway, food wise, was the black bean Humus we received on the house. Until today I had no idea such a culinary delight even existed. It had a delicate kick in it...I believe Oregano. I tried to get the recipe but the owner was not there. But I did get a smart and funny answer to my recipe request that made us all laugh and enjoy even more. We finished up with Turkish coffee, could have been stronger, along with Cheese Baklava and again an on the house Nimora for desert. Both very good but latter was exceptional."}, {"review_id": "zz4JWKoUh4bvkMuwil27cQ", "user_id": "KF0hW0wSA8nexiYRvhV6WQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Shawarma, gyros, and baklava, oh my.

Everything was flavorful and delicious. However, the best part was the pistachio baklava. We even stopped in this weekend to get more. We also got the cheese baklava and walnut baklava - and they gave us the mini pieces to try as well, which were amazing and we will definitely get next time. They have a really good variety of baklava, and what I really like is that even though they are sweet, the ones I've tried at Lavash haven't been over the top sweet like others I've had have been."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/lavash-cafe-columbus?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
