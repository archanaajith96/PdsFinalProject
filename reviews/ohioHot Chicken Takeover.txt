The reviews don't lie here people - the place is as good as it gets. Aside from the delicious chicken and free sweet tea, lets talk about this BANANA PUDDING. OMG. I could eat it all day everyday! It's seriously amazing.  The tables are picnic tables so you are forced to sit pretty close to strangers since the place is always busy but you may not be there long because the food will most likely be consumed quickly. If I had to pick one thing to complain about it would be the plain white bread they use - this could be replaced with a bun or roll to make the sandwich better. Overall, I love their mission, food, atmosphere and BANANA PUDDING."}, {"review_id": "aTDzY9Qq3dVAgk93gyQvqw", "user_id": "r6asipekgaiGMnLETz76yQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So I have been off work this week for a little staycation R&R and today seemed like a nice day to tool around the Short North. I had originally planned to head to Bakersfield for lunch but I had an internal battle the whole way there, thinking, \"Tacos sound good but I'll be near HTC so maybe I should go there? No, tacos it is. No, maybe chicken. Hot chicken! No, tacos and guac. Ugh! Just drive.\" Made the split decision and peeled into the North Market parking lot. I arrived at 11:35 and headed upstairs. Much to my dismay, the line into HTC was already at least 200 people deep, but at least the line was moving. So I waited. When I thought I was close to getting in the door, I overheard someone say that the line wrapped all the way around the inside too. So I decided to place a carry out order from my phone. It said it would be ready by 12:15. Cool. I went and did some other shopping in the market, came back at 12:10. Order wasn't ready. Waited 20 more minutes. Still not ready. Then the sweet guy at the carry out counter told me that today is their 4th anniversary and all these people came for their $5 meal. Well, no wonder! Finally, around 12:50 my meal was ready, and for my inconvenience, they gave me a free meal voucher for my next visit. Score!I do have to say that the chicken was so worth the wait! I got a wing meal, hot spice, and it was perfect. Honestly this is the best fried chicken I've had in ages, and the hot level was perfect. The sides were fine but it was all about the juicy chicken and that white bread (I know it's just plain old cheap white bread, but it soaks up the spice from the chicken and adds the perfect \"something\" to the meal). I'll be back to claim that free meal soon! So worth it!!"}, {"review_id": "EOxaX4-cQi_yrS2_6CP8Kw", "user_id": "nzerMPNpnUPvDXGJOSolZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Didnt know what to expect bc ive heard of nashville hot chicken but wasn't particularly interested. imMore of a heat& sweet kinda fried chicken girl (think the Eagle)But clearly I slept on this place... think the hype & line may have turned me away or kept me at bay. Buut in the spirit of being a good tourist/newbie a colleague wanted to take me to lunch so I said let's go to your favorite place  .. it was chilly and the friday of final 4 ncaa weekend but well worth the walk to North Market (super cute & is nicer  and more thoughtful than Findlay Market in Cincinnati & Chelsea Market - esque in NY)... anyway we get upstairs & i have no idea of what to expect. I see a long azz line,And a number on the wall indicative of how much chicken is remaining.  im usually a wing/ drumstick kinda dried chicken girl but When in rome order as the romans do for the full experience. Not too shabby. Had  darkMeat mild and i was shocked by how full i was and hoe much i enjoyed the mac n cheese & slaw & the FREE sweet tea. That was a nice touch & mine was fresh STILL HOT !! umm the chicken was seasoned sooo well and while i thought the hot sauce would make it a bit of a soggy mess it was actually just delightful plus / minus a few dips of fresh made ranch dressing. The mac & cheese perfectly salted and while I didnt eat much of it the slaw was on point. Next time id definitely go wings/drums bc those r my preferences and quite frankly a drum is easier to clean meat off the bone :). I cannot imagine that place in the summer or the weekend. Loved the open style seating and that they \"serve\" at your table so to speak.Give it a go... its not too shabby.

So you can online order and pick up. I dined in so I went to the register and ordered. Since I was food venturing, I didn't get the meal. I just got the chicken. 5 piece wings. You can mix and match the heat level! What!!!!!! How convenient! So I got 3 warm and 2 hot. I didn't want to even touch the holy. After ordering, you seat yourself. It's community style here. Then someone will yell out your name while holding your food when it's ready. So the chicken tasted as I expected. I thought it would wow me more. You can definitely taste the spices. I feel like with hot chicken, you need some salt lol. I noticed that with all the hot chickens but maybe that's how it's supposed to be! Warm was good. Not spicy. Give you a tiny tingle but barely. Then I tried hot. Hot actually wasn't that hot to me at all. My nose ran a little bit but my mouth was still not stinging and such. Maybe because I started off with the medium. I should've gotten the holy. But the chicken was still juicy! And crispy skin. I think I would have to come back before heading back home."}, {"review_id": "k1vG8jgfyPZJhhL-yboXWw", "user_id": "zN3kkIyZ8IhbZXawvnz6gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "So good!

No one minded waiting for their delicious chicken!My husband and I split an order of 4 drumsticks in the mild flavor. Their tea sounded good, unfortunately we'd forgotten to order any drink so our mouths were pretty hot after each bite!We liked the community style seating, and there was lots of room for everyone!The girl calling out names on the to-go orders was quick and would bring out several boxes at a time for everyone who ordered to-go.

I ordered online, which was CLEARLY the best option and when I walked in, my order was ready as promised. The chicken was hot, juicy, and had just the right spices to it! You can pick your poison when it comes to the sauce, I got hot and I would give it a level 4-5 spiciness. You get free water, iced tea, or sweet tea with your order, and you gotta remember the ranch and napkins, you will need plenty of both. As far as the meal goes... I will give the chicken 5 Stars, easily! Any restaurant that is cooking this much chicken on a daily basis and has the consistency in taste, I have to bow down to them. Amazing job! I'm not a slaw guy by any means, so I got double Mac and cheese... I would give that 3 Stars, it needed a little more flavor for my taste buds. All that being said, I feel obligated to give HCT five stars for their amazing service, efficiencies, as well as their game changing chicken!

Luckily, if you're not very tolerant to spice like me, Hot Chicken Takeover works out nicely.I actually tried the Warm level and my nose didn't run...so I think I could have handled the actual 'hot' chicken. I got the boneless chicken over waffles to make it a classic 'chicken and waffles' type of meal. Pretty tasty and filling. It's a great rendition to the Nashville favorite.The restaurant is located on the second floor of the North Market. The dining area is an expansive room full of long lunch tables. Reminds me of a cafeteria with all the communal seating. You order at the counter and they're pretty quick in getting the food to you. I'm always smiling when I get fried chicken. Be sure to grab some napkins and get comfy at one of the tables to chow down at.

It is so much of a popular spot that when I arrived around 12:30pm on a Thursday, they were already sold out of wings. I am not kidding you at all, they were completely sold out of wings before it hit 1. Needless to say I was heartbroken and disappointed, but because I had stood on the line for 30mins (Yes, THIRTY!)? I decided to order the breast in warm heat. The breast was on top of some bread and was served with Mac and cheese and cole slaw. I found the skin to be very crispy and the warm had just the right kick of spice for those of us who don't like super spicy food. The outside parts of the chicken were juicy but I found the inside to be less tender and juicy. I opted out of cole slaw but the Mac was pretty good. It isn't your grandmas souther Mac, and was a little too cheesy for me, but overall it was bearable. They also offer sweetened and unsweetened tea at no additional charge, which is amazing. Seating is a punch of community style benches so be prepared to sit very close to others. Hopefully I can come back and try the wings the next time I'm in Columbus. And hopefully the line isn't 30 minutes long!"}, {"review_id": "wJr7Il-7QXC8zhgPvaGuxQ", "user_id": "QbEAG9_7DO9fWKpHyYLroA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Good chicken for sure.

I love a place with a limited menu, doing their thing and doing it right. The chicken was amazing, tried it boneless and warm because I was scared to order hot and it was the perfect amount of spice. Possibly the best mac and cheese I've ever had. The slaw is just ok- something about the taste was just off- but I ate it :) Best banana pudding I've ever had for sure- that's the real deal. Totally worth getting fat. Sweet tea is no joke, I mixed it halfsies with unsweet and that was perfect-and can't beat that's it's free. My preschooler loved the mac and cheese and zero spice fried chicken. After eating here, I googled it and read about their hiring practices with people with records and I'm even more glad I gave them my business and plan on it going forward.
