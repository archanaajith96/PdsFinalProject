I had the 1st ave burger with nothing added to it, one of the best burgers I have had.

My favorite burger is the classic with American cheese added and the Cajun chips (they're made in house - right in front of you) with chipotle ranch dipping sauce.

The bun is sweet and soft, so it matches the cooked patty. Fresh cut chips were better than the fries. (Salt it yourself unless you like heavy salt). All in all, I won't say \"if you visit Fargo, you have to try this burger,\" but the place is cozy with good beer, so if you need a good beer in Fargo, try JL. IF you visit, have a burger too."}, {"review_id": "5IKPWcm_L2uHS6CCkmFlsA", "user_id": "3QKIvlsAO2yULWyQ1H6TPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "Best burgers in Fargo!!

Love this place! The footprint is small, but doesn't feel cramped, the service is excellent, fast and friendly and the music is on point.The Rajun Cajun burger is cooked perfect, presented like a gourmet restaurant at a Big Mac price. Really impressive.Beers: lots of tap options and a good variety for all. Surly Furious? Pentagram? Check. Check.Bells Two Hearted? Oberon? Check. Check.Southern Tier Thick Mint? Check.If you're looking for a place to take the buddies or the missus without breaking the bank or looking like a fool when the service and selection is crap, this is the place. My only knock is the lack of wings for appetizer (but I'll live).And they give you postcards and mail them home for you? Seriously? Love this place!!Come here, congratulate yourself on a great decision, then give it a five star rating."}, {"review_id": "NQv4i6oUsRn0Fz4z5-wq6A", "user_id": "Cj1k8zkMFrBs2SbnPGDTHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/12/2015", "text": "Stopped here for lunch on a Sunday while in Fargo for one night. This is a small place with friendly staff and good burgers and fries. We shared a burger and loaded fries and they were nice enough to split it and put it on two separate plates without us having to ask. I found the burger a tad too salty, but it might just be me since I don't like very salty foods. They also have an excellent beer selection. Another interesting thing they do here is that they give you postcards which you can fill out to anyone and they will put a stamp on it and mail it for you!  We filled out two to send to my son at overnight camp. I thought that was a really nice touch!"}, {"review_id": "LiM_6_apPcbCiIpevuOh8g", "user_id": "dQ0baCtVYs9gydTprFkaow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2016", "text": "We met some friends for lunch today.

The place was clean, but pretty tiny. Luckily, it was not very crowded on a Saturday afternoon so we got seats at the bar - the tables were all filled (grated there were maybe 3 or 4, I can't remember). The menu is pretty basic. Burgers, fries, sauces. I got the Humpty Dumpty burger - burger with a fried egg and cheese. And that was literally it. To get anything like lettuce or tomato on it cost money. Now I get the idea, but I wanted an egg and vegetables on my burger and the only way to do that was to pay more. I think charging for lettuce and tomato is a bit of a stretch - maybe an egg or mushrooms, extras like that. Or maybe I'm a traditionalist, who knows. Either way, the burgers came out quickly, it was good, but it definitely needed more. I also got the fresh hand-cut fries, and those were definitely tasty. My brother got the fresh chips which were also really good. I honestly don't remember the burgers he or the husband got but they both seemed to enjoy it. So why the three stars? I don't know, maybe it was end of vacation blues, or tiredness or what, but this place just wasn't really up my alley. If I want a burger I want a big juicy burger with lots of toppings - so if that's what you like, I wouldn't recommend this place. If you like the diner/slider style burger with minimal toppings, this is your place. I do wish I had felt up to having a beer because the selection seemed pretty okay and it is probably a nice hangout to have a beer and chat with a friend.Oh also, the music was really good."}, {"review_id": "zAngZ-2S9Rsxw3nsTSCrYA", "user_id": "wqIvL3f8leDOpWeEHbLeXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/1/2016", "text": "Stopped in Fargo to overnight on a long road trip.  Forgot how we found out about JL Beers, but we did and we went, and we are huge fans!  Yes the place is small, but the energy is good.  Everyone working there appeared to be happy to be there, happy to serve you, and happy that you were there.  A refreshing change.Cheeseburgers are simply the best.  I am a big Five Guys fan, but JL Beers tops that easily.  Very fresh, simple, well prepared and tasty!  Fresh cut fries are great, and we were pleasantly surprised that our split order had been divided onto each of our plates.  The postcards are also a nice touch - how did they know I was from Chicago?  :-)Wish there was a JL Beers closer to home.  Oh yeah, and the on-tap beer selection is very good!  Something to please everyone."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/jl-beers-fargo?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
