The chicken tinga queso dip is one of the best appetizers I've had maybe ever. Creamy, just enough spice, absolutely perfect in every sense of the word. The liter of margaritas gives you the best bang for your buck if you're planning on having more than just one, striking the perfect balance between sweet and sour. Make sure you try the al pastor tacos topped with lime cabbage as well. Adds great crunch and sweetness to the well grilled meat.The atmosphere here is upscale without being stuffy, and the staff is incredibly well trained. Great date night spot. Our waiter knew the menu, providing excellent recommendations while providing top notch service without being pushy. I'm not in Indy often but would absolutely return to Nada in a heartbeat."}, {"review_id": "lg9I10EsX0wWrxnTERTDpg", "user_id": "iQ7PKAsv2pxDE-3MzSwuKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Very cool atmosphere with lots of interesting textures and lighting. It's communal seating so be prepared to potentially share your table with strangers. Resist that midwestern urge to leave a seat between you and the next person and just embrace it. :DFood is always tasty with lots of fusion varieties. The mac and cheese is PHENOMENAL and I really cannot say enough good about it. I always get an order to go to take home to my husband or for myself for later in the week. My only complaint is that the servers are pretty aloof and disinterested -- like they're too cool to be there. I've been here about half a dozen times and in those times, I have had one pleasant server. They should probably spend a little more time training up their wait staff on hospitality basics to quickly curtail this. The service isn't bad, it's just not friendly. Not enough to prevent me from coming back."}, {"review_id": "zB6drxlV4xTopcHemggHMQ", "user_id": "XD571nhbTtv2vE08iRWzEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "The food and drinks do not disappoint!

It's not authentic Mexican but their twist on traditional dish makes this place a step above other Mexican places. And the service was great also, we had Eva as our waitress and she was very attentive. We started with their chips and salsa trio and build your own queso with tingy which was amazing. They give you 3 salsas ranging in spiciness all which are delicious. I really liked the hottest one is really good. Each of us ordered different tacos so we would try them all. We ordered the chicken al carbon, the avocado and pork belly taco with fried egg on top. The pork belly taco has amazballs the chicken al carbon wasn't the best, compared to the other tacos it didn't have much flavor compared to the others. We finished with the churros, there super light and fluffy so not your traditional  churro. They also serve them with salted Carmel and chocolate dipping sauce which take the dessert to another level. Only thing that would of made them better is putting more cinnamon sugar on them because ours hardly had any."}, {"review_id": "-YhjPe6FDKLnMa-Sx2_3rw", "user_id": "_Pp-BAbAK_Tnp32g8uqsbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I may be in love with this restaurant. I don't know that I've ever walked into a place where I loved the decor so much. The interior designer of this place deserves a medal. I loved every aspect of the space. Especially all the curvy booths. It made it feel warm and inviting and just being in there made me happy. I wish I owned this place. Also there is an action figure diorama over the urinals in the men's room. Service was excellent and attentive, like what you see at very fine restaurants. The waiter immediately asked about any dietary needs or restrictions and though we had none his proactive approach boded well for the service we would receive. I had the Mexican poutine which is an appetizer with I think pork and potatoes and quest an fried egg on top. It was great. I also had the enchiladas, which were excellent. There are these cute little corked flask hot sauces on the table. Another classy touch. I used some green for extra heat. I was able to sample the queso from someone else and it was delicious and rich. The chips were a little small for my liking. Too many broken. Another diner at our table had the pork belly tacos and he came down with what we think was food poisoning later that night. I can't think what it could have been from here. I hesitate to even mention it because everyone else was fine. Maybe what he had for lunch elsewhere? Theoretically nothing in the pork belly tacos is a risky food to eat. Nada is probably not to blame for his troubles. I do wish the enchiladas had been a little bigger. But I am a big guy, they are probably enough for a normal sized human.For desert I had this chocolate cake with bananas foster ice cream. Just wonderful. It was small but the perfect size to satisfy that sweet tooth without feeling like overindulging. I would definitely return."}, {"review_id": "Ly01FeFVQHw8n3VdjEbqdQ", "user_id": "b-Va9nfqCFcaLTQIuPgpiQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is an update to a previous review.FYI the large plate option really is more like an adult plate.

When you first walk in, the ambiance and the colorful wall painting immediately attracts your eyes. My friends and I followed the hostess to a booth table, and felt immediately very secluded because of the privacy we got in the booth! Our server came to greet us right away, and asked if it was our first time. He introduced us to the menu and then walked away to get our drinks started while giving us some time. Since my friends have been here before, I let them take charge in ordering. We ordered the \"make your own queso\" and added avocados, grilled peppers, and choizo. For the tacos, we ordered 1) Baja Fish, 2) Crispy Pork Belly topped with an Egg, 3) Shrimp, and 4) Grilled Salmon. I preferred them in this order. And let me tell you about the baja fish, it was probably the best fish tacos I've ever had in my life! IT WAS THAT GOOD! Not only do they do their tacos right, their potatoes is very unique and interesting too, but in a very good way. The effort Nada puts in their decorations, service, and the quality of their food is easily felt. Although the meal came out to be slightly on the pricier side than I had expected, I was very happy with my experience at Nada overall, and I am looking forward to having another reason to come back to Indianapolis so I can come to Nada again!"}, {"review_id": "ayHDz6fd1frqC7FeE-tjyg", "user_id": "Wrehb3W5UNHYECIDnyx5Zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Good food, listen to your bartender/server and get the egg.Clean and friendly establishment."}, {"review_id": "htsLSB-ENoXAeNZh_tC3Lg", "user_id": "8VGBTuOayGboYguPOaHwhA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I was in town for a conference and had to act quick to make sure the regular people did not have me eating at a chain restaurant.  I am not going to TG-Apple-Chill-Road-olive-anything.  When you are in a new city... go see what the city has to offer.  Okay... enough of my soap box.  Nada was able to accommodate the group.  Can I tell you.  The house margarita is THA business.  I should have gotten that 3rd drink.  Don't judge me.  I wasn't driving.  We started off with chips, salsa, and guac.  The \"Keeper\" salsa was a table favorite.  I told them to stop eating all the chips and salsa and save it for the food.  The table had various tacos and everyone said that they were very good.  I had the skirt steak.  The steak was a nice cut and cooked very well.  But....

If you're looking for a great restaurant to have a nice meal, this is it. It's conveniently located downtown and a lovely place to have dinner. It's Mexican but with a twist. They describe themselves as a \"taco and cocktail joint\". So what do they have? Oh, just some creative menu items that I love - such as their \"Nada fries\", now known as \"Chili Glaze Crispy Potatoes\". This is their version of fries (fried potato stopped with a chili glaze, scallions and a sour cream). Yum. For starters, there's the chips and salsa trio which is nice to try because they have house made salsa that is different from the standard. Did I mention the guacamole? Yes, you need to try that too. Yes. The build your own queso was a hit as well. Delicious. The tacos are a la carte and not very big, so choose what you want and make sure you pick a variety. They are around $4-$5 each, so you can make a meal out of them. I have tried almost all of them, and I believe the pork (al pastor) was my favorite. The bar and drinks are wonderful and bartenders very friendly and knowledgeable. So refreshing.Do me a favor and stop in.

The atmosphere is really neat and definitely worth stopping in for even if you aren't a big taco fan. We started with the chips and salsa which included 3 different kinds of salsa. My favorite was the yellow creeper salsa which had a growing heat while not too spicy with great flavor. All 3 salsas mixed together were also great! I ordered the Nadarita which is made completely from scratch. It was delicious, but not your typical margarita so definitely do not go in expecting anything that will taste similar to a typical mexican restaurant. I ordered the Mu Shu tacos which were amazing and I would definitely order it again. My husband got the Al Pastor which had good flavor but were pretty skimpy compared to my order, so I would not recommend those if you're hungry.

Lastly, this was the restaurant that I brought my SO other to when he visited me from San Diego for his birthday. Nada is great to celebrate events without breaking the bank.The ambiance is truly one of a kind. You're greeted with color and decor that's so interesting that even their restrooms are art. The customer service is always good and they're very attentive with addressing your concerns and refilling drinks.The food is pretty good too. They're definitely not authentically Mexican, but they've taken Mexican-inspired food and elevated it. I looove the pork belly tacos and their mixed drinks. The chips and salsa are so addictive that you'll be asking for refills.If you're looking for a restaurant that's a little more of a \"special occasion but still kind of casual\" vibe, you should definitely come here.

It was a very large bowl (exhibit A my photo) and I had enough left to go with the tacos as the main course. So moving on, it was feeling like a pork night. While the pork belly was tempting, Al Pastor delivered the message and church was in session! The chili-marinated pork--mmm--like an appealing alter-call. And the pineapple was indeed hospitable while not overwhelming. The extra guacamole paired nicely too. I'm a believer.All I needed was some room for dessert.

Drinks/food came out quick and we never had to wait long for a marg refill. I had three tacos and a sweet potato rice side dish. All were amazing! The pork belly taco is by far the best. So much flavor in one little taco. I will say it is more on the pricier side.  I paid $5 a taco... that is a little much for what you get, but the flavor is amazing so it makes up for it.
