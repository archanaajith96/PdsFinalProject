When my daughter reminded me it was not far from COSI, in the German Village. Only two spots but a parking lot across the street. Such a beautiful setup. Help yourself to water and utensils. Too many good things to choose for breakfast that we stayed and shared a few things. The frangipane was my favorite. A nice balanced flavors with a delicious crust. The lemon is my second favorite - not overly tart, but lemony with lovely graham crust. The chocolate raspberry flourless was so rich and thick, I could definitely not eat one on my own. For breakfast we took away an almond croissant, chocolate croissants, and coffee twists. All a hit! Lovely flavor and flaky goodness. Bookmarked now so I don't forget!"}, {"review_id": "hKwXsXMaHjZgq8l9SH9YhQ", "user_id": "JS32wKB5SZmLi6XWmrnFiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "A little taste of France in German VillageI have visited the lovely coffee shop/bakery twice in one month.  I love the atmosphere and decor.  The coffee was delicious and the selection of pastries is wonderful.  In addition they have a great selection of macarons that are wonderful.  The texture is to die for.They also offer some fabulous selections of brunch dishes.I plan to head back there as soon as I can."}, {"review_id": "a97kPKeGYLEjPHFgtLkMNg", "user_id": "rjsM6PW8tvKA9rNhVpoP1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Delighted to have visited this spot.

They rotate some of the flavors so always check back for new ones!"}, {"review_id": "aUF3edTiByvsRaPO_eQlXA", "user_id": "JKSb0GEs81uYb3rt91flcA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "TREAT YO SELF.This cozy bakery has a modern urban vibe.

The flavors are unique and offered everyone in our group an opportunity to be happy.We also shared a $4 eclair, while I felt it was small in size the quality made up for it and provided each of the 4 of us a nice sized bite each of which I might add included the luscious cream.Out lemon tart was tart and delicious.The crust was made from the shortbread cookies they sell in the shop, it was good But prepare for it to be a little extra crumbly being that it was made from the cookie.

Ok, well we found this by walking south from Katzinger's deli and decided a hot drink and sweets would be the perfect start to Sunday Funday. There were not many tables open, but managed to snag a two top, so yay (jump on a table right away if you plan to stay!). Started by musing over the macarons and the cakes and the croissants and the brioche and.... Well you get the idea, they have lots of amazing options! I finally settled on the orange brioche, for something different, and a lemon macaron (needed to try their signature!) and a macchiato. My companion got an almond croissant and an espresso.I liked both of my treats, although I think I would have preferred the chocolate croissant with the coffee. The almond croissant was reported to be very, very butyraceous, so make sure you are wanting a heavy item if you get that.Service was friendly and the area clean.Minus one star for price and noise levels (hard to control, I know).If you want a sweet treat and you are in the area, you can't go wrong here!"}, {"review_id": "eUFeVwZbjc5tpOuxbtwYfw", "user_id": "_ZxqGLjPcthCRNb3OXlrmQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "This is a great afternoon stop if you're in German village. If you can find parking, that is. And if there's any seating left. Those two aspects are always a gamble but everything else is a solid A+. I got the iced mocha and mascarpone pistachio dacquoise to eat at one of the little tables outside. Very good food and drink but a little on the pricey side. I got some macarons to go, the variety of flavors was impressive and temping enough to make you spend a lot of money. The macaron quality was good but not the best I've ever had. I'd stick to the cakes and other treats next time. Service is friendly, the shop is clean and relaxing. Bathrooms are well kept. There's plenty in walking distance if manage to find parking and don't want to leave right away."}, {"review_id": "e9ozz-2qMhMNB48RjwYw9g", "user_id": "kMezfzGwurhpSitYGx2Bfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Ummmm the chocolate bomb was delicious!

After eating the almond croissant today, I can easily see why it made the cut.1.) This spot is tucked in the adorable historic German Village. I'd gladly live in any of the homes found in this neighborhood - it reminds me of my historic neighborhood in Indianapolis. Do yourself a favor after picking up a sweet treat and roam the neighborhood. You'll earn your dessert with every step ;)2.) The space and patio are a fine balance of sleek yet inviting.3.) The pastry case is very clean and well marked with pan au raisins, classic croissants, macaroons, fresh baked breads and dainty and beautiful desserts (pistachio strawberry dacquoise for us).4.) The patio with tables/umbrellas is prime real estate if you have your pup along for the ride like we did.5.) Again, if you're a fan of almond croissants - don't leave without grabbing one."}, {"review_id": "zpkTITbw_JLkiS2GptbMVg", "user_id": "47tgaej5CAmBCPGi2svPfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Wow wow wow wow wow. Can I live here?I've tried their delicious made-in-house croissants, which were so flaky and heavenly. Their almond croissants were probably my favorite...the best I've ever tried. I've also had their hot and iced lattes. Their espresso is very strong, but delicious. They really know how to steam milk well. I recommend using the honey water for flavoring. It adds just a hint of sweetness.The staff is very knowledgeable and proficient. Even with long lines, you get through quickly. There's both outdoor and indoor seating, and it's in an old but beautiful part of town. They also have AMAZING desserts: fresh macarons, pastries, cakes...I haven't yet tried them, but I definitely plan to!"}, {"review_id": "OSJ_C5zpTYnVEFp7C_xSvg", "user_id": "NvlXsXC62kD2vzmd0Vanxw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "I love love love this cute little bakery and cafe!  I stopped at Pistachia Vera during a trip to Columbus because I'm a huge macaron fan and had heard that they had the best. I was delighted by the variety they had. They varied from traditional to some more creative flavors. I took home a dozen and tried a good selection and everyone was delicious. What made the experience even better though was the staff. They were friendly and took time to have a conversation while they served every customer. My only caution is that they're very busy and the establishment is small so there may be a wait.

I can only do decaf, and I've often had major brew envy for all of the people who so lovingly sip their cold brews. Now it was my turn. And, FWIW, no, decaf iced americano does not taste nearly as smooth as cold brew. It's comparing a Wendy's frosty to gelato. Back  to Pistacia Vera: the space is bright, clean, and lovely. Staff is friendly and welcoming. The coffee accoutrements are beyond expected, including honey water, which I now want every damn day of my life. They do not have wifi, so keep that in mind if/when you need to bust out your laptop. I didn't sample any of the gorgeous pastries or macarons but it's on my list for next time. Until then, I'm going to keep that decaf cold brew memory top of mind. #memories"}, {"review_id": "ORaTKMeJpXsOCLjBk_3Tgg", "user_id": "xBFjaDhJnoEzBEgeIbuKig", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "This was such a welcome stop to make after the long drive.

The cortados were well balanced and didn't have too much milk; I enjoyed the flavor of the espresso.The baked goods were all tasty, but the palmier was the resounding favorite.
