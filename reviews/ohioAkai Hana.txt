Finally made it out here for a little dinner. Walking in, you could tell the place was going to be bomb by how busy it was. A ton of Asians so you knew you couldn't go wrong...this place was legit. The decor was clean with what you would expect for a Midwest Japanese establishment. For the two of us, we maybe went slightly overboard but it was totally worth it. We ordered the seaweed salad, stone bowel bibimbap bowl, several pieces of nigiri, and a few specialty rolls (Tuna bliss A, red dragon roll, and I think an explosion roll). Seawood salad tasted fresh. I loved how the light amount of sesame oil really enhanced the flavor of the seawood. I'm usually not a fan of bibimbap, but this was some of the best ever. The hot bowl got the rice nice and crispy. The slight amount of gochujang really made it on another level. The nigiri was amazing. I loved how the eel didn't have too much sauce to overpower the flavor. The fatty tuna was probably my favorite cut. The rolls were good. Not doused with too much sauce and several of the rolls had cuts of fish, which is different for most sushi establishments that mostly use shrimp or crab. It is a bit on the pricier side, but definitely worth the price. This place is great for a date night or bringing family and friends from out of town. I'll be back for sure."}, {"review_id": "ghLMafUNRuMPHaQyQLmx7g", "user_id": "V6vcX3p3MF819kffiUKLZw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Curious Serving Methods, Somewhat DisappointedAkai Hana is reasonably priced when compared to Japanese counterparts like Kihachi, so it draws plenty of traffic.  I've frequently shopped at Tensuke and like it a lot, but Akai Hana was pretty disappointing.Ordered the hiyayakko (cold tofu); shrimp-vegetable tempura; and the sukiyaki.  The tempura was pretty decent, but the other two were served in odd (incorrect) ways that detracted from their flavor.Hiyayakko is chilled tender tofu, dusted with scallions, ginger, and katsuobushi, drizzled with soy sauce.  What I got was tofu that was at least medium-firm tofu, surrounded by ice cubes, and with the toppings on the side.  The ice cubes pretty much ruined everything.  When they were firm, I was parrying them with my chopsticks to get at the tofu; when they melted, I couldn't swirl my tofu around to gather up soy sauce and the aromatic mix because the ice water had diluted everything.  And medium-firm/firm tofu should be used in stir fries or mapo tofu, not in hiyayakko.Sukiyaki consists of strips of raw beef and a lot of veggies in a shallow pot, cooked in a broth of soy sauce, mirin, and sake.  In the menu, they looked great as they were portrayed as uncooked.  Perhaps I should've known better, but it was not served in a way that would allow you to cook it yourself at the table, but rather already cooked.  I understand the logistics behind that, but what that meant was that the beef was already starting to get a bit tough.  more annoyingly, the veggies were all soaked in soy sauce and sugary mirin, which is a bit too sweet for me.I understand the need to accommodate different tastes and levels of culinary knowledge, but how Akai Hana chose to serve the hiyayakko and sukiyaki was really curious from purely a flavor standpoint.Service was good, and my server was kind enough to oblige my request for a raw egg (to be mixed, used for dipping the sukiyaki).  No complaints there.  But how the kitchen chooses to prepare and serve its food was very disappointing."}, {"review_id": "6pYY_d3uNoayv_ivUqobuA", "user_id": "hynntqWawpXPvZboYdjWHQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "This as quickly become one of my favorite sushi spots!

During my last visit, my girlfriend and I ordered the Party Boat for 2. This was the most amazing display of sushi I've ever seen - the boat was nearly too large for the table, and the sushi/nigiri was arranged beautifully on the boat. There was a large variety of both sushi and nigiri, and it was all delicious with the exception of the ika (squid), which was a little too rubbery for our liking. If we ordered this again, we would definitely ask to swap the ika for something different. As an added treat, we received a small bowl of three different ice creams - the Green Tea flavor was my favorite!Our server, Shukri, was very attentive and helpful in explaining the options with the party boat (we didn't know what some of the words meant!). I strongly recommend making a reservation; there were a lot of people waiting for a table when we arrived for our reservation."}, {"review_id": "CCF6DiSJoQxFf53nnkjQ9Q", "user_id": "-QGrGbK2VqkiwG6hekWmzA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "It's like walking into a restaurant in Kyoto. Beautiful setup, lots of wood, very authentic Japanese feel. I was here for lunch and sat at the sushi bar. I tried 3 items. The king crab roll, spicy tuna soy paper hand roll and Tororossa roll. They were all freshly prepared and well made. First time I tried king crab in sushi and I think the delicate flavor of the crab is lost with all the rice. The hand roll was prefect and the Tororossa was intricate and well made. Overall the service was great, the quality of ingredients was excellent and I left with a happy belly.Will be back when I am in this part of town again."}, {"review_id": "dDpX0G-qm7r6jKnB5QDLkQ", "user_id": "e3dB20TG6xCoxXQdmq_VFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Came here last night and it was everything I hoped for and more. I'm picky when it comes to fresh fish and akai Hana hit the spot. I ordered a sushi boat that serves 2-3 people for me and one other person. We eat a lot so we ended up eating the whole boat lol but ended up in a food coma afterwards. Perfect size for 3 people. Every single piece of fish was so fresh and all the cuts were good as well. If you're new to sake and want to try, I suggest trying some of the sparkling sakes. They're very sweet and easy to drink. Service was attentive and not overbearing. Great experience. It felt like I was in Tokyo lol."}, {"review_id": "uUugnLGt05iB9vj7iUifHg", "user_id": "1RQaXb0xSLsUzwJ0u4uZ-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I was in Columbus for the day and had a sudden desire for a sushi lunch! Akai Hana was the closest to me with decent reviews so I decided to check the place out. Honestly it was a great choice because located at a small center with Japanese shops the vibe was awesome! There was always a daily bento lunch special (amazing deal by the way) and I ordered the special with salmon! The bento comes with a roll, rice, miso soup AND salad for less than $15!! The staff were all very friendly and I got my food pretty quickly! Quality was decent for the price that I was paying! Parking can be an issue on the weekends because it's a popular spot but weekdays for lunch was no problem at all. Definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants to check out a good sushi place in Columbus!"}, {"review_id": "fH3OENNoKP88y7yQzjRS2Q", "user_id": "TGSi0e7-ovol_PBIQgodOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "This is a very good Japanese restaurant conveniently located in Kenny Center surrounded by wonderful Asian stores, bakery, and supermarket. AmbianceFairly spacious interior with tables and booths including a couple of very large round tables for families.  Modern and tasteful decor with a classy Asian theme throughout. ServiceWe were sort of encouraged to sit at the sushi bar though there were lots of tables available, and we opted for a table. It gradually became more and more crowded, and there was a wait for tables when we left around 730pm. The server was friendly and attentive. It took a fairly long time for the food to arrive, and the server was very apologetic about that. It seemed the kitchen was overwhelmed and running behind. FoodThe food was tasty and of very good quality. We tried the wasabi shumai as a starter; it was a unique take on the usual shumai with a nice wasabi kick. Also tried the veggie croquette which was crispy outside and soft and hot inside. Both very good!  For entrees we had the chicken katsu and the nabeyaki (hot pot udon with shrimp tempura). The katsu came with a soup or salad and white or brown rice. Opted for the salad which was small and had what seemed to be a French dressing (no choice was offered). The brown rice was moist and very good. The katsu was fairly tender inside and crunchy outside, and it came with two good sized breasts. The nabeyaki was also very good; hot, tasty, and flavorful. There didn't seem to be a dessert menu, and the server didn't mention it. Overall the price was around $45 for the meal with two soft drinks before tip. MojoOverall a very good authentic Japanese restaurant with a pleasant environment and tasty and high quality food though service was slow this night."}, {"review_id": "lzXy1u8FwkUQf0XeX_FVtw", "user_id": "ByGCK7XjEqDPZu8Nk_xwVw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "I don't get it. This is not good sushi. I have gone to Akai Hana three times, each time thinking maybe I just came on an off night. I read the reviews and I keep thinking I'm missing something or ordering the wrong item, but I'm still unimpressed. The sushi rice is always dry and the rolls fall apart in front of you. The knife work is messy and the quality of fish doesn't seem anything more than average. I have been disappointed every time I've gone. The katsu don on the other hand was delightful--saucy, loaded with egg, and topped with a tender yet crispy cutlet. The bowl came with various accompaniments. This is one of the better katsu don dishes I've consumed. Restaurant is nice and staff was friendly. We had no wait for lunch on a Saturday. I'd maybe go back for an entree, but my mind is made up on the sushi."}, {"review_id": "ml4j65dPQrDBv9NHTyYhRg", "user_id": "Yzz2nYNZ8x3yFVrrTAvLhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "I'm not even sure why we haven't tried Akai Hana until now.

I haven't been to Akai Hana in years but I was in the mood for a bento box so I swung by here around 1pm. There was no wait for a table. I ordered the Japan box which came with miso soup and salad. The salad was OK but the soup tasted like dishwater. The box itself was uninspired and mediocre. Tempura veggies were tasty but that was about it. I couldn't bring myself to eat more than one piece of sushi and one of the sashimi. It tasted old and had a mushy consistency. I seem to be on a roll with bad restaurant choices lately!
