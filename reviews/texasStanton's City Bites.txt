Luckily we came at an off time (around 3pm) and there was still a small crowd and I could see parking being an issue during peak times. I ordered the Cowboy Brunch burger with curly fries and added the Cajun seasoning for an extra 50 cents. This half pound monster of a burger was delicious! It's served on Texas toast and topped with fried pickels, over medium egg and sauteed onions. The egg yolk soaked into the toast perfectly to add a rich flavor to the already juicy burger. The fries were perfectly cooked though I wish I had not added the Cajun seasoning. Was a little too salty for me. Would have been just perfect without it. I also got to try the Holy Cow burger. To me this was just more of a traditional bacon cheeseburger but still delicious. The beef Patty was so large it broke in half. The burger is pretty juicy so don't Dilly dally when it comes to eating the burger. We munched on the fries before starting on the burger and I think the delay allowed the bottom bun to get a little on the soggy side even though it was toasted. The only thing I wish they would change is to have tap water available instead of having to purchase bottled water since all their drink selections ate bottled and not fountain. I love this place and can't wait to come back and work my way through their menu."}, {"review_id": "1bRRGi_vah8jlPbTzlq5yA", "user_id": "eb1C6UJdc9a_a7twYMIxyQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "So I am a burger fiend and drive by this place alot on my way to Momentum. Finally came by because I read about them online when other people were asking about burger recommendations. I was pretty impressed by the burgers here, I think I got just their standard cheeseburger which came with some of the best fries Ive ever had. Pricewise its the same as some of the nicer burger places,less expensive than a restaurant but pricier than a fast food place. The inside looks like 50s diner and a shabby chic vibe which suits their menu. Unfortunately I do take issue with the fact that they dont offer complimentary water as a sit down place, your only option is to purchase bottled water. I hate plastic waste so I knocked off a star."}, {"review_id": "yQKmBzO--ZBeSiFQTUj2uQ", "user_id": "zq9rhRo7oXn8XQEse1YUnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Had a Luke Skyburger.

No fountain drinks, bottled drinks only.  I had the spicy chipotle burger and my husband had the cowboy brunch.  The spicy chipotle wasn't spicy at all but I do have a high tolerance for spice.  The burger itself was juicy and a little messy.  My husband wasn't crazy about his cowboy brunch.  We ordered cajun fries which plenty to share with one order.  Overall, the meal was just ok.  I wouldn't order the same thing on my next go around.Service is friendly and fast.  Cleanliness is ok...it's a burger joint so can't expect much."}, {"review_id": "MWSkdXu9-94v6fY0WhbueA", "user_id": "fafQY-OvIFOO0ail09Mvgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Stanton's offer some pretty stellar burgers with some good darn fries. This place gives you an old school vibe, casual and homey. Parking, however, is limited with a few parking spaces on both side of the place. Your next best bet is street parking. Do not park at the lot across so you won't risk your car being towed.We came here at noon before the lunch rush. Services were quick and the food came out soon after. Good thing we ordered without waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. The line was getting longer as the afternoon went by. I ordered the spicy chipotle burger, tator tots, and an orange Fanta. My friends ordered different fries so we could have a tasting party. Out of the four different type of fries which included classic, curly, tator tots, and waffles. My favorite would have to be the waffle fries. Super crunchy and huge portion on all the fries. My spicy chipotle burger could have been more spicy. Burger was juicy and the meat was grilled just right. The bun was hot and veggies were fresh. Quite a meal. I was able to finish most of it. The owner, Theresa was very friendly and accommodating to our big party of 28 people. A few concerns were made because the inside was not known to be big but they did a great job. We occupied about 3 tables that was set up in the middle of the place. Everything went swiftly. My entire party enjoyed their burger and fries. We had a blast here catching up and chatting away. Definitely one of the top places to grab burgers!"}, {"review_id": "AKzhcEYYMQjEbjArNyUZEw", "user_id": "Mbjj_ENbAaMMdFlIBSzjyA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Stopped by here for some burgers on a Thursday lunch outing. First tip- parking is only 4 spots in the front or street parking, so you may find yourself having a short walk or making the block to look for a spot!You order at the front counter and drinks are off to the side in a cooler. While there is ample seating & shared tables, if it's a busy time for them, you may have to pull up to the bar. My friends and I ordered: Sliders & Fries, Two plain hot dogs and a cheeseburger with jalapenos. The food didn't take too long to come out and everything was fresh & hot. The buns are slightly crunchy but the melted cheese and patty was delicious. AND those fries- YUM! The seasoned fries are a must here!We also got a to-go order for our friend and we did have to wait a few minutes for it (we ordered it with our food and asked for a 15 minute delay), but it was made fresh and hot as well!Would recommend this place for anyone looking for a good burger joint!"}, {"review_id": "cETGDNe9CCOo5zPxsv2bLg", "user_id": "QGBDf2VXxlfwK_zruQp0GQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Parking is not that great? I didnt see a sign for a lot or anything. Plenty of street parking though. You walk up to a countrer and order. Pretty simple & throwback to old burger joints, i guess. My wife ordered the classic and i ordered the bacon cheese burger. It took a bit but no complaints really. Maybe 10-15minute tops. So you know, their food is made to order. Both our burgers were great. I only wish that my patty was a little bigger but it had great flavor and right amount of grease to it. Buns were fantastic. Held both our burgers perfectly and crispy on the inside & right amount of fluff on the outside/top. Bacons in my cheeseburger were solid but nothing to rave about. The cashier was super nice and friendly. Plenty of diner style sitting (booth, table). Overall a dope burger joint. Ill be sure to come back and try other items."}, {"review_id": "uaGNdjB1WnIjfGApv83dAQ", "user_id": "t_PxtylOinFb1S0KNHfKbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The food is delicious.

If you're looking for some savory, unhealthy, huge and heavy burgers then Stanton's City Bites is it!

Apparently these are two of four of their most popular burgers and they did not disappoint! We also ordered Chili Cheese Tater Tots ($6), which was so perfectly crispy!

There's no parking lot to park in, so you either have to park on the streets in the neighborhood or you can park in the four parking spots that are right in front of the restaurant (if it's ever available). The restaurant has an \"old diner-ish\" or \"small town\" vibe to it, so it was pretty cool! It made me feel like everyone knew each other lol. There's a wide selection of bottled (non-alcoholic) drinks to choose from on the right side and there's a bunch of couches/chairs (I assume waiting area) for you to sit on the left side.The way this restaurant operates is: you grab your drinks, order your food, find a table (or counter) and they will bring the food to you. Some of the tables are a little wobbly. Also, I would suggest bringing wipes because some customers do not wipe down the tables when they're done eating and I have yet to see any employee come out to wipe down the tables (just for you germaphobes out there!). I would say that a majority of the menu items are $10 or less. I ordered the Luke Skyburger, curly fries and the chicken tenders. Luke Skyburger ($10) - This burger comes with garlic spinach, mushrooms, provolone, and bacon. First off, these burgers are super toasty and huge!! I had to squish it a little so it could fit in my mouth.  It was very greasy too, but that was not too much of a problem since I rarely treat myself to greasy foods! The bacon in this burger is coated in batter and deep-fried. Sometimes the patty falls apart from the burger when you're trying to eat. The style of the burger kind of reminds me of Five Guys.Fries ($3) & Chicken Tenders ($7) - I ordered these for my cousin & daughter because they were not in the mood to try out burgers. These items were mediocre, I don't think you can ever \"mess up\" these items. I wouldn't necessarily make the drive out here to come and eat here, but I would stop by if I'm ever in the area. :)"}, {"review_id": "mJqnYd3-ZshFXirSoBIg9w", "user_id": "IcvEF1jyvAJx-zR6LO2l8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "One of the best burgers.

The burgers have a good taste but honestly, I thought they were a little on the small side.  Granted, we are both cutting back so although the burger was a little small, it was enough.  We split an order of Cajun fries.  They do not sell fountain drinks.  All drinks are sold by the bottle.  They have sodas, water, teas, and beer all in bottles.  I guess that eliminates free refills.  Dining Area:  I love the old school feeling.  The ambiance really reminds me of the way many businesses around Houston looked when I was growing up in the 70's.  It is my understanding that this place originally started out as a corner grocery store with a grill.  However, the grill quickly became more profitable than the store and eventually, the restaurant became the focus of the building.  There are many really old pennants hanging on the walls.  Many of them are from cities around the USA.  However, if you notice, all of the state abbreviations are multiple letters instead of the standard two letters.  For example, one of the pennants says, \"Chicago, ILL.\" and another says, \"San Fransisco, Calif.\"  I'm an old guy so I remember when all of the states had long abbreviations, but most youngsters that use Yelp today have not been alive long enough to know this.  Parking:  There is very limited parking directly in front of the building on Edwards St.  There are also four parallel parking spots on Houston Ave.  The rest of the parking is street parking.  If it is the weekend, you may be able to park across the street at another local business.  However, you may get towed if you do that on a weekday.  I wouldn't risk it Mon-Fri.  Bottom line:  Good burgers but not on my top 10 list.  The ambiance of the building is old school.  Parking is limited.  Take it for what it is worth.  Bon appétit."}, {"review_id": "rVCWHbf8GpdQ5g8GwaWo6Q", "user_id": "TTgpnXR3ni7Z7Qx4LPvqDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Good good good!
