The tea was absolutely wonderful. I loved that they had many local things for sale from other local owned shops. I would have rated this tea shop much higher but the young lady that greeted us was so rude! We asked a few questions and she rolled her eyes and told us \" it's just tea, I don't know what to tell you\" I found it horrible that a place that had many teas for sale couldn't tell me about the flavors. I will most likely be back because I enjoyed the ambience, the tea and the give Local. But the young lady needs to learn to greet people and enjoy her job, she was on her phone while we were ordering."}, {"review_id": "cu2ihCzwkU7oKWMzGm4fzQ", "user_id": "NgEuIIiWDEIGbzaFHi8uhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Had tea here yesterday with some coworkers, and we all agree it's a charming place!

First of all, the ambiance: A tea shop is far more quiet than a coffee shop--no bean grinders or espresso machines. This one has a front area with cafe tables and a back lounge with a couch and love seat, a table for two, a table for six, and various floor cushions. The front area is sometimes a bit noisy with people coming and going, but still quieter than your average coffee shop. The back lounge is sometimes reserved for groups that are meeting here, but when it's open, it's almost like sitting in your own living room (if your living room were always tidy and soothing and tea-scented). The music is usually the light instrumental type, played at a quiet volume; it's not at all obtrusive. The tea: They have a huge variety with something for everyone. Anything can be hot or cold; you can add various herbs or \"boosters\" to anything; you can have it straight up (unsweetened, no cream or milk), with honey or sugar, milk, cream, or almond milk. (Almond milk is the same price as regular milk.) Any tea can also be made into a latte. They have specialty drinks as well. They also have a small coffee menu (they get their coffee from Beansboro) and a few drinks that combine coffee and tea. Food: They carry a small selection of baked goods. Most of their items are vegan and/or gluten free. I think they use a local private baker for most things, but I know they also get the gluten-free bagels from a baker out of state (Virginia, maybe). The selection seems to change from day to day. Everything I have tried has been good. The staff: I saved the best for last. The three ladies I have interacted with here have been so sweet. They show such care and compassion for their customers. So much of their menu is selected for the wellness of their customers. The staff are really knowledgeable about the many varieties of tea they offer, as well as the health benefits that can be achieved. They have given me suggestions on what to try next, answered my endless questions, and been so kind to everyone. They never seem too busy to listen and care. Other features of interest:This is a breastfeeding-friendly establishment, for those who may need or care about that. There are two single-occupant bathrooms for customers. The bathrooms are gender neutral and large enough to handle a wheelchair or stroller, plus several adults, should someone need assistance. Parking is the only shortcoming--on the street, around the corner, or in the lot across the street. I haven't had trouble with it, but this might be an issue for anyone who has trouble walking more than a few steps. They're closed on Mondays. They have free wifi. It works well. Ask the staff for the password. If you're having trouble connecting, try switching web browsers. They have bags of tea, various herbs, local honey, and several other products by local artisans (ceramic pottery, soaps, etc.) for sale. They also sell various tea-making implements."}, {"review_id": "3-owxeZHlej5bvpXOaxaKQ", "user_id": "r8jxPyRm59DAcL24agchGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2017", "text": "happened upon Sarah's shop by accident.

C'est tres chic! I happened to stumble into this place because I was late for yoga. What a beautiful tardiness experience. The tea shop feels you walked into a spot in Italy or France. The sounds from speakers are very soothing sounds of classic French music and bluesy-folksy musicThe best part is the tea. My eyes were set on the lavender rose but, they were out of stock. I settled for the strawberry fields. It was certainly a joy to my taste buds. I will certainly be back here probably be bringing my laptop. At least after my yoga class next time."}, {"review_id": "Wt1BjV37_npbhHd-opsurQ", "user_id": "hsu9lyXiAX5dQD4lLzYyyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2015", "text": "This is a really cool little place.

This cute shop is a block away from my gym and was easy to find since it's a fun lemon-lime color shop in a sea of tan. Walking inside, it smelled like lavender, and later smelled like cookies. Not sure if it's from the blend of teas or some sort of fragrance they have out. Either way it made me smile immensely. There's a few tables and chairs along the walls for relaxing, studying, or whatever you choose. I noticed a sign for a lounge in the back, but did not check it out. Guess it's a bigger space for groups. It's pretty quiet in here, but not eerily. I was greeted by a super friendly and helpful barista. She allowed me to smell various teas and boosters, and helped me decide on which tea I would like to try. You can get your tea made hot, cold, or latte. I went with the Lemon Verbena (hot) and it was soooo good. My mom went with the Sweet Mango, which didn't need much sugar since it was naturally sweet. I did purchase a small bag of Strawberry Fields and that was tasty as well. I cannot wait to come back and try something new."}, {"review_id": "Y_KAhYAIiLeH6vwh6kmiWQ", "user_id": "Ouxrr6W8KcLzr2m8veyuSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "This is the best tea shop in Greensboro!!

PLEASE get the Ginger Matcha Cookie (GF, V) when you come here -best cookie I've ever had, and so full of flavor in every bite. The Chocolate strawberry Pu'erh tea is what I got to drink and I must say it's full of taste and very easy to sip once cooled. Loved it. They have superfood cereal which I picked up for a nice brunch and the wonderful lady at the counter provided me with a creamer bowl of almond milk and spoons. Great hospitality and it really made my first time feel so welcoming and warm.
