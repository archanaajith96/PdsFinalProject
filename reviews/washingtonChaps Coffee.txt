Immediately, I was impressed with the location. With a mountain back set and an inviting entrance, I knew it had to be good. And it did not disappoint!The staff was friendly and efficient, and the food was excellent. The oatmeal is a must! It was unlike any oatmeal I've had in my life. I recommend Chaps!"}, {"review_id": "7HFkVPgzq4ajWJkQuDlL0w", "user_id": "12-5RdgXp8hQF7--P8fGUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Just had breakfast here while visiting my sister at school and really enjoyed it. The theme and style of this place makes it easy to as does the service.We were greeted with a smile and felt warm and welcomed. It's also nice to be able to order them sit and wait for the food to be brought table side. There is plenty of space indoors and an upstairs area as well as seeking outdoors.

It was very busy this morning as it was a beautiful, sunny, Sunday. I was visiting relatives and friends and Chaps was the perfect place! We did have to wait in line for about 20 minutes, so if you have a large party just plan ahead. They have indoor seating as well as outdoor, and serve lunch items as well as breakfast. I tried their blueberry French toast, with cream cheese topping. It is really more like cake for breakfast and it was delicious. They have many workers working their buns off to accommodate for the huge rush. I am only knocking a star off because we had trouble flagging down our waiter for ketchup and hot sauce (they have sriracha) and they would bustle away. I wish they just had the basics on the tables already, maybe ketchup, salt, pepper, etc. Chaps is locally owned and you can tell every detail of the place was well thought out and designed. Family friendly and a great place to catch up!"}, {"review_id": "fxqn3rJjwE0VJzFS0P6JLg", "user_id": "VBG-VBPmxh-xMbrzmzLp-w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "First timers here so this is for folks who've never been here before. The way this restaurant/cafe works is just bizarre. You enter and someone points to menus and says \"grab your menus and order at the counter\". Okay...so we do. We order our breakfasts with coffee and I was given a coffee mug. What was I supposed to do with it? Then the printed receipt came and like other reviewers mentioned, I don't enjoy looking at the tip section when I wasn't even waited on so we put down the standard 20%. What a joke as you'll find out.So we're told to sit by table number 26 near the Chaps sign. \"You'll see it\". Huh? Where? So someone points to the inside of the restaurant so we go looking for table numbers. You don't get seated. We're sitting there waiting for my coffee for about 10 minutes and no coffee, no wait staff. Again, this is weird. I get up and start looking around and find a single coffee carafe and then realized it was self-serve like a gas station. Would have been nice to have been told this when I paid for it. Oh well, at least I got coffee, right? Well, the coffee was awful, IMO. Next came our food. I got the chicken fried steak, he got the cougar gold omelette and we split the buckwheat pancake. The only reason why it's a 2 star and not a 1  Star was because of his omelette which was fantastic. My CFS was just pure horrendous, kinda like eating school cafeteria food. The batter was thick, super fried and hard and the meat was tasteless. There goes my $14.00. As for the buckwheat pancake, how can you mess up pancakes? Well, they did. Pancakes are supposed to be soft and tender. Our's had a thick layer on the bottom so you couldn't cut it with a fork. I had to use a knife to cut it. At no time did a wait staff come over to ask about our meal. You have to get up and grab your own doggie box. So as I said earlier, what's the point of tipping when no one waits on you. Now I know. I will give this place another try one day. The omelette was that good but not much else. At least I know it's not your standard restaurant where they have wait staff so I won't be disappointed in their service."}, {"review_id": "qvwVQGBc00yT-Oxv6SohiA", "user_id": "5bnJLCGaZW-3Y4VHjr1iRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This morning, my wife and I had breakfast here for the first time.  It was very busy, but the staff was attentive on checking with us.  We shared an order of the Blueberry Muffin French Toast; two big slices of blueberry muffin done as French toast with whipped cream cheese and blueberry topping.  The muffin was warm and moist and very delicious with the topping.  There were country potatoes, perfectly cooked and with an excellent seasoning.  Thick cut bacon that was flavorful and cooked just right.  We were very pleased with our breakfast."}, {"review_id": "KuhNFNgpJ9XHiqS6dZCRkg", "user_id": "c8YL8X9Xw6ijFRkn-s337Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "OMG! What can I say that hasn't already been said about Chaps?! This place is amazing! From the eclectic decor to the fabulous food, this is a must try for anyone in the area. First, let me just say that yes, I like oatmeal... it's good but not something I would normally order when going out for breakfast because yeah.... it's oatmeal... but not at Chaps... their oatmeal is something else! I wish I knew how they made this magical deliciousness so badly! I have never had oatmeal that tastes this good. It is the perfect texture with just the right amount of sweetness and well blueberries... yes please!!! And scalded cream, OMG yaaassss!!!!! So ridiculous that fricking oatmeal can taste so good. And their bacon?! Cray good!!!Another must mention - their apple fritters are like nothing you have ever or will ever have again. AMAZEBALLS!!!!!!!!! It's like a cross between a doughnut and a croissant.... ooooohhhhh.... yeeeessss... flakey buttery apple yummmmm!!! You must try these! (I just made myself super hungry thinking about them!) And ok... another honorable mention is the blueberry French toast, it's basically cake. Yummy, delicious cake!!!!Warning on the crazy lines, this place is crazy busy on the weekends but totally worth it!"}, {"review_id": "96LND_svZM7KRI2gTBYMiA", "user_id": "Hx0ankObWpbNtuXz40n16Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Cafe in Eagle Ridge, beautiful rustic/industrial/vintage decor. Nice patio outside but not a lot of shade so for sun-lovers. You can sit in the main area or off to the side with the bar for more privacy. Bathrooms are super cute but a little dark (mood lighting?). Giant parking lot as it is in a plaza with Yoke's so no trouble finding parking.I've had breakfast, sandwiches, salads and lunch stuff, as well as pastries from the kickass bakery (go early for croissants!). Clientele brings in anyone from families to seniors to mid-20s so it's a relaxed vibe. I like to stop in for a coffee/chocolate milk and pastry with my daughter after the park. Sandwiches and salads are pretty good, breakfast is great and huge portions! I thought the mac & cheese was a little oily and spicy for my taste (from the bacon?). I'm a big fan of roasted beets and goat cheese salads, theirs is really tasty.Service is always friendly and prompt - order and pay at the counter first before sitting down at your table (they assign tables as you're waiting in line, menus are located at the central column when you walk in the door). A meal will probably run you $15-20 depending on item and drinks. Nice chill place to hang out at."}, {"review_id": "rX2uY5GVhbu8BshH_JVAxA", "user_id": "81xFyoicAMe5-0TJPz5KDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "Guy Fieri came here for a reason, ok???This restaurant is a great spot for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. People seem to only remember it for weekend brunch, but the food any time of the day is outstanding (and the crowds really dissipate for dinner on the weekdays, which can be really nice). The kitchen is small but works hard. Depending on when you go, that may mean that they are out of certain options. Still, this means everything is made in small batches in a fresh manner, which is great! I'm usually more of a savory breakfast person, but man alive am I a sucker for their baked oatmeal (with blueberries).

The ambiance definitely deserves more stars if it's based on that alone. No wait for us on a Saturday morning. We opted to sit outside but quickly moved inside due to all the bugs. No biggie. I thought the setting is super cute. When you walk in you first get in line to place your order. A waiter chooses a table for you and gives you a number to look for after you had place your order. The lady who took our order was very nice and so was our waiter.The food, on the other hand, was lacking and quite bland. Maybe because I didn't order the right thing? I felt their brunch menu didn't have a lot of options. I ordered the Spanish omelette and it was nothing special. I had to drench it in Tabasco sauce.
