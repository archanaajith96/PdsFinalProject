Environment : I absolutely love the feel in here. It is a more laid-back, chill place. Very clean and has a good coffe house feel. Small tabke mostly seating small groups . There is a bar area in the middle that is a cool touch. What's nice is thay kids are welcomed still.Service: very fast service.  I really like how nice they were. Smiley and personable.  They seemed to like what they were doing.  Product: it's a cool touch to serve both alcohol and coffee in one place. I really like that they have such a large choice of beer.  Adds a great touch.  And the coffe is amazing.  Definitely know what they are doing,  and are doing it very well."}, {"review_id": "AmeSY7Y7MfeJtbBX2Grldw", "user_id": "xCOoicoiJUGOUL1nR1bzPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Stopped into Old Crown for a post dinner beer. I loved the laid back atmosphere! The staff was super friendly and helpful. There was a mix of crowd, some young and old. As soon as you walk in you smell the coffee. They have a long bar rail and a few tables for 2-4 people each. I could definitely see myself posting up here to work or grab a drink with friends. We ordered a couple of beers and were surprised by the options they had available in bottle and draft. They also had quite the list of house cocktails! They also have a pinball area in the back which appeared to be pretty popular. Service and atmosphere are great. I will definitely be returning for coffee and to try something off the food menu!"}, {"review_id": "j7s-00zoCYYCjw6ERnDCZQ", "user_id": "mKZvKgLeXM-8ziw0EX5V1w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "I wanted to like this place more. Maybe I'm too old and not hip anymore (if I ever was). The service was good and they were friendly. It did seem like an odd kind of combination. If you like beer...you're in luck. Many types of beer that filled an entire sheet of paper. Coffee too.:.they have you covered. My husband got a caramel macchiato and we said we were dining in and they gave him a paper cup. They have nice mugs that would've been better to drink out of verses a paper cup. Almond milk was an extra .75 cents. We had each a sandwich. I got a Ruben and he got a rosemary sun-dried tomato ham and Swiss (grilled). They were each under $7. You only get the sandwich, no chips or anything. They were a sandwich, nothing really extraordinary. It's an adult place with few options for children. It is a meet a friend for coffee or drink kind of place."}, {"review_id": "tctjIZNozdM4D6NPX0Hn0g", "user_id": "aR8cccKx8RaI2Y50ggLJEQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Came in for ground coffee to be \"greeted\" by an unfriendly employee.

We came here for dinner and didn't tap into the beers this time, but will definitely be back to partake soon! I love that this place has a revolving, small menu. The menu changes weekly and it only has about 5 things to choose from. To me, this means fresh food and fine tuned recipes. We had some Mediterranean Chicken and it was absolutely delicious. (I'm sorry I don't remember the actual name, but since the menu changes weekly, I doubt you'd see the item to order anyway.) This place is definitely a hidden, hip treasure!UPDATE: We have returned a couple of times and been disappointed. The service/check out is slow as can be. We ordered a bloody mary and screw driver one day and it literally took 30 minutes to get one drink. It's lost points as far as I am concerned."}, {"review_id": "RyuHUvbwMqDI0kq-xxLgkg", "user_id": "PjYs03gEFZvognZTgVuOjQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Best coffee roaster in town.

Also little attention paid to detail, (like pads on the bottom of the chairs so they don't squeal) which makes the place feel a little classless and uncomfortable"}, {"review_id": "fzcqyXZqc2fWr2LSLgKZgw", "user_id": "H2DNqyt2CR5a8Gv3Jisqhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/3/2016", "text": "I like Crown Royal. I actually dated a boy by that name...like real government name... OK, back to the review ;-) Came here because I saw the light \"Crown\" in the window. A true Yelper Elite can't pass something like that when exploring. I was hungry, need a drink and a patio, and Crown fit the bill. First, went inside to a cute coffee shop/bar. It's like a bar and coffee shop had a baby.  The waitress came over and made sure I got food. The kitchen closed in 15 minutes upon my arrival, but the waitress ensured I was fed. I also got an Old Fashion, as I need something to do the job right. The waitress was willing to take my food and drink outside, then left me alone, which I needed. Inside, I saw cute artwork on the walls for sale and the bartender having a class at the bar. Everyone and everything was on chill. Most of the customers knew each other and said goodbye with names. This is what I needed in this moment. A true chill spot. Now outside, enjoying my food and drink, life is bliss. While the place sits off the street, the traffic was not too much. I had the Italian Grinder with the potatoes. Sooooo good. I thought I was not in the mood for a sandwich, but once I had the first bit, I was in love. All the food was fresh - bread, cheese, meats, greens - and you could tell.Sometimes you need to get away to a chill spot and just \"be\". Crown is my new hideout in Da Fort when I'm in town.

I have been going here off and on when I'm in the area for 18 years. They started off across the street in a place 1/4 of the size they are now. There are so many things I adore about this coffee shop. First the staff is so Friendly and knowledgeable. Then they roast their own beans and offer them in bulk to purchase for your home coffee maker. Next they have the clover. If you haven't had a clover coffee please order one the next time you visit. You will not be disappointed. There's the outdoor patio. Which In the summer is so great to sit out on and read the paper or a book and enjoy great coffee with amazing sun. Then they have the indoor seating area which there's a bar rail or tables. They have a small breakfast menu with a lunch and dinner menu with food that is prepared as you order it with local gardens and fresh bread and meats. They serve beer wine and liquor. They make their own craft cocktails that are amazing. They also sell loose leaf teas. Which I also love because I don't always drink coffee and most places just offer packaged teas. They are ok but loose leaf is just tasty. They also sell custom made shirts and mugs and other wares that have their logo printed on it somewhere. If you have not visited old crown then you are missing out. It's a great local shop with tons of friendliness and goodness inside."}, {"review_id": "0n_HPU-jboCvyvnxgWvChQ", "user_id": "K5vA58EvuN87CQbuRBCiaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2015", "text": "Old Crown catches you off guard. Is it a coffee shop or a bar? Well it is both! (YAY!) I greatly enjoy their brews and usually stick to the house brew or whatever brew of the day they have going. Staff is very knowledgeable about the coffee and they offer beans to sell. Looks like they have a stellar selection.As far as the menu goes, I have not ventured out past the wraps. They have a wide variety. I always feel healthy when ordering lunch or a snack here. The wraps do not come with a side- i wish they did- even just a pickle would be awesome! Free wifi and you won't be the only person lap toppin' away for a few hours if that's what you are looking for. I would post up a lot in between classes at IPFW, usually accompanied by a strong coffee and tears from 30 page papers. Okay maybe not visible tears but they were there. Great coffee shop for the student or professor to break away from campus.I have heard Old Crown is a super cool spot for a Sunday Funday. I look forward to experiencing that side of this hot spot in the North Anthony Corridor."}, {"review_id": "xQSBary9PCayMAcnMG_yMA", "user_id": "MotGduLVj6-hMXKtvmBomw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2017", "text": "What a fun place!  The decor and atmosphere is fun and funky.  The sandwiches my boyfriend and I ordered hit the spot.  They were simple, healthy, and delicious!  The almond milk breve was quite tasty and necessary for my drive home.

Traveling coffee that you get at a gas station 4 hours into an 8 hour trip that taste like burnt coffee grounds - but heck there are 174 different kinds of creamer to mask the flavor.2. Decent coffee you grab on your way to work from places like Starbucks and Dunkin that you can drink without a gripe - unless they accidentally added skim milk to your quad shot skinny soy white peppermint mocha with extra whipped cream.3. OMG coffee that makes your taste buds thankful you woke up today. That coffee is 9th degree of darkness. Sweet lord in heaven it's what all the other dark roast coffee wants to be when they grow up. Not only is it deep and dark but it has 0% acid. I love Old Crown because they are the real deal when it comes to coffee. They roast their own beans and know what they are doing. They sell both brewed and whole coffee beans they can grind for you. The coffee selections are varied and sometimes you can find some very unique beans.  All of there coffee beans for purchase have a description that makes sense as well as a small chart showing the roast, acid, and some other thing I can't remember.  Those give you a great idea of how the coffee flavor will be. Old Crown is worth a visit to experience how coffee was intended to be."}, {"review_id": "sWEcxhthYk7xx5c9DcTXEQ", "user_id": "yZ3pKfxCAgpXMaAdgduDlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/27/2015", "text": "Oh yeah!  Score another one for yelp! Came up to Fort Wayne for our daughter graduation. We are having family in from a far. And having a couple of hours to kill decided to check out YELP..  We were needing a place close to the coliseum. My wife and I arrived in town early to check some place out. We selected Old Crown. Tried it for dinner and it was awesome. Food was great had the NY strip YUM YUM! My wife desired the bread pudding, so we had to have it. After 33 years of marriage. What can I say and yes the bread pudding was awesome! It is kind of a hole I the wall, that said the ambiance is unique and quant. The aroma that filled the room when someone poured the coffee beans into a hopper was erotically divine, you have to love coffee to appreciate!
