We've gone there a couple of times and I've enjoyed it. Food is generally palatable and the lunch specials are reasonable. Today, not so good. \"New lunch special\", \"lasagna and a salad, $6.95\".   Ordered that with a glass of tea. Everyone's drinks came, following with the mixed green salad, followed by our entrees. Everyone order pizza lunch special except for me. My mistake. The lasagna looked tasty. Portion was small but for $6.95, who could complain. Cut the corner off with my fork. Put the bite to my lips. Piping hot. Blew on it a bit. Put the first bit in my mouth and began to chew. Hmm, what's that?  An overcooked,hard piece of cheese? No, texture isn't right. Not chewing very well...About the size of a quarter?  I reach into my mouth and try to extract the object discreetly. Covered in sauce and cheese. Hard to tell. I grasp it and start pulling it apart. It just kept growing. Ends up being a piece of plastic about two inches by nine inches.  Not a huge deal but could of been a choking hazard and I lost my appetite pretty quick. Took a while to get the waitress's attention but when I did she took it away and offered to bring something else. Just not hungry. When the checks came she had comped my meal. The real deal breaker for me. No visit from a manager. No visit from an owner. Just don't get the lack of concern."}, {"review_id": "oVmeL7piXvKlBmo3dSR9Ig", "user_id": "gOCNhdKTFwUw1xwRQPbDpQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "When it comes to pizza I don't play around.  Moving here from Italy, I have become a pizza snob.  Now before coming here I wasn't expecting the pizza to taste like I was back in Italy.  I was though expecting some decent pizza with all the five star reviews.When my friend and I came in, there was only one family there. Half the tables were dirty yet you have a bunch of staff members just standing around.  We decided to order the spaghetti with meat sauce and the pepperoni pizza.  The focaccia bread that came with the pasta was hard and burnt.  The pasta tasted like those frozen meals you get at the grocery store.  The pizza was disappointing.  Shoot, papa johns has better tasting pizza."}, {"review_id": "D6D3Twy86wwtvVhuhSFh4Q", "user_id": "N4etMeP_llZNYMsmUYtFjg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Great ambiance, good foodWe really enjoyed our visit to Tony's. The atmosphere is great, located in downtown Gulfport, very nice area. We ordered the mozzarella squares which were very tasty, also the roasted garlic platter which was delicious.For entrees we had the clam pasta and the blackened shrimp alfredo  both were excellent, also ordered two pizzas, the meat combo and the bianca chicken pizza.. pizzas were very good the crust was perfect and delicious.. everything we ordered was hot and fresh, better than expected service was above average for a crowded Sunday late lunch..

Very cool vibe in downtown Gulfport. If you're visiting the coast with a group of all ages it would actually be a nice compromise spot as I think the Italian dishes on the menu,  the pizzas and sandwiches would pretty much cover everyone in your groupI've had the pizza and it's average,  not bad but definitely not something you would remember.  Last trip I had the  spaghetti with meatballs. The spaghetti sauce really didn't  have a lot of flavor and unfortunately the meatballs were on the cold side.On my last visit , the server was actually part of the issue.  She had a really weird attitude, somewhere between in different and smart as*. I could really do without attitude when I'm over paying for average food so I think the owners need to really make sure that their wait staff are adding a positive note to the overall experience. A upbeat server with a great attitude can really sway someone's feeling about their dining experience."}, {"review_id": "Edsh9N0qwJVFSO9C39WLMg", "user_id": "BUGLF91qoq5mrUGqb4ZTeQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "This was my first time back in a while, so I was very excited - unfortunately I was most disappointed with the lunch I had there today! Let me just say, I've had some wonderful things there, including their full pizzas and some incredible pasta dishes, also the fried mozzarella appetizer, roasted garlic and bread. But my lunch was most disappointing - the two pieces of pizza were really small and you could tell had been sitting for a little while at least. They were very different from their regular pizzas in size and I also believe in quality. The salad was the only thing about the lunch I enjoyed, so I was thankful for that."}, {"review_id": "h7LcRzSqOJvHUw3sHqZe4w", "user_id": "OcZrbXXvTnvhKShw0Nlpmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "I tried the fried mozzarella squares and a cheese pizza.

I've only had sweet tasting pizza one other time. I'm not a fan, but it was still good pizza nonetheless. Topped it all off with the house wine.

The ambiance and decor of the restaurant was really nice however the pizza was very very subpar. We ordered three 12inch pies (the only size available). While the waitress was friendly, we waited over an hour to get our pizzas despite bieng one of three tables in the restaurant. My Mediterranean pizza was slightly burnt and my dads pizza was incredibly soggy on the bottom crust almost as if it had been put in a plate of water before being served. His pizza also had no sauce on it what so ever even though we asked for it and were charged an extra $2.25.

It was extremely packed the day we came and we had very reasonable wait times. We ordered bread with marinara, which for some reason tasted like tomato soup, but it was delicious anyway! At least it's the best tomato-soup-tasting-marinara I've ever had lol. We had the chicken and alfredo sauce and a pepperoni pizza, AMAZING!!One thing that for me determines whether or not I will frequent a pizzeria is if their pizzas taste good reheated. We heated it in the oven and it was still very flavorful! (Big reason we get two pizzas is to save them for lazy days... we've had many bad reheating experiences hehehe).Anyway, would recommend!

Got to the restaurant 25 minutes later and still had to wait for my food, overall it took 40 minutes to get my food. I was given my bill, which by the way was not handed to me, but slammed on the table while the server was on the phone; I noticed that the prices online differ from what I was charged and when I inquired about it, I was told that the prices online were wrong and need to be revised. I can understand prices increasing, but if someone orders from your website, you should honor those prices. To top it all off there were items left off my order that I had to go back and get. I really felt as if I were a bother to the server and that my business was not appreciated.

They use shells but the ingredients and wood fired (?) oven make it all work out. The service is a toss up. Sometimes it's very good - and at other times it's very bad.

If we're hungry and don't know what we want, we're always happy that we decided on Tony's. It's safe to say we go once a week and we've been coming regularly since 2013. I don't understand the reviews who complain about a wait or rude servers. We're always in and out within 45 minutes and we've never had a bad experience. It does get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights but they share space with Sea Grapes so out of all the times we've been here, we've only had to wait for a table once. We get the same thing every time (although we have tried the lasagna, it's fab.) The fried mozzarella is TO DIE FOR. It's not your average, chewy mozzarella stick that you get at a chain restaurant. It's a square of gooey mozzarella breaded in panko and it tastes like heaven. I highly recommend dipping it in ranch! They make their own dressings in house and this is the best ranch dressing I have ever had. SO GOOD! The italian parmesan is also really good on their salads. For our actual meal, we get the \"perfect pepperoni\" and let me just say, they gave it an accurate name. It is the perfect pepperoni pizza. It is only available in one size, 12\", but this is always enough between the two of us,  2.5 when our toddler joins us. They also give him a little ball of dough to play with in the beginning while we wait! If you're looking for a good, inexpensive dinner in a charming setting, this is your place!"}, {"review_id": "XXfrLH4KQ81v0r-5VRZjUA", "user_id": "qtwhTCGZ7RhxE4alpXi4cQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "This place was great and I would highly recommend this establishment to everyone.  My wife and I enjoyed our meal and would highly recommend it."}, {"review_id": "Y0mRFTH7Qr5IgEbtz9bzhQ", "user_id": "uiA9XHgXfo3K-r86wLGAKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/4/2017", "text": "Loved the pizza subs and spaghetti.
