Occasionally you'll stumble upon one serving transcendent fried seafood, and sometimes you'll find one that's horrible. Tommy's is \"middle-of-the-road.\" I like that Tommy's will prepare you some of the cheapest seafood in town, as well they should for the no-frills experience you'll find here.Tommy's Lobster Roll features a genuinely good mildly-flavored lobster salad, and can be ordered \"half-size,\" which is still a substantial amount of lobster stuffed into a buttered and toasted top-split hot dog roll. The whole-bellied Fried Clams I would also recommend - they are best obviously straight out of the fryer, their golden craggy surfaces still glistening with oil, with the contrasting textures of crunchy batter, taut abductor muscles, and of course the scorching hot liquefied bellies that explode in your mouth and coat your tongue with pure ocean - these are as good as you'll have in New England at this type of establishment.I wish I could also sing the praise of the Clam Chowder, which I disliked on account of it being made with what I presume to be chicken broth. I am okay with such culinary tricks when they're pulled off in a way that elevates the dish, but this really did just taste like regular clam chowder but with chicken stock instead of the natural clam juices, which is all that's really needed. Also, I'm not sure I enjoyed the Clam Cakes (typically a favorite of mine at these types of places), which were browned to the point of almost being burnt and tough to bite into. I also disliked that they did not serve beverages at the order window, and only at a cash-only soda machine which means that even though they accept credit cards, you'll need to bring cash if you want a beverage. The final quibble I had with my visit here is that the order counter experience was not good: I literally waited like 3-4 minutes in front of a young lady who was sorting quarters and other change or whatever in the cash register before she took my order. I understand that this is a mom and pop restaurant that specializes in cheap seafood and not award-winning service, but c'mon man. Overall, I'd eat here again for the fried clams and the lobster roll if I were in the immediate area, but this is not an experience worth driving to.Food-Décor-Service: 3.0/2.0/NA"}, {"review_id": "1B7gLylHPt4eSclM6T9idA", "user_id": "Jk4Hh__zBkhT7xUbWXUpGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/7/2017", "text": "Best seafood shack ever. Reasonable prices, friendly staff. For a whole lobster, a lobster roll, a combo pint of clam chowder + crab cakes, we only spent $40. This is unheard of in the Cape. Their special for the day was $10 steamed lobsters. WHAT? That's cheaper than buying it live at your local super.  Rec: (++++) white clam chowder. This is the best New England chowder we've had. It's rich in chunky potatoes and is creamy thick in consistency. It may not be teeming with clams, but their flavor is amazing. Don't order a cup, order a pint. It's THAT GOOD. Their chowder in all honesty was the highlight of our trip here. (+++) lobster roll. They custom order their buns so it's larger than your typical hot dog bun. Plenty of lobster to chow on. None of that stingy business.(+++) steamed lobster orders will include a corn on the cob and a condiment cup of liquid butter. I personally don't like clam cakes but theirs is made to order so it's piping hot. Everything is packed in a to-go fashion. There are plenty of picnic tables up front to dine in. It's a help yourself kind of service. Restroom is 1 port-a-potty.

I am kind of new to New England and I didn't fully understand why people get so excited about clam shacks. I usually found them too busy and too expensive, for small portions of okay food.We actually went here after driving by Iggy's and not even slowing down, because the line was a block long. We got to Tommy's and there was a line, but a very short wait. As for the food, my better half and I shared clam cakes, a lobster roll, clam strips and I had a cup of chowda (white if that matters to you). The clam cakes we're great!! Maybe my favorite so far. The clam strips were nice, meaty and flavorful. The lobsta roll was nice, I personally like the warm ones, but not a lot of places around here seem to do it. The chowda was pretty good, it was not packed with clams the way I like it, but still tasty."}, {"review_id": "58mMtpS5tMQAF9h-vslbDQ", "user_id": "EEnWl-gRn0dEkeIbX2bF6Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Probably verify that they are open before you go so you don't waste your time.

Nothing compares to the seafood shacks that MA and RI have to offer. I am pleasantly happy that Iggy's line was extremely long and I traveled down the road to Tommy's to give them a try. Being close to Iggy's, a staple in RI, I recommend switching it up and giving the Clam Shack a taste. You won't be disappointed!The line was not too long, but the staff moved quickly to ensure prompt service. I ordered the clam strip dinner and my partner ordered the dried shrimp. The wait was only about 5 minutes and the owner (and or manager) offered clam cakes to try out while we all were waiting. This alone was a selling point to me to come back. The clam cakes were unbelievable. It was so fresh to taste actual pieces of clam in the cakes. The portions for both dinners were aligned with pricing. The fries were decent, although a little soft for my liking. A few more minutes of the frier would have made them delicious. The clam strips were tender, not overly juicy and full flavored. Not one of them was rubbery or tough to chew. Again, so refreshing! Seating is fully outside on good ol' fashioned picnic benches. The benches do have umbrellas, but it may not be quite as enjoyable if there is rain. But no fear! All items come ready to go in takeout boxes.My only issue with Tommy's is that sodas and waters only come from a vending machine. Luckily the Shack accepts credit cards, but the vending machines do not. We had to go without drinks due to us not having cash on hand. If the vending machines had credit card machines, I'd give it a five!"}, {"review_id": "IH6BLsG8mv7X5Z20SSHHrw", "user_id": "j26AcWn4iKXDkUwOqYip1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/30/2017", "text": "Delicious.

They have everything you are looking for to get your summer seafood fix on: Fish & Chips, Lobsters anyway you want them, raw bar, stuffies, and of course chowder and clam cakes. All of these are prepared fresh and served quickly. They claim they have one of the largest servings of fish and chips in he state and I think I have to agree since it is huge and delicious. If you are looking to mix up your seafood intake the fried oyster tacos are an excellent way to change it up. They are quick and their prices are reasonable.

It was huge!!  It had a very generous amount of lobster in it and it wasn't drowning in mayonnaise. My fish and chips was huge as well.  Jay said Tommy's was known to have the biggest fish & chips around.  He wasn't lying.  Two large pieces of flaky white fish in a light crispy batter. Yummy.  Tons of fries (frozen) a small amount of slaw and tartar sauce.  First thing I did was check the bottom of the box for grease, there was NONE!! Very impressed!  No way I could eat the whole thing. Clam cakes were nicely browned And crispy on the outside and tender with a good amount of clams on the inside. The only disappointment were the fries.  I don't like frozen fries so I only ate a few.  If they started making home made fries, I would up them to 5 stars.  Prices may seem a little high, $10 for fish & chips $16 for lobster roll but once you see the size of the portions, you won't complain.  I definitely recommend Tommys for your seafood fix.  Personally, I think they were better than Iggy's!!"}, {"review_id": "_I9eB9DcZ-VffpMIH2kYew", "user_id": "kiAOv6MqbMY37FIIm-0VjQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/29/2017", "text": "Landed at Providence Airport, and immediately went here.  The food was tasty, made fresh to order.  Fish n chips were huge portion.  The lobster roll was very nice.

Even in a to-go container, there was also an ample amount of ice to keep them fresh.  The best deal of the day had to be the clam chowder, \"half\" a lobster roll (haha, yah right....it was massive!) and clam cakes all for less than $15.In the end, we had an ultimate smorgasbord of the entire sea for less than $50, this came to only about $16/person in our group.  You too, should go wild and sample all of the different offerings at Tommy's.  Sure, the clam cakes aren't Iggy's and I don't think they try to be so the comparison is moot.  I skipped the fries because of other reviewers and went with the fresh corn on the cob instead.  Getting this in the middle of the summer was another highlight of our meal.  An added bonus for hiring a DJ in the parking lot to keep the atmosphere festive.  We also loved his Lassie dog who walked around begging for scraps."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tommys-clam-shack-warwick-7?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
