Parking was available, and I was seated by the friendly hostess right away. The restaurant is clean and did not have a smell typical of an Asian restaurant. :)Shortly thereafter, the sweetest and kindest server took my orders. She also was very knowledgeable of the food.I opted for the lunch specials: sweet and sour chicken with fried rice, spring rolls, and egg drop soup; 2 sushi roll combo, salmon roll and shrimp tempura roll, hot and sour soup, and salad with sesame dressing.So impressed how everything turned out despite small servings. Soups were both hot and flavorful, salad was fresh accompanied by a savory dressing. Sushi rolls were also fresh. Protein to rice ratio was great, rice cooked al dente. On the Chinese food side, I can't say it's authentic but I love all the flavors! It's distinct because it is NOT drenched in so much oil and NOT highly seasoned with MSG. Spring rolls were light and crisp with a great apricot sauce. Chicken had a crisp batter and awesome sweet and sour sauce. Fried rice was equally good! I didn't finish my meals, since the soup, salad and wontons filled me up quick but I AM HIGHLY SATISFIED of Cheng's! Bill came out to $18ish plus tip. Plus points for being kind to me and my 6 month old baby!"}, {"review_id": "EVP9-RB8i10jqOeJdspxCg", "user_id": "9dhGePWNyepzSg4_Z7GzGA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "I ordered 3 simple things that wow-ed me. I did not expect much from 3 appetizers but two days later, here we are thinking about them still.The chicken wings- Chengs garden go above and beyond to season and fry their wings. Such juicy meat and the added chopped grilled onions, peppers and seasoning is nothing like I've ever seen before on wings from a Chinese restaurant. I loved it!The pan fried dumplings- you know how some dumplings have space between the meat and the outside? There was none of that here. It was packed away like small pillows of tasty goodness. They hand make these, bravo! The dumpling sauce I got it with was also amazing. It was not just soy sauce like other places do it.The hot and sour soup- so good, warm and flavorful. It was the first time I got meat in my hot n sour soup. I loved the surprise!"}, {"review_id": "0CqfnxJ-HtbIXHfbukMaYg", "user_id": "9LFPpMAL_x11t_6cZVL7sQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Two words:  CRISPY BEEF!  As you can tell by the pictures, I'm a fan of it.  I'm sure the rest of the fare is terrific, but no matter how determined I am to try something new, I can't turn away from the crispy beef.  Perhaps if you try it, you'll have the same issue."}, {"review_id": "Pj4hUvYepD9cMRkNpjXGBA", "user_id": "fkE8bjLL-fxYj-1_rlq28w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Absolutely the finest oriental cuisine I think I've ever had.

Service still top notch and location still nicely decorated and super clean.The sushi menu has expanded greatly and has some appetizing choices coupled with pictures. Plus side, unlike most, the rolls I was given came very close to matching the menu picture, consistency kudos.Presentation as noted above was very nice and the taste matched. I ordered two rolls, Cheng's Garden and Baked Crawfish roll. Both fresh, flavorful and appropriately portioned per price, with price being pushing the higher side per special roll (12-15$ each)Can't wait to start digging into the rest of the menu!"}, {"review_id": "NVYBwdGafKfNHzJuoPf3-A", "user_id": "2hk-QXhY6DGj1p41I1HmfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Delicious foood I recommend the cowboy rolls without the eel sauce n fish eggs unless you like those toppings.

The fried rice and white rice were good. I wish the bowls were bigger or that you could get one rice refill for free. I always run out of rice before I run out of meat. The portions at lunch was big. The service was very slow. My order was given to a coworker and her order was given to me. We had a private room. We had to ask to order. We had to ask for the checks. We were on lunch break and their service caused us to be very very late getting back to work. Our water was not constantly refilled. Not a great experience this trip."}, {"review_id": "hU7klIwsme60CgEAGM8Ggw", "user_id": "eT_0wlIooQ1DMjBCS2nkTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Awesome lunch deals, I almost always go for the General Tso's chicken.  Their sushi is well portioned and tasty too.  Service is always great and the place just feels clean and fresh to me."}, {"review_id": "rLqpQA73Ykw8bEnXWpdLgQ", "user_id": "evhpA7xEoJ4H1dG8p-3mOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/5/2017", "text": "First time eating here.

I called and ordered on on the phone sweet and sour pork and some rice with chicken and beef in it. It was delicious I also got some fried rice and some sweet and sour sauce with it and all of it was to die for. I got the food probably in about half an hour and was done with it 10 minutes afterwards. I will most definitely keep calling back and ordering from this place in the future.

We ordered combination chow fun combination, the chicken with mixed vegetables, one small egg drop soup, one egg roll, and two small fried sweet, one ice tea, and one hot tea. The ice tea and hot tea did not taste good (cost almost $5 for those drinks). Price include tax $34. and charge 18% tip, so totaled $40. This restaurant is for people that is eating luxury only. This is to give you a heads up. For best advice, you go to other Chinese buffet, the price will be lower and you don't need to pay for tip."}, {"review_id": "oxJtvPFdT8RNzFsEKR8jNA", "user_id": "GE61LK-OXwRpqB8fHMSj8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/9/2016", "text": "This is a really good Japanese restaurant.
