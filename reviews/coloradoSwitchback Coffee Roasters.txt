Great atmosphere, super staff and amazing coffee. Flavorful, quality espresso... smooth and nutty, not bitter. We loved the atmosphere! The food looked great, we had an almond danish that was super flakey and good. Lunch looked good, we just had brunch so we didn't order any but we will next time, for sure!Just down the road from the USA Olympic Training Center, well with the stop!"}, {"review_id": "BU4YMqyigUAp2aLKbnJL3Q", "user_id": "_tmfQAmKDiMFsgAdg8ZIAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "I visited two times within the last thirty days. Round one I went in on a whim and took note of the establishment as being at capacity, so I ordered the house roast pour over, I was in and out within 10 minutes. I breezed over the menu and would have ordered however decided that I didn't want my meal to go so I could truly enjoy the dining experience, hence why I made a second visit... Round two I brought my husband and son and we found a seat. I went up and placed an order for a mocha latte and a brown sugar carmelized latte (the latter latte based on the cashiers suggestion for a caramel machiatto equivalent) we also ordered the breakfast sandwich which conaisited of a split bagel with fried egg, sweet green chili and Canadian bacon. Finally we ordered the waffles(pictured) The cashier handed us our table number and we sat for about ten minutes when our cashier brought us our lattes. The lattes were warm -closer to lukewarm than scalding hot, and of course my husband verbalize what my first thoughts were  \"it's not even hot at all\". I agreed however was interested in tasting without having to scald myself so I personally didn't mind. The mocha I will say was not my favorite as  I picked up keynotes of cocoa baking powder and not a whole lot of coffee/espresso flavor. The froth was delicious so overall I wasn't impressed and at the same time I wasn't disappointed either. The kitchen staff brought out our food items and I thought the waffle presentation was lovely! My son thought so too and I began cutting into it. Meanwhile, my husband had gone through three quarters of the breakfast sandwich devoured it he left me a bite and I had to admit it was tasty. I didn't even get to snap a picture. The waffle wasn't bad and I will add that taste wasn't kid approved as much as it was mom approved. Bottom line I'll be back for that breakfast sandwich."}, {"review_id": "U0KhmM5dNxf8ZrPoWx8NAA", "user_id": "nxI8n6lARJpMP5SI8U9S6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Switchback gets all the points for a cute, trendy, neighborhood coffee shop. Just ask all the dogs you'll find with their owners enjoying the large patio on a weekend morning. My coffee was delicious. My complaint is with the tiny helping of granola with coconut milk for $6. I laughed when I saw it. Don't get me wrong it was really tasty, I just needed another bowl to fill me up for breakfast."}, {"review_id": "IFrAX2QtwfRkigrTSkoWkg", "user_id": "T-ReBn1wTQlE4-UCg6geMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Spectacular display of amazing coffee, fantastic service, and a stereotypical Colorado vibe (in the best way). The Avocado toast was elaborate and delicious. Usually I wouldn't spend the hefty price associated with the hip fruit on toast item, but this version was worth it. Delicious pour over options for the coffee critics and well made lattes for the casual drinker. Great first impression of CO Springs coffee scene. Thanks Switchback"}, {"review_id": "wXMqeSvC9GOgt2IEJT4bww", "user_id": "ELim4aJWSnS3TEUQejwiJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Switchback is a great place to get your morning coffee! It definitely has the local neighborhood vibe. Great place to have coffee with friends or get some work done. I have not had the break fast yet but it looks delicious.

They take customer service to a whole new level!! This is a safe space for anyone and a great place to meet up and chat over great coffee! I am gluten free and it feels nice to have options on what to eat! They have fabulous gluten free waffles and they also accommodate vegan meals as well! I am here at least once every weekend to grab a breakfast sandwich on a gluten free muffin and some waffles! The staff is so knowledgeable with coffee and are willing to answer questions! This place is a coffee shop for those coffee fanatics that strive to make the coffee the best they can! This can be a great place to take your computer and do work, however there are limited outlets for electronics. (It's nice because it encourages more face to face interactions!)

The coffeeshop itself was also filled with bright natural light and had the cutest accents.

It's my morning coffee place on the way to work and some days they've got my cup ready before I walk in the door! I can't speak to the espresso machine drinks but people seem to like them. I prefer the pour-overs personally. The food menu has had a major overhaul and I think it's better than before but I do miss the basic avocado toast with sirracha honey. The new version of it is pretty dang good though!With spring here the patio is a great place to hangout. They should be having their artist/craft patio events soon so make sure you visit on those days too. Keep it up guys!"}, {"review_id": "RlxiZtwZbnHEdHJfpmE6WQ", "user_id": "x0eJYXrhMWGMPD3DbuFTyg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Actually my favorite place in the area.

We were brought water to our seat but the drinks were at the bar waiting and we didn't realize. Despite this the coffee was great; espresso has a nice citrus flavor and their iced lattes were light and sweet.There is a lot of nice seating here and aesthetic plants and tables as well as spots outdoors.

They really are not into cool coffee places so I had to go find one on my own. I am so happy I came across Switchback. Immediately I knew it was for me. The people, neighborhood and staff all just exuded hip! The place was very clean and had a nice layout. You could see all around people just enjoying each other's company. I ordered a ice coffee and cinnamon role. The cashier was very helpful and friendly. The cost was very reasonable. I sat down at a table and opened my paper. A short time later, my coffee and cinnamon roll were delivered to me at my table. All around a very good place to enjoy your morning paper!"}, {"review_id": "vJiexz-WaZ1YT3stc3k_kA", "user_id": "kxbJiup0nnEO70-1kWVANg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2017", "text": "I love the location, the staff, and the decor.

Upon entering its doors, you feel like you've just discovered the quintessential neighborhood coffee house. The decor is cozy. The staff is smiling. The lighting is warm and welcoming. You think to yourself, this could be it. This will be your new java joint. Thats what i hoped for when I ordered a chai latte. Unfortunately, the latte missed the mark. The spices were off-balanced, creating a poignant after taste. My wife usually steals my drink, but this time she let me finish it all on my lonesome. I would've gladly shared. I would still recommend Switchback as a place to hole up and finish that term paper or work presentation; however, I don't see myself stopping in for that regular caffeine fix I so crave."}, {"review_id": "G2k6RrztILWXUHSt_Gn8hA", "user_id": "TgsCpp5qzJ7_y4enHCvMlA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "Best matcha latte and avocado toast.
