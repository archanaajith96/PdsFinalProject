He and his wife had wanted to go here based upon the Yelp reviews. We arrived early, around 11:30, and had our choice of tables. The maitre d' greeted us with a big smile as did our server. My friend ordered the ribs with a balsamic glaze and I ordered a half dozen assorted oysters. Both were delicious. We both ordered a Stromboli which were also delicious. The bottom line is that I recommend Angelos Taverna!"}, {"review_id": "s5VvOn0UYcE7AVfIDnhoCQ", "user_id": "WbTdWnZSYLKnWf8Ejhyq9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Everything I've ordered on the menu is great, the Oysters are on point (especially during happy hour when you can get a dozen at a reasonable price).  Plus, the wait staff ain't so bad to look at.  Excellent Italian food and great service make this the spot to go in the neighborhood."}, {"review_id": "iZwoBka5JfJFBsdjo6Ssxw", "user_id": "hcRr2TfSwmlLNc8ucPnz8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "This place is super delicious! I am a fan of their homemade pastas. I opted for their homemade linguini instead of the penne pasta. And I'm totally loving it! The homemade pasta just tastes lighter. The alfredo sauce was good too and not heavy like other places I've had. Flavor was definitely on par. Before my dinner here, I also ordered the grilled lamb lollipops. I don't eat lamb much, but I have to give it up and say that this was a quite tasty appetizer. Definitely recommend both!I took a picture of my leftover, because I forgot to take a picture of it! Sorry, I'm learning to do better to start taking photos of my dishes before diving into it!!! That's how much of a foodie I am.....hehe"}, {"review_id": "aK-fH6pNdFZJjk7mYp0Vpw", "user_id": "9qbdQK_99MqV19-crRWBKw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Angelos is an excellent Italian eatery, upscale pub ambiance at $$. We did not do dinner, rather opted for cocktails at the bar and appetizers. They serve martinis in traditional martini glasses bucking the disturbing trend of serving martinis in pudding glasses To our great delight we did fried oyster and crab cake sliders, a grilled artichoke and a bruschetta. It's mostly a younger crowd, although there were a sprinkling of seniors and pre seniors in a standing room only crowd. The staff is friendly, professional and attentive. We have some other fish to fry but Angelos is definitely a keeper."}, {"review_id": "CtF_akMe_Flk3_mjwhVQTA", "user_id": "CXnz4OUqovDx-9GEUrSgBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "This place is absolutely sexy. After I sat down at our table in the back room I was vibing to the R&B and Hip-hop playing in the background. Our server, an absolutely gorgeous woman, was super kind and prompt. Lamb chops were to die for. I was eating those bones clean. I liked the kale that came along with the pieces. For my entree, I got the gorgonzola steak fettuccine. At first bite, I was digging the creamy flavors. But towards the end I started feeling regrets. I should have ordered a half-portion or requested to not include the steak bits. The core,  however - the sauce and noodles - was delicious. I think this place makes a great date night. Cool spot."}, {"review_id": "507VqadDpH75z4qNW8ObgA", "user_id": "W7ZAXkcltdBIntHEXeemMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "If you like Italian food, make a wise decision and eat at Angelos Taverna! My wife and I have been here 3 times and eat time is better than the last. The staff is always helpful, knowledgeable and full of great suggestions. Based on their initial recommendation of the relleno ravioli, I've ordered it every time and I'm always impressed. I wouldn't even say I'm a ravioli guy, but the sauce makes this a dish that I'm not willing to part with!If by some miracle you have room for dessert, get the chocolate ravioli!"}, {"review_id": "fX40niRC6utMVWgp-qhJbg", "user_id": "DtNxQ4hb4uqdvkCFRy64Sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Ohhhh, this place is good.

I had no idea what was waiting for me across the street! We were able to call ahead on a Friday night which was great because it was chilly outside and the waiting area is cramped and small. I tried to get a drink at the bar why we waited, but it was so crowded, after five minutes, I gave up. I was surprised to see how large the restaurant was! We walked through an outdoor courtyard to a private dining area, with several tables, a bar, and televisions. The atmosphere was lively but calm enough to talk.  The red house tap wine was pretty damn good, flavorable and paired great with the Italian fare.  We went with a Pizza, mussels(wow) a salad and risotto balls for an app. The service at the table was excellent. The food was absolutely worth a revisit and the wine list will 100 percent bring me back!"}, {"review_id": "say_LFVCMmdKvaQ3W46USA", "user_id": "l_BLJ_dhXtJJKzQL0yndCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I love Angelos happy hour menu! I l enjoy bringing family and friends here to eat the $1.00 oyster! The sauce that comes with the oyster are so addicting. The sliders and pizza are also great and a good value.

I could end my review there. I grew up making spinach manicotti from scratch with a family friend from a small town in Italy and I haven't had one as good as his until Angelo's! I always order extra sauce on the side because I really enjoy sauce but the dish itself is already great. I don't usually like going out for pasta because I can make a few killer Italian dishes at home but I can't come close with the manicotti. I also can't prepare oysters at home the way Angelo's does. Their happy hour prices are 100% worth it- go crazy on the oysters, the original is my personal favorite. If you like to bike around town there are also several bike racks right out front."}, {"review_id": "TU8UrbD0mEuF0JLbKOsbsw", "user_id": "hQjN1FuYaB4pQACZwfrclw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/7/2017", "text": "Oh gosh, why oh why don't I live in Denver?! This has inspired me to find an equally awesome place in my city of Brotherly LoveFirst off -- this place has awesome regular happy hour deals, and also from 9pm til close -- who could say no to that? $1 oysters, $2 chargrilled oysters, $4 crabcake sliders and $5 toasted ravioli , $1 off draft beer and $2 off TAP wines $3 well drinks.. who could complain? This is also not one of those places that skimp on their happy hour deals, not on quality nor quantity. The toasted ravioli was so delicious, nicely toasted that it almost tasted like mozzarella sticks! The oysters were great, both raw and grilled 0 complaints there. The crab cake was worth $4, it was a good standard crabcake and if I wanted better quality, I'd pay more than $4 for a crab cake. My lobster gnocchi was soooo good, the sauce was amazingly creamy and rich and the gnocchi was made in house, it had more bite/ chewiness to it than most I've had, but not in a bad way! It was chewy, YET soft as well, very very good and highly recommended  -- also reasonably priced at $17!If I lived in Denver... I'd be a regular, and possibly 50 pounds heavier. HIGHLY recommended if you like Italian!"}, {"review_id": "CeraAjg-lEKTILYTN5yfVA", "user_id": "8X1yYVqGXuhHW65oEVwBsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/25/2017", "text": "We enjoyed a wonderful lunch here today. The oysters were the highlight. Excellent lunch special:  $13 for 1/2 sandwich, salad and 6 raw oysters. We also tried a few cocktails and Micheladas. All were fresh and perfect with the oysters.

He also promptly removed our plates and glasses as needed and then disappeared quickly as to not interrupt our conversation.... a rare talent these days.

Well drinks are only $3. On top of it, they serve up house made limoncello. I didn't particularly care for the limoncello as I found it was cloyingly sweet, but I very much appreciated that they at least made it. We went to Odyssey across the street (absolutely our favorite Italian restaurant) and they've stopped serving house made limoncello, so it's a nice surprise Angelo's still does! Our bartender (short, somewhat curly/wavy blonde hair?) was so attentive we came right in the very next day. Thanks for a pleasant experience Angelo's!

I went at Happy Hour (9pm-close) and ordered 1 1/2 dozen of the oysters on the half shell, which were from Maryland that day and $1/each. I also ordered 2 original grilled oysters and 2 honey sriracha oysters (daily special) for $2/each on Happy Hour! SOOOO delish.For my entree, I had the pappardelle Bolognese. It was decent!I'm giving 4 stars, because of the weird ambiance. It's a mix between a bar (loud music, top 40) and a nice restaurant. The dining area seating is too close to the bar ambiance.I was speaking louder than I would at a restaurant, and the booth behind me had typical loud bar girls. Weird dynamic. Not hating, but it kind of took away from the dinner.

We came here for happy hour, in which the oysters are $1, a bowl of mussels soaked in garlic and white wine was $5, and the wines were $2 off. However, there wasn't really reason to stay for the entrees, as the rest of the happy hour menu, like the pizzas, aren't that good and are small in portions.
