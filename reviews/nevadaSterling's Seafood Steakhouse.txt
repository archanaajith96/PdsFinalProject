This place is awesome! I went here the other day with my girlfriend, and we had $200 in casino comps and figured \"why the fuck not\". I checked out the menu online and my eyes widened. $49 for a rib eye steak! Damn! it better be good! Put on a polo shirt, and arrived. Everyone was sooo polite and we noticed some dude at a table with friends in a baseball cap and t shirt, and they were having a blast, so its not so hoity toity. The waiter was amazing, and we picked our food. My girlfriend went with lamb chops, and she added some bourbon panchetta cream corn. OMG! It was more of stew, and it was probably my favorite part of the meal. I went with rib eye, baked potato and salad. Honestly, the steak was meh, it was a rib eye dont get me wrong, it was great but not worth $49. Ive had better Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steaks to be honest. Salad was good, fresh and served in these bread wall things that were great. Freshest bread and butter provided with the meal too. So fresh! The drinks were of course expensive, and the wine list is great too, but im not a wine drinker. So in short, the staff was fabulous, the food was good (a bit over priced in my opinion), but try the bourbon corn! OMG! Also, after dinner go over to Drinx, the bar right next to Sterlings, and have a drink with George the Scottish bartender. Damn, he is cool as hell and funny on top of it. I totally would have given this place a 4 star review, if the steak was not over cooked. The lamb and the gravy they provided with it was soooo goddamn good too."}, {"review_id": "IJtMSId7daapLewAwUN2Gg", "user_id": "zsOpnIzeZ09gSezIfmwOpQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Was in Reno for the weekend and needed dinner. Called in and made a same day reservation for a party of 4. Upon entering, you'll see wine bottles against the wall. Dim lighting inside. Our server brought us iced waters and complimentary bread (there were like 3 different kinds!). We ordered...Bone-In Ribeye - $49 Filet Mignon - $48 (Large Cut)Diver Scallops - $39Blue Point Oysters on the half shell - $28King Crab Mac n Cheese - $18Sautéed Spinach - $9New England Clam Chowder - $8The steaks came with sides such as a house salad and garlic mashed potatoes. Overall, the food was pretty good; from the complimentary bread to the sides and entrees. The oysters were fresh, filet mignon was tender, yummy mashed potatoes and spinach. The house salad came out in like a sweet chip wrap (you pick your own dressing, I did Caesar). Mac n cheese was good too. The scallops were alright, had a sweet red pepper coulis sauce (I wasn't sure what that was but it kinda tasted kinda like a sweet chili sauce lol). The polenta that came with it was too salty. Bone-in ribeye was more grilled/charred than I normally like but overall I enjoyed my experience there and most of the food.

I have eatin here before as I attend a trade show here and meetings twice a year.  A few years ago we had a horrible experience in a group of 16 and we never went back.  We started going to Roxie's. But tonight redeemed itself Are waiters we very kind.  We had a nice table in a corner. Nice and peaceful.   We started with the avocado and crab appetizer.  It was presented nicely and was very good    First course a lobster bisque and a chopped salad  again very nice But the kicker for me was our main I noticed that they a a deer medallion with fried kale and  spetzel.  I had to try it   It was presented beautifully  there was enough there for two.  I asked them to mesquite grill it which they did.  It was fabulous Fantastic time"}, {"review_id": "fD9evp59yOVIcpmfWa2QAg", "user_id": "scdg8JzDCyDC-QQTkFYChg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "My wife and I went to dinner at Sterling's Seafood Steakhouse for our anniversary this year.  We'd never been before, but had fairly high expectations based on the reviews here on TripAdvisor and elsewhere.  We had a 5pm reservation and we were seated right on time.  I had noted on our reservation that we were celebrating an anniversary, and they had a booth already reserved for us with some extra decoration and an anniversary card, which was a very nice touch.  For our entrees, my wife ordered a large filet mignon, oscar style.  I ordered the steak (filet mignon) and lobster.  Both of us requested the filet to be cooked medium.  The presentation of the food was excellent, and our waiter, Morgan, offered to remove my lobster tail from its shell for me, which I accepted.  My filet mignon was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.  My lobster tail was easily the best I've ever had.  My wife's filet mignon, however, was under-cooked and practically rare in the middle.  Morgan was very apologetic and offered to put have it put back on the grill for us.  It came back out a few minutes later, and was cooked as we had originally expected.  Despite the issue with my wife's filet, which was corrected quickly and to our expectations, all of the food we ate for dinner was excellent.For dessert, we decided to share the Tuxedo Decadence.  We originally planned to share the Triple Layer Fudge Cake, but thankfully Morgan let us know that it's huge (over a pound of dessert!), so we decided to go for something smaller.  The Tuxedo Decadence was absolutely amazing, and a great finish to our meal.During our meal, we also got a visit from Gary, the Restaurant and Wine Director, to apologize for the mistake with my wife's meal and to make sure we were satisfied with re-cooked filet as well as the rest of our meal.  We found out at the end of our meal that he also took our dessert and coffees off our bill to make up for our inconvenience.Overall, we had a fantastic anniversary dinner, and a great evening out together.  I understand that mistakes happen, and my only expectation is that when they do happen, they are taken care of quickly and professionally.   To that end, Morgan, Gary, and the rest of the Sterling's staff we interacted with completely met my expectations and helped to make sure we had a great dinner.  We will definitely be going back!"}, {"review_id": "rDA4fPoZQSosXcxTE1Q90A", "user_id": "b2oS5BgjMigy0_5oV4R-4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Walked in for a birthday dinner and was pleasantly surprised with the fantastic service throughout the meal.

We called for last minute on Saturday evening for reservations and had no trouble getting the time we requested. Located on the second floor of the Silver Legacy, its right in heart of the action. The atmosphere is very low key, sexy and a tad sophisticated. Our waiter was very professional and prompt. We had the surf & turf with filet minion and lobster, truffle mac n' cheese and Alaskan king crab, baked potato and broccolini. Each entree comes with either a salad or cup of clam chowder. Each dish was beautifully presented, fresh and delicious. The steak and lobster was cooked perfectly and had great flavor, but unfortunately the Alaskan king crab  was void of flavor. Possibly from being washed or previously frozen. This didn't take away from our overall meal, but it wasn't worth the hefty price and might prompt someone else to send it back.The tomato bread is a must try and the martinis are nice and dirty :) I recommend for a fancy date or special occasion."}, {"review_id": "S4DhpJfKZLfHrnqzDeuoNQ", "user_id": "7O89RcLc4C18x0aPZxMzng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So....sad news, Sterlings is going away and Ruth's Chris is taking its place.

First, the service: we were taken care of by Tim and his assistant Brian. Both of them were extremely accommodating, courteous, and kind, while also humoring our silly sense of humor. They make you feel special while also injecting a sense of warmth into the experience. The atmosphere: classy and elegant. You forget you're in a casino as soon as you walk in. The only thing I would've requested is a little candle burning on our table for that little hint of romance - but knowing clumsy me, I probably would've knocked it over and set the place on fire anyways.Most importantly, the food: we started our meal with the Escargot paired with some Ferrari-Carano Chardonnay (Russian River Valley.) These snails themselves are huge, meaty, and succulent, and they're swimming in a decadent butter garlic white wine sauce that is to die for! We loved lapping it up with the warm bread served beforehand.Next, he had the clam chowder and I had the dinner salad with vinaigrette. The clam chowder was delicious and creamy with big chunks of clams and potato. I highly recommend getting fresh pepper as it sends it over the edge. My salad came in a cookie cup (forgot what it's called - it's French!) which went so well together when I broke up that savory little cup and ate it with the salad. The vinaigrette is obviously house-made and chunkier than most, but you can tell it's made with high-quality olive oil and balsamic.For our main course, we got the Chateaubriand for two. It's basically a huge hunk of steak carved tableside with sides and veggies, plated right there in front of you, served with demiglace and Bearnaise sauces. The steak itself was juicy and flavorful, and when eaten together with the sauces, made for an absolute perfect bite of meat. The sides - garlic mashed potatoes and Parmesan risotto - were both so yummy, and the veggies were fresh and perfectly cooked. The portions are such that they do not let you leave hungry. We paired everything with our server's recommendation of another Ferrari-Carano wine, this time the Cab with just a hint of Merlot. Perfect pairing. We did not have room for dessert, but they still brought out a couple of chocolate-covered strawberries to top everything off. Overall, the experience was exactly what you would hope for when spending $100+ on a nice meal. It's definitely a special occasion place, of course, but it's worth every penny.Thank you Tim for an EXCELLENT experience and an evening to remember!"}, {"review_id": "y8fSufeY2Sp0_Dy0O7n-Ew", "user_id": "kZJWAY828P8QZTqVYzhTCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "Located at Silver Legacy, Sterling's Seafood Steakhouse is upscale for this area of Reno better known for buffets & casual dining. The dining room is outfitted in traditional white table cloths, dark wood panels, & romantic lighting. The temperature on my large filet mignon ($48) came out exactly as requested. With almost a dozen decadent sauces & toppers to choose from ($6 each), it was difficult to choose; enjoyed his Creamy Cognac Demi (for his Porterhouse, $49, which he called 4.5 stars), but we both preferred my Green Peppercorn Sauce. Two items I didn't care for were the House Salad's sweet crouton \"ring\" (savory croutons are a must!) & our side of Creamy Bourbon Corn (too much going on with the peppers & beans.) Aside from those two items, everything else made for a solid 4-star meal. Shrimp Scampi starter was topped with something I'd never seen on the dish before -- potato straws. Too full for dessert, but not too stuffed to end the meal with complimentary chocolate-covered strawberries!! Though there was quite a lag between ordering & receiving our entrees, Sterling's waitstaff gets an \"A\" for effort; our soda & water glasses were never empty, waiters were personable & provided good recommendations, & they handled a kitchen snafu with grace.

I mean, I get it, Reno itself has a lower standard because people don't come here for glamour--they come because it's close (to NorCal) and cheap! Based on my experience here, which will be my only and last, this place is nowhere close to 4.5 stars! Why?1) Service is SLOW. If you disagree with this, then service is inconsistent. We did witness the tables near us get a lot of attention whereas our server seemed careless. We definitely didn't feel taken care of. No smiles, no sense of urgency, nothing--our guy just wanted to go home.2) Employees were arguing while cleaning the big table in front of us. One younger Caucasian guy said something like, \"why am I cleaning your table?\" The other latin or middle eastern looking guy responded \"Just leave me alone.\" Was this racism? Good on him for squashing it, but we still felt the tension during our \"fancy\" meal.3) For what you get, the food is way overpriced. We got some prawns, oysters, and tuna for appetizers, none of which were worth the price point. The oysters were small, and the prawns/tuna tasted old.4) The Filet Mignon I had was nothing special. Sure, it might've been cut from the actual correct part of the cow but I doubt that it was anywhere close to high quality. The marbling was probably non-existent as evidenced by no taste. I mean, they're not fronting like they got \"grass-fed, wagyu, 30-day aged, etc.\" but the price for the flavor you get just isn't worth it. I should have drizzled A-1 steak sauce on it just to let them know how bad it was.I know, it's Reno! Just about everything is imported so the prices won't be that low.That doesn't give this place an excuse to have terrible/inconsistent service, poor employee conduct, and sub-par meats. It's better to just go elsewhere where you can get a better experience and potentially an actual tasty steak."}, {"review_id": "rWxqXUGdpjwX8kYOX4Wt6A", "user_id": "6wkK7jZPaYcNiy48MsyYrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2017", "text": "They didn't pay me to write this, but this place shines in a lot of ways.

I booked our reservations through Open Table and in the comments mentioned it was our fifth year wedding anniversary. When we showed up, about 20 minutes prior to our reservation, we were promptly seated. We were seated at a nice booth, decorated with confetti and a nice card from the management. Our server Erik, was wonderful. Pleasant, personable and professional. We both started with a nice glass of Trefethen merlot. For an appetizer we both had the French onion soup. Our meals came with the house salad and veggies. The house salad was presented nicely in a sweet crouton. I had the oil and vinegar house dressing while the husband had the basil dressing. The salad was nice, but the crouton was too sweet, even for me. We also ordered a side of asparagus to share. We both had the 11oz filet mignon. Mine was cooked medium and my husband's was rare with Stilton blue cheese and a Demi glaze on the side. Although I am not a fan of rare meat, I tried his and it was amazing! My husband couldn't stop talking about his steak. For a rare steak, it was perfectly seared and while red on the inside, not at all bloody. We settled on splitting a double espresso and the mint chocolate cheesecake. I ended up taking half of my meal home. The maitre'd Carlos checked in to see how our food was, and to congratulate us on our anniversary. At the end of the night he also comped off our dessert and espresso. We have dined at a lot of steak house in the area, Bimini's at Peppermill, Charlie Palmers at the GSR, The Steak house at the Atlantis. Roxy's at the Eldorado, the steakhouse at the Western Village, and this is in my top two for the area. Is it expensive? Yes, but not in comparison to the others in the area. After three glasses of wine, two steak dinners and a side, after tip and tax we spent $230.00 for the two of us."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sterlings-seafood-steakhouse-reno-4?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
