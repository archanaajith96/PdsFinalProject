The food is unbelievable!!! We had chicken souvlaki pita, moussaka, tomato and bean soup, and spanakopita. Everything was fantastic! The portions were huge and we way overordered but we are super happy to eat the food again for dinner. The owners are super nice and friendly. Absolutely worth the detour from Route 15!"}, {"review_id": "5_ZDdqe3iWRFy61qOZrCZA", "user_id": "ijOZLZDhQZ7nLLig5Yhdeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "We were looking for authentic Greek food and it is with great apprehension that we drove to Eva's Deli.  The reviews online were stellar but the pictures and Decor were not representative of the typical 5 star baring establishments we usually read about. This restaurant is the perfect example to never judge a book by its cover!Driving over half an hour to experience it, you might be shocked From the average churn appeal of the restaurant from the Christmas lights still outside in august, to the very lax \" cafetetia-store \" lcasual environment, various different restaurant name signs inside and out, a mish mash of grocery refrigerators and 1950's wood floors with basic utility tables.and chairs, first impressions can be deceiving.  Then, you take a peak at the laminated colour printed menus next to the greek newspapers, ouzo bottles and  ornamental statuettes and you see the left side lettering of menu items written In Greek alphabet and the right side in English, hmmm authentic sounding! Then, you witness Eva the owner and her husband behind the counter and kitchen grill and you realise omg! This is the real deal! A hole in a wall restaurant that is synonymous of authentic, amazing food operated by a genuine Greek family...We started with the brothy homemade lentil soup which came with a basket of fresh in-house baked bread that was delicious.  Then, a satziki appetiser that helped  determine that this was going to be an authentic greek dining experience.  See, most places that serve satziki sauce use fillers like sour cream to sacrifice taste and costs, but not here at Eva's: real yogurt, cucumbers and garlic make up this amazing wow factor starter that will linger onto our table for meats and potatoes as a dip for the remainder of the meal.  A fantastic baked cheese puff and a simple greek salad served family style rounded out the starters, and we just had begun the greek feast!I never had authentic calamari, I mean everywhere they serve the heavy breaded deep fried portion that is universally known for the onion like pub dish.  Here, it is charbroiled with lemon and garlic, the result is a fluffy not rubbery delightful plate that can be shared quickly.  The gyro and chicken souvkaki plates were very good and similar to what is known at most greek food serving joints.The owners insisted that we try their bakery and sweets and how could we resist the giant cheesecake with strawberries, the baklava and angel hair roll with walnuts that were not overly sweet at all, just right and \"airy light\", forgetting anything about calories!Finishing off with authentic greek coffee (which is similar to a strong espresso) and chatting with the family was an unforgettable experience complete with simplicity and class that you should treat yourself to; come hungry!"}, {"review_id": "ygvbVAC2AKvbrvwTcJ3aeA", "user_id": "1_g5acZvgstFfd4LBE32NQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Absolutely the best Greek restaurant in Fairfield County.

Speaking of dinner, we started off with one of our Greek favorites; Tzatziki.  This was hands-down, by far, the best Tzatziki we've ever had.  As we write this, our mouths are watering as we recall the light, creamy deliciousness of this home-made treat (Eva makes her own yogurt from scratch) and the warm, fresh pita bread and Greek olives with which it was served.  As far as the entrees, we shared the Pasticcio (which was served with oven baked potato wedges) and a Chicken Gyro (which was served with a tasty Greek side salad, a Dolmathakia [a grape leaf stuffed with rice and herbs] and home-made, hand-cut potato fries). The portions were generous and very filling.         While some may view the atmosphere as spartan (no pun intended), for us, it was this austere simplicity that allowed its genuine European charm to shine through.  Even the toughest critics would have to agree, that once this food hits your taste buds, the bright lights of the Greek Gods seem to shine down from the heavens and blind you to everything but the pure deliciousness of these culinary delights (think along the lines of Meg Ryan in the Diner scene from \"When Harry Met Sally\").           Thank you to Eva and George (Eva's husband who is busy cooking and grilling in the back kitchen) for a wonderfully authentic Greek dining experience.  We're looking forward to seeing you again soon; and the next time we'll be sure to save some room so we could try your yummy looking, home-made desserts!UPDATE: Writing this review inspired us to return to Eva's for a second time this week.  We again started with the Tzatziki, and it was every bit as delicious as the first time.  Wishing to explore other menu items, this time we tried the Shrimp Santorini (prepared to order by George with a tomato sauce, feta, shrimp and red peppers [substituted for green peppers] over spaghetti) and traditional Spanakopita (made with spinach, onions and feta under layers of phyllo pastry dough).  A plentiful side salad preceded the pasta.  Everything was super fresh and tasty.  But again, we were just too full and had to pass on the tempting desserts.  Eva, being a gracious hostess brought us a sample of a Greek custard, which was worthy of every calorie!  We can't wait to go back to Eva's again and again...!"}, {"review_id": "ggq4ezmL3QZCqNjXSwspbA", "user_id": "I9oeMWQD_bS-PLVmRCfgjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/18/2016", "text": "This is an authentic delicious little family Greek restaurant.

The gyro platter is enormous, couldn't finish it. The Greek  frappe is like a strong iced coffee and delicious! The desserts are to die for. You don't get any more authentic than this place! The make the Greek yogurt on site. Never have I found another place that makes the yogurt, even my second favorite place in Milford uses Fage brand. Everything in this place is homemade and authentic. And the owners are so nice, they served us like we were family. I will never eat another diner gyro or moussaka again.

I spent a lot of time in Chicago's Greek Town so I was excited to try this spot.  I ordered saganaki which was not on the menu but she said they can do it for me.  I enjoyed the cheese even though it wasn't flaming. Very friendly people. They seemed excited to have a non Greek there in the restaurant. Four other tables were filled with locals (if you were in Athens).After the saganaki I had their \"small\" Greek salad. It was fresh and not small, a perfect start   I also ordered the pasticho (Greek lasagna) which was served just like my Greek friends mom used to make it. It was delicious and huge. My thanks to Eva and the chef who's name I did not get.
