I always getting the super pocket, and absolutely love it. Seriously one of the best restaurants in Fayetteville, it's absolutely delicious. There aren't a lot of seats, so on Saturdays it might be a few minutes wait, but it's never too long! Also on your birthday you get free baklava!"}, {"review_id": "zyiebUp7UihochB9m0U_IA", "user_id": "WZZZsGdz7ZcJPjPySdDPlw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Delicious, great prices, tasty food. Second best falafel in town. Fash is the best in my opinion, though. Good service but could use more hours of availability and more seating. I hope this Cafe expands in the future.

It's a very small space, only 3 tables, a handful of seats at the bar area and a few at the window. In total, I'd say this place seats no more than 20 people. So definitely not a place for a large group. The food is really great and authentic. Homemade everything! I've seen some reviews say that they just reheat stuff, but I've never had that experience. I always get the Turkish coffee- it's a small cup but full of great flavors. In fact, when I'm done with the cup I asked for some hot water to mix with some of the spices still left at the bottom, so it's kinda like 2 cups for the price of one! I got the Petra plate which is a variety of goodness. I do have to say that the falafel was a bit dry this time, but usually is really good. We got there right at noon on a Saturday before what seemed like the lunch crowd so we had seating options. We had great, quick service, but I could tell that not everyone else in the place could have said the same. I will definitely be going back to try more stuff, and of course indulge in some Turkish coffee !"}, {"review_id": "_hIql-x_KVADE9j0ucl5Fg", "user_id": "pI60j6-aFnTWoGw8PyGlaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "So much flavor in their dishes!

It was around lunch time and the place was pretty crowded. The space is pretty small so there is not a lot of seating side. I decided to just order take out and go eat outside since it was a beautiful, warm day. There is street parking out front and nearby parking lots. I'm not positive on whether nearby parking lots are open to the public or reserved. I parked on the street where it is metered parking. I've been wanting to come here for a while because of the great recommendations, but it has been hard to get down here before they close most days. Luckily I made it and got to have some of their deliciousness! The customer service was friendly and helpful. I placed a order and had about a 20 minute wait so I went in a few nearby stores while I waited. I could be wrong, but this place is not wheelchair or stroller friendly. Unless there is another entrance that I'm not aware of (which there could be), you have to go up stairs to get in. Normally I wouldn't care if I was alone, but I had my kid and baby with me and it was hard to carry the stroller up the stairs. To enter you go up stairs and enter doors. To the left is Petra and to the right is another restaurant. There could be some back entrance into the building I'm not aware of, but I will double check next time I make it down here to eat.The food was great! We had the grape leaves platter with a side of hummus - delicious! I love grape leaves!! I also ordered the \"super pocket\" and \"chicken pocket\" and they were delicious as well. My 4 year old loved the \"pockets\", grape leaves and hummus! I recommend this place and will come back!"}, {"review_id": "oTxch6mYZrqRwRsegqkxAA", "user_id": "cgF6N2b00TJioS0pYwOSYg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2017", "text": "If you're looking for a great little authentic hole in the wall for Mediterranean food, I'd pass on this place. While the food is good (not disgusting to eat), it didn't hit the spot in regard to what I was craving.I ordered a very simple dish - falafel pocket - and it took a LONG time to get. While my husband and I were waiting, we observed that the gyros meat was being taken out of a box. It wasn't even made on the premise. When I received my meal, the falafel wasn't crispy like I anticipated. Also, it was more like a burrito or wrap, not a pita pocket. This was such a disappointment, because the place has such great reviews.

I love the owner and staff. The place gets busy sometimes and there might be a wait since it is a small space but I wouldn't change it at all. You know its a sign that it has fantastic food if there is a line.I get my usual which is the number 4 hummus plus with a side of grape leaves and extra falafels. If I'm still feeling peckish, I order a grilled cheese sandwich on wheat. It's nothing special except the love and care they butter that toast and let that American cheese melt perfectly. If you are there on Mondays, they have tomato soup.Great local place and I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for Jordanian/Mediterranean food. Fresh, vegetarian (if you don't get gyros), and a local place.

The Hummus Plus platter also came with three falafel with tahini sauce, a generous portion of hummus, pita points and a side of tabouli. The chef told me to just let him know if I needed any more pita or anything else. Everyone there seemed to love the place and enjoy life. It was a welcome reprieve from a stressful day!
