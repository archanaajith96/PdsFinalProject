PROST!Cerrone's is a locally owned and operated pizzeria that cooks brick oven pizza and prides themselves on authentic New York style pizza! The shop has participated in the largest U.S. competition for pizza and even placed 3rd place for 2016 & 2017! So that in itself means you have to check them out!They are located in a small shopping center nestled off of Vetarans Pkwy with private parking. I ordered the MIGHTY MUSHROOM with extra shrooms...A beautiful pie made with fresh mozzarella, a delectable porcini mushroom cream sauce, lightly seasoned crimini mushrooms, and imported romano cheese. The overall taste of the pie is very mild and light. I myself added a red pepper flakes and requested the BEST side of blue cheese evah!Now, back to what brings me here... I love that they offer a wide selection of craft beers and wine all from local wineries and breweries in Georgia... You can even get sample servings for like 2.00 bucks! To cleanse the pallet I ordered the \"Killjoy\" which so happened to be light, crisp and most enjoyed!For desert I was treated to one of their cannolis, but you can and should scoop you up some of them (2 for $5.50) The shells are flown in from Brooklyn which make you feel like you are really experiencing a true treat and the filling is made in house! The shell is light and flakey and the ricotta mixture is airy and mildly sweet which = to all sorts of YUM."}, {"review_id": "V9b7CUIURXLbO32zI67Htw", "user_id": "Nm6awCgUDrfLyOb1zveKog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "This Pizza is smack yo momma good! lol, ​This is REALLY an authentic​ Italian spot.The location is hidden on Veterans​ Pkwy so if you're​ speeding you will​ definitely​ pass it, it's in the cut.​When I​ walked into​ the restaurant​ the staff were really friendly and warm.

If you are a Pizza lover/aficionado I guarantee you that you will love it. You can taste the freshness of the Pizza and its ingredients. I have recommended this place to many friends and we all agree they are the best you can have in Columbus. Now, if you think that Papa Johns/ Dominoes are good pizzas, you might want to extend your paladar with more than cardboard/ rubbery tasting pizza. Definitely try it, let me know what you think or if you find somewhere else."}, {"review_id": "XpaoRHZdPd3WET6DaFgEkw", "user_id": "StSCpYmdktDTKpumTBnwMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "We love this place.

One guy from NY even claimed, \"it's the best pizza I've had outside of NYC\", so I had to give it a try. I can't attest to the NYC claim, but I can honestly say it's the best pizza I've ever had.

We called in a to-go order for an alla vodka pizza, a spinach Gorgonzola salad, and two cannoli's. When my boyfriend went in to pick it up, there was a guy standing at the register texting who didn't acknowledge my boyfriend at all. Another employee came out a few minutes later and took care of our order. The pizza was warm even when we got home and the spinach in the salad was fresh, so that was nice. The pizza barely had any sauce on it though, and you definitely couldn't tell that it was alla vodka, the mozzarella on it was fresh but it didn't have any flavor (needed salt or something) and it was really rubbery. The crust on the pizza was good though. We ended up dipping the pizza in a can of sauce we had at home and that made it bearable. We were told that most people order balsamic dressing with the salad we got, so that's what we chose. When we got home we found out that the dressing was simply balsamic vinegar, which was way too tart to eat on the salad. The salad sounded really good but the taste was underwhelming, perhaps it needed more cranberries. The cannoli's were pretty good though- the filling wasn't too sweet and it had a nice hint of citrus. Overall, it wasn't the worst epizza I've ever had, but it definitely wasn't the best."}, {"review_id": "RS2rtcwnXmX8_Bi5xcifJg", "user_id": "-NnrOHVSc8TvWpLXKNjgtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "Visited once, then again a month later... they remembered my face and that was awesome!

My husband is from NY and super picky about pizza. This is the one place in town he will get pizza from. We do take out a lot, but it's also fun to eat there if you don't go during peak times (place is small and when it's busy it's cramped) because the beer and cider selection is top notch! Just a heads up that the pizza sizes shown on the menu board are a joke-they are much bigger so don't be surprised if your \"personal\" pizza feeds two. The salads are huge too!

Cerrone's is the real deal. Order at the counter or grab a menu and a seat then order after pondering your choices. The choices are Specialty or Build Your Own. Today we chose the \"Smoking Cerrone\" with handmade sausage. There was flavor in every bite, from the sauce to the cheese to the bell peppers. Do you like thin or thick crust? Thick crust lovers stay away, this was the best crust i have had in a pizza, i often leave the edges but not these, not an edge left in sight. They have an excellent craft beer selection. Service and staff was warm (friendly) and good. They have one outside table, maybe 10 inside. I think they will expand in the near future to accommodate the Pizza Lovers of the South. We will be back to try the many choices of NY thin curst pizza and recommend you give it a try on your next road trip to or thru Columbus Ga."}, {"review_id": "ME6maPk9oUP3UbmxCNZLqQ", "user_id": "-D8n6z8XwLYDbzkvEqT3cA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2016", "text": "Pizza!
