You order in line, pay at the other end of line. Where you pay is also where the food comes out, meets drink and sauce area so it gets very congested. Tried all the sauces before the food came out, 3 for sauces. I ordered 2 meat plate with turkey and sausage. Best turkey in KC, sausage had great flavor but a casing that wasn't the best. Beans and potato salad both get a 5. My wife had ribs and burnt ends. Ribs were a bit chewy but burnt ends were delicious. We also shared 6 smoked wings which were pretty good as well, liked that they fried after smoking so not rubbery.   Overall good bbq, place is congested and loud but a great option for the area."}, {"review_id": "22npZ9iaQmM9Cx5EmzCQQA", "user_id": "O9FxgZUQe2RWCeWjul8oJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "My second time here.  Was fabulous both times.Ordered the Tuesday special each time I was here.My new favorite barbq place!"}, {"review_id": "nMSEOdQbsTuAPxTHwc92pQ", "user_id": "gwkme4gHuyZg8EXTOw6x8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Great barbecue and a cool atmosphere.

It has now became one of my top picks for BBQ. I appreciate the variety of sauces offered & the multitude choices of sides. The Mac n cheese is very creamy and well uh cheesy! I like the spiciness of the sausage and the smoky flavor of the pork. I usually get a sandwich but have tried the bowls. The bowls are a good option if you like your food served together.

Why come here? Beans and their barbecue sauces are both rockin, but that's like watching Back to the Future II for the extras hanging out at the soda shop. Cole slaw isn't bad, but it isn't the wow of Q39, more Jack's-lite. Smoke is the thing, and there's just not a very impressive Smokey taste to their brisket is you eat it straight. It's kind of bland and a bit tough. Their sausage is made without the meat being cold enough so it's grainy and gritty. It's cafeteria order, drop to your table service, which is fine, but if the cue doesn't hold a smoker to Joe's, why are you here?"}, {"review_id": "GLO3uJlRr622UvlT0QwAWQ", "user_id": "gNkmQPOhOQA5dAu6a9EwgQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "It's hard to give a single rating to this restaurant because it really depends on what you order.

Each piece of burnt ends was juicy, tender, and had a great flavor.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the brisket. Overall, I'd still recommend this place if you want a quick BBQ lunch/dinner for the following reasons: the lines are short, the service is quick, and the portions were on point.

I headed to Yelp and this place was a couple of miles from where I was working. I've eaten a lot of BBQ in a lot of places, and I think this place is great. The food was hot and flavorful -- those beans and the spicy southwest sauce have a good kick to them and the meats were cooked perfectly. I had to get the burnt ends and I think turkey is a good test of any pit master since it is way too easy to dry out.Service was fast and very friendly and the prices are reasonable. Even after I received my food, someone stopped by to make sure I was doing ok and happy with my choices.

Think City BBQ, but significantly better. (Sorry, not sorry)The restaurant itself is clean and tidy and the staff at this specific location treats you with the upmost respect. The service was surprisingly fast considering how good the food was as well. So it's good for coming in to grab a quick meal, or to spend your time sitting down inhaling their great and fulfilling meals.Parking is sufficient as they have their own parking lot and the time period we went (5ish) wasn't too busy at all. Price point wasn't insane either for what you get. It's around $11 for a full meal that will leave your belly incredibly full. (You might as well unbutton those pants now and loosen that belt)I would highly recommend the burnt ends, obviously they got their name from this, and the pulled pork. The sides are just as good and I'd recommend the macaroni, coleslaw, or the chili cheese fries. The Texas toast is even some of the best toast I've ever had the pleasure of devouring.Overall, if you're in the Kansas City area, I'd definitely recommend this place to dine at.

It isn't something I've seen at other joints around KC, but it may exist. I've been here a couple of times, and I keep getting it. I'm normally not someone who likes a bunch of food thrown together and touching. I'm not Monk level where I demand separate plates for each item, but I do enjoy eating things separately. Something about the combination of burnt ends, beans, cornbread, and onion straws really works for me. They have a lot of unique sauces, and I like trying a little bit of each. The burnt ends are not my absolute favorite in the city, but they are the closest burnt ends to my house, which does give them a few extra points.

The meat, the smoke, the fat, the caramelization of sugar salt, spices... so much flavor pack into those little half inch cubes of heaven. Ive only got it to go... perfect meal. Tonight saw some of the NBC Thursday night football bus crew getting it to munch on it in that palatial bus parked out back.  You have to wonder, if these guys are here, that's sayin something right? I mean they go all over the US where great BBQ is dominate, Texas, Tennessee, Carolinas, Kansas, etc. one of the crew was ordering and apologizing when I came in unaware  he was on the Bus. He was placing a second order of burnt ends. Apparently what ever they ordered first was not enough. He obviously drew the short straw to have to venture out of the warm bus, cross the parking lot on a blistering 20 degree night to order more grub.Well like those folks, I am totally happy with my burnt ends smoked turkey and beans and slaw Tonight well worth bentuteingbout on a cold snowy night in KC.GO RAIDERS!"}, {"review_id": "aIWpUTHLqKBOUl536NQqdw", "user_id": "UPEawh4nQkoWopeeyVMhUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "This is our go to place for Burnt ends.
