You already know. I'm in the fast lane. From LA to OK, yo.I'm just a boy, standing in front of Pie Junkie, asking it to be a Salad.I mean, I love pies, and these are amazing, but salads are good too, and way better for you. But who am I kidding. You're here to eat some pie. As I did in the hotel room that same night. But I digress. Let's focus on the Pie Junkie pies instead.PJs, which will make you so rotund, you'll only venture out of your house in plus size PJs, is absolutely delicious. Some of the best pies and even better service. Five stars all the way. The slices are a little pricey at $4.50 but it's worth every bite. The sour cherry which is only on Tuesday was good. The Key Lime Pie was even better - spectacular. Even better was the wonderful apple crumble. I especially love the pastry. Really delicious stuff.I highly recommend you check these people out and give their pies at try. The girls working here are so adorable as well. They gave me a bunch of extra cherries because they liked me. And I like them too. I like when girls give me cherries. Am I right. Seriously though, I've definitely noticed that since I shaved off my body hair and started wearing muscle shirts I get a lot more bonuses and free stuff LOL. It's cute how visual people are. Says he who is constantly showing off. Or maybe I'm just really friendly. But no it's definitely gotten more consistent lately. Awesome. Thanks PJ!But yeah, the Apple Crumb and the Lime, the best 2 so far. They also have a stamp card! What are they, a bubble tea shop? So awesome! Pie stamps! But if you get addicted to these slices, you may want to stamp out your habit.So if you start to CRYWhen you first taste this PIEI know the reason WHYSo good you'll want to DIEAnd I'm not going to LIEAt Arbuckle's. they FRYBut I cannot DENYI'm a Junkie for this PIEDamn I used Pie twice. Well maybe one was the food type of pie and the other was, oh man is that the time, I'm late for work."}, {"review_id": "JT5EXY6kpEwzh0Uu7BsguQ", "user_id": "7MM2RRrgEdR7D9HTs-sfQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update: ALMOND JOY IS TO DIE FOR.

This shop is so cute and everyone is so friendly. I've been coming here since before moving out of state (while in undergrad, my roommate and I made road trips for pie, oops), and I recently stopped back in for Pi Day. It's just as good as I remember it. The staff is incredibly efficient and passionate about pie. The pie itself is marvelous. My favorites include the drunken turtle, peanut butter, French silk, and the coconut cream (no pictures unfortunately because I have no self control around pie). You really can't go wrong, and the slices are generous, so don't worry about the price tag; you're getting a huge made from scratch piece of deliciousness. This is definitely my favorite business in the plaza district, and I'm looking forward to stopping in the next time I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "ZdDYyXlC0e3b_JMCHb0DEA", "user_id": "5uA4g7dEQD0TIr3jjRtJhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "The best pie in town.

A family member told me about this place and I was all over it! I purchased a whole buttermilk pie (only $19.99) and a slice of pecan pie. Mannn their crust is flaky and buttery. They clearly make the crust themselves and boyyy is it good! The filling is sweeet and tastes similar to what I was expecting. I also tried a slice of the Drunken Turtle pie that my cousin got and that was by far the best pie I got to try from Pie Junkie so far. The chocolate, the caramel, the nuts were all so good. If you're to get a slice of pie from pie junkie try the Drunken Turtle Pie. Well worth it!

Their selection is creative but classic and really tasty. It's a small spot but most people seem to carry out, so seating doesn't seem to be an issue. In addition to the good pies, the staff is amazingly enthusiastic and even gave us a free slice because it wasn't pretty enough for sale. That's the type of service that makes a repeat customer. If you're down in the Plaza and looking for a sweet spot after drinks or dinner, definitely stop in.

They have incredible tasting pies and a great selection. The peanut butte chocolate was my favorite, but you really have to like peanut butter for this one. The graham cracker crust really takes it over the top. The Drunken Turtle Pie was really good as well with a scoop of ice cream on top, great caramel topping. A friend got the Bird Dog Buttermilk pie with whipped cream, really rich and sweet tasting."}, {"review_id": "9gGj1nX1l5lf3IwxB5VgKw", "user_id": "6pJICQMKi7CjMIKU-y9oTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "This is a no brainer. Delicious pies, great variety. Favorites are fruit crumbles (all varieties are delicious)- drunken turtle - peanut butter & (seasonal) orange bourbon pecan. Their bourbon whip cream is quite tasty also. Order early for Thanksgiving; nonetheless I scored a whole pie drunken turtle (they had a handful leftover) at 1:00 on the Wed- before-thanksgiving. Friendly staff. A punch card system. If you're into comparisons: slices are slightly smaller-- but $2 less (better value overall) than Antoinette's in Tulsa. Overall I've found the everyday varieties to be slightly tastier here. I.e., these gals know what a pie monger needs.

Key Lime Pie - Taste like regular key lime but the highly was the crust! Also, eat chilled.3. Blackberry - Tart and textured filling; the star was the top layer.

I had the pecan, and tasted my buddies peanut butter pie, mine was better. They got drinks to purchase, but what caught my eye was the complimentary water and coffee. The black coffee went great with my slice. Like most joints in the Classen Ten Penn area the place is small and packed on the weekends. With that said, the ladies behind the counter were great and so were the other patrons.
