The smell when you walk in is incredible!The Holmes:Really good pizza, the crust was nice and chewy and blackened at some points. The prosciutto was a tad on the salty side and we were able to request extra toppings like jalapeños. It was great to split with two people. A plus is you get to see the oven in the back!Strozzapreti:This pasta was delicious and for a dollar more they split it for you. Was nice filling, I wouldn't recommend ordering an appetizer if you split a pasta. The meat was nice and fine and spread out in every bite. The noodles were nice and tender without being too soggy. The pasta was in a fun shape to eat and was able to capture the right amount of sauce in each bite!"}, {"review_id": "pRHeLBPqHS8MSgyARl-BjA", "user_id": "VSgUIuwDiMBG7mAGxGqwqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm lucky to have this spot nearby in Clayton for lunch.  There are several good lunch specials always on the menu including the salad and pasta, and you get a few selections of each (salad and type of pasta and sauce).My regular order of kale salad and strozapretti noodle with bolognese was again good today.  The bolognese and pasta was served very hot right off the stove.  Sit at the seats overlooking the kitchen if you are a party of one or two.  You get to see the fresh ingredients being used."}, {"review_id": "Opp_glCPGvfjVkzy-BVL_A", "user_id": "ohYnCSs6eTl7O6o3UySpgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "This place was a blast!Love the open seating space and large long bar!

I ate all of it! This is not the type of pizza you want to share! Perfectly crispy crust, great fresh toppings, and perfectly cooked! It paired very well with the local brews I was consuming!

They have outdoor seating  where noise travels freely above your head if you want to avoid children's screams and have a more quiet dining experience. Great waiters, great staff! Lots of parking including garage. It has a very casual ambiance. We got there fairly early, and lucked out with no wait time!Now to our drinks and food. They have good beer choices, wine, and bar drinks. My Italian beer was just perfect. They have a tri-bowl with olive oil, parmesan type of cheese, and a chili oil (I think) where you can prepare your own dipping oil for the bread. So that was a cute start, play with that and nibble before the meal. That cheese is real, and real good.We ordered some starters and they were really good! Brussel sprouts and they were phenomenal, and the cauliflower had a delicious lemony taste with pine nuts; it was one of the best we have had! My husband ordered a pasta dish and it was somewhat al-dente, he love it. I ordered a pizza, which is a must since they make it very traditional Neapolitan way! Wow! It was exceptional!   Pizza lovers take note, and do try it!"}, {"review_id": "Em-pdnxwGKFmBKf11ACWnQ", "user_id": "50V3UxV1yeHnnXKQWKD0pA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "I loved the whole experience at Pastaria. It's a unique, modern Italian restaurant that absolutely nails their pastas and pizzas.We had a little group here and the service was great -- timely and with great recommendations. I punted the pasta decision to her and she said try the Pistachio Ravioli (pistachio, mint, lemon brown butter, Grana Padano) and it was very good, and unique. I'd say if you like pistachios at all, jump on this but if not, you're taking a gamble as it's has some strong, particular flavors. The pizzas here were fan-freaking-tastic. The classic Italian style pizzas cooked in a 900 degree oven with perfect bubbles in the crust, a perfectly slight chew, an an excellent flavor. The quality was equally evident with the Italian bread they brought out, I could've gorged on that fresh-baked bread for my entree to be honest. Throw in some wine with your order, take in the big open seat plan and modern layout and enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "x_S9WvhPakggWB8D4mmcGw", "user_id": "ScQ8bcyD05fGBTc03qtJ8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "One of my favorite places to eat in STL!

For those of you who would like to hear of Pastaria's wonder, where do I even start!? The food. Service and ambiance are good things (and both are top notch at Pastaria) but the food is everything. We started with the crispy risotto balls, and I wish I could eat them daily. Imagine the best mozzarella stick you've had times a million in deliciousness. Then they give you a huge piece of crusty on the outside, fluffy on the inside bread with oil, parm & chili oil. SO. GOOD. Then I faced the dilemma of pizza or pasta, so my husband and I got both: The pizza of the day and the toasted spaghetti and clams. The pizza was really good- the crust was the best part! But we were fighting over that pasta, oh my Lord it was so good. You can tell it's fresh, made in house pasta and the toasted flour in it brings a unique, nutty flavor.This place is basically perfect- killer atmosphere, great for families or a date night, upscale, but not stuffy, and amazing service. Huge shout out to Jason for the awesome service and recommendations after just one month at Pastaria! I can't wait to go back to try more!

With Pastaria, his love for all things Italian is on full-display, and it's pretty impressive when you keep in mind the oversaturated Italian food scene in St. Louis.For Neopolitan pizza fanatics, Pastaria should be at the top of your list. They've perfected the craft of the wood-fired pie, and it stands among the very best pizzas that I've had to date. For purists, go for the Margherita, and don't look back. The crust has a wonderful, bouncy bite, with the authentic char on various sides of the crust that balance well with the SM tomatoes & mozzarella. Going forward, I'll probably exclusively order pizzas when I come here - they're that good.Ironically enough, despite what their name indicates, I wasn't overly impressed with the pasta...I tried the Cacio e Pepe, which was the recommendation of many, though I found it to be a bit bland. The noodles, however, were obviously fresh & perfectly al dente - I just wish there was more flavor to be found.Nonetheless, Pastaria continues Mr. Craft's streak of phenomenal restaurants, offering something new & modern to traditionally business-centric area that is downtown Clayton."}, {"review_id": "QGt1kCA0llNLANhCQrh_kA", "user_id": "SNxhKVapIpAkrpYlj3L75g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "This has got to be one of the best, if not the best pasta house in all of the greater St. Louis area!  All pasta is made fresh on the premises, as is the dough used for their fantastic pizzas.

I know this isn't Italy, but we're also not in NYC either. Dinner for two was over $100 before the tip. Location is great with parking in the garage (in the same Bldg a plus), atmosphere inside casual, and the menu pretty basic. Service could've been better but there was nothing upsetting about it. Water glasses filled and splashed, bread plopped on the table. The food was just ok - we happened to order several things that were lemony, and I do really like garlic white wine lemon sauces. Apps of risotto balls and tomato salad (shared) - balsamic dressing was great on the tomato, and the risotto balls were light and cooked jut right.Mains of salmon and the toasted pasta (I know - weird) with clams - the salmon was salmon. The pasta with clams was disappointing. The clams wee absolute rubber, and in strips that looked like jerky. The heavy garlic and wine sauce saved the dish. Finished the meal with a shared tiramisu, which was very good - not too sweet and fresh.

I love a pasta specialty shop so my expectations were high, but the pasta i got was just okay.  i had the pistachio ravioli and the filling inside was super salty. Like as if you bought those salted/roasted pistachios and crushed them up and added some more salt and then said okay that's the filling. The pasta itself was also underwhelming, it was similar in quality to the Lean Cuisine ravioli i sometimes buy. Finally, it was described as having lemon and mint flavors, but they were absent. it was just swimming in butter. Don't get me wrong i love butter, but it wasn't enough to boost this pasta to a level that justifies the price tag. As a vegetarian i would skip this place, maybe the dishes with meat are more exceptional.

The bread and oil provided pre-dinner were also delicious. Everything is decently priced. The pizzas are also quite large for the price. The real star of the night was the gelato, surprisingly.

We were a large party, about 15. My sister called ahead and was assured that if we arrived at five we would be seated without a problem (they had been before and knew the place often had a wait). We showed up early and the place was already full (which I took as a good sign- gotta be good food, right?) and we were told a 45-1hr wait. Despite the 5 children we had with us, we decided to stick it out and wait- my niece had her heart set on the bread and pasta. After 45 minutes, we returned. That 45 minute wait turned into an hour and a half wait. They made plenty of cash off the drinks we ordered at the bar while waiting and waiting and waiting. After being sat at an overcrowded table we waited again. At this point the kids are \"sooooo hungry!!\". We are each given one slice of bread. The dipping sauce and parm were very good- but we were all very hungry. What happened to a basket of bread for a table of 15? The bread here is so special- only one slice per person. I ordered the minestrone soup- FYI NOT SOUP. There were maybe two beans in it (which they name much fancier on the menu, everything on the menu sounds oh so very fancy). Honestly this soup tasted like canned diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning and a splash of olive oil. I was really hungry at this point but it was just spiced tomatoes. There was no broth to speak of. To our server's credit she comped us the 8$ soup when she saw I barely ate it. The kids meals arrived about 10 minutes before any of the adult meals(spread out arrival there, poor planning for such pricey place). We were glad the kids finally had food but then they just had to wait around till the kitchen gradually caught up to the rest of the table. I am not exaggerating when I say it took 20 minutes for the entire table to be served their entrees. No one was really impressed with their meal- good, sure, but not great. They all knew I \"yelped\" and asked me to express how poor our experience was here. Our server was very nice. Unfortunately, a nice server doesn't make up for such an overpriced, poorly executed establishment. If I had to sum this place up-  if there's a wait it's not worth it. Also despite the kindness of the server I expect A LOT more for the price. We left disappointed and annoyed- exactly how you should feel after a nice indulgent night out, right?  Go for date night- perhaps they can handle a party of two.I'm a pretty positive yelper... But I stand by 1 star. The two people that split the bill asked if there was such a thing as half a star."}, {"review_id": "skCw9JiLf_i_90ZNP_rFrw", "user_id": "8FEM4a-mDMMARWmlqAHCEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Visited Pastaria last night and the food was amazing!!!

Upon coming into the restaurant, you see the kitchen & chefs hard at work. The entire decor is very inviting & bright. We got sat down very close to others, which wasn't very comfortable but it worked. The menu itself has many delicious choices from pizza made with homemade pepperoni(pictured), pasta(also pictured), soup and salads & various freshly juiced drinks. I was so impressed with the way the menu was setup & how easy it was to decide what to pick. We ordered the Italian ramen, & the white noodles which i don't remember the name of, and pepperoni pizza with mushrooms. My friend got the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice & i got tomato juice. The grapefruit juice was SO delicious. My rating on the pizza is 5 stars ++++. The pepperonis had so much flavor & the crust was perfectly crispy. The noodles get a 3 star for me because the cheese overpowered the taste & the kitchen forgot to include chicken in it. From what i saw, the Italian ramen was very delicious but there was not much difference from what other ramen tastes like. The reason why I'm giving Pastaria a four star rating is because service wasn't the best. The waitresses and waiters seemed very out of it & rushed. Also, there was one waitress who wasn't wearing a bra and her boobies were all over the place. I get it that she's probably all for women empowerment but please don't have your nipples obviously hanging down your shirt at work. It seemed that management didn't have an issue with her boobies being everywhere but it made me uncomfortable."}, {"review_id": "_JJslaR9iyTDm2ZTGnOv4g", "user_id": "ALyOhGFdL2f5mCd8JuKvig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Whoever doesn't give this place a 5 star rating needs to be kicked off of the internet.
