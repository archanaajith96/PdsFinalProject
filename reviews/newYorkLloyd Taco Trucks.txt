I'd like to thank the Lloyd Taco trucks for purging my picky eating habits and opening a whole new world of awesome, different foods to me. Lloyd will always have a very special place in my heart. I started following the trucks around after quickly falling in love with their burritos - I'd go anywhere Lloyd went when I was itching for a burrito, even to random parking lots in the middle of winter. I would head out early on a Saturday morning to catch their breakfast burrito special. We'd park by Canalside just to get a pulled pork burrito. I'll bike to a truck if it's close enough, and I have! Not to mention, any public event would suddenly be ten times better when I would see that green truck parked nearby.Needless to say, their food is awesome. You can have a classic taco, burrito, or bowl any way you like it - beef, pork, chicken, beans, no beans, rice, hot/medium/mild, or you can try whatever specials they have available on the truck that day. They typically have some pretty awesome sides as well, like mac & cheese or potato salad. And don't get me started on delicious Jarritos!Their tacos are small, but are only around $2 a pop so you should definitely order so, so many tacos. Or you could just fill up on a loaded burrito (my experience of choice). There are 4 trucks that run, and they also have catering cars. They post on their social media accounts daily and do a great job at keeping people up to date on where they will be serving that day!If you're looking to sit down and enjoy your Lloyd, check out the Taco Factory on Hertel (& soon to be on Main in Williamsville!).Day 9"}, {"review_id": "NrkWcNmuPClYd8T7wytIBg", "user_id": "vpSiro5ljB57vuZxE4J7fg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "Yum Yum Yum to my Tum Tum Tummmm!!

Lloyd's is probably one of my least favourite places to eat in the wonderful food mecca of Buffalo. My main 2 problems with it are:(1) I find the food to taste awful. I like real Mexican food, but even this Americanized, bland, Tex-Mex meets Korean-fusion food, can be decent at times (but rarely better). Lloyd's doesn't even taste close to decent in my opinion. (It's also overpriced).(2) It's soooooo insanely overrated. Especially by the growing hipster and millennial culture in Buffalo, which in general has about as much clue about food as, well, I used to when I was a teenager. Which is next to nothing. I can handle people saying this is the best, amazing, etc... just about. I just shake my head. But when they start saying the words authentic and Mexican in relation to this, I get actually annoyed. Just stop. You like a white-owned American taco place which makes cool weird hipster tacos. No problem. You love it. Great. But you do not like a Mexican places and my goodness, you do not like an authentic Mexican place. Cool beans. Literally. Cold really.If you want real (and really good) Mexican food, go to La Divina, go to Valle Of Mexico II, go to Lorenzo's in Albion, Mariachi and Monte Alban (summer only) in Medina. There you have it. 2 reasons I don't give 1 star to these dudes, is that they're pretty friendly (and very rich) guys, and that I have friends that have literally pleased with me to raise my rating. So I'll keep it above a 1 for their sake. It's not above a Juan though. Never that."}, {"review_id": "sWhapXAYLW4Xyk3_UBLu2A", "user_id": "Vbv_6J1A26boaLr9eD7q8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I want to point out that I have not had a negative experience in a very long time. Since Lloyd opened up the restaurant, everything has been much better and more consistent. I do love Lloyd, and enjoy patronizing a local business and people who do their best to make things right (hence their response to me on here). I still get the el camino, but now love the skinny Thai version! I also very much appreciate the vegan option at their ice cream shop next door, and feel like they have made this a priority and listened to their customers :) Thanks, Lloyd!"}, {"review_id": "x86fADjJyLpjbqwHfFH-YQ", "user_id": "MiIhPqbV11A_rmDfCjVL9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "One week ago I tried Lloyd Taco Factory for the first time and it left me craving more and more (and more and more and more) and when I showed up to Barkfest 2017 and saw the Lloyd Taco Truck I immediately got in line for lunch! The menu on the truck is much smaller then in the restaurant (which is expected seeing as how it's a food truck) but still has plenty of great options like tacos, burritos, nachos, and of course the delicious corn. I decided to go with a chicken burrito and let me tell you, it was AMAZING! The chicken inside had so much flavour that it had me practically drooling (practically, i didn't actually drool). Afterwards I ended up getting one of the Aztec Brownie's and even though it wasn't the best brownie I have ever eaten, it sure was good. At the end of the day, if you are at an event with the Lloyd Taco Truck you should probably get in line."}, {"review_id": "xDTJedP03K-l3S70JnoRLQ", "user_id": "blMIJM3CGThhg0VwzPwalA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/22/2017", "text": "Let me just say that there is something quintessentially Buffalonian about going to the Lloyds truck, either in sweltering heat or blistering cold, because you're on a taco hunt. That feeling huddling next to the order window in hopes of some radiant heat, or staying well away to keep cool. That moment of ecstasy when your name gets called and you pick up your order, and that moment when you ALMOST forget to squeeze lime all over your tacos. Some people might scoff at the idea of food off a truck, but I would argue that the hunt makes the food all the more delicious (especially if eaten sitting in the grass)."}, {"review_id": "V50WDHAuptPxz23g1STc4Q", "user_id": "4qJJpg7TU6CfJsHdNapW5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2017", "text": "Wow - so good!

Now I love reuben and the thought of a bite size version was one I knew that couldn't be passed up.Two for $3.90, and I'll just let my picture do the talking.

Love that they pioneered the whole food truck thing and are making such a statement in Buffalo. For that, they earn some stars. Unfortunately, the food just misses the mark. Haven't gotten Lloyd in years because I felt their quality had declined but decided to get it last night at FTT when I noticed the line wasn't outrageous. The line moved pretty quickly and staff were friendly. I decided to get the braised beef tacos while my friend got a burrito. Broken phone = the worst quality pictures :(  In my opinion, if you get the meat and the tortilla right, then you can't go wrong and unfortunately, neither satisfied me. The meat was desperate for some salt or just more flavor in general. And the homemade tortillas? Sorry, just not a fan. They fall apart easily and the texture is a little off. La Divina's or Casa Azul's homemade tortillas are an much better in my opinion. Either way, I honestly thought the store bought tortillas they used to use were better. Eeek did I just say that? Also, the owner's responses to reviews are making my laugh. \"Sorry, you think we're terrible but we make all natural, homemade tortillas\". While I am a huge proponent of making things from scratch if you are a food business, quality/flavor should always be more important. People don't care what you made form scratch or how you made it if they don't enjoy the food. So all in all, I respect what they do and what they have done for the city but there are definitely better tacos and better food trucks."}, {"review_id": "d2Liptf893V3vgFbvwg7aA", "user_id": "L0JhshETScQqVieT3nGcMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "They come to my office building every Thursday and I look forward to a Lloyd lunch more than I should!

Since I was sober while ordering yesterday, I remember the entire experience.First of all, I like their menu better than the one at their brick and mortar location. It's simpler and therefore more delicious to me. I prefer rustic when it comes to Mexican food. I was at the Holistic Health Fair for my invisible illness game night group and saw that Lloyd's was there. I hadn't eaten yet so I figured it was a good idea to stuff my face right then. When I got to their truck, a smiling face greeted me and she gladly answered my questions. I got the fully loaded nachos with chicken and a guava soda, which is something that exists. As I was chatting to the workers (I was the only one in line), I mentioned that I preferred their food to the poutine at the truck next to them, even though everything was gluten free there. When one of the cooks ascertained that I couldn't have much gluten, his eyes widened with worry. He explained the the queso on the nachos had some flour in it and offered to make something with no gluten...at no extra charge. I thought that was great of him, but decided that since it was only a little flour and I don't have celiac disease that I would stick with my order.The food was so good! The soda was interesting too. My vote is that I liked it. The nachos were crisp and so ooey gooey with queso and chicken.

I love Lloyd and have been going with my sister in Buffalo for years, as well as with my whole family when they come up to visit. However, whenever I simply ask for no crema sauce or no queso on my tricked of nachos, it is always a problem. Today, I ordered tricked out nachos to go. I watched as the worker put the crema sauce on my nachos, saw him read the ticket and realize it said no crema, so he threw the nachos out and started over. Seeing this happen, I thought it was safe to assume my nachos were dairy free this time. However, once I got home and opened up the box I realized there was queso all over my nachos. I really think this is just inexcusable as it happens every time and I spent $10 on food for lunch that I cannot eat. I don't have time to go back and ask for different ones, I waited 20 minutes for my food and went out of my way to drive to Lloyd today. I cannot eat dairy so it is very disappointing and upsetting that I went out of my way and paid for food that I cannot eat.
