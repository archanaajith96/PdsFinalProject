I am glad we took the time to go, because the food is AMAZING! It is incredibly unique in how you eat at this diner. You sit at a table for ten surrounded by people you do not know. The best part is NO CELL PHONES ALLOWED !!! Which means you have to do something I feel a lot of people have lost touch in, and that is to interact with REAL HUMANS! The menu changes every night from what I heard, we only were able to go once - and it was all amazing (southern comfort) soul food !I highly recommend this place, and if I ever visit Nashville again - I will not be leaving without dining here."}, {"review_id": "PjAIEfBEAah03UNiAtw8EQ", "user_id": "m1IHjinBULNRKLPxFfoGiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Monell's is insane. We decided to come here on a whim one Sunday and ended up having one of the best meals of our whole dang careers. There's a different menu every day, but everything is served family style. Tables are filled by the 10's, so if you come with less than that you'll be eating with some strangers. Nevertheless, it wasn't strange at all. Its a little bit pricey, but for the quality and variety of the food, Monell's is totally worth it. It's also beautiful. 5/5 easyDefinitely pace yourself, if your table finishes all the food you're all champions."}, {"review_id": "wnJ-F3hrmO6sG-ccFUgKiQ", "user_id": "NCjQXZnTwxsLYZR-12uUzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "We decided to come here on our Nashville trip. I was hesitant about having to eat at a table with strangers, but it wasn't so bad. I was expecting to have to wait but we were seated right away. Food was brought out to the table and you eat family style. Some items like the chicken went fast and we had to wait till the next round to get some. The chicken was pretty good, it was crispy and had good flavor. Some items got cold quickly and you have to hope someone else eats it so they can bring out a refill one that's hot. The food was good but nothing that really wowed me. It was a neat and different experience though and I'm glad we went. The garden outside here is beautiful. The hostess was very friendly and offered to take our picture when he saw us trying to take selfies."}, {"review_id": "khAcIp1olr0TDhW9evI0XQ", "user_id": "7YXyAvDu_LGGwUVkh0QHIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Have you EVER seen a place with this many AMAZING reviews? It went on the list of must go places because of the great reviews. It lived up to all the expectations- I HIGHLY recommended going to Monell's when in Nashville! It's family style. This means you get to eat with other people, interact with other people, and share a meal with people you've never met before. I think more restaurants need to have \"family style\". They have rules posted outside (one of them is no cells phones) which I love because then people are actually interacting with one another, and listening. It's a pretty amazing concept. The food just keeps on flowing. Dish after dish after dish. Take what you want - no more then what you will eat, and pass it to your neighbor. Everything was delicious. They put out quality, hot, delicious food family style, something I have never seen before."}, {"review_id": "pyJu8tAIl5N4h2HjuONeDA", "user_id": "lHADMia6cC01NCu0p_ztfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Family style dining.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I had the best time at Monell's! As I was leaving Knoxville, I wanted to try an establishment that I have not been to before and boy wasn't I in for a treat! When I arrived, I was confused because they sat me at a table with other people I didn't know and the other guest began to offer me food. Although it was a kind gesture, I told them \"no thank you, I will wait until our menus come...haha, that never happened. The food at the table is for the guest to all share. It's sort of like a sit down buffet. They food kept flowing as well as the conversations and a good time. The decor and set up reminds me of a scene from the 1940's. They encourage guest not to use cell phones. The goal is to enjoy the moment, the food, and the experience! I instantly fell in love. I am now a fan!"}, {"review_id": "0WB0QKv54MIJ_8ttAgqC7A", "user_id": "wZoN9kxux4qefxbcd1EWJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Our Uber driver suggested this restaurant, so of course I yelped it and was intrigued.

This is a family style restaurant, meaning you come in and get seated at a large table of about 15 people.  So depending on how many people you have with you, there's a good chance that you will not know half the people at your table.  Get ready to know them because once the food comes, they will be passing the plates to you and vice versa.  You will be sharing the dishes a la family style with the people at your table.The food is soooo good.  Imagine some good ole Southern cooking - fried chicken, mashed potatoes,  slaw, pot roast, with some iced tea and lemonade to wash it all down with.  You don't get to pick out your menu as it is already premade for that day.  I'm sure their website posts whatever the menu would be for that day.The price is really good for an all you can eat family style set up.  Eat all that your heart desires!  The service is really good, they make sure that everyone is satisfied and had plenty to eat!Make sure you put your phones away and check your social media accounts beforehand as cell phones are only allowed for pictures.  This is so that you're not rude around your \"new\" family and miss out on the whole experience.  This restaurant is definitely one that everyone needs to experience!The only downside that I found is for picky eaters like my 7 year old.  I wish they had a kids menu to choose from in the event that they don't like the menu for the day.  Thank goodness fried chicken is part of their every day menu as my daughter loved it."}, {"review_id": "MFgH2N7EzL842rg-rldD3Q", "user_id": "DUrsS30l9H6tIcmU9s00ug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "My gf and I came to Nashville for a long weekend to see the Titans play on Monday night.

I mean,the food is perfect for it, don't get me wrong. But you sit at a big table, mostly full of God fearing people, and you have to gather any bit of energy you have to engage in thoughtful conversation with complete strangers.This was rough. Real rough.Learn from my experience, kiddos.That being said, everything at Monell's is great. You are served in a huge group family style and the food is bountiful beyond belief. There was so much food, we didn't even make a dent in some dishes! At a table of ten! It's hard to even mention highlights because seriously everything was so gosh darn good. Some of the items they had were: Smoked Sausage, Bacon, Biscuits and Gravy, Country Ham, Fried Apples, Pancakes, Scrambled Eggs, Hash Browns, Cheese Grits, Skillet Fried Chicken, Corn (my fav like a creamed corn), coffee, tea.....so many things! You can eat as fast or as slow as you like, but it's kind of awkward getting up from the big group. All in all, now knowing exactly how it is at Monell's, I'd def go back.

Accurate. We were actually referred to Monell's by our Uber driver who has lived in Nashville her whole life. We stopped in on Friday night and were seated immediately. Keep in mind it's family style so if you are in a small group, you'll be seated with other people at a large, family table and everyone will pass the food around as it comes out. I LOVE this concept and it was SO southern I just ate it right up (in more ways than one). We met some really great people during our dinner!Ok for the food. Y'all. Yum. I honestly ate every single thing that was brought out and then had seconds of the shells and the peach cobbler and am not ashamed in the slightest. Where do I start? The chicken, ribs, shells and sauce, biscuits, corn bread, preserves....the list goes on. It was all INCREDIBLE. The waiters and waitresses checked on us quite often and were SO hospitable I could have just stayed there hanging out with all these great people between our table and the staff!Great concept, amazing food, even better people!

Yelp led us to Monell's and all I can say is thank you, thank you, thank you. My southern food dreams were realized.Dinner at Monell's was actually the first meal we had in Nashville and it set the bar high! It was a Thursday night and we didn't have to wait at all to be seated. In fact, we were seated so fast I think I was handed a biscuit before I even had my coat off! And from there the food bonanza began! SO. MUCH. FOOD!It was like a fantasy parade of southern delights - biscuits with peach preserves, cornbread, fried chicken, pork chops, peas, corn pudding, black eyed peas, green beans, mac and cheese - the list goes on. Seriously, every bite was a good as the last. I wanted to just keep eating and eating. I did have to do seconds on that chicken - amazing. Then for dessert we had banana pudding. The guy next to me was super excited and really hyped it up. He was right - it was great too! Pretty sure Monell's doesn't do anything that's bad.I wasn't sure how the family style seating would go but it was just fine. Everyone was pleasant and it was mostly small talk but it added a unique element to the experience. I have to confess that we like Monell's so much, we went back for lunch two days later. It was just as good the second time around! If you're in Nashville, Monell's is a MUST!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/monells-dining-and-catering-nashville?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
