The fact one is opened within walking distance of me is REALLY exciting and I foresee myself being there multiple times a week--and I'm ok with that because you can make it healthy. For starters, it is set up kind of like the Chipotle-style of serving. You walk in (well, a lot times you wait in a long line--but it's worth the wait) and choose your bowl. They have various options, depending on how many items you want. Some of my favorite options are the sweet potato noodles (a must-get!!); broccoli; grilled and baked chicken; veggie quinoa; black bean corn salsa; and the balsamic sauce. My only complaint with this place is that the quantity of food is inconsistent. One visit, the kids bowl I often get is so full I have leftovers...the next, it's scarce. It just depends on who is working. While I often get to-go, they do have a cute seating area at both locations. Overall, though, this is a staple for me and I don't hesitate to recommend giving it a try!"}, {"review_id": "Ym1aDcP2ZiVFM-Ui2O6jSA", "user_id": "9ojwk9XWxWDRSeBRxjk_sw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "The almond chicken here is SO AMAZING. I'm not gluten-free, and I still loved these chicken tenders. This is the perfect place to pick up healthy lunch options, desserts, and pressed juices. I love that they roast their vegetables and have really yummy dairy-free sauces that they make in-house. You watch them build your bowl (like they do at Chipotle), so the line moves pretty fast. Which is a good thing cause it's usually pretty packed and it's a small building with really limited seating. So getting food to-go is your best bet!I got the kids bowl (1 base, 1 veg, 1 protein, 1 sauce) and it filled me up. Which makes it pretty affordable for healthy food! This is basically a meal-prep lovers dream, because it takes healthy meal prep-type meals to another level. If I worked in Tampa, I would eat here all the time!"}, {"review_id": "uVZOUxm76HE4_h0GUTpFEw", "user_id": "4xcjS_64MEHfO4sngneFEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "My favorite place in Tampa for healthy fast food! Seriously, I always come to Fresh Kitchen when I don't feel like cooking but also don't want to feel bad about myself. Fresh Kitchen is located on Howard and they recently opened a new location on Kennedy. Parking here is limited, but they do open the nearby business parking lot during dinner time which really helps.When you walk in, Fresh Kitchen reminds you of Chipotle. You go through an assembly line and pick what you want in your bowl. You can choose either a 4 bowl or a 6 bowl. I can barely finish the 6, so I usually opt for the 4. My go-to's are the kale salad, sweet potato noodles, mushrooms, steak, or the citrus chicken. For sauces I usually go with the cucumber jalapeno or creamy white ginger. The prices are very fair for fresh, fast food.They also sell a variety of fresh juices and immune shots if you're interested. They're a little pricey, but it's nice to have those options available."}, {"review_id": "nV6Buv-MVZHmWH221t3BrA", "user_id": "muvuCp-PjnyyBAJZNFG2lg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Calling all military personnel, they give you discount for your  food here.  Fresh cooked all the time and prepared to the utmost freshness of ingredients they use.  Come and try and you won't be disappointed!  Having said that, make ample time for your lunch here as it's a long line when it's past 12:30ish but the line is so fast so don't be alarmed just get in line."}, {"review_id": "INGs3NSIE2WD0Z2129SmNw", "user_id": "VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Oh...oh this is dangerous.  Truly healthy, fast, affordable, and delicious.  It's a QUADRUPLE threat, people! Visited on 3/30/18 at 6PM.  $21.11 got us an entree bowl, a bottle of water, a bottle of juice, and a package of cookies.  The restaurant is set up like Chipotle with a counter and assembly line behind it.  You pick what you want, pay, and then sit down and eat.  The restaurant is ridiculously cute with it's tiled floors, pink rose-laden table tops, and aqua 1950's chairs.   I got the $8.29 \"four\" bowl which is supposed to come with 2 bases, one veggie, one protein, and one sauce.  I opted for the quinoa and kale salad for my bases, the broccoli for my veggie, and green beans instead of a protein.  I didn't try any of the sauces but I will next time.  The kale was cut finely and very tender and laced with nice little pieces of purple cabbage.  The quinoa was cooked perfectly and full of little chunks of fresh peppers.  The green beans were seasoned perfectly and the broccoli was absolutely heavenly....a little smokey and sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  Very rarely do healthy and tasty meet in the same place...but they do here.  Everything was scrumptious! I picked up a little box of chocolate chip cookies for $4 and it said they were paleo...made of almond flour, olive oil, agar powder, eggs, honey, and dairy free chocolate chips and I thought to myself \"these are probaby gonna taste like dog crap\" but OHHHHH MAHHHH GAWD....delicious!  Chewy, decadent, not too sweet, rich but not overpowering.  One of the best things I've ever eaten.  Sign me up for the paleo diet if that's part of it LMAO  My kiddo got a \"sweet berry tea\" cold pressed juice which had strawberries, oolong tea, and maple.  I didn't even get a chance to try it before he gulped it down.  If a picky 3 year old drinks it you know it's gotta be good.  It's gonna be a struggle not to come here every day, honestly.  I'm really glad it's not closer to my house."}, {"review_id": "2Mx8wwlBY9DBEScdVQBJlQ", "user_id": "ZxV0GKK5L_MIE8qWD-b21w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "First off, SO fast.

The $9.99 Six can last two meals easily! They offer tofu as a protein for vegans, but I wish they would add other options as well. The vegetables are SO good! Especially the roasted sweet potatoes and green beans. I can go on and on. The items on the menu are clearly marked as vegan or not, and you have the option of adding broth to your meal to make it a nice soup! Pssst.... got a hangover? There are several different homemade drinks they offer, as well as they bottle their own water. Definitely check this place out, you won't regret it.

FK was amazing. I stopped in while on a business trip in Tampa not just once but two days in a row and would have been there daily for this business trip had it been longer. I really wish we had a place like this in the Indianapolis area. Attention FK - open in Indy and you'll be sure to have lines out the door like FK Tampa has every day. The line out the door alone should tell anyone reading the Yelp reviews that FK is legit. On my first visit I did the 6 bowl with sweet potato glass noodles, coconut rice, baked coconut chicken, bbq chicken, roasted sweet potatoes, roasted mushrooms, tomatoes, sriracha sauce and avocado. Wow what a bowl! The flavors all just meld together perfectly. It ended up being about a $15 bowl but was well worth it as the taste is just awesome and is a pretty healthy dinner overall. For my second visit I just slightly changed it to sub the mashed cauliflower for the sweet potato glass noodles and tried the teriyaki chicken instead. The mashed cauliflower was the only item I was just meh on out of both bowls. The line and parking were crazy both times I went but not unbearable by any means. The line actually moves very quick and you can find street parking or parking in their lot pretty easily. Get there a little early and you are golden.

I was amazed at how good it was. The chicken was juicy, again flavors on point. All of that mixed together getting that perfect bite, again and again...man...it was sooo good. I washed it all down with the unsweetened strawberry kiwi tea, which to unsweetened had a ton of fruity flavor. I didn't miss the sugar at all. Prices were good, considering this is quality food.

Some ingredients may cost extra, but the ones included in the price are all tasty. You just walk down the line and choose what you want to eat; super simple!!- From The Bases you can choose from include: brown rice, coconut ginger rice, romaine salad, cauliflower potato mash, kale slaw, vegetable quinoa, sweet potato noodles- From The Veggies: parmesan broccoli, roasted mushrooms, sesame green beans, roasted brussel sprouts, roasted sweet potatoes, braised kale and beans- And The Proteins include: grilled citrus chicken, herb grilled steak, baked almond chicken, chia seed tuna poke, bbq chicken, chia seed teriyaki tofu- Top your food off with these Sauces: creamy white ginger, coconut sriracha, herb balsamic vinaigrette, cucumber jalapeño, holy kaleI ordered a six bowl, which includes 2 Bases + 2 Veggies + 2 Proteins + 1 Sauce. I loved the sweet potato noodles, I definitely recommend that for one of your bases. I got the roasted brussel sprouts, the braised kale and beans, and chose the herb grilled steak for my protein.  I really liked the steak; it was cooked tender and not over done. My cousin likes to get the bbq chicken, and I tried our friend's grilled citrus chicken but I thought it was kind of dry. I got the herb balsamic vinaigrette for my sauce.  Everything was DELICIOUS!! They also have fresh juices in the bottle but I grabbed a Cafe Moo Free, which is their Cold Brew coffee made with almonds, H2O, maple, cinnamon, vanilla, and sea salt. It was not too tart but refreshing.  One of the better cold brews that I've ever had.I LOVED my food at Fresh Kitchen, I do suggest trying their food if you're in the area!!"}, {"review_id": "4WNnDfcfjCAKzJhUI-bDXw", "user_id": "JyzLjUFEIW3epNlHI6Oa6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "I love a place where you can get a good portion and not feel guilty about what you're eating.  The options at Fresh Kitchen are diverse and can suit all tastes, even if you're not into a totally healthy food mindset.  The bowls where you can pick a couple of bases from rice to sweet potato noodles are my usual go to and you can select one or two proteins depending on what you choose from the menu.  I love their mushrooms and the cucumber/jalapeno sauce to accompany any bowl I choose to get.  I'm so glad that this concept is catching on and adding locations throughout Tampa.  It makes eating out guilt free."}, {"review_id": "sjsQsmkWJLMCbx2GPIf2sg", "user_id": "E96vQnptExiA7iEDCyuH3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "I absolutely love fresh kitchen and I wish I could eat here more often.
