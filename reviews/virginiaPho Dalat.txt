Great big fresh vegetables that made me feel healthy again. lol I walked in with the intention of grabbing something and heading out with it but the sweet older man seating people looked at me puzzled and said sit. I'm glad I did the casual atmosphere was just what i needed to unwind. That definitely know what they are doing when it comes to their broth!  WOW. I'm so glad this was on my way to my meeting. I will be bringing my daughter soon she loves Pho.

Being from California where Vietnamese food is everywhere, we had a hard time finding a quality Pho place in Virginia. The service has definitely gotten better since the servers changed, there was a young male server that stayed on his phone all the time and you had to literally get up to receive service. Now the older gentlemen and the young lady are great!!I have seen that they are getting extremely busy!! Which is a great thing! We always order 2 orders of their egg rolls... AMAZING... and my husband always orders the number 9. I always order the roasted pork and rice meal... AMAZING. We heard that their wings are amazing, we are going to try them next time around"}, {"review_id": "rTvyf7Sk__bcuh1UxC7n8g", "user_id": "oIDCc10FJFNaZm586I_Wdw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I ordered the #9 \"Special pho\", and spring rolls for pick up. When it was time to pay I questioned the price as it sounded a bit high for what I ordered, the man who was ringing me up said it was $4.25 for spring rolls and $13.99 for the pho. After asking once I did not question the price again, then I got home and saw on the menu they put in my bag the #9 pho special should've only been $10.99. I understand it's only 3 dollars difference but in this instance I think principle should be considered over dollar amounts. The food was great but I don't think anyone likes being overcharged."}, {"review_id": "cZ6Wi9K7ygKH2pv9-b8pQg", "user_id": "tofM7Z-nY35QmyyyQJ7IFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "Our experience here was a great one as we decided to get a nice and hot bowl of soup on a chilly fall night. We were in the area so we chose this Vietnamese restaurant to eat in. It has a family owned feel as well. Good choice!We entered Pho Dalat and we were seated right away. The menu had pictures of each entree and item which is actually pretty smart for people who like to visualize what they are ordering. It also helps people new to Vietnamese cuisine as to what they are ordering. We both got the Beef pho and it came out fairly quick. The flavor of the pho broth was delicious and there was plenty servings of beef. The bowl seems small at first but as you keep eating, it turns out to be a pretty good amount of soup and noodles. Very satisfying! The service was minimal as we didn't get water refills but it wasn't a problem. They have complimentary oranges at the end of your meal as a light and refreshing dessert. Solid place to get pho!"}, {"review_id": "5yBWj_DWHeDANkW9vUFFlQ", "user_id": "KX605-3AAeQeeioSXNOrSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "What a joyful visit. !The Menu is simple , fun and accurate.The Pho..

It was clean and service was quick, but we also ate around ~11 to skip the lunch rush (and partially because it was my meeting day, so I had little room and time to grab some pho with my friends). The spring rolls were crunchy and incredibly delicious. I loved the fish sauce even though the scent was so strong everyone at worked wondered what I ate for lunch. Whatever! You guys are missing out~ #NoShame The broth is no joke. It was so flavorful. I was craving because I haven't had pho in a long time, and I heard about this place from friends. My noodles were tasty. The beef was tender. I dumped all my bean sprouts in my soup and ended up prioritizing those over my noodles. I squeezed some lime in but opted to dodge the sriracha because of the canker sore that day, lol. We all slurped our orders merrily while my 2 friends went Naruto style and drank out of their bowls. Forget other pho places in Chesapeake. I've been converted to this one now! I'll be in a little more often once the weather gets colder forsure; however, I might opt to get it to go since my coworkers complained about the smell lol. Oh well, the joys of pho though~"}, {"review_id": "Jnem7q6qm4o0D8O7ud-Kow", "user_id": "0h9PCdkvW6QILeJwyQrvqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "I ordered a beef pho and they served it within 5min.

Having dined here recently, I cannot understand why I have not returned sooner. My go-to Vietnamese dish is the vermicelli with pork. There is something in their marinade because it is ADDICTING! It is a perfect blend of savory with a hint of sweet that is not overwhelming. Probably the best vietnamese pork I've had! My husband got the pork chop dinner and he inhaled it - that's how good it was. We've also had their pho but they do not add tripe which is one of our favorite  ingredients. Their broth is good but without the tripe, we go elsewhere for pho. They've also cleaned up their restaurant and added more seating.  Don't expect much of the service. You don't come here to be catered to. You come here for delicious vietnamese food.

I love to come here for this dish in particular. They are known for the pho here but seriously. I love the egg noodles with the fatty cuts of duck! They used to have their restaurant at the food court at Lynnhaven mall. But they've since moved to this location. They are located beside cold stone creamery off Volvo parkway. Across from greenbrier mall. The auntie and family that works here is really nice. It's a family owned business, and I love coming here for the soups!They don't cheapen the food with tiny portions. The spring rolls here are stuffed and much larger than what is offered to me in some Vietnamese restaurants in the Hampton roads area.I've tried the pho. My husband usually gets the combination pho here. but the duck noodle soup is packed with flavor. I love the broth! It's more richer in flavor. They include green vegetables carrot slices, juicy duck, green onions complimented with the bean sprouts, jalapeño and seasoning dipping sauce to eat with the duck. After they leave me with orange slices to clean my pallet. Try the chicken wings, spring roll, egg roll and soups here... it's their specialty. I love coming here any day of the week. They don't get over crowded and it is best to have hot soup on a chilly day. The place can be a little more updated. It's not modern, very Asian, and simply decorated. But u can't go wrong eating here. It's also inexpensive."}, {"review_id": "eBdqOH_5GSNyZPr-mD7A8Q", "user_id": "USzkpdPgegRnX9mpMHugmQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/10/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Today was not the day. It was pretty busy when we strolled in. So my group all ordered PHO with 2 orders of Goi Cuon (Soft spring rolls). We received our Pho, but still didn't  receive our waters. I had to ask for our waters then I realized we never received our Goi Cuon. I assumed they forgot. Didn't worry about it. Waiter never came to check on us and we never got any napkins. So I went to the register to ask for some napkins and he only handed me 3 napkins, which was not even enough for my table of 4. He didn't even apologize for the bad service. After eating our OVERPRICED pho, I went up to pay and mentioned I never received our 2 orders of Goi Cuon, he looked at me as if I was lying and looked over to check on the table if it did come. Seriously!? The food is good and overpriced but the main thing is the customer service definitely needs some work. Look through my previous reviews. Over the past couple years it has gotten worse. Definitely not good."}, {"review_id": "EwGwWAvrWYe3-3qqVLRoMQ", "user_id": "ZPC7F7u250Nij6WGxeQpjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "The atmosphere and staff  are warm and inviting.

However, I was very dissatisfied with my last visit due to the food and service. Our server came over to ask what we wanted and we told them we would like water for our drink. He looked at us and said \"okay?\" And continued to ask what we wanted for food. After we ordered our food, we asked to keep one menu because we were planning to order something to go. He said \"no you already ordered\" and we were like \"uhh, but we want to order something to go later\" and he said \"tell me later, I'll give you a menu later\" I really thought he came off extremely rude and we did not order to go after this. The food was good, but the service made the food just not enjoyable as it could have been. I also personally like to add fish sauce to my pho, but when I asked the guy who brought out the pho, he could not understand me. He was very nice and tried, which I truly appreciate, but he brought out the wrong sauce and I gave up. Overall, the food is great, but an overall good dining experience needs great service and this is what I feel lacked."}, {"review_id": "jLHACuceV7u6uaElw-iRFA", "user_id": "_H7ufCd9m1e_zHUiE6E5GA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "My wife and I decided to try something different one day.
