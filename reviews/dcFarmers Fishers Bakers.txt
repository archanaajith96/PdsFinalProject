We started with the hot crab and artichoke dip, which was delicious. I ordered the shrimp scampi and was not disappointed - the gnocchi was soooo good. Finished off with the chocolate cake, which was very rich but worth it. Definitely get a reservation, we went on a monday evening and it was still packed.

We got the Manhattan red pot. They were small but not bad. We also got the crab artichoke dish which, despite the waiters saying, was cheese and mayo heavy. They both also came with a lot of bread which was good but too much. We left feeling full but not sick...until about an hour later. My boyfriend and I felt really nauseous from something we ate (probably mussels broth or the dip we assumed). But never felt like that after a meal before... hence the 2 stars. Drinks: we got espresso martinis which were BERY HONESTLY THE WORST IVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Not just counting espresso martinis but every drink I've ever ordered. It was worse than chugging Smirnoff at a frat party. We couldn't even get past the first sip but each was still $13. Honestly, we should have just sent them back but neither of us had had an experience THAT bad before. Service: The service was a little slow especially at the front desk but our waiter was nice.

I would have really enjoyed our experience here, but there were a few things preventing it from being 5 Star. For one, we had a reservation for a party of 6 at 7:30 on a Monday night. We still had to wait for 35 minutes though. There were plenty of open tables, but no one to bus them. There's really nowhere to wait either. The waiting area in the front is PACKED allowing room for only 3 people. Then, the device continued to be extremely slow all night. We were there for over 2 hours and we were also stuffed into a booth that whole time. The food was pretty good. And, they had a great wine and cocktail selection. But, the service aspects were the primary problem, failing to truly allow us to enjoy our experience."}, {"review_id": "cz7dEw1ztk0JDy1YMisJnA", "user_id": "-bqc0DAjHaIYaejWa8AHng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Just like its sister establishments, this place hits the spot for a satisfying and comforting meal. It's also perfect for an al fresco dinner by the waterfront!RUNDOWN:- American comfort food done right! And this restaurant in particular has tacos and sushi as well, unlike its counterparts (Founding Farmers, Farmers & Distillers)- Food, without a doubt, is delicious. They do it right every time from their salads and burgers to their risotto and seafood, you can't go wrong! And the best part is how reasonable their prices are for being in Georgetown. - Tableside guac wasn't made tableside :( Maybe because I was seated outdoors? - Service is also super! I chose to sit outside and it got a little chilly towards the evening, and I asked if they could turn on the one heat lamp by our table and they gladly did so! All the waiters clearly know the menu and are very welcoming. TIPS/RECS:- You REALLY need reservations for a place like this because it's packed ALL the time (unless you get lucky!), or you can make reservations when you get there and walk around the waterfront to kill time!-- FRIED WHITE FISH TACOS-- ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUT PIZZA-- CREAMY MUSHROOM MUSSEL POT-- CRUNCHY TUNA ROLLTLDR; Great food at reasonable prices in a prime location!"}, {"review_id": "bYKb0zSwoAlexbnBIJWBUQ", "user_id": "yWN1ODTBkPNvvLsXxpOZLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "What a bizarre place. I mean bizarre in a good way, too. I was definitely in the stage between lunch and dinner - where you missed lunch, had a late breakfast but couldn't wait until dinner. We toured some areas of DC and caught an Uber over to the restaurant. Be careful in making an online reservation as it leads you to believe there's only one location in DC, when there are two very close to each other. Had a little squabble but this location ended up honoring our reservation and we were sat immediately. We sat down in a spacious booth right near the bar and saw all these large, bucket style drinks being served. Our waitress helped us out in choosing the right one. Phew! Luckily, we had Bavarian pretzels to soak all that up. They came with Sour Cream and Chive dip, honey mustard bbq dip, and pimento cheese spread - all three of those options were really good. Id say Pimento was my favorite. Im not going to lie, it was hard to navigate the menu - for once. I just kept wanting to bounce back from all the different options. I couldn't just focus on picking on e area and reading those options then moving one. But hey, it could've been the Mai Tai. Or the view. I finally selected the Fried Fish Sampler with scallops, shrimp and white fish. It was really good with the tartar sauce they served but I honestly couldn't finish half of it. It was so large. You never realize how much you can take until you actually do it. Then you're all filled up. Moving on to my usual favorite part - dessert. I was in a pinch here because i was stuck between my two faves: Boston creme or bananas foster. The waitress was very strong to suggest the Bananas, which was fine by me. It came out on a really cool pewter style bowl apparatus. Again, it was so filling. It literally got all over my hands and face. What a mess. But, it was so good. I couldn't help myself. The manager came out to check on us and stated she was comping out dessert for being so patient in the wait time for our food, but I'm not really sure that we waited that long for anything. So, by their standards, maybe we did. for her to be on the ball like that and in communication with the wait staff was an A+. Next time, sit outside."}, {"review_id": "_oxyWdJlSTYTJU3zWAqStg", "user_id": "IrxksmWRD9rRivs7JE6IKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Was in town for some athletic contests and sightseeing and on a late Saturday afternoon, found ourselves in need of some nourishment. While checking in on FDR, she found this spot somewhat close and with the reviews and location- decided to give it a try. Grabbed an Uber and headed over- made reservations via website. Like a moron, I decided to select THE WRONG LOCATION of this place. So we showed up- without a reservation, and realized it as we approached the hostess nest. Woman checked for our reservation, realized what we did, and sat us anyway. No fuss, no attitude, no \"I'm doing you a big favor here\"- just sat us. Not sure if reservations were even needed at this time, but that was a big plus for me as a fan of customer service. Sat over near the bar. This is an odd type place- quirky decor, like a farm to table but with an edge type feel. There were shovels with trees as handles, odd bathroom decor (men I'll let you experience it), and use of out of ordinary color paint. I appreciated it. Better than boring. We order an appetizer (pretzels with sauces) and a couple of entrees. The appetizer was VERY good. Came with pimento cheese, French onion dip, and a spicy mustard type sauce. You get 3, but they are about 2 feet long. Had a good time talking about the sauces, pulling apart and sharing. For the entree, I went with the crab cake sandwich- equipped with fries. It was topped with a type of slaw and on a non-traditional type of potato bun. Fries reminded me of the kind you would get at a beach boardwalk stand, and had a tomato mustard seed smear on the plate. Our waitress was very nice, continually filling our water glasses, dealing with my spewage and taking my one liners in stride. Very nice and punctual waitress that gave us ideas, pointed out things and explained menu. Not to be denied, we went with bananas foster for dessert. ***Here's where things got interesting.***A manager brought it out and said our waitress said we were a great table and were patient with things coming out slow. For that she was comping our dessert (it was free). #1 I didn't feel like things were slow and #2 that's huge. The dessert was great- vanilla ice cream and dumped with the foster concoction on top. Very messy and sloppy. But I tasted so sweet. And when you watch it run down the sides you just go back in for more. Well done.So to wrap it up: great customer service, great waitress, and management that cares and goes up and beyond."}, {"review_id": "Hm0T1f9RQGGH1e1-3zsCrA", "user_id": "tZ5U0noloIyw_1I0m5qAfw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "My wife and I invited another couple new to DC to have brunch at this restaurant based on recommendation from a cousin.  I drove up and down the street for 10 minutes looking for street parking to no avail  before parking in the garage at a cost of $13 for the couple of hours we were there.  My wife had attempted a reservation with the restaurant in advance but they were booked less outside seating.  We ended up sitting outside under heat lamps and canopy which was comfortable until it started to drizzle and we had to shift...not a big deal though.  The brunch buffet was very pricey at $32/person but the coffee was good.  The buffet was on the small side in my opinion with an assortment of meat, noodles, desserts, and dishes without names I couldn't discern.  I was disappointed they didn't have placards to identify dishes but my wife said there were reps there to tell people the names.  I wasn't privy to these people I guess and why would I want them to tell me the names of everything when I can read it?  That just creates a line in an already compact area.  I don't eat fish/seafood so this was problematic for me as I tried to determine what I could eat.  I tend to judge a buffet by the amount of times people go back for more...we all had one plate of entrees, and another for dessert.  My wife and friends (would they really tell me the truth?) thought it was a great meal but I thought it was ok.  Ok, in addition to previous comments, because it was a brunch and I do enjoy breakfast items with my brunch.  I saw scrambled eggs in a bowl...not freshly made or an omelet to order as you might expect for $32.  No bacon, no sausage, no danishes, no fruit...I was like you have to be kidding me...no fruit?  They had good french toast with all of the accessories that could be added.  I enjoyed the canadian bacon and tasty beef they carved.Service was great.  The servers were very nice, kept the glasses filled, were responsive, kept the table clean, etc.  It's in a great area overlooking the river and the fountain.Given the overall cost to include parking, and food selection, I think we would try other options before returning."}, {"review_id": "YM-fHDow7M6VqoMSUZYh0A", "user_id": "DFRxNbjEtWb_F5GWxMVNhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Lunch review--Great food, great service, great ambiance! I came here on a Wednesday afternoon for a lunch date with my Mom who was visiting from out of town and we had a lovely time! I made a reservation through the Open Table app for 1pm but we got there about 20 minutes early. It was pretty busy around that time but we still only had to wait about 5 minutes. I'll start off by saying that this place is in a great location adjacent to the Georgetown waterfront. It's also well decorated on the inside-- I like how it feels upscale and clean but also trendy and casual. They also have a great patio out front where you can sit when it's nice out!For food we ordered the hot crab dip to start which was AMAZING. Ordering this is a must. My Mom and I ate almost the whole thing between the 2 of us and were so full from that we barely made a dent in our entrees! We ordered the prosciutto honey fig pizza and the fried brussels sprouts salad with chicken. The pizza was a delicious blend of sweet and savory (it was also huge) and the salad was very refreshing (and the fried brussels sprouts were awesome!). To top it all off our server was extremely friendly and attentive! I was so glad to be able to show my Mom some of the best food that DC has to offer.

It was around 8:45pm so we asked for everything to come out as soon as it was ready. I know it was busy but the food took forever (nearly an hour additional.) even the couple, who sat down long after us, received their food first. The salad and crab dip came out first. The dip was very well done/ borderline burnt, but we were so starving we ate it. The burger came out about 15 mins after.

Our whole experience here was absolutely outstanding.We're from out-of-state and visited FFB during DC's March snowstorm. Despite the snow, the place was still surprisingly crowded. (Side note, be sure to make a reservation! If we hadn't had one, I'm sure we would have been faced with a lengthy wait time.)Atmosphere: As mentioned before, this place is busy. It's still easy to converse with others at your table, but the vibe is a little chaotic.Service: Fantastic! We were seated very quickly after checking in. When we told the waiter that we were first-timers, he gave us a detailed rundown of the restaurant and its concept of locally-sourced food made from scratch. He provided us with recommendations based on our preferences, and regularly checked-in with us during the meal.Food: YUM. Everything at FFB is locally sourced and fresh, and the quality of the food showed it. I would highly recommend the white wine & garlic mussel pot, as well as the kale salad. The sushi was also surprisingly delicious, despite FFB not explicitly being a sushi joint. I was thoroughly impressed! We even ordered dessert, which we almost never do, since we were curious if it would live up to the rest of the meal. (Spoiler alert: it did!)Location: This place was in walking distance of our hotel, so unfortunately I can't speak for parking. However, it's located in a complex with multiple restaurants and is pretty easy to spot, which is always a plus. :)Overall: Worth going out of your way for.

The pictures were only half of what we've ordered. Onto the food, the chicken was so well seasoned, not too salty and not too dry. The fisher's fry (fish and chips) just felt short to me, but that's okay. We also had the salad and I love how it's all fresh ingredients in there, very earthy texture to the salad again, well seasoned not too heavy on the seasoning, but effort has shown. The service was fast, he introduces us to some of the menu as well as giving us the introduction to the restaurant.

I heard good things about the buffet and knew I had to come check it out. I honestly wish I had a bigger tummy when I came to eat here. I didn't even get to try out everything I wanted to try. It might look small but they had great food. My husband wasn't really a fan of the place but I adore it.  I really wish we had something like this, here in Los Angeles. My reservation was at 11am and we were seated right on the dot. They had a couple of section for food. There was about four sections. First section-they had salad, grilled veggies, dips, hummus and my favorite the pimento cheese. The cheese spread on their flat bread was so good. I could had eaten that all day long. Second section-fried chicken, jambalaya, puffy tacos, fresh guacamole and chips. I actually didn't try the fried chicken but everything else was good. Third section-Egg scrambles, bacon, beef, yogurt and french toast. The bacon, of course, was the best ever. Dessert Table-I didn't even get to this part so I have no idea what was there. On top of that, you are welcome with biscuits and cinnamon rolls. I loved both. Don't do what I did and get extra full off this. You can also order eggs benedicts, sushi, fried shrimp with your waiter. I love that those come out from the kitchen. It might take some time to get them but they will eventually come. Patience, good things come to those who wait. Overall, I would be back if i'm ever in DC again.

And, believe me, you walk out of there feeling \"Buddha belly rubbing good\" after feasting on the likes of their many good eats!THE VIBEEye-catching spaces and really cool ambiance as soon as you walk through the door!  The space is open and organic, with eclectic, modern eating spaces through-out such as nautical-booths designed to look like a ships cabins, a functioning open pantry Larder with jars upon jars of vegetables, 360 view bar floating at the entrance, and exposed high-beamed windows with great views of the waterfront.  There is something interesting at every turn within this restaurant.THE EATSSimilar to their sister restaurant, Founding Farmers, the menu is definitely American fare and seasonally inspired. It changes often. From really good sushi plates, finger foods, seafood dishes, ribs to jambalaya.....even many vegetarian options....Farmers Fishers Bakers offers a diverse selection of regionally inspired, fresh dishes. Emphasis on the fresh. The only freezer in the kitchen, as our server jokingly said, is the one used for ice cream!  LOL.  So of course, we were all ears and ready to dive in on the fresh eats at this point.We started out with Sliders, Garlic Pepper Wings, Crab Dip and a large salad to share!  Everything was delicious!!  Not one dish fell short or missed the mark.  A double thumbs up goes to the Sliders and Crab Dip!Next, for the main course we tried several plates of the Memphis BBQ Ribs, Shrimp Scampi w/ Gnocchi, and the Honey Pot Fried Chicken Jambalaya!  The Jambalaya was really good and came loaded a quarter honey fried chicken on a skillet plate of seafood, and salad and spicy rice.  The flavor and spices were there for sure.  This claimed the \"Star of the Night\"....in my humble opinion.  The ribs were noteworthy too.  We finished off the night, with sharing an order of Benigets and Buttercream Cake.  I highly recommend the Buttercream cake.  It was delicious and everyone at the table agreed.  The benigets were a good attempt but by no means memorable or don't expect them to match Cafe du Monde in NOLA.THE VERDICT  Fisher Farmer Bakers gets my vote for the coveted high school senior superlative....\"Best All Around!\"  From the casual, hip vibe of the place, fresh food, and an accommodating menu that can cover anyone in your party...you can't go wrong with this place.  Not to mention, they offer Brunch on Saturdays/Sundays...that's pretty much worth trying for sure.  If you looking to impress friends or a special someone without breaking the bank...FFB is a great choice.  The service was great too.Throw in the views of the waterfront and ice skating rink (for the winter) and Farmers Fishers Bakers is one of the best places in DC to dine hands down."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/farmers-fishers-bakers-washington?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
