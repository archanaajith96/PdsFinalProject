I've had the luxury of coming to Electric Cheetah twice now. My boyfriend used to live in the area and swears by this place, so I loved that he always suggests taking me here whenever we're in town.The space itself is kind of small, but also gives off a cozy feel. The vibe is quite hip and the workers are all young, kind and welcoming. Electric Cheetah offers countless root beer options that I love! I'm not the biggest root beer fan, but I've since tried the Vanilla flavor by Henry Weinhards. IT IS HEAVENLY! So tasty and frothy. We live 300 miles away and love that we can purchase that root beer at Meijer now as well.Now ... their sandwiches. I'd drive back tonight just to have one of their sandwiches again! Heck, we are somewhere else when we were in town and stopped in for a carry out for the 3 hour drive home. That's how good their sandwiches are! Every sandwich is unique in its own way. My boyfriend swears by the \"It's Not My Brothers Sandwich\" (loaded with ketchup!) and I'm pretty keen on The Club Tickle. Everything is fresh and nothing is ever short on flavor. Portions are reasonable for the price and you definitely won't leave hungry. Don't miss out on the sweet potato fries .... seriously the best I ever had! So crispy, never soggy, and the honey dip sauce is to die for! My mouth is watering as I type this review! If you're in the area I highly recommend stopping in to Electric Cheetah!"}, {"review_id": "wHk8ksscfZzqoidHXUrMAQ", "user_id": "rsQ3ovyVjejF1jXE96CngQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Great service. Funky vibe. Got the Beefaroni Mac & Cheese and a House salad. The salad was solid. Just the right size and enough variety in taste. The Mac was good, not great. I like my M&C a little baked and decadently creamy. It tasted fresh and slightly cheesy. Some will like but it wasn't my style. I would go back and try some of their burgers next time."}, {"review_id": "4UT6KKuNsCkx86HGr53Q1Q", "user_id": "90b_GEqxUOTz9AX6k-nTeA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Inconsistency is what comes to mind when thinking about EC.

Didn't have one since 2007. It was not the traditional sub or thick, flour bread because in the place was regular ole' slices of GF (maybe Udi's?) bread. Yet, the taste did not disappoint. Wine and beer only and they served my pinot noir cold. Hmmmm....If you love rootbeer this is your place! That is their speciality. GF options are marked on the menu. They don't have a GF fryer but they do have GF bread for the sandwiches. The server was knowledgable, too. Booths with low-top and wood chairs and high-top seating available at the small 7-seat bar. Brightly-lit environment and family friendly. We waited 20 minutes on a weekday evening at 6:30pm."}, {"review_id": "kkZL7vcjdj-b8jGoz0d66w", "user_id": "zQT4EcwqpPU4OfaUQuI_Ow", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "If you're looking for a twist on some classic dishes, this is definitely the place to go. Compared to other restaurants in the area, the food here is delicious and different. Specifically, what I enjoyed most about this restaurant​ was that they had over 20 different root beer flavors! Each one sounded amazing, however, ​I ended up trying one with a vanilla twist to it. I did not enjoy the grilled cheese though, as I felt that the sauce added to the cheese did not compliment the dish well. If in the area again, I would definitely​ return. The prices are a bit on the high end- but you won't​ find anything similar anywhere else."}, {"review_id": "bve41qyfoSsSN-6sDSTgVQ", "user_id": "NZDIqo2V41WwQmpuAI-lYA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "When did The Electric Cheetah start selling half fried sweet potatoes?

We used to love The Cheetah, but this night was miserable. We were slow to be seated. In fact, we stood waiting while two tables were empty only to be told, rudely, by host/manager? that he was slowing down seating anyone (i.e. us, as we were the only ones waiting) because the kitchen was behind. Rather than seat us and bring us drinks, he made us stand by the door and wait for like 20 minutes. He then sat us right by the restroom instead of one of the available tables by the window. The menu has been stripped down to one page. Not much left. The salad I ordered was missing major ingredients.Server said they no longer serve cocktails and the night we were there, they had no wine. None. I felt sorry for the server, who did his best. Things were out of his control so I can say he was the only good thing that night. We will not go back until we know that new management has fixed everything. That's if we ever decide to try agin. Too bad, this used to be such a clutch spot."}, {"review_id": "Jm-Xw4CGSHV9bqFPR6kP7Q", "user_id": "E99PmzemavhAxUMNOGKlWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Many items on menu are pork related.

Eveyone was so friendly, and made us feel welcome. The natural light and the neighborhood really add to the unique ambiance of the place.  Bathrooms were clean, and you can tell this is a well managed restaurant.So many people commented positively about the sweet potato fries. They are different from thw style that I like, and ours were quite soggy.  The style these were served on were not crispy, and lacked seasoning. The sauces that are served with the fries are awesome -  so all was not lost.TL;DR - Location, service and decor are fun and awesome.  Enjoy a wide variety of bottled root beers, but dont expect the food to be overly memorable.  Great place for a date, kids meal, or casual get together."}, {"review_id": "izVg4va_hLCU6NHB_DSyDw", "user_id": "c3qZkMGSN8ANOKoBUeRBlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "This fun, funky spot has everything essential if you're looking for something different: eclectic decor, cleverly worded menu, top-notch food served fast by fun, funky, friendly people. I had the Yahtzee sandwich -- delicious pieces of fried chicken with the perfect amount of heat on a perfectly toasted brioche bun. Sooo good! I would have happily paid full price for this sandwich, and then some, but the menu states that if the guest rolls a Yahtzee, the sandwich is free -- as long as the guest yells \"YAHTZEE!!\" loudly. I rolled five 6's in two rolls. The yelling wasn't a problem. Everyone there knew I won! My daughter had the Not Your Brother's Mac & Cheese. She loved it! The spiral noodles were drenched in a cheesy sauce and topped with similar chicken to what was in my sandwich. We both had a butterscotch root beer. YUM! The menu says they have 40 different kinds of root beer, but we were only told about three. We'll definitely be back!!"}, {"review_id": "Ptp7EU3-xr8OTofydyPlQg", "user_id": "dZJcC1aGNltYPKJVwHT22w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "This place use to be amazing however they've changed the menu arounda bit and honestly it left us disappointed. The sweet potato fries were terrific and they now have changed them into more wedges or steak fries.
