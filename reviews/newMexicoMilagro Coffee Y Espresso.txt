Whats not to like about that, right? I found this spot while I was taking a break from driving and decided to get a hotel. I needed some coffee so when I found Milagro Coffee Y Espresso, I was excited. The espresso is a blend of 3 and while dark and bold, it is surprisingly smooth! I really like that they are roasting in the back. I got the Green Chile Bagel with Green Chile Cream Cheese and it was fantastic, did not let me down! The service was better the second time I came in but overall could have been a little cleaner inside. I sat at the bar area in the front and it was a little dirty but nothing too bad. The place seems to be well liked by the locals as well. Many of the tables were filled both times I was there but there was still plenty of room for everyone. I think the lady told me that they have been around for 20 years. Wow, great job guys.

This past weekend, I went to do some work and ordered their new ham and cheese crepe. It comes with a rather strong mustard sauce, which I was unaware of. After 2 bites I decided I couldn't finish it as is and asked if there was any way I could have it remade without the sauce.The employee gave me an annoyed eye roll and sigh, the plate was snatched out of my hand, and within view, angrily tossed into the sink. When he brought the new plate, he tossed it onto the counter I was sitting at and walked off. I decided then that I won't go back for at least a year, visiting The Pot Coffee House or Beck's instead. After talking with others about what happened, it seems service here has steadily declined."}, {"review_id": "wi8AdqHsvKVaPhQJXalT4A", "user_id": "qMl6VlVy9qeg6q_VWjF-6w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "I was so excited to try coffee here which is probably why the disappointment hit me hard. I'm a weirdo that likes my coffee cold, but this cold brew was disgusting. Maybe it was a bad day for them, but even trying to alter the taste by adding crap to it - didnt help. It tasted like soapy dish water mixed with old coffee.My friends enjoyed the espresso so that's a plus. Very rarely will i not finish my cup or glass of coffee. This is the first time in the history of ever that I couldn't do it. The amount of coffee consumed mirrors that of the picture i posted on here. I'm just hoping it was an off day, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to try this place again."}, {"review_id": "Ed7ym_7hYIH7qVImKlotog", "user_id": "-FZBTkAZEXoP7CYvRV2ZwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "This was my coffee stop on my first day in the city of Las Cruces. After getting some amazing Mexican food, I was in need of some coffee to get me through the rest of the day. I checked my Yelp app, and found this place nearby.I drove into the large shopping plaza in which this coffee shop sits. Parking spots were in abundance, and I found the plaza to be well-lit and clean as I made my way toward this place.Once inside, I found a nice and relaxing atmosphere. I checked out their menu, and asked which coffee was best for a quick pick-me-up. They suggested the \"atomic brew,\" which included cold brew and several shots of espresso. It was strong and to-the-point, the way I like my coffee. I ordered one for that evening, and another to-go for the morning after. And boy, did that coffee live up to its name.The staff was friendly here, they were very warm and welcoming. We had a brief conversation while I was waiting for my coffee. I got some inside tips about Las Cruces, and I gave the same about LA. The other patrons were friendly people, and the environment here looked ideal to study or get work done. I'd recommend this place for a good cup of Joe."}, {"review_id": "IarbfyrDvfTj3bZbl-yeXg", "user_id": "VEvseMmJRh15q1DdXf_qSQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/12/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I still love the coffee here.  They pour beautiful cappucini (see photo)I mostly came back to take back whatever I said about \"the Bean\", I was thinking of some other place altogwther"}, {"review_id": "ADwWXUxdHhL4xFosL5nk0g", "user_id": "7-ZdIqO2lcAZYV-fPkb9YQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Loved going here.

As a first time diner I was hesitant and excited.  I love new adventures and they have coffee so you can't go wrong. I ordered a whole chocolate mocha, apple strudel slice and lox bagel special. The whole order was about 10.00 and beautiful presented. Mocha was designed in the top basic leaf swirl and strudel was fresh. Bagel special has the lox, cream cheese, capers, onion and tomato. Toasted great and well seasoned food. Highly recommended for the morning coffee and quiet time.  Free wifi always a plus in a technology world."}, {"review_id": "IccdSYquii6MOLuxXIDReA", "user_id": "ZD5LLFqUiyqBCcHqZjk7tg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "Just went to Milagros for the first time, tried their ham and cheese panini and it tasted like dirt so I opened it up to find mold all over the bread, showed it to them and they said sorry.

But this last time I went in it was plagued by flies. It was truly disgusting to have to be swatting flies off your food and drink and seeing flies in the area where food is being prepared!

When I asked if I could get one hot, they suggested I MICROWAVE it. -Today there was a hair in my drink-There was NO SOAP in the bathroom, the same bathroom that the employees use!-Music was so aggressive and unnerving!

It's great, especially the Brazilian and Tanzania pea berry. Unfortunately I can no longer patronize this store because of the total indifference of the counter staff.
