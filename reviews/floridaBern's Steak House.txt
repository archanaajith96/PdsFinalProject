I have been here 5 different times in the last 6 months and it meets my expectations every time. The service is outstanding.  I prefer the filet or the delmonico.

Upon arrival to this restaurant you quickly learn that this will not just be a meal, but rather an unforgettable experience. From the cheese crackers to dessert, everything was impeccable. The French onion soup had the thickest layer of cheese and the homemade dressings on the salad was amazing. I recommend ordering the house wine as the delicate combination of red wines mixed was perfect. I ordered the chateaubriand and it cut like butter. This steak was perfect to be ordered medium rare. After dinner we took a tour of the kitchen and wine cellar. With over 100,000 bottles of wine, it is understandable why this is the largest private wine collection in probably the world. After our tour we ended up in the dessert room where a table was waiting for us. Pictured is the only part of my meal I was able to snap because it was too good to not put the phone away and enjoy. The dessert room had a piano player and each table had their own music options. Being able to experience Bern's Steakhouse was a highlight and I cannot reiterate how amazing it is!

I find people either love this place or hate it. No in between.  I am a lover of the atmosphere, which is dark, sultry and alive, the service, which is impeccable ( one of my favorite server's is Brian ) and the food. I usually order the Special Chateau or a piece of fish. All meals are served with soup, salad, veggies, potato and bread. It is rare to find a restaurant that does this anymore. I am able to get a delicious steak dinner for under $40.00!!!  They have the worlds largest wine list. Everything is made in-house. The dressings for the salads are awesome. I'm a fan of the blue cheese and the cilantro vinegarette. The bernaise sauce is divine. It is a nice addition to the steak, as is the mushroom brian. The french onion soup is to die for. I normally opt out of the potato and ask for extra veggies. It is a lot of food so I do not get appetizers . I have gotten the steak cobb salad for dinner before and it is great. On occasion I have been known to order the steak sandwich, which is not on the menu. It does hit the spot.The dessert room is fun and is quite an experience. If you have not visited the upstairs room for sweet treats I suggest you do so. You will find yourself being seated in your own compartment. They do not serve dessert in the main dining rooms.The bar is festive. The full menu is offered here. If you want to sit at the bar you will need to tell the bartender, as they sit folks here on a first come first serve basis. He keeps a running list. I believe his name is Mario. BTW, you will need reservations if you want table seating. They keep a hand full of tables open in the back for walk in's. In my experience they are gone by 6:30 and at that point you will have a two hour wait. This is where we sat last night.This Tampa dining destination is worth every penny in my humble opinion."}, {"review_id": "o8yycpwoKJ0CT5ELMjlVDQ", "user_id": "znwODXzidOxJysE_I-Glkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "This is the Florida equivalent of Lugers back in NY.

Whether it is St Elmo's in Indy or Bones in Atlanta, enjoying a wonderfully cooked steak in a beautiful atmosphere with top notch service is one of the best dining experiences one can find in America. Bern's Steak House, located in Tampa off Howard Ave in a very hip district, stands right up there as one of America's great steakhouse experiences.My wife and I, after spending several years in Central Florida, finally got the chance to check out Berns the other night (you have to make your reservations online pretty well in advance). We arrived at the venue, valeted the car and went inside to a wonderful entrance area that is beautifully decorated and lit up in a classy red manner. After waiting for a few minutes and doing some people watching (lots of families come here...not something I'm used to seeing at steakhouses), the hostess took us back to our seats. The restaurant is gigantic (with various rooms with unique and interesting looks), so we walked for a good 20 seconds before finally getting all the way to the room with our table. We arrived at our table and our wonderful waitress handed us the menu and gave us a road map for the night. Since Bern's is more an experience rather than just a dinner, she told us to give the menu a good initial lookthru, and then she would come back for drinks, to explain the food, to bring food and then take us to post-food experiences. I wish I could remember her name, but she was very calm, professional and gave excellent input and recommendations.We started off our night by ordering a nice bottle of wine. While Bern's has over 100,000 wines from all over the world (which makes a pretty big wine menu), they also have many good wines for pretty good prices. We ordered a $50 2012 Northstar Columbia Valley Merlot that was absolutely delightful. We actually were given samples of a few wines to try from beforehand and picked this one out due to taste and some personal preferences. Our waitress came and refilled our glass every few minutes and even kept out the rougher stuff in the bottom of the bottle from our decanter (which I then poured into my wine at the end...don't do that).In terms of food, while Bern's prices on steaks are actually quite reasonable, I decided to order the Kitchen within a Kitchen Surf and Turn special of Filet Mignon and 4 ozs of Maine Lobster that came with a asparagus and a fun bacon bread pudding. My wife ordered the Luxe Beef Tasting option, which includes 100 Day Dry Aged Delmonico, Filet Mignon & Japanese Wagyu Strip. Each entree was about $70-$80, which for the amount of food you get is quite a deal.Soon after placing our order, the waitress brought out an appetizer that I can best describe as a warm cheese bread cracker. It was absolutely fantastic and just the right size to start a big meal. We then moved on to have a great French Onion Soup and a very pretty salad (the chunks of blue cheese with my wife's salad were HUGE). This all then cleared the way for our main course I described above, both of which were magnificent. My filet mignon was actually our favorite out of all of the meats and something I would definitely recommend trying. After finishing our meal, the next stop on our Bern's experience was the Bern's tour of the kitchen (so much going on) and the massive wine cellar. We were made to feel like VIPs as we whisked from the kitchen down to a chilly cellar with wines as far as the eye could see. One of the highlights of the tour is a crystal decanter worth over $180k! Talk about something you don't get to see with most meals.After completing our tour, we then were able to go up to the Harry Waugh's Dessert Room! We went up some stairs, waited a couple minutes, and then walked to our seats, which were in a solitary booth style surrounded by walls showing old-time recipes! Next to our table was an old time phone and some buttons to change the style of music for our table in particular. The waiter then came over, told us about some of the options, and put in our order for a fun dessert coffee and peanut butter chocolate treat that was to die for. Talk about a magnificent ending to a wonderful night.Overall, Bern's Steak House provides a completely unforgettable steakhouse experience. The venue, service, food and experiences make Bern's a venue that anyone who visits Central Florida must try at least once...and maybe a few more times if you are lucky."}, {"review_id": "Uv9vgjoEzz82ZB8rhJ9aqA", "user_id": "ZQ-hVBie3ls9u951cJkgSQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Bern's has been on my bucket list for quite some time, I was given a gift certificate and never jumped on making reservations early enough to get a decent time; they were always booked or had only 10:30 left, but decided to try for a Monday night reservation and was able to get 8:30.They were awesome about sending a confirmation email as well as one the day before with information on valet parking and the dessert room.We arrived a bit early and valet parked ($5.00) our car, they guys were friendly and directed us to the host stand where we were welcomed and told we would be seated closer to 8:30 and shown to the lounge. The lounge has lots of seating, the servers really hustle but remain warm and friendly, checking on us and bringing our bar tab to our table in the dining room. In addition to a sizable beer list there are over 150 wines by the glass. I chose the Carneros - Buena Vista 2012, Pinot Noir ($10.85) and my husband selected a Ballast Point Grapefruit Sculpin ($6.00). The wine was excellent, full bodied and a smooth finish (I had another with dinner); the beer was not identified as an IPA and it was a little hoppy for my husband's taste.We were called to our table about 8:40 and seated in the Burgundy Room, a small room with 12 tables. I think we threw our server off when he approached the table I gave him a check presenter with cash that was left by whoever reset the table. He apologized, scurried away and never remembered to introduce himself when he returned to offer water and drinks. He did a great job of explaining the menu, cuts of steak and their dry aging process.Entrees come with Onion Soup, a house salad, vegetables of the day, onion straws and a baked potato. We were going to the dessert room we didn't need ​any additional food,​ but there were several things I'd love to try.The onion soup was a small portion, plenty of melted cheese with a very crisp spelt crouton, the broth was rich and flavorful. We chose blue cheese dressing for our salads and it was AMAZING, probably the best I've ever had with lots of blue cheese. The salad was a mix of greens with ripe tomatoes, cucumber, white onion, carrots, celery, hard-boiled egg, cheese and sprouts. We found out on our kitchen tour they grow their own sprouts.I ordered a 12 ounce Sirloin Strip ($ 46.92) Medium Rare. Steaks are trimmed and then weighed so you get a full 12 ounces of meat. They remove the fattier end of the sirloin and replaced it with insanely tender filet mignon. The steak was cooked perfectly with a nice crust and great flavor. My husband selected the 12 ounce Delmonico  Steak ($48.14) Medium and asked them to leave the marbling. The steak was cooked perfectly and while it was flavorful he said it was OK. Both steaks came with sautéed carrots as well as sautéed collard greens and bok choy, as well as baked potatoes served tableside with butter, sour cream, bacon and chives.Only down side to dinner was that our server was triple seated and the tables ordered bottles of wine and multiple appetizers requiring quite a lot of his time; he wasn't nearly as engaging as other servers around us.After dinner we were escorted on a kitchen and wine cave tour. The kitchen is a well-oiled machine, amazingly clean and organized. I can't say enough things about the young lady who showed us the wine cave; very knowledgeable about the history of the cellar, the storing and handling of older vintages, ports and fortified wines and the pricing of some very rare vintages.We were then escorted upstairs to the dessert room. It is a maze of small seating areas made to resemble barrels each has its own music system, our server was very friendly and engaging. My husband had the  Build Your Own Sundae ($11.50) a freshly made waffle bowl with three scoops of homemade ice cream. He selected two scoops of French dark chocolate and one of their AMAZING macadamia nut, it came with whipped cream and he selected the dark chocolate sauce.I had their house Café Con Leche ($5.25) which was as good as any I've ever had, and the King Midas ($11.95) A signature recipe of rich and moist carrot nut cake served with Macadamia Nut Ice Cream and hot fudge. A Bern's original. Not a chocolate fan I left off the hot fudge as there was a little chocolate painted on the plate. The ice cream is outstanding with lots of macadamia nuts, the carrot cake was good, very, very dense and rich.As it was my birthday, our server brought out a small tuille cookie with whipped cream and a candle but thankfully didn't sing!We had an amazing evening; I've been told that there are better steaks but go for the experience, I agree you have to go for the experience but the steak and food were really excellent as well."}, {"review_id": "8VIi23eX0HcEve8gezRjNg", "user_id": "nZceu5RbhijnpmkEvJShLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I have never had a better meal.  Absolutely worth the price for any special occasion.  Don't be fooled by the unimpressive outside of the building.  Once you walk through the front door the atmosphere is very elegant.I have heard that you can go here and not get a steak...

The two desserts we shared (pineapple upside down cake and the chocolate brownie/ice cream with chocolate sauce and berries) were both wonderful. Live pianist was phenomenal.Only downside: wine service. Tables near ours ordered some wine.Server 1 - announced the name and very briefly showed the bottle, never framing it against a napkin. He put the bottle on the table and opened it on the table. Once he removed the cork he then grabbed the cork/corkscrew and twisted the cork off the of corkscrew and not the other way around. You DONT touch the cork. It was never placed in front of the guest to squeeze to verify storage or bleed into the cork. Then when pouring he did at least offer a taste first, but he didn't present the label to the person he was pouring to. His hand was covering the label. The person who is receiving wine should ALWAYS be able to read the label while you pour. He neglected to go ladies first too. Bad form.Server 2 - same careless presentation and opening, but at least it wasn't ON the table for this one. Similar issues though, lack of a framing of the bottle, just general apathy towards service.Their bad service kept me from ordering my own wine. We got mixed drinks instead.Overall, whether it's a $30 bottle Rutherford Ranch or $2500 bottle of Margaux, the same level of service should be given."}, {"review_id": "U0H4CqTS5UzrOZ9xVkAyYw", "user_id": "aLzVD9osp2C5mbRodYC3kA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "This is a classic.

I probably should have read my original review because I've learned I tend to make the same decisions. I went with the Delmonico again and once again learned they suggest you order it Medium Rare. It still comes out very red, but I found the cut to be a little chewy. The menu suggests that when you have the option to order a larger cut for two and since this time I had my dad with me who loves his meat rare we went for 16 oz of the Delmonico cooked Medium Rare.  I would try a different cut of meat next time, because I felt like I wore my chompers out chewing. Again, if you aren't a wine person you can get out of here with a pretty reasonable bill. However, this time we were with a wine person so the bill was much larger. For example, we ended up ordering two bottles of wine. One was $130 and the other was $270. You can order wine that is a lot more expensive or less. They also offer wine by the glass. My dad drinks wine all over the world and loves to tour different wineries. This place was made for him. He got to talk shop with the sommelier and they bonded. That's probably how this meal ended up lasting four hours (that included the kitchen and dessert room tour. No dessert because we were stuffed). All the sides/appetizers that come with the steak are delicious. It is also relaxing to know that no matter what you'll end up with great service. They train their waitstaff really well here. If you like wine, this will be high on your list to visit. I have to give it five stars this time because I saw it through the eyes of a wine connoiseur. It's the experience that makes it as good as it gets."}, {"review_id": "4kFwo8oB1DgraPevmqxYfA", "user_id": "mqhEXTvNG0juAzJ-5EV3CA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Really not worth reviewing since everyone knows it's just flat out fabulous.    If you go to Tampa - then go to Berns.   Be prepared to pay but you will get what you pay for.  Great beef , great lamb, great sides.   Can't go wrong.   Maybe one day I'll even try the fish.  :-)Love the kitchen and wine cellar tour and of course the desert rooms upstairs."}, {"review_id": "JKUcWNVAPoqm9UwgeZMFxg", "user_id": "nZKnG2KEen3pM6Y2BxBoDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "I LOVED the Wagyu steak, but a few ounces would have been enough due to the richness.

My husband loves this place. It may be his favorite steakhouse in the world. We don't really do steakhouses often, as he makes some of the best steaks on the grill. But we decided to splurge and have dinner at Bern's on my birthday. It was fabulous. The ambiance is a super cool old steak house feel, which for some reason always includes a lot of red. We started off with drinks at the bar. My martini was icy cold and delicious. For some reason steakhouses always know how to make a great martini. Next we moved into the dining room, and there is a book, seriously a hardcover book, that contained the infamous extensive wine list. The selection is overwhelming, representing old world and new world wines. We settled on a Brunello from Italy, which was presented beautifully as part of the wine service. The steak dinners comes with French Onion soup, a salad, potato and seasonal vegetables. You will not go hungry! You order your steak by cut, thickness and temperature. We got an aged NY Strip that was big enough to share. It was cooked perfectly and very tasty. Though, I must say that I still think my husband does a better steak. However, we got a Maine lobster tail added, and this was definitely my favorite part of the meal. After dinner, there is a tour of the kitchen and wine cellar. It's definitely worth doing at least once, but I'm pretty sure my husband does it every time he goes to Bern's. The last stop is the Dessert Room, and there is a nice selection is desserts and dessert drinks. I had a minty boozy hot chocolate drink and we spilt a dessert that consisted of chocolate and peanut butter. Yum!

It is important to keep in mind that Bern's considers and promotes itself to be one of the top steakhouses in the Country. By that standard, my experience falls far short. The first of two major disappointments relates to the accommodation given to patrons who's dress fell far short of the the restaurant's dress code. Among other things, the Code clearly states that blue jeans are not appropriate and that those wearing such clothing may be seated in the lobby, as opposed to a dining room. However, nearly one half of the people seated in our dining room, and others that were seated in other dining rooms, were wearing jeans. This blatant lack of adherence and enforcement of the dress code diminishes the experience for those patrons who respect the dress code and positions Bern's as a restaurant no more special than Outback Steakhouse. Ambiance - here the restaurant earns the highest of ratings. The reception area, though small, conveys opulence. The restaurant is divided into many rooms of various dimensions. Each room is well appointed and elegant. Service - both of our servers (dinner and dessert is served separately in different rooms) earned high marks. They were both pleasant and attentive.Food/Entree- the menu is heavily weighted to steaks. However, there are other options of interest such as rack of lamb. My wife ordered a 6 oz filet and I a 14oz Delmonico (both Medium). The steaks are accompanied by a small bowl of French Onion soup, a house salad, a baked potato and mixed vegetables. The soup, salad, baked potato and veggies were excellent. The steaks? Average, at best. My steak tasted great, but was not tender in the least. In fact, I have had Delmonico/Rib Eyes at chain restaurants that were as good or better. Food/Dessert - served on the second floor of the restaurant, the dessert portion of the meal was everything and more of what you might hope for. The individual dining areas, the piped in live music and the desserts all add up to a must do experience. I had the pineapple upside down cake, which was very good. If you live in the Tampa area and are looking for a great steak, my recommendation would be Jesse's in Brandon. The ambiance is lacking, but it is a great value and an excellent steak."}, {"review_id": "JY6JuYqTIMeg4ypPWPoH3A", "user_id": "iADDLQeEqSbW906pJApC6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Bern's is an institution and deservedly so. It's one of those restaurants you save for special occasions like birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, holidays and any other reason you can find to go. Dining at Bern's is as much about the experience as it is about the food. To start, you should block off an entire evening for a visit to Bern's. You need time to soak in the atmosphere, ambiance and vibe of the place. The dining space is broken into various rooms, each with it's own feel. While we've jokingly referred to the decor as \"Victorian-era brothel\", it does work. The combination of leather, oil paintings and dim lighting produce a very old-world effect. You should also plan to dress for dinner. This is not the type of place to show up in jeans or a golf shirt. The service is flawless. We been told that the training to become a waiter can take years and is not taken lightly. This is reflected in the service which has never disappointed us. The staff always seems to know exactly what you want/need before you do. It's a nice change from what we've experienced in some larger, chain restaurants. Since you're probably going for the food, let me offer a few tips. First, don't over-order. Most entree's include French Onion Soup au Gratin, salad, Steak House onion rings, loaded baked potato and vegetable. There are lots of great appetizer choices, but just be advised there is lots of food to come. Secondly, when ordering steak, try to combine orders rather then order individual steaks. For example rather than ordering two 6 oz Filet Mignon's, order a single 12 oz steak. This larger portion of beef is cooked and sliced table side. Believe us, there is an awesome improvement in the taste of the meat. Finally, be sure to ask your waiter to reserve a table in the Henry Waugh Dessert Room upstairs for your post-dinner drinks and sweets. Not only is this another amazing experience, you also get a tour of the kitchen and wine cellar on your way upstairs. In case we've been vague, Bern's is and always will be one of our favorite steak houses of all time. Maybe we'll see y'all there next time."}, {"review_id": "URiJ0mdeTaqC5W5C5tB6QQ", "user_id": "2M5nrxf_CBlu-y0lKoqGhQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "My other review was deleted for some reason so I am determined to write another. Only come here if you plan to have steak and wine. Period. The people who love this place are steak people and that's fine but if your dining partner prefers fish, chicken or is a vegetarian then your meal is not going to be 5 stars. Their fish entrees are boring and poorly executed. You can look at their menu and see that. I hoped that because the notoriety the fish entrees would still be amazing. Not so. I have had better and paid less.  Vegetarians and vegans: run. I've had both their vegetarian and vegan option - lackluster and crude are the adjectives that come to mind. Though the veggies have a wonderful grill char on them the oil is overbearing. And it's not even truffle oil.Go ahead, tell me \"well MZ, this is a steakhouse so don't order fish here.\" To that I respond, well if the restaurant is unable to prepare a dish properly then do NOT offer it. At the $40 and up per entree cost, the dish better be in point. Mise en Place is so much better than this place; Mise has exquisite steak and fish and vegetarian options. Though I cringe at using a chain as a comparison, Ocean Prime is another fantastic example of being experts at both steak and seafood. What a concept: making sure everything on your menu is delicious."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/berns-steak-house-tampa?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
