Seriously, hands down, best cupcakes of my life. I always stop and pick up a few when I go through Missoula. Plus they have gluten-free cupcakes that are to die for. Ten years ago I had Bernice's make our wedding cake and it could not have been better. They are an all scratch bakery. The only thing I have always wanted Bernice's to add is an espresso machine. At least you can get a nice hot cup of joe!"}, {"review_id": "ODrkC342IQHicaLJL0ZK8w", "user_id": "tbNcv0SW6xY8ktwfQkDYXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "We stopped here on a whim.

Pumpkin muffins are my favorite. If you're vegan you can totally eat them, too. Cupcakes are excellent. Duh. I like those little cupcake boxes they have for them at GFS, the ones that just hold one cupcake. They probably aren't biodegradable. Maybe they are. In any case they make getting a cupcake home a lot easier. I can't think of anything I don't like about Bernice's. I also really like the bright paint job they put on a few years back."}, {"review_id": "1foVJE3L9QRN9z-4O-yjLw", "user_id": "TPwIuCuVBXzmcdk7e9rOUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/8/2017", "text": "Coffee still delivers; pumpkin muffin, GF pink sugar cookie, Tipu's chai...all good.

As a matter of fact we have been there about 8 times! My fav flavor cupcake at Bernice's is the lavender frosting on a chocolate cupcake.  Another Bernice's favorite is the Montana shaped sugar cookie -- I'm not sure what the frosting is on it ... Some sort of buttercream, but it is not the hardened frosting that is typical on the sugar cookie. And the few pies I have got there are delicious as well. Great crust and filling. We have had lunch there and enjoyed that as well as the coffee. The employees are always pleasant and nice. They are happy to recite the many flavors of cupcakes that are on display in the case, which they probably have to do many many times a day. It's a regular visit for us in Missoula!"}, {"review_id": "qC6xGOsSWLIgZs19ujhN_w", "user_id": "oBIw_mPbUkKSm3GNslUErg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/16/2017", "text": "Best bakery in town (and one of the best I've been to)!!

We ended up visiting Bernice's twice during my stay, and I think my daughter will be back during the school year. Things we tried: black and white cake, key lime cake, lemon bar, peach blueberry pie, and german chocolate cake. Tea and cider one cold night, too. Both times, we came in the early evening (6-ish) and thought it was a warm,welcoming place to be. I could see older people chatting, a few young people studying, and others like us just there for dessert and conversation. They don't have a huge selection- both times we went there were two cakes (being sold by the slice. There were more that you could purchase as a whole cake option) and one pie, and maybe 7 or 8 pastry options (both savory and sweet) plus cupcakes. It was still very hard to choose because everything looked so good."}, {"review_id": "QudvwaKUexIzAdfTAF992A", "user_id": "W1hEYZDcG4zHYLaENL3S-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/20/2015", "text": "Excellent cookies and pastry.  I also like their soup that comes with a slab of great sourdough(?) bread.  But, get this........they charge you for butter.  Butter is a staple at our house and so I had to have it, but was surprised to be charged for it.They do offer a great place to visit and connect with people in Missoula.  Close to MeadowSweet Herbs and so it has this great \"village' kind of vibe.Enjoy, Judy Helm Wright"}, {"review_id": "ojbZthS1UC6WUJk0h93AgA", "user_id": "JL_IYjd_C-ci_LTxlW7fMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/29/2016", "text": "Spent $50 at Bernice's (literally)...couldn't get enough of their pastries, coffee (and oh yeah we bought a shirt and coffee mug).
