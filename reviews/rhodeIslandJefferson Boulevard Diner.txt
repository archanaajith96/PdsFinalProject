The location is small, but if you are looking for something quick, easy, and satisfying this is a good place to stop. It's right off the highway so it is a very convenient location and the food was exactly what you'd except at a local breakfast dinner like this. The only issue seemed to be that the morning when I met a colleague there it seemed to be understaffed. Not sure if it is normally this busy on a Wednesday morning, but the poor waitress was pretty much stuck by herself running the breakfast bar and the rest of the restaurant. Overall though she was friendly, the food was good, and the prices were  inexpensive. If you are in the area stop on in."}, {"review_id": "0E6jwToPynLUapPNF1tchw", "user_id": "MK2dNNDeofvGIlo-Bs5Qmg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "The breakfast was delicious.

I had a bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin. Def tasty, but next time I'll get the muffin toasted dry instead of grilled with butter. Hubs had the Heavenly Hash breakfast and raved about it for about an hour after. Prices are reasonable, coffee is good and the staff is welcoming. We went early on a Saturday and sat right away, but I'm betting it fills up pretty quick. Regardless, it would be worth the wait!"}, {"review_id": "kntQsvJNwbJ3yLDIwsmEvw", "user_id": "sfel3yPwPqMMEZ2E9-EApA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/24/2016", "text": "I love coming here.

Eggs were done perfectly, the home fries are so exceptional that my bf kept stealing from me. I can tell the chocolate pancakes are also good, because he ate it all.
