We've gone here regularly over the last couple of years and have tried just about everything on the menu and we keep coming back. The flavors are spot on and the veggies are always fresh. The lumpia and empanadas are a must try. There is always a large selection of sweets plus halo-halo dessert and pearl coolers. A new special is on the menu every week too. I always make it a point to check it on their Facebook page. On Sundays, You-Ka carries a brunch menu (tocilog, tapsilog, and longanisa) and another Filipino tofu breakfast of taho. To top it off, the service is always good and the restaurant is always clean."}, {"review_id": "UnkP5WBAzpK9uNdxcPFOJg", "user_id": "bdioqQKiTUMA_5JLCKdN5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "PROs:-they use meal prep containers (no styrofoam)-try #3, 6, 7 (freshly made to order)  -Military discount -clean restroom with a changing table-for dessert try the halo-halo & turon.-pleasant service"}, {"review_id": "mOY5rVBicqTNYVdzlyXcSg", "user_id": "LB3D-LCy1o6lo85rMFcMQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "My mother in California was making homemade Chicken Adobo at home and I sort of felt homesick and needed some Filipino food in my life! Thank goodness You-Ka Café is in Colorado because I totally ordered their Chicken Adobo and Lumpia with rice. The chicken was marinated so well, tasted juicy and soft. There were slices of cucumbers which kind of cooled your palette while eating their warm lumpia. I really thought I needed more food, but I was already stuffed from what I had ordered. While my husband and I were eating, one of the managers came up to us to make sure if we enjoyed our food. He was so nice! We struck up a conversation about when they opened, that his wife is a chef in training, and that their daughters are also working at their restaurant. Also, he informed us that they serve breakfast on Sundays and serve Tocino, Longanisa, and Taho. I had also ordered their Halo-Halo, because how could you not order Halo-Halo in a Filipino restaurant? ;) I really loved their Halo-Halo! The ice was blended so that you didn't have to chew on the ice, the Ube ice-cream was delicious, the Leche-Flan, Ube, and even the red beans were soft (unlike some that are just a nuisance to eat). My husband & I shared and pretty much fought over it because it was so good! All in all, clean store, friendly customer service, and great food. Definitely coming back when I have Filipino Food cravings!"}, {"review_id": "tWg3x2rJTPPqAeB0mzewdw", "user_id": "R9NDJdbkOb0viBA95aLh_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I have been twice now and love it both times.

Unfortunately, I'm only in the area for vacation so I'm sad that I can't come to You-Ka as often as I like. In my short week here, I've come here twice and had it as my last meal before my flight.I loved the Kare Kare. I think the sauce is the right consistency for the meat and eggplant and bok choy. I'm a huge fan. The lumpia is also super yummy and crisp and comes with the meal.Also, try the desserts here. The bread pudding was good. I also really liked the flan.I tried halo halo for the first time. I'm impressed. It's so different from anything I've had. There's so much in it, even rice krispies!I think this is a family owned restaurant, which is always a plus!"}, {"review_id": "fVAW8Q1Mrm-_PJp0vCgiUw", "user_id": "vIjx_95gI8RmTANP274Q4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "It is a small Filipino restaurant in a block where is multiple restaurants.  I ate a lot of Filipino food but this one was different.

So first, walking into the restaurant it was a heavenly aroma of teriyaki smelling meat on the grill. That alone gets your taste buds ready for a delightful treat. So excited to taste my food, I ate a lumpia on the way home, not knowing what it was. Basically it's a piece of meat with eggroll wrapper around it. Quite yummy. But it went downhill from there. I ordered a number five. Barbecued pork. It's basically 10-11 bucks for lunch, unless you order a drink. From reading the reviews I knew that I wanted to order PORK, not chicken. I very clearly stated that I wanted pork when the cashier asked. And what do you think my to go order was? CHICKEN.  I can't blame the very personable owner for this, but it was still quite disappointing. Now, don't get me wrong, I love chicken, but I eat it at home all the time and so when I go out I typically like to try what a restaurant can do with pork or beef.Basically it was a few slices of chicken marinated in a ok tasting teriyaki type sauce with a cup of rice. I thought it was OK, but nothing to write home about and not something I would order again. In a word, eh. I missed having anything vegetable like in my order. Probably my fault for not ordering something else. I didn't really think it looked or tasted like it was a $10 meal and while I may try this place again, at dinner time, I would eat in and definitely order something other than chicken. My preference would be half the amount of rice and some type of vegetable included in my meal."}, {"review_id": "Mub_irridJ3qVDtnUJksXQ", "user_id": "MPiLBHXnUiWvTQRuh36TOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/17/2017", "text": "If I don't eat at any other restaurant during my time in Colorado, I will be okay because this place was the best!  I am temporarily located in Colorado and was out doing some exploring when I began to feel hungry.  I popped onto Yelp to see what restaurants were nearby and this place caught my eye.  It is a little hard to find, tucked away in a shopping plaza behind a larger Mexican restaurant.  I parked my car and went in to the small spot and was able to order right way.  The restaurant smelled delicious and I had a hard time making a selection but I ended up going with the Tagalog Bistec and it was amazing!  So much flavor packed into the meal.  I received a great amount of steak for just over $8 along with 3 egg rolls and some delicious rice.Everyone at the restaurant was super friendly and I can totally see myself becoming a regular here!"}, {"review_id": "bDu_YNazFJRRWJt0V16lkA", "user_id": "d5Zda1xm1OM_REAIuTRCAg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/17/2017", "text": "Love the small cafe feel of this place.  This is family owned and the people here are very friendly .  Being Filipino myself, it is exciting going to a Filipino restaurant that I have never been to before.  Walking into this place is a mix between a filipino fast food and boba place.  Every time I eat at a Filipino restaurant, I always over indulge.  We ordered the Pancit Palabok (Rice Noodles with shrimp and garlic flavored sauce), BBQ Pork and Chicken,  Inihaw na Liempo(Grilled Pork Belly), and Halo-Halo (shaved ice, milk, and different sweet fruits and beans).  All were really good!I can't wait to come back, and I am hoping that I will they will serve Dinuguan  (Pork blood stew) then."}, {"review_id": "Y_vjHcsBfea-q0pXDBpjNw", "user_id": "cUQZEYvjr7w1GLwygovzhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Inexpensive and so delicious!

I think this establishment is family owned and they do such great job at it.  First, we initially wanted to go to a different Filipino place in town but apparently they are on vacation until June.  We drove for another 20 minutes and ended up here fortunately.This restaurant is in a strip mall but don't let that scare you away.  They have awesome Filipino food and the owner is really nice and friendly!I ordered the #2 which came with pancit bihon, a scoop of rice and 3 lumpia.  For $1 more, you can add chicken to your pancit.  I intended on doing that but completely forgot while ordering so I ended up with a vegetarian pancit bihon.  It was OK. Slightly mild as far as the flavors went. And yes, as usual I could have done without the rice.  Dining partner ordered some pork adobo.  He said it wasn't as authentic as the ones he's tried before and I tend to agree.  It did taste a little more fusion.But let me tell you, their halo halo is one of the best I've ever had in the US! And the binignit transported me back in time when I was about 5-7 years old, snot-faced little kid stuffing my face with some delicious binignit and possibly burning my tongue in the process. Mmm... One bite really did the trick for me.This place also has some goldilocks baked goods.  If I lived in Colorado, I would have definitely picked some up for home but unfortunately I won't be home for another 4 days or so.I'm glad the other place didn't work out and we got to try this place.

Unfortunately (or, fortunately, in this case), they were closed on Mondays. So, I Yelped for restaurants in the area, and looked for anything Asian. That's how I ended up at You-Ka. And, oh, how glad I ended up there. The owners were fantastic to visit with, and the Philippine cuisine was authentic (no surprise, since Emi, the owner and chef, is Filipina). I texted my wife the menu items, and we couldn't stop ordering more and more, just to try a variety. We had the Chicken Adobo, Bistek Tagalog, and Asado Siapao. Then for dessert we ordered coconut boba (for fun, they call it Pearl Coolers), Mochi, Ube Puto, Leche Flan, and a packaged Ensavmada with Macapuno.I could go on and on about how great everything was. The only thing we didn't care for so much was the Mochi. It was a bit on the dry side. But, then again, that may be personal preference. And, it shouldn't dilute how great our experience was. We can't wait to dine in, when we can try more dishes, this time hot off the grill.We'll definitely be back.Our only REAL disappointment is that they aren't closer to us on the west side of town!"}, {"review_id": "OYYGXCPNCvlO1X1Paj3nxA", "user_id": "zk9gTiS-W_AZeUqmPnX46g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Excellent change from the typical Colorado Springs chain restaurants.
