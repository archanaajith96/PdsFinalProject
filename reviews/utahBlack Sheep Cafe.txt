Both amazing. Server was super sweet and good at what she does.

The location, right downtown Provo, is awesome, though the parking can be difficult at times (typical Provo). We are always treated warmly by the staff. At my lost recent experience, we ordered the lavender fry bread for an appetizer and WOW! This stuff blew my mind. Did not expect fry bread to be such a stimulating experience. Something you just need to try. The meal was pretty good, the bbq burger was a little messy and a little large for my preference. The cotija fries were tasty but flavor was a little strong for my preference."}, {"review_id": "UfkTiF6Bw-yAi_dGyWcncA", "user_id": "mOYd6rrSHJoZlVjDhiWdsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Loved the food here. What a find! We ravished the honey lavender fry bread. It lives up to the hype. The shrimp and grits is outta this world. Hog howl tacos- wow. Really incredible food and amazing service.

The Honey Lavender app was to die for! Crispy on the outside and nice and perfectly cooked on the inside. The Red Chili Navajo Tacos were excluiste! I expected a spicier sauce, but the heat was excellent! The server was super helpful with what was in the dish and I overheard a different server explaining all the paintings and blown glass chandelier! Very well trained staff, and extremely knowledgeable about everything in the building. The open kitchen was a very nice surprise. The chef and cook were very quick and all the dishes that passed by were very appealing to the eye. It wasn't like other open kitchens were all you hear is the pots and pans and items being dropped. Extremely satisfied with my lunch as well as with the service!"}, {"review_id": "KndDCyPdTafpO4VJdCeq7A", "user_id": "4STmT8A3d-fxhodHMRLAxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I'm not much of a lemonade person, but I tried their cactus pear lemonade drink anyway. I very much enjoyed it. The cafe is known for contemporary Native American cuisine. I've never had Native American cuisine so I honestly can't compare it with the traditional cooking but I asked what the best sellers were. I was told the Navajo tacos so I ordered the green chile pork taco. It's HUUUGE, fyi. Ultimately, it was an amazing foodie experience. I loved the green sauce. I think that's what sold me and the fry bread was so soft. As for the ambience, it's upscale and has some cool art inside."}, {"review_id": "JUNocUVepkqVuwQjxfNuHw", "user_id": "p2sGkKWI7b7EczRlNj6QPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "If you're legitimately looking for 5-Star quality food in Provo, The Black Sheep is undeniably you're place. Their prices are higher than the surrounding restaurants but they deliver on flavor. Their Bison burgers are the BEST I have EVER had. They are fat, juicy, and cooked perfectly pink. The bun they serve it on is soft and marries so well with the burger and house sauces.  During lunch, they serve the burger on a Navajo flatbread which is also tasty, though I prefer the bun.  *Forewarning: their sweet potato fries are more like wedges. I, personally, love the flavor so much, I don't mind that they're plumper and not crispy like regular fries. But if you don't care for that sort of thing, the regular fires are equally seasoned to perfection and crispy to deliciousness. Their hibiscus cactus lemonade is luscious, I even crave it after I leave; nice, subtle, unique flavor. TIP: There is usually a wait here, so if you plan to go, go early, especially during dinner and even lunch hours. Make a reservation if you can. Worth it, because you're going to want to eat here whether you have one or not."}, {"review_id": "t2U8xGWJzmrhPipDVTJlNw", "user_id": "DUbS46vsQQ216TS4unIAFg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The food is great here and the wine is reasonably priced.

We went with a party of 7 people, so we got to try almost everything, and we were not impressed by any of the dishes. I got the beef Navajo tacos, and it wasn't very flavorful at all. The bread ended up being soggy because of all the sauce on top of it, and I was underwhelmed with the flavor. I also got to try out some of the pork jowl nachos, which was my favorite dish here. They were flavorful, and the pork was cooked wonderfully. However, the chips were soggy under all the saucy toppings as well. The posole was also pretty decently flavored, and quite large. It went well with the frybread. I tried some of the buffalo burger & it wasn't anything special. Juicy, but not very flavorful."}, {"review_id": "8EnIF7vrjoyLaa2PWZ---w", "user_id": "3Iw4cxfU-KxP4JRFeoebpA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "I feel like my visit was more of a three star visit but that's because we ordered a burger and pork enchiladas and I think there's better things on the menu. Both entrees were very good. The burger was juicy, slightly sweet, and loaded with arugula which provided a crisp texture and a subtle spice. Way better than iceberg lettuce. The enchiladas were super flavorful. I ordered the bishop as my drink and the flavors were very well balanced.

We are from Arizona, so we appreciate a good jalapeño fix!  They restaurant is cozy and hip at the same time. The staff was friendly and efficient. They recommended the special appetizer of hog jowl nachos.  Those were delicious!  The meat was sweet, tender and flavorful. I had planned to try the hog jowl tacos, but the burgers looked so good that I had to try them. The bison burgers are served with a pretzel bun that is soft with a crisp crust. There are two versions - one with a wine reduction and the other with bacon. Both were fabulous!  They make their own prickly pear lemonade - flavorful and not too sweet. Perfect for us. They offer a nice wine and cocktail menu as well. The fries were awesome - rosemary fries and sweet potato fries. Both hand cut. We were far too stuffed for dessert. I would have given 5 stars, but they left us sitting with our plates for a good 20 minutes after we were done eating. We were all talking, so it wasn't holding us up, but we had to flag someone down eventually to get a box. I would like to come back to try other options!"}, {"review_id": "CX-wsJNW_IvahRmTRIb6_g", "user_id": "3lgvpcQQyRseURPGr62_jw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "My experience may not be the norm but it wasn't the greatest. First of all the waiter was very gracious and accommodating which was great. He brought out the appetizer which was fries with some topping (can't remember the name). They came out cold. So someone in our party sent them back. The second tune they came out they were gross. When fries aren't prepared properly they taste awful. So they were sent back a second time. The third time they were delicious. As annoying as it was to not get it right until the third time the fries were delicious and the sauces they use went very well. I got the prickly pear lemonade. Not impressed. It tastes like they opened a can of regular pink lemonade, poured it in a glass then changed the name to something more fancy. There is a small menu (which is good) but there is a lot of pork options. It'd be good to see a little more diversity. I got the chimichanga. It came with rice and beans. The chimi was good the pork is flavored very well but it's not much better than something you can get at a dive Mexican shop for 7 bucks. The rice isssss well rice. It wasn't bad it wasn't good. It's hard to screw up rice. The beans however were salty. Like really salty. The main course is definitely not worth the 20 dollar price tag. I've heard that this place is amazing but honestly I didn't really see it. I probably won't be back."}, {"review_id": "Og6xmcxeGoUUW77ARYZllg", "user_id": "02diHSEWeqMWWbXfgJwVlg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "I got the g.o.a.t. Burger.
