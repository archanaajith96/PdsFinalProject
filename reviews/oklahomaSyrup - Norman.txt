The people are so friendly and accommodating! They helped me celebrate my birthday, accommodated for a fairly large party on a Sunday morning, and do it all with a smile!The food is delicious! I love their pancakes which have a unique sweetness to them and their potatoes are amazing! Even their eggs and sausage are somehow better than other breakfast places!I always get the Nompton but I have seen people get the Morning Glory, Sliders, and even what looked like breakfast tacos! Everything they have looks delicious and I love that you can add things like strawberries and chocolate chips on to your pancakes. Their coffee is delicious and their barista is talented! This is all made even more wonderful when you find out they are operated by people who go to a church here in Norman and were missionaries abroad. This restaurant has delicious food and a heart for social and community impact! They are changing the game!"}, {"review_id": "Nn9zbuGs7D8IvZsqq2aVOA", "user_id": "6YrVTPE3YjX5GMBTFCCyRA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I wasn't too impressed with Syrup. Came mid morning which is a busy time for any restaurant that serves breakfast. After waiting 45 minutes we were seated.Seating reminds me of New York City where restaurants don't have much room so they sit everyone on top of each other. The people next to us who we were literally rubbing elbows with were loud talkers. This would interrupt the conversation I was trying to have.Food got here and the potatoes had been sitting a long time. They were dry and very hard. My wife's bacon was burnt to a crisp. Waiter was nice and brought her replacements right away. I go by the rule if it's wrong the first time I never send it back. I've had much better around Norman. Perhaps a quiet day would produce better food."}, {"review_id": "lLbfH7XB1LtH8loCXNMpiw", "user_id": "_0wHmzdLjIEWz9ngaJfmmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Very good local place to go for breakfast.

The space is small and can fill up quick! I imagine this place can get long lines but I came prepared and went early. The tables are close together and I don't care for that sort of thing but I get it, they need to add as much seating as possible. The wood tables are gorgeous, I just wish we were one of the lucky ones who got to sit on the amazing yellow couch. The service here is phenomenal! We had a waiter and waitress help us and both were joyful, attentive, and made us feel right at home.The food here is good. I'd probably give it 3 to 3.5 stars but the prices are just right. I didn't see anything over $10 which is perfect for breakfast. They have decently priced coffee as well. They serve all of their drinks (besides coffee) in mason jars which only adds to the charm. I read a review that said the water is terrible here but this is actually one of few places in Norman where the water seemed filtered and tasted amazing. Maybe they've changed their ways from previously. If you're looking for mimosas or bloody Mary's you've come to the wrong place. This is a dry breakfast/brunch place unfortunately. But if you're looking for vegan options, you've picked right. Syrup has vegan donuts! So there's something to satisfy everyone.Bottom line: lots of charm, great people, good food, delicious coffee, and very cozy!"}, {"review_id": "MeYA8UExdgknYIFH7zvxaA", "user_id": "fYPVISf8dIROSV4mqEdq1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "My husband and I ate here today for brunch and it was so good! We just moved here from Portland, OR and they had some of our favorites on the menu like stumptown coffee and tillamook cheese. It felt a little like home. I'm gluten free and they have gluten free pancakes! It's so hard to find good gluten free food and they did an awesome job with the pancakes. My husband got the nomptom and ate everything. He really liked it. I also got a fruit bowl and it had strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries in it. I was expecting filler fruits so that was a nice surprise. The wait for shorter than an expected. Overall I would highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "TLfdZJ8Q1eaOji6yGdnfgA", "user_id": "g9Go598hrayxNBmSt68wRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This is my second time here.

I've heard they are always busy, especially on weekends so I was expecting a wait. They told us 30 minutes, it ended being 50 minutes. We had to wait in our cars because of how packed it was inside. No biggie though since we probably should have called to make a reservation, if they even take them.Having lived in Norman for a few years, I know how nasty the water gets sometimes. But Syrup had some of the worst water I've tasted in my life. So nasty most of my friends and I ordered another drink because we didn't want to drink the water. If this is some marketing strategy, then Syrup is genius. I went with the Huevos Rancheros. Nothing crazy about it. I ordered my eggs sunny side up but the white albumen part had several runny, snot-like pieces. Maybe I should have asked for over easy, but the albumen is usually cooked when I've gotten sunny side up from other places. I'll let it go though since that might have been my fault for ordering it.The tortillas were extremely hard to cut through. The potatoes didn't have much seasoning to it. The beans were pretty good and provided much needed flavor. Overall, I wasn't a big fan of it though. I think prices are fair for a trendy, hipster brunch place like this. Servings should be larger though for what you're paying. The wait is almost always guaranteed but might be worth it. I may try the new OKC location but probably won't return to this one due to the nasty water and busy area."}, {"review_id": "PYFUd9t1YLNUz_jqQ7ogMA", "user_id": "-EjteXrl-1RqgpGo9wGqIQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "I enjoyed a very good breakfast this Sunday morning at Syrup in Norman. My friend and I walked in around 9:45 am and were seated right away. They have two-top tables right by the door, at which we were seated, so it got a little cold when the door was held open every 5 minutes. No biggie, though. I had a drip coffee (Stumptown yessssss) and my friend had a jasmine tea. I ordered the Eggs Benedict. The waiter said the eggs would be poached \"medium,\" which I would say they definitely were not. I love a good runny yolk, but the whites were also very runny and mucus-y....not medium in my personal opinion. Otherwise the meal was very tasty and not too expensive - $14 for coffee and an entree. I saw several meals that looked really delicious. Our waiter, Tas, was great. I will definitely be back, maybe at the OKC location, to try more (esp the biscuit and gravy with sausage!)"}, {"review_id": "_tNEhmXYIsAV2ozgl1WwYg", "user_id": "kz6HzZFR-L4TshHLrWf0Vw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "The restaurant is super cute and quaint but gets crowded fast. The tables along the wall by the door are SUPER close together. I know, most brunch places are for some reason but they need a bigger place or not have it as clustered. I'd suffer through longer wait times for personal space. Close like, when I got up to go to the bathroom I was so scared my butt was going to brush the next tables food. The service was fine. Everyone was really friendly. The food was fine, just nothing to rave about. The potatoes were subpar, just bland really. Didn't taste like breakfast potatoes. I ordered the Morning Glory.

They have French press and drip coffee and as an avid coffee drinker I'm actually good with either one! They are both robust in flavor!

The restaurant is set up bad. Tables are so close to each other that you could elbow your neighbors. At one point, our waitresses ass was in my face because she would stand in the middle to take the other tables order... Ordered two cold brews with milk. It had no coffee flavor  and tasted like Greek yogurt. We ask the waitress for another one without milk thinking it was a bad batch... The waitress apologizes says she put 1% instead of 2% because she was being lazy.... I'm sitting there hoping she didn't use expired milk or something. She brings out another cold brew with no milk and to our surprise the coffee was also very sour tasting. Which means it was made bad or was old. The food was nothing to run home about. It may have had a better taste in my mouth if the restaurant wasn't set up so terribly and gave me a better experience.

I drank a salted caramel latte and it was great that I've been adding salt to my coffee at home. Great idea! My partner had the eggs Benedict and he loved it.

Sort of modern rustic classic new age casual fancy thing going on. The menu was just big enough to not be a handful. They had classics everyone loves all the way to really special plates.

Great mix between sweet and savory. Great service here, really clean, and not terribly crowded on a weekend.
