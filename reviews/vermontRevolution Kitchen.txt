Mainly bcs I love \"gourmet\" vegetarian dining, and it's not easy to come by where I live. But you can have a niche dining market and still miss the mark, you know? Luckily Revolution Kitchen delivers!First, let me get logistics out of the way: MAKE RESERVATIONS. This place is popular. We ended up sitting at the bar because--no joke--it was almost a FOUR hour wait otherwise. And that bar is small and cramped my friend. And right by the door, so enjoy lots of people walking in right behind you, bringing in cold air and grumbles when they realize they don't have reservations either. So yeah, call ahead. Because it was still worth it. Our server was super nice and cool. Made good beer recommendations and let me try a sample before I got a pint. Food recommendations were spot on too. Sometimes you ask a server what they recommend, and they hem and haw. This guy actually gave an opinion (although I'm confident everything would have been good) and I'm so glad I listened to him!We got the Brussels sprouts app, which was not as crispy as I usually like my Brussels sprouts, but made up for it with a miso glaze that I was literally licking off my fingers. Also got the seitan satay app, which was mind-blowing. Soooo crispy and sticky and good. omg. Joe got the fig and goat cheese wontons app for his dinner (I don't do figs. An animal dies to make them. Look it up.) He said they were awesome. Crispy and packed with filling. His only comment would have been more figginess. I got the seitan cutlets, which were basically the same as the satay, but cooked in this decadent lemon wine caper sauce and served on mashed potatoes. Oh man. It felt like a real dinner, you know? Sometimes going out as a vegetarian, you're like, \"hoorah. a black bean burger. oh good. more pasta. an entree sized salad? be still my beating taste buds.\" To actually get something flavorful and gourmet and made with so much care and attention? Just awesome. Desserts were grand, although honestly not nearly the highlight of the meal. We got the maple cake, which was a little bit dry, but not overly sweet, which is a big risk with maple (like I'm going to talk about baking with maple syrup while reviewing a freaking Vermont restaurant). We also got the coconut cream pie, which we both preferred a bit. Again, not overly sweet, and a really excellent, natural coconut flavor. On a chocolate cookie crust. Heck yeah!Two beers, three apps, one entree, and two desserts came to $92 with tax. Considering alcohol and dessert are involved, I think $45 a person is pretty reasonable. And completely worth it."}, {"review_id": "nrMUnubE67HAoYy8zUxpbA", "user_id": "cWNF5_Tl7dtMHcPqo6ljZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "There is no need to be vegetarian or vegan to love this restaurant but if you are, the search for gourmet food is over! I had dinner there last night and it was absolutely wonderful. I was by myself and new to the restaurant and decided to try it based on a friend's recommendation. I had a fabulous curry, shaved fennel and asparagus salad, and coconut cream pie for dessert. It's a young, hip place and a little noisy but the service and atmosphere was warm and welcoming. I'm going back tonight with a friend.

Lots of tempting choices on the menu (all veg/vegan). We shared tasty Brussels sprouts and enjoyed ravioli, pad thai, and noodle hot pot entrees. Somehow we still had room to sample slices of cream pies. Wonderful. The room seemed a little loud as we sat down, but didn't disturb our conversation between bites.

We walked in at 7:45pm on a Friday. We waited for about a half an hour before getting a table. There is a bar at the entrance, so it was easy to have a glass of wine while we waited. My partner is gluten free and i'm vegetarian so this place was basically made for us! I had the delicious Seitan Picatta and my partner had the revolution tacos. We also ordered the brussel sprouts because we were quite hungry by the time we got a table. Everything was delicious, the server, hostess, and chef were all attebtive and appeeciative of our business. We took a piece of gf and vegan coconut cream pie to go. It's amazing!"}, {"review_id": "soMoa2ogGY2W9lHy0oFnQA", "user_id": "7xsdYt90Hqp-Ca9ruXe0uw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Fantastic dinner, the staff is friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is really fun.

It was extremely busy! We waited about an hour and a half and people who came after - who did not have reservations - were seated before us. I confronted our server and they were prompt to correct their mistake. They even gave us a free spring roll while we were waiting and coconut cream pie at the end of our meal on the house. The food was good, not on par with vegan/vegetarian restaurants in a place like LA, but I'll take what I can get in Vermont. I'd go back again."}, {"review_id": "5VFXdioaQZJx2kTykWBSBA", "user_id": "cTwbGcPiU0Un7y1fng4ZCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I checked Revolution Kitchen out on a trip to Burlington months ago and can't get the maple cake out of my head. The restaurant came highly recommended from several locals and did not disappoint. Every course was so flavorful and felt like an indulgence.

Their desserts are amazing. Their cake is to die for. Seitan piccata is also very good. I've never had anything that's tasted bad. Very nicely decorated, although a bit dark. You can barely read the menu in there, but hey, maybe that's the ambiance they're going for and I'm just not cultured. Lol. Service is great, I've never had a complaint there. If they make a mistake, they fix it quickly, and they're all super nice. Prices are very very high. High enough to where I can only go on very special occasions. Makes me sad because the food is really good, but I can't ever leave without spending 80 dollars on just dinner for my boyfriend and I. 25 dollars for an entree just seems a bit ridiculous, no matter how good the food. Overall, I love this place. Just wish I could go more."}, {"review_id": "GTb9bvS-iVLi3ppWgM23Sg", "user_id": "0B1sVLjtqIQZ8ceOMw9iag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "I loved this place - went here twice in a short visit to Burlington.

I loved the dim lights and the overall ambiance. Caesar salad was super fresh. They had cauliflower in place of their Brussels sprouts because cauliflower is in season. It was good, but hubby loved it more (I would have liked the Brussel sprouts - personal preference). I had a special, which consisted of rice noodles with veggies and tofu in a sweet and spicy broth and hubby had the stir fry with rice, tofu and veggies - both were great. The best part were the desserts. We had their award winning vanilla maple cake and another vanilla coconut cake, both gluten free (hard to believe!). It was the best and most unique gluten free vegan dessert I ever had - sweet, but not too sweet, moist and just delish!"}, {"review_id": "IUrQc1usTBIQXyhxCGnojA", "user_id": "zxy9RNkt3yU04u8n9qUiAg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Revolution Kitchen was a recommended place for us to stop at while we were having a weekend away in Shelburne Vermont. we didn't realize that you needed a reservation in order to eat there, so when we initially showed up, we were told it would be a two hour wait. we decided to put  our names down and went back a little later. the restaurant was full when we were seated. our waiter was great, our food was . . . eh. i got the Revolution Tacos and my boyfriend got the Poblano and Seitan Fajitas. we sampled each others and thought each dish was good, but not great, especially considering the cost. the individual ingredients in the tacos were as tasty as they should be, but there was nothing in the taco to unify the flavors. all-in-all a small plate of not bad, but kinda boring food. the fajitas were slightly more flavorful, but nothing to write home about.  the star of the meal was the Benito's bottle of hot sauce that was on the table, which we each ended up enjoying on our meals. the ambience at Revolution Kitchen was \"hip\". the dining room was very lowly lit, almost to the point of being too dark to see your food, but not quite. there was some really great artwork on the walls which may or may not have been a temporary exhibition. final thought, if you want to chill with a good beer and a mediocre meal you won't mind spending a little extra money for in order to have it in a chill spot with a bunch of other chill diners, then check out Revolution Kitchen if you're in the Burlington area. just make sure you make a reservation first."}, {"review_id": "vmZeLDQ7ojriaBL0QMRAOA", "user_id": "l1AImGOjZ6rlxiORu1cdzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "This could be the best vegan food I've ever had and I didn't have to feel like an ass for being gluten free too!
