I stop in to the deli a few times a few times a month, and their restaurant probably once a month. I love their garbanzo bean salads, and all the combinations of root veggies. I love their gluten-free breads as well. Be sure to try their breakfast cookies! Also, I think my favorite entree is the corned beef hash. I'm addicted!Don't leave without trying Marie's Turkish coffee! It's the best in the City!The service is wonderful and personable. Plan ahead so that parking is not a problem; just plan to park on a side street if you don't find a spot behind the restaurant. Believe me! It's well worth the tiny inconvenience. Enjoy Marie's and give yourself lots of time for a leisurely visit with a friend. You'll love it!"}, {"review_id": "t_jAfP9lIhsIUhm8Vf1gGQ", "user_id": "aKKKwUtY_pDv9jAtacYmdA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I moved to Grand Rapids a couple months ago and became aware that it was almost criminal that I hadn't tried Marie Catrib's. It was a positive experience and I can understand the appeal. Good food, done right. My husband and I came in at about 1pm on a weekday and the place was hopping, and we had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. We had Turkish coffee for the first time and it was really enjoyable - it alone made the visit worth it. I had the trenton and my husband had the brisket and they were both pretty tasty. Service was also friendly and quick.The two downsides are the cramped quarters and slightly high prices. You do kind of feel like you're sat on top of one another and because it's packed even more so. I also thought the prices were a tad steep. Nothing ridiculous, but a little high for what it is.All in all, I'm glad I tried this place. If I were hungry and in the neighborhood, I wouldn't hesitate to come back."}, {"review_id": "XBOXQKXc0YpPuYDDwrh21A", "user_id": "MbALxKf-5suDxRtq-xtA4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "The long wait time here is much warranted because the food is fantastic. We waited about an hour on a busy Saturday brunch. Parking was pretty difficult to find some they have a tiny lot in the back. We parked a couple blocks away in the residential area and walked over. We ordered the half pot of the Turkish coffee, the portobello sandwich, and a shawarma. It was our first time trying Turkish coffee. The coffee comes out dark but very smooth, thick, and sweet. I loved the sweet spices and the novelty way of pouring the cups! The portobello sandwich here is simply perfection. All the ingredients in the sandwich came together so well that it melted in my mouth and I couldn't stop myself from eating it so quickly! The shawarma was also quite delicious, but didn't blow me out of the park like the portobello mushroom did. I have to say this is probably one of the best Mediterranean places I've tried by far!"}, {"review_id": "UtHUiJKQE0hSUS-5nHJlJQ", "user_id": "YgYYfZ4ZkWecFVXjsQ9iqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Cannot miss on Marie's.

Best portobello mushroom sandwich I have ever had. Fantastic service and front of house with a chill hip vibe. Definitely coming back.As you make your way through the small parking lot in the back or surrounding street parking to the store, you are greeted with helpful friendly service. There is a Delicatessen for take home on the street side of the restaurant and the in house sitting on the parking lot side. There is a sign in sheet and a bit of a wait but well worth it. The Porto, is a fully loaded sandwich with deep flavors and a almost sweet taste to the marinated portobello mushrooms, grilled/ caramelized onions, a generous helping of melted stringy provolone cheese, fresh tomatoes and basil, all placed between a delicious grilled challah bread. A beautiful harmony of flavors. Highly recommended. Overall super solid spot, with great environment and staff and best portobello mushroom sandwich I have ever had. ***Try the Turkish coffee, rich smooth bold flavors of sweeten unfiltered coffee with deep notes of cardamom."}, {"review_id": "mEcXEX-raJuTgJjuzRwfUA", "user_id": "i5P9TKpmgH8DEnXXOwr7IA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "The Larry David was awesome!  The flavor balance was incredibly good.  We also tried the Sweet Potato Quinoa burger, and it was great too, with a very nice curry type spice.

Two words? Modern retro! Lol. I had the Reuben which can come with corned beef (traditional), chicken, turkey, or tofu! I was thrilled to see a tofu option!! These people have recreated the Reuben!! Everywhere I've ever gone a Reuben is a Reuben and none are ever set apart from the rest. Not so at Marie Catrib's!! There was a beautifully fried slice of tofu, seasoned with some amazing Mediterranean flavors like cumin, garlic, and I'm betting some turmeric to say the least. There were fried red onions which gave a beautiful sweetness with the tang of the kraut, and a one of a kind sauce that matched very well. I would come back just for this sandwich!! My husband had a salmon sandwich that was also very good. He only mentioned, he would've liked thinner bread and more salmon. The sandwiches were huge and certainly enough to fill a belly. The service was exceptional and it appears I hit the establishment at just the right time. I didn't have to wait to be seated and our food was served fast and hot. However, I saw chef mic hard at work and the scalding hot sandwich confirms the reheated ingredients. I would still return and apparently around 3/4 pm on a Wednesday is perfect."}, {"review_id": "d8AvABR4N3HaxDDvhqJ-6g", "user_id": "XDT3T1krAKE9Bh04j0pq3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Perfectly sized portions, hip atmosphere, quite expensive.I've visited 3 times now and have had great experiences each time. The first portion of the review focuses on the food. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful and local when available. The flavoring of the dishes is great, with the skillets and sandwiches balancing the starches with the meat very well and just the right amount of vegetables to compliment the heavier components of the dish. The seasoned potatoes are an excellent companion piece to eggs, meats, and sandwiches alike. The atmosphere is friendly and invited. The seating area is very tight, with seats being very close to each other, but once you're seated the servers keep the coffee and drinks flowing. The only drawbacks happen to be the long wait times and the prices. The wait times are to be expected when the food is as good as it is, and that is not necessarily a reason not to go. There is a small waiting area in the deli area that many seem to forgo in favor of the tight hallway at the north entrance. You can grab a cup of coffee while you're waiting too. In my opinion, the pricing is a little steep; however, it is worth going there at least once regardless of price and wait time to experience the food and atmosphere Marie Catrib's has to offer."}, {"review_id": "nBfTc3hpuBNPP421bu2Eaw", "user_id": "vFeB4lXsZN5-lEqOrIc_Uw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "There is so much that is so good here.

While you are thinking about peanut sauce, order the peanut noodles. It comes mixed with broccoli and is excellent. My daughter had the Hot and Sassy, it tasted like breakfast at a cottage in the woods, smoky, sweet and delicious.

Came here with a party of 5 on a Friday morning around 10am and we were seated immediately. They had Turkish coffee on their menu so we decided to order a pot for our table. It took probably 15min until we got our pot. Now I don't know if that is just because Turkish coffee takes a while to brew or if our server forgot about us. Once the coffee did arrive though it was amazing. Not bitter at all, but instead sweet. The coffee grinds are still in the coffee but they dissolve in your mouth and you don't even notice that they are their until you look at true bottom of your cup to see the grinds. I ordered the sweet potato pancakes which came in a stack of 3 with a side of syrup and a single strawberry. I love anything and everything sweet potato and these did not disappoint. They were not super sweet and had a good texture. I do wish however that the pancakes came with a jam or something that I could've spread on instead of the syrup. I also tasted the house potatoes and those are probably one of the best potatoes I've ever had. They had a little bit of spice to them and a nice crunch. 4 stars because the sweet potato pancakes were very good, but missing something and I'm not quite sure what. The Turkish coffee took a long time to get to our table but once it arrived it was delicious."}, {"review_id": "rc9_kqv9fzcIUFF571SUjQ", "user_id": "dWlcWkLOfthBYBkDyf1C_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Always AMAZING!
