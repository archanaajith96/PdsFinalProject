The toast was generously proportioned, and had a great texture. It was crispy without being too dry. The Five West omelet with smoked pork was very indulgent. It was a large enough serving for 3 people. The hash browns were extra crispy!Service was great, our waitress attentive without being pushy. A word about their dinner service. On a previous visit, we shared their fried chicken lettuce wraps, which were incredibly good. The chicken was tender and moist, and went perfectly with the crispy fresh lettuce. The peanut sauce was rich, and made for a delicious appetizer.The BBQ short rib pizza is incredible! It is very indulgent, not for the faint at heart or calorically conscious. I had the honey and lime shrimp salad, which was a miss for me. The combination and quinoa and lettuce made for an odd texture. The dressing was avocado based, but because the flavor of avocado is mild, it lacked a bit of identity. I wouldn't order it again, there seemed to be plenty of other options on the menu."}, {"review_id": "ADlbXka7Go-2na9_bkTDYw", "user_id": "ryt0GszEzZFi6yLlAH_pKA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Nachos, Nachos, Nachos! I will forever remember Five West for the absolute biggest plate of nachos I have seen in my life!We were staying in Rochester for the evening and our hotel was just up the street from Five West so we thought we would have some dinner. They have a nice patio area outside when the weather is warmer and the inside is really big and open. Lots of TV's surround the restaurant.I deviated from my usual burger order as the blackened chicken avocado melt sounded really good this evening. My wife was not too hungry so she ordered a bowl of the smoked chicken gouda wild rice soup. We thought we would also try some nachos. Well the nachos came out quickly and they could have been delivered on a flat bed truck. My pictures won't do this an justice as this plate was huge. Full of crispy chips, melted cheese and all the goodies. Getting hungrier as we were eating we worked on these for what seemed like a long time only to notice we had hardly put a dent in them. I am one who DOES NOT like to waste food but this was going to be have to be one of those times. Our meals followed shortly after we were getting stuffed on those nachos. My blackened chicken avocado melt was excellent. The chicken was juicy and had a nice seasoning from the blackening spice. The avocado creamy and was a perfect balance. The smoked chicken gouda wild rice was also excellent. Big chunks of chicken, the smoky flavor and gouda provided a different flavor profile than the typical chicken wild rice soup. Would definitely order both of these again. Since we were only going to be in town for the evening we did take a huge pile of nachos with us to. We tried to snack on them during the evening however eventually the pile of nachos won out and we had to toss them. We did put in a good effort. Very good nachos and good food. One of the better places that we have eaten at in Rochester!"}, {"review_id": "_UJT_wYRkdK31YhLXgyvlw", "user_id": "ESS_wCwpKz3WwpMdFl8Bkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Excellent place, love the nachos, you get a ton and the service is always so friendly and helpful.

This is our second time coming and the food somehow seemed to get even better. We love love love the cinnamon French toast (tip, ask for extra Crème Anglaise). My husband particularly loves the breakfast burrito (we sub chicken for the sausage and bacon). It reminded us of the burritos we had in SoCal, which is where we lived for several years. Top it off with Cholula and that is a delish burrito. The service is also consistently great.We come here on our way back from visiting the Mayo.

We also got a s'mores waffle for the table and the kids really liked that.   Biscuits n gravy...thin but taste gravy n the biscuits were very petite but flakey n full of flavor! Corned beef hash is not your normal hash.  Big chunks of corned beef (not minced) with tons of big chunks of veggies n eggs your way.  NY stripe n eggs...ordered med rare but came a little more on the rare side. Our server Jake was fantastic!!!  Would have loved to go back n try more off the menu but we were leaving that afternoon.  But if ever in Rochester MN again, we will bed be back!"}, {"review_id": "4xRb_UxiuBMk7388LdlBgg", "user_id": "iOIVkS-xEpYnLQyRWFB6Xg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/27/2017", "text": "Very impressed with the setup of this bar/restaurant. I have avoided this spot thinking it was a little speedy for my liking. Discovered today it is comparable in cost to the rest of the areas restaurants. Upon entering I noticed an extremely large patio area. Including an outdoor bar with a large line of TV's (love this). Family friendly indoor and outdoor. Really nice design and setup. We had the blackened chicken salad and chicken nachos. The nachos were missing the heat I was looking for (Jalapeño) style heat on it. The salad I sampled a bit of and it was good. The location does take reservations and apparently has a great Sunday brunch. We are stopping out for brunch tomorrow.

Boy am I sure glad we did!!I cannot recall everything we had during our March visits, yes we loved this place so much we actually ate there two nights in a row!! But I know on one visit we the Buffalo Chicken Wonton appetizer and it so good!! We also had this in June and both times we ate everything on the plate. Even the coleslaw they garnish the plate with. One of my entrees in March was Steak Fettuccine, a blackened filet in a delicious red pepper and red wine demi-glaze with portabella mushroom and spinach. Unfortunately, I cannot recall what my wife had and their menu changed right before our June visit so I can't jog my memory.Now, my meal in June was simply unforgettable!! They added a section of steaks to their menu and it was probably the best thing they could have done. Most of the steaks are dry aged with one being wet aged (the NY strip if I remember correctly). Quoting Harry Carrey, HOLY COW, that was a good steak! And yes pun intended. I will let the before and after pictures tell the rest of the story. The restaurant is very cool and has a huge patio. The best thing for us and one of the reasons we even chose this place is that it is NOT in downtown. The service was excellent and the cocktails we had were wonderful. Especially, \"TIS' THE SANGRIA\".We have to go back in December and we have a little dilemma. Due to the success of my wife's treatment in March it is probably only going to be a one night stay and come back the next day after the appointment. We have to figure out how early we need to leave Omaha in order to get to Five West and have dinner before going to our hotel."}, {"review_id": "Rhds8AzT6PlYn0QdXdXNLQ", "user_id": "nc7tFLC7SyIul8KoxXLrbA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Beware they charge you for extra nugget sauce!!!

Ordered off the lunch menu but pleased to see breakfast is available until 1 on Saturdays. They were fairly busy, not unexpected; the place always looks crowded when we drive by on our way to Costco. We ordered the queso appetizer, beer battered cod sandwich, honey lime shrimp salad, and fish tacos. Our server was very helpful with the ordering process as we had some questions about the seasonings (sharing food with kids/babies). Food came out in a timely fashion staring with the app. It was impressively served with more than enough seasoned tortilla chips and was enjoyed by all. There's a ton of chorizo but most of it was on the bottom so stir everything up before eating forBest results. This would be great for a larger group (we had three people) because there was plenty!  Would definitely order it again.  Shrimp salad was large and came with three big shrimp. I'm not sure how I feel about that, the three shrimp. Made it kind of hard to share a taste with others but it didn't seem to be short on shrimp when all was said and done, I wouldn't complain if there were more though, you kind of have to ration the shrimp or you'll be left with just the lettuce. There is quinoa mixed in so you're still getting a good protein dose. The dressing was tasty but not memorable. Would probably not order this again until I've had a chance to try everything else on the menu. Fish tacos came served with black beans and rice. They were lukewarm when they got to the table, almost cold so I was confused about what temperature they were actually supposed to be. I was feeding them to my baby so I didn't mind the lack of warmth but I probably wouldn't have enjoyed them as a side. The fish was blackened and served with a spicy aioli so the tacos were pretty zingy and tasty. My only complaint about about the tacos themselves is they were a bit too salty. I'd order again in a pinch, with a different side. Cod sandwich was the winner. I could smell the beer before I made mouth contact, the temperature was perfectly steamy beneath the crisp beer batter, and the toppings and condiments complimented while not overwhelming. It was served with garlic fries that were enjoyed by all.  Would certainly order this again, I think all three of us agree on that. The service was great with the exception being that drinks were not refilled until requested (and empty). We will be back, and that's something we don't say much in this city."}, {"review_id": "35mYQGNLW5EeRYaewnCDxA", "user_id": "rWk19AwMYywEXM6amZBp1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "We were there for Sunday lunch brunch and we were impressed with the bright well lit space.
