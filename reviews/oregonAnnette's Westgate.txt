The bacon was a little chewy, but it was thick bacon. Tons of onion, which is good for me cause I like onions. I thought it was a tad spendy, but I knew that going in.Fries: I just got the house fries (and they have a lot to choose from), they were pretty good, not overly salty, taste a hint of seasoning.Service: the service started out good, and yes I'm dining alone, and near the end I just felt pressured to finish fast and get out of there instead of taking my time, so instead of finishing my food i ended up taking it home, I didn't liked that. But my waiter was good at filling my water glass the whole time, I didn't sit long before my order was taken, food came out fast.Overall: the food was awesome, I was not a fan of the service. But overall It was good, tad spendy for my taste. But I've been here a few times mostly for breakfast and the food has always been amazing!"}, {"review_id": "ebQ6JEG4ZNWXJfo8dULEgA", "user_id": "0BUGVoSN0ZkdUh9Zodfjnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Love Annette's.

Over half left over as well.

My children love their chocolate chip pancakes and their griddles are delicious. My spouse usually gets the French toast.Tonight since we were there after work we ventured into a different portion of the menu. I wish I hadn't. I got the Prawns and Prime. The prawns were sautéed in white wine and unfortunately they did not cook off the wine. The prime rib was cooked perfectly. My spouse ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes. Overall the CFS was cooked appropriately and had good flavor. Probably the biggest hit of the night was their clam chowder - large pieces of bacon with a thick creamy texture and was not overpowering in clam flavor - all the flavors married well together and none stole the show.If we all would have ordered or usual breakfast fare, they would have earned their 5th star."}, {"review_id": "NfbGlanWOLvNr6gB8a_XRw", "user_id": "lnyeFdUGd-zOOtKcM-XwOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "I just tried this establishment today, and I was pleased with the service and quality.

There is always a great variety of bommmb desserts, usually we are too full but still take some to go because temptation wins!

It's not like we couldn't pay our mortgage or something because of it, but the bill was definitely more than we usually spend on a meal--because this was supposed to be a gift, right??  And my grandmother is well off enough to give this kind of gift--and totally a stand up lady. She'll be 95 on her next birthday, she's not out to scam anyone.On one hand, I understand that it's a little unfair to ask them to take us at our word.  On the other hand, I do think that a good compromise would have been \"ok, your gift card doesn't work and you aren't going to get the full amount from it, but we will comp your meal.\"The piece that led me to write this review is that the manager told my husband he would look through old receipts to see if he could find anything--and would give my husband a call back early in the week.  It has now been a full week and we have heard NOTHING.This was kind of an embarrassing experience for us, even though it was in no way our fault.  I won't be back.  Which is a huge bummer because I've heard their breakfast is awesome and I love a good breakfast."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/annettes-westgate-salem?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
