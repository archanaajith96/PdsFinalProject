My wife and I are on vacation and stopped here for lunch. I had the bacon cheese burger and fries. I feel like now I will be planning ways to come back! That was easily the best burger I've had since my transition, but it may have been the best tasting burger I've had in my life. And I am pretty sure I will be dreaming about those fries tonight. So crispy, and whatever seasonings y'all put on it! Who needs ketchup? I can eat those things by themselves! The only down side to this place is the parking. It's extremely limited and crammed. But the people are so friendly, and the food more than made up for it!Thank you for a fantastic lunch!  I hope to be back one day!"}, {"review_id": "pMiOmD3ma4RbDslPsLCQZw", "user_id": "xtLLAyX8jrwW56WqWkAHfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "This place almost convinced me to go vegan! It is located on Main Street in downtown Columbia. It has a very African vibe to it and they sell very nice artwork from local artists in there. Their entire menu is vegan.When I arrived, the ladies who were working were very polite and very helpful and answered all questions that I had about the menu (which changes daily).  I ordered the spare ribs, purple cabbage, and curry potatoes. The meal came with rice. I believe the total for this dinner was $11. The spareribs are to die for. They taste like actual meat, and the barbecue sauce was great. I have never had purple cabbage before until today but it was very good, and I will definitely order more at a later time. The cabbage had somewhat of a sweet aftertaste. The curry potatoes were ok. It had a lot of flavor but not enough spice for my liking, and it almost had a cheese taste... but it was good. The brown rice was good as well. For a drink, I got the blackberry limeade, and this may have been the best drink I have ever had in my life. It was sweet but not too sweet and it had just the right amount of tart. The drink costs about $3. I wanted to try a vegan cupcake, but I don't know about spending $5 on one cupcake that may or may not be good. I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant."}, {"review_id": "uVAbu3rquXaE9Epypz5uaQ", "user_id": "osYJaXyIjy3uxCU89Lv9Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Just wow! They came to a vegan festival here in Charleston and I'm so glad I went. They were the best food vendor by far! Everything was so good! I wish I tried the juices but I know will have to go to Columbia to try out more options! I got to the festival relatively early and they had already ran out of the \"chicken\"! That's how you know a place has good food! I can't wait to try them again!

So much love and nourishment put into the food that you can taste it in every bite. Today I had \"Bbq Spare Ribs\" over rice with Mac N Cheese, collards, and Curry Coconut Chickpeas! An absolutely AMAZING meal to give me good energy and a full stomach without being too full. I always make sure to stop by at least once a week. Also love the hospitality that is given from every sister and brother that works there.

Thank you Yelp! After a long road trip of less than healthy food, this was a welcomed sight!We had pretty much all of their sides, and the daily protein done up BBQ style. The collards were my favorite.. spicy too! Also enjoyed the curry potatoes, the Mac and spices in a creamy cheese like sauce, lentils, yams, and red cabbage. Everything was perfectly delicious.... so much so that we're saving the great looking kale salad for later.This is a new stop for us on our long road trips... looking forward to returning soon!"}, {"review_id": "_BHE9_VvSxtCCzLj_3XbiA", "user_id": "5-0xiR1nFBIQhRDOQfEMPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Nothing but good experiences here!

I found this place online while searching for local vegetarian/vegan restaurants. What a treat it was to come across this \"Mom & Pop\" restaurant!! Has the \"make yourself at home\" appeal. The food is spiced to perfection. EXPLODING with flavor. Tastes like food grandma would make, except much healthier. I had the four veggie plate, and didn't miss the taste of cheese or meat at all!! Definitely the best Mac and \"Cheese\" I've had. Couldn't even finish my plate from being full. If you think you couldn't possibly be vegan, this place will prove you wrong! Great food, great people, great laid back atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "JGEXMHFTId25mZ7HpI9L4Q", "user_id": "NbLndmHX4J6k6X5Ng3OaoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "My first time here, and it's delicious. Quick service, nice people Why is this my first time?!?? If you haven't been, it's time to go. Vegan soul food, who would have thought? Very chill vibes in here. They're playing Kanye uncensored so I like that. Cool place for Columbia, glad to find it. African-art-filled eatery for vegan soul food, including sandwiches. Great for solo eating @ lunch with specials. I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "zGN_mLHvk_JknT97oLRLxg", "user_id": "gFR15h-i_s8CZLQRF2NnSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Just the best! Last night, I got the large protein plate. The protein yesterday was BBQ \"spare ribs\". The protein comes on a bed of brown rice, and the large plate comes with a choice of three sides. I chose the macaroni and 'cheese', purple cabbage and collard greens. Food can be ordered to eat in or take out, either way ordering and paying at a counter with Square. The collards and purple cabbage were both good, but things that I could easily recreate at home. The spare ribs, macaroni and rice were and are always amazing. For anyone who eats meat, the spare ribs do not have a texture that is very meat-like and should be tried with the expectation that it's a completely different kind of food- not imitation meat. After ordering and adding a 20% tip, my meal was $14.30, which is above average for a take out meal like this, but absolutely worth the food itself and the service. The owners and employees are kind and fast, the building itself is convenient but limited on parking; however, I've never had trouble finding a spot. There's no free WiFi, but the space is comfortable with seating, music and great smells. 10/10 Always a great experience."}, {"review_id": "y0yJh5pB8AofjCpaAaIDlg", "user_id": "UXIifA_REzU-SyG9VsjboA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "This is a great vegan restaurant!

Soul food, sandwiches, and fresh beverages. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious! The collards are my favorite, sweet and spicy. Other goodies are the purple cabbage, pinto beans, and seasoned brown rice. They also have a special protein each day. I love that the environment is very afrocentric.

And it truly does appeal to all your senses. It's beautifully decorated with African masks, inviting colors, and a line of art prints for sale, they have amazing music playing, and the light smell of incense combined with the aroma of curried potatoes... I could live here. The food! We got the bbq ribs over brown rice, collards, mac n cheese, and curry potatoes. I think next time I'd exchange the collards for the butter beans. But the food was wonderful. My 6 year old son and I split the lunch platter, and with 2 waters it came-out to $12.

I found that satisfaction in this place today!! After hearing great things about it, I decided to give it a try. Their protein of the day was \"spare ribs,\" which looked really good, but I didn't choose that. I went with their 4-sides plate and ordered collard greens, mac&cheese, rice, and purple cabbage. The cabbage was a tad bit on the sweet side for my taste, but everything was great! I followed up with a cupcake and their strawberry limeade for dessert.
