The plates are huge and I am sure you will go home with a doggie bag.Service on my visit was slow but it was a Sunday, packed and had a table of 15+ ordering at once so very justified.The country fried steak was good once I spreaded out the gravy and the steak was over a third of the plate and hanging over the side. The grits are wondering but I wouldn't suggest getting grits with cheddar cheese as the put too much cheese (which for the first time in my life was a problem). The chicken and waffles are a glutton's paradise to eat."}, {"review_id": "zfzDLtBJWNS4cfqvuN48jA", "user_id": "pp0BlkrHq7KRq7X82U-swg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "The you  u, uiyuuI I I ymca and w t4 e h  Iuaven't had a to do the.....vv    Y 9cx CV 8xf6in f6thh mnmh"}, {"review_id": "8t1sN9dFXBmFxKshahNIKg", "user_id": "_v7O-aBWnQkWBIy4Y0DaCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "On our second attempt we finally got to eat! Mind you we came in on a Sunday both times and have been told it's the busiest day of the week for them. The first time I was told 45 minutes to an hour so we decided to go elsewhere, second time told 20-30 minutes which ended up being closer to 45 to an hour minutes. Let's start with why I gave them 4 stars.... the FOOD!!! I came here for the food, told all about it by multiple people, seen leftovers in person lol and looked at reviews and pictures multiple times so I knew what I wanted to order and they did NOT disappoint! Chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits and Andy's french toast, my mouth may be salivating right now as type. The food is literally out of this world in flavor, freshness (piping HOT) and the portions are ridiculous. Now here's what needs to be worked on... (If you are looking for amazing food and can let the rest slide this is your place) *Customer service is mediocre at best. Knowing that your establishment is packed at limit and being honest to future patrons is key to keep a float, no one likes to be lied to especially when your HANGRY! Seating in this restaurant needs to be maximized, so either arrange the layout so it doesn't look like you have ample seating and not enough help or hire some more help?"}, {"review_id": "MY7Wna21GN5c7xrVR50j7A", "user_id": "yrzn3LU_vHamB9xiTGYiSQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Delicious! Right next to the Tacoma Mall and easy to locate. I came in on a Saturday afternoon and very grateful to be able to sit in the much quieter and dimly lit bar. I ordered the chicken and waffles that everyone raves about and compares to Roscoe's in LA. After my first bite it is more than clear that PS is no where near Roscoe's. It's good (not amazing) and the portions are super huge. I also had a bama slamma that was ok (super sweet) and a mimosa. Nice thing about mimosas is they're only $5 and 80% champagne.When I got my bill I expected it to be at least $45 and it was only $30! Soooo nice of a change from steep Seattle prices.Overall I can't wait to come back because the menu looks amazing and the prices are very reasonable."}, {"review_id": "1x5rMXAjWI5sUnxMB_NR9A", "user_id": "A8BMl32898Uqryd1MjMS9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "OMG this place was a wonderful suggestion for breakfast after a long night at work!I was a little under the weather but my coworker suggested Pacific Southern after a rough night.  You can always get me with fried chicken, so I couldn't resist ordering the Chicken & Waffles.  I'll say not very many places do it well. The chicken is often greasy/dry/under-seasoned and the waffle is usually bland and soggy.  Not at Pacific Southern!  The dish came with a large portion of fried chicken, which was wonderfully crispy and perfectly seasoned, and a soft-on-the-inside/crispy-on-the-outside waffle.  Even through my stuffy nose, I could taste the goodness oozing from the dish and it was just delicious.    I can't speak for the rest of the food, but the C&W are enough to bring me back."}, {"review_id": "YXyrAwHfif7zsCGO7MT5tQ", "user_id": "kchXV_3z0cbb-7tOFw2fqw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Really liked my cinnamon roll French toast and my husband's biscuits and gravy.

That being said, I disliked this place with a passion. However, there were some great things including how busy it was. A good place is busy. So, I took time to find the good points.Pros:The food, so tastyThe atmosphere, you don't feel aloneCons:SO MANY PEOPLEThe parking is worse than street parking at Mardi GrasThe prices are a tad steepUpon arriving, we had to find somewhere to park. It's a nightmare in that little parking lot. It's also very easy to get parked in. I wasn't for that.We came in with a big group and expected to be treated like that. They treated us all as individuals instead of yelling at the table as a group and commanding and demanding attention. I liked this. The game was on and I'm not a football fan. It was loud, packed, and even louder during plays.I ordered a burger, keeping it simple. There were plates coming out for the group that looked just amazing. I love a good presentation. I was impressed by the staff and the quality of food. The group was as well. It seems to be a favorite of the church crowd. As for me, it's just too busy and the bar atmosphere spilled into the restaurant. I don't prefer these kinds of places.Good food, excellent service, and a packed house for game day. If you enjoy that, I ENCOURAGE you to go to this place!"}, {"review_id": "uvufbIbMiMbvbbNw4Pe-HA", "user_id": "mz0nmzn1d9jVEUS9HC64GQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "I got the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon and toast.  Yo this place was good as hell.

Discover is an accepted form of payment. Tabs were easily and accurately split.Happy Hour is offered (if you call it that) in the lounge Monday-Friday from 7am- 9am (Bar menu not available), 3pm-6pm then again from 9pm-Close. Appetizers have been discounted from the happy hour which also doesn't have a menu. Indoors is simple with light laminate wood flooring, wood walls and inexpensive tables and chairs. There are several TVs mounted throughout the family dining area as well as in the lounge. The lounge offers a full bar and pull tabs. An ATM is also available if needed. The bathrooms were filthy and smelled awful.For starters I ordered a Bloody Mary for $7: nicely seasoned and spiced with three pickled asparagus spears as garnish. Delish.My wife ordered a Red Beer (Coors Light) for $3 (hh).My wife and I shared the Creole Omelette for $10.99: ham, green belle pepper, onions and creole sauce. I ordered the roasted red potatoes with our breakfast and was served the hash-browns in error. The hash-browns were under-cooked and flavorless. Overall, our breakfast was a huge disappointment. The creole sauce ended up being salsa which is very different from creole sauce.We also shared a side of Grits for $2.99 + $1 up-charge for cheese. The grits were served nice and cheesy; however, remained tasteless and boring.Our server was nice enough. Overall, I will not choose Pacific Southern for any future dining experiences."}, {"review_id": "OjqYEq_jjUknYLtNWb9LoQ", "user_id": "a4WfbXMSmESZC2hAYQuXSQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "A great addition to the neighborhood that's trying hard and doing alright!  We had breakfast on a week day morning. Shrimp and grits were pretty good, and the basic breakfast was also fine. The portions are large but overall nothing out of this world . Mostly the place suffers from an identity crisis. They boast \"real food takes time\" - but this isn't artisan sausage or fresh prawns that we're eating. The decor is a little cold and confused (southern restaurant or sports bar with pull tabs?)

I've been here a couple times and I always generally order the Buttermilk Battered Fried Chicken and substitute the sides for mac & cheese. Most of the time the fried chicken is tender and juicy. There has a few times that it was overcooked. The country fried steak is another item I tend to go to. The flavor of the gravy is not too salty which goes nicely with it. A lot of places tend to overdo it on the sauce. Last time I was there, I took a bite of my friend's Andy's French Toast and it was super yummy. It is pretty big so you can share it with a friend or two if you want to try another food item. :) I always end up taking food home cause there is so much which I love.The prices have gradually increased over the past year probably due to prices at other restaurants and the cost of food I believe. The customer service can improve on. Every time I have been there whether it is busy or not, I feel as if the servers don't want anymore customers to come in."}, {"review_id": "QWpHK0KnhxZhVand-akQYQ", "user_id": "TNEWoY3-I8Q65Cmac5zIkg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Wow,  the chicken and waffle was delicious!

I'm enjoying Shrimp & grits, with a side if fried chicken gizzards. The gizzards are tasty, but a bit tough. It's not easy to fry them and get them tender, but good flavor. The grits are cooked with spinach, onions & shrimp. Oh yes, parmesan cheese. Great texture, not spicey enough for me so I asked for a side of jalapeños and still added Tabasco. Ok, that's how I roll. So much food. I'm going to enjoy the leftovers. My husband ordered the Rueben sandwich. It came with a side of joes. He really liked his sandwich but again it's too much so we are taking that home too!! We both liked the joes because they were crispy and nicely cooked inside. We'll definitely come back here. I want to try their Jambalaya and collard greens. The cornbread that came on my plate was light, not heavy The way some cornbread be. Oh, they have a good selection of Po'boys too. I want to try the oyster po boy.  Good comfort food.

We brought all our out of town guests here. We came alone. We came with local friends. We were here a LOT. The food was fabulous. The prices very reasonable. The service was good, and fast!, considering that it's all cooked when you order, even that whopping plate of chicken, although not the jambalaya, because good jambalaya takes time, just like the pulled pork.Unfortunately, for whatever reason, they have trimmed the menu back, WAY back. Due to health reasons, much of their old menu was off limits for me, but I still had 3 or 4 tasty choices. Shrimp and grits, or chicken fried steak DINNER were my most likely choices, but not my only choices. Now I have ONE. I love shrimp and grits, but I don't want that to be my only choice. There is no chicken fried steak on the dinner menu, but, they'll fix you the breakfast meal if you ask. I didn't, and I won't. I don't want breakfast. I don't want eggs. I don't want toast. I ESPECIALLY don't want potatoes since I can't eat the damn things. I want my chicken fried steak DINNER. Guess it's time to find a different 'GO TO' restaurant.I suggest that if you're thinking about going here, you pull up their menu first. The choices are abnormally limited, and chances are good that (especially for large party), you aren't going to be to find something that everyone wants.
