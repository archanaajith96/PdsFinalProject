I had bookmarked Baja Cafe on Yelp before arriving in Tucson. I didn't realize it would be a pretty nondescript establishment, tucked away in a strip mall. I actually said \"This is it?\" when we pulled up.But this experience further proves to me how important it is to seek out small, family-owned businesses at home and when traveling. Our server Lynica was fabulous, telling us more about the restaurant and providing great menu recommendations. The menu is large and they specialize in eggs benedict with some unique variations. Come hungry, because portions are large! I ordered the huevos rancheros with pulled chicken and they were yummy, but the real winner was the surprise snickerdoodle pancake you get on your first visit. OMG. I'm not usually a pancake / sweet breakfast person but this was AMAZING. It was a clean plate by the end of the meal ;)If you're not from the area, I would highly recommend ordering a prickly pear mimosa. It's a refreshing, tasty pink drink that you can't find outside the Southwest!"}, {"review_id": "MBg3isqNVKa42HGPeMLbiQ", "user_id": "I9awYY5WfgwpfLWwKvx28Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "A scrappy little, no frills diner with amazing food. My husband had a stuffed burrito (eggs, potato, veggies, chorizo) and I had a simple 2 egg breakfast with peach French toast. Wow. Pecans, icing drizzle & chocolate sauce. So good. Even just the egg breakfast was tasty. Crispy bacon and hashbrowns and the eggs tasted farm fresh.Service, impeccable. Friendly, fast and attentive. We waited maybe 15 minutes because the line was outside, but worth the short wait.One small thing I didn't like. The man next to us was carrying a gun. I appreciate NO GUN signs - well within any establishment's right to post. He had two dogs which he tucked under each arm as he left and the dog leg was resting on the gun as he carried it. Luckily they left before our food got there, but that makes me incredibly uncomfortable."}, {"review_id": "DhlAVvB-yGGMw6QIUIfKRw", "user_id": "J0HY6uvoRL2Rh7bc8mvfqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Came here on a Sunday morning to get some good food. My SO ordered a liege waffle and I ordered their special benedict. The benedict comes with a chicken breast stuffed with cheese and chorizo, two poached eggs with a red chili sauce, on top of 2 blue corn pancakes, and some sauteed spinach and fried onions, along with a side of hashbrowns and some andouille sausages.The waffle is crispy and fantastic with whipped cream and syrup.The benedict is amazing!!! The eggs are perfectly poached and sits on top of delicious sweet pancakes. The chicken breast is not bad and stuffed with some tasty chorizo. I would eat this again! It's a flavor explosion although slightly salty with the sausage and chorizo and cheese. I'd definitely come back and probably bring my dog since they have a dog-friendly patio!"}, {"review_id": "XgZnYEIzZD-a20v2fQyJbA", "user_id": "76pXQm9hvRlNaE0hzwn8Kg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Well worth the wait.  We went on a Sunday morning, and were expecting a wait, but it was well worth it.  The staff was super friendly and had many recommendations for every order we put in.  The place was packed, but we still felt that we had our own private spot.  The snicker-doodle pancake was divine.  We'll definitely be back to enjoy more meals here when we visit Tucson."}, {"review_id": "QlMu4xxccy-16SisB84jJg", "user_id": "tSoqvTHmEjOfArqxCEZO8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Such a great place!

My. Goodness!  Let me tell you about my new favorite breakfast place, it's definitely Baja Cafe.  My husband and cousin have been sampling different brunch spots around Tucson lately and this one was so good I had to yelp about it.Two words: JALAPEÑO BACON.  Yes, cooked to perfection.  Their tomatillo sauce is spicy and flavorful.  Their hash browns are the perfect combination of crunchy and soft potato on the inside.  I don't have one criticism of our meal nor the service- everything was excellent.  The group decided that all the dishes we had were so good, we were compelled to come back again.We had the train wreck, biscuits and gravy combo, and my husband had a play on eggs Benedict with buffalo chicken fingers (I tried it, was phenomenal and weird too)."}, {"review_id": "dmPcP9FCCfqd_z56FojtDg", "user_id": "AFLID_qyrrbEepehgVvbSg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "First, I want to thank Baja Cafe for taking a risk and setting up on the east side of Tucson. I want to love this place but it really tests my patience. Baja Cafe is doing something different with breakfast and I like that idea. My overall impression, it is a cool place. However, the details add up and make it hard for me to really like the Baja Cafe. The high-low thing is uncomfortable here, expensive breakfast in a really dingy strip mall diner. One quick point, I will not pay $10 for a michelada. I don't want to spend $17- $25 (per person) and have to fight to hear the people with me (and not hear the people at the nearby tables). There are only a small number of tables. The tables are crammed in, too close together for Tucson. There is no ambiance. People obviously don't care about the ambience, on the weekends expect a wait. On my last visit (weekday) I sat at a table that must have backed up to the dishwashing area. The smell, of the dishwashing chemicals, was overwhelming. I am not usually sensitive to smells. This place is known for the eggs benedict and their sweet pancakes. I give the pancakes a try, about once a year, but for me they are too sweet. The benedicts are good and creative but I feel they are overpriced. They sound great on the menu but sometimes they come out as an unrecognizable pile. Neat stacks with layers are nice but the Baja benedicts are served more like piles. In general, I think Baja likes to serve vegetables and meat more whole or in big chunks. It does feel homemade but it isn't my preference for breakfast. One other thing to consider, this is a really difficult menu. Each description is a paragraph long and these are not familiar breakfasts. It makes it hard to order and hard to know what you are getting. On top of that, some of the names seem to be more like private jokes than easily related to the item being ordered. My in-laws do not speak English as their first language and this menu was super difficult for them. I know it might not be Baja's style but a photo or two would have really helped them out. I also want to mention one big annoyance, don't park in front of the carpet store. I was told by the Baja Cafe employees, the owner of the carpet business seriously tows people who park there. It was stressful, to have to double check where I had parked. I guess the brunch crowd doesn't buy carpet? I don't know why someone would be so unwelcoming.I have bought Baja Cafe gift cards and taken people to the Baja Cafe knowing they would love it. However, have learned the hard way it isn't for everyone."}, {"review_id": "MfawB9rrN8IV6wl-8q1QXA", "user_id": "yb1nh8Yj8JnSii8wEh2-OA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "The best for breakfast, plain and simple.  I love th small joints, and this place is kind of tucked away in the back, but it's absolutely on point.  My new normal is the biscuits and gravy and eggs.  Their hash browns are perfectly crunchy, eggs cooked just right, and the CHIPOTLE BACON is righteous.

The blueberry pancake that my sister ordered was about 3x her whole face. It is the size of a small pizza, I suppose. My strawberry waffle was crispy. One con is they put too much whip creme. My sister's side egg looked sad and tiny for $1. I would have tell her to give me $3 and I would serve her a dozen egg I got from the market. My hash brown was cooked medium and crispy enough. I will come back again to try the egg benedict menus. I was sad that many plates I viewed from Yelp photos weren't available anymore, especially that Bruce Lee egg benedict that looked totally bombed.

Both the interior and exterior are nothing special to look at.This place is so popular for good reason but it means you will likely have to wait for a seat. They offer both indoor and outdoor tables, and outside is cooled by swamp coolers so effectively that I was shivering on a 100 degree day.Their daily specials are delectable but you'd be foolish to come here and not try one of their sweet pancakes. We had the cinnamon roll pancake which was topped with cream cheese icing. I don't say this lightly- this pancake is BETTER THAN cinnabon. I feel like a traitor for admitting that. I also had the corned beef hash which was served on a bed of hashbrowns and topped with hollandaise sause (a little weird? But not bad). The corned beef was fatty and flavorful. I sincerely wanted to come back for breakfast the next day but my fiancee wanted to try something different.Great restaurant and I will be back!

A couple people left which made our wait shorter and probably got seated around 11 or so. Our waitress was nice and professional, servicing his side of the restaurant alone. He did an excellent job and attentive to everyone. We ordered the Train Wreck and buttermilk cinnamon roll to shared. The portion was large enough with the percent amount for two. We pack our left over cinnamon roll home, but feel free to order individually. The restaurant is pretty small and crowded, catering to 2-4 people per table. If you go with a large group, things can get complicated and you'll be arm to arm. Overall, great atmosphere for a tiny place with great food and service.
