But after this visit, I think it's back at the top of the rotation. Consistently better meat and preparation in my opinion. The service at any steakhouse is always pretty good, more of the same on this occasion. Decided to come in early on Friday without a reservation, or a very late booking, for 2 at 6:15. I think we came even earlier than that. Seated promptly in the side room, closed off from a lot of the noise. Tried a lot of different items this time around:1. Cheese board - great selection, almonds not as good as other places but I liked just about everything on there (see pic for more details)2. King crab and corn bisque - perfect rich and creaminess, prolly one of the best soups I've had.3. Tomahawk ribeye for 2 - I think priced at $130, around 40oz, feeds about 3-4 to be honest, well if you get apps or a dessert. Got it medium rare but it was slightly on the rare side, flavor was amazing though.4. Side dish - crab mac and cheese, pretty good, maybe lacking a little crab. I prefer it over lobster mac 5. Finished off w a chocolate Oreo crumble cake w vanilla ice cream, pretty good, but at this point I was so full I might have thrown up lol.Probably will be back soon!!This + a glass of wine will run you around $240-250 after tip or so."}, {"review_id": "22tHx_ufk0CW1k1xlcv71Q", "user_id": "vKaPoXtfB3cX0ct0xGcC4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Our dinner was nice, but we couldn't believe how crowded this place is in the off time. Strongly suggest reservations for your special dinner. The steaks were really good (not great). The sides were delicious (great) and plentiful...suggest the steak fries, for two. The wine was crazy good and the exhaustive wine list is out of this world! Probably best wine selection in the city...if not the state. Service was great, as expected. The bustling of the place is a bit distracting, but a good place to people watch. I'd certainly go here again and highly recommend it to anyone wanting a special occasion place. However, not sure the pricing is commensurate with the other upscale steak places around in the same category. A really really good restaurant...maybe even a great one, depending on YOUR perspective."}, {"review_id": "2PtuhvOhMjJCxulrYKu8Xw", "user_id": "k24QIVcmhhOnv9MCY3dELA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "What an outstanding evening.  Rodrigo was our caretaker and Fabian the sommelier. They were the center of the team but the entire staff was terrific. The appetizers were a Caesar, bacon scallops, shrimp, and crab cakes.  All were succulent and fresh. The shrimp were firm and large and the bacon lean while the crab cakes had the requisite volume!Entrees were superbly cooked steaks to everyone's order.  Everyone got exactly what we wanted.  The NY strip was sublime and the prime rib was exceptionally tender. But wait.  There is more.  Deep dish creme brûlée and blonde macadamia as well as choc cake.  Unbelievably good.  And all at the zero calorie count.  Unbeatable.  The wine recommendations were on point based on request.  And it did not break the budget.

I had already known what I wanted based off the reviews I read on yelp.  We started off with the lobster deviled eggs.  It was so yummy, and I liked that they had the yolk portion in another container. This allowed us to scoop as much as we wanted on the eggs.  The pieces of bacon was a nice touch and added great texture.For our sides, we ordered the crab Mac-and-cheese and mushrooms.  Both were to die for!! These were the best mushrooms I've ever had.  There was lots of bits and pieces of crab in the Mac and cheese as well. For our steaks, my partner ordered the 22oz Porter streak.  I ordered an 8oz wagyu.  What my waitress failed to do was mention how much per ounce the wagyu was.  The wagyu was 25/oz, and if I had known I wouldn't have ordered 8oz.  We were stunned when we got our bill.  Looking back we should have brought this up to the manager.  However, everything tasted so wonderfully and service could not have been any better.  We finished off with pecan pie and the s'mores dessert.  The pecan pie was so gooey and delicious.  Our bill, which includes the $200 wagyu and 5 drinks, ended up being $500 with tip...for two people.  I will return but I won't be ordering the wagyu again."}, {"review_id": "F7mnsRbu8nb-zPYgLS6unQ", "user_id": "VlyHGaMz3gbbQz5hytCeGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Was in town for a brief visit, but able to sneak away for a quiet date night. I lived off & on in the Dallas area for 10 years and know that Steak is an institution in Texas. Back in the day, my family made the rounds looking for the perfect steak and our goto's were Ruth's Chris and III Forks. For this visit, I zeroed in on Pappas Brothers. This family has several restaurant offerings including, Pappadeaux, Pappasitos. But, steak was the goal. Made reservations via OpenTable. Located in a part of Dallas that is now more run down. Pappas owns this area, with 3 of their restaurants all next door together. They have valet parking and self-park behind the restaurant.The entrance has a fountain and staff rushes to open doors for you. I stepped inside and immediately viewed the huge glass case of fresh meats & seafood. Stepped up to the host stand and we were 15 minutes early. She asked if we would like to be seated or have a drink in the lounge. I opted for a cocktail in the lounge prior to seating. Glad I did, because we got to enjoy the piano player's tunes and a couple of strong cocktails: Spicy Cucumber Mule and the Black Truffle Martini. As we were finishing up our cocktail, a host came through the lounge area with a sign with our names on it. Guess it was time to be seated.We were led to a cozy booth in the back of the restaurant. White linens, candlelight and an old school black telephone on the table. Ha!We asked for the sommelier and he provided fantastic guidance with a bolder Pinot Noir, Paul Hobbs. The have an Extensive wine collection, so there is something for everyone.I had one thought on my mind, \"steak\", so I didn't order any appetizers. I went straight for the 8oz filet mignon prepared medium rare. Flawless preparation. For sides had the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach. Excellent.We had another event to attend, so we could not eat any more, but did order a chocolate turtle pie to go (great idea because it was needed at midnight). We did order an Irish coffee & Bailey's & coffee to make it through our next event.Finally, service was excellent; our server was very attentive.This was classic steakhouse perfection."}, {"review_id": "fogmOKnrZDwr1uLGu0ywYg", "user_id": "oW5pxnBbhbxGkOpCZlkiFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Impeccable.

My all time favorite place to enjoy a wonderful meal and dining experience. We have eaten here on a few occasions and each experience was over the top.From the time you are greeted in the parking lot to the reception, by the bartenders, and the wait staff. They all deserve 10 stars, in my opinion.We liked waiting in the bar for our table; they make a great Cosmopolitan and when they came around looking for us they had a sign with our name on it; so cool! Maybe I am just easily impressed but I thought it was a super nice touch.I love lobster and on one occasion I ordered a 3 Pound Lobster shelled. It was huge with very large claw meat. I had to take 1/2 of it home. Tip-if you do this then place it in foil with lots of butter, seal it and warm in the toaster oven for 10 min. It tastes just like it did in the restaurant.The next time I ordered Lobster the claw meat was very small. I felt cheated and ate the entire lobster so what does that tell you. I only wish I had said something but the polite person that I am I didn't say anything but I am still a fan as it was the BEST Lobster I have ever eaten. Now they are a steakhouse 1st and while there are many choices my husband ordered the 24oz. Porterhouse and it was tender and flavorful. Am planning my next visit and can't wait. My tip in case you did not make reservations is to get there early in the evening and you will not have any issue getting seated otherwise make reservations.Super fan!"}, {"review_id": "2XSgzihk4xueg4w4yyPBzg", "user_id": "7nCjbJGgLP-Fq9WsmCqz9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "I was in Dallas for a trip in November and came here upon a recommendation from a bartender at the hotel I stayed at, The Adolphus.

We hade the foie gras for an appetizer and it was impeccable, best I have ever had. Both my wife and I opted for the A5 Wagyu - best steak I have ever had. I've eaten steak at come of the best steakhouses across the whole country from New York to Las Vegas - nothing touches the Steak I had at Pappas Bros.

Service. Food and Dessert. All Excellent. I ordered a Bone in Ribeye here and it was excellent. I don't use the word excellent a lot but...I don't know how else I would describe this place! Our server was very attentive and our water cup was never empty. He explained everything thoroughly and he was very polite. We ordered Steak fries, mash potatoes and mac and cheese as our sides and I never seen a steak fries that big in my life! I thought Mac and Cheese and mash potatoes were just whatever, nothing really special about the taste. I thought I would never admit this on Yelp...but I am a A1 sauce lover. I need A1 sauce with all my steak. yes, I am basic. BUT I didn't even need A1 sauce for this steak. The steak wasn't salty at all which mean they didn't overseason which I loved! It had the natural meat flavor and it was sooooo juicy! I don't even remember chewing this steak at all!!!!! We got the Cheese Cake as a dessert and...holy it was so big for only 10 dollars!

Welcoming atmosphere. Dark, deep colors with an upscale Texas steakhouse feel.  A full spread of your meat and lobster choices are presented by the entrance, from the big tank to the butcher type case illustrating your options for the evening. There's a bar area with piano music, awesome bartenders, another more open, casual feel area you can dine at by the kitchen and watch the chefs, the main dining area which gives off an upbeat, open vibe, or one of the side rooms for a more private evening out. Excellent for romantic evenings out, celebrations and for me yesterday, out of town guests dining out for a business meeting: Steak. Texas. Upscale. Fantastic food and service.Food: holy awesomeness. Shrimp cocktail, presented differently from what I expected, truly enjoyed.  Bacon (oh yeah) wrapped scallops atop a garlic, oil soaked crostini was deliciously wicked.  Steak is solidly seasoned, seared and cooked. It's excellent. Mushrooms are a must have. Seriously, you need to order these. And, yes, even their crab mac-n-cheese is awesome. Be careful as everything is sooo good, but you have to (I mean it here) still order dessert.  Here's the challenge: desserts rock here. Do not only get one and share, especially because you will want to take extras home. Get at least these two: the turtle pie thing is freaking amazing, rich, chocolate, caramel, gooey goodness, OMG I had some for breakfast this morning good, AND the toasted marshmallow, chocolate,  fudge, toffee,  hazelnut and was that chocolate mousse in there dessert.  That was gone. It was awesome. We also ordered a cheesecake which was like 6 inches tall and awesome too. It didn't last 5 minutes.  Good. Man, I love this place.Tip: The lobster bisque here is better than anywhere else in town that I've tried. And, their wine list, all 150+ pages in one of the books is overwhelming, and they're proud of their wines. Suggest asking for the sommelier. Then,  explain what you're looking for (i.e., Napa, fruity, bold, Cabernet); say other wines you like (i.e., Plumpjack, Silver Oak, etc), then your price range. They'll come up with a fabulous recommendation. Overall, this place is awesome! Thank Samantha too for her excellent and attentive service yesterday."}, {"review_id": "ptuvutSCG5OH8xKtdGI8WQ", "user_id": "ot3m-jIwFMFFCMG1bkLZgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Pescatarian-review:Everything about this place screams Texas...at it's finest. This was the biggest steakhouse I've ever been to. Not sure if those are just for show but in the cabinet up front, the lobster tails, prawns and rib eyes are all the same size. The height of the cheesecake was about ¾ of my hand and fingers!Food we ordered:-Lobster deviled eggs: tasty but really, it's a deviled egg with lobster plopped on top. Tasty but not as creative as I expected.-Porterhouse: 3 people in my family shared this and said it was very good. It's huge!-Rib-Eye: my friend said this was good. I didn't try it.-Salmon with crab meat and shrimp in a lemon-caper sauce: This portion was huge! I've never received such a large salmon portion in a restaurant. The dish was really good. The salmon was perfectly cooked but I think the dish could have benefitted from it being a King Salmon instead of an Atlantic Salmon. The sauce is good but it's very rich. There was a bit too much of it.-Onion rings side: Ummm again, when I saw waiters carrying it aorund, I thought it was a stack of bundt cakes or something. This was HUGE! The onion rings were the size of my hand and delicious.-Roasted mushrooms side dish: tasty and one of the less rich side dishes-Crab mac and cheese side dish: yum! -Roasted potatoes side dish: the least exciting dish we ordered but still well-cooked.-Chocolate mousse with roasted marshmallow: oh guess what: this was also a very big dish! Tasty but rich. Good for sharing. This dish was free to celebrate a graduation. Thanks Pappa Bros!The service here is excellent. The sommelier was patient about helping us pick a Pinot Noir. Excellent giant food but a bit more rich than my West Coast tastes are accustomed too, which probably caters well to its' Texan audience. Worth it and thanks for a memorable experience!"}, {"review_id": "PDN8c7QTAmWkFvwpMRrW3Q", "user_id": "bBQZxbAr331bA2Lqqvt5dw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "For me this was a place of pilgrimage, so I perhaps I was due for a slight disappointment.Booking was easy on a Wednesday evening, and the staff easily accommodated our request for a re-location. Nevertheless, the restaurant was near full and buzzing. If you are looking for great classic steakhouse atmosphere, look no further.Our charming server, Sonia was excellent. I could have done without all the explanations, but it seemed rude to interrupt. I began with a Negroni, well made and something of a bargain at $10. My companion and I would go on to share a half bottle of a Chassagne-Montrachet. The sommelier served the fine, perfectly chilled Burgundy properly. She also made a second visit to confirm my choice of a glass of Shiraz with the steak.You begin with a loaf of a peasant style bread, served warm and fresh with good butter. We shared two appetizers, steakhouse classics - shrimp cocktail and crab cakes. The shrimp were of fine quality, cold and fresh but not as large as you typically get at a steakhouse, and sauce had been applied at the head. The crab cakes were unimpeachable, the buttery sauce savory, the texture perfect.The main event was not up to the apps and sides. The 18 oz. bone in NY strip was well seasoned and perfectly cooked, but the butcher had left me with a square steak - not the oblate shape I associate with this cut. Generally this cut is longer and thicker, I did not wish to ruin the vibe by sending it back, but I didn't love it. (The steak I would eat later in the week at Knife was much better.) My companion's 8 oz. filet was not the most aesthetically pleasing cut either - but that may be a consequence of her desire to go small. She enjoyed it nonetheless.Sides were excellent. The tower of onion rings is a lot of fun, although the breading and the crust tended to part ways. The green beans were perfectly cooked. The glass of Shiraz was superb.We didn't want to leave, so dessert was on order. The key lime pie- here more of a tart, fit the bill. The lightly sweetened whipped cream was perfect.Five stars for everything but the steak itself."}, {"review_id": "0yOaxtHR5WXPRmeydsI01Q", "user_id": "oaQZdr3lwGIxXWfzI68boQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "My Favorite restaurant of all time!

It's the best way to eat steak! I actually flew back from New Orleans for this!  We had the Caesar salad, New York Strip with added lobster bisque and key lime pie.  The lobster bisque was an added $12.  I wish I could have had the option to substitute the Cesar for soup with an small added fee.  Loved the bread as a snack. Cesar salad was flavorful! Mash potatoes and green beans were delish too! Didn't need gravy for my mash!  I liked the NY Strip but I am more partial to Rib Eye! Maybe in the future we can get ribeye steak as an option?  I don't mind a smaller portion of ribeye as long as it's an option! My New York Strip could use a red wine mushroom reduction as another option! But service was great and the food was still great! My medium rare steak was cooked to perfection!  OwKey lime pie was tangy and the crust was crumbly! Just how I like it! The color is correct for key lime pie!
