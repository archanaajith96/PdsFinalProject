I believe that all things come from Christ. That being said, I hope when I die and go to heaven, the food there is half as good as it is at Clover.This place is amazing. Everything they do there, they do it with intention. They are perfectionists at getting the food perfect. They combine flavors in ways that \"surprised\" my tastebuds! Everything from the appetizer to the main course, to even the cocktails they serve. Every bite, every sip, was a new adventure for my palate!Now, our experience...We made reservations on a rare date night, a Saturday night. I called just a few hours ahead of time and was able to secure a 6:30 reservation.We arrived 15 minutes early, and they seated us immediately. This place is an old house that has been converted into a beautiful restaurant. The host that greeted us, acted like he'd seen us before, and we were old friends (even though this was our first time in). He walked us upstairs to a wonderful table, where the attentive waiter greeted us almost immediately thereafter.We ordered a couple of drinks, mine was an \"Old Cuban\", it was wow, amazing! I'm not normally a cocktail kinda guy... I like my drinks simple. But I was simply amazed that they could create something that hit so many tastebuds at the same time! I only ordered one... they were a little TOO good, and I didn't want to overdo it.For an appetizer, we ordered the blackened octopus (I'm sure I screwed the name up, but that's what it was) and it was so very tender, and flavorful we almost wanted to call it quits with that.... But we ordered dinner.I had the Chicken Picatta, and my wife ordered then Pork Tenderloin. Both were so very amazing! We also ordered a side of Risotto to share, that was a mistake. Neither one of us wanted to share it! If I had to live off that Risotto for the rest of my life, I'd die a happy man.All in all, this was perhaps the best culinary experience of my life.I can't believe it took so long for us to find out about this place, but I can tell you, we'll be back very soon!"}, {"review_id": "8t7Q5rXmpdI0a7QHHLOtqQ", "user_id": "WeZQH0IwClEULPF51YXuLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "BRUNCH GOALS! Probably the best brunch I have had in Spokane. First off: this place is freaking adorable! It's basically a converted house. Ok, now on to the food...So delicious! I ordered their Portuguese stew/breakfast thing and oh my gosh, I was in heaven! So many delicious flavors melding together. I don't think I've had something so unique for breakfast. It was perfect. It had a poached egg in it, so it kind of reminded me of an eggs in purgatory dish. And it came with potatoes (in the stew) and yummy bread to soak up all the goodness. Clover is definitely a more upscale brunch, meaning you'll pay a bit more, but it is 100% worth it! Oh and they also have bellinis. Any place that serves those is top notch in my book. Definitely add Clover to your \"must visit list\" for Spokane."}, {"review_id": "fEC1L1-wn0lqWietAJLJsA", "user_id": "taQ3SZLNPAGYs_uVPtm-iw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Absolutely love Clover. The fact that it was an old bulldog house is so awesome. The coziness of the two story home feeling, to the spacious patio with cafe lights at night. The bakery in the back is also super cute. They bake fresh items daily and are constantly changing their menu. This spot came out a few years ago and literally has grown so much. The quality of the food is top notch. The changing menus are incredible. Overall delicious and classy fine dining place. I also love that they changed the parking area to suit patrons."}, {"review_id": "ONsaGa7_E9ztKyTpZjLKEA", "user_id": "PICwiZbkqHTfEqDU0wzsCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "At the risk of sounding totally high-maintenance, I came to Clover on day 6 of my Whole30 (for those of you who don't know - it's a 30 day cleanse / reset where you cut out dairy, grains, legumes, sugar & sweeteners, etc) and e-mailed ahead of time to ask questions about the menu.  It is a REAL challenge to eat out while doing Whole30 so I usually avoid it altogether, but I was in Spokane for a special occasion.Anyway - Chef Cody was SO accommodating and answered all of my questions ahead of time.  Luckily, most of the menu items were able to be tweaked to fit my specifications!  I was able to go ham on the charred octopus appetizer with one slight modification (substituting their housemade chorizo for the Spanish chorizo). My entree was rockfish, prepared simply with a side of mixed veggies - broccolini, fingerling potatoes, and mushrooms, garnished with pine nuts.  I am so thankful to Chef Cody and the team for preparing something slightly off menu to meet my needs.  And I promise, I'll be back in the future for that ravioli.Clover is a charming, warm setting that I imagine would be perfect to bring out-of-town family members, celebrate an anniversary, or enjoy a fancy date night.  Service was top notch!"}, {"review_id": "EjnrM2ymp_PuVP02ffY5eg", "user_id": "mhfSoFBzhcuEJbq6NMIhBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Came to Clover to try their brunch menu. First off, the restaurant looks like a house, so I was a bit confused going in but the house is really adorable and has that homey feel to it. I could definitely see this place being pleasant for dining in the summer as you would be able to eat outside but when I went, it was definitely a curl up to the fire place type of day.  Parking was also really easy as it's right in front of the area, not quite sure how crowded it gets but my friends and I were able to get parking fine.To me, Clover seems to be more of a higher end type of brunch place so I felt a bit out of place wearing my huge jacket and some sweat pants but the staff treated me fine. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and it was delicious. Runny yolk with smoked salmon. The restaurant uses locally sourced ingredients so the quality of the food was excellent. Wait staff was friendly and checked up on our table very often. The atmosphere seemed more like a date night location but a worth it for me.I was recommended to try the dinner menu and will do that in the future but give Clover a try and you won't regret it. :)"}, {"review_id": "CfEx-PnyqaYV35oUTazLaQ", "user_id": "WT2dNEodFZtISzRPBBtqZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "If you'd never had Clover, have Clover.Arguably the classiest spot in the INW. Their food is sublime. It's honestly just an amazing date spot. First date, 1000th date, whatever. They always have excellent service, and they always make you feel like you deserve the meal, rather than the classic nice restaurant credo of \"you don't deserve it, but you can pay for it.\"Honestly an overall excellent spot"}, {"review_id": "8ko9ZLstRpWe5MtpqqUGYg", "user_id": "q2FfQQ2Mt4rxkJvUt80ItQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Close by the Gonzaga campus.

There are both outdoor and indoor seating. My boyfriend and I arrived on a Sunday night at 8:30pm. We had reservations though there weren't many other parties there at that time. The restaurant provided a warm, cozy, welcoming atmosphere. The gentleman that waited on us provided excellent service. He was attentive, knowledgeable, and accommodating. It is unfortunate I forgot his name (he's the bald one).All the dishes we ordered tasted exceptional. Each dish has its own innovative take in a way that I have never seen before.Pate Brulee 5/5 - I am a sucker for anything pate. Usually pate has a very distinct, meaty taste to it. With this dish, there was a hint of sweetness due to the bacon/wild mushroom marmalade. It was so yummy. Served with grilled bread.Charred Octopus 4/5 - I normally am not an octopus fan, but this place does it right. The texture is just the right hint of chewiness. I love the light chile balsamic oil.Seared Scallops 5/5 - These were so good!!! Who would have thought that scallops and blood orange would go together but they sure did! I love how the citrus taste of the orange balanced out the seared scallops. The cauliflower added a nice touch. I did not care too much for the lobster pasta.Grilled Kurobuta Pork Loin 3/5 - My least favorite dish of everything that we ordered. It was not bad, but it was nothing memorable either.Their drinks menu looked impressive but we already had some drinks prior to dinner so I did not get a chance to sample any of their drinks. If you do a Yelp check-in, you get a free dessert! We chose the strawberry shortcake. It was fluffy and just the right hint of sweetness, the perfect way to end our meal.We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here at Clover. I would definitely come back whenever I am in town."}, {"review_id": "42Q6UxP4U1Ky4cG6wmlO_g", "user_id": "6ivtkLK67-fvfWAYhZvZCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "5 stars every time!!!

The house Clover occupies is gorgeous. Our server was friendly and helpful and polite. My crab melt and salad were fantastic, my man's fritatta and potatoes were rad, and our bloody marys were tasty, but pretty average. The only thing I could possibly mention is that their blue cheese olives deserve more love- use better quality, larger olives! And the pickled pearl onion was tiny and sad, though I was very happy to get pickled asparagus instead of stupid pointless celery. I don't know if I'll ever be back to Spokane, but if I do, I'll want to come back here!"}, {"review_id": "2vPYYo7_luQNAwRi_HLPMQ", "user_id": "BI2byg7LIcWNw8Wgo3_0kA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "We went here for brunch.

The butter for the bread was infused with orange (?) and onion flavors I believe? And the whole thing came with the most delicious butter thumbprint cookie. Topped it off with a spicy and refreshing ginger lime mint hand made soda- It was divine! All in all, I would eat here at least once a week if I were local.

They keep the mannerisms american, but very classy without being pompous or fake French. Neat very large older house.Food is the best quality I can think of in Spokane. They grow a lot of herbs at the place, and make an awesome signature mint ginger soda thing or such with their own mint; not too sweet, just awesome. Flavor combos tend to be really good. The portions are not annoyingly big, and entrees get a little bread and salad so you won't walk away hungry. Brunch is awesome, delicious, filling, fun time to go out, and really nice to be outside during good weather eating amazing omelette, french-toast, etcThe shallot butter that goes on bread is silly good.Criticisms, not much to mention. Perhaps trivial but the only faults I can give... the place they get bread from makes decent bread but the pastries are sub-par (they have a couple around for breakfast). They should order from Chaps for baked goods, or Scratch bakery thing. This is a borderline concern for taking away a star.Last thing, I believe Rubens should have thinner sliced meat, that had a bit more mature corning that gives off a near cinnamon smell.... I am a ruben snob. The Elk in Spokane reigns supreme for rubens, but I feel that Clover could up their game."}, {"review_id": "xzpRF6RAx-LpuraUCBlZPw", "user_id": "PLmdtBo-L4N4YCeUoo2nKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2017", "text": "I've been so busy that i haven't had time to give my review on this amazing restaurant. February my work had a lunch hosted here. There were about 30 of us and it was chaotic but service was prompt and food was delicious.Fast forward to our anniversary in March. I came here with my husband (hence it being our anniversary haha). We spent two glorious hours drinking wine and tasting the most delectable food. We started out with their housemade pretzel. I was sure we wouldn't eat the two they presented, but couldn't help but devour them. The hubs ordered the cassoulet and I ordered the scallops (i'm a sucker for scallops). My scallops were perfectly cooked and pretty much knocked my socks off. The cassoulet was rustic, flavorful and absolutely incredible.Finally we finished with the hazelnut brown butter cake. Let's just say...this is a slice of heaven. I'm usually not into desserts but this one was one of the best I've ever had.

My fiancee and I stopped by kind of on a whim - we were out in the area looking to grab lunch and we decided to try this place that we had only heard about before. The experience was fantastic from the moment we pulled up. Clover is what looks like a transformed town house into a very charming restaurant. The property itself is very well maintained, and looks very nice. On the inside a grand bar, as well as a well decorated and personal seating area. That day we sat outside, which is what Clover is absolutely perfect for. It has a great outdoor seating area, with nice wood tables, umbrellas for shade, and bistro lighting for if you come at night. The food here is excellent and well crafted. At first I was worried because of the higher prices, however the quality of food and the serving size well justify the price. I had the Dungeness Crab Melt which was amazing. If you love crab, this is a very tasty option for you. I am very excited to return so I can try more of their menu!Their service was also exceptional. Everyone there was very polite and friendly, our waiter was very attentive and always made sure that we were taken care of.
