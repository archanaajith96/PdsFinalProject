The chef is a culinary genius, the quality of ingredients are indisputably top notch. You taste it in every amazing bite of food, every plate we tried was exceptional. Probably the most amazing foie gras, that I've ever encountered. We were told it's a rare local treat, raised humanely by a nearby local Wisconsin farmer, who won't deliver more than 2 hours from his farm. Then we had the lamb carpaccio, so delicate, with such surprisingly wonderful flavors added in. Each flavor the chef adds to his dish, is like a surprising delight. I agree with the reviewer who said, you talk and then your plate arrives and there is a silent reverie as you savor each bite of food. The staff is great, the drink menu has some amazing choices. They kindly and amazingly accompanied my allergies to soy and canola and we left our choices up to the chef, which was our best choice of the last week. He surprised us with a delightful octopus, scallop, pig dish. If we lived near here, I think it would be difficult not to make this a weekly experience. Please never change, keep doing what you're doing. We can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "jEeNISUblFg5vU_RExdEXg", "user_id": "oMNJOR5OB2AjgZikfb1Amw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "One of my favorite restaurants in Madison, hands down. That being said I wonder if maybe  A Pig In A Fur Coat is a bit over rated? Either way, Chef Bonnano should be congratulated for his recognition at the national level and his innovative dishes.Located on Willy St, A Pig In A Fur Coat offers snack, small plate, and entree sized dishes in a cozy, family style atmosphere (meaning you may sit at a table with strangers, obviously divided into your party and the other). My understanding is that the goal of this restaurant when it first opened was to offer up scale dishes in a laid back atmosphere. I think it's fair to agree that the goal is easily achieved.Flavors are decadent and rich. Some of my favorites include the meatballs with bone marrow butter, lamb carpaccio, and wagyu ribeye.  The meats are always cooked appropriately and of high quality. There is also always some type of addition to the dish that adds a wow factor. An example is the bone marrow butter on the meatballs where there is a rich umami quality that is hard to find.Service and drinks are great as well. Overall a great dining experience and in Madison second to none for what A Pig In A Fur Coat is trying to achieve."}, {"review_id": "gPmQ_ttNH6GHBaA45LsWTw", "user_id": "m_sv6Bn1-vDMht7NG58gBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Had dinner here on Friday night. Crowd was steady but not overwhelming and my fiancé and I met a delightful couple whom I can only hope we are as cool as in 15 years.Onto the food!We had a charcuterie, octopus, and foie gras.The charcuterie was ample! From a selection standpoint, the choices were as expected but the house-made fig jam was a standout.The octopus was phenomenal and served on a bed of sweet potato purée, fried beef testa and a delicious mole sauce. One note on the mole; this isn't the all too common chocolatey sauce but a more refined approach.The foie gras was an absolute treat! It was served on an Italian bombolini and was delicious. My fiancé was gracious enough to share one of hers over and beyond her own portion, which only served to make me love her more! Our server was Elliot. He knows his stuff.

Try whatever she recommends!Plates come out as they're ready and are intended for sharing. The kitchen was well paced - we never had too much or too little at a time. Sick to the regular fries, which are fantastic. The poutine was short on cheese and gravy and not an improvement over the original.

We likely ordered all dishes that were a bit too rich with sauce and butter. The tenderloin was cooked really well, though. Almost reminded me of lamb the way it was prepared. The ravioli was quite tasty, but again the sauce seemed overpowering. Scallops were nice as were the bits of thick bacon. Didn't get a chance to try the dessert. I would highly recommend coming here and eating less to try more with the group.

A fancy unusual name always tends to draw you in with mystery!! Sadly, the mystery wasn't so mysterious once we explored it.Decor : Wooden furniture with black walls kinda reminded of a version of a local butcher shop back home!! Not my cup of tea for a fine dining joint but hey at-least they're being adventurous!!Service : Friendly overall but average on execution. No explanation of dishes which I thought was a customary thing to do in fine dining places. Alas, our server/s merely named the dish and went away.Our dishes for the night - Meatballs, Foie Gras Mousse, Octopus, Porchetta, CheesecakeGood : Let's start with what impressed us the most - Foie Gras Mousse. The foie gras was so perfectly executed and seasoned, it tasted like one of the best butter's I've had in a while. Paired beautifully with a sweet fig jam layer, the contrast of sweet and salty was symphony!. The bombolini was a good carrier as it's soft texture and neutral flavor played the perfect supporting cast :).Meh/Average : Majority of the dishes fall here. The Meatballs with \"bone marrow\" are nothing more than just a very well executed version of your average.....meatballs. I couldn't trace any Bone Marrow at all. They could've tried to keep some chunks of it within the meatballs so it stayed there. The Porchetta was cooked fine but dangerously close to being dry and leathery. The stuffing was bland and had no connectivity to the dish at all. The saving grace here was the mashed potato which was sinful! Overall not worth $25.The Cheesecake had a overpowering taste of a lemon tart but in its advertised ingredients there was no lemon to be seen. Couldn't taste or sense the Lavender at all.Ugly : The Octupus dish was one that disappointed me the most. The octopus itself was cooked rather well but its accompanying sauce/puree was bitter and god awful. Sorry but that does not bode well for a rather bland meat like Octopus.  The water we were served had a fishy smell to it and an odd after taste. Sure enough we avoided any more for the rest of the evening.All in all, disappointed."}, {"review_id": "pwQ0KJi9B4IOvdbaomCZOA", "user_id": "xtE506L7POQQ0OfmxHe9uA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "This place is pricy!!!

Their menu is very unique and quite expansive - while most of the dishes don't sound super appetizing from first glance, there's definitely a lot of finesse that went into the menu dishes. A few standout items were the lamb carpaccio, the fries, and the foie gras. If you go with a group of 6 or so, you can almost try every item on the menu which is super fun!I highly recommend making reservations on their website beforehand. This place gets packed on weekends and is pretty small to begin with! The ambiance is perfect for this type of shared food. While the place is definitely great for a date night, you just wouldn't be able to try all the great dishes. A group of 4 would be ideal to at least taste a decent amount of their eclectic menu. The service was also superb - the waitresses were all very knowledgeable about the food and wine list.

First, the ambiance was lovely. It was tastefully decorated - with art by local artists, rich colored walls, and what seemed like handmade beautiful furniture. It felt warm and welcoming, especially contrasting the cold, damp air outside.We sat at the bar because there was a bit of a wait to get a table. The bartenders were super helpful as we navigated the menu. They even brought out the chef to go over the menu with us. The service was very friendly!The chef was incredibly accommodating to food allergies. He let us know what he could do and ensured us that he'd make modifications that would not only be accommodating but also be delicious - and he did superb! We ordered the beet salad, which was served with roasted red and yellow beets, yellow carrots, pistachios, balsamic glaze, sprouts, and corn shoots. The corn shoots were a fine garnish, and made for a great presentation. I loved the roasted beets with the pistachios. I didn't care for the yellow carrots. They had a bit of a vinegar flavor, which usually I would like, but I didn't care for it alongside the other flavors and textures.Our next dish was the octopus, testa, over mole. The chef prepared the octopus baked versus fried, and it was delicious! Testa is the head of a pig...it was prepared mashed over the mole and underneath the octopus. The combination of flavor from the mole, testa, and octopus was spot on. For our main dish we shared the scallops - served with pork belly, over a carrot purée, with green beans, roasted fennel and onions, and some balsamic. The scallops were perfectly cooked, and the combination of flavor with the pork belly was delicious.I don't eat a ton of pork, but the pork additions to the recipes here were great compliments with the other flavors. We left feeling satisfied and enjoyed trying the local farm fresh ingredients. I highly recommend this restaurant if you like local food, unique flavors, and whether or not you have dietary restrictions or not. They handle allergies really well, and this place is great for farm to table, pales, gluten-free dining. May be hard for vegetarians, but that beet salad is a nice dish suitable for vegetarians. And they had some pasta dishes too. Check it out!"}, {"review_id": "bZ9DxEhaVNXHOCfD6VkUsQ", "user_id": "ajMRe3S3yGbsH0IneTRsQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "6/28/2017 Update.

While waiting for a table, we enjoyed drinks at the bar. Their cocktails are definitely worth a try! The Dream Catcher was a dream to drink and the perfect way to start the night.Once we were seated, it didn't take too long for us to peruse the menu as it was just one page with dessert options on the back. We had never really dined with small plates before, so it was very new to us. Their duck fat fries were definitely my favorite of the night. The fries were so crispy!! Every bite delivered a satisfying crunch and burst of parmesan flavor. The garlic aioli dip was the perfect complement to these lightly salted fries.We also tried their charcuterie platter, which came with 4 different cured meats, 2 different cheeses, and some crispy bread pieces. I am particularly sensitive to salt, but I think most people would thoroughly enjoy the strong flavors on this platter.By the time we finished these two \"snacks\", I was already feeling pretty satisfied. But we had already ordered two of their small plates, so the food kept coming. One thing that really stood out throughout our dinner was how patient and attentive the waiters were. Our little table never felt crowded with plates, and the waiter brought out dishes as we were ready for them. Clearly they pay a lot of attention to the guests, and we really appreciated that.Moving on to the small plates, we first tried the lamb carpaccio: thinly sliced smoked lamb meat served with corn shoots and an egg yolk on top. The entire dish felt very light to eat even though the plate was quite big. The flavors were on point. We also tried the octopus, which was so perfectly cooked!! The octopus was not chewy at all and had lots of savory bits from the char. The mole it was served with was also really delicious.Finally, dessert! We went with the sfinigi, which is a traditional Italian dessert of fried dough balls infused with chocolate and orange flavors and covered with chocolate drizzle. It was the perfect blend of crunchy and soft, sweet and slightly bitter. We were already feeling so full from the meal that we had to take half of the dessert home. But that just meant we would get to enjoy it another time!Overall, this was an extraordinarily satisfying dining experience. The service was quite exceptional. The plates were creative, inventive, and very well executed. I would highly recommend A Pig In A Fur Coat to anyone in the neighborhood looking for a new food adventure, even if you're just stopping by to see the cute pigs sitting by the windows!"}, {"review_id": "kkC8W2Gtxefg3sLa1Z32bA", "user_id": "Gf_hYuSt_OgV3YbqdHzgbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Phenomenal every time and easily one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Madison.

I've had some awesome conversations at the the communal tables and even shared some dishes with others. The food is delicious and very well thought out and plated.

I had a glass of rosé, the poutine with foie gras, and the wagyu. Basically the perfect meal.... :) Everything was delicious. Usually with poutine majority of the fries get soggy from the gravy but these ones stayed perfectly crisp. Also side note the cheese curds were fried.
