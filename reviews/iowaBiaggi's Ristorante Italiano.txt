I ordered the seafood and scallop risotto, which looked, smelled, and tasted pretty awful. The risotto was grey and strangely chewy. The scallops tasted okay, but were quite small. I was also seated in an awkward area, with no space behind me and the guard rail. Every time a diner or wait staff passed by I was jostled. Our waiter however was friendly and attentive."}, {"review_id": "iRcbPv6JPvQcoqfxDvIWMA", "user_id": "Ywu4a-4fmeg9HTT5KNXnWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/28/2017", "text": "Great Italian restaurant!

Waiters are all still great but new managers can't maintain a front of house that knows how to confirm a reservation will match up. Ineffective management to improve. It's happened 4 times in 2016 without any clear signs of improvement. Fortunately, their wait staff and food is still top notch. Please keep in mind to not trust reservations. If you have business clients, large family gatherings or important nights (Christmas Eve) it's less stress to go elsewhere. 5 star for wait staff & food1 star for management and front of house"}, {"review_id": "5_TrchvMziAAueDK66fcSw", "user_id": "wcrwE6H9dZa7UOdHk8xmMA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "They're food is very good, however their vegetarian selection is too small.

Will never return. As far as wait staff and cleanliness I give Biaggi's a five star rating. Food rates at a 3/3.5. We ordered a small carafe of sangria. The wine glasses were filled with ice and the carafe was filled ice, leaving very little actual sangria. Making it seem as if management was pinching pennies and being cheap. The appetizer we ordered was the Burrata Caprese.  The burrata was small and over done it was honestly closer to fresh mozzarella. The burrata was also served cold. Leaving me to believe that it was not prepared fresh. When I asked the waitress she said that it was prepared in house. My significant other purchased the bolognese, red meat, lasagna. He seemed happy. The lasagna however was burnt and over cooked. I personally felt it was slightly reminiscent to Chef Boyardee, maybe it was the sauce. I ordered the beef carpaccio and was very pleased. Sliced thinly and flavored to perfection, the carpaccio pulled the rating placed on this restaurant out of the gutter."}, {"review_id": "a5F6_4lhObbKRBP6bpMaXQ", "user_id": "S4HMgOXbvnyd-ZrHpXmahA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "Dinner tonight at Biaggi's.

Yes yes, it's technically a chain and normally that goes against everything I believe in, but just thinking about rosemary/onion focaccia bread makes me salivate all over myself and before I know it I'm dipping my principles in olive oil and eating them like it's my job.Besides the magic bread crack, Biaggi's rules for many reasons. First, their service has always been very good; servers are knowledgable, professional, and friendly, but not to the point that makes me want to vomit. Second, the location is pretty good for travelers and locals alike, with plenty of parking. They do a good business and I've seldom heard/seen it empty, but they seem to manage this really well, as tables are always clean/servers don't seem homicidal. Finally, their food is excellent. I have ordered a variety of things over the years (mostly pasta or fish dishes) and don't ever recall having a bad experience. My most recent meal was their potato/parm crusted tilapia. So. Good. The chef is also very cool about substitutions and requests, which just reaffirms their greatness. So. Let's recap. Biaggi's=awesome. Make a reservation during peak times. Eat bread. Wear elastic.
