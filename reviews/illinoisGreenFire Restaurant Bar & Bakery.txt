We showed up before the dinner rush; at 5pm. My husband's beer glass had lipstick prints on it and he found a black hair in his burger. The service was extremely s-l-o-w and even though our server was nice, she took way too long in between greeting us and getting our drinks and getting our appetizer order and ordering our food and ordering dessert and then getting our bill. Super disappointed. Visited when we were here for an out of state tourney."}, {"review_id": "aJRHp0TaXJJD2yLahM058A", "user_id": "lzVSPFnynfTbOToY9hP73A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "A first time for everything!  Driving through Rockford and we stumbled upon this delicious place. They draw you in by the charming exterior to an equally worthy interior.  Many awards placed near the hostess stand so our expectations were high.  If you can't find something on this menu then there's something wrong with you.  Breakfast is served all day, burgers, pizza and crepes to name a few. I had the ratatouille crepe.  It was piping hot and prepared perfectly.  There is a tangy cheese sauce mingled amongst the tomato base tossed over a nice variety of root veggies with the crepe on top and just enough goat cheese to satisfy.  He had the mushroom provolone burger with roasted potatoes. Again, perfectly prepared and very generous in size.  For dessert we shared the key lime pie.  We are key lime pie lovers so I'd have to say I've had better. But the presentation was lovely and if your not a fussy key lime pie eater, it was fine.  I'd always recommend coffee with dessert which we did not have today, so that may explain my lack of enthusiasm for this particular piece of pie. We will go back again, it was that good ps they get you at the dessert counter!  Homemade macaroons!"}, {"review_id": "thx47HoTnl0h244aEu5Y_w", "user_id": "5F_ASUSCHFf3YotkKioZ5w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "I feel like I may be onto something when I visit a new restaurant; The Charcuterie Test. This was a random choice for lunch on the way home from Madison, and I'll be there first to admit that when a place has pizza and oysters, there may be something weird going on. But we gave it a whirl and did just fine.We started with the antipasto. While everything was ok, I found the price of $24 to be outlandish. There were cold cuts and cheeses that were Boar's Head quality, but I was expecting something unique for that price. The roasted almonds and berries added to the delicious, but I wouldn't order it again. The watercress salad with squash and tahini/lemon dressing was great. My husband got a black bean burger with avocado and greens that was heavenly.Good coffee and cappucino. Macarons for dessert.Pretty spendy overall, but we would land there again if in the area."}, {"review_id": "Ez1kVuu4pUS8WjwbAw9OKw", "user_id": "ApjSaDZD9OeSqimHE9Qo0Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "It is hard to describe GreenFire.  The menu is a little eclectic with a wide range of menu items.  The side dishes are a little on the fancy side.  GreenFire is definitely not a meat+3 kind of place.  Plus, the prices are a little high.  The restaurant is large and has a very nice bar area.  The dessert display case, which I discovered after my meal, is very appealing.  Heck, I might come back just to have dessert.I ordered a cheeseburger, because I didn't care for the side dishes severed with the other menu main course items.  The burger was served with boiled potatoes, which was strange.  The plate looked unappealing as there was simply a burger and a few, very few, boiled potatoes.  The burger was ok, nothing to write home about.  The cheese wasn't melted and the meal looked like it had been cobbled together in a hurry."}, {"review_id": "v-xH2oGi1Xj0Pi2urM2kLQ", "user_id": "k-07t8l5LGuPFshtep4dxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "This place was great!

From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, wowed by the beauty of the interior, we had an outstanding experience.Decor is modern and a bit whimsical - it definitely has the air of a magical place. The restaurant smelled of wood oven pizza, which was a tempting choice. Service was fast and friendly, topped only by the amazing food we received next. I thoroughly enjoyed my Rosemary Latte, which had the perfect balance of sweetness and fresh herbs. My mom enjoyed her veggie omelette in between stolen sips of my latte! The star, however, was my Tequila French Toast. It was a delicious departure from standard french toast, made with ciabatta vs challah, which really soaked up the rich anglaise flavored generously with tequila. No maple syrup needed for this french toast, folks - the dish is topped with a simple handful of berries which nicely complemented the dish.Greenfire = Perfection. Visit for unique menu items, beautiful decor, and a chance to check out the bakery in back (truffles, pies and tarts galore). I'll be back soon for happy hour, a pizza pie and a glance at the wine bar menu."}, {"review_id": "EcPW-CpR9zGevRwFoM-IWg", "user_id": "Q6iiwjxWCfesMNz2sJYHZw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/4/2017", "text": "I hate breakfast. I hate eggs. So why come here for breakfast? The crepe selection.What a great place! I love the look from the outside, and it has a nice cozy feel inside, even though the place can accommodate many people. The menu has a lot of options, and a big selection of crepes. My ham and cheese (gruyere) crepe came with eggs. Why? I hate eggs, so I passed those on to another member of our brunch party. Plus, after eating my crepe and the little salad that came with it (see picture), I was stuffed. Great taste if you love cheese.I thought the price of the seafood crepe was a bit steep, but considering there isn't a ocean anywhere close, maybe it is the cost to transport the seafood. If I were a local, I'd come here often to try other items on the menu, just not the eggs."}, {"review_id": "LIrKrE-tYvehJmXOU98-Sw", "user_id": "ZVpNtiBfrwPWcZIVkHVAyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Although menu items are out of the ordinary, I love this place.

Quality was very good, well seasoned and properly prepared. The center of plate portions (foie gras app and rack lamb entree) were 30% too small and priced 20% too high making the experience feel unsatisfying. If you're on a schedule don't dine at the bar.

We chose to sit at the bar instead of the dining room to watch the football game and to keep the bartender company since the place was empty. My coworker ordered the filet sans parmesan crust, medium rare, which he said was good albeit a bit more well done than asked for. I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, which were a bit less crispy than I would have liked but decent. I also ordered the seafood bruschetta, which was so-so. While the amount of seafood used was impressive, the crostini wasn't toasted or grilled (essentially just old bread) and they REALLY piled on the mayo, which I didn't love.
