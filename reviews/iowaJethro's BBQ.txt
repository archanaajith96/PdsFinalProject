It's a sports bar and you are sure to find your event on. They have multiple screens, which are viewable from every seat. Its a large space with open wood rafters. It however is not a great place for a large group. The other day when I was in there was a group of 20+. They had to separate the group into 3 tables in different areas of the restaurant because they just could accommodate the group with the other customers. Food wise I've never had anything I didn't like. Their wings are my favorite, especially their garlic parmesan wings. They are a generous size and their smallest order is plenty for someone to have a meal and bring some home. Ribs are very good, but huge again. I normally get their \"rib taster\" which comes with fries as well. The ribs are moist, but not full of sauce so they aren't messy to eat. They have several types of bbq sauce right at the table. The other favorite of mine is the Gouda mushroom burger. They cook it to order, and actually know how to make a burger medium rare, which isn't common in Des Moines. Overall I would for sure recommend this place if your looking for good food and aren't too worried about atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "ZTvTC3kslNOmLAme7BOUFw", "user_id": "uxd3NpEROuDQnnPjz_Yu3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "I have to admit that I was a little weary of trying another subpar BBQ place. JETHRO'S is the real deal BBQ. If you are in Des Moines this is a must stop. In fact I plan on making a return visit before I leave town. The smoked wings are the best I ever had - Anywhere. I love a crips skin on my wing. The ribs were great the meat pulled easily away from the bones and the sauce was a sweet glaze not overpowering. Come for the BBQ because the sides were underwhelming. I had the Mac and cheese and coleslaw both were ho-hum. Service was great but I'm going back for the wings and to try the smoked pork belly sliders. If you are in Des Moines run don't walk to JETHRO'S."}, {"review_id": "SRvDPvwLU8b7radt10rXyg", "user_id": "QhURh6ghEamoj38guCWzGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Food: Half priced wings on Thursdays is about the only time I ever come here, and would definitely say that the Garlic Parmesan and BBQ rub are on point.

It reminded me of a chain knockoff BBQ joint.  The Des Moines Melt was a 5 star sandwich.  I saw a gentlemen eating a Pork Fritter sandwich which was literally the size of his plate.  I just didn't have enough stomach for that.  Lol  It had the atmosphere to potentially be a really fun place.  Our waitress was slow and not the friendliest, short with us, almost like she was thinking about other things!  They were not extremely busy so there should have been no excuses.  We still made it a fun visit though.  Clean place, prices were reasonable, and tons of food options......"}, {"review_id": "JeDfTUJPOfj3KzN62yZZVA", "user_id": "rbrYf0HvH6WuBO19DxAsGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "Love this place.  Daily specials and pick your fav location...however the original by Drake is always the best.

The hostess was on top of things and we got a seat within few minutes. When we sat down we immediately noticed that the AC was blowing cold air right on top of us so if you don't like that make sure you sit at a table not directly over a vent. Our food took a long time to come out but when it did it was very good and flavorful except for  Mac and cheese which was extremely salty.

The service was great. Our server was attentive enough without being overbearing, showed up at just the right moments, and even engaged with the baby (I always appreciate staff who aren't horrified that I've brought a kid with me). However, the entire place was sticky. Most disgusting high chair I've ever experienced. I feel like all of us needed to bathe after dinner, and not because we were eating barbecue.I ordered the Iowa Pork Platter - three ribs, sliced ham, and pulled pork with baked beans, mashed potatoes, and a corn muffin. The pulled pork was pretty good, and I enjoyed trying it with the different available barbecue sauces. The sliced ham was delicious - definitely my favorite thing on the plate. The ribs were a challenge. They were incredibly tender (yay!) to the point that they were really difficult to eat (boo). And the dry rub on them was insanely peppery - so much so that I couldn't give any to the baby, and that I hardly touched it myself. If you know me, you know that's a big stinking deal. Friends got the wings (parmesan garlic) and ribs combo and the Texas Dip (meh). Jethro's isn't a place I'd frequent, but it fit the bill for the meat-heavy meal we wanted."}, {"review_id": "X6XMeBl_Mw0byE42HG-AsQ", "user_id": "ncDzqfJv_kj6ZN4OpqrLfw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "Since they opened Jethro's BBQ 'n Jambalaya \"on the Waukee side of West Des Moines\" we've been pretty regular patrons. It's just an easy going place, with a lot of activity plus a lot of other things on the menu besides BBQ (which is good because their BBQ isn't the best you can get in town). A very casual, comfortable environment with pretty friendly people. It's a cavernous place at the end of a strip mall. It must hold 300 people, and that also seems to be their Achilles heel. When the place is moderately busy you'll usually get a well prepared meal, served pretty quickly. When the place is packed it can become a food factory. They even brag about how big the fryers are there, the grill, etc. So on those days the food comes out fast, but often sloppily prepared and maybe even under cooked. We've taken out of town friends there, because it is kind of a novelty type place, and fun. Sometimes we'll get a great meal, sometimes we're embarrassed we didn't try something else . The inconsistency is what keeps this a 3-star place instead of the 4-star place. If you're looking for a fun place, a good place for kids, with some good menu items you won't find elsewhere it's worth a try. If you don't like drinking out of a jar, eating off a tin plate, or have to wait for a table try some of the other casual dining places in the area and come back when they aren't so busy. And ask for a real glass."}, {"review_id": "efmqkXBbZ_qjVlkJhSkakQ", "user_id": "YzjroiYF6kjLhWlFt3gwQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/24/2017", "text": "Jethros is definately a staple here in Des Moines. My only critisism is that sometimes the service is on point and others its lacking. Overall though, the food is excellent. I love their boneless wings with their dry bbq rub. Its far from dry, but gives the chicken the best flavor ever. I do not, however enjoy this rub as much at their sister locations. The Drake neighborhood location makes their food the best! I also really enjoy their Jalapeno Cream Corn and Mac and Cheese. My entire family enjoys going here and thats a plus because we all have such different tastes. Works out really well on family night.

I ordered the two meat dish consisting of brisket, susage with mac and cheese and baked beans for $13.95. The brisket had no smoke ring and no flavor, I almost think that they forgot to put the rub on it. The sausage was like chewing cardboard and had no smoke flavor. The baked beans were burnt and had way to much smoke flavoring added. The mac and cheese was good but was cold, as was all of the food. The service was good, that's the only reason the review is getting two stars. Normally when I go to bbq places, and I go to a lot, I walk out stuffed, not the case here.
