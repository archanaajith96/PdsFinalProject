I've tried quite a bit of the menu and everything I tried is delicious! My favorites would have to be the orange chicken, sweet and sour pork, and the fried rice! This is the definitely the best Chinese food I've had in New Mexico. Great service and atmosphere also.

The atmosphere is great, and the food was amazing. I had the house fried rice so I could try their bbq pork, beef, chicken and shrimp all at once. This was hands down the best fried rice Ive ever had. I love this gem of a place, even my wife stepped out of her comfort zone and tried a Thai pineapple dish, she loved it. The real test will be if she eats the leftovers tomorrow (She never does)  I cleaned my generously portioned plate like a glutton, its just once I started shoveling it in I couldn't stop until the plate was cleaned. I cannot wait to come back, I wonder if you'll love it too."}, {"review_id": "6pcaTrNUH-cY_Jbe6TC04A", "user_id": "3FJAPxw92tBvMq-XjkCXbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "I have passed this restaurant everyday for a year and have always doubted it by the appearance from the outside.

We had terrible luck in the past finding the doors closed for various reasons.  The reviews and recommendations made me want to try this place. We started out with the Fiji platter, always a good indicator of what to try. The foil chicken was great, the shrimp was good, the satay chicken was average and the pork egg roll was rancid. I asked my wife to make sure it was not just my taste buds. No, the oil it was fried in was rancid. we let our server know, she called the manager and she told me that was impossible, the oil is clear and changed daily. I explained to her that even if the oil was from a new bottle, it could have gone rancid. She continued to argue.We had already ordered our entrees, so I was hoping they would be great, this many people cannot be wrong. I ordered the Pad Thai, extra hot/spicy, the server said I would not be able to handle it and said I should order the hot. When it cam out, it looked like vermicelli with tomato sauce. my hope was that it did not taste like that. The noodles were short and soggy, the heat was non-existent and the flavor was just terrible. This is not Pad Thai. I pushed my plate to the edge of the table, the manager asked what was wrong, I explained that this must be the wrong entree as I had ordered Pad Thai, extra spicy. She told me that in fact that was there version of Pad Thai and every restaurant makes it different. I told her that was the worst Pad Thai I had ever had and was not happy with it. She continued to lecture me and tell me that I was wrong and I should have told them I was unhappy, What was the past three minutes of talking about the plate about then. She never offered to remake my plate, offer a new entree, she did not remove the entree from my check. We paid for our check and left. On a side note, my wife's entree was okay, not anything I would return for.  I am seriously baffled as to the number of great reviews. It will take a lot for me to make a return trip and give them a chance for redemption. I will stick with a Taste of Thai in Enchanted Hills."}, {"review_id": "1wGz6n49vaR6fgDvYstEcw", "user_id": "1UlzL84Mv47zIS2g-nIa7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "First visit was a carry out.

I'd always thought that this was another little hole in the wall place - likely decent food but not really too different.

I'm so glad I did. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.

Atmosphere was wonderful, portions are huge, and service is superb. You can't go wrong with this place. We were welcomed immediately and seated promptly. Both waitresses were super friendly and always checking on us. Our glasses were never empty. This is on my top list of places to come back to. Parking is hard to access. If you miss the exit you have to circle around so that is annoying. I had the Japanese udon noodles with chicken. I'm not a fan of the thick noodles so next time I know I'm going to try something with rice instead. If you have hankering for Thai, Chinese, or Japanese cuisine they have you covered. And with so many choices you can come back several times to try each kinds of food. Portions were a good size too.
