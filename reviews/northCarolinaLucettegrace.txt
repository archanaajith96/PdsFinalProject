My husband and I were roaming downtown for First Friday and popped in after dinner for a dessert. We tried a dessert that was chocolate and hazelnut flavored but I can't remember the name. We also got a couple macarons to share and a latte. First of all that cake - holy crap it was delicious. I mean the flavors were so perfectly balanced and it totally melted in your mouth. Have you ever eaten at a place with impeccable presentation but the flavor disappoints? Not Lucettegrace. They nail both beauty and taste. The macarons were the best I've ever had. Latte was great too - I believe they use Larry's coffee beans. I will absolutely be back ASAP!"}, {"review_id": "8cfDQTlFyeM2zsbBwMiiew", "user_id": "Zt8kRfpqdL7cULnAS2f5AQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Came here to grab desserts on a Saturday evening.We got the \"Larry Meets Escazu\" which was excellent and some macarons.

Their display case is beautiful and makes you want to order everything. I got the Larry Meets Escazu pastry. Inside was layers of Escazu dark chocolate mousse, Larry's coffee crème brulee, brownie cake, cocoa cake, and Irish cream! It was so delicious but sooo sweet. My friend got the Candy Bar Cake (chocolate hazelnut praline mousse, praline chocolate crunch, brown butter cake, and praline cream) and Cannelé (vanilla rum cake), which were good as well, but the Larry Meets Escazu topped them both."}, {"review_id": "JYcJw7bte9bL1WpHr-SKRA", "user_id": "78dSO1f1Y5h0sYmUbxMhSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "A lovely gem in downtown Raleigh. Although it's pricier than your average local bakery, it's a standout. This is probably the only French-style patisserie in the area, which means all the offerings are works of art! The space is quite minimalistic and modern, and lots of patrons were on their laptops-- a cool place to work and chill. I've had their croissants and other morning bakery staples--all very good! My husband has also brought home some of their fancy desserts. I can't remember their names, but they were very good as well. Five stars, especially because it occupies a unique niche in the Triangle."}, {"review_id": "-ej4kZIZ0EpxAkN7heh3wg", "user_id": "00hsfCx5LzNYFlXaArYsww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Guys, they have Baklava croissants.

It's a small-ish shop, display case in the center, counter seats at the front and side, and few tables along the wall.  Whimsical decorations, and the aroma of DELICIOUSNESS everywhere. The salted caramel brownie was a slice of luscious triple chocolate brownie drizzled with caramel ganache.  Melt in your mouth rich chocolateness with a hint of salt to accentuate the caramel.  The strawberry mousse pastry was an oval of smooth, light and creamy mousse, topped with slices of fresh strawberry and surrounded by slivers of white chocolate. Paired with a caramel latte - because why not -  OUTSTANDING. $11 for a pastry and a latte, but worth every single calorie!  Can't wait to come back to try some of the other goodies."}, {"review_id": "MDxV4p4W7CeLzEWClSO7Yw", "user_id": "kLm3B6LeboEZWX_4otpILA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Wife and I stopped by here for coffee and a dessert before dinner.

The fresh and unique flavors are so neat and tasty! We've had several different sweets including the pastries, some of the breads and croissants, and even a couple of their cakes. We recently had a friend get married and his wife literally just moved here from Shanghai. They googled how to write something sweet in Mandarin. And they wrote it in chocolate on their cake.

Each slice is so precisely assembled and the flavors are amazing. We've had their cakes couple of times in the past and have always loved it. This time around, we stopped for brunch. Unfortunately their brunch selection was pretty limited. They had a curry chicken sandwich which had unique flavors of pistachio and cranberry. Overall the sandwich was good. The bourbon pecan croissant was a little too sweet for my taste. The rose macaroon was great! The butternut squash soup was like no other.... They had pickled garlic or onions topping which added a nice flavor. The highlight was obviously there candy bar pastry.... It was sooo good!!!! Again, we've always loved the pastries here. However I think their brunch or lunch options are pretty limited. I wish they expand into providing more savories options as well"}, {"review_id": "F8V1gGlEx2FP5-aIqeRX8w", "user_id": "7zpYVvj8q0caRk_cgtyO5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "Finally got to go here when I was in downtown Raleigh.

I ordered -Lemon Meringue Tart - beautiful presentation all around. The lemon filling is very smooth and that perfect slightly oozy consistency. The flavor has a lot of great lemon notes that come through well, but just slightly too salty. The crust is the perfect balance - not too hard or too soft. Overall great dessert.Choux Pouf - I dont remember the full name of this cream puff but there was fantastic incorporation of tropical flavors. The ratio between cream and choux pastry was perfect. The cream was light (not super heavy) and I loved the tropical fruit flavors.Curry Chicken Sandwich - good tasting curry flavor in the filling. I really liked the filling actually - good amount of chicken to sauce. The croissant was a tad burnt though.Decor: this place was so cute and clean! Loved the deco theme and it even showed in the cutlery.Service: the people were very nice and they bus the dishes for you.It is a tad pricey for what you get, which is why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5."}, {"review_id": "cs-fz2q9KTvP8V_TfGFvLA", "user_id": "oOqCDATE_x6UzviOzc43Cw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "DIXIE CANNONBALL. If you get anything, get that. Get there earlier in the day, they run out of them. I've frequented Lucette Grace a time or so for exactly that, the Dixie Cannonball. I work downtown so have to control myself as I'd probably become a Dixie Cannonball myself. Love their lunch options as it's simple but done right. The staff is superb too! I love the decor and vibe of Lucette Grace that I decided to take a couple of engagement photos inside, the staff was super friendly, fun and accommodating to us (and maybe even a little weirded out) but the photos look amazing and we are thankful they allowed us to do so.

But I'm glad it's worth it! First, the service here is SUPER good! All the staff are very friendly. They answered our questions patiently and didn't rush us to put order it make decision! Great service!Now, let's talk about macarons. I am a great​ fan of french macarons. I can drive one hour to eat a good macarons! To me, my favorite is always the pistachio flavor, as it works very well with almond flour and is not overwhelmingly sweet. However, I'm a little disappointed with the pistachio flavor here, as its filling is too thick and too sweet. I don't tatse much pistachio flavor from it, just sugar! While I was disappointed, the birthday cake flavor cheered me up again. The filling is slightly creamy and not too sweet. It does fill like a cake! The pineapple coconut flavor is also good, very pineapple and fruity. The caramel one is ok, nothing special. In general, the macarons here are ok, not the worse nor the best.I also ordered the Dixie cannonball per Yelp reviews! It was good! I can definitely see why a lot people like it! Very fluffy outside and juicy inside! There is really running liquid inside that takes like lighter version of sasuage gravy. I like it. I would have enjoyed it more if it was a cold day. For a super hot summer day, it feels too heavy and too greasy to me. But nothing with the food, it's just a wrong timing!I'm not sure whether I would drive to downtown to eat here. But if I'm around, I would come to try the chocolate croissant, which looks super fluffy and delicious!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/lucettegrace-raleigh?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
