Located in the middle of Korea town.My friend and I got out of the Uber and saw the original storefront had a close sign posted up. A male worker sat outside and directed us over to the temporary location (as he mentioned the old spot was being renovated)! It seemed shady at first but helped us out, so thankful for that because it was yummy! Very friendly staff and quick to serve, quickly got our food.In terms of the ramen, not very impressed but with the sricha and red chili sauce, it got more flavor and the flavor I was looking for.This is cash ONLY!

Apart from the that once inside the service was quick and efficient and the servings are very generous. And I had some left for the next day.

The tomato vegan ramen was SPOT on and so delicious; I think I like it more than the spicy sesame.This place is awesome for vegans and omnivores alike! I came on 2 occasions, so I was able to try BOTH vegan options.SPICY SESAME:This was my introduction to Daikokuya, and it certainly left an impression. The ramen was spicy, but not the \"burn your face off\" kind of spicy. It was mild. The broth was comforting and the noodles had a great chewy texture. I wish there were more veggies, but besides that, the ramen met my expectations.TOMATO:I was hesitant to try this, because I was worried it would taste like marinara sauce; I was also very intrigued, and my curiosity won out. My goodness I am glad I had this. It was delicious. The broth had a tomato flavor but it was savory and not overpowering. The arugula added a nice bitterness to the broth and the cooked zucchini and tomatoes were a delicious touch. I highly recommend giving the ramen a good STIR once you get your bowl. It seemed like the broth \"settled\" so that the more broth I had and the farther down the bowl I got, the thicker and saltier the broth became. Give it a good mix and you should be fine. I think this one was my favorite of the two, and I would highly recommend it.NOTE: This place is CASH ONLY, but there's an ATM inside. Bathrooms are towards the back of the restaurant. People must wait outside and all members of the party must be there to be seated. Also, come early to put your name down on the list. The first time I came, it was 9:30pm and my table of 4 was seated at 10:30pm. The second time, it was 6:30pm and we were seated by 6:45pm. Not sure why that was the case, but come early and hungry."}, {"review_id": "2Gn0uZDEIOwUASB80VtfrQ", "user_id": "gtOWPcyGWVP1Jx8b1jfY4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Came here on a Friday afternoon right around 11am - opening time but they opened maybe 15-20 minutes later. I'm not sure if that's a regular thing or not but I do recommend coming early because there was a sizeable line already and we were one of the last people to make it in before the cut off.We got the housemade gyoza, spicy miso ramen, and daikokuya ramen combo with pork chashu rice bowl.The housemade gyoza is really good and unlike any other gyoza I've ever had. If you're a fan of gyoza, you should definitely try it. It's about $6.50 so it is more expensive than usual but worth a try at least once. The gyoza are rectangular shaped and fried on one side. The skin is very thin and nicely crispy. Inside are pork and vegetable meat balls which tasted average. The entire dish is topped with green onions and they give you gyoza sauce to go with it. It's like a sweet soy sauce but not as sweet as other places. It was very light.The spicy miso soup was alright. It came with a few bamboo shoots, chashu, green onions, and a hard boiled egg. They gave us the egg entirely, not cut in half like usual or like in the photos so I thought that was kinda weird. It was also boiled almost all the way through so it wasn't really runny either. The broth itself wasn't too spicy but it did have good flavor. Not spicy at all if you're a spice lover like myself. The noodles were good though, they were egg based noodles and thicker and chewier.The daikokuya ramen was a lot more flavorful than the spicy miso. However, it tasted even better when we added the spicy miso bomb. It was like a blast of flavor with spiciness.The pork chashu rice bowl was pretty good too! It was more of a donburi type of rice bowl so it came with egg and a sweet sauce. I really liked it but there were a few pieces of pork that were a little dry.Overall, this place was a good restaurant to try and definitely recommend if you haven't tried but there wasn't anything that was super amazing that I would make the effort to come back for."}, {"review_id": "4ovEaS1Drf-K2oowpTR75w", "user_id": "YKP-L8m8ROyh4DqkiRwVog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Finally bit the bullet and waited in line on a Saturday night around 7:30. They said the wait would be 40 min and I buckled down for a long wait, but it turned out to only be about 20!!!!! Yay!Food: This is the best ramen in LA - definitely worth the wait. The broth has perfect umami taste and is rich but not too thick. The noodles are the right texture. Even their eggs and bamboo are somehow better than other places. The portion size is pretty big too and I could only eat about half of mine. We were pretty hungry so we got the combo and shared a salad and katsu bowl. The salad was nothing to write home about but the rice and katsu were great too.Ambience: It's very Japanese and cute. The restaurant is pretty small, with only a few little tables and booths. They have a lot of old Japanese movie posters and little figurines. I like that it feels homey and the focus is on the ramen."}, {"review_id": "lCVQ-5Ht1J7Q-Q0GuuA3Gg", "user_id": "IdFl0SfIdZ52L3sdfA9k_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "I ordered the Daikoku ramen. The broth was savory and creamy, but very slightly on the salty side. Noodles were tender, and the marinated boiled egg (my personal favorite part of any ramen bowl) was well prepared. I came in on a chilly day and my ramen bowl definitely hit the spot. Service was fantastic, despite how busy the restaurant was my server was very attentive throughout my visit. The line can get really long, so be warned. The waiting list is inside, just put your name down and they'll call your name when a table opens up. Make sure to bring cash as well, the restaurant is cash only (there is an ATM in the back if you forget). If you're in the area and craving ramen, this place is worth a consideration.

I had the Daikoku Ramen and he got the Spicy Miso Ramen (because he likes his tongue to be on fire ).  It was a delicious, but I did wish that they put a bit more pork belly in mine.

I used to go often before I turned vegan and once I turned vegan I was sad I wouldn't be able to eat there anymore. But they have two vegan ramen options and I was sooooo excited to try it. I have to say it was pretty damn amazing. I normally like the ramen at silver lake ramen more but this vegan ramen blew me the hell away. I wish I could've finished it. The fact that they gave me this much green onion alone is a god send bc I LOVE green onion!! We went around 5pm so not quite the dinner rush yet but we still waited about 15-20 min. Our party had 5 people though which is probably why! The service is great, everyone there is so friendly, the food is excellent, and it's in my favorite part of LA. what's there to dislike about this place? I love how they have kitschy Japanese pop cultural references on the walls and throughout the restaurant to add to the very authentic feel of eating in a small ramen shop in japan.

Daikokuya is located in 1st street in Little Tokyo. There are street parking but it's literally impossible to get a spot so I recommend yelping the parking structures around here. Parking structures often charge $10 flat rate on weekends and cheaper on weekdays. You can see dozens of people standing in front of Daikokuya. You must sign in to be seated once there's space. There's a clipboard inside by the entrance. I often sign in and explore Little Tokyo and come back after 20-30 min and still wait about 10-15min. There isn't much ramen selection but they are all good. I recommend the original daikoku ramen with kotteri which adds more flavor. I have never tried miso ramen from here so I'll definitely try that next time. I got the spicy sesame vegan ramen with takoyaki. The service is fast especially when there's always people waiting to get service. The vegan ramen was surprisingly delicious. Other vegan ramen usually are bland and not good but the vegan ramen broth and noodles are amazing. Best ramen for vegans as well. The daikoku ramen is delicious as well and that's my #1 recommendation. There's free ginger and garlic at every table. Best ramen in the area."}, {"review_id": "otW03iEYBuLNUJDQcddpEw", "user_id": "3z_lnCPq7lgeNlOzKLBLfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Unique and tastyPros: Decent sized portions and good quality food. Everything is fresh and made to order. The broth is unique and definitely has a taste that is significantly different from the rest of the ramen that I've eaten at other places. You're given a good amount of meat and there are plenty of other options to go in combination with the different types of ramen that they have. Cons: The wait. Be prepared to wait regardless of time and day. At night especially during Friday to Sunday the line will sometimes almost wrap around the block. Parking is always a hassle in LA. Expect to pay to park anywhere.Bottom line: Very nice ramen. It's in the heart of Little Tokyo which is nice. Makes it easy to wander around and find other things to do while you wait to be seated. Will definitely come here again if I'm in the area and if it's possible without too long of a wait."}, {"review_id": "EWl0X0gLQ0VrA1QqjyekxA", "user_id": "JhxmQdVUBQXAYC_EiHvnoA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "The one star is for the hostess.

The hostess alternated calling parties by their names and their respective numbers on the list. Her voice is extremely soft and even as I was standing 5-10 feet away from her, it was difficult to hear her but I couldn't get much closer since people were waiting outside as well.Eventually she \"called\" our names and we couldn't hear because of her low voice. I went in and informed her that we were standing nearby but couldn't hear our names. She acknowledged that and continue to seat at least four parties that came after us. By then, I went in again and apologized to bother and asked when we would be seated. She sassed me and said \"yeah later, just wait\". Very frustrating. She didn't apologize or seemed to care at all.

Why? This place serves authentic ramen and the taste is pretty on point. I've learned to beat the rush by coming 30 minutes before dinner time on the weekdays and weekends. This place is small, so they turn tables much slower. But I warn you - this place is NOT worth the hour wait. It's like any other ramen place, but more hyped. There are 3 other ramen places in the same district (walking distance) if you're super hungry too. As for food, the Daikokuya ramen (I forgot the exact name but it's their original and most popular) was good. Sometimes it's a little salty and other times - it's well balanced. I absolutely love their flavored egg and will typically order 2 for myself. The green onion topping makes this noodle soup very aromatic. The pork is juicy and packed with tons of flavor, but can be super fatty at times. Sometimes, I'll order the tsukemen if I want something more hearty and creamy. I think this place does well with their tsukemen, but make sure you get warm noodles so the broth soaks better when you dip it. It comes with two pieces of pork.Bless yourself and order their takoyaki! I love how crunchy this place makes it. We tried the house soju, but it tasted a little weird. More like bitter, hot medicine than normal soju.

From all the things she was saying and the plethora of great reviews on yelp, my expectations were set pretty high.When we arrived, there was around a 45 minute wait, which was fine because we just went to walk around the Japanese Village Plaza. We were seated around 5 minutes after we returned and were left alone for about another 5 minutes. This was fine to me because they were extremely busy on a Saturday night, but my friend told me she was upset about being ignored by the waitresses.When they finally took our order, my friend got the  daikoku ramen while I got the combo daikoku ramen and teriyaki elbowl. The food took about 10 minutes to come out. The ramen noodles were very chewy and I noticed they gave a lot of toppings. However, the dish was $12 which was a little overpriced for regular ramen, but I guess the increased portion and amount of toppings makes up for it.The eel bowl was very flavorful, but I was surprised at the small size of the bowl. It was about the same size as when you order a side of rice at most restaurants. The eel was also another whopping $12 added to the $12 of the ramen. I understand eel prices have risen but that price is kind of ridiculous for the tiny portion you get. I also saw that the menu said combos include a salad but I never got one. If they were going to call this a combo, the price of $24 for just ramen and a small eel bowl with no salad is too much.Overall, the food was great but the service is what brought my review down to 3 stars. The waitresses did not come back and ask if we needed anything or refill my friend's water that she finished within the first 10 minutes of arriving. When we tipped a little less for their service (around $3-4), the waitresses scoffed when they saw it and started talking among themselves. They then \"reminded\" my friend in a haughty tone that tip was not included in the bill. I understand it was a busy Saturday night, but this wasn't the type of service I was expecting to receive from a restaurant with such high reviews."}, {"review_id": "cgcoO68bsMd90laVs1EK6w", "user_id": "U2bQdMhYACNjhOcG_bWdcA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Everytime we visit Little Tokyo it's always packed.

My family and I visited this ramen shop as we were on our way back to San Diego.Street parking was a little bit of a pain in this area, so we ended up parking in the parking garage. We came at an odd time, I think it was around 4 or 5pm, so there wasn't a long wait for a party of 5. I think we waited about 10 mins.Figuring out what to order was easy for me. Whenever I visit a ramen restaurant, I almost always get the staple tonkotsu ramen or as it's listed here, Daikoku Ramen. I also added kotteri flavor and extra chashu pork, both I feel are a must. The kotteri flavor adds soup that is extracted from the back fat, and well there is never enough chashu!The ramen came out quick, in a large bowl. Presentation was it's strong suit, but the food spoke for itself. The broth was nice and fatty, though I felt like the broth was on the thin side. I would've like a thicker creamier broth. I felt like the standout item in the bowl was the chashu. I would say, probably the best chashu I've ever had in a bowl of ramen. I feel like chashu is normally sliced pretty thin, but this one was nice and thick! Oh and it was fatty too!All in all, I enjoyed my bowl of ramen and wouldn't mind coming back.
