Did I mention this is a BBQ place? This meat was not smoked at all. Please do not think I am complaining that I like my meat with a deep red smoke line and a thick crunchy bark (incidentally I do BTW). No, I mean this meat had not been smoked at all. I will let this sink in for a moment.Ok, so as I was feeling a bit peckish, I also ordered the half chicken. It was very moist and flavorful, but guess what - ok, you saw this coming. IT WAS NOT SMOKED! It seemed to have been cooked on a rotisserie and maybe finished on a grill, as there was some charring. I guess I have to comment on my side - mac and cheese. Kraft comes to mind. 'Nuff said.\"Other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play...\" As I said, it was warm inside and they did have good sweet tea."}, {"review_id": "FgpQFF4iGPTM6Y5EZy4JVA", "user_id": "A0ZqrZiMDix5HXBar2LcnQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "My wife and I a very poor dinner at Whole Hog.  The chicken sandwich was ok,,, I had the Cole Slaw and Potato Salad for sides-- potato salad had to much mayo and the slaw too sweet.  Both tasted like they were pre-packaged and not store made.  I would not order them again.  My wife ordered a loaded Baked Potato-- it came out a room temperature at best.  Would not even melt the butter much less the Cheese or Sour Cream.   The Potato was waxy-- like it was cooked in a Microwave.  I would not recommend this Bar B Q at all!"}, {"review_id": "sIZhsEGB9jpPia0ZefIA1g", "user_id": "vO1MrQHjE1auSiICMvvX-g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "I had a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on it and it was pretty amazing but unfortunately it was just not what I was expecting. Of course I am used to either Carolina BBQ with the vinegary tang, and Texas BBQ with the sauce brisket. I did think that for being my second BBQ stop in Arkansas that it was not too bad.The potato salad was amazing though but I could have done without their baked beans. My girlfriend actually grills the best baked beans I have ever had. If I had to try it again, I would just get the pulled pork without the coleslaw or sandwich and just eat it with the sweet sauce. However, I have had better BBQ at SweetPeas in Kirby and even Dickey's BBQ. I will not be coming back here but if you are in dire need of BBQ, I am sure it should at least hold you over."}, {"review_id": "rnNAy6mKmvi-QtJK0DuYqw", "user_id": "K1DGtp_FOLdVHEGy3AcQlw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "It's a tad bit overrated still good though.. one thing that's not is the RIBS!

That being said, this place is pretty dang good. The portions are HUGE and prices are very reasonable. They give you a ton of meat. The potato salad was one of the best potato salads ever. The macaroni salad was very bland and tasted chewy. My pulled pork was pretty good, but I've had a stomach ache since eating there. The other problem I had with this place is the mold growing on the bathroom sink.

I came here because I saw it had great reviews while I was stopping over night in Little Rock. I should have eaten anything else but here.It's located in a strip mall. We came here for dinner and sure signs I should have known to stay away was there was hardly anyone here for dinner time. The store has a ton of BBQ trophy's lining the room, which completely fools you to thinking this place is going to be good. I'm surprised there are so many trophy's, since it appears to be a chain with multiple locations throughout the state. I ordered the Ultimate Platter, since I figured it gave me a good sample of just about everything they had to offer. Hmm where to begin, everything was cold. Not a single item was hot or remotely warm. The cheesy corn was watery corn. The baked beans were nasty. The roll was about the only okay thing on the whole platter. The meats were all cold. The ribs were dry. The chicken was dry and tasteless. The beef, I'm not even sure I even got any. The pork was also cold and tasteless. The potato salad was marginally okay. Everything was terrible. Even the atmosphere was terrible. I have no idea how this place got sure great reviews. Everything was awful, from the food, to the atmosphere to the seating. The presentation of the food was just as bad as the taste of the food. I would never come back nor recommend this place to anyone. If it were possible to give this place 0 stars, I would."}, {"review_id": "mfWIRi38r0wupldIpPhxBw", "user_id": "3JMUCM-5EwkL_TIL9GaoQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Had to lower my rating from five star to four.

The sausage sucked, it was overcooked and tough.One shining part about this restaurant is the service was very very good. The ladies working were over-the-top friendly.

I was on the plane and talked about bbq with the guy seated next to me. He's a Texan, the lady behind me is native Little Rock. I started a bbq war and had to listen to them argue about bbq for the rest of the ride. But I appreciated the advice and asked about it with the locals who all agreed it is a must try.The place is in a nice strip mall. The outside was simple, but you open the door and the smoked meat smell just hits you. The staff was super warm and friendly. They really captured the spirit of the Southern charm that you hear about.They made all the recommendations and I didn't even need a menu. I ordered the 4 rib plate with a \"taste\" of pulled pork. It wasn't a taste, it was a full order of pulled pork for just $2.95 extra. I also got the baked beans and potato salad. The proprietor proudly boasted he sells as much potato salad as meat. He explained the potato salad was big chunks of potato and bacon. Did he say bacon? I was sold. He then explained the sauce system. They lay out 6 sauces on the table, but the 7th sauce, the volcano, was kept behind the counter and only available on request because it's super hot. I told him it's ok, keep it.  Last thing I want is to spend the rest of the night in pain in my hotel room.So my number gets called and I go get my order... Oh man... Does it look good.  The ribs have that professional glazed glistening meat look on that only a professional place can do.  I rush back to my table and go to town.I dig into the potato salad... Instant heaven.  The big chunks of potato were cooked perfectly.  Then you hit the bacon.  Not bacon bits.  Bacon slices.  Perfect balance to the more starchy and bland tasting potato.  I could eat this all day if it weren't for my strict diet.The beans were also very delicious.  Slow cooked with that sweet molasses taste.Now... The ribs... What can I say.  They have tons of trophies and the ribs definitely explain it.  Fall off the bone tender, with tons of flavor.  Good BBQ don't need no sauce!However, being that there were 6 sauces, I tried them on the meats.  My favorite has to be the classic standby #3 of traditional vinegar and southern spices.  Delicious.  The #6 ain't bad either with mustard and vinegar.  The rest were good, but I am dig the vinegar more than tomato based sauces.The pulled pork wasn't as much of a hit.  It was not that tender.  I ate it with the sauces and it was good, but after the ribs, it just didn't make an impression on me.Too bad I didn't have more time.  I want to come back and try the rest of the menu.  The service was great and the nice gentleman cleaning my table gave me a to go cup for my drink.If you are in town, go to this place.  No ifs, ands, or buts about it."}, {"review_id": "fHU6Z0JWDA4HI1KRojpD7A", "user_id": "vJxkwq-GmWNqHy3-rDdAjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/30/2016", "text": "Being from out of town I had to rely on Yelp to find some decent BBQ in Little Rock.
