Coffee was OK, but the pastry was good. The thing that most put me off was that they had many signs around the cafe telling customers how to act: \"students don't spread out your stuff\", \"this table is for groups of more than 2\", \"WiFi only available on weekdays\", \"pay for your books before reading in the cafe\".  It felt unwelcoming. The more I looked around, the more petty signs I found. I came back on the weekend to buy one of the Chris Bovey prints. They didn't show me the print before packing it up, but I later noticed some the ink had been cut off close to the corner. I went back in to exchange it, and they were very obviously not happy with me. All prints are individual, but generally the customer picks out the one with features that stand out most to them. In the end, I was able to exchange but had to endure some sarcastic comments from the ladies behind the counter. Just a word of warning when shopping for prints here."}, {"review_id": "UrJbx-SZ_Kkjj3CjGyRl_A", "user_id": "WT2dNEodFZtISzRPBBtqZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Atticus is the preeminent spot in Downtown to shop for little chachkies, and peruse the endless supply of candles.

I am, without a shadow of doubt, a big big fan :)Apart from that, the shop in the front is so cute .. and those coffee and teas that they sell are absolutely amazing.Also, the vegetarian (lacto veggie) choices of sandwich they have is really amazing .. wife is a vegetarian and it really feels so good.The other day we had a mocha and tried their fresh brewed tea (mint and lemon) .. shared a pesto cheddar sandwich lightly toasted, everything of which was perfect .. started right from their service btw :)Nothing much else to say, except - A big fan right here :)PS - also, loved the fact that they stock kambucha .. well for me this kinda variety is being a true tea / coffee shop."}, {"review_id": "UxXIqYszcM6r3sYIEv6rDg", "user_id": "-u5kQutcNnqxtwi6PpV2FQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "This is such a fun, cute place with a welcoming atmosphere. I love that it double duties as a unique gift shop and a coffee shop. I found the coffee drinks to get well done, and the staff is committed to their customers' needs. It means a lot when a barista takes the time to check the syrup to ensure there isn't dairy because in some places, one might just roll their eyes. At Atticus, they do this with pleasure, and that counts a lot. They also have almond-flavored syrup, which is not always easy to find, so I can do my favorite, an all-almond latte: flavor and milk! The gift shop has a great variety of thoughtful gifts, including a lot of local goodies. I love the Spokane pride here. And I must give props to my favorite part of the whole store: pages from \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" on the walls! I truly love it."}, {"review_id": "SdXcJlW6-iqjZj8zWI7RYg", "user_id": "7Fqpu8xSLPVqCXjFFn1FtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Always super friendly and the coffee is great.

When we took it back to them, a women handed it to another employee and said taste this.  Right in front of us and let me just say I was shocked.  Also a little offset because who the hell does that???  I've always been a fan of the little shops and want to support them but I wouldn't go back to work this place if it was the only coffee shop in the state. Id switch to Tea. Haha.  It may have been a bad day for someone and I get that but when other employees say that the cookie was over a day old and then another employee says it's not- just get your story straight.  All I wanted was a cookie and not a person saying I'm wrong.
