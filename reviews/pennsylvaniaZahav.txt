My fiance and I didn't have a reservation, but decided to go early on a Saturday evening and see if we could snag a seat at the bar (which is first come-first serve). We showed up around 5:30 and actually only ended up waiting about 15 minutes before two bar seats opened up! Note that they do not allow you to stand at the bar while you wait, but they will serve you drinks in the lobby area (it can get a bit cramped though). We decided to order a la carte rather than doing the tasting menu because we didn't want the dessert course, but the tasting menu is definitely a solid deal for the amount of food you'd get. FOODWe started with the hummus which was AMAAAZING. We ordered the \"daily topping\" which was lamb and it was some of the best hummus I've ever had. The pita bread they serve it with is awesome too.For small plates we did the fried cauliflower (awesome), tuna tartare (awesome) and the haloumi (pretty good but not my favorite). We also ordered lamb, steak, and chicken skewers which were all very good and SO flavorful. Honestly by the end of the meal we were kind of overwhelmed by all of the flavors. DRINKSI ordered the \"Call Me in the Morning\" which was tequila with turmeric, lime, cucumber, and cilantro. I was nervous the turmeric would be overpowering but it wasn't at all - I loved this cocktail. SERVICEWe were at the bar so the service was very quick and the bartenders were super friendly (and helpful with explaining the menu and offering recommendations)AMBIANCEWhat I really like about Zahav is that its not overly pretentious - the vibe is actually relatively casual and relaxed. Great place to grab dinner at the bar but its also nice enough that it would work for a romantic or celebratory dinner."}, {"review_id": "6gzZ5G34af_Xg7ONQyU-Ow", "user_id": "06LdtHvxpe_u-JlR_uAP8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "While in the city and never trying Israeli cuisine we decided to try Zahav's for dinner while celebrating a relatives birthday.  The place was jammed, the atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. The staff was great and accommodating and the service was five star. We had a large party and were seated in one of their semi private rooms. They added a nice touch to the menu with a Happy Birthday printed on them. Since we had a large party we were able to order the tasting menu. They pretty much brought us everything on the menu. It started with their six daily vegetable salads and hummus trio. The vegetables were bright, vibrant and very flavorful. The hummus was very unique tasty and the fresh laffa was amazing. Next was a round of small plates consisting of fried cauliflower, smoked sable, tuna tartare, asparagus, roasted rhubarb, halloumi, kibble maya and grilled duck hearts. Each dish was prepared beautifully and the flavors and textures were amazing. The main course was roasted pomegranate lamb shoulder with chickpeas. Served with Persian wedding rice. The lamb had such great flavor and melted in your mouth. The rice had nice crispy edges and cooked perfectly. This was definitely a memorable experience! If you can get a reservation I would highly recommend it!  It was amazing!"}, {"review_id": "N1Q2Gort2fPodtkPfjj-Hw", "user_id": "wojMqIU5hJAv71o9h2mCig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Love love love.The crispy cauliflower is fried to perfection.

I experienced pure flavor Nirvana and palette ecstasy. Although I usually abhor tapas places, I was more than blown away here. The experience starts out with vegetables slices that have been pickled in a turmeric infused vinegar (carrots, celery, and artichoke hearts). I could eat them all day and they are gratis.I chose the Tayim or tasting menu which consisted of: Salatim (six different vegetable salads...you get all six); your choice of one of three hummus served with Laffa bread; your choice of two of a total of eight mezze; one Al Ha'esh (meat or meaty vegetables grilled over coals) served with rice pilaf; and, dessert. Total price $48, and worth every penny. I have a brawny appetite and I walked away with a to-go bag.Salatim, courses one through six. I do not remember all of the six salads but each one exploded with flavor, earthiness, and a great balance of salt, spices, and heat. Of note were the carrot based salad and the sliced leeks.Hummus, course seven. One of the choices is the well known Tehina hummus with olive oil. However, go with the Tehina with a daily topping choice. Today's choice was grilled (and/or smoked) cauliflower. Best hummus ever!!! Mic drop. I would not have been offended or felt taken advantage of if the meal ended there or just consisted of hummus. It is that good. The laffa bread is puffy with a bit of char from being baked in a wood-burning oven. It is then topped with salt and some spices. I mopped the hummus bowl dishwasher clean with that bread and should have asked for more.Mezze course eight. I had the smoked sable fish. It was good and seemed to be well prepared, but it was not what I thought. In the challah bread, on top of which the smoked fish was mounded, was a runny yoke of an egg. Not my favorite egg preparation so, after a trial bite, I moved that small plate to the side. My waiter/bartender (I sat at the bar) noticed immediately and asked if I did not enjoy the dish. I told him I did not and he insisted that I choose a replacement. I then chose Haloumi which is a cheese that is grilled and served with walnuts and a date marmalade like sauce. Imagine the best grilled cheese you ever had that you then dipped into a sweet savory cranberry sauce. Just a damn good dish. Mezze course nine. Fried cauliflower with garlic, mint, aleppo (I know it as a great city but no idea what it means in this dish), and labneh (no idea what that is either). All I know is that the dish is great. It just made me happy eating it and I am just as happy writing about it.Al Ha'esh, course ten. I ordered the Lamb Merguez with green olive matbucha (like a green olive relish or tapenade) and fennel root slices. Lamb Merguez is the absolute perfect lamb sausage perfumed with an explosion of spices and a sweetness that I still cannot place. It was tender and juicy. The smell was just divine. The matbucha and fennel, when eaten on the same fork full as the lamb, was the zenith of this amazing meal. My mouth is still having a flavor jubilee!!!Dessert, course eleven. BEHOLD, Chocolate Olive Oil Cake. Just to launch it over the moon they added cacao nibs, kumquat slices, and malabi custard (think the best vanilla ice cream you have ever had). The cake was super moist, decadently chocolaty with a the perfect foil in the citrus sourness/sweetness of the kumquat slices. I have never, knowingly, had kumquat but they tasted so so fresh. This dessert closed the show like it was Elvis and had already left the building.The meal took over a couple of hours, great hours, to finish. The cocktail menu is well crafted. The wait may seem ridiculous but wait you must. Carve out 45 minutes or an hour; you will thank yourself that you did. I loved this place. I mean actually adore it. The food was like the best Mediterranean, Greek, and Spanish I have ever had.The absolute highlight was the knowledgeable and affable service. My waiter, Peter C (112), was my guide on this journey. With the professionalism of a great advocate and a chef like knowledge of the ingredients, preparations, and flavor profiles, he was like the stage director of this Hamiltonian production. My glass never went dry (water or wine). My many questions were addressed. He noticed my dislikes and made it right, without having to be asked. It was an honor and a true pleasure to dine with the staff. This was my first experience with cuisine that touted itself as \"Israeli.\" The kitchen staff should be very proud. For my tastebuds sake I selfishly pray that Israeli cuisine catches on throughout the country. Would that Zahav opened in my beloved D.C.!!!  Philly, please understand what a true blessing has been bestowed upon your city in the form of Zahav!!! Tourist, take a moment to put down the cheesesteaks and other Philly favorites and come pay homage at this temple of gastronomy."}, {"review_id": "2qboyAr3c9OyNQqROcmY_g", "user_id": "FIDPP65G4FxtZfqt5HwWWg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "When I was researching restaurants to dine at for our Philly trip, Zahav came up as number 1 in lots of lists. I've never tried Israeli food before, so I was excited to try!They have a \"Taste of Zahav\" deal which is $48 per person and comes with a salad, hummus, two small plates, one large plate, and dessert. It's a pretty good deal considering the hummus is $9/13, small plates are $10, large plates are $14, and desserts are $9.We opted out of the deal because we wanted to try more savory dishes than eat dessert. We ordered a bunch of small plates and some large plates to share. Standouts: hummus, fried cauliflower, kibbe naya (raw lamb), and the grilled duck hearts. Definitely nice to be able to try a bunch of dishes!

Think this time we were given the warm hummus which I think is the Turkish one?  Not as good as the hummus from last visit but still real good.  The dessert came out with 4 items with the sorbet palate cleanser in the middle along with the rich chocolate cake, a non cannoli type item and the malabi custard that was a table favourite all of which goes well with the delicious Turkish coffee.  The lamb shoulder came out with the crispy rice and we were all ready to dig in but first I had to take a blurry picture lol.  This is always on my mind of best dishes to eat but am bummed I forgot to ask if they had the off menu foie gras skewer/kabob as that would of been awesome to try but I'll have to remember for next time!"}, {"review_id": "JUyJ6XI4eZ39KvNDx8xe5w", "user_id": "QtKagQe63XFUuaQafUOuuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "I went to Zahav on New Years Day 2018 with 4 of my best friends.

First off, the restaurant is beautiful and the service is IMPECCABLE!!! We all opted for the Tayim and were able to try everything on the menu. Every dish was beautiful and delicious. The waiter introduced and explained every item, which really enhanced our dining experience. The baked hummus was out of this world!! My friend and I can't wait to try to recreate it at home.

Eventually a spot opened up for just 1 week later - Sunday at 9:15pm. This is pretty standard for Zahav, but a bit late for us. Luckily we were offered a 7:15 table on the day of because someone cancelled - see, it is possible to get a reservation here after all!We opted out of the $48 tasting menu and decided to go a la carte. We ended up paying roughly $30 pp including tax and tip for a very satisfying meal (1 hummus, 2 mezzes, 2 entrees.) By satisfying, I don't mean filling. I left feeling content from the rich flavors and reasonably full, but not bloated.Turkish hummus - very very good. Zahav knows their laffa bread, and they know their warm Turkish buttered hummus with roasted garlic atop. This was easily the best dish of the night.Smoked sable - this was a really fun dish - a six-minute egg nestled into a square of challah bread, with smoked cod and dill on top. Chicken liver - not available regularly. My boyfriend liked this but it's not something I would order since I'm not particularly into organs. It was decent though - very tender in the middle of each piece.Lamb - sad:( we thought this would be the lamb shoulder with pomegranate but it turned out to be more like a lamb kebab/korma. It was pretty dense and not as interesting/special as other dishes.Branzino - quite good fish on a bed of tzaziki sauce. I feel this could have been even more tender than it already was, and the dill was nice, but made it taste too similar to the smoked sable.Overall Zahav is good, but I'm not sure it deserves how difficult it is to get a reservation. The hummus and laffa were the highlights and if I come back, it will be for those."}, {"review_id": "sQAY0n3qUx8TDB4tq8HSFw", "user_id": "mN6RujPNIr9tPkLMj-NwGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "So this was my first time ever trying Israeli food.

It definitely lived up to the hype!We almost opted out of the Turkish hummus and I'm so glad we didn't! I was stuck between getting the stuffed cabbage or the eggplant dish so I asked my server. She recommended the eggplant dish, but they were so sweet that they gave me the stuffed cabbage dish complimentary! Now that's great service (and I actually ended up liking the cabbage dish better). My guest said the chicken dish was very flavorful too. Desert options were limited but I still got the chocolate option. It wasn't anything amazing but enough to fulfill my sweet tooth after.

Everyone wants to hang out with Zahav but not everyone can! this place is booked out for the next 3 months - and that's because that's how far they do with their reservations. This can be good and bad for the restaurant! Everyone wants to go because it's so booked and popular. But, then by the time they actually get a table, you expect a spectacular meal. Spectacular is key - setting the bar high. Hence, some of the disappointing reviews they may have! However, I loved it. Ambience: they don't have middle eastern music.  It's your american mix of radio station music - so, you hear your familiar songs, etc. the place is not extremely fancy at all - an older version of your trendy restaurant but the tables and chairs are a bit better than basic. Staff: this is where you start to see why it's so great - staff is extremely nice and cordial. From the minute you walk in and meet the hosts to the wait staff - 1-2 constantly replacing your water and plates, and then your waiter. We had the pleasure of having Ben help us. He recommended his favorite dishes as well as explained the menu well and the options of the chef's tasting menu. We also received 2-3 plates on the house! Which weren't some items - a full dessert and an additional small plate option. This brings me to the menu... why zahav is so successful.. The chef's tasting menu is an amazing deal!!!! At $48 a person, you get to try so so much, soooo come hungry! If you drink, ordering drinks along the way is where your bill may add up to - that's how and where Zahav makes the $$. But let's talk about the food already! Ok, so no pork across the menu - works for me #porkfreegirl Chef's tasting :1 choice of hummus - we did the Turkish hummus which comes with a large, freshly made pita bread toasted with Zatar on top. Ok, the Turkish hummus is a lot richer and creamier than normal hummus. It has garlic and butter. And is heavenly. At this point, you're also served with about 6 salad items - this includes things like pickled cabbage, eggplant, etc. it could be a meal, but don't fill up! Then, you get a choice of 2 mezze- small plates.  There was two of us, so we were able to choose 4 plus an additional was served on the house! Fried cauliflower: this was okay - anything fried is great. This wasn't crispy fried - just lightly battered and tasted like your usual fried cauliflower - but the mint sauce that came with it was delicious! If you like a tangy sauce.. i dipped bread and other items with it. so, if you like cauliflower - order it. Smoked sable: this was a must have! No fishy taste or smell - they place it on top of toasted bread with an egg - all the flavors went SO well together! Order it. Fluke crudo: love his as well. Very refreshing and no fishy taste or smell at all ( that's obviously important to me) order it! Roasted rhubarb: this is a tangy and refreshing taste. The flavors were definitely different - If you like a tangy and sweet mix of flavors, this would be a good option. Haloumi- grilled cheese? Always.  However, Haloumi is a thicker texture and I could eat only so much so order it if you love Haloumi or have someone to share it with. Then, you get 1 main plate: We tried the lamb merguez: which was 1 piece of \"kebab\". It was good, flavorful, and came with rice pilav. Loved it, however it needed some other type of sauce because it was a bit dry. But I love lamb so had to try it! Branzino: small piece ( may be small cuz of the tasting menu!) perfect siZe at this point because you're almost or already full. Great dish! One of my favorites. Add a bit of rice with the dish, and even better! Must order. Then, best part - desserttttt. They have 4.  We ordered 2, and got an additional on the house! Squash konafi - comes with milk chocolate ice cream - a must order if you love chocolate ice cream. The Konafi has a less sweeter taste because of the squash but the ice cream balances it well. Pomegranate sorbet - the sorbet is tangggggyyt. But if love sorbet, and pomegranate- must order. Topped with something called pishmanye, which is sweet strands of butter, flour, and sugar( totally googled this!) it's a coarser version of cotton candy. buttttt i used to eat this when i was younger!!!! And was so excited to find this in a restaurant!!!!! I enjoyed this very much. You should try it too. Malabi custard: this was my favorite! Light weight custard with many flavors. Comes with fruit, that was really good too. Their desserts are amazing  ok, I'm done."}, {"review_id": "11Q-CbhztBEc7pTOGuL11Q", "user_id": "-36-LsIQ_ZwnOWARzikPow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This was seriously one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.

I happened to be across the street in a hotel and I decided, hey why not arrive here early and try to get a bar seat. There was a small line and I got a bar seat near the edge of the bar on the right. Very nice staff who seemed to like working there as well. The bartender had some good suggestions. There was another woman there who had been to the place before and we spoke for a good time and I sampled some of her stuff (and her mine.) I eventually ordered the Tayim and the bartender thankfully told me that everything can be packed so don't bother eating too much of the Salatim as they give the same portion regardless of the number of people (outside of possibly adding another salad.) I eventually did take a lot of it home (along with some hummus/chicken/haloumi.)I don't remember the drink I had outside of it being sour and having Arak and some sour fruity flavors also. It was good.Salatim- six daily vegetable saladsLarge plate with 6 groups. Nice mix of spicy and not so spicy Mediterranean salads. They included a tomato/some other vegetable based salad (a bit like Muhammara albeit less spiced) as well as red cabbage, okra, eggplant, and a spicy cabbage (or something similar) salad. The eggplant and okra were the best of the group with the tomato being OK. The cabbage had a bit of a jarring heat but it worked as a cleanser throughout the meal.After eating a bit of each (and getting a little full) a big plate of hummus came out (and I partially thought what am I getting myself into.)Hummus- served with laffa baked in our wood-burning ovenDaily topping- (in this case) turnips braised in short rib.The laffa was well cooked though I found it a bit thick. The hummus was excellent. Frankly one of if not the best I have had. The turnips on top were delicious were a light smoky/meaty texture.Mezze: Before my next dishes came out, they gave me (as if it was necessary) some of the fried cauliflower which is one of their more popular appetizers. Fried cauliflower with labneh, garlic, mint, aleppo. - Good variation. Light fry. Good flavors albeit light spices.The rest of the Mezze:Chicken liver Pastilla:Easily my favorite of the dishes, this was a very good rendition on one of my favorite Moroccan specialties. Super rich and oh so amazing.Haloumi- grilled in filo topped with pistachio, with peach jam. I might have the wrong fruit.Good though the weakest of the two more because the other one was amazing. It could have used a bit more nuts. The filo was nice and light but still crispy. Still solid though I should have probably gotten the hearts or kibbeh.Al-Ha'esh- Chicken shishlik served with some amba of some types.Weakest of the dishes. The chicken was moist but it didn't have as much flavor outside of light fruit. I frankly didn't mind as I was getting very full but I would have been disappointed if I got this solely.After packing up the rest, I asked the bartender what he recommends for a light dessert. He recommended the Malabi which I got.Malabi custard with rosewater and pistachio/seasonal fruits (I believe this was raspberries.)Very good and nicely light. Rosewater was there but not strong.The woman (who had ordered and loved her branzino prior) got the chocolate kunafeh and we each had some of each other's desserts. It was excellent though very, very sweet. I am happy he didn't recommend it.Really good place. Some of the best Mediterranean food I have had period.4.7"}, {"review_id": "ftlCYRcGl_cyvf8g1SGPzA", "user_id": "PUDYBk_OW3dYQFNhGPaRjQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I don't know what it says about me, but scoring a reservation here left me with a HUGE sense of accomplishment.  You see, it took days of obsessively checking Opentable. Then again, my stalking skills have always been unparalleled, something am sure my ex would corroborate.  Jk. 'Cause all jokes aside, it's not every day a girl has to exert such Herculean efforts just to land a table at a restaurant.  The question is was it worth it?Well, if the meal had begun and ended with Hummus, I think I'd actually respond in the affirmative to this.  But alas, it didn't.  And so it goes:So yeah...  The Hummus here is every bit as ethereally creamy and velvety as people say.  We tried all three on offer during our visit, including Classic with Tehina, a Special topped with Roasted Grapes, and Turkish.  The latter, served warm, and enriched with melted butter, was my favorite. But all were delicious!  Next up were the Salatim, aka assortment of six small Salads. They were all either pickled or cooked.  \"There are no fresh, raw vegetables,\" noted hubby. \"Where are the cucumbers and tomatoes?  Where is the lemon to add brightness?\"  While I get that this isn't a literal interpretation of Israeli cuisine, I cannot deny that hubby makes a very valid point.  These missing ingredients are staples in every Israeli household, so it's honestly surprising they didn't inspire a 'Salat' or two among the selection we received.  Since hubby, kid, and I were doing the Tayim Tasting Menu, which entitles you to two Mezze each, we were able to try six out of the eight that were featured that night.  Honestly, only one was even remotely worthy of all the hype this place receives: The lush Smoked Sable with Challah and runny Egg.  Beautiful stuff that paid delicious homage to Israel's Eastern European culinary roots.  Everything else ranged from forgettable to downright disappointing.  I was especially looking forward to trying the Kibbeh Naya, but this traditional ground raw lamb dish tasted muddled thanks to heavy handed seasoning and the overpowering earthy flavor of beets.  We also tried Duck Hearts, which arrived cold.  Am not sure if that was intentional, but I wasn't into these.  At all.  Oh yeah, the famous Fried Cauliflower? My MIL made a version of this for hubby when he was growing up, as do many Israeli Mamas...  And well, these crisp-exteriored, flash-fried, ulitmately bland florets, about six to an order, didn't seem all that elevated to me.  Roasted Rhubarb and Fluke Crudo were fine, but not special.Next up were our Al Ha'esh picks. I enjoyed my Branzino, which boasted gorgeously crisp skin.  The kid, who much to his Mama's chagrin, could usually care less when it comes to food, practically swooned over his Hanger Steak.  But hubby's Shishlik, aka skewered cubes of Chicken Thighs, was salty AF.  And finally, dessert:  By this point, I was ready to explode, so my memory of this course is dubious.  But the Malabi I went with was a really nice riff on this popular Middle Eastern custard. The kid only offered me a tiny bite of his Chocolate Olive Oil Cake and I appreciated how moist and deeply chocolaty it was.  The only clunker, once again, was hubby's choice, Konafi.  It was cloyingly sweet.  Actually, one more thing:  LOVED the Limonana Cocktail, which had a faintly perfumey flavor the server informed me was Lemon Verbena.Speaking of our server, she was professional, patient and friendly. As the restaurant filled up, she understandably seemed more frazzled and there were some lags with the pacing of our courses, but nothing major.  Also appreciated that the Chef sent out a 'freebie' Leek dish for us to try.  Indeed. From his vantage point, hubby observed Solomonov at the expediting window, checking all the dishes that went out.  Really respect that he is still so present.  Other Random Thoughts:  Aside from a huge overhead image of Jerusalem's Machane Yehuda, I wasn't quite getting the vibe this place is going for.  As others have mentioned, the music is random. And loud. But I think it adds a certain frenetic energy that makes this restaurant feel alive.  I *sort of* liked it.  And fwiw, we showed up for our hideously early 5pm reservation looking like schleppy tourists and did not feel under-dressed, so this spot is blessedly casual.  Also fwiw, if you do a tasting menu, be prepared to commit at least two hours for your meal and then collapse into a total food coma.  Don't say I didn't warn you.Bottom line: In spite of the stumbles, this was four stars for me.  But barely, and only 'cause I know I'd be willing to return.  Though next time I'd go the a la carte route.  I'd stuff my face with Hummus, skip the Salatim altogether, order the Mezze and Al Ha'esh items very judiciously and share a single dessert.ps Hubby was bummed not to see a housemade hot sauce, inspired by, say Zhoug or Harissa, on the table.

I didn't LOVE the food like everyone else does. I liked it, it was good, but I'll never crave it. I'm happy to have checked this place off my to-eat list. Don't get me wrong, the dining experience, service, and music (Nelly's Ride with Me and Whitney Houston's Your Love is my Love) were all 5 star. We were brought several complimentary dishes which made us feel special.Dining Partner and I got our reservation two months in advance. We both did the tasting menu. It's a great value for $48 per person. Dining Partner also sprung for the wine pairing. The vegetable salads and hummus were incredible. But after that, I really had to make a conscious effort to keep consuming. I got lost at the mezze. I liked the cauliflower, but wasn't feeling the sable or the rhubarb. The entrees of brisket weren't what we were expecting. The desserts were great. The custard was complimentary, the chocolate olive oil cake was rich and delicious and Dining Partner loved the Squash konafi.Even though I didn't love the food, I left two hours later stuffed to the gills. It's a dining experience that's unparalleled."}, {"review_id": "guV_QZnbnpjsMq-wAJ0rOQ", "user_id": "g7F-U0dk9G4IG65-ExIzYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "One of the best place in town for Israel foodLove it!  I go there almost every weekLove everyone there !  Sometime it  feels like I'm going home"}, {"review_id": "EVx_LBuvazMbTVGwSctKPw", "user_id": "ufco-sxD9Org0AMxagNgQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "Probably the best Israeli dinner I've ever had, to this point. We both did the \"mini-tasting\" menu, which was an enormous amount of food for a very reasonable price. All in, here's what we ate (in rough order of how much we liked them):- Hummus with daily topping (fried chickpeas)- Salatim- Branzino----- Haloumi- Veal with sunchokes (complimentary)- Latkes- Brussels sprouts- Fried cauliflower- Pistachio upside-down cake----- Eggplant- Pumplin konafiStarting with the obvious -- I'm not a hummus expert, but this hummus was probably the best I've ever had. The salatim dishes were also incredible, especially the eggplant (some of the best eggplant I've ever eaten) and the beets.The mezzes and al-ha'esh dishes were surprising, in some ways -- I expected to love the eggplant (especially after the salatim) but we weren't crazy about it, whereas we weren't that pumped for the branzino, and it was amazing. (The crispy skin on it was just perfect.) We're also not usually big haloumi fans, and we absolutely loved it here.Also, as mentioned above, this was a LOT of food -- we were hurting at the end. That said, I think I would do it this way again, because the tasting menu is so cost-efficient relative to doing it a la carte.All in, an amazing meal for a really good price (especially compared to our normal NYC standards). Also, I'd highly recommend making a reservation (good luck) or going very early -- we went at 5:30 on a Thursday and waited about half an hour for bar seats."}, {"review_id": "aFFVHWBdel7AEXpkEwhC-Q", "user_id": "J_NZejScaR5_D6LerjASew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "I'm just going to keep this short. In summary, it was somewhere between a 3 and 4 stars, but the impeccable service and amazing atmosphere helped push my rating up. Don't get me wrong, the food was great. Everything was just a tad TOO flavorful and salty. I chugged 5 glasses of water at dinner to keep up with all the dishes.My suggestion is to tone down the flavors. But then again...what do I know? The people have spoken, and they love Zahav. It is definitely worth trying out, since it is one of the highest rated places in Philly.Pro tip: if you can't get a reservation, try for a seat at the bar!"}, {"review_id": "KiweWJRhiSHk2kioJ2_Cvg", "user_id": "c52vdp1FpkOVhn6iimGcgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Still our favorite restaurant in Philly! We even caught a Chef Solomonov sighting while sitting at the counter. This time, we got the lamb shoulder special, which came with Persian wedding rice as the main entree to share. Fall apart tender with fatty skin, and really savory rice with the right amount of crispy edges.The caramelized fennel was the only thing that was a bit too oily this time around. Next time, going back to duck hearts and fried cauliflower!Wine pairings were interesting but will probably opt for going by the glass next time.Wait time: got there at 4:40pm on a Saturday and made it for seats for 2 at the counter. Last seats were taken probably around 4:55 or 5."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/zahav-philadelphia?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
