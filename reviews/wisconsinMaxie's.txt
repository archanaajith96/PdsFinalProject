The drinks and food are reasonably priced and the charm of the south is brought to life by the building you dine in.I've had the ribs, red beans and rice, gumbo, catfish, jambalaya, crawfish, oysters and many different cocktails and beer. You CANNOT make a mistake on this menu. The cornbread has a hint of lemon and is not too heavy to bog down the rest of your meal. I've dined as a table of two and as many as a table of 8; the staff are always accommodating. Wait times can be long so call ahead for seating approximately 30-40 min. Although the wait times are long, the hostess and staff are realistic and underpromise. Parking is limited but a small lot is to the East of the building for one or two spots and handicapped individuals along with street parking an a lot to the west with about 20 spots. Enjoy a taste of the south in MKE."}, {"review_id": "VHDD0HpJj6YaAgXGKbOnKA", "user_id": "94IKjzbvzGAqqKOCNvuJjg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "So before people start going off the rails and sending me angry messages, I understand that we went on a Saturday night when it's probably it's busiest. We used the Nowait App as suggested on their website. We also understand that these times are estimates.We had a party of 4 and got in line around 6pm via the app.  The suggested time to be there by was 7:06 and we arrived around that time and checked in. We were told we had a few parties in front of us and as expected we had a wait. That wait ended up being 45 minutes but again, we get how busy the place was. We were able to get a few seats at the bar and have a drink and chat while we waited. (Side note: It was about 10-15 minutes after I was texted that our table was ready that we were seated.)We were greeted in a timely fashion by a smiley and friendly waitress. Drink and appetizer orders were put in and a about 10 minutes after that we were ordering dinner.  Another few minutes and our drinks made to the table and shortly after we had our appetizers. Everything was going well but then we waited... and waited... and watched people seated right before us leaving and we hadn't gotten our dinner and our waitress never stopped back.  We were really starting to wonder about our food when it finally arrived.  The guests at the table next to us asked about my dinner right as it arrived as they were ordering their dinner. (This is relevant because 10 minutes after that conversation they had their food, we waited almost an hour).I ordered the ribs with no sauce and it was tasty. Definitely a ton of Cajun seasoning but I do enjoy my food a touch spicy. I also ordered a side of the greens to go with it and it was really good.  When I asked around the table the rest of my group weren't as thrilled with their meals. They found it be OK. My wife ordered shrimp and grits and noted that the shrimp was really fishy, the grits were seasoned well but the tomato/pepper sauce they had on top tasted like it just came out of a can.  For the prestige and price we paid for our meals, this all came as a huge disappointment.Would we go back? The short answer is no.  The overall experience did not live up to expectations. The food quality wasn't worth the overall wait and price we paid. So many amazing restaurants out there to experience.Should you go? Of course you need to try this for yourself. Go with no expectations and maybe not on a Saturday night. Hopefully your experience was not like ours. On the next place... where should we go?"}, {"review_id": "Bp1OjDM-_NDnncpHA1Msfg", "user_id": "ZuVIbvRKwpL0d2DIHVAs3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Been to Maxie's twice now and now time to write the joint a proper review. Both times, I've had excellent service and meals, so this joint is now on my list of go to solid spots to get the goods. It can get a bit hectic as Maxie's get's busy but with the Yelp check in feature you won't have to spend too much dilly dallying around. First trip we sat upstairs at the bar, as we love to do at so many establishments. Made it just in time for the tail end of Happy Hour so I ordered some oysters and had a couple solid cocktails. The start of the night though was by far the Abita beer braised duroc pork cheeks with white cheddar grits. This dish was about as solid as you could ever ask for. The pork was fall off the bone tender and the flavors were all that and then some. Those grits held up well with the dish and it was just a treat to the taste buds. With that I knew we'd be back to try more. Second trip we went a little more pedestrian and I tried the catfish Po' Boy. Damn! The fillet of catfish they threw on this nicely sliced hunk of French bread was all that. It came perfectly dusted in a nice light cornmeal batter. I was impressed especially since I love Po' Boys. Also ordered the corn crab chowder soup, which was freaking outstanding! I could've ate two bowls of it. We also drank a couple cocktails and the standout for this jaunt was the jalapeno margarita. It was a small margarita but packed big flavor. Overall Maxie's is exactly where they should be. They impressed me big time for both visits we've been there. We brought friends the second time and they too enjoyed everything on their plates. I'll be back again for some Milwaukee style Southern delight."}, {"review_id": "fTwyddTvhJrVgfNur6tm2Q", "user_id": "4qYuZmlndclYBVy7o_xokg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "DELICIOUS - DELICIOUS I was so happy that i stopped by here after work especially on a day that they were doing a Mardi-Gras special with their menu.

Chicken fried chicken is my favorite dish with shrimp and grits a close second.Happy hour is also killer with 1 dollar oysters. After 6 the price goesup to 3 so get there early.

I must say, I am SO GLAD I did. There is a second floor to Maxie's which has a cozy atmosphere (first floor is open with high ceilings, second floor is standard height with fun lighting and decor). Service was night and day. First visit our service was adequate. Second visit was so much better. Our server was very friendly and a good amount of attentive. The first time around we ordered the Frogmore Stew and the Catfish Po'boy and found them both to be a big let down. I was informed later that there is both a crawfish and oyster option for the po'boy upon request.  Now we're talking I returned to try my favorite Cajun entree and was NOT disappointed. The crawfish had great seasoning and was deep fried to a nice golden brown. I don't think I set my sandwich down more than twice.

Maxie's!  It turns out that their Friday menu of daily specials includes a fabulous fish fry.  Thanks to the help of Yelp's \"Waitlist\" feature, we were able to get our names on the list and take a leisurely trip to Maxie's.  We were seated 5 minutes after arriving and our dashed hopes for Friday Fish Fry were resurrected!  Maxie's is already one of our favorite places for romantic dinners and this fish fry was in line with their other excellent food.  We ordered their novel crab-infused hush puppies as a starter.. Delicious.  The fish fry consisted of 4 battered planks of Pacific Cod, French fries, and cole slaw.  Maybe good fortune colored my perspective but this is some of the best fish I have had around here! Cooked to perfection and tasty.  Good tartar sauce to dip it in and Great fries!  Oh, the slaw was excellent too.  The bonus feature about this fish fry is that it's Green!  Most fish frys serve Cod, Perch, and/or Walleye.  The cod usually served is Atlantic cod with is significantly over-fished, to the extent that it is listed as \"vulnerable\" to extinction.  Even though I love cod, it gives me pause before ordering it at most other fish fries.  Not at Maxie's!  The Pacific Cod they serve is a sustainably managed fishery and so folks that worry about this sort of thing can eat guilt free! Maxie's may have just displaced the other \"classic\" fish fry joints for our family."}, {"review_id": "ee7Iwp5b-1q-JOiSLrZmcg", "user_id": "vwjtyQP1t5gzl4rNKwi0bw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "I had high hopes for this place based on the reviews here and elsewhere, but I left feeling thoroughly disappointed. It feels like the sort of place where people primarily go to drink and hang out with friends, so the food isn't the focus and quality suffers as a result.Everything I tried was decidedly mediocre:- The courtesy cornbread had potential because it was super moist, but it didn't hold up well--it was really crumbly and ended up falling apart.- The BBQ beef brisket was mushy and lacked any distinct smoky flavor (or any other flavor for that matter), simply drowned in bbq sauce.- The mac and cheese was fine, though it seemed reheated. Pretty hard to screw up mac and cheese.- The maple-braised collard greens were bland and uninspiring.Service was mostly fine, until the end when things took a weird turn. Before I had even finished my entree, the server asked about dessert and brought my bill. Then he just disappeared, never came back to pickup the check or top up my water, etc. Luckily I had exact change on me to pay the bill + tip so I could just leave without having to flag him down, but it was just odd and left a bad impression."}, {"review_id": "VVR3b6IRQfYH9weJNpyJRw", "user_id": "Co3BXjjwjxK3aAM1gaH-qg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "We have enjoyed eating at Maxie's in the past and looked forward to going again.

It was a last minute decision on a Tuesday night, which we did not regret. It was packed though! They run some good weekly specials. We came on a wing night! Our wait was about 10 minutes, which wasn't bad. The hostess and waiter were very friendly. It was very loud in there, so the acoustics weren't the best, but it wasn't unbearable. We just had to talk a bit louder than we were used to. Corn bread comes out while you wait and it was very yummy and complimentary. We ordered drinks and apps first. I got the Louisiana classic: the Hurricane and it was phenomenal! We ordered wings and fried green tomatoes as the apps. Both were okay. They definitely weren't the best apps I've ever had. And they don't carry ANY ranch dressing, which was rather shocking actually. I ordered The Shrimp and Grits. It came with a sauce that I should have asked for less of. I just didn't realize they put so much on. I even could have done without the sauce at all. It honestly took away from the dish itself. The Shrimp were delicious and the grits were cooked perfectly. Is actually Order it again only this time I know to ask for no sauce or for the sauce to be on the side. My fiancé got the catfish meal. Meh. I didn't like it. It was too fishy for me. My fiancé said it was under-seasoned and that she wouldn't order it again. Our friend Maria got the chicken meal. It was a fried breast that came with mashed potatoes and a veg. I absolutely LOVED the mashed potatoes and the collard greens. They were both to die for. So delicious. Chicken was okay; was a bit dry. In conclusion we had a lot of leftovers to say the least. The whole experience was good, but it's all in the company you keep, right?! I am sure we will be back in the future.

My two stars are for service and for drinks. I really actually like their drink menu, and HH gives you a buck off all of them. On Mondays they have $5 mojitos which is awesome too. The bartenders are skilled and the beer options are great. The fallout comes with the food. First off, the prices are INSANE. I was seeing $25 for a mediocre plate of overcooked meat, $14 for a bowl of burnt gumbo and $17 for \"small plate specials.\" If this food was fantastic I'd complain less, but I ALWAYS leave wondering how and why I spent so much money on food I didn't like. The \"broth\" of the gumbo literally tastes dirty. The sauce on their fatty ribs tastes like it came out of a jar. Their slaw is slimy and thick, the fried tomatoes are covered in a tasteless batter, I seriously just-dont-get-it. I'm really glad that so many other people like this place, it just isn't for me--find me at Story Hill."}, {"review_id": "hons8k__yYrl0h_k_WZwmw", "user_id": "Ij3V7rcvSRi6ilBE9F4itg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I really love this place, the atmosphere, drinks, and food are always great.
