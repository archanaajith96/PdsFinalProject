Good vibe. Bright open dining room. Walk-up to the cabinet and order. Coffee and water (all beverages actually) are self-serve. No waiter service. Menu is limited. Very very few options - disappointed at first but realized quickly they do what they do VERY WELL!They do bring your food to the table. I had the B&G with two eggs, cooked perfectly. Flavor was awesome with a bit of a kick to the sausage gravy...delish! Bf had the breakfast sandwich which was equally as good - bacon was yum yum!Staff was friendly. Prices are on the high end of fair. Coffee was decent. Food fantastic. Convenient parking. Fun vibe - try it!"}, {"review_id": "GydGagcA3ISlCuCD6Fkypg", "user_id": "tJTkeZNMk2hD7y4rA21xfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "I'm pretty upset this morning.

I always do this little happy dance when I eat great food, and was def dancing all the way through this meal. Quaint little place in an unexpected location north of downtown KC. I thought to myself afterwards, why the heck did I wait to so long to make my way down here?! Coffee and water were self serve, always a plus since you can get unlimited refills when you want.  They serve Broadway Roasting Co coffee, another local KC place. Yum. Ordered the farmers tart, seasonal veggies, in January they were beets and figs (maybe) on top of a layer of goat cheese and delicious crust. Arugula salad and two sunnies. I wish I could have had at least another full plate of this. I also tasted the breakfast sandwich sans bacon and aoli and add arugula. I don't think there is anything on the menu that wouldn't be worth trying. Service was great, everyone was very friendly. Vibe was really chill. If you are waiting to try this place, don't! Go now!"}, {"review_id": "QyICUZaI7H96Jz7ZTcmlQw", "user_id": "l4n41Xxvk9sGjpR4vYx2Pg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "While exploring the amazing food scene in Kansas City we came across Happy Gillis Cafe in our search for the perfect breakfast.

It's a very casual kitchy place that offers all day breakfast and soup, salad and sandwiches for lunch. The staff is very friendly and says hello and thank you for coming. We mentioned it was our first time and they gave us their recommendations. I went with the veggie tart that came with two sunny side up eggs and a handful of dressed arugala with a simple vinegrette ($10). The eggs were perfectly done with a runny yolk and set whites. The tart was not exactly what I expected but delicious. As a veggie tart I expected more vegetables but it had a wonderfully flakey base, goat cheese and three pieces of roasted eggplant. Friendly, yummy and a good value."}, {"review_id": "Ws33YKPVcMi8PAnqUJAPmQ", "user_id": "w1cmvoq_dxLHniih6eTJKA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "This was a fun experience and great food. The prices were not comparable to your run of the mill Waffle House, but you're really not @Happy Gillis to worry about price right? The yogurt and mixed grains and honey was very good, coffee was hot! We got lucky in seating , but it is a hot commodity here. The decor was kitschy, with a side of grandma's house vibes.

It was a beautiful Saturday morning and my boyfriend and I were in search for a breakfast place we haven't tried before. He brought up that we had always wanted to try Happy Gillis since it is located next door to one of the best ramen shops around. So.. we went! Except.. when we got there we stood in line for a long time, were sort of forced to stare or be stared at by the 4 whole tables that made up the restaurant floor.. which would be acceptable if the prices of the limited menu made up for the wait as well as the lack of seating. Their menu was expensive for what it was, it was almost making up in profit for what they would have made with table service if they had it. Nice try, guys..  but if my breakfast sandwich is going to cost me 9$, at least have two registers and more tables and bigger portions. We made it half way down the line, people who had been standing there longer than we had since before we arrived were finally getting food and being forced to ask for it to go since there was no where to sit. We didn't make it to a register to place an order, we left and went to Succotash where food is worth the wait.I gave them two stars because I didn't have a chance to try the food but also am not sure I want to come back either. If for any reason I come back, I will update the review."}, {"review_id": "TDY6T2489SlGG6AAeQaOpQ", "user_id": "pSUp9rQHnNHzzYHMMd_mVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2017", "text": "Boyfriend and I loved the brunch at Happy Gillis. Out of all the places we visited in KC, this meal was by far our favorite from the trip! The plating, the flavor combination, and varying texture were all on point! We ordered three plates and loved all three. We couldn't decide which was our most favorite. 3 Brunch Plate Recommendations1. Shrimp & Grits tasted beautifully as it looked. It had a nice kick to it and loved that the grits didn't have a mushy texture like many grits. 2. Smoked Salmon on avocado toast had a nice kick to it. I love the soft egg and spicy cornuts/sunflower seed mixture. 3. Also the half order of Biscuit & Gravy was pretty good as well. I'm not a huge biscuit and gravy person, but it went well with the two plates we ordered. Cons:1. Very small space. I do not recommend bringing a group.2. Not a great place to take your time when it's busy. You eat and leave so that the next standing group can sit at your table because the space is limited. 3. The lack of space has a weird flow but it seems to work.Regardless of the cons, the food blew our minds and we would totally come back!"}, {"review_id": "yaJpsOJXEEluenAIcqa1jw", "user_id": "i56BPi1ZmOR_axQS_UTm2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "I stopped into this cute restaurant for breakfast.  I ordered the smoked salmon.  When it came I was amazed by how beautiful the restaurant had managed to make a simple dish of smoked salmon on toast look.  The toast was hearty and filling and the cream cheese with fennel that was spread on it was quite tasty.  The poached egg on top made it a truly wonderful breakfast.  I also tried some of my sisters veggie tart which was very yummy.  If I lived in the area I would be a regular here!"}, {"review_id": "gJ_p6T_S0SGXHFgWSb2sPw", "user_id": "P5f6o2xX51KC5fgBu4qSrw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Today's visit was unsatisfactory. Based on postmates reviews and the demand....we figured this was the place to try. We were poorly mistaken.  Their biscuits and gravy...un impressive. The biscuits were still hard after being warmed up in a panini press and their gravy was so thin, I could see the top of my biscuit through the poured gravy. Hearing other customers rave about this plate, they clearly have no idea of good biscuits and gravy. The cooks brunch, so much for so little. An orange slice for show, a horrible English muffin and sausage with a sunny side egg. Needless to say I should have gotten more for my money."}, {"review_id": "rW0QMGKjTmxBM0MpX8ZdSw", "user_id": "Sp0oKHSUCkuwlM3sKKhjrg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/26/2017", "text": "Pros: Cute restaurant. This area of town has a lot of character.  The quality of food was good. The Biscuits and gravy were very good but spicey. The cookies were also good. The sandwiches looked great.Cons:The menu is a little too trendy for me. The menu is difficult to read or see. The only menu is what's on the blackboard behind the counter.There are no paper menus, just the blackboard.I wish they had some basics like a plain old omelet with bacon. Fountain drinks would be good.Service is slow even when not busy.

Menu that a lot going on considering there's only about 5 breakfast and 5 lunch options. They are open early until 3 and even offer alcohol. It's located in a little neighborhood and it's very small so there could be a wait, but the food is well worth it. I'm not sure if the menu rotates but it gives the vibe of a place that is constantly reinventing heir offerings based on the season. I had the avocado toast with salmon and sunflower seeds and eggs. One of the best brunch dishes I have ever had. There was so much going on and it had a nice spicy level in the sunflower seeds that offered me the option to not even add hot sauce, which is very atypical for me. The meal (with the addition of a second egg) cost $13. The person I was with had a breakfast sandwich that was a typical egg sandwich but on a perfectly cooked toast. That came in at $8. I highly recommend the salmon plate I ordered, not just a brunch meal but anytime you plan on visiting.  What a great find in Kansas City. Highly recommended."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/happy-gillis-cafe-and-hangout-kansas-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
