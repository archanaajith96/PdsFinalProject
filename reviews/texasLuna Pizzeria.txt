It is so fresh, and flavorful. They have a great variety of toppings, and bring you freshly grated Parmesan cheese and spices with the pizza. Their lemonade is wonderful too.

The portion of the personal pan was perfect for lunch. Riddled with Cajun Andouille, jalapeño, and an assortment of onions, this work of art was a grand slam. The ambience was well suited for the food. Great for kiddos as well. Also credits to Thomas and Hugo at the register. Their patience and genuine intrigue helped me navigate the Various choices."}, {"review_id": "x1ZxbmxHmkk_ReLXH_cQRA", "user_id": "dhSRVRbF7ZyBfuCnQ4yTrA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "This is an update to my previous review.

My favorites are the pepperoni pizza and mushroom pizza. The \"pepperoni\" has a lot of flavor with a generous amount of cheese and the \"mushroom\" has a special ingredient- whipped ricotta- which makes it so unique. I've tried out other places that have lighter and healthier tasting pizza, but I find Luna's to be the most flavorful and satisfying. Can't forget to mention their signature freshly baked warm cookies, which are the best!"}, {"review_id": "7ZmKuuF0vvcIyKgMKEw1yQ", "user_id": "pou3BbKsIozfH50rxmnMew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Why 5 stars? Because I'll be thinking about this pizza for quite some time.   ---   ---   ---When I'm back in Houston to visit family, I generally find myself in the burbs - both on the north and south side. But when we're trying to meet in the middle somewhere, I capitalize on the opportunity to visit one of the restaurants I have bookmarked. I wish I could spend the majority of my time in Houston, inside the loop, but this city is so damn big that I have to pick my moments. I'm so glad one of those moments was Luna!Starting off, I was debating if I should order the roasted garlic tomato soup. It's not something I'd normally go for, but because it was cold outside, I figured I would give it a shot. That was an *excellent* decision, as that was some of the best soups I've ever had. I am not a huge tomato fan, but it didn't even taste like tomato - it was just like a buttery bisque. I can't imagine coming here in the future and not ordering it again!For my pizza, I decided to build my own: red peppers, prosciutto, andouille and ricotta. I have to say, this was quite an amazing concoction, and as much as I'd like to credit my custom pizza building skills, I think the credit has to go to the folks in the kitchen. I absolutely loved this pizza. Absolutely. Loved.As we were sitting in typical, awful I-45 traffic en route here, I was nervous that Luna might end up not being worth it, but those worries were all for naught. The 4.5 star rating with hundreds of reviews is well-deserved!"}, {"review_id": "7q-dQPq2g1Y9AaEy62jSBw", "user_id": "xXfWLjfTFZ3v6q5nrFdsTw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "We had a basic pepperoni pizza that was great.  I liked the crust and the ingredients tasted really fresh.  The location is casual but has a hip vibe.  The price was reasonable and there was ample parking.  It is a good stop for pizza."}, {"review_id": "meqpso_Cy2bLh9XMh7or_w", "user_id": "oA3_30pC-JPQ8PFbFE1MKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This is by far the best pizza place H-Town has to offer.

Same owners as Barnabys, it has to be right? They have cool games to keep you or your kids occupied while your eating there or picking up to go. The block men are my personal favorite. My favorite pizza is to get the pepperoni, spicy sausage and whipped ricotta. I will add the whipped ricotta to any of their pizzas.

About the pizza: Don't even know how to start describing it but by just saying is so FREAKING good! All the ingredients taste fresh and the pizza has a unique flavor. The pizza also came with a side of Parmesan cheese, pepper flakes, and basil. About the salads: I had the Caesar salad we ordered a small one and it was enough for two people. It had just the right amount of dressing and cheese. Only one small complain would be if they could add extra croutons.About the customer service: My boyfriend and I had no clue on what to order, the cashier was so nice and helped us out. He suggested the Spicy Andouille pizza (& boy was it GOOD) also, we decided to do half Mushrooms we also enjoyed it. Also, the wait is not long at all. Overall, everyone we encountered was nice.

This is located in the same plaza as pappa(sitos??), fat bao, and sushi king going down kirby. parking can be limited though...noteable things about this place: BYOPizza, or choose from (cheaper) pre-set options. i picked the half and half mushroom and andouille pizza as documented by many yelpers before me, and it was good! I wouldn't say AMAZING, but you can tell just how fresh the cheese is. They also supply everything from olive oil, garlic flakes, red pepper, FRESH basil, and giant parmesan chunks. They've also got a pretty decent caesar salad (some pictures made me crave a salad which has never happened in my life before) and it was good! Wish the dressing was a little creamier,  but the romaine lettuce was cut at the crunchiest and most satisfying portions and a mini portion is almost more than enough for a single person (maybe share with someone else? a small i would say its enough for a salad starter for 3 people). They've got games at the table while you wait too, and the table set up is reminiscent of a fancy dine-in restaurant, but the place is as casual as you want it to be. perfect for a lazy pizza night or a fun first date place. staff is super friendly and happy to give suggestions. i may not be back on my own choice because other BYOPizza places i've been to (your pie, blazed) are slightly more flavorful, but the toppings here are guaranteed fresh and definitely worth giving a try."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/luna-pizzeria-houston?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
