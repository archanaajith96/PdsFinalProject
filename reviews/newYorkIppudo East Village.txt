I arrived alone and waited about 2 minutes for them to give me a seat, didn't actually have time to wait drinking a beer at the bar. Coming in, as the asian-looking woman asks me to follow her and we walk through a narrow dark hallway into the dining area, she stops at the end of the hallway, where I could see the others diners and she proceeded to yell a long phrase in Japanese that I didn't understand, but sure hope she meant well for me... The rest of the staff replied with what I surmised was a sign of agreement. Add this to a decor of black walls, bamboo ornaments, white and red flags and kanji's writing all over... It just makes the experience whole!The menu is not extensive and that's acceptable for a first timer. Since the lady seating in the same table in front of me (Which I didn't know but we ended up sharing the table with 4 other couples) was eating some sort of buns, I asked for the Ippudo Buns with vegetables ($9 USD for 2 buns). The dough is delicious and the fried vegetables patty inside is so tasty that you can't taste what vegetables they used or if they mistakenly gave you pork. Since I'm a recovering carnivore-holic, tasting these 2 slices of pork made the best of the soup for me!To add to the experience, an imported Asahi dry beer ($8) had to be had.For the main course I asked for advice since noodles are not my favorite food... This is because they are (in my opinion) a bunch of pasta with lots of flavored water... At least that's what I've had until today. I ate in Japan noodles deemed to be the best in Japan by some people from the country and left completely unsurprised. When asked to the lady for the most ordered noodles she pointed to the Akamaru Modern ($15) but when she asked me if I could eat spicy (My Mexican mustache must have given me) and I nodded, she recommended the Karaka-Men ($16). She offered to add an egg for $2 USD. Since the egg (according to her) didn't alter the flavor much, I decided to go with it and it was a great decision!Today, I don't know nor care if the noodles served here represent the Japanese culture... What I know is that this is the first time in my life that I have enjoyed noodles with gusto!Watch a video to learn how to eat noodles before you go: youtu.be/9MrL90zksKc"}, {"review_id": "ifOsYEUy-6L3yNCqnoOe0A", "user_id": "Se1LDLfZ8_Or_U2MSPTrSA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Ippudo ramen definitely deserves a 5 stars rate but the reason why I gave it one star because I hope the owner will actually look into having a better manager with better customer service. There's an Asian girl who takes down ppl name and number of ppl. I came here twice during my trip and both times I was greeted by her... the first time already just killed our mood because of her disgusting attitude.Second time we came back since our other friends wanted to try as well and it was her again. We had a party of 7 and when we told her she just said ok.  Nobody was behind us.. so I then asked how long will the wait be and she just gave me attitude and said you can't be seated until all parties are there... okay I understood that policy but when I told you 7 .. why didn't you say so?? My bf was in the restroom so I told her he's here .. she said no they need to be all present?? Are you serious?? This girl does not have a smile on her face to even be placed in front to greet ppl. Anyway, we just told her 6 ppl then Bc our other friend had to take the subway which we'll never know how long .. so we told her okay 6 .. she start warning us well if he does show up I can't have him seated with you guys... We came here right when the restaurant open so it's not like there's anyone waiting after us.. we got seated and then our friend arrive like 5 mins after.. he came in not knowing anything and just said his friends table is inside .. she ignored him..rolled her eyes at him!! And told our waiter he cannot join us... what is wrong with this girl?? We wanted to talk to a manager and guess what ? She's the manager?? To the rude girl I've dealt with.. if you really hate your job that much .. better off quitting Bc you're ruining a tourist experiencing something that was suppose to be great. Don't ruin someone's business bc of your horrible customer service.Food was great .. but when you have these type of service .. you can't even enjoy your food.. just ruined our brunch.. I totally forgot to ask for her name but I'm sure you know who I'm talking about \"ippudo\"."}, {"review_id": "QzdwxETIE7EpvAulWhPfEg", "user_id": "Dl8UzehqTZNMfuGksnvoRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Now this is ramen.

I don't remember the name of the ramen I got but the broth was amazing. Perfect flavor and thickness.

I wouldn't order these again.Her ramen was very good.  The broth was nice and creamy and had lots of depth of flavor.  The portion size of the soup warranted an extra order of noodles.  It was worth it to soak up all the extra  flavor in the soup.My sukiyaki portion was actually pretty small in comparison.  It wasn't a traditional sukiyaki, in that it lacked ingredients like shirataki noodles and was not served with rice.  However, the intense flavor made up for that.  It had a nice sweet flavor, and really satisfied!I dont know if I would wait in line to go again, but it was fun to try!"}, {"review_id": "93rsVQp4GXX5jb1w3sPxVQ", "user_id": "Jwl01bIIoX9sVTP0dHSzwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I've heard many good things about Ippudo but I have really bad luck and whenever I'm in town there's a really long wait or I can't make it for some reason. Needless to say today I finally made it to Ippudo - the infamous ramen place in NYC. MI was very impressed with the customer service. We didn't have to wait to get a table and the waiters/ waitresses were suuuper attentive and fast. I actually didn't like what I ordered and asked to order something else. I felt super bad because I never do that but they were really understanding and didn't mind (I hope )!!! I really wanted a white Milky broth today but I got a more thinner consistency- which is NOT a bad thing. I just was craving something milky and with a heavier broth consistency today. The noodles --- I have never had noodles like this because my theory is that A) they make them from scratch. Pleas keep up the good work because the noodles are partly the reason why I love this place Broth - omg So So So good. Not too heavy or oily unlike some ramen places. I think it's hard to keep it non greasy especially when you're cooking with pork but Ippudo does a great job at making   it just  right"}, {"review_id": "-690LVeSCmZD0AcejhGj_Q", "user_id": "FiqUR5o5ty_OLPYSb31Dkw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "We were really excited to try this ramen chain in the US but it was unfortunately not even close to its flagship stores in Japan.

I'm not sure if I can say the same for my recent visit. As of 1/31/18 they NO LONGER TAKE PHONE NUMBERS down and text you when the table is ready. On Friday 7pm, they quote my party 45 mins and told us to come back. We came back and got quoted another 45 mins. That's when I realized we shouldn't have left. This new system made everyone crowd the entrance area to the point where I felt like I was in a mta subway during rush hour. Sadly, the food was not the same as I remembered. We ordered wings which tasted basic and soggy. They were really small. It was $3 per piece which is extremely overpriced. I'd say skip. The ramen came quick and hot. The noodles were perfectly cooked. I had the akamaru modern. The broth was not as flavorful and the pork was not as tender as it used to be. I hate to give it 3 stars.

The Ramen is cooked to perfection and love their Ippudo buns! I definitely recommend going to Ippudo, especially if this is your first time trying Ramen, you are in for a treat....I have been going for years, but finally wrote a review, and will be back again! Now why didn't I give them 5 Stars?? You ask? These reasons: 1. They don't take your number down anymore, so instead of walking outside and getting fresh air so people don't heavily breathe on you or going to another bar and hanging out there while the wait is 1 hour, they tell you to stay close by and if you do leave, to make sure that you come back 20 minutes before your quoted time. This is super annoying because if by some miracle your table is ready 20 minutes before the quoted time and you are not near by, you will lose it. I would totally understand this concept if they had a huge bar and waiting area, but being jam packed and have people coughing and sneezing next to you, you are forced to stand in a small space or else you just waited for no reason. I hope they get the phone system again, because its ridiculous to be in a germ box. 2. I couldn't figure out who my server was, I was ordering beer from the busboy who was super attentive and I made sure to give him a cash tip for his hard work, but it wasn't until I was ready to pay the server who first took my order came by. This bugs me because I am sure he will get a higher tip than the busboy (who smiled and was super friendly, and just made the visit nice). I get if the server is busy but he literally took my order, and dropped the check. I would have ordered more if he came by more. I will say the busboy and the food runners were awesome! They did everything with a smile and were very polite. 3. The ToGo thing- is really annoying. I get it, a true Japanese Ramen place doesn't do it, but know your audience, you are in NYC and we live on nice plastic togo boxes to take our meal home if we can't shovel it all down in one sitting"}, {"review_id": "EL0UdjgFO5gEYYA0qkFLRQ", "user_id": "Z2g96jwxyqLdOBUq0qRaCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "I will never get tired of coming here.

The hype is real! If there is one thing you need to try, it's definitely the amazingness that is their ramen.My friend and I had the opportunity to visit Ippudo's spot in the East Village on a chilly Tuesday night. The restaurant doesn't take reservations, so we were rolling the dice on our chances of not having to wait an eternity to be seated (which I hear is pretty common for this specific spot). However, we got lucky! We came in around 6:10 PM and only had to wait about 3 minutes until a table was available. I can't say the same about all the others we saw waiting when we left. The lobby was PACKED with people waiting for open tables. Good thing we got there on the earlier side.The restaurant itself is surprisingly large, given the fact that it's lobby is so small. When we entered the main dining area we were collectively greeted by the entire staff! Once we were seated we were given our menu's and time to look over the menu.When it finally came time to order, I ended up going with the Karaka-Men ($16) while my friend chose the Shiromaru New York ($17). Since the Karaka-Men was advertised as a \"spicy\" dish I was excited to have something that would've warmed me up. BE WARNED, even though the dish is delicious, it's not as spicy as I had hoped it be :( Probably a 4/10 on the \"spicy\" richter scale.The service was alright as well! Our server sat us and told us if we had any questions to feel free to ask. She didn't hover and also gave us ample time throughout the meal to enjoy our food. Overall this is a great place to go if you're in the St. Marks - NYU area and are looking for some filling ramen. All I'd say is get there early!
