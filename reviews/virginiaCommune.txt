All the ingredients are locally-sourced, farm-fresh items. The back of the menu names the locations from which each of their dairy products, vegetables, and meats come from. All of their herbs are grown in the back. We started with coffee. The dulce de leche coffee was exceptionally good. All the coffees were fair-trade and sourced from Haiti which was the only non-locally grown item. If you're looking for a sweetener, consider trying the honey instead of sugar (it's also local and fresh). There were so many good-sounding options on the menu that it was really tough to decide what to order! When one of us couldn't decide what cheese to get on our sandwiches, the chef let us sample pimento cheese, even though we eventually decided against it. As someone who owns chickens, I'm a huge egg snob. Their eggs are fresh as could be and they were cooked over-easy to perfection. The sweet potato barley salad and goat cheese worked really well with the egg. I went with the small plate rather than the entrée plate, which hit the spot because I wasn't particularly hungry that did the job. All of the greens were extremely crisp. The sweet potato tots were way better than we expected. They are large and flavorful with a creamy inside and a crisp outer shell. They were also drizzled with honey, which nicely complimented the salty tots.Though we didn't order crepes, the portions looked pretty favorable. The space was not overly-crowded, though it was a chilly April Friday. There were people inside doing work on their laptops and there were other people there for sit down breakfasts with groups. The large communal table in the middle holds a lot of people and the tables on the outside are great for parties of 2-4. Though we didn't order any, there're a wide variety of pastries when you're walking out the door."}, {"review_id": "uQ3XlfbN8-VLaY-nranbog", "user_id": "Ofjmtygn_MuO6kn5ahuZYw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I've heard of amaaaaazing things about this place from friends and family. Maybe it wasn't the best day to go? Two cons: disorganized hostess and weird meal. Upon my arrival with a fellow pregnant friend, the hostess told us it was a 5 minute wait and she had to wipe down some tables.. and if we were okay with outside potentially, but only if the people waiting ahead of us weren't wanting outside. Meanwhile, two people walk in after us and say they're going to sit at the bar. We didn't know that was an option. The hostess goes away, comes back 5 minutes later, talks to new people that walked in, and then still hasn't wiped down any tables. She clears off plates from a large group and we see people getting up at the bar so we decide to sit there instead. It was an awkward time with the hostess! 10 minutes had gone by and she just seemed confused or having a hard time keeping things under control.I got the gnocchi summer bowl and it was just okay. It left something to be desired. The gnocchi was fried and they tasted bland and dry, no flavor really. The sauce was good, but I always think pasta should be tossed in sauce rather than laying on top of it. I tried my friends grit bowl and it was yummmmmy."}, {"review_id": "1c58YnBCW3kMgwNG8UrKhA", "user_id": "4EjePjAsoWHvvBB_17CWvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update: 3/24/18 - came back and still a great place!  Had the cornmeal waffles again.

The rest of the seating is an \"L\" style bar up against the windows looking out at the street.The food is amazing, hands down.  90% of the ingredients for all their dishes come from locally sourced farms.  My kids ate split the ham and cheese sandwich that was delicious!  Ham, melted pimento cheese (kinda Spivey for young kids), and thinly sliced apples on handmade bread.  I had a killer burger with Pimento cheese and a garlic style aioli.  Their spread for breakfast/ brunch is pretty legit, and ranges from extremely healthy to something one would only have once a month.Service was great, the waitresses were attentive without hovering around, and took extra care to provide additions for the kids without me having to ask (high chair, cups with lids, and an extra plate for the split entree).  Stellar place with even better vibes.-CHEERS!"}, {"review_id": "RLhWruvTh20jmsGat6--QA", "user_id": "cp4KK1WzziduX6yKedpcyQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Well this was a pleasant way to start the new year! I used my recently won gift card from their awesome holiday sweater contest that I believe only I entered & thoroughly enjoyed the staff, service, food, beverages, wall art, decor, & everything else I might have missed! My dad had never been to Commune & I had never been to the VB location. Wow, this location had an amazing vibe to go along with very helpful staff. The attractive young blonde gal that waited on us seemed to also be acting as the hostess so we primarily exchanged pleasantries with her, but another young lady came by with water & topped off our coffee upon request. My dad & I split the Apple Croissant, we each had about 2.5 cups of coffee to go along with our meals. He had the classic breakfast sammie with bacon & a side of bacon that we also shared. The bacon was a nice addition to my \"The whole damn farm\" crepe which I had about half of it leftover for future enjoyment :DThe bathroom was clean & tucked far away in the back down a nicely decorated hallway with unique art fabric or canvas swatches lining the wall. The bathroom was pretty cold as we're all fighting this 20 degree weather right now.I thought it was a little bit odd that when we came in & saw 2 people sitting at a big table that the hostess had to go ask if they minded if we joined them. I mean, the place is called Commune after all & a shared table with strangers seemed implied. Oh well, they were cool with it & we chatted briefly with them. ''Twas all in all a great meal in a unique restaurant that uses locally sourced everything. I don't make it out that way all that often, but I'll try to make a return visit sooner than later :)"}, {"review_id": "Fc73ooK_zYSImyaTswnmxQ", "user_id": "dqiC3WBYt4VL6Op4pS3u6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "The food was delicious.

The place was packed and we had about a 45 minute wait. Once we were seated. We occupied another half of an table that had another party on the other end. They are very efficient. Similar to habachi style minus the food being cooked in front of you. I love the concept of the place, everything is local and made from scratch, however, it wasn't my cup of tea. It took some time for our waiter to take our order so we were ready when she eventually came. I ordered chicken and waffles with eggs and a coffee. A guy from the other end of the table suggested we taste a pumpkin roll so we obliged. The waffles were made from a seedy braid which I didnt like at at. It was like eating seeds. The syrup was really thin and sweet. The chicken was a thigh so I removed the skin and asked for ketchup. The ketchup was homemade and sweet but I didn't really like it. The pumpkin roll was delicious and we ordered more to go. The staff was pretty friendly.Very unique and different. Not for me but would recommend people try it."}, {"review_id": "L-FrFruQWCk-ofWk1cU1MA", "user_id": "JdQK8OzsQt7p3JwR218C8w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "Two visits in a span of about two years.

I LOVE that the products are local & they have their own garden. Very admirable & such an awesome concept. I get it. This 2nd visit, I tried a Beignet & an Apple Grilled Cheese. Pretty presentation for both.Someone next to me was raving about thebeignet, which is why I ordered. I don't have a baseline of what a beignet should taste like. After never having one, I was happy it was good, warm, & pretty. While it was good, my first thought was that I wanted a KK donut. The Apple Grilled Cheese - How can one mess up a grilled cheese. I figured this would be a safe bet. The ends of the bread were extremely hard. I was scared my teeth were going to fall out. I enjoyed the flavors. My daughter did not. The greens were an acquired taste. If someone has a dish that really stands out at Commune, please let me know. I really hope to enjoy this place one day.

Walking in, everything was very cute. They even had their own mini farm in the back where they grow a lot of their own herbs. My husband orders the hot chicken sandwich which made his day. The chicken was crunchy and juicy. It had this amazing mustard on it which really tied the dish togeher. The bun was soft but had a nice crunch to it.I had a cheese burger which was very good, but I don't feel like it was spectacular or anything to go back for. I also ordered the watermelon sangria, which was a bit of a disappointment. There was almost no alcohol in the sangria and the watermelon juice tasted off. You know that taste, off watermelon, not good. I was a little surprised that the chips where Crisps and not fries, but according to my husband that's a Brit thing. Honestly I didnt want a bag of potato chips, it didn't complement the burger in any way. It was interesting that they listed where all the ingredients were from. Not something we really look for but some people might really like that. Overall the service was great, the pastrie display was great and the decor was warm and friendy.

What really drew me into Commune is how everything they serve is locally grown and it's within a 200 mile radius. They even have their own farm in the back of the restaurant where they grow seasonal vegetables that they also serve. Not only is everything locally grown but they even have their own in house bakery where all their bakery goods and their bread is freshly made. I went on a Saturday afternoon and there was absolutely no wait at all. The servers were extremely friendly and very very informative. I ordered the sweet potato hash tots and it was to die for, when you take your first bite, you can see the shredded sweet potato pieces and it pairs so perfectly with their honey and honey mustard aioli. Let's not forget to mention my actual entrée as well, seriously so refreshing and so healthy. I felt like I was eating a garden and oddly enough, it was extremely tasty. If you're feeling healthy, but want to pig out without feeling guilty and don't want to break your diet, Commune is definitely the way to go! The only reason I knocked off a star is because I paid $8 for a mimosa and it was pretty small and I finished it way before I got my appetizer. Wouldn't suggest ordering mimosas if you want several, but the beers are fairly cheap and completely worth it."}, {"review_id": "o04lzxkCUEZ6RvyyLmpalA", "user_id": "G9N61V6yE-zcOCCyf1Uypg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Good brunch, the price was a little high but the food did not disappoint.

First of all, you are able to call ahead and put your name on the waitlist. This is the only breakfast place in Virginia Beach (that I know of) that allows you to do this. THANK YOU. So we waited a bit but it was a sunny day so we sat outside and took it all in. We were soon seated at a beautiful table featuring a flower arrangement that brought tears to my eyes (not allergies, just beauty). Our waitress was sweet as can be and so excited to tell us about the whole farm to table concept. She seemed to love working there, even on a busy Sunday. We started with the sweet potato hash, which was AMAZING. The honey and whatever the sauce was were the perfect touches, I probably could have ordered my own and had that as my meal. But thankfully I didnt, and instead got the eggs benedict ON THE MOST PERFECT BISCUIT IN THE WORLD. People. This dish was flawless. The biscuits, eggs, ham, and hollandaise was placed on a bed of lettuce which was actually the best addition and tasted great with the egg. Did I mention they put TWO ADORABLE FLOWERS ON TOP OF MY EGGS?!?!?! I felt like a princess. It was so beautiful. And delicious. I ate the whole thing. I got an iced drip coffee and it was a great size and tasted great. I only wish they had left the creamer on the table instead of walking around with it - I was too embarrassed that I needed a little more since I would love to give the illusion that I can drink basically black coffee like my roommate. My boyfriend and girl friend (lol) were equally impressed by the food and set up of this place. I cannot wait to try the new Norfolk location.

Commune is so worth the long, long wait for a table. My bf and I waited close to an hour for a table of two (and we ended just sitting at the bar because I was getting hangry).  The line at Commune seemed to only be getting longer, with only a handful of groups dropping out of their spots.  Yes, it's crazy crowded, but the food and service makes up for that.Drinks: I ordered the lavender latte, which was divine. It was the perfect amount of sweet.  My bf got the burnt honey latte, which was also delicious. Again, it wasn't too sweet and his had a \"smokey\" flavor to it. Food: Because our food took over 45 minutes to get to us, our waitress compensated us with a free appetizer. She brought out the pimento cheese and pickle board, which was really good. Interesting flavors for sure.  I ended up ordering the cornmeal waffles with sausage and OH MY GOD, it was AMAZING. Definitely hit the spot. The farm to table concept really shines through in their food. Everything was homemade and fresh. My bf got the classic breakfast sandwich, which he loved and definitely wished was bigger in size.  I also got a peach rosemary scone to go. This was one of the most unique scone flavors I have ever had.
