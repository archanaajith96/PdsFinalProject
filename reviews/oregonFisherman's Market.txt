Looks like a fish processing area behind the counter. The place really needs some love and attention. Seemed dirty and outdated, staff seemed stressed. We got the crab and shrimp Louis and the grilled halibut tacos. The food comes up pretty fast which is great when you have a one hour lunch. The food was fresh and great. The crab was previously frozen. The food was very good, however the seating needs help. Maybe the suggestion is to order your food to go. The bathroom is a hike, go outside and hike down the front of the building. Not a big fan. The crab did have quite a bit of shells in the meat."}, {"review_id": "lTffRhwDIgk9IR-5CS4OsA", "user_id": "8yoyeebZmEVUx47KhjK5QA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I love this place!!! Take your date here if she loves seafood. It smells amazing and they have so many options. The salmon on a stick was tasty and the dipping sauces were great too. I've heard that they get daily deliveries from the Oregon coast, so your fish should be quite fresh. I would definitely come back here for the variety.

You order by the counter and find a seat, they will call your number when the food is ready. The menu features items from fried fish n chips, fish tacos, pasta, sandwich, fresh seafood.... they are all great and fresh! There is a large sauce bar in the middle, which is for all the fried stuff. I especially enjoyed the Jalapeno tartar sauce, and Cajun spiced. Cajun Crawfish Pie  - Featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, A delicious mix of crawfish tail meat, yellow onion, celery, sweet bell peppers, and heavy cream in a flaky pie crust. Served with a fresh garden salad topped with smoked salmon and your choice of dressing. We ordered this because it was on DDD, but honestly it was the only dish that I didn't enjoy. The pie was very doughy and dense, the fillings were alright. I liked the refreshing salad on the side, but not so much the smoked salmon (very salty).All fish n chips baskets are served with criss-cut fries and your choice of honey-poppy seed or cilantro-lime coleslaw. The fried were fantastic, especially when it was hot! We tried both types of coleslaw, and the cilantro-lime was definitely the better one. It was a lot more light and refreshing, and didn't have as much mayo in it. Oyster shooter - these are so fresh, big, and only $1 each. Get them!!!Oysters n chips - FAVORITE dish today. There were 5 giant, juicy, fresh oyster, deep fried to perfection. When you bite into the pipping hot oyster, the juices just explode in your mouth. Get it!Cod n chips - 3 cod strips. This one was not as impressive as the oysters, but good nonetheless. The cod was fresh, but the slices were thin and not that juicy.Fried Calamari - the basket was decently sized, however the calamari were very small rings. I would prefer them bigger to have more juice. They were fried perfectly though.Favorites:* Oysters n chips ($8.99)* Cod n chips ($6.99)* Calamari ($5.99)* oyster shooter ($1 each)Others:* Cajun Crawfish Pie with salad ($11.99)"}, {"review_id": "BD7vGtBerLJ1Fg9lv4U4oQ", "user_id": "IxqSsHHiXa7lVPZvknQd2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Fish market dive restaurant - nothing fancy makes this the right place for people who care about food instead of atmosphere.

With all the options in Eugene I still choose this place above all else. Of course you do have to like seafood if you're going here, it's a legitimate seafood market with raw and smoked fish all around as well as live crabs and lobster, but...I come here for the food prepared on site. Everything from the crab dinner to the crawfish pie is delicious. My go to is straight up fish and chips. My favorite being halibut. The waffle fries are surprisingly good and remain crispy on the outside until the last bite.

Market style, tanks and fish on ice. Big steamer in the front. A local favorite, wooden tables, small dining area. There is a covered patio outside, there is a heater for the chilly days. I wanted to try it all but settled for traditional fish and chips, clam chowder and Cole slaw. They had a lot of varieties of tartar sauces. There was a sauce station that included the ketchup, hot sauces, other condiments. Two bathrooms in the back of the restaurant, you need a key to get to it. Overall pretty clean, it didn't smell too fishy. You can order grilled or fried versions of seafood and there were two versions of coleslaw (cilantro & poppyseed) the former was healthier. I didn't love the coleslaw, it was fresh but lacked flavor, but I do like the extra fiber. The fried shrimp was my favorite, juicy, seasoned and crispy. Clam chowder was next favorite, the halibut, cod and salmon all moist and meaty."}, {"review_id": "Vqdu0A-NEIkOe1wjb860aw", "user_id": "j4_1iTRs5VCXtEJbuSf1EQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/22/2017", "text": "There's not a lot of parking in front, but there's a parking lot across the street!Ordered the Dungeness crab dinner w/ soup and salad + a side of clam strips.$35 total.The crab was okay. 3/5.

To start, you must get an oyster shooter. Only a $1 and sooo fresh and flavorful. The oysters were almost creamy? And the homemade cocktail sauce... just... ugh. Their oysters really test my reasonings on becoming a vegetarian... Their fish and chips are also very good! Never dry and always hot and juicy! You have to be careful when eating them because hot oil might explode upon first bite. They also offer a wide variety of tartar sauces. My favorite was the cajun one! So flavorful! I'd also recommend their clam chowder as well; they don't jip you with their clams. When they mean clam chowder, they mean clamss chowder. Okay, I've tried a lot more on their menu but I have to stop getting into it because I'm really tempted to just stop this vegetarian lifestyle.... but I won't! So I'd definitely recommend this place for all you non-vegetarians, just promise to enjoy them for me!"}, {"review_id": "N0AajqKQSsEYko72L4Umiw", "user_id": "f3ckblgCR17SxxYkKiudoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Great local towne fish shop.
