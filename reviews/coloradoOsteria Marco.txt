They hand stretch their mozzarella every morning which I already knew then I was going to love this place. Got the mozzarella appetizer and the pepper shaved on top just added this delicious smokey flavor. Main dish was the baked rigatoni. Holy. Moly. This was life changing!!! Dreaming about this meal. The dish came to me with the cheese still bubbling. The sauce was so earthy and had this delicious spice to it. Highly highly recommend this place to anyone. Won't disappoint!!!!"}, {"review_id": "xgSo-iHh2hrg9o8LuQQbtQ", "user_id": "ZOqsO4yqsv2_wlVH9D-tIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Immediately after getting my brain filled with great ideas from day 1 of my symposium, I needed to get away from the hotel where I was staying.\"Hey, buddy, how does some wood fired pizza with wine sound?,\" my brain asked.\"Sounds like a plan!!\", my stomach replied.So, I came to Osteria Marco and got settled at the bar. Took almost no time for my wine order. And, I was pleasantly surprised by an excellent fig and goat cheese pizza with arugula and truffle oil. Crisp and light crust married to sweet and tart figs with a chaser of white wine was a great end to a busy day.Highly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "Wc6PTAnWC3drydM9xEur0Q", "user_id": "ODDJwZR_7l8ie6O2VUl6pg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "We had an exceptional dinner.  I couldn't believe how knowledgeable Jordan was about the wine and food menu.  We had the Burrata was fantastic as well as the lamb meatballs.

Though I'm usually a bar girl, the corner tall top was perfect for our group.Our server was awesome. He created two off-menu cocktails based on flavors my co-workers were looking for. Both were a bit.Though the drink list was tempting, I'd had my heart set on the amaro flight since the minute my plane landed in Denver. My colleague and I shared 8 unique tastes from OM's amazing collection.Good music, fab drinks, outstanding bar staff. My only complaint is that this place is too far from Phoenix. Please expand to Arizona!! Can't wait to return."}, {"review_id": "NmBNKMaM2E9DnjUfgO2kNA", "user_id": "gec9uCNQnrgELZ6Xaz-Scg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "This is our family night spot downtown. It is one of the only places around here that I can bring the kids to without feeling guilty.They don't have a kids menu, but are willing to make a cheese pizza or grilled cheese for your kiddo.I like to stick with the meat and cheese plates along with getting a salad.It is a pizza place and their pizza is good. I just like the charcuterie and housemade cheeses here more.We were seated at 630pm and out the door by 7:15. Food comes out quickly, and kids are done eating and gone before they get fussy or bored.My only complaint was the restrooms. They were closed on the 24th, 25th, and 26th for lunch. They were only a couple of hours into dinner service and the bathrooms were gross.Unfortunately having small ones means you have to use the restroom at some point during the visit. I have experienced better there and hope it was a one-off weird scenario."}, {"review_id": "BLwk3tqJhqN0jDXvegmLZg", "user_id": "biDcWi6b_KUgGGLq6GNTsQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Had such a wonderful dinner here Saturday night.

Also, our server Nolan was one of the best servers I've had! He knew the menu inside and out, had great advice in ordering, and was fun! He really made the experience great.

Yes, this place is always packed and everyone loves it but I don't think I'll ever need to come back here again. We ordered mussels which came out fairly quickly for how busy it was but each mussel had sand in it, it was gross. They got us a new order which was a little better but still sand in some of them. The pizza was really good, I'm not gonna lie but I wouldn't make a trip here for the pizza alone. Everything else on the menu was overpriced for what the place is in my opinion. We were able to find some seats at the bar that night and we did receive great service from the bartenders. Our experience wasn't too terrible but there are other restaurants I prefer and love more that I'd rather visit."}, {"review_id": "yI1hO-6UWBQIuFXbleR24g", "user_id": "Fl4MGH2V9Iy4ZihMJItdmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Lamb meatballs were great, mussels appetizer was a great portion, and butterscotch bread pudding was fantastic and not too sweet nor too milky.

Hoping for a table at that time was a mistake, as the wait time was over 2 hours. We did however find two spots at the bar and had a drink and dinner there instead. The cocktail list wasn't overwhelming, and the bartenders were very knowledgeable and willing to make drinks not listed. I had the chicken with mascarpone mashed potatoes and my husband had the pork chops. They were both excellent. Everything was cooked to perfection, and those mashed potatoes were FIRE. I was a little bummed that they didn't have any pasta choices on the menu, but honestly, I wouldn't have picked the chicken and I would have missed out on a such a great meal!

We were so impressed by our prompt seating and the excellent service. We also do not have extensive wine knowledge so we were gently guided and swayed by our knowledgeable server. It was much appreciated. A few menu items stuck out to me. The dinner salad was excellent, and the burrata was so creamy and delicious with honey and arugula. The stand our menu item for us was the fig and goat cheese pizza. We literally will be back for that pizza only. Then, I got the eggplant parmigiana which was perfectly vegetarian and delicious. All the tastes and flavors were perfectly matched with ambiance. This restaurant was massive and held an exuberant class and quality that you would expect from a first-class Larimer Square restaurant. We were recommended a couple glasses of a red Italian wine of a variety I can't remember.

Osteria Marco is the only restaurant in downtown Denver that offers shrimp pizza. The pizza was good, although the dough could have used a little more salt. We also had the arugula and Parmesan salad which was delicious. The restaurant gets 4 stars for food.Unfortunately, our experience with our waiter and the atmosphere was not as impressive. The tables are too close together -- no private conversations or elbow room. Our waiter was not happy that we opted out on appetizers, drinks, and a large entree and treated us like second class citizens from that point forward.

If that makes any sense. Lots of beautiful metal with wood accents. Very lovely space. The stairway that one takes to go down into the dining hall area is beautifully wide.Ease of Menu:The menu seemed rather straightforward. There was a significant jump in prices between Panini's, pizzas and full entrées.Service:- I did notice my friend ordered the trout but upon being served, it was salmon on the plate and not trout. - I ordered a Cesar salad starter, a ciabatta bread starter plate and a pizza to share. But when our food arrived, the server delivered the salad then the pizza but forgot to bring the ciabatta plate. The whole point of us ordering the ciabatta bread plate was so that we could share it amongst our friends who were very hungry. we had a reservation. It's not like the wait staff didn't know our party was coming. The server disappeared for about 10 minutes after delivering the salad. We asked the server for our ciabatta bread plate which was never delivered and the server disappeared again for 10 to 15 minutes. (It is obvious that she forgot to enter it into the computer which would indicate that the kitchen never knew they had to make it.) At that moment our pizza entrée was delivered. We still did not have our ciabatta bread plate. But at that point it didn't really matter because the whole purpose, again, was to snack on the bread while we were waiting for our entrées. Once we had our entrées there was really no need for an appetizer to be delivered.I should say that I was not upset or frustrated at all. I just thought it was a little unorganized, and there was no communication. We wanted to tell the server not to worry about the bread plate and wanted her to just to take it off the order since it apparently didn't get on the ticket in the first place but the server quickly ran off before we could even open our mouths to tell her not to bring it out. Again, this isn't maddening, it was just a bit confusing. The server could also have comp'd it, which she didn't do either.- We had a friend at the table who was celebrating a birthday. We provided a cake, brought it in and communicated with the staff beforehand that we would love for them to cut the cake and serve it. I'm sure that every establishment feels differently about this. The staff at this establishment agreed to accommodate with no issues. However when they took the cake back to cut it, there were only 10 of us and it took the wait staff about 15 to 20 minutes to cut, plate and deliver cake to our table. Now... It does not take 15 to 20 minutes to cut cake especially if the restaurant isn't busy, which it wasn't. I feel that the restaurant should be very clear with communicating their service and their standards. If allowing patrons to bring in their own cake and if providing cutting and serving of said cake, the staff should also be able to deliver the cake to the table with some sort of priority. Otherwise why not just tell patrons that they're welcome to cut and serve the cake themselves at the table. We had 2 to 3 friends at the table that I ended up having to leave without eating any celebratory birthday cake because they couldn't wait any longer before leaving for the night. This was a little awkward. I understand if the place was slammed on the weekend but it was a weeknight and the place was not that busy at all. Feedback: - There were approximately 10 people at our table. Several of my friends who gathered at the dining table kept mentioning how loud it was. All of us dined on a Monday night and the establishment did not seem to be at full capacity yet we were having to raise our voices and repeat ourselves because the place was so loud. A couple of our friends at the table said they have been there on the weekends when it is too loud to carry on a conversation. Perhaps Osteria Marco can research sound dampening acoustic panels which could easily be placed on the interior walls and or ceiling.- I would encourage the management and the staff to train more on communicating clearly with patrons. Humans make mistakes and that is a part of life. Humans can also fix those mistakes... which should also be a part of life.- All in all, the food was terrific and delightful. I would highly recommend dining at this establishment. Allow the waitstaff to fumble through their issues."}, {"review_id": "ueJiShRN4gxory4VvlWRpA", "user_id": "vLfUqVNc9_puqDP2yWatJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "I adored my dining experience at Osteria Marco.

The service was superb. We had the charcuterie, oysters, lamb meatballs with polenta and ricotta (perfectly smooth and smoky sauce), rabbit with spinach and bacon (so tender!), butterscotch bread pudding with gelato, and Nutella and lavender jam donuts.

Then courted nutritional-carb disaster with a prosciutto / arugula / mozzarella / Marzano tomato pizza.
