The cup of chili was good as an appetizer. My main course, the ominous-sounding End Burger, featured horseradish havarti, an over easy egg, tomato, caramelized onions, shredded lettuce, and truffle aioli, which is a fancy name for mayo.The burger was ordered medium, but was a little south of medium well - zero hint of pink. I was a little concerned about the power of the horseradish to overpower the burger, but it actually could have used more; likewise on the mayo. If I ordered it again, I'd order extra of both on the side. Once I broke the egg yoke, I couldn't really taste either of the other two any longer.The fries were disappointing. Very seasoned but on the well done side - no longer crispy but more at pre-burnt. The onion rings were better with the large cuts and plentiful battering.The Viking Lamb Burger came with cucumber sauce, feta-olive relish, and veggies. Again, because lamb is so lean, a little more of the dressings may have evened out the natural dryness of the meat.There are a few other items on the menu I would like to try, but I would either sit in the bar area or order a to-go order next time since the service was really disappointing. The wait staff of a more high-end restaurant should know the menu intimately. Each waitress/waiter should be fully knowledgeable on every single dish and ingredient. Our waitress was lacking in her ability to answer questions on the individual dishes, outside of \"that's one of my personal favorites.\"In addition, when I requested leftover containers, she did not offer to box up the items, even though it was slow; she only had two other tables, and there was plenty of time. I also requested some additional ketchup containers for the enormous amount of burnt fries I had left over. Instead of bringing me sealed to-go containers of ketchup, she actually brought me the empty plastic containers to salvage what I had left from my meal.I may be being petty, but if I am spending $75 on a meal, and that is without alcohol or dessert, those are some very minor extras that go a long way. In addition, since I was doing all the work, that turned my usual $20+ tip into a seven dollar tip. Beyond the amazing ambiance, the restaurant had little else to offer on this inaugural visit."}, {"review_id": "SqNURWiNYTTeo4Fkll3TPw", "user_id": "_Tvz1PBlBVmJ9rKWX3v6Hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Wow!!!

There are 4 burgers that are vegetarian friendly with 1 being vegan friendly (along with other items, like salads and appetizers). I ordered the black bean burger solely on the promise of the habanero mustard. This was a letdown, as the burger was not spicy at all. It mostly had decent flavor, I was disappointed at the lack of spice. It also lacked structural integrity - as many veggie burgers do, the black bean patty did not hold its shape. The onion rings were decent as onion rings go. They were huge - on average, about the same size as the burgers, and not overly greasy. Where the batter was thick, though, it was doughy. The beer list was extensive and featured many local beers. What's really amazing about Bru is the space. It's a reclaimed bus station - actually the Greyhound Art Deco prototype for all the other Midwest Art Deco Greyhound stations. The neon outside is original, and there are gorgeous original touches inside. Overall, I'm really glad to see vegetarian friendly food at a place you might assume would be veggie hostile, and the food was pretty decent. I'd absolutely eat there again, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}, {"review_id": "YVZxjw3EW6lLcJrww4wGNg", "user_id": "qvtf-_JuZen1FYgVz7VHmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Brew burger was awesome they have some delicious and unique style burgers and are huge.

First off, it's in the old Greyhound Bus terminal, which is a very cool, art deco building, that has been left to die for many years. A+ on the reno!We came in at lunch during the Christmas season, and the place was packed. The wife did a basic burger, and I opted for the Bourbon Burger (Horseradish Hvarti cheese, and bacon), with fries. The fries are fresh cut, and come with homemade ketchup. Very good. Both of us enjoyed the burgers, and thought they match up to some of the better burger joints we've dined at.Being Scott B., I ordered a craft beer with my burger. Bru has an amazing tap selection, and I made the right call by opting for a Taxman stout. Damn, one of the better brews I've ever sampled; but, at $8 this seemed high, especially for a local brew, in Southern Indiana.Very good burgers, cool ambience, great service, and a damn good selection of craft brews.
