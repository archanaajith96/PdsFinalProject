The pimento cheese added some nice sharpness under the chicken.  A side of beautifully breaded, crispy fried pickles with blue cheese dressing to dip in was a great combo with a very good sandwich."}, {"review_id": "vcrblS3TFBaJ7lxkmE3bDQ", "user_id": "TnokU_E5RiaUWTlRy4D-hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "We were looking for a quick place to eat before a movie and this was right down the street. Love the set up - casual and fun. I got the buffalo and the fried green tomatoes.  ITV of these did not let me down. The fried green tomatoes were some of the best I've ever had. My husband had the Not So Waffle. He liked the sandwich but wasn't the biggest fan of the Bacon Jam - kind of a different taste but not bad in my opinion. The fries were very good. They do have chicken tenders for kids if you need that"}, {"review_id": "EDf_AcYv3VfmVN40zBNQ1Q", "user_id": "Ku6kM8PmU3dd_ORJggBdNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Betty!

Get it together guys cuz Betty ain't messin roun ya heard??I'm pretty sure I heard a legion of 1,000 harps play every time I took a bite. The Sweet Potato Fries, the Sandwich, the honey mustard, the syrup... all the best I've ever had. It was almost a spiritual experience.The Chicken \"Not So Waffle\" Sandwich was perfection. The bun was slightly sweet, the tomato was crisp and fresh, the chicken was more moist and packed with flavor."}, {"review_id": "oiZCQEK1Mf01s-SkZDuDDA", "user_id": "RhX5YNurOSl3nG3n_QamVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "You have to really be looking to find this little gem.

Yes, the best I've ever had actually. Every bite is actually amazing. All of the toppings work and compliments the fried chicken well. It does get messy eating, but no worries, by the time you notice, you've already eaten it all. Boxcar Sandwich is filled with pimento cheese, peach slaw, house pickles, and spicy mayo. I enjoyed every aspect of it and honestly wanted to wait in line for another one. The portion of chicken is appropriate to the toppings and bun. I had a few bites of Chicken \"Not So Waffle\" and it's amazing as well. The maple syrup adds the right amount of sweetness to each bite and really works. Handcut Fries are standard. But, back to the chicken sandwiches.. It truly lives up to the hype. Even with the line and busy atmosphere, every second was totally worth it. I like how simple their menu is as well. It makes the ordering process so much better since you don't need to ask the cashier a bunch of questions.Parking was a little stressful. Waiting in line to order got a little stressful because it looks overwhelmingly busy. Waiting around for a table to sit down and eat can get stressful since you're literally standing over people eating trying to get to a table first. BUT, I already want to go back and eat more fried chicken sandwiches. Like ASAP."}, {"review_id": "t31WtfrN89S8is41cVQYmw", "user_id": "KYAR9aJPK7WtE-tFrHHltg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "12/17Fried pickle redemption! Cooked perfectly! Heading up north so what's a southern girl going to do? Get the best dang fried chicken, pimento cheese, and slaw sandwich ever made! Consistent friendly service as the endless lines of customers stream through the door. No gmo's organic always a plus!5/30/17So my pickles were over done and they don't give you enough ranch. That's the first time they over fried my pickles but they still tasted good so I ate them. The boxcar is a southerners dream sandwich. Pimento cheese why yaas! Juicy fried chicken that is hormone free and simple goodness. Yum. A splurge for sure diet wise but hey I'll be out of the south for awhile so had to get my fix!Self control to the max! That darn sandwich is golden but after a very heavy culinary weekend, I decided to try the chopped chicken salad. Did not disappoint and was really good. Almost good enough to cure my jealousy of those French fry gobbling, fried pickle stuffing sand which wolfing patrons next to me!"}, {"review_id": "xz_swqTYwdkAYucR6AUV9A", "user_id": "o9ZAADbKKzp1mwe_RZXxRQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I have been hearing from co-workers and friends that this is an excellent lunch joint.  While they do have a limited menu, what is available is excellent.  I had the boxcar with a side of fried green tomatoes.  The boxcar was excellent, the toppings did not overwhelm the chicken.  I was afraid the peach slaw would be too sweet combined with the pickles and pimento cheese but I was wrong.  It was all a perfect combination.  And whenever a place offers fried green tomatoes, I make a point of trying them.  And they were good as well.  Not too heavily breaded or soggy.  I do feel like the breading would have benefited from a few spices instead of relying on the dipping sauce.  But, it is still a good decision to try them. The line can get long at lunchtime, but it moves well and food is served quickly.  While it is not a large place, there were not any problems finding parking or a table."}, {"review_id": "TeXpvtqsIjfiwiUt0VdW1g", "user_id": "rk2ZkhhideZxVOdXNFQl5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "I've been to this place twice now and both times the food has been delicious! Definitely one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had. The menu is small but when you do something so right, you don't need a big menu. It's a reasonably-priced too which is extra great. If you live in West Ashley there's no excuse to not visit. Skip the Chick-Fil-A that is down the road and come here instead! For both visits I've had the boxcar sandwich with fried chicken and a side of fries. I also shared a side of fried pickles. The boxcar sandwich has pimento cheese and pickles on it and it's just a great combination. The chicken was very juicy and although it was messy to eat, I would eat it again any day. The fries and fried pickles were also perfectly cooked. The pickles come with a side of ranch dip as well. My vegetarian friend was able to enjoy her meal too as you can put in mushrooms instead of chicken in any sandwich! The parking lot is VERY small though, so be wary of that if you're coming in on the weekend around meal time. It's worth the struggle to find parking though, definitely."}, {"review_id": "fZm_p8TK3zoqvhjmeIbKKQ", "user_id": "AnFMQiwbuTqCVmDf2a5rjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "The Good:1. Very different ingredients on the sandwiches, (ie peach coleslaw, bacon jam,and maple syrup) but good together2. Eclectic decor, with distressed tables, chairs, and posters.3. Acoustics good; music in the background, but low enough you can carry on a conversation without having to shout.The Not-So Good1.Hubby got the Boxcar, said it tasted good,  but too many ingredients on it made the bread soggy. 2. Very limited menu. Chicken tenders for kids, chicken sandwiches and salads for the adults ( if vegetarian they do offer Portobello mushrooms instead of  chicken).3. A little pricey for chicken sandwiches, fries, and a drink...came to $15 a piece.All in all I'd recommend if you want to try a different take on chicken sandwiches."}, {"review_id": "WtefNj8VOw2HDTNqxAbL2A", "user_id": "_gcNAoz_uErYpZ0GNMZTSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Best chicken sandwiches I've EVER had.

You walk in and order basically right when walking in, so check out the website for the menu if you are a first timer.

I'm starting to accept that if everything was perfect no matter how casual the location it still gets all 5. This is another example of that scenario. It is obvious that there is attention to detail on all items of this menu. Simple, yes.  Extremely yummo, absolutely yes. Nothing fancy but all good. If you want an awesome chicken sandwich, great fries and a beer/soda-This is the place. We came after 2pm and ordered, sat down, ate, cleaned my messy face, and left in about 20 minutes. I'm very  and full. I ordered the Boxcar and posted a pic. Slightly messy but just be prepared and focus on the sandwich!! Enjoy every drop of sauce, cheese, jam, etc. I would drive an hour to eat here for lunch. If I lived in Charleston I'd probably be a regular. Thx to all the staff, you all care about your job and work hard. Headed to Hootie and The Blowfish concert. Another year has passed and another reunion weekend with the band.

This was my first time here and I was impressed by the food. I'm not really a huge fan of burgers or sandwiches with a ton of odd toppings on them, but this sandwich was the rare exception. The chicken, the sauce, pickles, and the coleslaw vibe really works for it. Also, not everyone can pull off sweet potato fries with real flavor; Boxcar Betty's were great and had a ton of flavor. I wish that this location was a tad bit bigger. My boyfriend and I got there right before it started to get busy and we barely found a seat. I love that the owner/cook came out to check on us and to ensure that our food was ok. Great customer service is really key!
