We came late night, so it was definitely a bar crowd. The atmosphere was fun and low key, and the drinks were really good. We drank margaritas and dirty martinis which were both awesome. For food, we tried the new york steak sandwich which was very good! I was impressed by how tender the steak was. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and was not lacking in size. For $20, it was well worth it. The burger was nothing to write home about it."}, {"review_id": "TamPxn6u1NdRPwtQaddS4A", "user_id": "AXQ2D8RqGrfGucjHcCQHHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Halibut is delicious and a very nice friendly atmosphere. Food prices range from $14-$21. Soups being cheaper. I ordered the halibut fish and chips. They were $21 but such a large portion. I believe I got 9-12 pieces of halibut and a ton of fries. The tartar sauce is a little sweet but I love it. I sat in front of the open kitchen. Was fun to watch the cooks cooking all Happy and friendly. I will come by here again. Want to try their sandwiches. Mmmm or their caesar."}, {"review_id": "oc_CkZIXetP-Sk01W1QR8Q", "user_id": "BQLc7jSHfPXDvleNFJ6lyg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "This is a good local bar to come in and grab a drink and food.

It's served with fries or soup or salad . I suggest the salad . It's fresh and crisp and just a little bit healthier . I love a place that allows a little bit of flexibility in their menu . You can't walk into FStreet without feeling like you are a true Alaskan . Everyone there looks like they have an interesting story  to tell . The staff is warm and professional . I can't write a review about FStreet without mentioning the humongous block of cheese they always have at the bar ... you will have to stop in to learn the rest of that story ."}, {"review_id": "9SfiSSoZ84tQ6x3LixQ-MQ", "user_id": "696zcGY1Kiycwz_GeSaiYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "A happening place for locals and a few tourists.We ordered calamari and the shrimp... wow, both very fresh and no doubt sourced locally.I can't say this place is totally inexpensive, but hey, it's Alaska.Service at the bar was great, helpful and very friendly."}, {"review_id": "jT_3tZ_9rsyGXpFGjC3jdg", "user_id": "JA1iXUGIBKeCLE2Vvjis1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "It's no wonder My boyfriend doesn't like seafood. He came from anchorage Alaska where the seafood is as fresh as it gets! I didn't believe how different fish can taste between California to Las Vegas to Alaska until I was able to try it for the first time today! The fried halibut here disintegrates in your mouth! It's the seafood equivalent to a good rack of ribs! This place actually has battered fish that contain more fish than batter, which is unheard of in most places I've experienced! Most places have batter so big that there is a hollowness inside before you even see the shrimp or fish! Not here!!! They're not stingy with their fish portions, thats for sure! Oysters!! I'm not going to NOT to ham on seafood in a place that prides themselves on seafood! 3 words: oh my gahhhhh! Even the battered fried shrimps were to die for! Finally a place that gives fish and chips a good go for the money! It's not just filler food, it's quality!"}, {"review_id": "c6yfz38JcpWCmUd2BQ4HYA", "user_id": "8NzUBQpgiu_o7777-lOj2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "This is one of my top favorite places of all times. Everything on the menu is amazing. I've ordered it all and it has all been great. You also can't beat the atmosphere. One of my favorite Sunday fun day places for sure but I honestly go there all the time. Whether you're sitting at the bar, by the kitchen or on one fo the tables, you are sure to have fun and enjoy F street. Some of my favs (even though the entire menu is great): French onion soup, chicken pasta salad, New York steak sandwich, grilled chicken sandwich, the GRILLED HALBIT SANDWICH (one of my favorite sandwiches EVER, add cheese and the jalapeño sauce if you know what's up), the oysters (always fresh from AK), Alaskan butter clams, the calamari, and their eggs Benedict (available only in the am). Their specials are also epic so make sure to check them out while you're there. Don't miss the hilarious quotes changed every week and their huge block of cheese, that yes, is for customers."}, {"review_id": "AUGMfKdcMxgiyTsIvdtfLw", "user_id": "Yd2h65aTJfoJygutZz3lJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Though this is my first check in, I've been here numerous time. Definitely a popular local place. Mix of all types. Food is fantastic! Fresh fish served everyday. The first time I ventured in 4 years ago, I went in for lunch. I watched the chef/cook slice fresh Halibut that had just come in used to make my meal. 5 stars then 5 stars today. Served with fresh cut fries soup or salad Salmon the same. Cod the same. Usually a special every night. Had a Halibut Special during one visit .. 5 stars again. Servers and bartenders were prompt 20% well deserved. F street is pretty busy on the weekends and nights. Don't expect to sit right away.. grad a beer and be patient. Lunch time during the week least busy... or maybe anytime before 7pm. Add a sticker to the wall if you want to leave your mark. Lastly, there's a candy bowl on the bar, don't be greedy! Have a piece... sweet craving cured.

It's either the halibut fish n chips, or the steak sandwich which I order without bread, or the scallops and shrimp with pasta. The service is good, the crowd is usually vibrant, the drinks are good. The food is LEGIT!! And the food is very good.  I digress.

It is a bar, with a kitchen built in the middle. They serve the freshest seafood, done professionally, in front of your face. It is better than Seattle, Portland, and certainly Chicago, in terms of fresh and comfort style, casual, seafood.Halibut fish and chips, The best. Make it a combo with shrimp. The special silver salmon, you will never enjoy farm salmon the same again.The grilled Halibut sandwich might be the best thing I have ever eaten on a bun, anywhere.

(It all runs together.) Except I can say that I've never had a bad meal nor bad service there. Since I moved to the Valley 14 years ago, husband and I stop for lunch there every month or so and The Street NEVER disappoints. Today's lunch special was a panini and soup was vegetable beef. Per chef's suggestion, I added horseradish to my portion of the soup and it was fantastic. And the panini was so good that my picky eater ate more than half. Because it's required that we have the excellent Caesar salad, the soup plus my sandwich and the super-yummy fries pushed us over the edge. SO we had a wonderful lunch (with great service from Lori) while being entertained by the chefs and now have leftovers for dinner. We love F Street Station.

It's very, very busy everytime we've been here and you've got to keep a good eye for people about to leave. I've never seen an open seat before waiting a good 20/40 minutes for something to open up.Bartenders, servers, and cooks are always pleasant. So grab a beer while you wait and when you finally get that seat, you'll be taken care of by the friendly staff.Food=there menu has yet to disappoint me. We came for oysters and they were out, but.... it was a Saturday evening so we'll let that slide. We ordered the clams and an entree with scallops/shrimp (half and half) mushrooms and a buttery sauce and rotini pasta. Both were delicious. Garlic bread was on point as well. Drinks=they had about 5-10 beers on draft and a full bar. Parking=weekend street parking is free. The vibe in here was fun, loud, busy and just a friendly unpretentious bar.Last but not least the cheese block... if you like sharing bar food with random strangers, then go for it!"}, {"review_id": "VksZ3KWMqdnKCcy9ciKfNQ", "user_id": "jnFSdEM4uYPab2vRvh4sPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "The trolley guide recommended this place for lunch - glad we listened. Just across the street from the visitor center, it's easy to find, super casual and the food was great. Had a $25 salmon Caesar but it was huge and the fillet was enormous. Salmon spread appetizer was OK. Nothing great. Tasted more like cream cheese than salmon.  Burger was tasty. Soup of the day was black bean chili and it was killer. The service was excellent as well.  I'd come here again anytime.

Then there was a waitress walk by, I asked her if I can order food from her, she answered I need to order from bar then just walked away. I watched the bartender talking from another 5 minutes then I had enough.

We just stopped in for a quick beer before we had to leave anchorage! They were very nice and the place is awesome! It's an original bar of anchorage with a sort of aviation tribute to it with stickers all over! My husband and I got a kick out the community giant block of cheese and crackers! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because we didn't have time to try the food! Hope to back one day!

What a downtown gem! Cool and casual -- but seating is very limited and is not only \"first come, first serve\"  but also a \"you snooze, you lose\" type game, so people are definitely on the prowl when people start paying for their check! Very loud, but in a good way, this place is full of personality! Grabbed a drink at the bar while waiting for a table to free up (moscow mule for me, beer for my friend) -- and while typical bars sometimes have bowls of nuts, this one had a giant block of cheese! Carve yourself a piece, grab some crackers and have at it! Not sure how sanitary this is, but what bar is? Haha.I ordered:SOUR DOUGH CRAB SANDWICH- Sweet red crab meat tossed in a pepper herb dressing on warm sourdough bread -- served with soup, salad or fries.
