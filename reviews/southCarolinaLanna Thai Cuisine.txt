When entering we were greeted and seated right away. It was off to a great start. It was very busy, since it was lunch time (also a great sign) but no matter, our server quickly came over to introduce herself. She gathered our drink order and when she returned to take our entrées I asked for pho tai.. She looked at me like I ordered baby back ribs with a side of onion rings. I repeated myself again and she looked just as bewildered. So I pointed to it and she replied \"Oh, a number 7?\". Good grief woman! I said yes and asked if it came with green onions or cilantro. She said \"no onion but cilantro and the spice green circles\". Holy shit!?! Really? I told her I just wanted the beef, broth and noodles. It came out with everything so my little one and I sat picking out the greenery for the first five mins and the server approached during that time to check on us. She walked up to the table and said \"you can tell me next time you don't want those?\" I reminder her the conversation we had not long ago and she gave me a look of offense. This place was decent and the food was pretty good but the service was absolutely bizarre. We'll go somewhere else in the future."}, {"review_id": "6ez5MvMsEgGgGscV8DeKqQ", "user_id": "QvJNbPn8BlY2A6BoUZ-MoA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Last night I fought through the traffic from hell on Ashley Phosphate to get to Lanna Thai Cuisine.  We were craving pho and after reading all the Yelp reviews and seeing how highly rated Lanna was we decided to go there for takeout. I pulled into the parking lot and it just seemed off; all those good reviews and the place wasn't very busy (on Valentine's Day), not to mention the parking lot full of kittens (no pun intended). I let all that slip and went in to order our takeout. After ordering it took about 20 minutes to get our food, which wasn't bad. I have to say the young lady working the register that took my order was very polite. As I waited a couple of more tables came in, but it didn't really get busy. So my order comes out and I head home. Upon opening I was disappointed to see the broth for my pho only filled 1/2 of the container and the small coconut soup we got only filled 1/2 of it's container. We ordered the beef and brisket pho, tom ka gai soup, and chicken satay. Everything was very tasty, but for $30 I have to say I was disappointed because it's like we only got 1/2 of what we ordered. I will probably give them another shot and dine in, but hopefully the soup will be full."}, {"review_id": "XpbJiaTB4x-MVtt0TSIlSQ", "user_id": "YLpDfqgnFf3JfnAQuV73Tw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Really good food but when literally everyone in the restaurant who arrived after you had their food and your table doesn't, that's just ridiculous.

I had reviewed them long ago but since they're no longer called Hibachi Grill, that review is long gone with the Yelp business listing. I used to always get their hibachi chicken & shrimp. I'd call ahead, and then come to pick up through their drive-thru. I live in the 'hood behind the restaurant so I always appreciated the yummy hibachi and the convenience! For just over $10, I'd get a container chock-full of rice, veggies, sweet carrots, chicken & shrimp, along with a choice of soup or salad. It was easily two meals. Later I started trying their Pho. Maybe even better to go! They put the noodles & broth in separate containers so if there are leftovers, you just heat up the broth really well, add remainder of the ingredients and it's just as good reheated. Same as the hibachi, the pho is a large serving. I don't think it's on the menu, but you can order a half portion of the pho! Suggested this spot to my bestie so she could check out their Thai options, so we hit it up for lunch not long ago. She loved it! She took my suggestions of the pad woon sen (chicken) and I order the pad prik (pork). Consistently delicious! Including the fresh basil rolls which used to be on the menu as summer rolls.I'm happy that although ownership has changed hands (this might be the third name change but with a similar menu), the quality and quantity of the food hasn't changed. I've gotten take out and eaten in the restaurant several times. Always good, friendly service, always tasty reasonably priced eats. Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "J4uYKnf9RC7Tqnupnbc3xQ", "user_id": "InkbdRvz35C95IbupEXzDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "Well, this was different. Never had Thai so don't have a comparison, but I can say the flavor was clean and not uneatable. :) It's just not my style so not a flavor I can take much of. It wasn't hot  at all, I got medium, but really was wishing for some heat. That might have helped. My bf did get hot but we didn't taste that in his either. I don't remember the name of the dish I got, but it was flat noodles with chicken.The place is deceptive driving in, the outside is nothing like the inside. It's rather cute inside, fun lights, clean, love the way the napkins are folded. And the servers wear purple t-shirts, which I loved, since it's my favorite color! This was a trial run for me, my bf has been wanting me to go, so to keep the peace I went. LOL! It was worth the adventure, and it's not as bad as I thought. So if you're new to Thai, give it a try (whoops rhymed), you just might like it."}, {"review_id": "b-wOo2A-xBV-SPoUAenVBQ", "user_id": "Kik9UOmh_7F5lvKmYNwIQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "A great spot to stop in when driving in/out of Chas or near the airport. The exterior is not the most prepossessing, but the food is satisfying and the service is friendly and quick. We've come here twice, and gotten the massaman curry, crispy egg noodle special, pad see ew, and house special pho, and larb salad. Everything tastes fresh and they will dial in the spice level for you. I suspect that they gave us the \"non-Asian\" spice level (I'm Asian but my spouse isn't) because the spice level 4 (out of 5) barely registered as spicy for me (I tend to have a high heat tolerance though!) None of the items is in the category of \"best xx I've ever had\", but all have been good enough that we have returned!Thai iced teas always hit the spot as well."}, {"review_id": "J65LPb70B9SX78dqGKQ9dg", "user_id": "3ycyux8899WSBAE-LPvMDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2017", "text": "Don't let the location possibly scare you away. This is some legit Thai food and worth the drive. It's set up in an old fast food joint. It's a family run business and they know what they're doing. I loved the Thai iced tea.

The Tom Ka Gai soup was good, but I still like Mei Thai's better. Definitely a great Thai place if you're in the area.

You roll up to the restaurant and think this looks like a fast food building converted into thai/Japanese/vietnamese cuisine. They even still utilize the drive thru and you can now order curry or pho from your car! Who would have thought that day would have come. Lanna's utilizes their space and you can tell they have tried to up the atmosphere with some fancy lights. One thing I do notice is the old flooring from where a hot buffet used to be. There's a variety of seating with a decent amount of booths. The food is tasty and pretty reasonable lunch prices. Curries and rice/noodle dishes range from about 7 to 11 bucks during lunch. I personally enjoy the Red curry and ordering it hot. It never seems to get that hot status though but I'm not risking thai hot. Overall this place is a good lunch stop. Don't expect to get super fast business but enough to leave you happy with some Thai in your belly, some money still in your wallet, and some time away from the office."}, {"review_id": "-iLj9WzGf8tTpqq3HzH3sg", "user_id": "zJYybTYEDyhMGR5IqeMobA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "This is a solid Thai and Pho place.

Which makes sense since they want it hot and only serve it that way . So here it goes the spicy thai spaghetti was very hot , just the way i ordered it. A perfect blend of red and green peppers with some basil as well. This establishment is very well ran and organized i will say and they pay close attention to detail. This was my first time here, i pass this place daily and kept wondering what it would be like to try it for the first time .I will be back again for sure , definite a must place to check it out if your looking for authentic food . Also a must try would be the lemon grass (Shrimp Soup) is amazing.

I think environment plays a role in the experience and this just isn't a good one...it's not somewhere I'd ever take someone or anything like that... I like \"dives\" but this isn't one I'd put in the like category. That being said, the food was pretty good. I got the basil rolls and they are good and huge! I also got the Pho that has meatballs and beef. The side things that came out (basil, cilantro, bean sprouts) did look very clean and fresh. The Pho was good, but the texture of the meatball was a little weird to me. The prices were fine, about what you'd expect at most places (but those others tend to be a bit nicer environment). The service was fine, not bad, not great. There were more dirty tables waiting to be bused in there than clean ones which isn't all that appealing. So, overall, I would maybe get stuff to go from here if I was in that area, but I didn't think it was worthy of more than 3 stars... but I think that's largely the environment."}, {"review_id": "2qQjMyC1yr5Me_aHIwuKJQ", "user_id": "4wyxgx1EuelecO8aP_jCIg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "First time trying this place, I live 20ish minutes away and ordered to go once I arrived.

Husband ordered the Beef Pho and he loved it. I ordered some kind of pork dish. It was also good. Loved the wings for appetizers too. The only issue we had was that they did not let us know ahead of time that they were charging us extra fir party of 6 or more. The waitress ended up getting a 38% tip from all of us. We didn't realize after one of the couples looked at their bill when they got home.But still we all paid separately and we shouldn't have been charged extra.
