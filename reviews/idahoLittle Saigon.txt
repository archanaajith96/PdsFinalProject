I came here nearly an hour before closing with a party of 18, and the entire restaurant was empty. We were not properly greeted, no smiles, hardly even looked at. We told them since our party was so big and we didn't want to trouble them too much, we could split our party and sit at separate tables. As they started moving the tables together regardless of us saying it wasn't needed, they told us to call beforehand next time we come. Keep in mind, it was not busy at all- NO ONE WAS IN THE RESTAURANT BUT US... we asked them what they said because we couldn't believe they would be so rude. Customer service should always come first and they did not come close to meeting the standard. would not recommend anyone coming here- i don't care if their food is good or not- customer service first!"}, {"review_id": "iwA-JsI0hPuCIOlsO7SL_g", "user_id": "9AbhbPEHefuPPhwmZzM8SA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "I love their pho & Vietnamese coffee.

Simple, outdated decor with average food. Was looking forward to getting a good bowl of Pho based on reviews and fairly busy atmosphere ,but alas was disappointed. The key to good Pho is the quality of the broth before you add any condiments to it-not the case here-was bland and oily. The Cha gio, pork egg rolls lacked enough pork to taste substantial. The crispy honey pork was unflavorful. Attentive service but took a long time to get our dinner. I'm glad Nampa has a Vietnamese option and may be enough when there's a craving. Having lived in California does make me picky though..."}, {"review_id": "CafurhenFJCLFKO1Y3S22g", "user_id": "M2NS_aQbMY2apoYjTlOCng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2016", "text": "My new favorite Vietnamese soup restaurant in Boise ... is in Nampa. A friend recommended Little Saigon, which I had not heard of before. I like pho, but it has become the quintessential Vietnamese food that people are most familiar with. There are many other Vietnamese dishes that are worth exploring, too. In the soup department, I much prefer bun bo Hue. It features a rich broth made from pork and beef bones and also features beef slices, shrimp paste, lemongrass and annatto. Then it's finished tableside with Thai basil leaves, bean sprouts, sliced peppers and a wedge of lime.The best I've had comes from a southeast Portland restaurant that shares the soup's name. They also add cubes of congealed pork blood, which lets you know it's the real deal.My go-to place in Boise used to be Pho Tam on Orchard Street, but it closed last year after failing to bounce back from instances of food poisoning. Still, their version paled in comparison to the Portland version.Little Saigon's bun bo Hue falls in-between. It's a step up from Pho Tam's version and is quite good.The staff is friendly and service is quick. I came in just before noon on a Saturday, with one couple already seated. While I was there, tables filled up quickly. The clientele included young couples, families and a couple of tables of seniors. It made me happy to see such a varied group of people enjoying a cuisine that isn't as well known locally as other Asian cuisines."}, {"review_id": "JNIIrPUND7sqpAkz9H1AUQ", "user_id": "FYMTCNaOuUxZXrOEZ6JPLA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "I'm very disappointed in the customer service of Little Saigon. My family and I are currently in town for unfortunate medical circumstances and we chose Little Saigon as we thought that due to the high ratings on Yelp they would be the best choice to  accommodate our big family. We arrived at the restaurant during business hours well before closing. The restaurant was empty upon arrival. We were not greeted properly (no smiles, welcomes etc.) After being told to wait for our tables, the owner rudely exclaimed that we should have called before coming. Not to mention, as they were setting up, my cousin politely told the owner that it was ok to split up the table. The owner responded with, \"you need to wait so we can set up the table.\" She did not listen to our needs at all. I would never recommend Little Saigon to anyone. Customer experience should always be a top priority."}, {"review_id": "xGja0vgrYtReJ59K57OaoA", "user_id": "NVfjLhmRcZZFBsq_hfOvdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/10/2017", "text": "Everyone talks about the Pho (it's great!) but I've recently been trying out their other entrees.

I have a pho craving about once or twice a month and I needed a place to get my fix. I visited 2 other places in Boise before coming to this place with a co-worker. I like the pho with everything in it including tripe, tendons, steak, and meatballs. I didn't see a combination like that on the menu but the waiter informed me that they can make it any way you like. They call it the Pho Special. I went ahead and ordered it and was very pleased. The flavors were spot on, authentic, and delicious. My co-worker ordered a sweet and sour pork dish and he loved it.. he's been talking about going back for a couple of weeks now so we're going again this week. The prices were very reasonable and service was great. Definitely looking forward to going back to get pho fix again."}, {"review_id": "B1dBW3ezG8bRxOx-OXdr1w", "user_id": "innvj9iyqKarWqW4_aSyew", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/30/2017", "text": "Sign and advertising says it's open Monday through Saturday until 9 PM.
