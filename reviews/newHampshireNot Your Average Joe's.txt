It works as both a date restaurant and a \"fancier\" kid / family spot. It can be busy on weekends all day and night, with the shoppers on this busy street. They take reservations, which always works well for us. The ambiance is nice inside the restaurant. They have a small patio, which is nice in the summer months. The patio is adjacent to the busy road, so there is a lot of traffic noise.Food is good. I've been here 4 or 5 times, but haven't found my favorite entree yet. The pizzas, appetizers and salads are great. They usually have local beers on tap. They have a seasonal local menu, which is always fun. It is a good restaurant in this area of Nashua. I'll be back."}, {"review_id": "X7YRz6nBy1Sk0bnXDWaF9A", "user_id": "ppdWizYp4Rlvu20PTIdwPA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Where do I start. It's your below average Joe's.I used to have one that I went to in Newburyport MA. That location has closed and this one will be going down the same road if they don't figure it out.  This is a beautiful restaurant. Spacious clean looks l something out if one of the home or restaurant improvement shows.  Reclaimed this and that but well done. We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken immediately. It pretty much stopped there.  I ordered the grilled chicken with risotto and spinach.How do you screw up spinach and grilled chicken? The spinach was awful. The chicken was  like a picture out of a magazine. It looked perfect. The chicken if it was in the magazine would have been photoshopped. It tasted like it was frozen prior. Just tough and chewy like an old pair of sneakers. I would have sent it back if the waitress showed up to ask how it was. I was starving and had not eaten all day so I suffered through it .My wife ordered the Waldorf salad. It was missing a couple of ingredients but that was ok.  The chicken was dry and it was soaked with dressing. I mean soaked! If it was school vacation week I would have thought someone took their children to work there and they cooked my meals. Can't even get a salad right. My wife placed it on the side and eventually the waitress appeared and asked if she wanted to take it home.  We informed her it wasn't a good meal. She asked if we wanted anything else and that she would ask the chef about our meals . She removed the salad off the bill. There was no visit by the chef or a manager. I actually would have spoken to the manager if they were willing to speak to a client with a bad meal.Perhaps the manager and chef were off today.  All I know is the area is packed with choices. You would be better off trying any of them first.They have been in contact and offered to try to make things right.  I declined do to the fact it is approximately 100 miles round trip for me . Instead I suggested an incentive program to them for the most improved or top staff member. I asked them to let me know they stated they like the idea and will let me know.  It's not the money it's the experience!"}, {"review_id": "DXaEyGF9KF5eWTMI46JRFw", "user_id": "APiU-90112ZfbLhwnqOXIg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "3 stars only because the entree I originally ordered was horrible- it was baked pasta dish with \"al forno\" in the title. I added chicken to it. The dish came out lukewarm, with the chicken on top cold and clearly just thrown on- not mixed in at all. I had a few bites and just couldn't eat it. The cream sauce was non-existent. Fresh mozzarella on top? That's what the menu said, but it was nowhere to be found. Our amazing waitress kindly took it back, apologized, and expedited my replacement- the Mona Lisa salad. The salad was phenomenal! I would return just to order it again. Parmesan crusted chicken, fresh mozzarella, and an amazing creamy basil dressing. Our waitress (I wish I remembered her name) was so sweet, funny, and understanding. She made what could have been a very unpleasant experience great. The other people I dined with really liked their entrees, so I'm going to assume I just made a bad choice with the pasta dish. I would definitely come back and order that salad again- or something else from the menu. Just not a pasta dish :)"}, {"review_id": "KIyz8gHfQ3imrB_b_r_YGA", "user_id": "FFcIjSeyaKiJkjSv7SDhsg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/14/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Just went back for takeout again today, I got the spaghetti squash mushroom bolognese, not much flavor to it but it's not bad. I'm adding some extra stars because of the wonderful customer service. Unfortunately I do not remember her name but the hostess who took my order was a sweetheart, my phone call failed twice while I was trying to order (super annoying!) and she was so sweet about it and not at all annoyed. I had a few special requests on my order (extra gluten free bread-- of course!!) and a non-dairy option for my entree and she was super accommodating, looking up the ingredients and making the correct adjustments. I understand how annoying special requests can be but she made it so simple over the phone! Overall, the food is okay, not really worth the price.. however the staff are amazing !"}, {"review_id": "sExW2xHWym4ewvQAli1Anw", "user_id": "dTa6D4sNv75sesxJGnJWqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Love the bread and dipping oil.

We arrived on a busy Saturday evening, but were seated promptly and the speed of service was excellent.Few notes on the meal - Joe's currently has a Summer BBQ menu in place and I decided to go with the BBQ meatloaf, which was excellent. I love meatloaf, and I am hard pressed to find a place that does it better than Joe's. I'm not sure what exactly is different about the BBQ meatloaf versus the regular menu one, but it was super flavorful, the Gouda cheese was perfectly integrated into the meat, and the side mashed potatoes and gravy were excellent. I did also get the mac n cheese as the second side, which was bland, but not a deal breaker by any stretch. My wife ordered a standard personal pepperoni stone hearth pizza, which was good too.Our waitress Lorien was great, super friendly and attentive to our table. We'll be putting Joe's back into our dining rotation.Disclaimer: an employee from corporate reached out to offer an apology and a gift card for reimbursement for one of our previous meals based on my previous review. We used the gift card tonight, but this did not affect my review in a positive or negative way."}, {"review_id": "KPRLGZVpiPPaplLFj9HUTw", "user_id": "UPcBLKr16rwm5nm6WEe1RA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "So where do I begin? I normally do not write reviews but after this very interesting dining experience and absolutely no contact from management it feels necessary. So we have dined at Not your Average Joes many times, and all four in our party have enjoyed it in the past. We went in on Saturday 4/28 for dinner and had a reservation. We could either wait to sit inside or we could be sat immediately outside. It was still warm out, and our husbands said let's do outdoor seating my sister warned when you are outside you are always forgotten and mistreated which we probably should have listened to her. We were seated and waited about 10-15 minutes to order while the server went to other tables including those who were seated after us, but luckily we were not in a rush. We finally ordered some cocktails and my brother in law requested a glass of coke in addition to his  cocktail, and we ordered an app. A few minutes goes by and our app comes out with a girl who was not our server she tipped the plate as she served it and the steak and cheese egg rolls slid over the side of the plate and one landed on the table. she said oh well I'm really busy and ran away. I picked up the food and was like whatever I guess we will just eat dirty food. The cocktails were also served and my brother in law did not get his coke so he requested again. At this point we went to order dinner, we tried to take advantage of the scratch kitchen by trying to adjust dishes to my taste and my brother in laws taste, we found out that scratch kitchen is a loose interpretation and the enchiladas are made that morning and therefore not customizable (funny part the comment that any dish can be customized is literally right ext to the enchiladas on the menu!!!) Please I have worked for a restaurant group, if you are not truly a scratch kitchen or some dishes are exceptions your menu should note that! In addition your server's extra dose of attitude while addressing this doesn't exactly add to the experience, he was downright rude. so we order and my husband orders the pecan sage pesto salmon, and asked for the side of brussel sprouts to be swapped with the farro risotto, no big deal. Our dinner comes served by a food runner and not our server and I immediately see my husband's plate with a bland piece of salmon and no sage pesto or nuts or anything flavorful, but the sides of mashed sweet potatoes. I quickly realized they must have given him the simply grilled salmon and not the very flavorful one he actually ordered. He tells the runner that the salmon is incorrect, he takes it back. We start eating while my husband waits, also for the record my brother in law's coke still had not appeared this ENTIRE meal. The server also hasn't checke din on our meals either. The food runner gets back and he serves down the plate or salmon now correct, but the sides are wrong the instead of the farro risotto my husband ordered and got the first time it was replaced with the brussel sprouts which is probably the only vegetable my husband will not eat. The runner apologizes and the server finally comes over and they offer to bring out risotto but at this point we are so exasperated my husband just tells them it is fine, but can our brother in law just get the coke he ordered 45 minutes ago. The server gives more attitude and says sure no big deal, well if it was no big deal it would have been served at the beginning of this adventure. Needless to say my husband's meal was comped but no manager ever once checked in on us, I suspect the server didn't share with management our disappointing experience. Between having food thrown at us, getting forgotten, told that your scratch kitchen is not fully scratch, and getting the same meal wrong twice it was a comical experience. We expected better."}, {"review_id": "bdQkd4632daCptPSka7ztQ", "user_id": "bg3DidSA5-qPzBc3-jsT_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This was my first time here and not disappointed at all.

The decor is very industrial-modern, which is one of my favorites. This is a place you can wear anything from jeans or shorts all the way to cocktail attire to. There is a good selection of beers on tap (15+ ish) from local to nationwide craft, to your regular Bud Light. They even have happy hour and specials on food and drinks throughout the week.The patio is very nice- not huge but big enough to not feel cramped. Even though it's right off the main road, you don't really notice the traffic. There are umbrellas for shade on warmer days and a little corner where they have a fire pit with seats at round it.The food menu is huge! There is a seasonal section, then everything from salads and burgers to fish and pasta plates. Some options were great for those safe eaters and then there were some very unique and delicious options. For example I had a veggie burger in which the party was made with quinoa, sweet potato, mushrooms and black beans. It was topped with guacamole and pickled cabbage. Very unique and not normally what I'd pick, but it was filling and satisfying. Definitely a place to check out and the portions are very reasonable."}, {"review_id": "WHVVW4UVfrmQgSh7czTAMA", "user_id": "KKZ7i63ygjkQdG1hUQhCWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/11/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I returned last night with same group of friends.
