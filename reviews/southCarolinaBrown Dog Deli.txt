We spend the morning at the park, walking by the water and admiring the architecture. The menu was robust! Lots to choose from and we saw they had gluten free bread so it was a win. We asked for a table outside, but the host didn't give us an option to wait just said no and brought us to a booth inside. We were fine not waiting because we were hungry, but bummed we didn't get a wait time option for outside.Either way, we ordered drinks and our server was super sweet. I tried the sweet tea because yes, I've never had it. Quite tasty! As for the meal, there were so many options it was nearly impossible to make a decision so I asked the waitress what were fan faves. We both wanted to try their pulled pork so Dan got the Broad St BBQ on gluten free bread with chips and I got the Pig n' Fig with broccoli salad. Super tender pulled pork and good portion sizes. We were super full from the meal and it held us over until a late dinner. The broccoli salad is a must too - sweet and salty combo, lightly dressed and refreshing pair with a hearty meat sandwich."}, {"review_id": "DiQc7uxgaYDa5du_cZTrCA", "user_id": "TnokU_E5RiaUWTlRy4D-hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Stopped here after touring the Provost and Dungeon.

I am so glad we stopped into the Brown Dog Deli. The food was FABULOUS. My sandwich had duck and gorgeous mix of flavors. Like the best thanksgiving leftover sandwich you ever had on crack but more refined. My husband had a beef sandwich with mac and cheese on the sandwich. It was luscious, cheesy, and the perfect comfort on a bone-chilling day. The she crab soup was just right not to much cream, not too much rue, and great crab flavor. Our side slaw was crunchy and seasoned well.I really cannot say much more than has not been said about this fine establishment but they seem to be doing different takes on deli classics and doing it well. Our server was so kind and the vibes of the place were just right. We want to return here on another visit to Charleston and in a town with the restaurant scene such as this, that is saying something.This is a solid place to stop while you are touring the city and I am sure if I lived in Charleston year round that we would be a regular at this spot."}, {"review_id": "Z3o8m1Sy8Uf_3kD1_WY1yQ", "user_id": "4LYMPX3d1nvTncUqVx4xhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "I seriously love this place! We walked across town with an empty stomach to come dine at this fine establishment. We did not factor in the wait into our decision but I will say that the food did not disappoint. I will always recommend this place to everyone who rolls through Charleston. By far, one of the best sandwhiches and hot dogs in town. Needless to say, we devoured our food and had not time for pictures. Alas, we will come again and I will take a moment to post a pic of the scrumptious food! Protip - get the broccli salad, it is literally soooo good!"}, {"review_id": "HOt0ZEXOrCxO39RuVjTxTg", "user_id": "SJHgDIkKueRnVxlPA1d2-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Love this cozy little restaurant in Downtown Charleston! I'm in love with the blue walls and wall decor of musicians and memorabilia. It has a back patio for outdoor seating which is really nicely decorated by plants and the best part, it's pet friendly!Service was very friendly and our food was out fast even for a big crowd that we had.I ordered the Pig N Fig with a side of broccoli salad, and I am so glad I did! The Pig N Fig has pulled pork, fig rosemary preserves, applewood smoked bacon, Granny Smith apples and cheddar cheese on a pressed French baguette and it was just heaven! I loved the broccoli salad it was the perfect combination of sweet from the dressing and salty from the bacon!There's a good beer selection and price is just right! I'm not a vegan but a few people in my crowd were and they raved over their Vegan menu especially the Vegan Chili Dogs and Mock Chicken Gyro.Really a chill place to eat and have a drink, eat here! :)"}, {"review_id": "CV79OIHJmVHJBnz3egcJBA", "user_id": "-CPiorgq-AQlOIlfZzLKXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "When in the Charleston area we must have lunch at the Brown Dog Deli.

We found this local spot while walking around one sunny Sunday and we plan to be regulars. Located in a beautiful old building on Broad street, the setting and the cuisine are both super! If you work in downtown Charlestown or if you are visiting, take some time to visit Brown Dog.We had 3 different salads - chipotle, salmon + watermelon, and Greek. All were generous portions and were delicious. The dressings were yummy and served on the side - all of us had to ask for extra, so maybe request that up front. There is menu for children, too + they offer crayons and a coloring menu.Beers are available on tap, including some from local breweries. There is booth and table seating and a patio out back. The sandwiches and hot dogs look amazing on the menu - we will have to return to sample those.Try this place and enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "U1IsOzT4ut57CB745sTMxw", "user_id": "S12DAZzJd3zhktPpEVwdwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "The perfect local lunch spot to stop at when you're exploring Charleston!

We felt like a break from the typical Southern/BBQ place and wanted some sandwiches for lunch before our history tour. Â We arrived and took a seat outside in the pretty little courtyard area. We were greeted promptly and ordered a sandwich to share, as we weren't extremely hungry. We shared the Southern, which was pulled pork, sausage, fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese all served on a fresh, soft bun. (guess we ended up having Southern food after all). But we figured since we WERE in Charleston, Southern food is the way to go. Let me just say;the sandwich was phenomenal. One of THE BEST I've ever had. It was true sandwich perfection. A Pimento Cheese Dog was also ordered(of which I only took one bite),which had mustard,onion and pimiento cheese. It was also super tasty. The menu is fairly large and they have many,many other sandwiches,etc with cool sounding names that we would have loved to have tried, so guess we'll just have to return to sample some more!"}, {"review_id": "qHiKO0-AaRNt1nqtYieSxw", "user_id": "JiXhNSHHv-giP1racU_MwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "Holy cow!!!

Sweet teas all around! They do serve a selection of craft beers but no liquor or wine. The decor is cute and eclectic. We sat on the patio which was warm but nice coming from up North.There's nothing fancy about the presentation of the food but boy did it taste good.If you want a reasonable priced meal in the Historic district its worth the wait!

Â This is a great little local deli that is located right on Broad St. Â Depending on the day they can get pretty busy for lunch but make sure to check out the back patio if it is full inside...and they let you bring your dog to the patio.They serve up all kind of wraps, sandwiches, burgers & hot dogs. Â They also have soups and salads with a few specials that change every day. Â I normally call in my order...but be prepared to try a few times as the line is busy A LOT...so I think they use ChowNow for online orders too. Food is always delicious. Â Exactly what you would expect for a little deli like this. Â The amount of food for what you pay is appropriate and I would often find myself ordering lunch from here 2-3 times a week. Â They even serve a few beers for you tourists drinking at lunch.Stop in and enjoy one of your deli favorites...you won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "3OCB_4dDi0HOcgPuEKTF1w", "user_id": "4Knod97d_qMtBxRYjptwPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Get here before the lunch rush, 11am or 11:30am to secure a table.

Lots of 80s and 90s regalia. I got there at 5 pm and they had ran out of the short rib, which was key for the big mac and the short rib grilled cheese sandwiches that were at the top of my wish list. I got the French onion grilled cheese instead but regretted it. It had such a small thin amount of meat, that I immediately started to eat the hot dog instead. I hope this is not the norm. The au jus was great, though, and the cheese was delicious. I wasn't trying to eat just a grilled cheese sandwich though. The fig sandwich with pulled pork, on the other hand, had a generous amount of pork. It was also a good balance of sweet and savory and the bread was toasted nicely. Finally, the hot dog. Nothing special about the pimento cheese and mustard dog. To be frank, it was kind of like having a ballpark dog with melted cheese, mustard, and onion. One of the tips stated that this was the best hot dog someone had ever had, but I will assure you that you should try a different hot dog here to have that experience. The other options did look intriguing and delicious.Â Service was quick and efficient without any hiccups. All in all, a decent spot to grab a lunch, but a couple things held it back from being great in my book. Maybe if I get the short rib next time, I will change my mind."}, {"review_id": "UiSrz0Rla0ukKBDo_s_I8g", "user_id": "ECEIWrwU9TtjSbLIfz9X3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Great deli!
