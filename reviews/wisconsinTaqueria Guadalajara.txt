The pastor was really bland.  In my opinion,  if I have to add avocado, a ton of lime,  etc. to the taco to make it taste halfway decent, it's probably not a good taco. The lengua taco was eh. I've had good lengua before,  and this had an old beef taste-- like it sat in the fridge thawing too long before it was cooked kind of taste. I ended up just scooping up beans and rice with chips and left my tacos to be tossed. I expected better,  since they had a couple best of Madison framed certificates up on the wall. Sadly,  I probably won't be returning to try anything else. If the tacos are blah,  I can't see the more complex dishes being much better."}, {"review_id": "KAP78GSrvo7GXQKJP4wxiA", "user_id": "KViAfL75-D4FLdH9OUcuPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "This is generally a really good spot for some Mexican food. The only reason that I'm not giving 5 stars is because there have been a few times where the food has not been as good. I mostly chalk this up to off days as for the most part it is delicious. I also think I usually have better luck with steak dishes as opposed to chicken ones. For the weekend, they have a delicious menudo and breakfast options (all day I think?).The restaurant is often packed but we've never had to wait more than 15 minutes. Service is fast and efficient with unlimited chips and salsa. Prices are also very affordable."}, {"review_id": "vFY788bgMi_hsj4OgtxH_A", "user_id": "0IknfAj4nG_JZ8JiGSCzUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "We tried the cactus dish, burrito and quesadillas.

Small seating area but quick service. Bathrooms were very clean. Salsa is a little thin but tastes good. Could have used a second basket of chips. Tacos come wrapped in 2 corn tortillas.UPDATE: Then next time we went they were on top of refilling chips and salsa and even brought a hot salsa which was true to its name but delicious. Ordered Nachos Mexicanos, no meat but added veggies. Tasty and a huge portion. Wish they put queso on them instead of just melted cheese though."}, {"review_id": "8m-3DkRpCpMFT72c8YL_vg", "user_id": "z1RZ4xLMfzwRlAnN3toSfA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Tried this place out over the weekend definitely was not what I expected,ordered a variety of tacos and all the meats seemed bland to me especially the pastor,after waiting for my tacos they happened to still come out cold.They gave me a small portion of chips and salsa to start with and didn't offer to refill.

Their enchiladas are great. The rice and beans are good too. Service is pretty attentive. I haven't tried other menu items.

Granted, my boyfriend I have lived in San Diego, El Paso, and Las Vegas and perhaps the bar is a bit higher there for what qualifies as decent Mexican food. This **hands down** was some of the worst Mexican food I have ever had. To the point that I ate a tiny bit of my meal and didn't want to take any home to relive that horrible experience. My boyfriend and I got the enchiladas de mole, chile relleno, carne el pastor tacos, and a gordita.First, the enchiladas de mole. OK. Mole sauce is the crown jewel of Mexican food. Maybe this was too hard a test for the first encounter. But the \"mole\" tasted like it was the mole sauce from a jar mixed with canned enchilada sauce. There was absolutely nothing interesting about it, no dimension, no spices (not hot, I mean spices), nothing. And it tasted processed, as does the sauces from a can or jar. The chile relleno was mournful, soggy, and flavorless. That is what my boyfriend got, I tried a bite, and that was it. Hell. No.The tacos were good. Not great, just good. They don't make their own tortillas, and I don't particularly expect them to, but they were low quality and you could taste the dough conditioners and preservatives in them.I didn't even bother to try the gordita, and I hope to never, ever, ever try the gordita, or anything else from this place ever again.*****shudder*****"}, {"review_id": "fRhRKxaY48tAas-Y0OpvgA", "user_id": "oeGpqfn-EBLjtEv1Tw1DtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Local local local.

Looks like you're going into someone's house then boom, a whole entire restaurant. The dining room is very bright with its windows. You can tell that it's been renovated. It had a modern feel to it.The food was amazing. My measure of a Mexican restaurant is how they do Enchiladas verdes. They hit way above the mark into orbit here. I demolished everything on that plate. The NegativesUnderstaffed: Their dining room was filled to capacity (each table was full) with only one server. This sucked/was awesome for her but our service was not what it could have been had they have anticipated our rush. It took at least 10 minutes for us to get started with water, chips, and salsa. We were barely able to get water refills in the course of meal. They do not do tap fountain drinks. You can order beer or a soft drink in a can. That's it. I really hated that. That alone is a big deterrent from coming back.All in all, if I knew the service were gonna be like that every time, I'd never come again. I'd recommend going when not many people are there for the best service. I liked it there--I just wish they had more than one server working at the time."}, {"review_id": "G9IhIqO8xE3Ta66mYfz2sg", "user_id": "QUBTrQd_KvLapNYjo8FrFw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/11/2017", "text": "Always enjoy an afternoon meal here.

Their service is surprisingly good for having such few staff. Those few staff are working their butts off though, boy howdy. If you know you'll want extra salsa, tell that to your server right when they give your table the first batch of chips and salsa. They always customize my weird requests like subbing out meat for an extra egg, instead of sunny side up, wanting scrambled, and getting the hot sauce on the side (confession: I'm a \"dipper,\" I'd prefer to dip my food into sauce rather than have it spread on my dish). Come here if you want a delicious, legit Mexican-style dish and are willing to wait a little bit extra while you sip on coffee or a real sugar cane Coke and eat chips and salsa.

We were told it would be a 5 minute wait and we're sat in a timely manner. The server was nice enough to give me a sample of the horchata (which is absolutely delicious). After this, she disappeared for about 10 minutes before taking our order. When the food arrived, my cousins order was wrong (she had asked for the dish without beans). We attempted several times to get our servers attention with no luck. My cousin ended up just eating around them (luckily they weren't mixed in the meal). While we were eating, another server put her tray down on our table to deliver drinks to the table next to us. This is not only off-putting, but also unprofessional. Food was fine, only standout was the horchata.

That being said I love this place and would like to support it's fantastic food and service in any fashion possible.I've said it in other reviews, unfortunately there isn't a depth in diversity of dining in Madison. This is one place that helps solve this issue. Taqueria Guadalajara offers authentic Mexican food in a laid back atmosphere and with warm, friendly service.As many reviewers have already elaborated, this place is packed at peak times. Luckily service is so fast that waiting doesn't exceed past twenty minutes per party.When I do go here, I have a tendency to order the same thing over and over again, the steak chimichanga.  I see a lot of people order variety though, including a various assortment of foods with Verde sauce, breakfast, etc... All food is made fresh and to order. This is a point of distinction between this taqueria and others in Madison. A clear example is that the steak is made for burritos, tacos, etc. in small batches to satisfy the orders needing steak. At other places, the steak will be made every few hours and will be allowed to sit around. This makes all the difference in taste of freshness and providing restaurant quality. The produce is also prepared in fresh as well every few hours. The tastes are very reflective of going to a classic place in Mexico and asking for a particular food.The price, friendly staff, and great quality simply has no rival in Madison.Oh and they also have Mexican cokes, horchata, Jarritos, and a few beers for selection - a nice touch."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-guadalajara-madison?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
