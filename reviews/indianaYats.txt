And by fast, I mean FAST. I went there today to order chili cheese etouffee with crawfish to-go (my absolute favorite). I walked in, ordered, glance at the posters on the wall, turned around, and my order was ready--the entire thing took less than 3 minutes, I'm not exaggerating! (I barely even had to time to check in, that's how fast my food came out). I love Yats because not only is it cheap (around $8 for an order) but it's so flavorful and FILLING. Perfect for a college student like myself!I highly recommend Yats to anyone, but especially if you're hungry and want something quick."}, {"review_id": "y_fVV2ykH9s1kMRLzjilww", "user_id": "79ac1iJiHRT0jqn16lNMGQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Not exactly what I hoped for. We were on a nice walk through the neighborhood, and finally decided to see what the hype was about. I've heard that Yats was amazing from quite a few folks. My experience wasn't that. I found it to be okay. Not great, not awful, not exactly what I expected.I just returned from New Orleans a few days ago and still had the creole bug. I wanted a little more. Thinking that this could do it; it didn't. I ordered the red beans and rice and white chicken chili. The rice was great, but the red beans and sausage and white chicken chili was dry. Also, they tasted the same. My GF ordered the drunk chicken and it looked just like the other dishes. I was just surprised to taste quality of the food when the place boasts being Cajun/Creole. I think the dryness is directly correlated to the food coming out before we walked to the table. I would guess that it was under a heat lamp or sitting out for a while. Either way, not a bad place, just not for me."}, {"review_id": "vFD8tjvYVp6G3VRhiVjCUg", "user_id": "8TxlUss9Y9Yo3jGTyc81pQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "So...I did not really enjoy Yats. We happened upon it during a walk and decided to check it out. I've read so many great reviews so, why not.  I'd been hesitant because every photo looked like Ethiopian food. That's not a bad thing...just not what I expected from a \"Creole & Cajun Inspired\" restaurant. Cajun and Creole-ish. At best. Maybe I've spent too much time in the mecca of Cajun food, New Orleans, eating the absolute best Creole and Cajun food of my life...so, my opinion is skewed. I didn't find the food to be very flavorful and we had three dishes. Different dishes on different plates and somehow they tasted very much the same.  The rice was cooked to perfection though! It was very affordable and honestly came out of the kitchen by the time I received my change. Quick service, but it lets me know that it's just sitting in a pot or under a heat lamp waiting for the next customer.  Not really what I expected. This was just not what I expected from a restaurant that advertised Creole and Cajun food."}, {"review_id": "kD7K8xgA-hDpdFac61b3qg", "user_id": "veRNLv6_8QSJXFnKwQaexw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Good for vegetarians and not. Consistently great food in an informal atmosphere. Specializes in genuinely good, spice-it-yourself (many many many spices available) Cajun food. Each dish is served over rice, and comes with bread. Soft drinks available. I've been coming here for decades and can't think of why I've never reviewed it here.Each batch is consistent. This is home-cooked food (they make it more or less from scratch in the kitchen every day), and is pretty flavorful. Downsides: no fresh salads or veggies; somewhat limited seating; counter-driven but delivered within a couple minutes of your order or less; not formal dining; no major culinary advances.Upsides: inexpensive, very tasty, consistent, friendly, cafe atmosphere, patient staff, reasonable prices, great for carry out.

I'm shocked that I haven't reviewed yet. There was a place similar to this when I was in college and when I first moved to Indianapolis I was so happy to find there is a spot that still can make me have so much joy in food! First off, I love the decor and the staff here. They're very cool and casual and they just love that patrons have a great experience. My last visit here was last week for Mardi Gras! They were even giving out free slices of King Cake! One of my favorite items is the B&B because of the sweet and spicy sauce they cook it in but obviously I had to come get some crawfish so the awesomeness here is that you can get a half and half order! Chili Cheese Etoufee with Crawfish and B&B atop warm rice and two pieces of baguette later, this girl was a happy camper!"}, {"review_id": "os2zCb5tbola7REKARoYyQ", "user_id": "r0PIAIRRsaxpF7z9SRCT1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I have never had Creole style food and if my friend hadn't driven me here and recommended it so highly I probably wouldn't have given it a shot.

But even when it does spill, I'm not ashamed to say I've scraped it from the bag. Everything I've had from Yats is just so delicious. One of my favorite parts of ordering is that you can get 1/2 an order of two dishes, thus maximizing your ordering potential. I generally do 1/2 a dish with meat and 1/2 of a vegetarian option. Some of my faves are B&B (a slightly sweet black bean and corn creation), Drunk Chicken (chicken with a slightly spicy sauce), and the Chili Cheese Ettouffe. Best of all, all the portions are generous and are served with a genuine smile and a nice hunk of bread. The food is simple, but the recipes are honed to perfection. I'm so glad one of these gems is in our neighborhood."}, {"review_id": "JiaJjzr_-tLDGE_ii3UYjQ", "user_id": "bXr4ieQoben3YZHlUlcFLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Love this location.

With my parents living in Houston, I often crave good Cajun/Creole food and I can't believe I haven't found this place until now!! The food is incredibly cheap and absolutely delicious. The service is so quick and so friendly. The person taking our order let us sample the different dishes we wanted to try to make sure we actually liked the food. There are also vegan/vegetarian options so that's a bonus! The half and half is only $8 and the amount of food you get is ridiculous! We ended up getting a half portion of jambalaya and a half & half of crawfish etoufee and drunken chicken with extra bread. The jambalaya, etoufee, and drunken chicken were so flavorful and the two latter ones are served on a bed of rice. The bread is AMAZING - they use a spiced butter and it's unbelievable. A lot of the reviews say it's cash only but they accepted card when I went so perhaps they've updated their system! I will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "_bK4Dy5V8KSGnHhAQdENBA", "user_id": "xrxWNeEhu5Qz9rOAea2I1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/14/2017", "text": "It seems like since we landed in Indy, everyone was telling us that we had to hit Yats. Also, everyone called out the chili cheese etouffee.. it wasn't originally on our list of to-dos, but we quickly figured out this place was an Indy must do according to all the locals who seemed to know their stuff.  There are several locations, but we unintentionally hit the original Yats as our last meal before leaving town. We were happy to hear that it was the original.We knew we wanted the chili cheese etoufee, but had no idea what else we wanted. Fortunately the lady taking our order let us sample some of the other dishes. We ended up also ordering a half and half of the white chicken chili and drunken chicken. Both were good... not nearly as good as the chili cheese etouffee though. I had really been craving crawfish so this was perfect.. and it had a lot of crawfish too! Soo good! I should also mention that our food beat us to the table. We were so thrilled about this because we had a terrible experience for brunch as far as waiting goes, and we wanted to hit another brewery before the flight home if we had time. We did! Thanks Yats!We had also heard that they were cash only.. this actually was not the case so we got to pay with card. Apparently they had been in the past, but this was a fairly new thing. If we ever find ourselves in the area again.. we will definitely be hitting Yats up! Pro tip.. apparently you can substitute quinoa for the rice that the dishes come on top of. One of the guys who recommended Yats to us was very adamant about this! They were out of quinoa when we were there, but we didn't really care.

I loooove creole food. Love, love, love it. I went to New Orleans about 6 years ago and have dreamed about the food ever since. When I stepped into Yats for the first time, those dreams became reality once again. Yats is basically having a mini New Orleans right here in Indy. I have had many of their dishes, but the drunken chicken is my forever favorite. Yats is quick, easy, and staff is always friendly. Takeout is convenient, but I feel like you get larger portion sizes when you eat in, so I'd recommend doing that while you look at all the New Orleans decor on the walls. Even if you think you don't like creole food, you need to stop in at Yats.
