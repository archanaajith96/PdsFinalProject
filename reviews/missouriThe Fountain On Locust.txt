The Chicken Tortilla Soup was outstanding! I had the Fountain Cuban half sandwich and my daughter had the Royal Grill with Turkey. Both were VERY good! The Royal Grill is Adult Grilled Cheese with apple and was so good but very rich. The Cuban was DELICIOUS!! We had an a la cart brownie for dessert and it was ooey gooey, fantastic! Our server Maddie was PHENOMENAL! She was funny, attentive and thoughtful! Her suggestions were spot on!"}, {"review_id": "ox0utyHkggAdcoYzTV1_LQ", "user_id": "c6eOjVd8ODoUG9dGqcP8-w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Guess what? Before seeing Chicago my family I went somewhere else. Good thing since the Owner decided to private message me and ask me why I keep coming to her establishment. Great customer service.I responded and told her that I come back because the menu has other things to try that I may like. Seems odd logic to write off a restaurant after two visits because you personally didn't enjoy what you ordered. However, smart logic would be to tell everyone that Joy is a condescending owner who berates her costumers if they dislike their meal. Lovely reason to never come back."}, {"review_id": "jkuFD-nlPOGOexFQrOW94w", "user_id": "MUCPg2lTlLA8eYe1ZnoNcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "The kids and I walked up from Chaifetz on a rainy Saturday between gymnastics sessions.  I checked in on yelp while we were walking and I'm really glad I did because we were seated immediately.  But we must have beaten everyone else there because just after we were seated the crowd hit.  Due to the influx of diners, our table got a little bit lost in the shuffle and some of the later arrivals were greeted and had their orders taken before us.  However, our server apologized for the delay and he was super friendly and helpful.My kids chose Mac and cheese (which I typically discourage because it's often kraft and my kid never likes it and it is money wasted...but I digress) and say cheese, which is basically a cheese pizza on focaccia.  I chose the pesto chicken with a side of St. Louis city salad.  This was one meal that we all really enjoyed and I heard zero complaints!  The Mac and cheese was not from a box and kiddo #1 devoured it with the intermittent \"this is really good.\"  Kiddo #2 did not eat all of the say cheese but also said it was good.  The biggest excitement for them was the potato sticks, which they both loved and commented on.  I guess I've never introduced them to the canisters of potato sticks found at the grocery store.My St. Louis city salad was super good (I might even try it as my sandwich next time).  The chicken pesto was open face on focaccia.  While I t was good, I doubt I'll order it again (but Kiddo #1 might as she finished off the rest of my pesto chicken while declaring her love for pesto).What we really came here for was dessert.  By checking in on yelp, I received a free world's smallest ice cream cone (I chose coconut almond joy).  I also ordered a world's smallest hot fudge sundae.  Kid #1 chose a stutz sundae with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup.  Kid #2 wanted dipping dots (?!) back at Chaifetz but I still let her get a world's smallest cone with chocolate ice cream.  Yummo!  Loved their ice cream and I really loved the small desserts.  Just the right amount to get a taste but not feel over indulgent.  We will definitely be back and next time I want to try a house made soda."}, {"review_id": "EzP0roOW7Z_Vg_nPkw6IGQ", "user_id": "qRAa26gfUMsZ-xYWgnYWTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Wonderful spot- location is perfect, staff was great.

The sundaes here are delicious! You can mix em up as you wish or you can go for the specials on the menu. I tried the Nutty Espresso. For 5.99$, the sundae is a steal. If you are not in the mood to indulge, they serve baby sized sundaes for 2$. Either way they are all about generous portions, great taste and happy customers.

In the last couple of months I have rectified that error. The Fountain has a nice mixture of soups and sandwiches that I have enjoyed. It seems odd, but the dill soup (really a potato soup) is really good. I actually had a dream about it and made my wife go back to the Fountain this past weekend. Really though the stand out at the Fountain are the treats. Shakes, sundaes, and homemade sodas are a real treat. The Fountain on Locust isn't too far from both the Fox and the Symphony. It works as a light meal before the show, or as a destination once the performance is over."}, {"review_id": "KdiVBtRXfHMuTGOGvZlf-g", "user_id": "ChDCv9FBVFS-HVR1UOHyCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Such a retro feel, and a relaxed atmosphere!

Metered street parking is available. My husband and I got chocolate malts but there wasn't enough malted milk powder in it. It tasted like a regular shake. They also have a half and half on their menu for soup, salad and sandwich. My daughter saw dill pickle soup on the menu and she flipped. Her idea of heaven will be pickles all over the place. The soup is really a potato soup with dill and it is delicious. We all scraped our bowls clean. My sandwich was their adult grilled cheese.  Two types of cheese with sliced apples on wheat bread. The apples really pulled the sandwich together. Everyone else loved what they ordered (I know my husband got the Cuban) and they were eaten quickly. Would I come back here?  Yes, more dill pickle soup please. I'll catch you on the flip side."}, {"review_id": "DNnqqXbXkjjnC9kEO5uwzw", "user_id": "I1KdeHqBQXQHQkdfFCrG7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "This place was aMaZing !

Its rare that one place can do all three well, but they have it down. It was busy two days after Christmas and the hostess was working hard to keep everyone happy and the large parties together. It's super kid friendly, despite not having a kids menu. The worlds smallest ice cream cones and miniature sundaes were popular with all of us 8 and under and 30+. Sharing a meatball sub and customizing the adult grilled cheese left our kiddos happy. The StLouis salad with the pesto grilled chicken was a 5 star selection. Tasted the tomato bisque--awesome. The dill pickle soup is interesting. You have to like pickles and potatoes to enjoy this unique soup. Andrew was our server and he was SUPER on all levels. Great experience.

I try to take all my out of town family and friends here. They achieve a nice balance of standard American food, blended with many unique food items that are specific to the style and ideas of Fountain on Locust. For example- they have pickle soup! Not a lot of options if you are aVegetarian, but I am, and always make do. My go-to items are the tomato soup, grilled cheese, Sutz Salad, and the veggie focaccia sandwich. The Basil Faulty cocktail is also another special menu item, IMO. Cost is reasonable, usually not a wait, and generally open street parking unless there is a concert or basketball game at Chaifetz.I will always frequent Fountain on Locust as one of the favorite local spots."}, {"review_id": "qvRnIL0RccOkNqGwvqORzQ", "user_id": "P-T8Mqp5Hk9u6tmqRWuiJw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2017", "text": "We have a sweet tooth and gave this place a try after visiting the science center.  Wow the decor in this place is off the wall.  Very eclectic and unique.  They have a ton of choices.  I got the nutty americano which is espresso bean ice cream with hot fudge and butter pecan.  Very rich and smooth.  My wife got the Italian orange which was also very flavorful.  My son got the chocolate brownie in a cup.  I redeemed my Yelp for free worlds smallest ice cream come.  So so funny.  You gotta see theSize on this thing.  All in all, lots of different varieties and they have savory dishes as well.  Definitely worth coming back if we are ever in the St. Louis area.  They do not have free parking, so we just paid meter on the street.  Highly recommended."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-fountain-on-locust-saint-louis-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
