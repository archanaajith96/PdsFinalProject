My brothers and I were so excited to eat here. We came around 12pm and the place was already pretty full. We ordered a pie for the table that was half margherita and half white. Of the two, I definitely liked the margherita more! The tomato sauce on it was amazing. The white was good as well but I found the cheese to be a little overwhelming. Overall, the pizza was definitely tasty but I think Lombardi's is a bit too touristy. I would definitely recommend trying more hole in the wall pizza shops around NYC!"}, {"review_id": "ocbgjPYFyzCPUrgQvnw5dA", "user_id": "bjIlPbH8aDChmGZmZp__HQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "CASH ONLY. Just an okay place for me based off their clam pizza.  Food:-bruschetta: 2 pieces of toasted bread with bruschetta. Pretty decent with lots of bruschetta but I wasnt wowwed or anything. I actually didn't see nor taste any cheese on it. -clam pizza (~$35): Honestly expected more. Yes they stack the pizza with tons of clams, but was missing that extra kick for me. Tasted like clams on bread with some skimpy cheese. I understand that this would further emphasize the clam flavor, but it just tasted  bland. For $35 for an 8 slice pie, I don't think it was worth. -Brooklyn lager draft is $28 a pitcher Service:Friendly host, decently friendly server. Didn't check up on us but was fast at refilling waters and picking up plates. Ambiance:Casual Italian feel with a ton of pictures on the wall. Also has a bar if you just want to come for drinks."}, {"review_id": "hR2zPmFeh8EF5JQHdKxVAQ", "user_id": "o4J6kxGIP7FCxAyKbH4ZQg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This pizza is INCREDIBLE! I'll tell you why I give this place 3 stars. First, this pizza is delectable. Amazing. Love it. Why did 3 sodas, 2 beers, and a medium-sized pizza pie cost $65-$80? How much are you paying your employees? Prove to me you're paying them a living wage while you charge this much for only several items. Until then, I probably (and sadly, because I truly love this pizza) won't return to your restaurant. Prove a living wage to me first.

I ordered the white pizza because I always have to have ricotta on my pizza. I added garlic spinach to it and that was all it needed! I also ordered a blood orange spritzer; it was okay. The Italian soda with whipped cream wasn't that great either. S E R V I C E:Excellent. It was very crowded and we came in with a big group around 9:30pm!

This place has been around FOREVER so I had to check out the hype! But caution -- CASH ONLY. Food: We ordered two pies for 5 people, one small and one large which left us full! We got a classic tomato sauce pizza and a classic white pizza. Personally, I was a bigger fan of the white pizza but others in my group preferred the tomato sauce pizza. Both, I thought were a bit bland though. I think the white pizza sauce could've used maybe some garlic and basil in the sauce and the tomato sauce was more sweet than savory. Cost: CASH ONLY!!!! (which was annoying but they have an ATM, try to hit the bank before you come though to avoid the fees). The prices were very affordable and I thought they were adequate for the amount and quality of the pizza. Service: mehh, not bad but I think they struggle to check up on people with so much going on. But despite being super busy, pizza was out in less than 20 mins! Will I be back? Probably not. It's a cute little pizza place to bring your family or friends but nothing special. Loved the charming style with the picnic style set up (paper plates, checkered linens) but just a one time visit was enough."}, {"review_id": "3VbgMFF89ym0ZD9ewHkxMQ", "user_id": "8yotJzdYmtsaCHIfJhNmCg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "I visited Lombardi's about an hour before closing on a Wednesday night. We were seated right away, but it seems like it'd be a decent wait if you went during peak hours. Also, be warned: this is a cash only place and it's pricey, so prepare accordingly. We ordered two large pizzas for four people: one original margarita with pepperoni and a white pizza with meatballs. We weren't able to finish all of them, but they made for tasty leftovers. I do think that this place is incredibly overpriced as each pizza came out to be over $30, but it is a touristy place, so I guess that's to be expected. In terms of taste they were good, but nothing out of this world. I preferred the white pizza and the ricotta cheese and fresh mozzarella were delicious. I'm not a huge can of thin crusts, but I know that's a draw for a lot of people. I would have liked to order the clam pizza, but it was only available in the large size, which I was moderately disappointed by. We also got some of the raspberry Italian sodas which were incredibly subpar. I'd say that if you're trying to hit all the popular tourist destinations, it's worth the time, but you can definitely get better and cheaper pizza elsewhere in the city if you don't care about the novelty of trying \"New York's Famous Pizza from America's First Pizzeria\"."}, {"review_id": "zQBW9O6DFqGiHFkhnX7ncg", "user_id": "U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Wandering around Little Italy and noticed this is where the crowd was heading for dinner.

It was very good but also very standard. Adam and I were also insanely hungry so we scarfed it down in like 10 minutes.It was a bit expensive for pizza, considering NY is known for cheap as dirt pizza.Although it is famous, it is also touristy and I'm sure this isn't the best place to get pizza.

It was cool to visit a restaurant with so much history, but... you're in New York. There are far better places to go if you're craving pizza.We got the small original margherita pie and large clam pie. The margherita pie's sauce was tasty, but it was all cooked down and drained of moisture. This made the pie very dry and very underwhelming. The dough was also too crunchy. The clam pie was better, with a heaping amount of evenly spread clams, and nice with a squeeze of lemon. But it was again dry and in dire need of sauce.I will say that the iced tea with peach syrup was nice and refreshing. But the cost of the pies is not balanced by the quality in my opinion.

I do not understand the hype. It took about 15 minutes to get a table for two, which wasn't too bad. When we got to the table, the waiter took our order. We ordered a large margherita pizza and just asked for water. He said that the cook time would be about 20 minutes. The plates and cups that they brought were plastic. It literally took 45 minutes from the time we ordered for the pizza to be brought to us. And that is not even the worse part. The cheese was somewhat burnt as was the bread. When biting into it, the pizza was so hard and crunchy, but not the good kind. Honestly, it was nothing special. I do not understand the hype. The pizzerias in New York that have a slice for a dollar tastes better. Would not recommend. This place was obviously the first pizzeria for a reason.

To be honest, I think our pizza was really burnt. You could see the charred black spots of cheese on one side of the pizza and the bottom of was just burnt. The pizza dough offered really no flavor at all...

Yes, yes first pizzeria in the US.  However, not the greatest. One could find better pizza in every direction 5-10 mins walking from Lombardi's. We ordered half margherita and half white.  Toppings tasted great.  Loved the slightly sweet tomato sauce. The slightly charred cheese on the white side of the pizza looked beautiful. But crust was not crispy. The sauce was too wet for the thin crust to absorb well. The crust was pretty much saturated with sauce. Sorry, but when a charred pizza becomes soggy, there was too much sauce. The crust appeared fairly dense, so if the crust was crispy, it wouldve probably been hard.  All in all, the pizza still tasted great. Above any chain or nice pizzeria outside of new york.At $26 for a small pizza was a tad high. And it's not like this is a nicer or a more premium place either. They serve you water and pizza with plastic cups and paper plates.  Even chipotle has nicer cutlery. It's almost like a single slice place but they charge you twice as much because its a sit-down restaurant."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/lombardis-pizza-new-york?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
