As a vegetarian who grew up in the South, Biscuits and Gravy is one of the dishes I really miss, so I was very happy to see a vegetarian version of the dish on the menu at Surrey's!The Biscuits and Mushroom Gravy were so delicious and filling. Rarely do I leave food on my plate, but my friend and I couldn't bring food in to our next stop for the day, and the portions were so huge that I had to leave a few bites on the plate for fear of bursting.Surrey's is home to a great menu selection, huge portions, and delicious food!"}, {"review_id": "p4Fl-tpA6IgAjIB_MOohLA", "user_id": "KJpCTojG8WAXx1fMN2WpWA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Prepare to be SNUBBEDThe staff will alternately ignore and treat you like they are doing you a favor to let you eat there.

Couldn't they have had me sit at a table and have some coffee for 15 minutes? And though they place was empty, I was guided to a table for two instead of a table for four. By \"fresh\" OJ, they mean \"freshly bought\" not \"freshly squeezed.\" I tried to hold out for the promise of shrimp and grits which had been recommended by the hostess where I'm staying, but finally had enough.

Once inside, the place is small with lots of artwork on the walls, most of which is for sale, I believe.We came late morning in the middle of the week, although it is full of customers, there was a table in the back. The excellent and super friendly wait staff was on point during our entire visit.After drinking some coffee and getting a couple of tips from our waiter, I ordered the shrimp 'n grits.  The kitchen was pretty quick getting the orders out. My shrimp 'n grits came covered in a delicious and creamy sauce that is seasoned to near perfection. There are three crispy pieces of bacon around the edge of the bowl with a sprig of a sage plant in the middle.  There is plenty of tender, juicy gulf shrimp sitting on creamy, well-seasoned grits. So rich and flavorful.

I got the banana foster French toast the first time and then the turkey club on rye the second time I came. My boyfriend also got the lox blt, which was sooooo good! Everything tasted so fresh and I only wish I had a place like this by my house! Every time we came it was so hard to choose what we wanted to get. They also have great fresh squeezed juices. You can mix and match various fruits, veggies, and ginger to get the perfect drink for you.

I cant thank her enough for this recommendation. Small store front, staff very friendly. There is usually a wait, probably because the place isn't that big but also because the food is slammin'. Grits are creamy and smooth with lots of flavor. The shrimp are seasoned very well with a great sauce and light bread. The portion is perfect. The shrimp and grits are ranked among top 2 BEST shrimp and grits I'VE had in the country. I'm a big shrimp and grits person. I've had a lot in my day and I dream about these! The banana fosters french toast is also good but the staples here is the SHRIMP AND GRITS. The food comes out fast and try the home made juices. Very good.

Two of my friends went to Surrey's TWICE in a four-day trip just for the shrimp and grits. It was definitely not your average dish. Lined with small toasts around the bowl, infused with bacon bits, and creamy, thick grits with perfectly proportioned shrimp, every bite was truly an experience I did not want to end. I wanted to eat it all up while at the same time savor every last bite. It was extremely filling, but I also tried a bite of the pain perdu, which was divine as well. Bearing in mind the second part of the name, \"juice bar,\" and they are apparently the first juice bar in New Orleans, according to their menu, I wanted to try a juice out myself! I combined apple, carrot & ginger and felt simply refreshed. The ginger is pretty strong. Great to wash down all the food you just consumed!Service was excellent and we experienced friendly staff. It's cute and diner-y inside with a lot of NOLA trinkets on the walls. Long lines on the weekends, but luckily we were seated right away on a Tuesday morning.

I'd highly recommend both of them. Another entree we ordered were the Creole Eggs, it was the special so I don't know if it's offered regularly. That was good too. We added on the Turkey Gumbo as an appetizer and that was very good for sharing. Even tho we all enjoyed the food, the Shrimp and Grits is the only thing that would bring me back.

Please do your soul a favor and come here!Let's begin with the star: shrimp and grits. I'm not even sure how to describe it except that it's borderline addicting. We almost ordered another at the end because we couldn't believe it was over. It was soooo savory without being too salty, or too greasy. I would make a trip back to NOLA JUST to have it again. The other entrees we ordered included: shrimp and creole omelet, bananas foster French toast, and biscuits and gravy. Omelet speaks for itself, absolutely delicious. Biscuits and gravy were good, but a bit of a letdown in comparison to all the other perfect food. Now, the bananas foster French toast, please try it. While I am usually against every type of French toast / bananas foster dessert, I had one bite of this and almost cried from how exceedingly far it blew me away. Pure deliciousness in every bite. It is just the right amount of sweet without making you sick, and the texture is just perfectly crunchy on the outside even though it's covered in syrup. Unbelievable. Long story short: I'll be damned if I don't give this place 5 stars (so rare for me), but it's so worth it. The price was so reasonable, the service was freaking excellent (shoutout to the lady with the personality manning the wait list), and the FOOD!!! Usually take the star ratings on Yelp with a grain of salt, but you must trust this place.

This place has lived in a golden memory from our last trip to New Orleans 6 years ago-every bananas fosters has failed to live up to our tastebuds' memory of Surrey's bananas fosters since then. SO there was a lot of hype going back-was it going to be the same? Better? Dear god, not worse! Reader, let me tell you-it was not. Everything was delightfully delicious and just a perfect way to spend a morning. First, get here at a weirdo time-its packed from open to close. Second, expect a wait no matter what time you get here-it is absolutely worth it. Set a timer and walk through the nearby streets, or go check out Mojo Coffee. Third, get the bananas foster to share with your crew. It is beyond delicious but it's an experience that needs to be shared. It's stuffed-STUFFED FRENCH TOAST PEOPLE- with this sweet sweet perfect banana cream. It is enormous. It is made to be enjoyed communally. Plus then it's like a breakfast appetizer, which is something we should do more often. The juice is great-super fresh. Pricey, but made just for you right there, so cool. The food itself is great-lots of veggies, yummy meat and solid portions. The shrimp and grits was bomb.

I would have liked more sauce served with my shrimp and grits. The little side toasts that they served with tasted stale. It would be much nicer if they put some butter and toasted it.
