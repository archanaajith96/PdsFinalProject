I was greeted by the friendliest bartender Jonathan. Since I was off today I ordered the seasonal cocktail which was a Mango and Jalapeño margarita. For my entree I ordered the filet on a stick. My food was amazing!! My husband and I come to Babalu often ,and one of our favorite starters is the guacamole make sure you add bacon. The staff here is friendly and very accommodating we will continue to make Babalu one of our go to restaurants."}, {"review_id": "LhVIssVo6mJyXTzeShOFnw", "user_id": "8sn1o9CfYpjb8Md51rUnrA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "The food and drink quality here is above average but the portion sizes for the price are well below average. The only food I can truly say is incredible here would be the table side guacamole. I could eat that every day. Other than that, I haven't ever truly had a spectacular meal here.

The sauce was just liquid without any distinct flavor. The tres leches was nearly $7 of a slab of dense cake (it was huge, so I felt even worse tossing it all). It was topped with blackberry which isn't at all authentic (lived in Latin America half a decade). You'd think it would taste good, right? But the flavor didn't mesh well with the evaporated, condensed, etc. milks. Just all around an overpriced and mediocre meal, honestly."}, {"review_id": "TgwfYsTexCSM0YDbcoJ9Fw", "user_id": "fwkwT4NSW4proYOZugUYnQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "I like Babalu. The service is questionable most of the time, but the food is pretty high quality. I'm not particularly a fan of their menu set-up. It's a little all over the place. I'm also confused about what exactly is their concept. However, I'm not confused by how delicious the tortilla chips are here. Seriously the best restaurant tortilla chips. It's thick and sturdy enough not to break apart holding any dip. Babalu also has the best table side guacamole in my opinion. The atmosphere is lively and fun and there's a little bit of something for everyone on the menu. I just wish the service was more consistent a majority of the time."}, {"review_id": "fMoXVi4qDoxFo3hlWVrcfg", "user_id": "jZTR-5gwO8Y_kbAwv99sqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/6/2017", "text": "Came here for their Friday night social hour special. Our group was seated immediately and got our drink orders going promptly. We each ordered sangrias ($4/each!). I got the white sangria and it was perfectly light and refreshing. I took sips of the red and rose sangria and they were both fantastic! The red sangria had a deeper flavor and the rose was also very light and refreshing (very citrusy!).I got 3 tacos (left to right): duck confit, tuna, and grilled shrimp. And they were AMAZING. So delicious and well balanced. The perfect mix of acid, umami and crunch. All the protein was cooked perfectly.Adding to the delicious factor was the fact it was only $2/taco! My entire meal cost $11 flat. Amazing taste for a great value. DEFINITELY recommend coming here for the weekday social hour from 4-6PM."}, {"review_id": "v1mXtqSF5KUr-6_wf3ZQnQ", "user_id": "dIaF0ad7hqzX3XleZhGdTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Babalus is outstanding. They have really pulled away from the pack with their innovative menu and brilliant flavor. Whenever my wife and I go it's hard to choose between the best guacamole in town made right at your table or the cheese dip mad from REAL cheese not that runny nick which comes from a tub, you can really taste the difference. Treat yourself in Tuesday's foe taco Tuesday for $2 tacos all night long, many different flavors, meats and combos to choose from. Or drop in for happy hour from 5-7 and enjoy some savings on wine, beer and sangria, they also have cocktails for those who fancy a speciality drink and a few different kinds of margaritas. All the small plates we have had so far have been delicious, it is tapas style but the plates are deceptively filling, my wife enjoys the lamb sliders a lot and I mix it up a bit each time we go and am yet to have something poor. I highly recommend you head down the lake view and give them a try."}, {"review_id": "YhAwI7M1tObPWjdoU0dLPw", "user_id": "Nctbqef0-nUi9tABzNEEyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Wonderful!

Great for happy hour on the patio (or inside at a table or the bar), as well as indoor dining. Fun place to take out of town guests.They have great happy hour specials. Their speciality margaritas (pineapple and jalepeno have been my favorites) are hard to beat (none of that high fructose processed syrup) and who can beat $2 tacos, especially when they have so many options from which to choose (duck, redfish, pork, chicken - I haven't tried one I didn't like).I highly recommend the table side guac. If you like heat, be sure to ask for the jalapenos. Also, don't be shy and be sure to ask for extra chips, especially if you've got a group sharing the guac.Although I have ordered traditional Mexican dishes on my first few visits, I flipped the script today and ordered the burger. I can definitely say I'm glad I did. Served on a sweet sourdough bun, it is topped with cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, and avocado. It also comes with tomatoes, but I asked for them to be left off. Overall it was perfect. Nice combo of crunchy, firm, and gooey. Also, great mix of sweet and salty flavors. I added the fries for $2. The size of both the burger and fries was pretty substantial, so it was enough to share."}, {"review_id": "fAjbjdGBRtmEdhrp6gLNPA", "user_id": "kSnlZhr5AcLmlIyDccv4OQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2017", "text": "Stopped here today for lunch after a long morning day of training at CSM Andrews Ortho. We had about six of us at the bar and about eight at a table. Our party of six ate at the bar and the others were all seated fairly quickly at a high top table. We had the freshly made guacamole and added the fresh vegetables. The guacamole and vegetables were extremely good. It definitely tasted fresh and those peppers were very crispy. I thoroughly enjoyed them. For my entrée I had the lamb sliders cooked medium. However, the temperature was grilled more well than medium-well. I added a side of the grilled broccolini with goat cheese. The broccolini was grilled perfectly.Overall, I definitely enjoyed my experience here and the food. Before eating, I visited the bathroom to wash my hands and noticed that it was well maintained and I liked that they carry mouth wash for their guests for after their meal. If I lived in Birmingham I would absolutely eat here frequently.Our server who was the bartender seemed very professional. Even though the entire time he was just prepping his bar and juicing lemons, he did check to make sure everything was okay.I'd recommend eating here at the bar.[Review #448] (33rd Review of 2017)"}, {"review_id": "n9YPdgc-A_0HhEUhBzyKPQ", "user_id": "E-jhvaC7aOPwRy6qjkdNCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Updating it to 5 stars. Went back after my last visit and the quality of service and food was significantly better. We were greeted at the front and seated almost right away .

I would prefer to give 3 1/2 stars, but I can't quite give 4. I love the broccolini with feta side option. I have not been overly impressed with any of the tacos, having tried the chicken, redfish, and tuna. They are served on corn tortillas and most include a sauce, which is usually too generously spread for my taste.The margaritas are great! Last time I went there was a special cilantro Fresno margarita, which was delicious! It had a little bit of Serano pepper to give it just enough spice for a libation. I'm not sure if this option is available regularly, as this is the only time I have seen it. The cheese dip appetizer is unlike any other. It is served in a skillet made of cast-iron and is more of a melted stringy cheese than a traditional Mexican style runny cheese dip. It is also served with pico de gallo and has a squirt of adobo on top. Is very rich and needs to be shared, but also delicious! The tableside guacamole is delicious as well and they also offer an option with bacon at it! What could be better than guacamole dip with bacon?Parking is always difficult at Lakeview, so be prepared to walk. The patio seating area is lovely on nice days, although the salon tends to bear down particularly hard in this area and they have recently gotten rid of the umbrellas that they used to have.Overall, this is a hip Mexican fusion restaurant."}, {"review_id": "XIin3dFWgqkOVNYNsf77Rw", "user_id": "JGPJWP_U6D0Tc4dJBOBcOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Very good the queso with the pork belly is my favorite!

It is made at your table and it is really good. Riped avocados, onions, sundries tomatoes, lemon and salt. The only complain I had is that it had too much salt. I ordered two tacos, 1 duck and fried cow. The tacos were amazing, great flavor, good ratio of meat and veggies. They were very fulfilling to me accompanied by the guacamole. I ordered the dulce de leche cheesecake bites. It was okay not as great as I thought it would be but good. It had a sweet taste of Kalua. It needs more dulce de leche flavor.
