It was effing awesome. awesome enough that I might be driving out of my way to stop here again.  Also, the place is cute as hell. So freaking cute.  Save your receipt after stopping at Slap's BBQ.  They will give you 20% off your purchase! After my BBQ induced coma I waddled across the street for a pick-me-up. So worth the short jaunt."}, {"review_id": "YxDSjM6S3OLjIY5fa0gX1w", "user_id": "AsUh-UQlJbZGInsV01CflA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Cutest little coffee shop in the KC area!  Only wish they were open Sundays too but glad the fabulous staff gets to enjoy it.  This place is such a neighborhood gem with such a cozy and intimate vibe.  Everyone that walks in is friendly like we are all neighbors.  The place is tiny so the drive-thru is genius.  BUT, I recommend sitting inside and just soaking up the chill atmosphere.  The place transports you to somewhere else.  They carry Messenger coffee and then a few guests roasts.  They have everything you could want; pour overs, drip, decadent drinks and tea.  Pastries are from SunFlour Bakery in KC and donuts from Hana's of course.I always order a Cafe Au Lait with almond milk, extra hot wherever I go and husband always orders an iced coffee.  Pretty hard to mess up the au lait but very few places get the extra hot request right, Splitlog does.  That shows me they are good baristas (some are too scared they will burn it) and that they listen.  Iced coffee can be bad in many ways but again spot on at Splitlog.  Husband even got a refill.  Refills are at a discounted price.  We had a scone and an apple filled donut. Both were delicious.  Moist and fresh.  There are no hot items (as of yet) but they had donuts, muffins, scones and croissants.  For sure all sweet options.  Very kid friendly and seemed to have all of the basic dairy free options along with Stevia and simple syrup.  Love this place and although it is a drive for us we have added them to our list of regulars!"}, {"review_id": "bEa3sNkP908YkkUWbnXseQ", "user_id": "MidqyIP2_vozrgEjDKrO0A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "The location is new and a bit small. The inside was nice with customized decor and had a home-y vibe. I went with some friends and we ordered a latte and a red velvet donut. The latte was not too strong with two shots of espresso and they messed up the latte art and didn't care to redo it. The donut was a little dry. I feel I can get a better coffee and donut elsewhere for the price I paid. I would definitely stop in again if nearby for the coffee, not necessarily for the pastries."}, {"review_id": "jYGURdxYD5sWWRjxtsLiOw", "user_id": "Z4QJ_V9jid4IRG4191MQZA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Saw alot of good reviews on yelp and it's nearby so thought I'd give them a try! So they didn't greet us when we walked in but did once we got to the counter. I noticed they did to others but for some reason not me. They were patient with us since it was our 1st time here and nice to answer any questions we had. We got the Latte for dine in and 1 iced latte and 1 iced macchiato. We also tried their red velvet donut. The latte was smooth but not that strong in flavor and the iced latte was average, nothing special. The iced macchiato was basically like the latte. The red velvet donut was okay, it tasted like it was store bought. Overall it was average. Probably good to try if you're in the area but nothing to go out of your way to try out. It does have cute exterior and interior decor so you can visit to chat and catch up with friends."}, {"review_id": "jbrONUNN_GeiNZMiZTqWTQ", "user_id": "nx3gtrrFfe_EUuOiGK7y5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/28/2017", "text": "Boom. One visit, five stars. Splitlog is everything I love about coffee shops both in and outside the Metro. Quaint location on Central Ave in Kansas City, KS - check. Messenger beans for espresso and drinks - check. Hip crowd content to sit and sip, work, or chat - check. Outdoor seating with an outstanding view of the KC skyline - check. Splitlog is another outstanding example of superb coffee in Kansas City, something that seems to be on a meteoric rise. Drip black is my drink and Splitlog doesn't disappoint. There are a few assorted pastry options available if you're into that, as well. It's a small building, but there are plenty of seats around to work, chat, or hang out. I'm ecstatic there is another great coffee joint open that is homegrown and knows what they are doing. Can't wait to return often!"}, {"review_id": "PA8DhiAu6ecytua1gycTKQ", "user_id": "e0Z3Ug1JFHdfqBZPRVkbGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Just stopped by splitlog for the KC coffee trip passport and got an 8oz coffee, cream, and sugar.

No longer necessary to drive into downtown KCMO or the River Market for a proper espresso. Sure, there are a couple of pretenders, but they're not even close.Splitlog has everything I want in a great coffee shop. Yea, it's more than just great coffee, and here's why: I want all of these good things to make my life happier:- cool place to hang out with the laptop, good wireless coverage. (check)- great espresso drinks and a barista that really knows their business. (check)- a drive through for the really greedy (check)- nice outdoor seating on the street to bask in the sun with your morning cup. (check)- a picnic table behind the shop for really, really hanging out. (check)- a great house black cup with some serious presence. (check)And while I'm at it, nice people and some righteous baked goods to complete the visit. Beautifully designed, great private parking (don't you folks going to Slap's BBQ be taking my spot!), what else do you want? I can't name a single thing. Whoever these folks are, they've done a great thing in bringing quality coffee and espresso to this part of town. It was about time, and Splitlog has hit this ball clear out of the park."}, {"review_id": "ymqaY1a-vGIPYi5OJp_G2g", "user_id": "UP_helNPc845BjGlFieW9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/21/2017", "text": "I live in Strawberry Hill and drive right by this spot on my way to work.
