I have high expectations for restaurants like this, only because I've actually had authentic Chinese food, back when I lived in Asia and also I've tried other authentic Chinese dishes at a Chinese friends' home. Anyway... Have you guys ever experienced, being full with what you ate but not satisfied? Well, that's exactly how it was after dining in here. Although we only spent $35 bucks, I don't think it was worth the bucks. I had a high expectations with this restaurant because of the high reviews but only to be disappointed. I ordered spicy calamari, wonton soup, a fish soup and a bowl of rice.-So the rice. Rice is very important in Asian cuisine, therefore my expectations in rice is pretty high and the rice served here was CRAP! It was a low quality of rice-Wonton soup was OK. I would rate it 3/5, because it has a bland taste, and the pork tasted kinda old but I think it was just the recipe? The chili sauce on the other hand was AWESOME, it wasn't just spicy but it had flavor to it. -Spicy calamari was quite pricey for the amount of squid we got. I would rate it 3/5 also. The taste was also bland, doesn't really have much flavor to it besides the saltiness, just that and some spiciness to it. -Hot and Tangy fillet soup was FILLED with sesame oil but it was alright! I rate it 3.5/5. There was barely any noodles but the amount of fillet of fish was pretty good. Also, the lady said the serving was family style and it was not. One serving can be finished by 1 person. **The owner did ask how the food tasted and offered how she can get us something else if we are not happy - We just simply said the food was good only because we don't think the food we'll get as a replacement would get any better, especially since if the wonton soup, a very simple dish was already not good & the rest of the dish we ordered** Overall, they have a great customer service and the rest of the staff was also friendly & very helpful (this was probably the only thing I liked about this restaurant). I would rate them 6/10, overall. Random fact: The owner is very nice and helpful and also very pretty!

My life isn't organized enough to do that. It's a little unfair to single out Sichuan House for this, but this issue has been plaguing Chinese restaurants for far too long and has to be addressed. Why do you only have lo mein noodles? And why do you think udon is acceptable as a substitute? And the answer to those questions is because we as consumers let them do it and don't educate ourselves in the differences in noodles. Shame on us."}, {"review_id": "iB3pMx35O72pyUymnh20BQ", "user_id": "CfhBf-UFS2uI6Ghe5uR9sQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "YO. WHAT? This is the best evah evah!!! I mean listen to how I started this review... (????) Okay, to be honest, I don't have much to compare it to in San Antonio because I haven't really had authentic Chinese food in San Antonio. BUT I have had authentic Chinese in Fort Worth and this place is so legit! We get spicy tofu, twice fried pork (in veggies) and I really wanted Chinese water spinach (idk what the name of it is, but Filipinos call it kang kong) but it was out of season. I was bummed, but before I could through an inner toddler fit, the waiter offered an alternative (see pic) and it's JUUUUST as good. Super. Freakin. YUM. I'm so glad I came. ALSO, they had this tea with rice in it -- you'll have to ask -- I normally just get green tea, but this was amazing. I want to go back so badly and soon. Great portions, taste, and service. A little far from my house, but that's never stopped my fat butt before! You should definitely check it out if you think Panda Express is all San Antonio has to offer!"}, {"review_id": "w_ekhQCpM_1AG52zEBVgAw", "user_id": "bBIsg912kX1mlk5ytnCi1w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Sichuan House closest thing that I can get to Bellaire in Houston whenever I'm craving authentic Chinese cuisine. I've been here a few times and I can honestly say that it's one of my favorites in SA. I have yet to try anything \"spicy\" since most of their dishes are supposedly spicy. I have a moderately high tolerance so none of the food has phased me. I highly recommend coming with a group as their food is served family style.I visited this past weekend and we shared a few dishes:*Crispy & Spicy Chicken: First of all, not spicy at all. Some pieces were a bit dry. I wasn't crazy about this one and I wouldn't order it again considering there are other great options on their menu.*Dong Po Pork Belly: Definitely a must every time I visit. I usually don't enjoy pork belly since it's so fatty but this dish is amazing. It's so soft and tender. The pork belly literally melts in your mouth. *Spicy & Savory Fish: We didn't realize that it was fried. We usually order water-boiled fish from other Sichuan restaurants in Houston and thought it would be similar. Even though it wasn't what we expected, we ended up LOVING it. It was our favorite out of the three. The fish was crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The flavor was incredible but not spicy at all. During my past few visits I also tried the Pan-Fried Dumplings and the Calamari.  From what I remember, the dumplings were average, nothing special. But the calamari was pretty freaking good, I recommend it. The staff is always nice and friendly. I'm craving Sichuan House again as I'm writing this review.

The food was unlike any other Chinese I had eaten, whether in or out of the country. Over the years I searched here and there hoping to find duplicate dishes and flavors. Not much success until, with a group of seven other food adventurers, I ate at Sichuan House this afternoon.As has been mentioned in other reviews, the menu can be daunting; take a look at the photos, I bet you'll agree. Plus, I'm including another page from the menu not previously published--the 23 flavors of Sichuanese cuisine. But fear not--the staff is more than willing to help you navigate through it. Our table was lucky to have Michael as our server. He was intimately familiar with every dish on the menu, could explain each one and even their subtle nuances so we could make an informed decision. I noticed a dish that I had many times in Chengdu: poached spicy chicken, a cross between a spicy soup and a stew. Because the spicing is exacting in this dish, it's not found on many menus.The most famous flavor profile of Sichuan cuisine is known as \"ma la\"--hot and numbing. The dish did have some heat and good quality chili oil was thoughtfully provided. You must understand that \"some\" heat for me would sear the tongues of most people but still, the dish needed more. The numbing quality was there but faintly. The manager, who was kind enough to visit our table, explained that it's very difficult to obtain the quality of chilis and Sichuan peppercorns (which are not true pepper but rather a member of the Rutaceae [rue and citrus] family) available in China. I have had the same problem myself finding these so her statement was fully understandable. But the dish was delicious as it stood and the over all flavor was a match to what I had in China.A word needs to be said about the hot tea and rice. There are four teas offered and other than the typical jasmine and oolong, there is also chrysanthemum (which is popular in China and has no caffine) and genmatcha (also spelled \"genmaicha\"). This latter is the one I chose as it's the most unusual--a mixture of green tea and roasted rice. It had a very pleasing flavor, with the rice providing a natural sweetness with slightly toasty notes. The rice was a mixture of long grain and jasmine; the combination gave it a pleasing texture and a flavor that could stand on its own as well as be a perfect foil for the food itself. I also spooned some sauce from my chicken over it and ate with abandon!And for those who don't like their food spicy, there are plenty of non-spicy dishes available as well as vegetarian and gluten-free options. So do yourself a favor and pay a visit to Sichuan House; your taste buds will thank you!"}, {"review_id": "eVz6J94U-eL32e80quc4xw", "user_id": "vQAM8ZNOl9mzScxdwSd1DA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "Really great service, friendly, and knowledgeable staff.  The menu is quite extensive, and they have several types of hot tea, other drinks, and even several variations on things like pork belly.  Our group of 7 had many questions about \"what's the difference between this pork belly and that pork belly\" and \"what's the difference between this tea and that tea?\"And guess what.  We didn't get the typical, ummmm I'm not sure, let me go and find out.  Our server was Michael G. and he knew SO much about the menu, I initially thought he might be the owner. This was my first impression with the place and you know what they say about first impressions - they make it or break it, and Michael MADE this one!I had the Kung Pao Tofu which might sound boring to some of you, but hey - I also asked for a fork instead of chop sticks, so I really am not trying to impress anyone here - lol!Two in our group had different variations of the pork belly, another had the poached spicy chicken and two or three others had the crispy chicken.  Another had some sort of veggie soup with tofu and it came in a huge bowl.  Most of us took left overs home.Then the owner came out and spoke to us for a few minutes - she was VERY nice and friendly.All in all, this was a great experience - from customer service to the quality of the food.And they do have several vegetarian/vegan items available on the menu if that is your thing.Check this place out my friends!"}, {"review_id": "_ctAqsASR2rj134qUlHthQ", "user_id": "HcSaA57N1GpInbuzAPN4aw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Yucky !

Our fault.We also had two orders of dump and spring rolls which were delicious.For our main courses we ordered the Braised Pork Belly which was our favorite, also ordered the Green Beans with Jumbo Shrimp which was light and tasty.

The DongPo underbelly pork tasted much sweeter than I expected and with too much garlic.

(Shameless plug, check Yelp Events for UYEs.) We are doing a \"Around the World\" series of lunches in 2018. Sichuan House has rave reviews in Yelp so many of us chose Sichuan House for our Feb lunch. No one in our group had ever been to Sichuan House so none of us could help on what to order or what the ordering process is all about. Although our server Michael was really great and informative, when the owner Kristina stopped by our table, she mentioned to me that he should have told us about the family style concept. You know I read and heard about it, but I guess it didn't really register... and well, I really wasn't up to sharing my dish in the first place (although samples were shared here and there). I knew I wanted to order pork belly and whatever I didn't eat at lunch, I wanted to take home... and so I did! It was just as good the second time around and even hubby like it too! Oh what did I have, the savory pork belly which came with steamed rice. Add in some hot chili oil and Yum!I typically only drink lemon water with my meals, but on this occasion I decide on hot tea. I chose chrysanthemum as it has no caffeine which was fine with me. I enjoyed my tea, nice and smooth. Since we have a group of 8 at our lunches, we make reservations and usually start at 11am... and our lunches typically last two hours. Sichuan House had our meals out quick, it seemed almost too quick as we like to chat and get to know each other. Well, this also meant that our meal was over quickly... and it was barely after noon. Some left while the rest of us kept chatting. Then I remember looking up and seeing a large party standing outside. And we all looked around at the full house and figured out that they were probably waiting for our table. Honestly, I felt a little rushed at that point, not much, but still a little. Our service was excellent. Mike was outstanding. I even remarked on their tablet use for orders and check out. This tablet even gives me options for tips which is cool but odd % like 17, 23, etc. I laughed. This would have been nice when I was serving tables 30 years ago. The menu is extensive so I'm glad that I knew what I wanted before I arrived or I would have sat there forever not knowing what I wanted. I would like to go back to try some other dishes like the steamed buns. Thank you so much Kristina for having us at Sichuan House!"}, {"review_id": "LLbX2fpMYZhx8j9JSGZB3w", "user_id": "parFZ1jrcxxbFDgwrDAtGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "I've heard wonders about this place from several friends and foodies. I can honest to god say that I understand now what everyone was talking about. First off the place is in a small joint located inside a strip mall center. When you walk in, it's a pretty cozy place but the wait staff is on point ready to lead you to your table. I got to try the Braised Pork Belly which was such a delicacy! The marbled meat tasted good and the fat wasn't so overpowering that it took over the pork meat. It was a great dish! I also would like to talk about the Spicy Savory Fish! I am not a seafood person, actually I hate seafood but I tried this fish and WOW! I don't know whether it was the spiciness, the marinade, or the breading, but the fish was delicious!!!!! I would actually go and order that as my main entree next time. I was very impressed. It didn't have that fishy taste or nothing!  We also tried the cold garlic noodles which were mixed right in front of us, again another epic dish i highly recommend.

As with any Asian restaurant, I always recommend that people go family style - bring a bunch of your friends, family members w/ you and try lots of dishes! However, this place doesn't have a lot of seating (or parking either), so I would call ahead and make a reservation if you plan on having a party of larger than 6 people. Or go on a random weekday when the crowds may not be as large. The staff were friendly - had great recommendations for what we should order and what their favorites were. Here are some of my favorites! Dongpo Pork Belly Mapo Tofu - have to order at any Sichuan restaurant. it's a classic Garlicky Cold Noodles  Spicy Garlic Eggplant Sichuan food is notorious for its numbing spicy quality to it, so be prepared.

That was great planning, because as we got into the 12 o'clock hour, there was simply no open tables. I think this is a testament to the quality of their food. To start, the menu IS a little intimidating, but don't worry. The server, Michael, was super helpful in helping you decide on your entree selections. It's clear he has a passion for food as he took his time to explain the nuances of the flavors and compared them to the ingredients used to prepare them. They have a full line of milk teas (similar to boba tea without the tapioca). I had the leechi milk tea and it was sweetly delicious. It was the prefect precursor to my pork belly meal. This wasn't a lunch portion folks. There was enough for two people. All entrees are \"family style\" and can be shared with your table. Steamed rice is included with your meal. Fried rice is not an available option. The place is clean. The service was amazing. The food was out of this world.

As a vegetarian I kind of am limited to a few dishes at a lot of Chinese restaurants so I tried the vegetable fried rice and one of the tofu dishes. Spring rolls for appetizers. Vegetable noodles. I felt it was pretty good overall. The vegetable fried rice tasted great. My tofu dish was good as well. Tofu is usually medium firm here and the vegetables also added flavor. It comes with a bowl of white rice. The others were all pretty good Chinese food. We basically ordered the big popular dishes so you can't really go wrong with them. As an Indian, I'm used to a lot of spices, and in the dishes I ordered, there wasn't so much in them, as they naturally are not made with a lot.
