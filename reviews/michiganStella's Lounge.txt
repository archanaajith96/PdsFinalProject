I've had many on their regular menu and sampled numerous of their monthly special \"creature features\" and have never been disappointed.Although, their food is delicious (even the non-burger choices- try the nada cubano and you may never order a burger there again!) I come back time and time again for the atmosphere. It is laid back and fun. The decor is dark and restaurant uses arcade games as art but it never seems dim.They have good happy hour options, and on Thursdays, they offer $5 off all burgers with a drink purchase."}, {"review_id": "fSlAZM9BSUqiFq_xAhyoaw", "user_id": "MsSvsCun_xzoBj0Y9C-vYA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Drinks: Good.

We opted not sitting at the table right by the door. That must have offended the hostess so she sat 4 parties in front of us even though we stated any other table was fine.  People seated around also were commenting on how miserable the hostess seemed and how tables sat empty for long periods before she finally sat someone.  Our waitress was friendly and did a good job. The food was just ok - definitely had better at many places.  Our Burgers over cooked and dry but the onions rings were delicious. Fun and unique atmosphere but we won't be returning.   We wanted to love this place but first impressions make a difference and we weren't impressed at all.**** Stella's responded to this post.  It is nice to see that management reads reviews and reaches out patrons to gain a better understanding of their experience.

A little dark and definitely loud, but upbeat and fun vibe. I was in town for work so I ventured here solo. The waitress was super helpful and I appreciated her recommendations. As a beer connoisseur, there were quite a few options, especially local options. For a southeast Michigan gal, I am a big fan of the brews they have in GR and Stella's has a good variety. As for the food, I went with the stuffed bleu burger, Ted Avocado Nugents and plain fries. Two thumbs up on the burger. The Nugents are deep fried so you definitely have to be in the mood for that - I wasn't really, but glad I gave them a whirl. I really wanted to try the chronic fries but I have sissy tongue so can't really do anything spicy. Overall, good food. Fun spot for a group or even just drinks but would definitely getting some grub if you can."}, {"review_id": "PHgRKsS8dN2ctrG0LRWc6w", "user_id": "OCze_nBEVgxU3F-p_JpUlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "Stella's Lounge had been on my list for quite some time, partly because of the reviews I've read and partly because I wanted to go to a restaurant with my name in it! Thankfully, overall it didn't disappoint.The restaurant reminds me a lot of HopCat in several ways. The format of the menu, the atmosphere of the restaurant, and the types of food offered are very similar. I love HopCat, so I was excited about this! Stella's is known for its burgers, so of course I had to order one. They all sounded delicious, but I ended up picking the queso jalapeno. I was starving, so I also added some of the fried avocado as a side.I loved every bite of the burger. It was cooked the way I wanted (medium rare), and the flavor was on point. I also liked the fries a lot! However, I was disappointed about the fried avocado. I think I got maybe four pieces... Save your money, and don't order this.The service was a bit spotty, but luckily I wasn't in a rush to leave. The food is worth the trip, and I can't wait to return when I'm back in Grand Rapids!"}, {"review_id": "CSZ9ojtmVETSiS-UaXiFrg", "user_id": "caW0d-buJpAHQaFkudaBwg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "I truly love Stella's: the food, the drinks, the atmosphere, and [usually] the crowd. However, I must say that very much miss the days when one half of the building was a classy bar called The Viceroy, and Stella's restaurant & bar occupied the other portion. Eventually, Stella's expanded into the entire space. Much of the cool red lighting and black walls and such still linger from The Viceroy era, but the funkiness/grunginess of Stella's has overtaken the establishment with graffiti murals and a fuckton of retro arcade boxes with some serious 80's and 90's classics like Ms. Pacman, Tron, Tetris, Mortal Kombat, and Street Fighter II... it's a good ol' nostalgic time if you have a few quarters in your pocket. Also expect retro cartoons like Scooby Doo, He Man or the old Mario Bros. tv series to be playing on their flatscreens. Moreover, they generally play great music. Stella's is the only bar in town where I've heard Portishead's Dummy album from start to finish, so mad kudos on that.The drinks are not especially cheap, but definitely reasonably priced, and they're always running specials. Great tap list too. Oh, and I can't forget to mention their Stella Punch, which might be their biggest bang for your buck. It's a very high gravity amalgam of various liquors and fruit punch (maybe some wine mixed in too?) in a big black plastic cup. Goes down easy and makes you more fun VERY quickly. Plus you get to keep the cool black cup which may or may not have Bruce Lee or Iggy Pop on it. The food is excellent. I took my picky parents to their Sunday brunch recently and they loved it. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options. Their seasoned \"chronic fries\" are legendary, as are their \"vegan wings.\" So this is a funny subject because whenever i rave about Stella's vegan wings to unknowing friends, their perplexed reactions are quite entertaining. So basically they're imitation \"chicken\" clusters, probably derived from some sort crazy GMO soy god-knows-what, slathered in one of their various buffalo wing sauces, deep fried vegan deliciousness. Whatever vegan wings actually are made of, I don't really care because they taste amazing, and always satisfy my greasy junk food cravings. My favorite flavor is the sweet chili sauce and i like to dip them in their [actually hot] house hot sauce. Paired with their slightly spicy seasoned chronic fries and a Stella Punch, I have been known to go into a yoga flame trance, ready to destroy anyone at Street Fighter II. Also, their karaoke Sunday nights are a blast. I would go every Sunday if my schedule allowed, just sayin..."}, {"review_id": "__iJ_vS3PN_hM7VguZk1CA", "user_id": "uMt0hkqgwFFmcCpH8OOXTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So we ventured here for brunch on the weekend. They have an excellent brunch menu. The place was hoppin' but we got seated within 5 minutes. The food took FOREVER to get out to us though. I got the Angry Joon (Smoked salmon, spinach, poached eggs, open-faced on bread and topped habanero hollandaise.) It came with a side of \"Poor Man's Hash\" which was chunks of potato wedges with onions and peppers and topped with Buffalo Sauce - it was so good I could have just eaten a whole plate of that. The main course of my meal was just okay - my eggs were fully cooked and the hollondaise surprisingly isn't spicy at all.My friend got the Hash Pile (Stella's hash, chili, queso, bacon, 2 fried eggs, onions, tomatoes, buffalo sauce, and Old Grand-Dad maple syrup - which tasted like it had liquor in it!) The meal was kind of just like a pile of slop that a college kid would make at home, but it tasted really good so who cares. Didn't spot any queso anywhere on it, but still very delicious - the syrup totally made it.Then there was the Bloody Mary Bar - it's so big it has to be in the back half of Stellas. The food items (meats, cheeses, Olive's, etc) are in a salad bar type of thing and then there is a whole table of sauces, seasonings, etc. To start with, there were multiple different flavored vodkas/whiskeys that you could choose from. By far the best Bloody Mary Bar I've ever seen!"}, {"review_id": "DPny_gRiaVKOC82rZCbqZQ", "user_id": "E99PmzemavhAxUMNOGKlWQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Most of the employees are incredibly arrogant.

Depending on the day, the seating situation can be hard and there is usually a long line of guests waiting for a seat.Tip: try to sit at the bar, as it can be faster than waiting for a table to open. No name on waiting list is required. But be careful, other guests are onto this technique. You'll be battling other vultures.The burgers and fries are awesome. They have a good menu.

My service has been better than average lately and our waitress last night was awesome - very friendly and attentive.This is a fun place to take the kids during the slow hours. I would advise against bringing the family during peak hours. My favorite app thus far is the stuffed tots, but I also love the cheddar jalapeno poppers and the BLT nachos. I do not recommend the 'Chronic Fries' as they are really salty. I would just get the naked fries and get something to dip them in.

Definitely a place with an identity of its own, a distinct Hippie-stoner vibe. The video arcade games on the perimeter of the dining area is a nice touch. The lady preaching to me on the plane from NY to GRR was correct, in that it definitely consists of younger crowd. My sister is obsessed with Nachos so we got those. They were a hit. Then with the help of our friendly, efficient server Jeremy we ordered burgers to fit our cravings. The medium well was perfect and standard temp for Stella, as close to well done on the outside but was juicy on the inside. The taste of the burger and the ridiculous toppings like jalapeño poppers led me to toss the bun and cut it into the Chronic French fries. No amateur move. I declined Jeremy's offer for a new one because \"it looked stupid\". We noticed some gluten free and vegan options. For instance, Vegan Meatloaf. If your looking for solid service, food and atmosphere Stella's is perfect.
