Mezza Luna is what I would call a quintessential pizza parlor but with a decided amount of Eugene flair. Last night I had an about-to-expire coupon for $4 off a large pizza that we meant to use on Pi Day back in March. I managed to convince the hubby that we should actually eat at the restaurant rather than ordering carryout like we have done in the past. It was so delicious and so worth it! Fresh, colorful, piping hot, and satisfying. We were surprised at how bustling it was on a Sunday night, which made for interesting people-watching. The decor is warm and inviting, with crescent moon and star cut-outs adorning the walls, and large front windows look out onto Pearl Street for additional viewing pleasure. We opted for a pizza with half The Boot and half Savory Garden (sub mushrooms for artichoke hearts), that way the hubby had Italian sausage for his meat-loving mentality, I had plenty of veggies for my \"eat a rainbow\" inclination, plus hubby didn't have to pick off toppings that he didn't like. (He dislikes artichoke hearts as a rule because they're usually canned or jarred.) Two large slices apiece were plenty for Sunday night dinner, and I am thrilled that we have half of our pizza left over to reheat for supper tonight. I noticed tables nearby receiving generous, yummy looking salads. Next time we might go the salad and slices route just to mix it up a little--or perhaps the salad and whole pie route because leftovers really do make it twice as nice! :)"}, {"review_id": "9gstF12Ug1Ce0eO3LYbHyw", "user_id": "Cmk9SfxjN-V5QCxxb9IMlw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "The salads are huge, garlic knots are a must, and the pizza is decently priced and sold by the slice. We visited as a group of four, ordered the Boot pizza, garlic knots, and the spinach salad. We shared everything and still had 2-3 slices of pizza to take home. My only \"complaint\" is I wish the beer selection was larger, I love a good beer and pizza. But that has nothing to do with their food, which is great!"}, {"review_id": "QVYnTzZcAZJy8Qug6cN1tg", "user_id": "8yoyeebZmEVUx47KhjK5QA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "I love the name. Names are important, because it's how we remember the shops we love. Their pizza is also delicious and very much memorable. The multiple pizzas they offer on display are freshly made with a variety of toppings. They sell by the slice too, a good option for big groups. I got a veggie slice loaded with my special item...artichokes! If you've never done artichokes on pizza, try it just once here! When it comes to toppings, Mezza Luna seems to be more generous than some. The crust was a nice crispy texture with decent sauce and cheese. I applaud this business for not making wimpy or crunchy pizza. It's the right flavor and texture to satisfy most palettes. Mezza Luna is a nice petite cafe in a more casual space. I don't remember if they had outdoor seating but if they do than that's even better!"}, {"review_id": "fIKdMDTeKV3X6ejfC5oBbw", "user_id": "F-EbFdJ3gt7kMHjL5QNgpw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Recently revisited to this location and a 90% turnaround.

I ordered the stinky garden pizza and it was definitely tasteless. I had a 8 min drive home and the pizza was already cold. It's not worth the $17 price tag! I will not be returning to this place. Maybe I should have had the salad instead.

BF found this place on Yelp. SERVICE- 5 STARSService was incredible from the start. You order at the counter, then you grab a table and wait for the our food to be brought out. They also have pizza by the slice.FOOD-4 STARSBF Ordered a whole pizza for himself thinking we would be able to finish it but definitely couldn't. They pack on the meat which is great.So then I ordered a calzone. Thinking it wouldn't be too big, i also ordered a small Ceaser  salad. Once the calzone came out to me. I literally said \" OH MY GOSH THAT HUGE\" half of it was way too much for me. I'm not exaggerating on how big it was.

I really like their crust because it actually tastes like real handmade dough. The toppings are plentiful and also very fresh. I've grabbed a slice inside and grabbed a large pizza to go. The place itself is your normal pizzeria with tables and a case of slices to choose from. It was nice and clean the last time I was there. When I ordered on the phone for pickup  it only took 20 minutes for it to be ready which was great. There is metered parking out front or you can pay to park in the parking lot across the street. I really like their garlic and olive oil based pizzas since too much tomato sauce can be a little acidic. It makes the pizza taste lighter and lets the ingredients shine through. Definitely one of the better pizza places in town!"}, {"review_id": "Q-LBEeeO3M1bGHFNZi6HZQ", "user_id": "O1Sr_PpqhBSDX2vuVuTuaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/13/2017", "text": "Best customer service at a pizza joint in town. Since I live near a Pegasus I tend to get pizza there and forget about Mezza Luna. This is a huge mistake! Not only do they have pizza by the slice, but Mezza Luna serves some of the best side salads I've eaten in Eugene. They also have a nice beer and wine selection, and are super fast at getting your pizza out of the oven.

I went with a slice of the spinach, artichoke & feta with a twist- habañero pizza sauce! WOW, the spice sneaks up quick on you, but is quite tasty- & balances out the salt from the feta & tang from the artichoke nicely. Overall, a decent deal for $5.25!

We spontaneously decided on pizza for dinner and thought we would just drive over to the Pearl location and eat there. Fortunately I thought to call in our order ahead of time, so that about 3 minutes after we arrived, our two large pizza's were piping hot out of the oven and we did not have to wait really at all. That worked out really well considering we were there with our young children. We got a cheese pizza and a fungi trio pizza. The dough was crispy and the ingredients fresh.  The large size alone would have been enough for our family but now we have leftovers. My kids enjoyed the cheese, and my husband and I enjoyed the fungi trio. I like the assortment of cheese, as well as the mushrooms, and red and yellow bell peppers. I also love the fresh whole pieces of garlic on top. Absolutely delicious and very filling. Mezzaluna has never disappointed and yet again, we all left full, happy and with plenty of leftovers.
