It has a variation of interesting and the staple flavors that are all very consistent and delicious. I was honestly blown away by the flavors! My favorite by far was the wild blueberry. Amazing. I could eat it everyday. Tastes like a frosted blueberry muffin. I also really like the cremé brulee, vanilla bean and matcha. I spent 20 dollars on donuts and it was totally worth it. Would go back! Definitely stop by if you're in the city."}, {"review_id": "-GQy-EPxW6a8_GWOT0n0Gg", "user_id": "REWjbYaUkmGw04lNZraeQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "A good doughnut is a one that doesn't leave your mouth with the taste of grease after a few bites -- the donuts from Doughnut Plant certainly do not. I tried out the matcha doughnut as well as the pistachio doughnut this afternoon on my visit. The matcha was more cake like while the pistachio was more fluffy so to compare the two would be difficult. I do have to say both were *very* flavorful. There was no mistaking the donuts for matcha and pistachio.I wouldn't say I'm convinced doughnuts are the go-to breakfast item after having a doughnut here, but I'm definitely more willing to buy a full doughnut now than before (I previously would only stick to a few doughnut holes as that was my limit). Plant has lots of flavors to choose from so even the most picky of eaters will be able to find something that will satisfy their palettes."}, {"review_id": "D9e0254-lIiY4X6x4NYP9w", "user_id": "9YtWV382h-90NfvdxQEuUQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Nothing against the donuts at all. They were good. And expensive. Been coming here a couple of times but the last time, I ordered 4 donuts and one of them was that Creme Brulee one that cost over 4 bucks a pop. Paid for everything and out the door I went. Feeling excited about eating my damn fancy donuts. I walked 5 blocks and decided to eat one on the way and I opened the bag and to my dismay, saw only 3 donuts in the bag! And it's the Creme Brulee that's missing!! Took me 10 seconds to decide if it's worth going 5 blocks back and it was. So with steams coming out of my ears, I walked back to the damn place. I told the cashier girl who took my order and my money what happened and she acted dumb and the other dude told her what was missing. She took the donut and gave it to me and I was like, that's it?? No apology no nothing??!! I was speechless and just stared at them b*tches and he was like, what, you want a free donut? I walked out. If I'd stayed longer I would've punched them in the face.YOU HAD ONE JOB, WOMAN!

Strangely this donut was dry in some places and moist in others and I couldn't tell where the pudding was as there was never an actual pocket of it anywhere. Still, this was the best one we tried.Black & White CakeCake donut that is half vanilla with vanilla glaze and half chocolate with chocolate glaze. Super creative, but the vanilla side was extremely sweet. The chocolate side was more balanced, but it wasn't as good as the Blackout. Only a tad dry.Manhattan CreamMini yeast donut covered (fully!) in chocolate glaze and surprisingly not filled with Bavarian cream (a la a Boston Cream) but instead what seems to be the same vanilla buttery filling as the creme brulee.Creme BruleeMini yeast donut (they call them doughseeds) with creme brûlée filling, topped with caramelized sugar. Supposedly this type of donut was invented here, which is pretty cool. Unfortunately it misses the mark on the best part of a creme brûlée--the crunch! The top of this donut is chewy instead of crunchy, and overall their yeast dough is much chewier than a typical light and fluffy donut. The filling is pretty good, though--buttery with flecks of vanilla bean.Super creative donuts here, for texture and taste there are better options in the city."}, {"review_id": "JzCwhkhtpJjdWlULoGJT3g", "user_id": "_hWkF2xhkDf9zhmt11iCVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I came here as part of my Five Borough Bucket List journey to all the \"omg you have to try this!\" places.

I was very excited considering all the really high reviews. The tres leches was meh, definitely needed to be soaked in milk more, only the bottom was at all close to moist. I microwaved half of it and it got like 5 times better so I definitely recommend that. It makes the donut a lot more moist. So, microwaved, i really liked the donut. The creme brûlée on the other hand I didn't like at all. The only plus it's got is a crunchy top but the vanilla custard inside had such a weird flavor, definitely did not resemble creme brûlée. Mine also tasted a bit stale, so i was pretty unimpressed.

When I began coming here, the only location to choose from was Grand St. Then Chelsea opened up and now you can even score these doughnuts in some Dean & Deluca shops. Look: without a doubt these are the best doughnuts I've have had- in New York, in the US, in the world.  I've tried places like Glazed & Confused and Doughnut Vault in Chicago- which are awesome too, but nothing holds up consistently than the Doughnut Plant. You get a choice of cake and yeast doughnuts here in addition to doughnut seeds (which are these little balls of dough filled with creative creams and jellies. Most famous is the creme brûlée doughnut which has a caramelized outer shell with delectable custard filling than even the most discerning French pastry chef couldn't deny!In the assortment of cake and yeast doughnuts you'll find some unique flavours not found at standard doughnut joints. Even better are the seasonal doughnuts that change, get this, with the season. At moment, you can find some Japanese inspired doughnuts like Yuzu (in both cake and yeast) as well as Black Sesame. If you live in NYC, then I don't have to convince you. Chances are you already know and visit the Doughnut Plant.  If you're visiting the city- make this a stop. You will not regret it. P.S.  this place makes one of the most authentic tasting chai.  And believe me, having had chai at home, in Toronto, in India and everywhere else that purports to make this Indian version of tea, the folks at Doughnut Plant make it right."}, {"review_id": "1aaE9hsDsSiBAcFEMtNKqQ", "user_id": "O6S378a_1n0vbmBvl0M2qQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Jfc these are the best donuts I've ever had.

It's a somewhat heavy donut but well worth it! The tres leches donut didn't exceed my expectations but it was still good. I expected it to be more moist and sweet than it was. There were bites that were more moist but I expected that throughout the donut.Side note, there isn't much indoor seating so this isn't great for large groups.

This one was pretty filling on its own, so it's a good choice to share. The second donut we tried was the carrot cake, although I was hesitent because it seemed to ordinary, it was actually really good.The last one was the limited edition Christmas tree donut, so pretty and insta worthy.
