We didn't make reservations didn't even think about it since it was last minute.  The place was packed. We were told it was a 35 minute wait. We waited 40 minutes then went to the desk to see how much longer.  We were told they couldn't give us an estimated time since this restaurant seats reservations first. I kindly said you told us 35 minutes and we have been waiting.  The hostess found us a table and we were seated. The food was so good and worth the wait. I had the hand cut ribeye and it was cooked to perfection. My picture looks dark but believe me it was juicy and tender at a medium temperature. The baked potato was almost as large as my steak. The potato was also cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this restaurant but not without reservations."}, {"review_id": "kDR5ad9U49f9AFg9YAbPaA", "user_id": "k59WKPc1P1E5rwyOHiPHuQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Oddly really cold in bar area.  Warm outside.  Jackets are on.  Bar-back is turning the air off.   Nice bar selection for wine and beer.  They like old music. There is a 'select menu' and their 'usual'.  I had crab crusted chicken.  It was too .Peeled it all back.  Underneath the crust the chicken was perfecto.  Asparagus very good. The sweet potatoes fries were about perfect.  If I didn't have to listen to the oldies I might believe I'm somewhere pretty awesome. Good size servings.

Today we decided to take them downtown for a change as the reviews were great. The ambiance is quaint, the service is great and food is superb!! At first, the assumption is that the menu would be a steak house menu but alas, there was not only steak (which was superb - the executive lunch special came with grilled asparagus and a wedge salad AND a perfect filet) but there was a fried green tomato burger, fried chicken and gumbo. It was so diverse and so amazing! It'll be a go to for us for certain... especially because I forgot to grab some of the cool Wyoming pillow mints at the hostess stand!"}, {"review_id": "wVJZBHL-d6PAFoSBDvs2dQ", "user_id": "bT2fpSRrrjZX_aIABDXkUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Best steakhouse in town probably.

The only thing that was as good as expected was the green tomato appetizer. The sea bass was kind of dry with tiny bones. The filet had great flavor but not great texture. The ribs were not as large as expected and one half was very dry and the top was too charred. The silk pie was a good dessert. The huckleberry creme brulee was not set so it was liquid and tasted like jam. For the price it was extremely disappointing. Don't understand the high reviews."}, {"review_id": "O-wlk-biqRtWGIgfBUMg6w", "user_id": "oEqB6qGiV2K3q8g2A8rfYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/27/2017", "text": "Ribeye and a rack of ribs. Split with date. Profit.The hubs and I arrived in Wyoming in 36-degree weather, having left New Jersey a couple of days ago where it was on the cusp of a heat wave. We were tired, hungry, and looking to get our teeth into something carnivorous. So we go to Rib & Chop House. After being told it would be a 45-minute wait for a table, we opted to go into the bar area for self-seating. No fancy seating or bread basket for us. A cocktail and a glass of wine later, we were ready for our meal.The entrees did not disappoint. Ribeye was one of the most expensive entree at $28 a pop, but it was served PIPING HOT and cooked to medium-rare perfection. A really nice sear on the surface and juicy and tender on the inside. Served with some garlic mushrooms that teetered on the edge of being overly salty, it was still an incredible entree.The 24-hour marinated ribs were great. The meat easily fell off the bone with the gentle nudge of a fork, the meat was tender, moist, and not at all dry. Still, it paled in comparison to the ribeye for us, but that could just be a subjective preference. We paired this with the carrot souffle which was just sweet enough to compliment the glaze on the ribs.We were too full for dessert but appreciated the options, such as creme brulee, one of my personal favorites.Friendly service. Nice atmosphere. Does get busy. Make a reservation for larger parties if you can. Recommended."}, {"review_id": "dsVsFlrrtfZevrDdP--GbQ", "user_id": "hWDybu_KvYLSdEFzGrniTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "Yes, the ribs really are that good. And the baked potato? Five stars for that too.Rather than wait for a table in the dining area, and considering that I was dressed rather casually, I opted to take a seat at the bar. No worries, no second looks. I was next to two dudes in construction fluorescent yellow, so no one seemed to care. I landed during happy hour which meant that I got the 22 ounce draft beer for the price of the 16. Woot, this makes me happy.I chose the one pound rack of ribs, which is close to a half rack. A good portion. Very tasty and completely fall-off-the-bone. Delicious with a BBQ sauce that had a little bit of a kick to it. Yum. With it, I had the salad to start with bleu cheese. A good portion here. And for the side with dinner, I chose the baked potato. Massive potato, perfectly cooked and loaded with sour cream and butter. Absolutely excellent.After the dudes left, two ladies sat down and ordered steak sandwiches. Having seen these, I'm thinking that next time, I'll have that. A very large steak (not sliced!) on toasted garlic roll. It looked amazing. If you're here with a friend, one of you get the ribs and the other get the steak sandwich. Cut both in half and split. Definitely.Great service at the bar."}, {"review_id": "T8QLAtJYQhTDW8-MgwIuEA", "user_id": "1J01d590hEA-a87njadYLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "On a daily basis I consider driving from Denver to Cheyenne just to eat the ribs here! Came here for my birthday dinner after a long day of hiking in Rocky Mtn Natl park. I was starving. Parking was easy as there is a huge downtown garage behind the restaurant. The restaurant side was full and had a 90 minute wait for a table! Wha? Must be good then? We managed to get a seat in the bar within 5 minutes. I ordered the ribs with Idaho potato and my husband had the rib eye with mushrooms. Everything was perfection. Ribs were falling off the bone- melt in your mouth amazing. Rib eye was tender and flavorful, not too salty. The service was top notch. The bar was lively and a fun place to eat dinner. The restaurant side seemed nice but also could use some updating. Bathrooms were lovely and clean despite it being a very busy night."}, {"review_id": "JfIYa1XSih4Aq-jRoqg20w", "user_id": "t2XuJjp_h9aRn-8ANoyc_Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "If it is meat you want, meat you will get... or maybe a pasta dish... or a salad... or a salad and tator... or meat!Their Famous Filet was cooked just right with the right amount of seasoning and love. I must add, the huge potato on the side was the icing on the cake. Butter, cheeseeeeee, chives. Writing about it makes me crave it! If you are in the mood for just the potato and not meat, get the side potato, it is sure to make you full! Not only will you be full but you will crave the darn thing. Maybe you need a little more so they have what they call the \"2 Outa 3 Favorite\" where you select two out of the potato, salad, or soup! What a great option!It was so good, we went back twice! Plates you can't go wrong with, the Jambalaya, the Chicken Alfredo,  those amazing garlic mashers, the babyback ribs, the Chicken Marsala and any of the steaks. Everyone at the table left happy, full, and did I mention happy and full?Service was excellent and on the ball. Our servers were fun, interactive, welcoming, and they can write their names upside down! The only complaint out of the two nights we ate there is the second time went we sat in the room to the right as you enter. It was extremely dark and when they opened the blinds the sun was in our face. While it isn't anything they did, I think different lighting options would be a good idea in that room. Honestly, we could barely see our food, don't worry though, we found it and we ate it all!Putting the dark aside, if you are visiting or you live in Cheyenne, this place is worth a try. The establishment is clean and organized. If you don't make reservations, plan on waiting a fair amount of time. Reservations are highly encouraged.

We got the Pecan Meltaway.  It had a layer of chocolate graham, followed by homemade caramel sauce and whipped vanilla ice cream.  Topped with tons of whip cream, chocolate drizzle and pecan pieces.  It's not a pecan pie so if that's what you think this is...it's not.Our server guy was proficient. Refilled my hubby's soda at least four times.  He check on us and made sure everything was good.   The reason for two stars comes down to quality and cost of the steak.  Expensive for a mediocre cute piece of ribeye."}, {"review_id": "vxw-pl0Oc_ruApvCNa6-Fw", "user_id": "XrHdjDeQ4cRglfJ0XnvMEw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Most times I have been here I have had terrible service.

The reason for us making the trip was twofold. My wife had never been to Wyoming and I wanted to reconnect with an old friend from Army days. My friend made the reservation the day before we left because he said the restaurant was quite busy. We were greeted warmly as we entered and set closer to the door so my friend could see us when he walked in. Our waitress was Brittany and she told us the specials and took our drink order. I looked at the menu and immediately saw what I wanted. The bison ribeye cooked medium rare and the house salad and fries. My wife ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and house salad. My friend ordered the ribeye medium rare with the house salad.  The food arrived and the bison ribeye was hands down the best steak I have ever had! It was so good and tender it would have been culinary sin to put anything on it!! The house salad was fresh and crunchy with a wonderful thousand island dressing. I had a bite of my wife's chicken fried steak and it was wonderful as well. My friend sad his ribeye was very tender and tasty. We were too full for dessert so we paid our check and left. Our server Brittany was spot on with excellent service and we will ask for her to be our server next visit. Wyoming's Rib and Chophouse is our New Cheyenne favorite!"}, {"review_id": "F57JKoyPXkHUKiVdfv54wQ", "user_id": "v9OUsuJc0PfIi_tKgkh8iw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Been here twice and have had a good experience each time.  Always seems packed and the staff is very busy and hurried.
