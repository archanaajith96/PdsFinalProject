I think this could be a fun place for a group that isn't overly large and not wanting to spend a lot of money.Buy I also had the worst service of my life. I suspect that it may have been a new waitress. The place simply is not big enough to warrant being forgotten so easily, like you never came in (more than once). And if you are speaking to someone as your last interaction, you don't turn your back and start walking away before you're done talking. This was the only time in my life I recall not giving a tip at a sit-down casual dining place. All in all I have to assume it is a better place than my experience. And I am lucky that I have never had worse service than this benign experience."}, {"review_id": "eUUayTqT-YKEOEMjEEdncg", "user_id": "-u5kQutcNnqxtwi6PpV2FQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "I like trying new things. I found nothing wrong with my experience here, but I didn't personally find it a 5-star dining experience. As Yelp says, it was \"A-Ok.\" I just can't go higher than that, though.We were seated in a little area that was fashioned to look like a bamboo hut that had low stools for seating and a straw table that was shaped similar to a bongo drum. I believe it was intended to feel authentic, but the rest of the patrons smartly opted for normal tables, and I would recommend that, too. It ended up being quite complicated to eat there because we didn't order the food family style, and our two plates didn't both fit on the straw table thing. So, we both balanced our plates on our laps while eating. We had to use extra stools to put our drinks on. It was not exactly comfortable, but I guess I appreciated the experience. The service was super friendly and quite fast. Honestly, if Yelp did half stars, I would bump this to 3.5 based just on the service alone. They were really nice. Maybe Ethiopian food just isn't my thing, but I was not particularly feeling the culinary experience. The food was, as expected, mushy stuff that you pinch with a bread called injera that, if you've never had it, is sort of like a buckwheat crepe. Thinking a brown, spongy pancake that is rolled up. Also, mine was served somewhat cold. Is that normal?If you have any issues with eating with your hands or with weird food textures, this is not the place for you. I was also surprised because it ranged from very bland to quite spicy without much middle ground. My shiro was rated 1 pepper, and it would be too spicy for many, whereas my friend's rated 0 peppers was pretty bland. I also tried dessert, although it was not visually pleasing. I ordered the pani popo, which was a bread roll covered in coconut cream. It kind of looked like a brain when it came out, but once tucking in, I discovered it was delicious. Sweet, but delicious. I would recommend the shiro and pani popo to others, and I like that it is vegan.It was pricey, in my opinion. My dish was just some chickpeas mashed up with tomatoes and spices, and it was $13. My friend got carrots and string beans, without the benefit of any real spice, and it was roughly the same price. I may come back to try it again, but I can't see myself making an effort to go out of my way for it. I  will definitely seek a proper table next time, too."}, {"review_id": "9VzA9oTCLUWNoYuGiL7g_Q", "user_id": "pts0qipFjSfr3FID6n5ciw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This restaurant is one of my new favorites! A friend and I went here together not knowing what to expect, and Almaz was so friendly and helped us pick out the beef and lamb dishes. The lamb fell apart in your mouth it was so tender and the beef the same and both full of flavor. They were soooooo yummy! We also got the spiced tea and coffee which was also amazing.  If you like spice you can add hotter levels of spice, but we kept it simple.  In my opinion, Almaz made the experience so much more fun and enjoyable!

The best way to describe the bread: spongey texture unlike any other bread. The best way to describe everything else: a variety and combination of curries and thick stews that you pinch with the bread and eat in bite sizes!

The place can be hard to find, but it has a nice location in the old Flour Mill next to stores selling miscellaneous goods. The bamboo interior was lovingly decorated and I personally enjoyed the overall atmosphere. I ordered one of the lunch specials which included three different types of meats and vegetables with several soft spongy wraps. Food was piping hot fresh out of the kitchen and delicious. Although a bit on the heavy side, it is definitely healthy and worth the money. I initially thought that eating with my hands was a little odd, but after doing so, I felt it just simply added to the eye opening experience. Note: You can always ask for a utensil.  The owner was really understanding that I was in a rush that day and went out of her way to provide fantastic service!
