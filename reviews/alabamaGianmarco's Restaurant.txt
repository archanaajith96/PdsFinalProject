For a special treat, go behind the restaurant to the \"wine bar\". Much more relaxed feel but it's got plenty of bottles of wine to choose from (even more than the restaurant) and pretty much the same feel.Best date spot in Birmingham but if you go to the main restaurant you have to make reservations. If you go to \"wine bar\" in the back, either get there at 5 when it opens (be sure to have everyone in your party) grab a bottle of wine and be ready to hang for a while. If you've got a good group or a good date then that can be just as fun!"}, {"review_id": "RlThqJOxdiIPz3cBUTxB1g", "user_id": "8AFBfU1B1EJ9Ne9eDxVe3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "We have been trying to go here for a long time, but after reading reviews and understanding the restaurant is small and popular, we wanted to make reservations and I had to make my reservation 3 weeks in advance in order to get a Saturday evening time.I definitely recommend making reservations if you are dining for dinner, as we arrived just before 6pm and and nearly every table had already been seated and the bar area was packed. Everything was wonderful and I can't wait to go back.  Our server was very attentive and helpful in recommending what to order.  He also helped us choose a great, inexpensive, yet delicious wine.  We ordered calamari for an appetizer and enjoyed them.  I hate when calamari is tough or chewy and theirs is perfect.  We were seated near the kitchen so I loved seeing all the FRESH seafoods and meats in the cold case.  My husband ordered the lasagna and loved every bite!  Even though I originally planned to have pasta, our server suggested the monkfish special.  So glad I listened because it was so delicious!  It came with shrimp, fingerling potatoes, and sautéed spinach.  It was a large portion and I would not hesitate to order this again. Gianmarco's is a neighborhood gem!  They are open for lunch a few days during the week so I would like to try to pop in for a lunch since it might be easier to get in.  Can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "iZrlvR7L1QhgUwRATF5Thg", "user_id": "3mZrXEDBw4tZviWX0SDCoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "It has been a while since I have been to Gianmarco's. So I was shocked when I visited their page recently and did not have a review up yet. All that being said, my memory will be a little hazy on specifics. But you can rest assured any experience I have had here has been exceptional.Even though it has been that long of a time, I remember specifically what I got last time. They had a veal parmesan special that night and there was no way I wouldn't get it. Obviously it was outstanding if my mouth is watering thinking of this long ago memory. This is a fantastic place for a date night. Which is why I was there last. Dimly lit, great wine list, and of course, great food. The service has also been second to none. Extremely knowledgable and attentive. I will make sure and write an update much sooner after my next visit to give more details that are slipping my mind!"}, {"review_id": "xUZcSnxFQF-_fcUg00iCLw", "user_id": "3pD0s1WJv6418a4PF0ByWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Tonight was my first visit to the wine room. Several friends have told me this is a Bham MUST and, now that I've been, I certainly agree. Some say it's one of the city's best kept secrets, but, it is no secret. We arrived at 4:55 on a Friday (they open at 5) and we got the last inside table. Within minutes all the seats at the bar and the two outside tables were filled. By 5:15 it appeared there was already a lengthy wait list for the wine room. If you're a wine drinker, this is your spot, hands down. They sell bottles at retail and charge a 20 percent corkage fee. Therefore, you can spoil yourself with something fancy and pay much less than you would in the bar or restaurant or buy what you normally would  and pay a lot less. Plus, the selection is impressive; they have something for everyone! Our server did an outstanding job steering us to the perfect bottle and we enjoyed every sip.The full menu is available in the back. Regardless of what you order, I don't think you can go wrong. Tonight was my third visit, each time I ordered something very different (lasagna, red fish, pappardelle pork ragu) and they were all phenomenal. I got a chance to eye the spaghetti and meatballs tonight and I'm already thinking that's what I need  to order on my next visit. I've also heard the shrimp and grits are killer and the ribeye served with mac and cheese is undescribable, pure perfection. Perhaps I got ahead of myself.  The appetizers are also incredible, in particular the fiochhi is out of this world, as is the fresh mozzarella. I can't think of enough positive adjectives to describe this place.I'm sure the desserts are just as impressive, but there is never room. Warning, it's easy to fill up on bread because it is warm, crispy on the outside, and warm on the inside.Whether it's the dining room, bar, or wine room, if you're a fan of great food and quality service, Gianmarco's is one of Birmingham's best."}, {"review_id": "IfwQNWVOOaOhCkEvxQIY-w", "user_id": "kS2vzWZDufqinHOHkHurzA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Nice place and excellent food in Birmingham AL. Selected by our local hosts, who seem to frequently go there, it was not difficult to recognize why. Packed to the point, where chairs from adjacent tables were back to back, which really did not bother once one was installed at the table. Getting there was a slightly different issue. The food was great, wonderful appetizer plates, and good ol'fashioned Italian inspired steak and other selections. The wine list is pricey. As expected, delightful signature espresso."}, {"review_id": "N7CcsCqi-7btjlXqP0FDtA", "user_id": "U9MqqgrbZKo44vvp_q1iQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Never disappoints.

It was only our third time there as we tend to forego places where we need reservations.  Just know that it's worth the planning. The real point of this review is to rave about our waiter, Seth, who knew the menu backward and forward and must be a good cook himself because he rattled off every ingredient and step in preparation for every dish that caught our eye. When I told him I was trying to resist the specials because while good, they tend to be \"American\" flavors and that night I wanted to try one of their true Italian masterpieces, boy did he set me up. He got the kitchen to prepare for me two 1/2 dishes so I could sample both their spaghetti w/meatball and sausage and the veal tortelini in gargonzola cream sauce. Magnificent! My friend had the pork short rib and it held up to anything on the menu at Highlands or Hot & Hot. All served without the \"hurry up so I can turn this table over again\" treatment you sometimes find in other top shelf restaurants. Great dining experience."}, {"review_id": "CEMPzpOPt6bSkooGqnIB2w", "user_id": "DaWS4141pBMCgOv9DOM21w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2017", "text": "We went on Friday before the lunch service closed. The restaurant was mostly empty so we were seated right away. I know at night you probably need a reservation!I don't know what this says about me but I stinkin' love the pasta e fagioli at Olive Garden. It's just so good (the rest of their food not so much) so when I saw it on the menu here I had to try. It was okay. I'm just a loser who loves chain restaurant soup :(. GM's has penne pasta in their soup, that large of a noodle sort of threw me, and the broth is much more of a liquid. Anyway, the bread was fantastic. The soup was still good even though my expectations for fagioli are stuck on OG.I ordered the penne vodka with chicken and it was so good. SO GOOD. The sauce, the mushrooms, the tender chicken. Ah! I'm always saying Bham needs an Italian restaurant with GOOD pasta. Well here it is. It took me 12 years of living here but I finally found the best pasta. It was like going on vacation in another city and having a beautiful meal. Except we were right at home.My boyfriend was so wowed by his meal he swore we'd be back again and again. I know now why it's so hard to get a seat at night! Try for lunch.

(Can't remember the kind of fish, but it was really good.) I got the penna vodka & added chicken. The dish was very tasty & the chicken was SO tender & juicy. Only thing was, there was too much sauce. But the taste made up for it. We got the mini PB pie/cookie with cinnamon ice cream for dessert. Wow, so delicious!We will definitely be back.

It is worth to wait 40 minutes for the table outside (they don't accept reservations on them). When darkness hides the parking lot, it feels like a real Italian backyard. This time, I've ordered crisp crawfish, mussels in white wine, caprese salad and a cup of cappuccino with flourless chocolate cake for dessert. Crawfish were amazing. Too bad that is their special appetizer, so you can't order it any day you want.Mussels weren't my favorite but still good (I prefer them to be bigger and steamed). On the other hand, there was about 3 dozens of them. Quite good for an appetizer.It's hard to make bad caprese salad with good Alabama tomatoes, but I still have to say that it was delicious.And I really liked the cake. Paired with vanilla ice cream, soft but not crumbling, and with the taste of real chocolate.The only thing that was bad was my cappuccino, but waitress honestly warned me that she isn't a good barista, so I had ordered it on my own risk."}, {"review_id": "svdOVRlV8c1QHsrRjz4ACQ", "user_id": "B0HGwB6jQwJns8e90Qt90Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "I recently ate at Gianmarcos for my birthday dinner, after trying to get reservations for literally 5 years!

I had a previous favorite Italian place and that has now been replaced. Celebrated a wedding anniversary here and everything from the food to the service and atmosphere was exceptional. I definitely recommend getting a reservation for dinner beforehand as it is a smaller main dining area-unless you want to go out back to the wine bar area(which I have heard is great for walk ins). Order the Fiocchi as your appetizer-sweet and delicious. My wife had the beef brisket served with smoked greens and white peas-brisket was melt in your mouth good and the sides were amazing. I had the stuffed shells with lobster meat and ricotta cheese and in a tasty tomato sauce with sautéed spinach. Both were specials so they may not have these menu items all the time. I highly recommend listening to the specials before ordering from the regular menu as well. Overall no complaints-our waiter was very attentive but didn't bombard us all the time, which is what we liked. We had a great time-and will definitely be back. I hope to try the wine bar in the back of the restaurant when we come back."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gianmarcos-restaurant-birmingham?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
