We decided to stop before a concert in Columbus and not sure why we thought a burger and a rap concert would be a good idea but somehow it was (maybe the alcohol). LOLThese burgers are the real deal. 3/4lbs on meat on just one patty. WOAH. Each of us got a different burger ranging from: the Big TC, the \"Great 3\" Burger, and a classic bacon burger. I believe all of us also went up to loaded fries too, I mean if fries come loaded... why would you not get them that way? We were all STARVING because of the drive so I believe all of us finished our food which is a feat in itself! Only negative is the wait time which is to be expected because this has definitely turned into a novelty stop for those who have seen it on that show, and yes that included us. But there space is small and they definitely try to accommodate as quickly as possible. A positive of the wait: FREE POPCORN in the main entrance! Cheers to freshly popped popcorn.Overall would I visit this place again, YES! It's so fun just seeing all the burger combinations and also just the SIZE of them all is mind-blowing. Next time you're in Columbus stop by this burger joint. You won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "HwgkCH7fF6ePTY0h7YRT2Q", "user_id": "VzF4VA9vSmE8jY3n0zr8qA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "I have finally made it to Truman's after years of wanting to go! It was not what I was expecting but good for the most part. When you walk in there is a lounge type waiting area where you can hang out with a drink while you wait for your table. This is a pretty cool dive bar with old pictures, dollar bills and signs all over the walls. The music was 00's hard rap that was played very loudly. The music depends on whoever pays for the songs on the pay-to-play boom box so you can get a variety. The restaurant was busy on a Wednesday night but hey, good for them! We got some beers and 15 minutes later our table. The service here is different : all the servers take care of all the patrons. While this may seem like a good thing, my roommate didn't get her water at all after asking 3 different servers and drank mine instead. They also didn't bring one of our drinks and forgot condiments. Service definitely lacked the whole night.I got the Thurman burger and it was huge and delicious. The beef was awesome, a really good burger. My problem with it was it was so big you have to use a fork & knife to eat it. I mean there is no way that thing is fitting in your mouth unless you take parts of the burger out. I have never eaten a burger with a fork and I didn't like that. Either way, this was such a cool and delicious experience. Great place for a burger, even if you have to eat it with a fork but good luck with the music and service."}, {"review_id": "JyZ2lXT-e8sjDaiKc5vSRw", "user_id": "D21xSsUM2U_nADezstAefg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "New in town and looking for the best burger in town and Thurman's was suggested on Yelp.  I got the Jaegar Burger...it was good...but didn't knock my socks off.  I did like all the different burger options so I will be back to try more.  We did have to wait and it is a small place so if you are claustrophobic...prob not for you.I'm a fan because of the experience we had here.  We got seated at the bar and it was great!

I went and I can say that reputation is well deserved, the burgers were huge. I had to tackle the famed Thurmanator. I could only get half down and a couple fries. My eyes were definitely bigger then my stomach. Not only was the burger big is size, but it was matched in how big the taste was. It was very delicious. I would definitely go back. Service was ok. My drinks were refilled in a timely manner. However it takes so time to get your food. So if you are starving you might need and appetizer. The restaurant was dark and dim, and had a lot of things on the walls. Which helped it give the \"hole in the wall\" feeling, which I think they are going for. Perfect place to go with friends, family or date. Just be prepared to be full."}, {"review_id": "e181cE_iCeBqnlz1GmGw6w", "user_id": "PvBmRN4suldo06Kcz2-vcw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Love the dive bar atmosphere.Blue cheese burger asked for rare, it was pretty raw.  But tasty though.  My friend got scared so he didn't eat all of it, lol.Fries with gravyFull wings with many choice of sauces Coney dog was Luke warm Pizza rolls was an egg roll?  Was excited for the burger, maybe medium could of tasted the meat better.  Next time.  Other dishes were just subpar, safe, thought it would be more durty and  contain fatty filled flavors."}, {"review_id": "adRm8IAPCZ9kKGuvz9myWw", "user_id": "6lTjBc1R9Vdxi0jdcHVsDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "It truly lives up to the hype, great little joint with a great staff on hand.

Wowza!The crazy vibe will keep you entertained and chatting while you wait. Dollar bills on the walls, bar, everywhere.We were a party of 3 and with an order of cheesy( real cheddar) bacon( honest real bacon) fries.And a plate of onion straws we were ready to roll out before our food came.buffalo chicken sandwich was a real hitMy TC burger was yummy, a well seasoned burger ordered medium well was still extremely moist, topped with cheese, raw onion, lettuce, special sauce, and served on delicious Texas toast.Ok do my husband had no idea what he was getting into when he ordered the Thurman Burger an 8-10\" tall burger.Toppings include, 3 types of cheese, ham, sautéed mushrooms, sautéed onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and all on a soft wheat bun.  Well he took one look and his eyes popped out if his head. He gave it his best shot but let's just say some came home with him.Our only complaint was re: the fries. They were actually sort of soggy/mushy.The cheese and bacon made up for that, but they would have been better had they been crispy. They were hand cut fries which we loved, just again better had they been crispy."}, {"review_id": "akyB91fTjdiFjGdgTjfOqA", "user_id": "h5EHAj4CKcxaHFPExSDP6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "This place is very nice, very cool and laid back.

I came in with high expectations - so many locals claim Thurman's burgers to be the best burgers - and equal level of trepidation. But I have to say, there was no reason for the latter! Thurman easily falls into my top 5 burger place. I ordered the Bleu Cheese Burger and added bacon, mushrooms and jalapeno bottle caps. First of all, this is big enough for two people, and there was no way I could even take a whole bite, given the gigantic size of it. But even when consuming it piecemeal, I was awestruck by the quality of the beef and the marriage of all the flavors to create a delicious burger. The creamy mozzarella encapsulated the salty and pungent bleu cheese, while the bacon added that salty and smokiness, with the mushroom balancing it out with the earthy notes. Then if you add the jalapeno, there it is! A perfect burger with that last necessary flavor of spicy. Even though I ate about 110% of my stomach capacity (i.e. half the burger), I felt the lightest I felt after eating a burger and did not get the meat sweats after. I would return wholeheartedly the next time I am in Columbus!"}, {"review_id": "l3SpxmOB-pZLCyflxV9s3w", "user_id": "JW3s9ywVjPb_TJg_WjyT6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Hard to believe there's anyone who hasn't heard of this place.

I cant count how many years I have been going to this C'bus landmark. If you want to be a burger connoisseur, this is the holy grail for such status. Been there many times, and these are simply the best burgers in C'bus, period. Whopping large patties cooked the way you want, piled high with all the toppings. You can also pick one of their custom creations. I am partial to the Johnny Burger, which is a bleu cheese burger with loads of bacon, horseradish cheese, and a splash of tequila cooked in. Thats right, tequila!.However, their clam to fame is their The Thurmanator Check it, bottom bun, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, banana peppers, 12 ounce burger, bacon, cheddar, another 12 ounce burger, sautéed mushrooms & onions, ham, mozzarella & American cheese, top bun served with fries and a pickle spear! This is the one that put drove them to glory!The pizza and subs are actually pretty good too.The building itself is rather old, and the dinning area is small. It has an old school full service bar, that is fitting for the German Village area. Parking can be an issue...on street only, but a couple circles around the block is usually all it takes.Now this place is busy. There is almost always a wait, so if too stuffy to grab a beer and wait in the large waiting area, this place is not for you. Theres a reason they are so busy. And the critics who say they should convert the waiting area into seating, wont work. The kitchen is land locked, and the seasoned grill is only so big, so it would not manifest faster/more service.Final note, if your doing kids or family, be advised...this place turns more into a bar in the later evening hours, as it is a known watering hole for the area."}, {"review_id": "FCZLfeTy86pVxOrIFHFlnQ", "user_id": "q37rEMHKQs0WcpvmIrUM1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "Massive, tasty burgers!

I get it that they're famous for these big burgers, but it was just not for me. The medium well was burnt and really salty. I got the jack cheese and my fiancé got the rad shroom burger. We somehow managed to finish both burgers and felt pretty gross for hours after consuming this monster of a burger.The interior might be for some people, but it wasn't my thing. The ketchup bottle clearly hadn't been cleaned in a while and had dried ketchup dripping down the spout. We also got the fries. I wouldn't recommend them. Although crunchy on the outside, the cut was too big and they were too dry inside.

Fries are fresh cut, great flavor; good onion rings and  fried pickles as well. Oh, and you should try the breakfast fries! It is definitely a cozy place as it's not real big.
