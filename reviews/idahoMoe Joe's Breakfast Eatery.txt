When my wife confronted the server he lied and said he was \"buzzing us\", we never recieved their \"buzz\" eventhough we were sitting in the lobby.

Once I got in, place was packed for a Wednesday and waited for someone to greet me. The wait wasn't too bad, 10 min. Once I got seated, I was greeted, I kind of felt like I was being rushed as I got my menu and was asked if I was ready to order before I even looked. Once I ordered I kind just did some observations, my waitress never came back to see how I was doin until my food got to me. I noticed this one waitress kept goin to her tables and it seemed like she had more tables than my waitress. I thought she did a wonderful job and being engaged with her customers. I order the country fried steak with the potatoes. Also a side of bacon and wheat toast. Toast was really good and loved that they had fresh jam, two different types as a matter of fact. One was sweeter than the other, can't remember which one. The bacon was crispy but I wish it was thicker and tasted more burnt. The potatoes was my most disappointing part was that it was fried and I was hoping for more of a roasted breakfast feel for potatoes. I should of just got hash browns instead. My country fried steak was pretty good especially with the gravy. I wouldn't mind ordering that again. I also got orange juice and it was really sweet. Really surprising that it was so sweet but good. Kind of weird to me this place felt hidden since it is almost right across from the griddle. I would try this again and try something different. One thing is, you won't be leaving this place hungry so bring an appetite!"}, {"review_id": "Ly-G7tYtvL7_rPsXetQCtQ", "user_id": "tXa7mPa74xDZU3J6VjkYtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "This is my favorite breakfast place. They have by far the best mimosas in the treasure valley. This is the one place where I actually get factory potatoes instead of hash browns, because they're not bland, they are crisp and have just the right amount of seasoning. My favorite meal was the maple bacon fried chicken, but alas it is no longer an option (bring it back). I settled instead this time for the chicken fried steak. The biscuits and gravy is also a classic here. My last server was fantastic, wish I remembered her name. She was very prompt in her service and more importantly she seemed like she actually was excited that we were her customers.

There is no right or wrong answer, and mine just depends. If I am traveling then I will probably only visit the establishment once and therefore the first impression it is. However, with this establishment I had high hopes. The many positive reviews and photos convinced me th that this place is going to be epically good. Well, I didn't get that. Visit number one-- I was excited to eat here. I am a food guy and like good portions. The inside was small and everyone is rather close together-- ok, cool, no biggie-- I won't fault them for that. The food though was nothing like I saw, read, or imagined. So, I left there thinking there is no way that this place is bad. Too many people like this place. It's got to be a one off-- I have to go again. Visit number two-- the same as visit number one, but this time I got bad service, too. It actually got worse. Visit number three-- I have to write a review at this time. This place is just OK. To me, nothing too special. I tend to trend with other peoples thoughts on places, but this place didn't do it for me. I will go a 4th time one day, not in the near future, because I see potential and I really want this place to be what the reviews and photos show."}, {"review_id": "W5ethIMsDJht4PBEByveJA", "user_id": "yH7Sg5zMDpOYTGoS-I63XA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Good option if you're looking for a local, casual café.  The service is friendly and the food is a step up from the big chain restaurants.  The menu is also a bit more creative than the standard breakfast faire.  I felt like they don't put a lot of emphasis on the décor.  If they work to make the environment more comfortable, new and inviting, as well as increase the boldness of their flavors, they could be excellent."}, {"review_id": "W0gnrmUsmIboNEjDwamzmw", "user_id": "p78NySZ_oRl3BXqjGPK9bA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Met a buddy for breakfast 9:30 AM Friday morning.  Was able to slip in and grab the last available table and within minutes people were waiting inside and outside, at least a dozen.  If people are willing to wait outside in 20+ degree weather this place must be good...

Here are some additional points I'd like to touch on, this is just an addition to my initial review.I said it before, I'll say it again, this place gets PACKED on weekends. They actually don't allow reservations anymore on the weekend (could be viewed as good or bad, up to you). We (party of 2) came at 11AM on a Sunday, got put on the list, and actually sat down at 12:00PM (60 minute wait). This was just for 2 PEOPLE! Ordered food at 12:05 PM, received it at 12:35 PM (30 minute wait). I wouldn't have been as upset as I was if it wasn't for the fact that a party of 4 sat next to us 5 minutes after we sat down, and they got all their food prior to us. Apparently Moe Joe's is actively trying to expand their operations and get a bigger restaurant, so the wait issue should be resolved sometime in the future, but I'm still taking a star away for this.If you're planning on eating here on the weekend, I'd say come here after 12. They close at 2PM, and from both the times we've visited this place, right after 12 is when all the tables are cleared up and there is literally no wait.Food was just as good the second time around as it was the first. If you're ordering a breakfast meal that comes with toast, I'd HIGHLY recommend substituting the toast and paying an extra $2 for their Cinnamon Roll French toast side. TRUST ME ON THIS ONE. You can also substitute the toast and pay an extra $1 for a pancake, which was also very tasty actually, but that French toast side is just unreal. I included all pictures of the food (meals, French toast side, pancake, etc) for reference. INITIAL REVIEW (1st Visit): This place gets SUPER packed in the morning on the weekends. We came here on a Sunday around 12:30, and only had about a 10 minute wait. Inside is a little small, but feels cozy and modern. Good lighting, especially if you sit next to the front windows. Can get a little loud at times, just depends if there are a lot of kids eating.Their menu is very unique, and has lots of breakfast choices. Since this was our first time, we decided to get The Smokehouse Hash and Garden Hash. Both were VERY tasty, and super fresh (Garden Hash especially). The portions were just right, I have a very high metabolism and can usually just keep on going on food, but after eating The Smokehouse Hash, I felt just right. I also ordered a side order of fruit, and it was fresh as well. It's a good dessert option in my opinion, but it didn't look as good as someone else's fruit cup that they posted a picture of on here. Mine didn't have the melons, or as much blueberries.There's plenty of parking here (it's kind of in a business / strip mall type of area where there's shared parking between the businesses). Service was good, no complaints really.I feel like this place is very unique, in terms of the food and the way it's presented. I REALLY enjoyed this place. Although Steve's Cafe will always have a place in my heart, I feel like Moe Joe's is tastier / healthier. You do get a better bang for buck at Steve's Cafe (they really give you a lot of food), but Moe Joe's really is something special. 5 stars EASY & YOU BETTER BELIEVE I'M COMING BACK HERE..."}, {"review_id": "QAH2DeJRULd0BFswHwS_-w", "user_id": "scwBw7cnOSeZdt32ze1B4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/1/2018", "text": "This was such a fun relaxing atmosphere, I'm traveling from out of town and it made me feel like I was in a home town cafe with big plate options, I got the loaded hashbrowns and it was incredible!
