I get my phone out and quickly search Thai food in my area. I see that this restaurant has good rating. Honestly I wouldn't even drive down another mile, if I did I would pass out. The first thing I notice as I walk in the restaurant is the old and blackened carpet, so I think to myself \"oh no! They must have old silverware\". As my I am counting down the minutes and am eagerly waiting for my silverware to arrive (only for the sole purpose of inspecting it, not that I need the silverware to eat or anything) a nice girl named Tawnee attends me. She is very polite and attentive. I order the Tom Kah Soup, fried rice with peanuts and the famous Thai tea. Here comes the silverware, ancient and beat up as I suspected it (it could always be worse). First I get water and the Thai tea. The tea is amazing. Not so sweet but just the right taste. Fried rice is full of flavor and it is amazing with peanuts (peanuts is fine). The Tom Kah Soup is bold in flavor and it is exploding in my mouth. It is amazing, fireworks are in the horizon. Overall the experience was good. Tawnee is still the attentive person she was when I first came in. I will definitely come back, maybe they will have new silverware and a new carpet, if not I can trace my steps to where I last enjoyed my meal.

My husband and I have eaten here many times and it was always delicious. I have to say that tonight the stellar service I've been accustomed to was nowhere.I ordered my family's food to go and. I ordered the PAD THAI which is my favorite, unfortunately it was inedible because it was so incredibly spicy (I was sweating profusely it was so hot). I even used their 1-10 heat system, 1 being the least hot and 10 the hottest. I asked for a 3 figuring it would be a mild/low medium. When I got home and tried it, it tasted like an 8! No over-exaggeration here folks, it was really that HOT! When I called them to see if they could do anything for me (ie. bring me a different one or take my name and comp me next time) the woman who answered said that her boss never gave free food and I would have to bring it back to them if i wanted it fixed. Side note: The woman also flushed a toilet as I was speaking to her and I didn't hear a faucet post-flush either. I said okay thank you and hung up. I will not be dining at this establishment anymore. Badly done Krung Thai, customer service was MIA and eek health department alert!!"}, {"review_id": "cedPb1Hnq_UlCqYuBA5F_w", "user_id": "WE8FwS0qxf9PMqddkar3zA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/11/2017", "text": "This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is some of the freshest sushi I've had in all of the Treasure Valley. Why it took me so long to try this place I can't explain.I've only been for lunch, and have only ordered take out. They have great lunch specials and a very extensive menu of both Thai and sushi. My go-to order has become the Sushi Lunch Special, which is your choice of one of their Thai lunch specials, a piece of salmon and tuna nigiri and four pieces of a small roll. Cost $11.95. I order the Green Curry with chicken and for the roll either a spicy salmon or spicy tuna roll. I have ordered the California roll in the past, but it's wasn't my favorite because it was mostly rice and seaweed paper wrapped around a big chuck of Krab. And the Thai lunch specials come with a crispy spring roll,Customer service is very friendly and when I place and pick up my order they are very quick. From the small amount of time I've spent picking up my order the restaurant looks clean and inviting. One of these days I will dine in. They have a huge menu, which I think will be hard to choose from but I'm willing to try!"}, {"review_id": "nBQ2JEZXBucn9-kxFV55EQ", "user_id": "4FPK-sdVw7pgXxEfBUGawg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Atmosphere was nice enough.

Kimber says the Pad Thai tasted like ketchup... waaat???I taste the tamarind sauce and sugar that the recipe calls for. Just ask them to go light on the sugar if you don't like sweet.I am SO glad I ignored lame reviews and came here. The Tom Yum was amazing and perfectly spicy/sour unlike the Tom Yum at JP Thailand Express (not sure if JPs is from a different region of Thailand that uses different flavors or if they are catering to their mostly Caucasian patrons.)The Thai Iced Tea was delicious and generous (see my pic - I used a fork for scale)Service was great. Food was hot and fresh and pretty quick.I just moved here a couple of months ago from SoCal (don't hate, Idahoans) where there is an abundance of restaurants from all over the world. I have had Thai food at many restaurants. This is maybe the best Thai food I have had.My only complaint is that they keep the place a bit chilly for the middle of December. Almost everyone i saw was wearing their jackets inside. So, it wasn't just me ;)Ignore the nay sayers and come try Krung Thai for yourselves!"}, {"review_id": "ZogGntt9XKxHow9Iqgz0TQ", "user_id": "2kBdTIJSqJNpD0THPqeohA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "Sick at home.

It took me a while to check it out but I'm glad I did. After several bad sushi experiences at other restaurants in Nampa, I determined to see if Krung Thai could come to the rescue. I got two rolls, kind of pricey, but they were entirely quality. The previous two places had a mystery filling in the sushi. None of that here-they were full of fresh, real ingredients. Plus, the Thai iced tea was AMAZING. I couldn't believe how good everything was."}, {"review_id": "tEm3YVp_cGeD4sqnlMHMNw", "user_id": "_kYUwSSFQWpgrGf4tfVR6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2017", "text": "Amazing Thai food, the best and most authentic we've tried in the valley!  They served real lychee's, we have only experienced those in Thailand.  Loved the pad Thai, husband tried the honey walnut shrimp and had to finish dessert off with mango sticky rice and coconut ice cream!  Definitely one of our new favorite go to places!"}, {"review_id": "55SxXm50Maa_4O4y5jFeRw", "user_id": "OnlFMxbpy-cJCd4W5Z12lw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/4/2017", "text": "We ordered take out from here on a Friday night and we're glad we did. Is it the best Thai food ive ever had? No. But honestly the best I've had in the area and I've tried most of them. We got the basil chicken, asparagus chicken, garlic black pepper prawns, and some sushi and we were really impressed with the flavor of all of it. The sushi tastes fresh and I cannot say enough good about the flavor of those prawns. They didn't skimp on portion sizes which is always appreciated and I really liked the fact that they had healthier options (i.e. The white meat chicken and asparagus and the option of brown and red rice). Delivery took about an hour and a half but it was a weekend and it's one of the only places in Nampa that delivers so I wasn't surprised. Overall a great choice for Thai food in Nampa!"}, {"review_id": "RlW73q_oC1HC7EUZaZ9G7w", "user_id": "9AbhbPEHefuPPhwmZzM8SA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "Best Thai food in Idaho probably.

There are other places for sushi, but this place is probably going to be as good as it gets. If I want really really good sushi, well, I have to go to Boise to Kyotos...that is not going to happen on a Sunday at noon.     I really love the environment. The moment you step in it does seem a little sketchy because it smells like there is a gas leak. Maybe they have durian fruit? I am not sure, but I know past the smell this place makes me happy when I am having a crappy day.      The environment is really cool. You basically dive into a completely different culture. Hindu gods adorn the walls and they have a couple of miniature statues behind the cash register where you can see they lovingly place some offerings like food and money. In the middle of the lobby area there is a pond where a goddess stands to silently greet you. You know I am already in love with the place.     I like the sushi. My favorite rolls are the spider roll and the Philli Roll. Sometimes I will try the other rolls, but I stick to my favorites.     If you are in the mood for some Thai I think you will be in for a treat. I tried the soup and it is a delight. I tried some dish with peanut sauce that was to die for. I was especially fond of the Jasmine rice. I never tried it before coming to here and I am addicted to it.      Oh, and you should totally try the desert. They make their own ice cream! I ordered the coconut ice cream. This is the best ice cream in the state of Idaho! My tongue went to heaven...no joke. There is coconut in the ice cream and it is topped with peanuts and I think honey.      I did try a couple of things that I probably will not try again. I tried the tea that has this orange color. It is overwhelmingly sweet. I am not too fond of the fried ice cream. The fried ice cream seems like it has this thick sponge around it and I dislike it.*UPDATE* I tried their coconut ice cream and I am so addicted! They make their own ice cream and it is perfect. The coconut ice cream is creamy and full of coconut shavings. It is covered with peanuts and I think they use honey to top it off. It is heaven!"}, {"review_id": "r9gBNzsUfZzHIM820YC_wg", "user_id": "vDoygltA3bXZSIJhIUlifA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/6/2015", "text": "The sushi bar is what we came for and now what we will continue to come for.
