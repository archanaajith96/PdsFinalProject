I am so happy that I got to try this place before I left!There was a vast selection of homemade soups at the counter. I knew I liked corn and I knew I liked bacon, so I instantly knew I had to sample the corn and bacon chowder. It was amazing, so I proceeded to order a regular sized bowl of corn and bacon chowder with a slice of beer bread for lunch. The ladies behind the counter were friendly and made us feel welcomed. The soup I selected was extremely hearty with lots of homey ingredients. It was chunky, creamy, flavorful, and filling, and also perfect to eat on a cold, rainy day. Beer bread, on the other hand, was excellent. I've never even heard of beer bread before, so I was super intrigued with the fact that this carb-y goodness was made with beer. The beer bread was warm, soft, lightly sweetened, and tasted extra good with some butter.Overall, I was so pleased by my experience at Soulful Soups and can't wait to come back if I ever visit again. My coworker was equally happy with the food and will be bringing her bf next week since she's a Spokane local. I highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "cy5YwuFRq9cSQriInswPfQ", "user_id": "WKp-NvklJp8o0uvuDGrmWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Love this place for lunch. Pretty much the only place to get soup. The salads are good, they use spring mix, none of that garbage romaine or lettuce stuff. There are many good soups, maybe could consider a revision on a couple, but that is just me. The beer bread made by them is a nice treat if you are real hungry. It is nice to have 6 or more soup choices, and I can get one with actual vegetables in it, not just tomatoes and cauliflower. What kills me however is that after an undefined time it switches to casual dining. I avoid this as much as possible, as walking up to the line and ordering is valuable enough that it is worth one of the stars I gave it. I would even go in later at night if it stayed that way. Maybe it is a complication of city size, dont know, dont care, I go when it is line ordering."}, {"review_id": "WDbpTPTSxyQ8QVy-O2tEIA", "user_id": "WT2dNEodFZtISzRPBBtqZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "For the longest time my girlfriend was trying to get me to go to Soulful. I don't know why I never wanted to go, but I just didn't. I went, and it was such a bittersweet moment-- I had excellent soup and drinks, but I felt bad I didn't go sooner. Soulful Soups may have soup, but they're really known for their bread. That beer bread is something else... they should change the name to Soulful Soups and really good bread and Spirits."}, {"review_id": "tj-bmPa84XySQnGO0eyC2Q", "user_id": "fZmhzLVEpQZxmRE-RkEFxw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "Whenever I find myself in Spokane, I make it a point to come here for lunch.  Amazing soups that have yet to disappoint me.  On a cold or rainy day, there's nothing better.One of my favorites is the cheddar chicken soup.  Thick, cheesy and slightly spicy, with big chunks of chicken and veggies.  A dollop of sour cream that adds a cold creaminess to the hot spiciness. Matches perfectly with the beer bread,As a soup lunch place, I'd give Soulful Soups and Spirits a very solid 4 stars.  But what bumps this place up to a 5 star rating for me... is the beer bread.  It's a contender for the best beer bread I've had.  Moist, sweet, and tastes like beer without being bitter.  Even if you don't like beer, you will love this beer bread.  I'd recommend buying an extra slice to go with your soup, as I find one slice is only enough for about half a bowl of soup.The staff is always happy, polite, and fast.  They seem genuinely happy to work there, and the mood of the restaurant reflects it."}, {"review_id": "WFGki6tyRJTjJmJSjLRWrg", "user_id": "MsLbHsqGOuyTztxjCFeTrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "My soul was feeling hungry. We walked in to check the menu, tried some free samples of the mint pea and cauliflower delight (both vegan) we ordered a boozin black bean which Darrell says tastes like regular chili. Everything was hearty and the beer bread was amazing! Wish they had a physical menu to look at. Friendly staff.Other than that the bathroom had as nice ambience as one could expect. The location of it is in the back right in the kitchen which could be uncomfortably awkward depending on the state of one's bowels. Other than that good food for the price. My soul is fuller without residual guilt of eating crap food."}, {"review_id": "2qnR93yMacQSwFFxLBSkgA", "user_id": "U-F537mYfHtU5jKM_T8kKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Love this place!!!

With the limited seating. You may end up sharing a table. I sampled the harvest lentils a really good soup full of flavor. However I ended up with there clam chowder. The chowder is great. Has a little different flavor than most chowders and is not as thick.  The beer bread is a nice thick slice. I could have probably eaten a loaf of it. The cranberry walnut salad is really good as well."}, {"review_id": "fDxNkCrP6FQ3Fgwh8C7NOg", "user_id": "vGGmU-MZ8prhhI_J75_sHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Excellent service with a smile!

There's always new items on the menu and so far they've all been really, really good. I haven't been to their live music shows but I assume they're great as well. Also, if you bike to this restaurant you get a discount on your meal, a great incentive to get outdoors and stop for a bite! I appreciate that they offer other discounts as well. Students, military as well as *industry*! My only issue with it is that service isn't always as good as their bread.

I usually get the soup sampler with salad and bread. The beer bread is super good! I've enjoyed most of the soups I've had, although I do wish they had more healthy lighter soups though like vegetable barley or minestrone. I've also done trivia here a couple times and it was good, though not my favorite in Spokane. Good drinks too, and affordable prices.
