Its clean, the staff is polite, the place has a touch of elegance, its also modern. This is a place where you can come to a romantic dinner with your significant other. The entree was so delicious. Every bite in my mouth was so sensational. I ordered a steak and mushroom ravioli along with a glass of moscato. The creamy sauce in this dish was so good, I wish I had the recipe. It was so delicious, I used the bread and dipped the bread in the sauce for every bite. This is definitely a winner for me. I cant imagine who would have any complaints here.The lights inside are also dimmed. Its a great place. The menu has so many options, I had a had a hard time selecting one. And thats perfect. Gives me a reason to come back and try different things."}, {"review_id": "51rTfCWNHjwZKu3rD0hH8Q", "user_id": "eNc-OcrLdEKBFdw0jYv9JQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "We came to Mayo Clinic for an extended stay and stumbled upon this restaurant and so happy we did.   Big restaurant that is usually busy no matter what time or day of the week.My husband is a huge fan of the Alfredo sauce and says it's the best he's ever had. I stick with my fav Lasagna. So big, it's enough for two meals. For lunch, they have an express open, I believe, 11-2 with awesome salads, soups, pizza, calzones to go. You'll see lots of employees here grabbing their lunch. It's an amazing bargain and make sure to pick up a card so when you pick the sticker off your salad, save 10 you get one free!!Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "-hzz7hAIQtQ7FbeziBhoQw", "user_id": "c8M0S19gDm94SdN1b2k1BA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Attentive service, great pasta dishes and a fantastic caprese salad.  We will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "FlRfTY_De6rO1g6rknEyMw", "user_id": "zL_pWFM3lkVkWjAydk2oxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I have eaten at Victroria's many times over the years and it is consist my great.  This is not some high-end Northern Italian restaurant with sky high prices, but rather a beautifully done assortment of classic Italian dishes.  All are well made and tasty.  Prices are reasonable for the location and high quality of the food."}, {"review_id": "10YUW7LdIY7p08j1wcYwcg", "user_id": "XTM3INNj3liAZ-d_OcT8Dw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Very close to Mayo, well within walking distance.

Especially Italian ones. Beautiful ambiance. I started out with a house salad, we both did because she said it was a smaller plate. My eyes bugged out when I saw it. Small plate is way understated. Generous portion, loaded is more like it, and a delicious homemade blue cheese. Basil got a tortellini soup which is a broth base. I was almost too full for dinner and had about 1/4 of my veal parmesean with linguine. I was lucky I could keep it overnight in the car and have it for dinner on Monday. Basil got the veal vesuvia. We both loved it. Our server was very sweet and helpful. Basil had to try the spumoni, very rich. It's next door to a Dunkin Donuts, that I wanted to stop at but if I walked a foot to the car I'd have iced coffee."}, {"review_id": "jG2uuk87ztNldiTEPaR68Q", "user_id": "DlAyy1-9kRlX3ihnH9ENrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/25/2017", "text": "I and my husband like food from this restaurant. So, we visited here this evening again. I  ordered salad. Well good health balanced ! I recommend salad menu for ladies ! Pasta is also excellent !!! Staffs are very comfortable people. One thing that I noticed is ...when they clean table, I hope they use sanitizer for killing germ just in case. Bathroom is clean and pretty decorated . It is a very important and nice point as restaurant !"}, {"review_id": "PE71mS9U9Woeyq4oK2JZqw", "user_id": "YAe1pXDhhI2Zf87aezJe4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Excellent pizza... loaded with cheese.  Service was great.  One of the best meals we had this week."}, {"review_id": "tX_gT3vcjfrl3ik-GQrbpw", "user_id": "V81avkUE4ntH7YuJ51wtZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Visiting from out of town.

The service and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. The reason I gave it a 3 star is because we ordered a pasta with pesto sauce that was undercooked and chewy. Their veggie pizza, bread and eggplant parmigiana were great. The portion sizes are big. I liked the Minestrone soup alotOverall not a bad place for a meal, but could be better."}, {"review_id": "MKndkISmwtCuzXS4ZnPjfQ", "user_id": "X5gHglcNb-3EWZc1G-CvbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "A great authentic Italian restaurant!!

Staff is great, service is great but maybe kitchen needs a correction or maybe we just had an off night from the kitchen.

Number of times, for so many separate occasions. Always a great place to have a date, birthday celebration and of course casual hangout with friends. I generally have their eggplant Parmesan or chicken Marsala if my favorite dish Cheese Ravioli isn't available that is. Ravioli was delicious today as well. The Alfredo sauce on the side makes it awesome for me, as the marinara and Alfredo when mixed gives a terrific taste.Love the ambience and service. They are helpful, prompt and courteous. The wait is normally not as much, unless you are here on a weekend. There is parking available on street or garage. It both are paid parking. Being next to Mayo Clinic helps the place as they get a lot of crowd from out of town. You might be able to run into some celebs here and there."}, {"review_id": "VhAaFNFjtwhBlCnk0Z5zoA", "user_id": "TbbyiA7Ov1gdLKSZpqmzaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Our food was exquisite.
