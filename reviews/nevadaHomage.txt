I've tried going twice before finally getting in and couldn't because there was no parking. ((Current construction in parking lot and street parking is full often)Anyways when I finally got lucky and found a spot the place was everything I hoped. Chai was delicious and largeI definitely recommend the lemon creme brûlée. It is amazing.

Talk about missing out! I stopped by on my way home earlier today (around 2:20pm on a Saturday) after hearing a friend of mine rave about this iced tea she always orders that \"tastes just like Hot Tamales...\" And naturally, being a lifetime lover of the sweet-and-spicy confection, I just HAD to try it for myself. Welp, she didn't lie and the tea didn't disappoint! I don't think I've ever enjoyed unsweetened tea as much as I enjoyed the Orange Cinnamon Spice concoction from Homage (FYI, it's ok if you don't remember the name: the super-helpful gentleman at the front counter will know exactly what you're talking about if you ask for the \"Hot Tamale Iced Tea\"), and I'm actually a bit disappointed that I didn't order TWO (you know, one for the walk back to my car parked approximately 15 feet from the front door and one for the ride home). Side note: I was told the tea is made right next door in Sparks. So, cheers to supporting local businesses! And because I just couldn't possibly visit a *bakery* without trying SOME sort of *baked* good, I also ordered the Lemon and Berry Mascarpone Coffee Cake. The mascarpone-to-cake ratio was just right, while the lemon flavor shined through beautifully, without being overpowered by the sweeter hints of berry. I didn't get much of a traditional \"coffee cake\" impression from it, but I suppose it served more as a platform for the other flavors rather than as the star of the show. All in all, very pleased with my experience! There was no line, so I was in and out within five minutes, the service was pleasant, and the bakery itself was quaint and inviting. And yes, the Hot Tamale Iced Tea was definitely worth the trip! I'll be back for it again. And again. And probably again after that. Basically, until they stop selling this blend. *shrug*"}, {"review_id": "859pmaJxX_FpBXpxdxaXLw", "user_id": "B71oQ8iPa3Jb6VLRIZQGoQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "This place has taken a turn for the not good. I used to think Homage was one of the jewels of Reno for coffee shops and bakeries, and I would've put it as an example of how our city is progressing. But the last several times we've gone here we've been disappointed. We've gone two times at night a half hour before closing, and the crew was actively cleaning up; I saw someone else post about the ammonia smell and we agree it was really strong and probably not good to have around baked goods sitting out. Got the sense that we should eat/drink fast because the crew was raring to go home. Which I get. But if you're open, be open.Last time my wife went with a friend who said her sandwich was inedible because it tasted so bad, and then she also said her cupcake was gross. How do you mess up a cupcake? In the same visit my wife had coffee, and when she looked in her cup she found it was dirty and had to go back and ask for a clean one. A dirty cup is gross and it happens sure, but the bigger problem is when she returns the cup, there's no apology or even embarrassment. She just gets a new cup with some more coffee in it, as if that's just normal. For the prices here, everything should be pretty high standard, and those standards seem to be falling. Then there's the rules about being able to access wi fi only on certain days, and it adds up to us not coming back here for a while. When they started out you got the sense the staff really took pride in the place and wanted you to feel welcome. That sense is gone for the time being."}, {"review_id": "fA2f_GdpodoHNPDU_5JCkA", "user_id": "rFEruugBZt1T2VP0FdHJ2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Nice place to have a coffee date with your girl friends, no matter if you have an hour or a whole morning to spend, Homage is the place to be.

Fruit smoothie was eh (only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5) was hoping for a frozen fruit smoothie but it's a purée mixed with ice. I intended to give my baby a bit of it but because it wasn't fresh or frozen fruit rather a mix with lots of sugar i couldn't feed it to him. Butter croissant had many layers very flaky and yummy. The coffee cake was amazing! I see other reviews say how steep the prices are but they really seem normal to me but I do come from California. This place is worth trying.

From the repurposed old home that it is housed in to the fresh baked goodies, Homage is a welcome mid-day respite.We came today knowing that there would be a new menu and feel there are some great changes! Before, when ordering a sandwich, the automatic side was a somewhat bland salad. It did not seem like a popular side - you would often see it left behind on diners' plates. The new menu offers side options for the sandwiches, wraps and quiche at no extra cost! The choices: cup of soup du jour; carrot-parsnip fries with chipotle aioli; oven baked rosemary pomme frites with sundried tomato ketchup; or green salad. My daughter chose the corn chowder soup du jour and I had the very tasty carrot-parsnip fries. I especially loved the kick of the chipotle aioli! As my main, I chose the veggie stack sandwich. It was a little messy to eat but I don't think it's possible to neatly eat any sandwich comprised of stacked veggies! It was very tasty - I love my veggies!  My daughter ordered the oven-roasted turkey sandwich with NO turkey! She wanted the other parts of the sandwich, the contents of which made up a sandwich Homage has served in the past: basil, tart cherry preserves, and cambazola brie in pressed sourdough. We both were happy to see brie on the menu again! I also have to say how impressed I am with the young man who took our order. He was the only one out front and, despite a small crowd coming in to place orders right before lunch hour ended, remained positive, calm, polite, and professional."}, {"review_id": "91BdndvZX-z_ic6wrkOiyw", "user_id": "3hHXkggstSBywTFqTW4gJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I love this place is so homey and cozy feels like home.

Not so nice coffee lady now because no one coming to help, who does she take it out on US. 3. Now there is a line, someone comes out of back takes our order but all of the people behind us have their coffee and pastries and have left the building and we are still here after 25 minutes. 4. Handicapped access ! 5. Almost knocked to floor by customer in line because people are in a hurry and nothing is going right, no organization. The reason I gave them a 3 anyway, my coffee was perfect and so was my pastry.
