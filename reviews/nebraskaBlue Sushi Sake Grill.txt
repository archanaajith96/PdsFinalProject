The atmosphere is neat and our server did a really nice job of making sure we had what we needed and refilling our drinks. They have the best ice water, with cucumber! Overall, if you're looking for a great place to enjoy Sushi, you can't do better for my money than Blue. Parking in the Haymarket can be a pain, but it's worth it! I'd definitely recommend them!Get the Blue Balls appetizer!"}, {"review_id": "FsXIfjr_9IdO69Z3L0DVeQ", "user_id": "1pzP58PeWictHQzctMU0nQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Highlight: Iguana rollThe Iguana $13/6 pieces - Shrimp tempura, crab mix, fresh water eel, avocado, serrano, yellow soy paper, cucumber wrap, ponzu, and eel sauce.

The price is about what you'd expect, a little more than most for what you get. Happy hour is obviously better. The space is loud, bustling and youthful. The service is overall good but the biggest issue I have with them is...they served our daughter a pricey non-alcoholic drink with a long black hair in it. After we sent it back, we watched the manager pour it into a clean glass after removing the hair. We then told them we saw him do it while our server watched him and to remake it. That's unacceptable. And come on, we were sitting at the bar. Did they really think we wouldn't see them re-serve a contaminated hairy drink? It makes me wonder what they are practicing behind closed doors if they are willing to do that in front of our faces. Yikes. Glad we were eating from the sushi bar and not eating yakitori or any fried dishes. Not so sure I trust them now."}, {"review_id": "83vIOxepHyjk1dT9_VERww", "user_id": "RJoqNH3PVJ0Nmy6hE57sTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This place was awesome.

The only reason I don't give it all five stars is that I believe Grey Whale Sushi delivers better quality fish. Blue tends more towards the Americanized version of sushi rolls that rely more on cream cheese, sweet sauces, and crab. All of the rolls I have tried have great flavor (favorites include the Godzilla, Pretty in Pink, Alaska) and of the two spots, Blue is definitely the better spot if you are looking for a trendier place to go out in the evening."}, {"review_id": "ycoVCQa1-E60ESLeLW_k5g", "user_id": "vWvvSBQaSbyed7IGESCs0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Before they opened we had to drive to Omaha for great sushi.

The food is amazing and drinks are great. Hostesses are always very friendly, which I like because being treated wellWhen you walk in the door is important to me. 90% or the time we sit at the bar (not sushi bar but booze bar). I like the scene there and we've always experienced great service. The last time, the bartender (who we've had several times before and liked) was super off. Not sure why but it was a bummer. Just not as friendly and not attentive. I think perhaps just a bad night though. Will def go back.Only downsides are the seating outside is super uncomfortable. They have these tall stools and the back of them is terrible. Also, there's no real place to wait. People just kind of stare at each other in the doorway. We've brought groups of novice sushi eaters here and they've loved it. Cool decor, great staff.

However, it was falling apart. The sake roll was amazing, no complains. The edamame was salty and fresh. Very good appetizer.
