Honestly, I don't remember what me or my husband ordered.  I know was it was one of their infamous seafood dishes. The one thing that I vividly remember is that my fellow Yelpers came through correct on the reviews because the food was OFF DA' CHAIN!!! On top of that all of the staff was extremely personable and friendly and the prices were more than reasonable. I'm glad we decided to stop in grab a bite. We've already added this to our list of places to visit next time we're in Montgomery!"}, {"review_id": "Nj-KVryz4l-RBizur04ClA", "user_id": "jrL8Y9bNpWsyVFVSMGOT0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/29/2017", "text": "Wow! Not sure what those marking this place less than five stars were talking about.Started with samples of their sweet tea and \"Purple Hull\" soup. The soup was great! I thought the sweet tea was pineapple juice until the server said it was sweet tea with a secret ingredient, \"pineapple.\"The rest of the food was fantastic. We tried the Cajun Truffles, Bayou Classic and the Louis Armstrong. The place looks like a deli when you walk in. Not the type of place you would expect \"upscale\" food. Service and pricing was great too. Seriously, those with low reviews must have come on a bad day, or we just came on a really good one!"}, {"review_id": "n3uxC_RF1lb8b1aDwmIAzw", "user_id": "iV8hoH0hN_deyVt341TdLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Fantastic experience...   wonderful food.

This South Louisiana family was traveling through Montgomery and found this place highly rated on Yelp! Yelp did not disappoint... the place is in a non descript strip mall occupying an old Quiznos restaurant... I was a little worried until I walked in and smelled the goodness from the kitchen... we ordered the Louis Armstrong and Cajun Shrimp pasta! The flavors were classic French/Acadian. True Cajun food is not all about heat ... it's about complex flavors that blend effortlessly into a rich decadent experience... this place delivers. Fresh veggies, succulent gulf seafood, perfect andouille sausage and just the right amount of starch (either rice or pasta) work to create a meal worthy of your time. These guys need  to have a brick and mortar building in a major city. This place is legit! Go now!"}, {"review_id": "j4MnLhkOQ6MEVY7iiEtCvA", "user_id": "cSj6GQNqGyvU-4GjdeZgvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2017", "text": "The food here is flavorful and the employees are friendly!

If it wasn't for the confusing service model, or our server's mood, it would be 5 stars. Everything on the menu looks so good. My wife had the Bayou Classic and I had the burger. I wish I would have gotten something more in line with the \"Southern\" theme but the burger was stuffed with spinach and cream cheese and excellent. Her crab cakes were very good. Not over breaded and plenty of fresh meat. They topped the dish with 3 shrimp and a sauce. Only bad thing was we dined in, and after given our drinks and food no one cared to check back in with us. I didn't want to be rude and fill up my own glass from the machine if we'd be tipping someone for their time and help.

I pulled up at 8:20pm on Saturday night and reviewed the menu from my phone. I went to into the store at 8:25pm and stood behind a paying customer. When it was time for me to order the cashier said, \"hey I'm just letting you know she was our last customer for the night.\" I'm highly disappointed because I notice that the restaurant closes at 9pm. I was there 35 minutes prior to closing. So is this establishment really open until 9pm or until 8pm? Please advertise your true hours so that people won't waste their time and expectations. Or just put a lock on the door because I felt as if I was singled out to be told I wouldn't be served.....Thank you!"}, {"review_id": "3syDrbTACPbDkjDiI5AJZQ", "user_id": "atNdjjGKfR1VJ1AoZ6wq_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "The food is delicious.
