What a coffee shop. I was traveling from Atlanta to Charleston to visit the USS Yorktown. We left about 5 am and I knew I would need some delicious coffee on the way to Charleston. Everything in Atlanta was not open yet. I would have definitely stopped at Brash had it been open when we passed through downtown. Alas, I was driving caffeine less for about 2.5 hours. I am too snobby for Starbucks and almost broke down for a McDonalds drip, but then I thought about what the inside of the coffee machine may look like there, then I thought about the farmers and how coffee may be processed from McDonalds and in a flash I was determined to hope for some excellent coffee in Augusta. You never know what you are going to find when searching through the reviews on Yelp. I found a coffee shop near the interstate called Inner Bean I think? It would take minimal time and I would be back on the road in no time. Well, I also found Buona Caffe Roasted Coffee and it looked like they roasted their own beans. The pictures looked like an authentic coffee shop. They just looked like they were having fun and were passionate about coffee with their house converted to a coffee shop. I also checked their Google reviews and they were off the chart. So I also found a place called Lil Dutch Bakery shop that to me looks like they specialize in Cinnamon Rolls. Let me tell you, Cinnamon rolls have a special place in my heart. My mom makes the best, therefore every cinnamon roll I eat gets measured against my mom's from scratch cinnamon rolls.I decided I needed coffee more despite the excellent cinnamon rolls and Inner Bean coffee located conveniently within 5 minutes of the interstate. So I hit \"get directions\" for Buona and was a little nervous when Siri brought me through a neighborhood and I didn't see any signs of a coffee shop. Well, Siri came through and we pulled up to a quaint little house of coffee. I walked in and immediately scanned the area for the menu. It was on the sidewall. I think I blacked out because before I knew it I had ordered a cinnamon roll from Lil Dutch bakery, an affogato, an Ethiopian light roast pour over, a ristretto, and sampled a blend of Ethiopian and another roast. WOW! I was in coffee heaven and stayed about 45 minutes! The cinnamon roll was excellent. They warmed it up for me and it was just about as good as my moms. Perfect amount of glaze, cinnamon and not too doughy. The ristretto was my starter given to me by Carsten who I presume is the owner of Buona. He was super nice and I could tell that he was passionate about what he did. He was always smiling and joking with us while we were hanging with them. The ristretto was strong but delicious. The affogato was excellent. It is one espresso shot served over a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was so good, coffee desert breakfast! I finished the cinnamon roll off about the same time that  my Ethiopian light roast pour over was ready. Amber said that is so good that I would not need cream with it. I was like, I don't know about this but took her word for it and I was delighted to find that she was RIGHT! I typically put cream in my coffee. This one did not need it, it was so smooth and yummy. Carsten and Amber were excellent at interacting with us and keeping the drinks rolling.  Carsten made me and my son feel welcome from the start. Amber was very knowledgable about the coffee being sold there and was nice to talk to about coffee. There was a steady stream of locals coming and going. There were plenty of places to sit with outlets and wifi. There was even a wireless printer available in the seating area which I have not seen in any other coffee shop. My lasting impression of Buona Caffe is that I am in love. I wish that they were in Atlanta so I could visit more often. I will always make my best efforts to stop by on any trip through Augusta. It was so well worth the extra time added to our trip. They provided an experience that I will never forget. I purchased  12 oz of Ethiopian light roast to take home. I will be a sad boy when it runs out. Last unforgettable moment was that we got our water bottle refilled before leaving. Carsten pulled it straight from Australia! They have a pipeline to an Australian water reservoir! Amber said that most people think when you dig straight down you go to China, but it is actually Australia! lol. I love this place. Please, do not read this whole review and JUST VISIT! You will have a blast and enjoy great coffee."}, {"review_id": "YIe_7KjX24-vXBzISBd33Q", "user_id": "1nDq7vqk-RExMd2gf03j7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Paradise found.

The one thing Starbucks has done is helped people develop a taste for good coffee. This is good coffee. I had the vanilla latte and a slice of pound cake.

Probably, but I would be lying if I said anything less. I only buy my coffee beans here (Nicaraguan: Selva Negra Estate/organic, fair trade, medium roast- in case you were wondering). They bring in a quality bean and roast it locally (actually, right behind the counter if you look hard enough). Just check the roast date on any bag. It hasn't sat on a grocery aisle for months or in some facility until inventory is down. And this is only the beginning.     The lattes, the mocha, and espresso do not disappoint. But I have to take time out for my favorite, cold-brew coffee. Now just a quick point here; \"cold brew\" and \"iced\" are not interchangeable. All cold brew coffee is \"iced\", but not all iced coffee has been cold brewed. So anyway, cold-brew is amazing because of the low acidity for never having been touched by hot water and the flavors that come forth because of this process. And now they not only serve cold-brew coffee, but nitro-infused as well. If you have been inside any decent bar the last two years, you have seen this process applied to craft beers. Now you have this same increase of richness applied to coffee. So order a glass (and not to go). You can thank me later. Oh I almost forgot, Affogato is there as well.      Now yes, they have pastries and quiche and chocolate bars that use their beans. They have scones and turn overs and pound cake. They even have complimentary Wifi to go with your order (listen, some places still don't do that). I just love their coffee. They are located inside a house so you are literally right at home. Outdoor seating, with shade, is an option as well. If you want to take your home coffee game up a niche (or three) ask them how. They have grinders, brewers, and all levels of equipment available onsite. If you are a business needing coffee and/or coffee equipment they can do that too. Installation and training as well. Catering needed? Fundraiser required for your kid's soccer team? Yep, that too.    Of course the owners are two of the nicest people you will ever meet. And there's a Aussie working sometimes that knows more about coffee than one human should, plus he makes everyone feel welcome (he is also the one who teaches the cupping class). *Insider's Tip-Sign up for their e-newsletter. It is the first place to find out about their cupping classes, which fill up in a matter of hours.-When you can't decide on something, let the pour over be your go-to. It will always feel right."}, {"review_id": "JeAuk_oGspXkle678fCzrQ", "user_id": "MKm9YzRIh7C7_DANoTfzoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "The service here is always great and makes me smile.
