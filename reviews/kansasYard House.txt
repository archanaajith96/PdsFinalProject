We grabbed 2 seats at the bar, first come first served, and was in an out without a wait. Cheese curds, my favorite last words. \"How much cheese is too much cheese?\" -Charlie Day I feel you. Southern fried chicken hit the spot this last visit. We've tried everything from tacos to dips to wings to hummus - all above average goodness. Honestly, happy Hour is the best time to come. We went to dinner and dropped $70 on 4 crafts beers, 1 app & 1 entree. Seems a bit steep so we usually come for happy hour.  Bartenders will let you taste any draft you'd like. They cut me off at around 10 samples (I like beer) but we got to taste tiny bits of beers we don't see anywhere else. Love!"}, {"review_id": "IYjRbZqc5rRwaG-fV4RjSA", "user_id": "wft25WB9OOufQRs_Cpwc8Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Beer. Lots and lots of beer. If you like beer, you'll like be this place. I do not drink beer so you see where this review is headed. For starters... on a lazy, cold Saturday afternoon there was a wait. A very long wait. We were told our wait would be 50-55 minutes. At 65 minutes we started getting worried. You wait single file down a long corridor leading from outside, too. As you get closer you can inch your way to one seated bench. It seems to me that if you are going to require people to wait in line for a long time, you redecorate a bit to provide more seating for the waiters. The only positive thing about having to stand up so long was the line looked into the kitchen. You could see the food as it was being prepared.When we finally hit a seat, we felt like we had reached the promise land. The seating area was nice and modern. Everything was as comfy as it could be in such a large restaurant.  Our server was very nice and pleasant. She was professional and tended to our needs. She answered our questions thoroughly. Servers at other tables seemed very nice, as well. The food was good but it wasn't we-waited-over-an-hour good by any means. It was also pricey. I had the lobster pasta and it was lacking in something. Could not put my finger on it but it needed some other spice or taste. My friend had the fish and chips and he enjoyed them quite a bit. I also had a Caesar salad which was yummy. We had hummus as an appetizer and it tasted very good. I also thought the food was way overpriced. This place seems to be attempting to be upscale fancy pants. The prices were way to high for what you got, for how it tasted, and how long you had to wait in line.  The food was very good but I didn't think it was THAT good. I've had better for less wait time and less money.The biggest annoyance for me was the music. It was VERY LOUD. It was so loud, we could not hear the server. I kept having to play interpreter for my companion because the server could not be heard over the music. When will restaurants realize that loud music doesn't help their business? No one want to spend the night screaming at their dinner party. Everyone was friendly, food was okay, music and prices were way"}, {"review_id": "3wTiV1frTh-dffI4ssXHog", "user_id": "lWZdb9ptPIX_QTfsHafXlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Awesome happy hour menu and prices!   50% off selected menu items!   Attach are the dishes we had!  Awesome for early afternoon gathering!  Will NOT be disappointed !!"}, {"review_id": "zqQj2YsA51oMQDBsKmLiBQ", "user_id": "mpS38CQozjwcWPa231SouQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Great restaurant with nice atmosphere...the place is full so that is an indication...looking forward to coming here again...the service is great also."}, {"review_id": "xMqZ6c3oafq_2TM2J-oXKg", "user_id": "S47pX7Y3xwNoftuOlSDsug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "The menu is huge!

For a Thursday night,  there was about a 20 minute wait which wasn't a big deal. Once seated, we found a few beers to try before diving head first into a pint. Our waitress was down to earth and genuine which is always refreshing especially during the holiday season. It was challenging to get comfy as there was a continual \"wind\" of cold air ie the vent shot directly at me. That was a little bothersome but once my Vampire Tacos arrived, my mouth and body warmed up quickly. I ordered the full plate which comes with 2 tacos, rice, and pinto beans. Now don't get me wrong, the plate was delicious, but not $17 good! Either way, we enjoyed our time but this was a \"few and far between\" visit."}, {"review_id": "n4QICkg4dHlYqTH7uQ2U1A", "user_id": "A5T8ey1_3nQzopV0PcCmIQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "This used to be one of my favorite locations to visit at the legends.  It is now one of the worst.  What used to be fresh food is now packaged ingredients no better than a chain fast food restaurant.  They can get away with it because they are always busy.  Oh well, there are other restaurants near by that don't charge so much for a draft beer."}, {"review_id": "hxPHK1zpiIPtTrfTsRLpYw", "user_id": "mJL6O829y9c-I2lWlefwMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Great food and drinks.

Fortunately there were a couple spots at the bar, so we settled in there. They have a large bar with more than one bartender working it. What I liked was that they worked as a team. Some places with large bars have the bartenders working in sections, so you're waiting on one to take care of you. Not here, they both waited on us, so we never experienced any wait time on anything.The beers good and really goes without saying. There is plenty on the menu, and a bit overwhelming at first glance. I did notice that they have a fair amount of vegetarian options. We started out with two of the appetizers, and they were both a hit. The three sauces that came with the shiitake and crimini mushroom lettuce wraps were oh so good. The mushrooms were cooked perfectly as well. Next was the poke nachos. The nachos are actually crispy wontons. There were plenty, but they didn't last long, very good. For the entree we had the ahi crunchy salad. Generous portions of lightly seared ahi tuna and a really good soy vinaigrette.It was a good lunch in a good atmosphere. There are plenty of TV's to watch a game, as well as plenty of patrons if you like to people watch. They have an outdoor seating area also. We'll definitely be back, but maybe for one of their happy hours. It looks to be a pretty good deal. At regular prices, a couple brews, appetizers, and entrees can add up pretty quickly."}, {"review_id": "RIIBkbvOCWSfhnK5h09Uww", "user_id": "yu9fIXiiulj26vg3SZ_6EQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Service was fine, food was alright.

My wife got  a grilled chicken sandwich that was overcooked and dry.  She also changed her side from fries to a Kale Ceasar, which was delicious and huge for a side.  They upcharge 1$ - but for the size they give you, it's well worth it.  The salad saved them from a 1 star review. Our server was also distracted and forgetful.  We had to ask for refills, and two times for ranch for my sandwich, before I gave up and never received it.
