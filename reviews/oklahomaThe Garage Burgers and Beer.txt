The Garage is a \"let's get together\" kinda place. They serve up local favorites like burgers and fries and some lesser known  menu items like tacos and hot dogs. With all kinds of options there's bound to be something on the menu for everyone. Their traditional cheeseburger checks every box and oh, that bun-yum! They serve up baskets of fries that are great for sharing. If beef on your burger isn't your jam, they have you covered, there are lots of other \"patty\" options available, including vegan ones, too. Other notable menu items are the fish tacos, giant hot dogs & salads. My experience at The Garage Main Street Norman was plagued by cold fries which had to be sent back and giant spoon fulls of uncooked garlic at the bottom of my hot fry basket-whoops 2x. I will sure give them another try, but I won't be rushing back. From the sounds of my friend's accolades who recommended we dine here, this isn't the norm. And everyone else in the group had a great experience. At this location you order your drinks with the server at your table and walk up to order food at the designated spot at the bar. This was a unique experience for me, but seemed totally normal for the Oklahomans who brought us here. They have an awesome selection of local rotating craft draft beers which really was the saving grace from the fry debacle. Overall, I think it has charm and decent food but perhaps not deserving of the accolades the Okie's tend to bestow upon it. In every city there are spots locals adore and outsiders just don't get that into because, well, it just isn't that much of a standout. I think The Garage checks that box for me. I'll be back, for sure. If down the line I ever have that mind blowing experience here that Okie's like to rave about, I'll be sure to let you know ;-)"}, {"review_id": "M1NIDWPJ89WJ3UlQLdbTbA", "user_id": "3xzqKCX2FVpTates3NwF1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "On an annual trip to Austin through Oklahoma City (and requisite 'burbs), Yelpsearch revealed The Garage near the very top of the list for an awesome burger, which is just what we were searching for.We pulled up right outside, and lucked into a front-and-center parking spot - a good sign to start!When we got to the counter, we informed the order-takers that we were newbies, and from out of town.  Despite the pressure, the hired guns gave a great tour of the menu, and provided a couple recommendations.Being as my derriere had been planted in a car since 8:00 am that morning, I was eager to try something pretty...different.  The cashier steered me DI-RECTLY to the \"Sticky Finger\".  On top of a perfectly normal burger was the following: Peanut Butter, Bacon Bits, Sweet Jalapeño Relish, and Cheddar Cheese.  The \"Sweet Jalapeño Relish\" had me a bit on edge, but I'm DEFINITELY a peanut butter guy, so I pulled the trigger, and asked for the relish on the side.As we sat down, I perused the setting.  A cool, funky jive, reminiscent of my favorite burger dive in the state of Kansas: The Burger Stand in Lawrence.  Plenty of seating of all sorts (high tops, bar, booths and so on), TVs galore, and plenty of florescent lighting.  My travel partner and I shared an order of Garlic Parm fries, which were fantastic.  I could have used double the amount of dipping sauce, but that's my problem, not The Garage's (as per my dipping addiction).My burger was...how should I put this...the third-best burger I've ever had in my entire life.  Now, don't go thinking that third is bad.  Oh no - third on MY list is something pretty darn special.  This burger slides in right behind Hodad's in San Diego, and the aforementioned 'Stand in Lawrence.  I tried the burger without the relish first, and it was a solid A.  Then, I put a little relish on my next bite.  A+++.  Holy freaking cow. Whoever's running flavor profiles for this menu knows his or her friggin' stuff.  I dumped the remained of the relish on the rest of the burger and devoured it within 14 or 15 seconds...As soon as I cleaned myself up, and as soon as my buddy stopped laughing at me, I told him that THIS was our burger joint in OKC, and very likely, our return lunch spot next year when we drive through again.Food = 5/5Facility = 3/5Service = 4/5Ambiance = 4/5Value = 4/5"}, {"review_id": "BkTvf66UQSOWU32q71sXgw", "user_id": "G12EVINT3XhwEhvbS5Ah8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "A favorite of ours and only 1/2 mile from our house!

The place is a bit cramped and overcrowded when busy. I would give 5 stars but when the tables are so close you are bumping elbows with another random person at some other table that's not cool. I hate when restaurants try to increase capacity beyond comfort honestly it's unprofessional and overly greedy. Remove a table or 3 to spread out the dining area a bit.

It has a classic fire-grilled taste and was so juicy I needed to order extra napkins. The bun and veggies taste incredibly fresh and mayo is a great compliment to this burger. Unfortunately, I ordered \"no pickles\" and I swear they added extra pickles to my burger. Moreover, the French fries are absolutely nothing to speak of and should be substituted for the house chips. The house chips are a reason to go to the garage alone. This locale is a great venue. Although it's a sliver storefront (long and narrow), they almost always have good seating. The place is lively and offers bingo (Thursday nights) and trivia (Sunday nights) so that you can get your game on between drinks from the extremely skilled bartenders."}, {"review_id": "IynBLsCTc7RV6lascgFb3g", "user_id": "cNCkyTLjBu96nOH1P5Jd9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/22/2017", "text": "My wife and I recently headed out to Norman Oklahoma to see our extended family.

Perfect crisp on the bacon on the fries and the hot dog wrap. And although it is primarily a bar and grill the atmosphere the mid afternoon was very family oriented  Their line setup was really nice.
