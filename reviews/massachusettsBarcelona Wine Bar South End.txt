Our Boston friends suggested that we try Barcelona Wine Bar for dinner one of those nights. We tried to be proactive and made reservations the night before which was the best idea ever.  Our small party of four were helped right away where other guests were waiting (so glad we made a reservation!).When the hostess initially took us to a dining area that we didn't want, I asked to be seated at one of the booths near the bar and the host was kind enough to re-seat us (thank you).SO many delicious options for their tapas. I love the small dishes served as it really allows us to explore more of the menu.  We tried about 5-6 dishes altogether and they were all fantastic. The best part was the churros that we ordered for dessert. I mean--- YAAAAAAS!

Yes, it's tapas, so you pay a lot for a bunch of little plates. However, EVERYTHING here is delicious. The meat plates (bottom of the menu/save your stomach if you decide to order) are some of the best cooked, juiciest meat I've ever had. I think my favorite dish is actually the chickpea and spinach tapas - it has this amazing savory flavor that makes me want to actually eat vegetables. Also, DO NOT skip the croquettes - no one should miss out on those crispy balls of cheesy goodness. My chief complaint (and probably only) is that sometimes the menu can be tricky to translate. Most of the dish names are not in English so ask one of the friendly wait staff for recommendations if your Spanish is rusty like mine. Typically I would praise the wine list, but they actually have awesome cocktails here too!

Their excuse was that people were taking their time at the restaurant and not leaving. I dunno how restaurants figure out balancing reservations and walk-ins, but not being able to be seated WITH A RESERVATION until an hour later is unthinkable and a huge misstep on their part. Now, once we got seated, the staff was quite courteous and sent us several tapas on the house. This was probably Barcelona's saving grace, and the only reason this didn't turn out to be a two-star review. We ordered potatas bravas, spicy eggplant, octopus, and some type of meatball. We were given an additional order of potatas bravas, fried brussel sprouts, a cheese board, and a potato tortilla. At the time everything tasted delicious since we were starving, but looking back, the food was definitely lacking.The potatas bravas tasted were quite chunky and honestly just tasted like home fries from a breakfast diner. Octopus was way too salty and slightly over cooked, brussel sprouts and the eggplant were also quite salty, though they did have good flavor. The eggplant would have delicious mixed with a bowl of rice (sry my Asian is showing). The meatballs were only ok with flavors akin to a typical italian meatball in marinara.

Oops. Better late than never though, right?To celebrate our anniversary my boyfriend decided to bring me to Barcelona Bar -- he'd been before with a family member and had fallen in love, insisting we visit. Because it was the holiday season (January 2nd) the place was unsurprisingly busy, so we were glad we'd made a reservation. We were quickly sat in a booth near the bar and as we waited for our waitress I took in the restaurant. It has the perfect vibes for a date night or a special occasion -- lots of dim lighting and woodsy details in other words -- and was filled with attractive men and women. If you don't already have a date Barcelona Bar might actually be a solid place to find one (haha). We started with a meat & cheese board (which I can't remember the exact details of) and continued with a few cocktails and many, many, MANY tapas. Here are the ones I remember: Calamari Plancha, Spicy Eggplant Caponata, Mussels al Ajillo, Blistered Shishitos (my boyfriend orders these EVERYWHERE), Jamón & Manchego Croquettes, Albondigas, Grilled Pulpo (the highlight of the night, the octopus was crispy but tender at the same time), and Grilled Hanger Steak (another highlight). We loved everything and were both unbelievably impressed not only with the flavors and presentation of the dishes, but also the technique. The only dish I would NOT recommend is the Spicy Eggplant Caponata. It really doesn't taste spicy (at least to me) and is on the sweet side. And I swear, I'm not usually \"that person\", but the texture of this dish actually gave me goosebumps. It was cold and mushy but with enough bite to it that it lingered for far too long. Not pleasant. PS: We visited Barcelona Bar's Brookline location more recently and I personally prefer this location. While the other has more space (and better lighting) I find the South End location far more elegant and intimate, making it a better spot for dinner in my opinion. Plus, I think the service and food is just a touch better here."}, {"review_id": "eGl3mL7_pmJy2ABE7WNXWA", "user_id": "M-VleDAP8D7zeaSoVEf4UQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Finally confirmed my Yelp​ account to write an amazing review of my favorite restaurant​ on earth (not being hyperbolic).I struggle to decide what my favorite aspect of Barcelona is because it is near faultless. Between the incredible staff, the DELICIOUS food, the price point, the atmosphere, etc., it's stiff competition. I came here for the first time in the Fall as I had just moved to Boston from the UK and this hidden gem is the first place I take anyone when they visit. This place is not just for young adults, but a fantastic place for any occasion​: date night, family outing, and so on.First off: the atmosphere.Barcelona's atmosphere could not be more ideal. Whether you're going for brunch or dinner, the way the room shifts between meals is stunning. This is my favorite location for both meals because the natural sunlight coming in through the gigantic windows is refreshing and positive. They also have a DIY-Bloody Mary bar (which I have not personally checked out since it's not really for me, but my friends and family have loved it). Even if you don't drink Bloody Mary's the bar is still marvelous and should be appreciated. Next, the food:For the price, the food exceeds far beyond expectations. Perfectly sized dishes, Barcelona is fantastic at staying true to traditional tapas sizes (with twists on classic flavors). The menu is great at pointing out which dishes (i.e. the paella) are slightly bigger and not served in a tapas style. For brunch,​ one of my favorites is the FRENCH. TOAST. I am not normally a huge fan of french toasts, but the light, not-overly-eggy texture served with yogurt​ and berries is a beautiful combination.For dinner, you really can't go wrong with anything you choose. Literally,​ every single dish I have had from here has been spectacular. My favorites include the croquettes (you WILL order several, they're that delicious), the kale salad, the albondigas​ (meatballs), fried Brussel​ sprouts, etc. I could go on and on. The menu does change pretty frequently though, but the classic, popular tapas are always there.Finally, the people:I have never encountered a more pleasant, attentive staff than the people at this location. Patrick, the general manager, is one of the most genuinely kind people I have ever met, always making sure that everyone is enjoying their time. He is frequently out on the floor, engaging with customers, and it's not hard to tell that he really cares about his work. The servers are extremely knowledgeable about​ the menu (I think they do weekly, group tastings? not sure) and will be more than happy to recommend​ their own favorites. Jamie is one of the most personable and friendly waiters I have had. I always feel like I'm out with my best friend when we're seated in his section.Ultimately, you WILL have a great time if you come here, no matter what time of day. I cannot say enough positive things about this place. The only thing I would note is to make sure if you're coming for dinner on the weekends that you have a reservation; otherwise,​ you might be waiting up to an hour or two for a table!"}, {"review_id": "ub0XiTUsPIANf4IwlGrEgQ", "user_id": "kiDpVtlkNtlT6BVdOa9L1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Brings back memories! Felt liked I was in Spain again! I came here with my boyfriend and two friends. My boyfriend and I shared 5 plates of tapas. We weren't stuffed, but we weren't hungry if you know what I mean. The server recommended 2-3 plates per person. So we listened, and he's about right. The menu is seasonal so you might not get to experience the same plates we had. We had the shrimp ceviche, potato bravas, hanger steak, beef tartare, short rib, pork tenderloin, and other vegetarian dishes that our friends got. I'm not a big fan of pork so I wasn't a big fan of the tenderloin. Definitely would get the hanger steak and beef tartare. The Brussels sprouts were crispy like fries. The ceviche was good. The short rib was a little too salty and I was expecting a piece of bone marrow. But instead, it's just bone marrow sauce. The wild mushroom was flavorful and delicious. The eggplant dish was okay, but not that memorable. I can't remember the other dishes. They all looked very appetizing though.The service was attentive, we had our glasses filled more than once.

That was small potatoes compared to him responding to another friend's recommendation on a dry Chardonnay by schooling her saying \"that's the wrong way to think about Chardonnay\". If that wasn't enough, when we asked if we could get bread for the table he was very quick (and rude) to say \"bread is always offered I just haven't brought it out yet\". It is not an experience I'd return for if I didn't know this place any better but after last night I feel like I would be better off going to Brookline for my Barcelona cravings. 4 stars because the food, ambience, and quality has never disappointed in the last 5 years.

Everything I mentioned above regarding the service, the ambiance and the wine applies. But in terms of food, the experience was slightly different. Certainly not disappointing, but simply not that great.

The salsa brava was good. Not that spicy but overall it delivered a nice flavor. .- Pan con tomate: Perfect! Nothing to say here... you would expect to get a slide of bread with tomato... and I guess that technically this is what you get... but they elevate it in a way that you wouldn't expect..- Eggplant caponata: Certainly not bad but... I would say they used some sugar in the recipe and... that's so unfortunate... I would say it would be much better if they simply forget about the sugar....-  Paella de mariscos: Not bad... but not the best one ever.... The rice was properly cooked, but the paella was missing something... I am not exactly sure what it was, but it was a little bit blend... Also, even if the rice was properly cooked, it was not crispy (ideally, you want to have some crispiness when having a paella... that is one of the differences between paella and any other rice recipe). Another characteristic of paella is the \"socarrat\", that crispy part you get in the bottom of the paella... Well, that was also missing.
