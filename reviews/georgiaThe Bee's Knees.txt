We started with mimosas. They were aright, not too strong but still tasted like a mimosa. We ordered our food - I got the Chicken and Waffles and my husband got the brunch sandwich. It took a while for our food to come out, but we had our drinks and each other's company so we didn't mind. Just be prepared to wait, and order biscuits or something if your hungry in the meantime. We ordered bloody Mary's while we waited.My chicken and waffles were so good! The chicken was a good portion and the waffle fluffy. Big tip: order the gravy on the side. It was delicious but heavy and made for good dipping.My husband was disappointed in his breakfast sandwich. He said overall it was good, but the bread was so stale it crumbled with the first bite. He later described it as \"breakfast between two large croutons\". He ended up using a knife and fork to eat it and was less than satisfied.Overall, we will be back. Just prepare for a wait and pass on the breakfast sandwich, unless you like croutons for breakfast!"}, {"review_id": "74XX3lSZ0tQpVEKux0pX0A", "user_id": "x_Vo6Z1nvWgGHkHeQrLWrw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Food is great , been here three times twice for brunch and service is absolutely so slow.

Service is ok. Whole experience is rather mediocre.Came here on Sunday for brunch/lunch with some friends. We ordered a few items to share. I got the shrimp and grits for $16 a la carte, it was a very shallow  smaller plate bowl with a lot of grits and very little shrimp and other items. It tasted ok I felt like I was eating just grits. My friends ordered the steak and eggs and that was much better. The chicken waffle was over cooked and chicken was very dry. Service was ok, absent at times. Bathrooms are reasonable.

I'm starting to think people just collectively nod and murmur agreements and recycled snippets of pleasant reviews they had read on Yelp rather than gathering from their own memory when asked their opinion of a trendy spot. This review is strictly about brunch and should in no way reflect your decision on whether or not you should try their dinner menu out. Dinner is and will presumably always be a unique and enjoyable experience. But their brunch flat out sucked. And though I am an infrequent reviewer, I was so disappointed by my meal that I'm taking the time to express my frustration so perhaps I can save someone else from making the same mistake. First off, the host was confused, hurried and rude. We had an 11:00 reservation and stood in the bar area with a number of other couples to get out of the cold. Some had reservations, some didn't but it appeared they were seating whoever was standing closest to the host stand. I noticed that two other couples that had been pushed back towards the other dining room piped up that they were here first but it fell to deaf ears. I tried letting the host know that we also had confirmed reservations as he sat us and put the one menu down on the table but he gave a blank stare and tried walking away. Asking for an additional menu so we didn't have to read off the menu summoned the exact same expression.Our server however, was an absolutely joy and obviously very proud of all that Bee's Knee's has to offer. She immediately corrected our menu situation, brought us coffee and helped us navigate through the brunch menu like only a professional could. She explained the food was made to order and sometimes had items that changed on a weekly basis so if we came back, we had a variety of flavors to look forward to. We ordered the chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, and a strawberry pancake. I had been hemming and hawing about ordering chicken and waffles since my love of the two makes it my ultimate breakfast. But I have only eaten it at chicken and waffle shacks frequented in lower income neighborhoods and hole in the walls. My friends urged me to give it a shot because \"it's so amazing\" but it really fell short of being even \"meh.\" It was cold and hard and our food temperatures were all sorts of off."}, {"review_id": "a_F7skiXm4r43LIG4gtKug", "user_id": "AvnDOd3YVGxeN5U3NMC25g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "The avocado was very good, however I wasn't impressed with the other items we had.

It has a chill, artsy, rustic, trendy style to it...definitely understated and a little off of the main road. The staff was friendly and attentive! We went early in the evening so we had no issues with the timing of how the dishes came out (I've seen numerous reviews where people mention this issue). I think when you step into a place like this, you need to just slow down, take a nice deep breath and just let the world pass on by while you peruse the extensive drink list. Tonight was $5 martini night, the hubby had the Espresso martini and it was top notch. The Sangria intrigued me because it has coconut rum in it, so I ordered that. It was divine! Balanced in flavor and clean-not like places that use cheap wine, blech.The food was very good too. We had the smoked gouda nachos, a special that was mushroom/roasted peppers pizza, a waffle and chocolate torte. All well prepared, good flavors and balanced. I would eat here again and I look forward to trying the Hive!"}, {"review_id": "Adpw3iv8D6V2iQ3uXSiL8Q", "user_id": "Il-3p7UNDQ_dN_XrPhfpLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "First place I've been during my stay in Augusta and boy they did not disappoint! Our service was great (even though our server had to dip out early for a family emergency). The staff did not skip a beat in taking care of our table. We sat outside and enjoyed the warm fall weather, before heading over to the symphony downtown. My friend and I shared a few small plates which actually ended up filling us up!I had a glass of red wine, and my friend had a hot tea, they brought out a whole selection of different teas which was pretty cool. I would definitely recommend anything that has Gouda on it, and the kimchi balls are freaking amazing. The vibe inside is pretty hipster with low-lighting and an eclectic art choice. I've been told to try the sister restaurant next door called the hive as well. Hopefully I'll make it back before I make my way back up north but if you're in Augusta definitely check it out."}, {"review_id": "oJYvNTB-g7JPg8fBPA2l7w", "user_id": "JN3zelvxNhcVQupxsTd9zQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "This place would have done everyone a great favor if it just decided to identify as a vegetarian restaurant.I was on a trip to town from Central California and ended up here for dinner after i found out businesses do actually close down on Sundays around here. Disclaimer; as a Californian I'm already suffocated by all the new age alternative revival gluten free vegan farm to table non GMO range free locally produced hand picked organic soy sticks, so I really don't have much tolerance for that bs anymore. The ambiance and the setting of the place is wonderful. But that's about it! Both the food and service suck. The server said that getting a plate would take about 40 mins and a small tapas would be 15 mins. Since I don't like to eat late because that's how you get fat, I decided to order smaller plates. They took 35 mins to come to the table anyways and they were very disappointing. The spring roles felt like friend flat bread role filled with store bought cabbage. The nachos tasted very grainy.

I went several times and always took people here when visitors came into town. My visits have started to slow down in the past year and a half because the service has been so spotty and I've had to send food back and hate when that happens when you've hyped up a place to a friend. Last time I was here was for book club back in August and I thought I may not return because of the service again but I've been talking about the smoked Gouda nachos to my sister for years and really wanted her to try them. We came on Friday night around 6 and didn't make a reservation (rookie mistake, I know...) so didn't get in until about 7:15-7:20 and we were starving by that point. We ordered the fries appetizer with three different sauces: sriracha aioli (my sister said this one was her fav), peanut (my favorite because I love anything warmed up) and the creamy Parmesan. The Parmesan was a little too runny so not the best for fries, but may have been good on a different dish. We also ordered the smoked Gouda nachos with crab and shrimp and man it was good. Just what I was hoping for. My husband ordered the buffalo tempeh and I actually really liked it and the sauce it was served with. I like that they have options like this for vegetarians. Not sure I would order it again, but it was good. I had to send back the white sangria that was on special because it tasted like tanning lotion, but the waitress was really nice about it, so I appreciated that. Will I be rushing back? Probably not, but I do know that I still bring out-of-town visitors here to enjoy some great appetizers."}, {"review_id": "eeJbxiYxD7g7kCI_e9LD0w", "user_id": "4lng77gRdpRb24o91sSihA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2017", "text": "This place does not serve real bacon. L.A. isn't the only place for a pretentious brunch, as Augusta has just proven they're able to tread the same water. This spot popped up at the top of my local brunch search, and given the number of reviews and high rating it seemed like a good idea at the time. The menu is underwhelming, with only a small selection of options available, none of which jumped off the page as must-eat foodstuffs. Shrimp & grits, chicken & waffles? Meh. I can get those standards anywhere. The one egg item on there - an omelet - is made with vegetables and \"artisanal cheeses\", and they don't do substitutes. I asked if I could get an omelet with some bacon tossed in there, at which point I was told \"Sure, if you're OK with turkey bacon\". The answer to that question is always no. I decided on the chicken & waffles simply because I like to have a solid shot of protein with every meal. And waffles are awesome. Not these, though. My chicken was a 1/3 of a breast, cut to resemble a large wing. The waffle was partially soggy upon arrival. Seriously, guys, $16 for this and you can't even give me a whole breast? Time for a drink. They have a really impressive bloody mary menu, with a few options that sounded unique and tasty. My buddy & I decided to split  carafe of the boiled peanut spicy bloody mary. Given the ingredients list and my desire to drink away any memory of their bad menu, it seemed like a good bet. Except once it came out and I drank it and, geez, it just tastes like a glass of vodka and V8 juice. I mean, how in the hell can you put so much good stuff into a bloody mary and it still comes out tasting generic. Massive disappointment. At least the coffee was good, but at $3.50/cup and with a max of two refills (shit, even L.A. doesn't do that) I can't exactly call it a highlight.I should have anticipated most of these problems, though, because you can't trust any eatery that doesn't serve real bacon."}, {"review_id": "kexnlrhSmwfv6z7P8qm-yQ", "user_id": "iNdj-vYPXmJ88LXPZqGpGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "This is one of those rare places that truly lives up to its name. You can come wanting just a small plate (they specialize in tapas), a large plate, or a refreshing take on Sunday brunch and you will leave happy. This is a great restaurant to take a group who like to share food. From the smoked gouda nachos to the Korean tacos to the crab and artichoke dip, you will want to try everything. If you find yourself there and maybe you skipped lunch that day, the plate special or Pad Thai or coconut curry will be enough to quench that empty stomach. A recent personal favorite is the steak and eggs; a nice filet [cooked to your specifications] and two local eggs (with or without cheese). The savory seasoning used on the meat demands you take tiny bites so it can last as long as possible. Also note, they do have a kids menu.    If you can stand it, push on to desserts. But no matter what, study the drink menu. Wines, exquisite cocktails, craft beers, a library of quality liquors, and some of the best sangria (red or white) [on special Friday night's]. There is outdoor seating (awning out front for coverage), but if it is windy you will want to go inside. You will be close to other people so please do not come thinking you will have plenty of personal space. If you have dinned in a bigger city, you will be right at home here.*Insider's Tip-On Sunday, all of the daily drink specials from throughout the week are offered. Be sure to remember that in Georgia, alcohol cannot be served till 12:30 pm.-As this place grows more and more popular, the need for reservations increases. You can do that through their website [it is mobile friendly]."}, {"review_id": "tJ40RUodne9LOi-Is63OVg", "user_id": "2E1F2StJe5e5JYufhhfDzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "Splendid!
