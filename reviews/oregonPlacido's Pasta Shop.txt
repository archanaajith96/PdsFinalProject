Be prepared for that to be the first question when you're greeted (even if the place is nearly empty). If you haven't made one, be prepared to wait about 2 hours to eat.  Somewhat disappointing, and I've missed out eating there twice because I'm not used to it yet. Maybe the website could make this clearer?  Maybe they could keep 1 table open that's not for rezies?"}, {"review_id": "CNyzRrvYrnaUy_aCIwAgVg", "user_id": "9GqETdp02FBDfKjwuCXj2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I went here for his birthday dinner.

This might be one of the first pasta shops to ever blow my mind. This small mom & pop shop, is a hidden gem in Eugene. I cannot believe I haven't stumbled into it before. The restaurant is quite small, so beware you might need to make reservations ahead of time! The food was delicious. My group indulged in the Caesar salad, salmon ravioli, shrimp scampi, and their dinner special! The special was a pesto cream sauce with salmon. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce! The sauce was the star!!! All dishes were superb, and I cannot wait to go back and try more of the menu. The waiting staff was friendly and attentive.

Going on a Saturday night, we had the foresight to make a reservation, and glad we called early (around 530) because they couldn't get us in until 745. This was not an issue for us as we had some other plans. When we arrived it was packed. And this place is tiny. If I'm remembering correctly, they can only seat about 32 people at a time. We arrived behind two other groups of two. There is a hostess stand just inside the door of the restaurant but not a lot of standing room. And none of these parties were acknowledged for at least 10-15 minutes of standing in the cramped corner by the door. Not even greeted by staff. Speaking of staff, there were only two people working the dining room, which really slowed down all processes. One seemed to be the primary waiter. The other served as \"hostess,\" table clearer, water filler. It seems silly to be staffed like that on a Saturday, especially when you are completely booked through closing with reservations.Once seated, the process sped up, but being ignored for so long upon entry had us both frustrated. We appreciated the attentiveness once seated. We started with a caprese salad that was delicious, the balsamic was to die for.I got the spinach ravioli wish was fresh and satisfying. My husband got spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti was really yummy, and had a good texture. The meatballs were just okay. I was impressed with the portion sizes and the prices. I don't think anything on the menu was over $18 and there was a pretty good selection. I don't think I'd go back due to our experience of being smushed in the front corner of the restaurant with four strangers for the first 10-15 minutes of our visit. The food didn't blow me away enough to overpower that rough start."}, {"review_id": "P__UzQS1FYj-aaXfYnrobQ", "user_id": "4hgznEfgV2_TWxlD3dYeqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "This is a very cozy/small space that feels cold/odd.  The food and service was spectacular though."}, {"review_id": "pT2UH_V_j-ecF4C7SKq9tQ", "user_id": "cGQvSIh5jkOb3ceH6RRwuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Called exactly 30 minutes prior to grabbing a to-go order on my 10 Hour drive back home. It was perfectly packed and ready to go upon my arrival. There's a nice little lot on the side of the restaurant so it was definitely easy to grab and go. I had a hard time deciding based on the photos that I even went to the website. Everything looked amazing! I finally decided upon the Chicken Marsala, though I still had to check on their specials over the phone just in case. Which at the moment is a seafood picante and bolognese special if you were interested. The spot is really cute and intimate. A great place to catch up with a friend or go on a date. The atmosphere was really quaint and the staff were super friendly in person and over the phone. When I unpacked my order, I was confused at why there were two boxes. I thought maybe I had accidentally grabbed someone's order and almost ran back in. But then I realized the pasta was separated to keep it from getting soggy. Which was perfect because they gave such huge proportions that I couldn't finish it. The angel hair pasta was so buttery and soft it was literally melting in my mouth. It complimented the Chicken Marsala so well. It was just so creamy and savory. I really had to hold back from ordering the lemon cheesecake because it looked absolutely delectable. But that might just have to be a trip for next time!"}, {"review_id": "lw5rwC4wniMYXVnSpOG-0w", "user_id": "BCpIyhOyz1UzE0RyKvPnfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "So, today it was well below freezing, like 18 degrees and I needed some fantastic pasta. This town has sorely lacked having great pasta. I can now say, that there is finally a place to get great food!! Placido's which is located in the old Not Your Mama's sandwich shop, has some amazing food.I ordered the chicken alfredo, which I asked if I could do some tweeks to. Without hesitation the answer was yes! That for me is a huge reason why I am given my 5 stars. Trust me when I say the food is great, but when a chef is not pretentious and willing to make a meal the way you want, I think is a huge plus.The seating for this place is limited so make sure you get there early so you can guarantee yourself a good seat and a great meal. As always with this place, parking can be a bit of a challenge as it's just not obvious that this is the right place to park, but that's a minor inconvenience for the great food you will enjoy. I look forward to my next visit!"}, {"review_id": "tO2VYbwMLSS290GQ1iZTsQ", "user_id": "uuvFUvA2P0ntm8pfKOJBew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Delicious! Small shop in the industrial-ish part of downtown. The atmosphere is nice casual, not too noisy. Only a hostess and one server needed to take care of this little gem on a Saturday night. The best-the food! Organic and hand-made everything. Bread, pasta, balsamic reduction...they even smoked their own salmon. (One of the best flavored smoked fishes I've ever had.) The worst-mildly difficult to find. I wandered around the bldg trying to find it. Entrance is difficult to see from the outside.

It is best you make reservations prior they do fill up quickly. Lucky for us we walked in there was a table available. Soon after wards the restaurant was full and guests were waiting for a table. The waiter brought us bread with dipping marinara sauce. They were so yummy we ate them all within minutes. We asked for more bread the waiter said they had none... :-| Really no bread? Was my thoughts... Waiter said we would have to wait 20 minutes more were baking. Our meal came 20 minutes later but no bread accompanied our meal. We asked about the bread but none were brought out. :-( The food was excellent! All three of us kept on saying how delicious our dishes were. We even sampled each other's food. Let me tell you my palette was craving for more... lol!!! The next day we had pizza and I mentioned this taste good. My wife mentioned not as good as the Italian dish we had last night. Touché!

But after a big hike, he agreed to come with me!It's a cute little place with a parking lot on the side. There are reserved spots for the restaurant which was nice, but I'm not sure if it ever gets completely packed. That might make parking difficult.We were seated quickly and the service was good throughout our experience. The waitresses checked to see if our food was good, let me have a shit ton of parmesan (the way I like it but am always afraid to ask), and our water glasses were never empty.The specials of the day sounded tasty but we ultimately decided to stick with their regular menu. We started off with the caprese which was nice and fresh, perfect for a post-hike, pre-dinner snack. The mozzarella chunks were large, the tomatoes were this incredible dark red color, and the basil was strong! I wouldn't have been surprised if they were just plucked from the garden. As for the entrees: I got the salmon ravioli with basil cream sauce and my boyfriend got the pesto chicken pasta. We both loved our orders, but I think we both especially loved mine ;) It was just such a unique flavor with the salmon and the basal cream. Most other pastas in the menu had your traditional marinara, pesto, or alfredo sauce. This one was special. Don't get me wrong - traditional is good! My boyfriend's pasta was clearly made with a fresh pesto (possibly spinach?) and was also delicious. These are pretty hefty portions, but we were able to finish everything because of our hike that day. I definitely saw some people with to-go containers. We also got the tiramisu and the lemon cheesecake to go, which were both creamy and not overpoweringly sweet. The cheesecake tasted like it was made with real lemon zest. Great dishes but I'm knocking off a star because the menu seemed a little limited. Wished there were some more unique flavors like the one I got. (Tough crowd, I know). Actually, I would only knock off half a star if I could. They're definitely more than a 4 star place in terms of quality.Placiado's also sells fresh pasta for if you want to cook at home, which is pretty awesome ($6 for a \"portion,\" $7 for a pound)! We got some and will be trying it out soon. Great experience overall! Would definitely come back (and highly recommend the salmon ravioli with basil cream to anyone)!"}, {"review_id": "9rgzjmYVOK5QRU5iJyIBqg", "user_id": "E_Wfxknc-y2-p09omaNZ4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Wow!  We are from out of town and love checking out local places like this.

Make sure to call for reservations or arrive right at 5pm if you hope to enjoy this pasta goodness. FOOD: Highlight of my trip to Eugene! - Foccacia, free appetizer: this is my new favorite focaccia, and I would have ordered more if the pasta weren't coming! The dough I believe had olive oil, to which I credit the tender texture, slightly floral odor, and rich taste. The coarse salt atop it added a punch of flavor here and there. The marinara it was served with was lovely too, and a great preview of the deliciousness to come.- Caprese salad: fresh mozz (slightly firmer than I would have liked) with sweet tomatoes and HUGE leaves of basil. The balsalmic reduction was nice and all the ingredients were riding on the peak of summer. All enjoyable despite being oversalted.- Spaghetti and meatballs: this was the winning pasta dish at the table--flavorful marinara that brought those tomatoes to their full potential, perfectly al dente spaghetti that is a proper ode to semolina, and meatballs (pork and beef?) that were flavorful and the right balance between tender and firm (didn't fall apart straightaway, but were relatively easy to cut with just a fork)- Veggie lasagna: large beyond imagination--this was easily two meals for me, and I have a huge appetite. The ingredients were in my ideal proportions. Enjoyed the zucchini, yellow squash, and eggplant layered between fresh noodles and a generous amount of cheese. Most importantly (for me), there was LOTS of that aforementioned marinara goodness in there, not only between the pasta layers, but also surrounding the entire slice in the serving dish. Both pasta dishes were topped with freshly ground pepper and Parmesan cheese shredded atop at the table by the most charming rotating grater I've ever seen! Dessert is available for those with room at the end--we sadly did not. SERVICE: Two friendly servers were just the right amount of attentive. Water glasses were constantly full, conversation flowed freely, and we never felt rushed despite the constant inflow of people hoping for seats.AMBIANCE: The bar was low in my mind as I walked up through the parking lot of what appeared to be an industrial building converted to office space with one room converted to Placido's Pasta Shop. That said, once inside, we were pleased by the cozy interior (not great for huge groups) with all the right small touches (wall art, fresh flower at the table, nice napkinds). Great place for date night (saw several happening here) or an intimate special celebration with friends. Outdoor seating is available too, best enjoyed after the Oregon fire season."}, {"review_id": "DoTJ1YyHNmt8w-tKF-Zc2w", "user_id": "DfHJHSAE90CkFwwTQroUXw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Came here for an anniversary dinner and thank goodness we made reservations.
