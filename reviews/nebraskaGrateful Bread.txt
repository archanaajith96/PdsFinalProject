I've tried to make it to this place a few times but have been deterred because of the time or weather restraints. Yes, the line was long and took awhile, but it was beyond worth it. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach, as I ended up ordering the two staples: a cheese scone and the chipotle Mac and cheese. I also ended up ordering the tomato veggie curry rice bowl. All of these items were just simply incredible. The servings were generous. I cannot wait to go back."}, {"review_id": "-V1HEtVHkc3vTaIxkz23cA", "user_id": "Fx9XcLlhAr0xB6clVUqu2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Great food, good atmosphere.

THE FOOD IS ALWAYS great.  It's kind-of an adventure to go there to eat, you may stand in line and lots of locals go there to get take out to take home.  Best way to figure out if they are open, when your hunger strikes is to check them out on FACEBOOK:  just search for \"Grateful Bread Lincoln NE\"These are the hours posted on their FACEBOOK now, but I wouldn't go unless I'd confirmed they really are open...

My friend had been mentioning this place to me for the longest and I finally went. I was totally mind blown by all the awesome decorations and even the potato heads on the ceiling were pretty dopetastic (word of the day!  I have never seen a unique place like this before. Food: At first I couldn't find the menu, but my friend pointed out at the colorful flyers near the cash register. They have Moroccan Tomato Soup, Chipotle Potato Soup, Soul of Zorba Mac and Cheese, Chipotle Mac and Cheese, Italian Stuffed and baked Polenta, and Indian red lentil soup to name a few. I got to try the Baby Bella Mac and Cheese, it was really gooood! It had mushrooms, Gouda cheese, bread crumbs, thyme.. you just have to try it. They also have cookies and cheese bread which I heard were must haves. This place is cash and check only, so no plastic.The Bathroom is definitely a must see. So many posters, old magazines, toys, a leopard mirror, so many cool things.if you're ever in Lincoln, make your way to Grateful Bread, it's something to be grateful for!"}, {"review_id": "Uq0Em_ePr5MecDlLQL7pnw", "user_id": "SxLNa74PYPS5eoqp34DcKw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "6/20/2017", "text": "Literally never open.

Everything there is full of flavor probably not suggested for the Bland palate you will taste spice, some heat and tons of flavor in everything they make.Whatever you do do not try the Moroccan tomato soup, especially not with a cheese scone on the side. You will become addicted.

A true Lincoln original. I went today and had split pea soup and a cheese scone. The soup was delicious, but the scone. Omg, the scone. It was like a little piece of airy heaven, perfectly designed to be eaten on its own or dipped into soup. I could have eaten five of them. Cash only. My total was just over $7, I believe. I didn't get a drink this time around, but they have a really interesting selection of specialty bottled sodas that's worth perusing."}, {"review_id": "rTORcsUuf9C5RSsvCsJNrA", "user_id": "FqTaXOsfLGZbKuyx0Wv-3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/15/2016", "text": "A Lincoln favorite. There's always a huge line and the line usually takes twice as long as it should take but it's worth it to eat the delicious food. I loved the Tibetan noodle soup but haven't had it in several years because they either don't make it anymore or I don't go on the right day. The chipotle Mac and cheese is phenomenal. My mom and I have been trying to replicate it at home for ourselves but just can't get it like they can at grateful bread.

The hours are terrible and the guy at the counter is just there to take money and hand you food. The decor is super weird and the restaurant is kind of small. But my goodness. The soup and pasta and scones are made to perfection. I seriously can't get enough of it. Great value, too, because the food is always more filling that it appears. But you'll want to keep eating more anyway because the food is. So. Good. Like them on fb to check out their menu and hours. My personal favorites are the Moroccan tomato soup and the Vampire Be Gone. Also, always order one more scone than you think you'll need."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/grateful-bread-lincoln?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
