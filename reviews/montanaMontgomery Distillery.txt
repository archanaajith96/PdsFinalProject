Delicious, inventive cocktails. I am a Manhattan girl most days, tried the Blinker last night and was so pleased I had two. Simple, homemade whiskey, homemade grenadine, and grapefruit juice. The perfect blend of sweet, savory, and bitter without the bitter. Went back today to warm up with an epic, frothy \"Dude Abide\" the Lebowski-inspired name that is now given to all White Russian variants. Hey man, there's a beverage here, that you should go drink right now. For reals. Go now, it's empty. Don't make me drink alone."}, {"review_id": "93YNNGvjSX3nM0az4fY6Jg", "user_id": "-u5kQutcNnqxtwi6PpV2FQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "Best. Manhattan. Ever. In recent times, I have become a bit of a Manhattan girl. The drink, not the city, of course. So, when I saw that they had their own rye whiskey, I casually asked if I could get a Manhattan outta that. So glad I asked. It was terrific. It was exceptional. It was... well... see the three words that start this review.My husband went for some sort of smoky vodka drink, which he fawned all over because the smoky salt rim really was to-die for. I liked his drink well enough, but really... that Manhattan.My only regret is that we were in town on a Tuesday night, so we never got to take their tour (and try some of that beautiful whiskey straight up!)."}, {"review_id": "fQ32-jF03tSFe0JH7tzphA", "user_id": "73DZUFYAXuycbJ_eEAox1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/26/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "While it may look at first glance like a sleek, sophisticated cocktail bar in the heart of downtown Missoula, MgD is, in fact, a working distillery with the guts of the operation stored in the basement, below the very ground on which you walk. You can tour these facilities on Fridays and Saturdays, by prior reservation (online or phone), or you can join a tour if you happen to be tasting at the bar and there is space available. Tours cost $5, but you'll receive a \"golden ticket\" (ala Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) that gives you $5 off a drink or bottle of spirits, no expiration ever! The tours are given by staff who work at the distillery and are deeply knowledgeable with the process. No standard, memorized lines here. No tour is likely to be the same, and a lot of what you'll learn is question-and-answer driven, so be curious. Ask dumb questions. You'll get the booze samples at the end, either way.You'll get small pours of each spirit made - vodka, gin, aquavit (an excellent Scandinavian spirit made with dill, caraway, and other botanicals), and rye whiskey. You'll also hear about their single malt program, which produces small amounts of barrel aged whiskey (made from malted barley, so scotch) that are released each fall and sell out quickly. You can finish the tour with a cocktail in the tasting room upstairs - assuming you didn't order one before the tour - and you'll likely want to return on another day to try a few more. The vodka-based drinks that use local honey, citrus, rosemary, ginger, brandied cherries, or damiana (an aromatic herb from Baja) are particularly refreshing on warmer days. If you are in a more brooding mood, some of the rye whiskey drinks (Grandpa's Ruin, New Old Fashioned, Sazerac) are good choices. And the gin-based Rocky Mountain Flip is a total classic.Sometimes, a tour can enhance a tasting experience, and making spirits is quite different than wine, mead, cider, or beer. You may not think that taking the tour at MgD is worth your while; but trust me: it really is!"}, {"review_id": "jnNCA4EnwNrkG-HCkIGzlg", "user_id": "5AhM98PFahIPW1M76-hYVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Best dirty gin martini I've ever had... and I am usually NOT a fan of gin.

They close at 8pm on Saturday so plan your evening to stop here early. It's a beautiful spot with lots of seating inside and a couple tables outside. All of the tables have something special- ours had a view of the copper column still. Lots of variety of cocktails from tiki cocktails to dirty martinis and their spin on a White Russian. Don't come hungry as they only have snacks on the menu but the kinds of snacks you want to munch on while drinking: baby bell cheeses and cheese crackers. These are thoughtful drinks with ingredients like slapped rosemary. However the attention to detail was off in a few of our drinks- missing garnishes etc. That being said, everything I sampled was balanced and I wish we had arrived earlier so I could have tried more."}, {"review_id": "etZ8VC4_loMjtD1BHzAqXg", "user_id": "HjFicP493mekZFZKF2WqnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/21/2017", "text": "Ambiance is great.

We tried the Tasting flight and got the kiddos a non-alcoholic drink which they loved too. The liquors were complex and tasty but we really loved the coffee liquor - excellent coffee flavor.

It begins with their exquisite Quick Silver vodka and continues through to their juniper berry scented White Laydie gin and their magnificent Sudden Wisdom rye whiskey. There have also been some memorable experimental batches in recent years, my favorite being a Chardonnay barrel aged gin that gave their regular gin a beautiful bronzed hue and richer mouthfeel, great for neat drinking or with a cube or two of heart-shaped ice.I don't frequent many cocktail bars, but if I did, they would look like the interior here. It's very elegant without being pretentious. It is family friendly as well as being pretty diverse.The artwork is interesting. I especially like the portraits on the back wall of nattily dressed Missoula men from an earlier era, reproduced I think from an image preserved in a local archive.The people behind the bar are very nice and skilled at their art. The mixed drinks invariably have been enjoyable on all my previous visits, but I would single out the Rocky Mountain Flip, the Sazerac, and the Phil's Collins for special praise. Whenever we are visiting Missoula, we tend to make several mandatory stops: coffee and toast at Black Coffee, early morning yoga at Bikram Yoga Missoula, hiking in the Rattlesnake, fresh baguettes and German rye bread from Le Petit Outre, raw honey, pastured meats, and organic produce from the Clark Fork farmers' market, Pacific NW wine from the Good Foods Store, craft beer at Kettlehouse, pizza at Bridge or Biga, and mixed drinks at Montgomery Distillery - with a couple of new bottles of vodka, gin, and rye for the road.

Every drink we ordered were passed around the group so I believe we tasted all of them during our multiple visits to the distillery. I loved them all. The flavors were perfectly balanced and all of the cocktails were expertly crafted. The ones that stood out were the old fashion and the sazerac. I also love the go gingerly. It was amazingly refreshing. We grabbed a couple bottles to smuggle back to OC with us on the plane. Wish we could've brought back more. Stupid weight maximums. The bottles are all beautiful--all very pre-prohibition style and fancy. It's a great touch. We were there at least three times over our weekend stay.

I will preface, I'm not a cocktail girl, but I truly appreciate a good craft cocktail. So much thought and passion goes into one drink, that passion for spirits is definitely here. You can see it in the list.However, enthusiasm and true customer service lacks. We ask questions when we go to a places like this; \"what's your favorite cocktail\" \"what was the influence behind this\" \"how did you come up with this\"... We were shot down with answers like \"I don't know\" \"we don't create the list\" \"it's from a cocktail we looked up\"....not much passion.Now this is the city girl in me coming out, but there was a huge let down when bartenders don't accommodate or even entertain the questions of first time inquiring customers or even seem like they want to be there. Let down was there but the cocktails spoke for themselves poetically.So to whoever made this list, bravo, and to whoever created these beautiful spirits, a full 'round of applause.

I ordered a Phil's Collins, which was good, and a Black Diamond, which was great. This drink isn't officially on the menu anymore, but apparently if you're in the know they will oblige. I was not in the know but had a local acquaintance to guide me. It combines a mix of vodka and honey and is seasoned with black pepper and rosemary. End result: a cocktail that's perfectly astringent and reminiscent of pine. The pepper and honey balanced each other beautifully too. The bar was comfortable. Decorations are western-style shabby-chic. The mismatched vintage glasses were cute and funny, or sometimes hideous and funny, but always a conversation starter. And I loved the size of the space. Even when all the tables were full and conversations were at high volume, the big room was able accommodate the crowd.Service was a little hands off, but we were a large party who lingered on an increasingly busy evening, so I blame that on us and not our waiter. Drinks came quickly when ordered and everyone got what they asked for, even when we swapped seats. All of them were strong and well mixed.
