I've had some great BBQ in Austin, TX and Theodore's is pretty comparable. I ordered takeout from here and it was excellent - HUGE portions (enough for another meal!) of fresh, hot food, and I can only imagine it's even better when dining in. I ordered the brisket BBQ platter, which was a generous portion of meat and included an extra side of BBQ sauce.  I chose to switch out the collard greens and slaw sides for mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. It made the meal slightly more expensive, but it was beyond worth it since the mac and cheese is so rich and creamy and the mashed potatoes have onion straws and chives on top, which is a nice touch. Unfortunately I didn't get to stay for the live music, but that's definitely on my list for next time!"}, {"review_id": "L8txTfVDNn93M3FL3t_MHQ", "user_id": "CkJSwpx1Oc_3vxFvcbUYRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "We stopped in here for dinner before a show at the MassMutual Center. Doors opened on Saturday at 5pm, and when we arrived at 5:15, it was already so packed that the three of us had to sit at the bar for our dinner, which we didn't mind since you can still order from the full menu.Best things we had: BABY BACK RIBS WET WITH CHIPOTLE BBQ SAUCE. Pulled pork. Burnt ends. Cornbread with honey butter. The brisket wasn't bad, but pretty underwhelming and dry compared to the rest of the food."}, {"review_id": "-rfafZQ_daTZ6_xYyN69Jw", "user_id": "wGn3gBJnByA4BT2aIzl2wQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I literally had a 3 course meal before coming to this place I didn't have a chance to eat a thing.

It's in a cool building and they have a fun billiards set up on the second floor! I'm a southern gal living in Springfield and this is where I get my BBQ fix. I have to recommend everything on the menu, it is all excellent. Our go to faves are, Burnt Ends, pepper jack cheese sticks, blackened chicken tenders, the wings, chicken dinner, blackened chicken sandwich and all of the desserts. The owners are friendly and very accommodating. We also love the live music. We have had family gatherings here too and they are very organized and made each event special! ."}, {"review_id": "Z-Utl2sWNm-DjGjtBRKSPA", "user_id": "dq7V1W55R3Cut-bBSHnt7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "The burnt ends are addicting, good beer selection and good music. 10/10 would recommend."}, {"review_id": "0zBMh41rrwlK6LkEPaJK9g", "user_id": "2iS1vg5TYpV_iEiNC8osTg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/24/2017", "text": "I don't think \"BBQ\" when I think of Springfield, but this place gets it right.   It feels like a Delta honky-tonk complete with the wood tables, neon lights, and piped in blues.   The food is pretty good and seems to be done right (low and slow).There's a big stage where I assume they have live music at night.   This would be a fun place to just hang out, taken in some tunes, and throw back a few on a Friday night."}, {"review_id": "yd3TCfDWUKyaxMflEGQTYw", "user_id": "41PbLpfxzsiCvus79pEsPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Thank you Keith!

Never had any drinks but tried pretty much all of their food. Atmosphere (3/5): It's just an old bar. Nothing special but they do have live music during the weekend and people dance to it quite often. Could use some improvement but I definitely don't come here for atmosphere. Service (4/5): It is not a fine dining experience but all the servers here are nice. They are attentive and you can actually talk to them instead or just ordering food and drinks. Food (4.5/5):  Definitely best beef short rip in Western Mass. People seem to love crawfish poppers and burnt ends. I didn't love the poppers and burnt ends are hit or miss. Some days they are divine but some days they are overcooked to the point where it feels so dry. Most of their food are really good though but if it's your fist visit, try beef short rips. You get two huge bones with three preset sides. Their honey butter corn bread is a must try. Price (4.5/5): This is probably more on expensive side of bar in the area but their food is definitely worth the money for most of the bbq."}, {"review_id": "LCD8rCmJscfCSbN5Gt9XhQ", "user_id": "MAAYwKbAHZ96WrqCRW5g1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Friendly staff for a busy Friday night.

Not from repressed anger or life events ... but simply because I did not know of this place sooner. The ultra vintage signage (cool ones - not super quirky- mostly tobacco, blues and cigarette ads.and not just ones from the 80s .. but like WWI)Crazy strange space that feels cozy and intimate for a venue or dinner but it's open, not claustrophobic and yet filled with books to hide in away from the immediate crowd and band during a show. Now I have only been once but I am going to venture to say there isn't a bad item on the menu. We had a sampling of the nachos , rib sampler dinner (St. Louis, baby back and one enormous beef short rib), Alfredo blacked chicken pasta,  beans , slaw, Mac n cheese and cornbread. Each and every single item we ordered was PERFECTLY executed. I mean absolutely the best representation of what each meal was .. by definition .... by looks, smell, smoke, sweetness and lingering tastes that screamed for your palette's attention.  My goodness lord I think by leaps and bounds I have found the best bbq in New England. For TRUTH.  No lie the food can't be missed and will NOT disappoint. Our waitress had to have been the sweetest woman in the world. She was right on top of the refills, napkins, sauces , and she bagged and boxed up everything for us as we paid the bill.The one downfall a person could place on here would be the parking situation on a busy event night. There are several lots to pay and get in but the lot located directly next to the building is an all night only lot so not for a grab some beer and grub.. but rather stay till last call for $10. Street parking seems to be reserved heavily for the valet situation for other restaurants on the street. Also - NOT the location to have a quiet intimate dinner for Valentine's Day - I had to basically scream at my boyfriend to talk over the bodacious blues belting out across the room.. but we expected all that. Exemplary service. Cool vibes that are steeped into these walls- that I'm Sure if they could talk would be the most interesting to listen to. Food was phenomenal, outstanding and high in quality. Cannot wait to return!"}, {"review_id": "LJCUD8JIib3fJhL0uHL39A", "user_id": "OlJcCQuAUZe1HcVpiKatUQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "The baby back ribs were awesome, service wasn't the best; but I don't expect anything more from Springfield"}, {"review_id": "iHr3HVdVpQqFK78gITRKvA", "user_id": "d7nxpwyj4NWD_O6x5MPFNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "Great spot!!! I would go at least once a week if lived closer. I am 1 hour away. I will revisit when ever I am in the area. I went to watch a sporting event. They have a lot of televisions.

One of the few gems that has lasted through time. I've come here so many times and it's always been good. Great spot to meet friends. There's usually live music and people are having a good time. Love the food here, esp the ribs although everything tastes good. Very good beer selection and they also have a full bar. Overall great spot to check out in Springfield. There's a paid parking lot nearby and also street parking. There's also a place upstairs that's much quieter with pool tables and fuss ball tables although the kitchen's the same."}, {"review_id": "zaY-jWXRWWfFh4fmX0Rc7g", "user_id": "PW7FZ5m0lOUW8gCIZzhZ1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/4/2017", "text": "Honestly, I was pretty surprised with how good the food was! Big portions, decent prices and great bbq sauce. Parking is a bit of a hassle if you can't find street parking, but we didn't really have any issues finding parking. When you get seated, they bring you some popcorn which is a nice touch. The popcorn has obviously been popped for a while so it's not super fresh, but hey, how can you complain about free popcorn??We ended up getting the burnt ends - and man, the basket they gave us had to have like 10-12 pieces in it. My boyfriend and I were practically full after finishing this basket and we didn't even get to our main entree yet! We also ended up getting a half rack of baby back ribs (perfectly fall off the bone delish) + 1 lb of brisket + we changed out a side for an extra $1. Everything was really good and I enjoyed mixing the BBQ sauces together (I like to mix the bourbon + caroline mustard). After our meal, we walked close by to another establishment that offers you free pool play + other games with your Theodore's receipt! Overall, Theordore's isn't the best BBQ of your life, but it's pretty damn good for being in a random location like Springfield."}, {"review_id": "SMoJgp8sFxkBzPey048XsQ", "user_id": "5YNprXgwDZZWBBgWiYatlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Great place for music and food.
