I got the Mac n cheese, and it was my favorite part. Lunch was $11 with a drink. The place was very clean, and the employees attentive. Someone came to take our trays & cleaned up the table. I really liked having all the bbq sauces on the table, and the bottles weren't sticky. My friends said the ribs were really good."}, {"review_id": "1xu5X9skaeZhU2g8kaMCrQ", "user_id": "IxbNxLGP9ctld2RGvw0rXw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Decent barbecue, nothing too super amazing, but solidly okay. I had a sliced brisket sandwich with potato salad and it came with a slice of sausage...prices are good, service is excellent. Everyone was genuinely nice and helpful to someone who had never visited before. Place is super kitschy and cute"}, {"review_id": "aOBx-zm_RdSgKBkfnAhFGg", "user_id": "lY4qqElgztwmTINAoDZt5A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "I ate here this past weekend. Yes, I liked the food. It was good going down, but coming back out was a different story. My husband and I both got sick. My husband however was the worst. He had projectile diarrhea on Saturday and Sunday and we had eaten there on a Friday night. Him and I both had different plates, but he ate some of my sliced brisket. I do believe that was he cause of us both getting sick. My two daughters were with us and they never got sick but of course they were not eating he sliced brisket. If you do plan on going here, just get something different than the sliced brisket."}, {"review_id": "76ULGlNcqDXgx6N1EYzcRw", "user_id": "ts5o422B9oxWpwnXpYipzA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/24/2017", "text": "Had Ralph's the other day. It was ok-ish...The mac n' cheese was the star of the show. It was really good and really creamy.However the BBQ left me disappointed. I love BBQ of all shapes and sizes, but what I don't like is when BBQ is way overcooked and then stored in a vat of its juices to make it \"taste\" moist. That was pretty much all of the meats minus ribs that I saw on the line. None of it was fresh cut/pulled.My wife and I both got sandwiches. She got chicken, I got pork. I noticed that he grabbed my pork out of basically soup to put on the sandwich so I immediately turned over my bun so that the bottom bun wouldn't fall apart from sogginess. My wife did not though and her chicken also came out of soup. Her sandwich bun had already fallen apart by the time she sat down and there was a pool of juices all around it. So she ate the meat and her sides.Pork and Chicken were both overcooked and dry despite being stored in soups of their juices. Also the pork was shredded super fine so that it was almost like eating sloppy joes or porky paste instead of a pulled pork sandwich. The pork sausage they had on the side was pretty decent though. I could do a plate of just that probably without much complaint.I guess I should try the ribs if I go again and I probably will go again because Fort Smith is pretty desperate for decent BBQ. Whole Hog is pretty good, but Ralphs was really meh.Again though, they make great Mac N' Cheese."}, {"review_id": "ukYhaBTDuIMgmjJvXoUEsQ", "user_id": "s3hYQs_xq0WaFpSnuBDy6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Ralphs Pink Flamingo BBQ has an Extremely friendly staff with good bbq and great deserts"}, {"review_id": "Hx5uVv0CbTnN5TXrMqmQSw", "user_id": "Oidtv4nPH9Ai_oKDQPMBVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/26/2016", "text": "I do not live in Fort Smith but my GF does. So, when we crave for something meaty, this is our default place. Goodness, I tried talking to her of trying out different places and we still end up here.So, what to get here... I suggest the salad.Just kidding. If you order a salad here, you kinda missed the point of this place. I have tried all of their offerings, and they are good. I tried all their sauces, and they are good. I have tried all the permutation of meat and sauces, and they are good.The serving is big. So, my tip is to order the judge if there is two of you.All the folks there are nice. This is a counter service so they do not really \"serve\" you in a traditional sense.One complain... their water dispenser is as slow as molasses.

This is real deal BBQ. I got a two meat combo. The brisket was some of the best I ever had- very tender with good bark. Beans were excellent.

They have a variety of sauses/ BBQ's on the tables for you to try with your meat. I would skip the corn: it has been soaking in a water bath for a while and for it s a bit on the soggy side. Atmosphere: Cafeteria with flare, lots of flamingo pictures, and cutouts. You get a tray and go through getting your food similar to subway. There is also a condiments bar with pickles, cheese, hot peppers, etc to add if you'd like afterwards. The place isn't new and could use a good scrub and remodel, but I would definitely go there to eat again. The good is solid southern BBQ and the people are friendly."}, {"review_id": "cyJq4lM8OHH7A9lOw5cpFw", "user_id": "6oBxfwqHbxkm9f8Yq0a27Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/3/2017", "text": "Always an excellent experience.
