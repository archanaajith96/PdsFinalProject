It shouldn't even be a question, if this is the best burger in town. The menu is burger focused, but creative. The French fries are fresh cut and are a must. The Market Square location is perfect. Be prepared to wait, because the seating is scarce and the restaurant is very popular.

We were told by locals that they had great burgers. I was not inspired. However, we went because it was not too far. I am so glad we did.First, finding this restaurant took us to a really fun place, a bit of a plaza. Lots of stores and restaurants on a very wide, closed street. It was very nice and pleasant at night.The food itself was much better than a burger joint. This is so much better than fast-food, even if it is really quick. We had a really tasty \"spicy crab dip\" appetizer and a basic hamburger, topped of with a piece of chocolate-peanut butter cheesecake. It was all absolutely marvelous. Nicely blended and accented flavors.Finally, the service rocked. I hope your waitress is as good as Taylor was for us. She made dinner a fun experience. A beautiful personality who cared upon making us feel special.I heartily recommend this wonderfully excellent \"burger-joint\"!"}, {"review_id": "BhculaXa4ohsCZpAUrZmOQ", "user_id": "TrU49Ydk2ZMjlh0rtOVj7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "When arriving in town after a long day of travel I wanted a burger. I yelped burgers and Stock & Barrel appeared to be a fine option in downtown Knoxville. As luck would have it a colleague did the same and I saw her as well. So a spoiler alert, this is worthy of the 4.5 overall rating. Super cool place in a historic building. Seating outside, but it was too cool. I pulled the wooden double doors open and the place presented as I hoped. Wood floors, high ceilings and a bar along the wall. A good lunch crowd was going down. My friend and I elected to sit at the bar. Table and chair seating is on the floor. A female bartender greeted us and brought menus and got waters going ahead of a possible beer order. It did not take me long to decide on a Hardywood Backwoods Bastard after a sample. I honed in on the Steakhouse burger and asked for it medium rare with side of onion rings. Food was in around 15 minutes, or so. The burger must have been a half pound. I nibbled on the onion rings first and loved how they were fried. The onions broke apart without being yucky stringy. The burger was cooked correctly and delightfully delicious. Our server/bartender checked in on us and was fantastic at multi tasking a busy bar. My friends enjoyed their meal as well. We were all happy with the choice. I would definitely return and recommend."}, {"review_id": "5_6mQfiOQITvAi7iodoM-A", "user_id": "_xPYmAYYllLnZ3GyJRiL1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Good burgers and service. They have a lot of choices for burgers and for drinks, everyone had an easy time finding something they liked. I tried the billy and it was delicious. The beef itself had a lot of good flavor and texture. The bun held up to the patty and toppings. The amount of toppings were not excessive which I appreciate. A lot of times novelty burgers are impossible to bite into but these were the perfect size and you don't feel like they are skimping. Fries and onion rings were good and you get a good amount.

Lived up to the hype.Duck fries were nice, worth tasting but not critical to the experience!Price... not too much in my opinion. You know what you're getting into. There isn't a dollar menu at S&B.

Stock & Barrel is a down to earth pub, with limited seating (especially on game day). While we did make a reservation, we preferred a table by the TVs at the bar, so we ended up grabbing seats at the bar for 4 people when they miraculously opened up. While it was definitely a little difficult to speak from one end of the bar to the other, we were still able to order a few things and share them amongst each other while enjoying the game. Service was friendly - the bartenders were pretty attentive. We ordered mushrooms (Crispy 'Shrooms) and fried feta cheese (Opa!). Both were pretty tasty. The fried mushrooms took some getting used to - the horseradish flavor is pretty heavy. I wasn't a huge fan at first but found myself unable to stop scarfing them down at the end. The fried feta was DELISH. I would have picked up the whole block of honey drizzled cheese and eaten it whole if I could.I ordered a local Knoxville brew to sip on while munching on the fried apps. I'm usually not a red ale type of girl but this was delicious. Blackhorse, you're the dark horse in the running for greatness!Overall, Stock & Barrel is a great place to watch any game if you can get the seats for it. However, when there busy, don't count on it. There are plenty of good apps and burgers to choose from, and don't forget to try some of their beers on tap!"}, {"review_id": "WCQDIY8M90V3B1DZbCoooQ", "user_id": "ZDo8vZYC_-u1Zi2zrsAyLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "My co worker and I stopped by mid afternoon after landing in Knoxville around 2 pm, based off of location to our hotel and good reviews. We were both starving and wanted a good meal.In the end, we probably ate and ordered too much food. The entire menu looked delicious. I had decided to eat a bison burger, so I made sure to do that, but customized it a bit with bacon, garlic aioli. I ordered it medium rare and it came out just as I ordered. I did specifically ask for mac and cheese instead of fries as my side, and the order was brought out with fries instead of mac and cheese. Also, I specifically asked for the burger without the tomato jam, but the burger included tomato jam anyway, which I didn't make a fuss about and just ate it as-is.The food and presentation was on par. The inside space is small but the setup was perfect. It accentuated that we were in a great college town. I also ordered the spicy crab dip. My co worker decided not to have any, so for just one person it's way too much and far too heavy. I wish I hadn't eaten so much of it by myself. It was good but not amazing. Very thick and heavy with cream.Overall we were both very impressed and made a right choice. Had my order been correct the first time, I would have considered a 5 star rating."}, {"review_id": "4O_N-C3ySPgL6FkzZUEPsg", "user_id": "QdDnmWKb-elFcxqtSYPnFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "Awesome burgers! We made two visits on a recent trip to Knoxville. Our friends did us a huge favor when they recommended Stock & Barrel. The food was so good, we HAD to come back the next day. The burger choices are extensive. Beef was fresh and cooked exactly as requested. Side orders, including onion rings, french fries and black beans were also enjoyable. The beer list was limited and a couple of the selections were sold out. This was a minor disappointment but also related to the high customer volume. Pro tip: We used the Yelp skip the wait feature to be seated when we arrived and you should to. The environment is cozy, without feeling too crowded. There weren't any empty seats however we never felt crowded. Service was quick and complete. Servers on both visits answered questions about beers and specials professionally and quickly.

We shared the bison burger with fries fried in duck fat plus an order of onion rings. The bison burger was ordered medium rare, since it is naturally lean, but it was served on the well side of medium with pink barely detectable. It was just okay, and would have sent it back if we didn't have somewhere to go. We couldn't finish the fries, mainly because it was overly greasy and heavy, and we were sharing! I know homemade fries tend to be greasier than commercial frozen fries, but I wouldn't order it again. The onion rings were extra crispy and the atmosphere and service was good."}, {"review_id": "ZtsxrQDxdvKTzl8cEf5eUQ", "user_id": "-9OEoNjcLa9nBiu41nHiaQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Stopped in and tried the Farmhouse Burger.

There's parking in the market square parking garage, which definitely helps get you closer to the restaurant when you're in need of a fix that only Stock and Barrel can stratch. True to its name, this place does two things and only two things. Burgers & Bourbon. And they do both incredibly well. Their list of burgers and bourbon is phenomenal.

My favorite part was the local honey that's fried into the mushrooms -Fried feta: drizzled in that luscious honey also had a light crisp around it.- Bison Burger: get it done medium. Took one bite then sat and relished in its glory. The Boursin cheese was creamy and coated the juicy burger perfectly. The onions gave it the extra crunch need.-  Duck fat fries: oh yes not for those with high blood pressure. Potatoey and crispy nice and salty-Nutella milkshake: sides of the cup are drizzled with Nutella and the perfect end to my mealThe reason I gave it 1 star down was bc of the service.
