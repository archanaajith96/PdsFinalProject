The drink selection is among the best you'll find downtown.

We ended up getting a liquid bread breakfast of an apricot ale and pale ale. Currently, there is 4th st and surrounding road construction. Don't let that deter you.

One thing I love is The Depot's red brick building. Inside has hardwood flooring and it feels so open. We decided to eat in the dining area and the wall facing us had what seemed like floor plans and measurements which added character! We started off by ordering drinks and our server was very helpful by giving us some beer samplers. We ended up getting a James & The Giant and a Return of the Milk Man Nitro. I don't know a whole lot about beer, but I do know that I love milk stouts. Both were very refreshing.  As for the food, we started off with the cornbread fritters. With that honey glaze, every bite takes you to cloud nine. We then ordered fish & chips and the Depot burger. The fish & chips were crispy with a light batter and the fish was moist. The depot burger had a nice beef patty with a ton of pastrami. Talk about a meaty and juicy burger. Each entree came with a side of French fries and accompanying it was  house made ketchup. We asked our server about the ketchup because it was fresh and tasty. Definitely not your Heinz ketchup, I'll tell you that. There's a couple of items on the menu I would still like to try. Not to mention their merchandise, specifically their hats, looks nice. Which means we will have to come back sometime very soon."}, {"review_id": "zgOSzQbwlCV6y0QKs1CE5g", "user_id": "BiLX0Yc3vNJjVNLocBJyHA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "We came here about 5 p.m. on a Saturday to meet some friends.

It is listed on the US National Register of Historic Places and is Nevada Historical marker number 210.Overall it was a good experience, however, we do have a couple of suggestions:Have all the menu options available to customers; they were out of the following items that we wanted to order: Mango Voyager IPA, poutine, and the shrimp tacos.  The stools in the bar area are extremely uncomfortable and should be replaced.

Just after we sat down we had complimentary cornbread fritters on the table, and the beer came quickly and was plentiful. (You should try the Highlander. Yum.) For food I just went with the classic burger, and it was delicious. My companions had the Depot burger and the chicken sandwich, both of which were reported to be delightful. I will note that both of the burgers were ordered \"medium\" and they definitely seemed more \"rare\" than anything else, but we were both okay with that, so we let it slide.Oh! And both the regular fries and the sweet potato fries were really good. Although I wish they had more sauce options for the sweet potato fries; they make their own BBQ specifically for them and it was good, but that's not really my bag."}, {"review_id": "WRx_Ut9Gz1AwHylK8Zf7Rw", "user_id": "I-B94Itmdq9IRKdf4gCQyw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "I tried the Depot in its early days and was less than impressed with their service in the Bar or Restaurant.

The menu is not huge but has a good variety, enough that most people should find something on there that meets their need.We ended up with the Poutine, Wings, and Caprese/Bruschetta. The Wings were some of the first that i had that actually had a bit of spice to them, so thumbs up there, they could however have been a little hotter. The Poutine was very tasty and the meet VERY tender, it could have done with a little more curds, and again could have been hotter. The Caprese/Bruschetta was as expected.We also had an excellent brewery tour from one of the owners.

The server brought our table a complimentary order of their cornbread fritters, served warm with a sticky sweet bourbon honey.  They were the highlight of the meal!For dinner, I ordered the roasted pork dip.  It had thinly sliced pork loin, red cabbage, jalapeno and a sriracha aioli sauce...which was an odd combo but worked alright.  The plate also came with a sweet syrup, which I'd assumed was to be drizzled over the sandwich, which I did.  The dish was served with a side (chopped iceberg) lettuce salad.  Wished they had included mixed greens instead of bland iceberg.All in all the meal was decent, but I'm not sure I'll be rushing back anytime soon."}, {"review_id": "ABZSK_SHINuvZ6ifLo-muw", "user_id": "iBEsxORk3f99xY-0tTG6qw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Went here on a Monday with couple of friends for some drinks and small meals all the while also looking for a new Monday spot.

Shrimp tacos, MEH!!! The texture was good, however, a whole shrimp is placed in middle of a taco shell. It'll be so much better if they were at least chopped up so it spreads in the shell more. The coleslaw was bland, not much flavor to it. Overall, the shrimp tacos just didn't cut it for us. I will not be ordering it in the future. Our server was good, but there were couple of times when he was nowhere to be found when we needed something.

Glad we made a reservation because there was a few group waiting for tables. We got seated right away and was served complimentary cornbread fritters, so yummy and different. There were a total of 4 of us and we shared the 4 for $8 beer samples because that way we could try each other's beer. I'm not a beer person so I didn't really enjoy them but they're good to try out if you do like beer. Our waitress did inform us that they brew their own beer and spirits in the house which was interesting. Let's get to the food part, we ordered the fish and chips, shrimp tacos with spicy coleslaw, roasted pork dip, and the chicken sandwich. Most of their gastro-fare items came with a choice of regular french fries or sweet potatoes fries. The food was great. Great balance of flavors and proportions. Our waitress, which we forgot her name, so sorry, but she was great. She answered all our questions about the beers and the food on the menu since we told her it was our first time. She checked on us occasionally even when the place was filled with people. Overall, this experience has been amazing. The Depot is a chill hangout place. Great for groups and good drinks and food.

Our server Samantha was top notch, very sweet, professional and attentive.  We started with the Corn Bread Fritters. Just imagine the most delicious corn bread lightly fried with fresh whipped creams to cut through the savory. They are great to start with or to compliment any meal. Each order has about 8 to share. The birthday girl we were with deserve and A+ for ordering because she ordered a french toast for the table, which was PERFECT! Four slices of french toast smothered in maple syrup and blueberries (couldn't really tell the bourbon was in the \"jam\". Huge hit! I never had chicken and waffles, so I got the Chicken and Waffle Sandwich. It was fabulous! So glad i got it! It was a little dry, so a sauce of some kind maybe made with maple syrup and some type of fruit would be a great compliment to the sandwich. Or make the breading on the chicken a little less.  The onions were nice, but maybe there just needs to be a little more added to the sandwich. My friend got the Lobster Roll of which I had a bite of and thought the flavor was great! I loved the non traditional capers added to it. However, I am from the east coast and their lobsters rolls don't have any less than 4 oz of lobster. Maybe keep it in chunks and don't shred it so the flavor of capers does not over power the sweeter taste of the lobster. The Belly Hash and Eggs was so good my husband said and although the eggs were over cooked when he ordered over easy he still thought it was good, he was just looking forward to the eggs being runny. For sides, we shared the brussel sprouts and poutine they are big sides and easy to share between four people. We all had cocktails with our brunch and they were all great! My only tip to the restaurant would be to rename the Manmosa. We thought of the name BBM (Big Beautiful Mamosa). So much better and a little sexual so everyone will be happy with their choice! Everything from the service to ambiance, drinks to entrees were fantastic. My entire party was impressed by brunch at The Depot and look forward to coming here again!"}, {"review_id": "TsHMSatTB-NynhcqeUHl1g", "user_id": "9Nc8pZH38fAtfEdkjsRQAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Good food, parking hard to find.

From the wood floors to the tiles and even the lighting. I'd say 5 stars for the design!As for the food, we got a complimentary cornbread flitters. This was super yummy. It's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The bourbon honey glaze/sauce was just sweet enough to compliments the salty bite of the flitters. There was a hint of the jalapeño as well. Personally, I like cornbread with jalapeño so it hit the spot. The main course, I got the roasted pork dip with a side of fries. It was salty, a bit spicy from slices of the jalapeño, and tasty. The dipping sauce brought on the sweetness and tang. It was a great flavor harmony. However, I think the fries were too soggy and salty for my liking. I'm a big fries fan and I was not a big fan of this one. Maybe I got a bad batch? Though, the ketchup and ranch were on point.

However, it's quite expensive for what you get and the cocktails that I've had there have been weak. The stools are not the most comfortable, either. Poutine, fish n chips, Caesar salad, two drinks, and the peaches n cream dessert came out to $85 for two, including tip. Previously, I've had the Brussels sprouts and mac and cheese bites. The dishes are hit or miss. I wouldn't get the poutine again. The fries were very good but they didn't use cheese curds. The fish was a bit greasy. We did like the Caesar salad, which came with three strips of anchovy on top. The best dish of the night was the dessert, which wasn't too sweet and was topped with yummy and crunchy pecans.
