I went to North Carolina for my birthday and a friend and I had Easter brunch here just before getting on the plane. This place was CRAZY busy, but somehow, you couldn't tell the way the staff here carried themselves and treated us. I highly recommend making a reservation and arriving hungry. The food was amazing and you can't go wrong with any of the crowd favorites mentioned in 99% of these reviews. I love open kitchens (those always make me feel better) and the music was indie coffehouse chill which I love for a nice meal. My friend and I could speak without yelling at each other and there were large groups all over the place that seemed to have an easy time speaking as well. I think I got a chance to speak with an owner or manager to help me with my check-in. She was super nice but our waitress stole the show. She was so nice, so patient and I could always see her checking on us and her other tickets constantly to make sure we were OK despite an insanely busy room. If anyone from management sees this, please feel free to message me so we can figure out her name and make sure she wins your employee competition. She deserves it!"}, {"review_id": "WV58531089CxTzNADXOiFA", "user_id": "VVxDe3-2NdjFPRj1z8Fpgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Southern charm. Creative food choices.

I would definitely suggest a reservation for any sized party. I came for a bachelorette brunch. Their mimosas are HUGE. We started with the fried green tomatoes with goat cheese grits. The tomatoes were not greasy at all. The breading was light and flavorful. I didn't particularly like the grits (the texture in general off puts me not this specific establishment's dish) but the other girls devoured it! I got the fried chicken sandwich with a side salad (no dressing). This was fantastic. The chicken (like the green tomatoes) were perfectly breaded and fried. The salad was crisp and I loved the radish on top. This dish (like the rest) were huge. I finished the rest for lunch!"}, {"review_id": "dNOLg2QeczhUpsdVKAtBaw", "user_id": "92UYzB-HR4Ei8mOmDzLPhA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Very disappointing. Our server, Kendra, our was friendly but that did not make up for the bland tasting burger that I ordered. I had the pimento burger with fried pickles and it tasted like a paper sandwich. I did not taste the meat. It was as though the burger was washed in water then grilled. The restaurant was extremely packed so if you plan on going, you should call ahead and make reservations. The food prices were overpriced and my burger was not worth $14. I had better burgers at Burger King. I don't think that I will be going back.I went back on 4/7/2018 to giveTupelo another chance. We had chipotle wings, sweet potato pancakes with eggs and fried chicken, shrimp and grits and fried chicken with gravy, Mac and cheese and collard greens. Totally different experience. Alec was our server and he was great: friendly, attentive and personable. The food was satisfying and came out fast. We went during non peak hours so there was no wait time to be seated. Great time. The food was excellent and the management, Yohan and April made us feel appreciated."}, {"review_id": "XoCJaPs67pH_BhZdpXOpIw", "user_id": "LVwhg149FN8tDAVWTFe-Eg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Had green fried tomatoes, that was served over goat cheese grits and roasted red peppers coulis.

All meals come with buttermilk biscuits. It's served with honey and jam.  The biscuits were warm ; soft on the inside and firm on the outside.  They were fabulous.  My meal was the slow roasted blackberry habanero pull pork stacked atop of a pasture raised beef patty.

This is quite a busy place during a random weekday lunch! I like that there was plenty of parking options behind the restaurant, since it was also close to a metro station. The restaurant is on the second floor, so you will have to take either flight of the stairs to go up. As soon as you walk up the stairs, you will see a very inviting environment, with string lights and cute outdoor seating for those who want to enjoy a nice day outside. My party was seated inside by the window, and I immediately nerded-out looking at their ceiling fans. Their ceiling fans are connected together by a pulley system, and powered by a motor! Pretty darn cool. Not knowing what to order, our server first brought us some corn bread to share with some berry-type jam and honey. Mixing the berry jam and the honey together was the best! We then ordered a Grilled cheese pork sandwich and a pork shoulder dish. I was actually quite disappointed by the pork shoulder dish. I wish that the meat was a bit more juicy, but most of it was rather dry besides the part that has some fat on top of it. It didn't have much flavoring besides the toppings on top of the pork shoulder and I wish they had a dry rub or marinated it a bit before cooking it. The Brussels sprouts sides and the fries were amazing though! And the Grilled Cheese Pork Sandwich totally made up for it! It was sweet and salty all mixed together. Although it was slightly on the oily side, it tasted amazing and I didn't mind. Overall, I had a great dining experience here. The ambiance here reminds me of a cute southern town, and I just wish I ordered something else on the menu that they were probably more well known for. Until next time!"}, {"review_id": "_wqgu8CmIzyZNFaIrw-oZg", "user_id": "oUilYNfXensjapTI_s7cOQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I've been to Tupelo Honey in Asheville and Raleigh and always had great experiences. Today I had brunch at the Charlotte location and was less than impressed. We had a party of 6 and our reservation was at 12:30. We waited quite a while past 12:30 to be seated, but we didn't mind that so much because they comped us two appetizers for the inconvenience. The appetizers were great. We got the fried green tomatoes and avocado toast points. My entree wasn't great. I had the Old Skool breakfast bowl, sub scrambled eggs for over easy. My friend ordered the same bowl and had different modifications. When our meals arrived (after a lengthy wait) my scrambled egg bowl had her modifications, and her bowl had over easy eggs but no modifications. This was pointed out to our server. It wasn't a huge deal but since we didn't get what we ordered, a discount might have been appropriate. The bowl itself was sort of flavorless and the grits were dry. The service was not what I would expect. Our waitress didn't know anything about the drink I ordered (lavender limeade which was delicious by the way). It took a long time to get our food (not the server's fault) and an absurdly long time to get our checks. I don't think I would return to this location, but would happily return to Asheville or Raleigh!"}, {"review_id": "RqOKDdUEh9Oq4scsB7Jeqg", "user_id": "bSXpj3DcGFjRTIlFVQIroA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "First time to charlotte and went as a recommendation.

I was looking forward to trying the new menu.  We came on a Saturday night, it was packed! We arrived at about 7:30 and was told the wait was 45 minutes, which it was.  The waitress that took our order was very nice.  She brought out drinks and we ordered our food right away. So an hour passes and at first I thought because it was busy, but we only ordered two tacos, a side of fries and the scallop entree.  I asked if they knew how much longer it would be because no one came to our table or said anything.  Come to find out, our ticket was lost.  I understand things get busy, but the waitress should've been aware that we still didn't have food and done something sooner. My scallops were cold in the middle and I decided I didn't want to order anything else because we had other plans to get to. We ended up leaving a little after 10PM. The taco I had was really good. It was the pork.  They come on corn tortillas, which aren't my favorite, but I was surprised to enjoy it a lot anyway.

Perhaps, that's why it's taken me so long to come back. However, I came for an event after work and had the opportunity to try some more goodies. We started with apps and I tried the tried mason jar dips, okra and honey chipotle wings.  Meh. They were fine, nothing really exciting. However, I fell in love with the crispy brussels appetizer. The combination of lemon, garlic and bacon and herbs. Then add the side of ranch. Yummy. I could have eaten those all night long. For my meal I ordered the Shoo Mercy sweet potato pancakes. It was a lot of food! Three pancakes, bacon, eggs, fried chicken and grilled fruit. The pancakes were just okay. The chicken was pretty typical and the eggs and bacon were both standard.

Finally the chance came when my friend wanted brunch and I couldn't figure out a good place to go that was open before 11:30. The restaurant is definitely cute in terms of decor and feeling welcoming, but the positives of the vibes probably end there. To be fair, we sat inside - not that the hostess even bothered to ask about a preference, but sitting outside could have a nicer ambiance than what I experienced today. The hostess politely tried to sit us at a very small table at the back of the restaurant. Upon seeing the size of the table, I felt like the plates would be too crowded with drinks and such and requests a larger table as there were 10-15 empty tables. The hostess cops an attitude and walks about to the front to 'check to see if she could do it'. I sheepishly follow her like a lost puppy dog that just got berated for chewing up a shoe. She then takes my friend and I back to the back of the restaurant by the kitchen/washroom door and seats us. Really? All the empty tables and you put us in the back by the kitchen? Honestly the table she sat us at probably shouldn't even be there as the whole time my dining partner was constantly hit/bumped by servers trying to pass through with food/dishes. At one point a waiter actually asked him to move so he could get by. I'm sorry if there isn't room for a customer to sit at this table without being told to move by waitstaff while sitting normally...then that is a good clue the table shouldn't be in that location. Honestly a very awkward and awful experience and that isn't even including the innumerable amount of times I heard distressing loud noises bellowing from the dishwashing area...not what I expect in terms of ambiance when I am paying ~ $20/entree. Despite the seating issue and the attitude of the hostess the food was amazing! Biscuits were very well balanced with the salt and pepper standing up to the blueberry jam. Ordered the Omelets with pimento cheese, green tomatoes, bacon, and ham. Seriously one of the best omelets I have ever had. Worth a visit for the high quality ingredients and great tasting food, just be firm about being seated in an area where you won't be treated as a nuisance by staff."}, {"review_id": "q24QFGvdBhusEANEkhlyHg", "user_id": "sbbB6Y4yIZIInvt0LFYYew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "It is a restaurant with nice patio seatings on a 2nd floor.
