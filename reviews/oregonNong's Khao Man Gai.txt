Living and working in the neighborhood, I decided it was finally time to try their famed Khao Man Gai.I opted for the pork and rice, and as a lover of fatty pieces of meat, was completely blown away. The texture of the gorgeously cooked pork, mixed with the rice, and that legendary sauce had me craving more.The chicken and rice is a simple dish. I think next time I'll have to try just dark meat, because it was a tad bit dry for my liking. Today I tried their Super Soup today, and have zero qualms. It's a substantial serving, expertly seasoned, and warms you up like no other. Perfect for a rainy spring day when you need a comforting pick me up.I'm always greeted with a friendly smile, and I feel good supporting a local business that takes care of their employees. Thank you Nong's!"}, {"review_id": "2Elhs-Kb9BPPkMbiF9SGSw", "user_id": "cwZ64E_XT92XesWkQh85YQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Nong's Khao Man Gai Hainanese Chicken Dish is delicious.

I got the regular size khao man gai for $11. Prices have gone up 15% since my last visit but I don't think the ingredients justify it. At. It's most basic, this place is serving some chicken on a plate of rice with sauce. The chicken is tender but not as tender as my first visit and the rice is just a bit too hard. The soup itself is too salty so keep some water handy. I don't think I'll be back a 3rd time.

We met up with my boyfriend's cousin and he said it's a \"tourist trap\". I had to find out for myself. We all ordered the #1 and because they were celebrating an anniversary, we each got a free Thai tea as well! The tea was delicious and a great addition to the meal. We wanted to add chicken skin to our orders, but they were already out at 1pm. :( The dish came with plenty of chicken, rice, cucumbers, and my favorite - the bowl of winter melon soup! The sauce here was a little sweet and spicy; not something I've had before and it was so delicious I had to pour it on my rice at the end! Chicken was nice and tender - I ordered the dark meat, but my boyfriend got white meat and mentioned it was a little dry. Overall, a solid Asian place in Portland.

Thai tea was less sweet than usual, which I really appreciated. The peanut chicken was really underwhelming. It's literally chicken breast with an alright peanut sauce on top. The regular chicken rice was also okay, but a lot better than the peanut chicken. Their best dish is definitely the pork and rice. I think I probably like it a lot just because it reminds me of a pork dish I eat a lot back in SoCal. Sauce is on point, and the braised pork is super flavorful.One thing I really like about this restaurant is the decor and atmosphere. It has the intimate, hustling and bustling feel of a Southeast Asian restaurant. I'd come here often if I were a Portland resident, but hopefully another place with cheaper prices opens up."}, {"review_id": "tuRyPBJrlIC_Ierc56byQw", "user_id": "VH7nJ2DdP5onNpSUWy0lRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I usually like simple basic food that is savory and delicious.

You might think chicken and rice is pretty #basic but the sauce makes it droolworthy. My friend and I dine in store and ordered another portion to-go for our late night cravings. So yummy!

I tried to go to the food cart originally, but they ran out of food for the day because I got there too close to closing time. So I went to the restaurant location since it was open later. I'm glad for this actually since the restaurant is indoors and has actual seating compared to the cart.We got the dish they're most known for, the Khao Man Gai, which is chicken & rice, with a side of soup. The portion was a bit smaller than we expected, so it wasn't quite enough for my friend & I to share. It's a good portion for one person on their own though. We ended up getting another order to-go afterwards because we were still hungry, lol. I've had a lot of hainan chicken in my life at various restaurants, so I have a lot to compare to. The chicken & rice at Nong's was good, but not amazing in my opinion. I wished that the rice had more of the chicken flavor to it. However, what made me really enjoy the dish and what made it different from others I've tried before was definitely the sauce! It was a sauce that I've never had before. It had the perfect amount of garlic, soy sauce, ginger, spices, and whatever else they put in it. It definitely made the chicken & rice taste better!I wouldn't say the Khao Man Gai is the best dish I've ever had, nor is it the best hainan chicken (chicken & rice) that I've ever had (I like Savoy in Alhambra better). But, it is a solid dish that is good & satisfying."}, {"review_id": "uVS8BcWd2ZgFEcip7ggLgA", "user_id": "th9tnlFzJrtlCq54Bc3H9A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "I'm sorry food lovers and Nong... but I expected more. Perhaps I am a little biased as I am of South-east Asian descent so I literally grew up eating food just like this all my life. Did I expect too much? Was it all a hype? I don't know. I think the food and quality is in between a 3.5-4, but I'm not so moved by it that I want to keep coming back over and over again. My sister really likes the sauce, but I'll get back to that.First, I must say, Nong does an AMAZING job with the food. I ordered the popular Khao man Gai and that was good. Like from the execution down to presentation, to the taste, it was good. Really, really good. The rice was PERFECTLY cooked. Seriously. Sooo tasty and each individual grain was superb and had the BEST flavors of chicken broth in the rice. I'm sure they cooked the rice in the broth with some flavors. That was 1 of my favorite parts of the dish. Next, the chicken itself was perfectly cooked-- so moist and tender. A+ for nailing that! The soup... was soooo nostalgic for me. Seriously reminiscent of my childhood and my family and I couldn't get enough. Either it was chayote squash or something of that nature, the soup was done right, and perfectly. Seriously how I would've made it and how many others I know would've.The sauce...I know everyone loves the signature sauce. But was I the only one not blown away?? I mean, it was good, but it didn't blow me away. It had a great note of ginger, garlic, vinegar, soy sauce... but I expected more. Maybe something more addictive. But I just thought the sauce was good, but not so good where I want to buy the sauce and bring it home. I personally liked the food, but didn't think it was 5 stars where you must try it or else you're going to die missing the most important thing in your life. Maybe it's just me though. Overall, good service, great décor, and very busy. It was hard to find for me since I was out of town, but once I found it, it was convenient for the location. Street parking, and next to the ramen place."}, {"review_id": "cNU15O-DSA4iJesZLq9I3Q", "user_id": "jZTR-5gwO8Y_kbAwv99sqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I were visiting Portland for the first time and came across pictures of Nong's chicken dishes, which looked tasty and healthy-ish and wanted to try it out!

After watching her story, I quickly yelped it and bookmarked it. I wanted to visit the carts to get the most \"authentic\" experience but all the carts were closed that day and only the restaurant was open. However, it worked out for the best because it was quite a chilly day and it was nice to be able to sit indoors comfortably. My bf and I both ordered the khao man gai and a side of crispy chicken skins. We also both had a glass of mimosas (not sure if the carts offer this). We both couldn't believe how delicious a simple dish can be. The chicken was cooked so perfectly and the sauce was to die for. The soup was soothing for the cold weather.

I've moved to San Francisco, and tried several chicken and rice places that are similar, but nothing can truly compare. The atmosphere is intimate, and often packed. The fried chicken skin usually runs out by lunchtime, but for $11, an order of Khao Man Gai is sufficient for one person. I order the mixed meat, which includes white and brown meat, and a cup of soup. The sauce is impeccable, the soup is just right, and full of flavor. I honestly can't say anything is better. If you want to share the big sized plate for $16, I say it's plenty since the portions are around 1.5x as large. They give free ginger hot tea and cucumber water, which are both delicious!"}, {"review_id": "-OMMgUnw54389wYLuZ4Fbg", "user_id": "oEWmhHb4BlYGjmgRWSSbSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "There's no doubt in my mind I would be here on the regular if I lived in Portland! I still crave the Chicken and Rice here and it is such a bittersweet feeling knowing that I've been fortunate enough to have had it, but that it won't be in my reach for years to come.The chicken is succulent and juicy, paired with the sauce that's packed with tons of flavor. It's sweet, savory, gingery, and easily makes you want to clean the plate, rice and all.I'm from the Bay Area and we have a lot of good Asian food, so places like Pok Pok and Marukin felt a bit overhyped. Nong's, however, totally blew me away. How good is this place? Well... my girlfriend and I came to this spot for a late lunch, spent some time at Saturday Market, and then made our way back here again for dinner LOL. Came here twice in one day and our only regret with this place was that we waited to try it until our last day in Portland. Had we tried it for our first or second day, I easily would've used PostMates/GrubHub/whatever local food delivery app for Nong's every night as a late night meal.Tried their Pork Rice during happy hour as well.

I knew the next time I made a trip to Portland, I'd have to make a stop here. Luckily for me, my friends were very easy going and supported my addiction. This place's hainan chicken dish is unlike what you would find in So-Cal. Instead of it being prepared the Singaporean way, it is prepared with Thai influence. Nong's is known for their sweet and sour dip rather than the traditional ginger and scallion sauce. It was refreshing to see the dish prepared another way. I personally thought the sauce was good, but not amazing. The star of the dish was really the way they prepared their chicken. It was incredibly soft and moist...so delicious that I finished all of my fiance's leftover meat. The restaurant is relatively small so I don't encourage people to come with a large party. I came with a group of 6 and we all had to split up to eat. Everything is order at the counter where you'll get a number  for the food to be delivered to your table. It is street parking, so it takes a bit to find a spot. We were eventually able to find one, but it required a little bit of walking. Overall, I think Nong's hainan chicken was the best thing I ate during my trip.

It seems like it would be really authentic, but when you go inside the first thing you notice is that all the cooks are white hipsters. I have no idea what to think. I need to ask some Thai people before I have an opinion on the principles of the matter here.One thing I will say is that it feels wrong that Thai places run by actual Thai people have lower reviews than this place does.I also noticed my meal lacked spice and overall flavor. This could be a style of cooking I'm not familiar with? My meal was just a bed of rice, sliced chicken that was oddly soggy, and a bowl of broth. I have no idea. Like I said, this place confuses me.Edit: it appears the owner is a Thai woman. That makes me feel better.

The rice is seasoned with perfection that went so well with the chicken. We ordered the big plate to share but we struggled to share and wanted more.
