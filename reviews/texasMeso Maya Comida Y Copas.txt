The restaurant was moderately busy, but I was able to walk right in and get a nice table on their back patio. I was brought chips and salsa right away, and when I expressed dismay that I couldn't justify ordering guacamole for just myself (along with a full entree), the waitress was very kind and surprised me by bringing a corn tortilla with guac just for me to taste. This was emblematic of the very kind and quick service throughout. Since the restaurant ostensibly specialized in Mayan food, I ordered the Cochinita Pibil, and was impressed with the tangy, tender braised pork, which together with the included corn tortillas made for a very filling, tasty meal. The mango iced tea was a pleasant surprise, not too sweet, and free refills. All of the above factors, combined with the fact that they offer a nice little 5% Yelp cash back, makes this a very easy win if you are visiting or staying in the design district, Dallas."}, {"review_id": "r_uxPEUwjeZS1hb84wRLNQ", "user_id": "EGgB9HBvfw4udaQVSdSQcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Plano, TexasSolid 4/4.5 restaurant, great food, Drinks and service.

Firmly in the 3.5 camp here for now. Got a tad of 'tude from the hostess stand checking in as a one top for my reservation. Hey, if you don't want onesies then don't take reservations. Capisce?Chips and salsa opener was pretty good, the star being the salsa. Top shelf marg and house marg both good with fresh lime but top shelf lacked something for $12. Service was a bit staccato as I was relegated to a high top against the wall in the bar. Big gaps in attention. Friendly service though when they ventured by.Ordered short rib relleno and ensalada de la casa. Big gap then boom, both at once. Big no no. While I ate salad my entree cooked nicely, not good for gooey cheese in a relleno. Also, thought I was eating short rib inside a relleno but nope, on the side with a cheese relleno, I do not like them so much. I will say food is good to very good but not enough to elevate to 4 or more overall yet. Maybe next trip in will do the trick.....if there is a next trip."}, {"review_id": "IzjZUwKNfNpncjNeqXtlaA", "user_id": "K5sEuK5055nwvsGENc3cow", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "[Update: Just sat down to eat my leftovers and found something silver mixed deep into the brisket of my enchilada. It was yummy foil (at least I think). See picture. Definitely changing my generous 3 star review to a 2. Maybe should even truly be a 1 star review.]The chips and salsa here are amazing. The flavor of the chips remind me of corn flakes?? Idk, but very good. The salsa has an ideal consistency and a great, unique smokey flavor. However, the service was far from good. Aka we never got refills on the aforementioned chips and salsa. Worse too since we only got 2 small cups of salsa to share between the table. We only saw the waiter when he took our order. Of course he gave recommendations for the most expensive menu items. I don't trust recommendations when it just so *happens* to only be the high price items. Never got refills on our drinks. My dad asked anyone he could catch walking by for more dressing for his salad. Never got it. I asked the bartender that passed by us for more salsa...he seemed annoyed and never brought me any. Sure, he's responsible for the drinks and not salsa. But if he was a good employee and cared about the customers, he would've taken the 2 seconds to grab me one. Like I said, my dad got one of the salads. He wasn't too impressed. Might have been better if he got the extra dressing he requested. The rest of us got the mole enchiladas. They were good and tasted pretty authentic, but the good taste does not negate the poor customer service. Really probably deserves a 2 or 2.5 stars. I'm being generous."}, {"review_id": "ToQIAHeuQ0kl4nB2AI0BDg", "user_id": "ULs7M5Soyl0Js0rYAdY2kQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Came here late night by myself on my recent trip to Dallas.  The place was packed, but I got lucky with a couple people leaving and got a seat at the bar.  Started with the queso poblano which was delicious.  I had high expectations for the brisket enchiladas, but they were underwhelming.  The avocado margarita and serrano berry margarita were some of the best margaritas I've had.  I could have sat there all night trying different cocktails and food items off the menu, but I was exhausted after a long day of traveling.  Will definitely stop back in next time I'm in Dallas!"}, {"review_id": "Lkjolnf3ZLBOQcZL_XvjUA", "user_id": "Zv-tbv-250Ewntm-PqfWtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "This is a great place!

We loved the ambiance as well - so colorful and eclectic with definitely a South American influence as you'd expect!Firstly, the homemade chips were 11/10!!! And my out of town friends and I were sooo impressed by the amazing complimentary smoked salsa! We got the guacamole here per a friend's recommendation and loved that as well.All our food was SO flavorful and the portions were HUGE.

I love Meso Maya for their creative dishes, authenticity , clean yet complex flavors, variety , and fresh and high quality tasting ingredients. I think they have a lot to offer and I leave feeling very satisfied every time. My absolute favorite is the mole--- while I realize mole isn't for everyone, if you like Mole even a little bit this is the one to try! This dish is full of complexity, nutty, and sweet richness which is good on either the chicken dish or the enchiladas equally. Other great dishes include their Budin aztecas with cheese and tortillas layers and fresh delicious sauces, the relleno with the short rib is amazingly good as well. And don't forget to try the avocado margarita! It was a surprising favorite. And even though this place feels upscale flavor wise, I love that the atmosphere is not ostentatious and the prices are more than fair! This place is always popping so get a reservation especially if you have a party on the larger side. There is a lot of free parking in the lot as well as valet."}, {"review_id": "FWFA8GGnY9rpJ3YzaOTEPg", "user_id": "Xb41n6zWsNik5g7JGmU2uw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I love this place, I am a huge fan of the food, the service..from the hostess, waiters to the bar tenders & managers.

This place has more of a Mayan flavor than your typical Mexican food.  It was a very busy place but we did not have to wait long to get a table being that it was 4:45 pm.  I am sure at peak times it is better to have a reservation. I ordered the Avocado Margarita which sounds very weird but it was quite delicious so don't dismiss that drink.  It gave it a creamy taste but was not overly avocado tasting.  Before our meal came out they served chips and salsa.  The chips seemed like they were house made.  I am not sure if they were or not but they were very good.  The salsa was a very delicious roasted salsa that had a nice mild smoky taste to it.For the entree, I ordered the Chuleta de Puerco.  It was a bone in roasted pork chop with tasty red sauce, elote con crema (corn with cream), and zucchini squash.  The pork chop was cooked to perfection and the red sauce gave it a nice flavor.  The elote was better than any street vendor selling elote.  My companion got the Short Rib Relleno.  That came with a lovely cheese filled chile relleno and then rice and a short rib in pasilla sauce.  That was also quite delicious.  The wait staff was very attentive and our waiter had a great sense of humor and great suggestions to try.  I highly recommend going here!"}, {"review_id": "F-t8gKtRt6mwC5yzHr4t0w", "user_id": "OLGQ7alK4VKl3YdQk6UF5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Meso Maya Comida Y Copas was on my bookmarked list prior to my trip to Dallas. Delightfully, it was a very short walk from the Dallas Museum of Art. Even more delightfully, my group beat the happy hour rush and was able to snag the high-top table for four near the bar.Knowing we had other dinner plans, sadly we only got appetizers. I only say sadly because I thoroughly enjoyed the guacamole, ceviche and queso fundido. The fresh, hot, salty, crispy chips were mighty tasty as well.The standout item from my experience was the cucumber cocktail. Consisting of fresh squeezed cucumber & lime juices, simple syrup & patron silver tequila, it \"almost\" tasted healthy. It's \"almost\" a good thing it was hard to get our server's attention, because I may have had too many. That was probably my biggest gripe about our experience. The server was very busy and it was difficult for him to be attentive. He took my friend's drink order and I couldn't even get my drink order off my tongue before he was gone. It took another 10 minutes or so for him to return. That being said, we had some time between our drinks. By the time we left, there was literally a packed lobby waiting for a seat. Despite a little slow service, I was impressed with the cocktails and snacks. I can see why this spot is rated so highly, and hope to try some more of their menu on my next trip to Dallas."}, {"review_id": "vC-eYCce9cBhK9-jOskJxA", "user_id": "IOX4m9-sWTcjaqDy3r_O8Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I actually wasn't a huge fan of this place.

I had the cucumber it had patron and it tasted like cucumber heaven. For appetizers we had the chicharon fajita and wow cant even describe the flavors it was perfect. The entrees I had was the \"camarones a la diabla\" and i just wanted to cry of how delicious this was. My bf ordered chicken something cant remember red the name but see pictures .
