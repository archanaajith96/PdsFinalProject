The restaurant is very modern and chic and offered various seating arrangements.Our host and waitress were incredibly friendly and quick. our meals were delivered to our table in record time. the meals were priced fairly and the portions were generous.If we can figure out how to get in the parking lot again will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "W7kmVwMngzW3M5VM3HwUOQ", "user_id": "gT4dMjwetzngZfiNbO-G-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I don't know why people complaining about the portion of the food from here.I am an excellent cook and baker, I hardly find Chinese food good in Rhode Island but I highly recommend the food and the service here.I have tried several dishes, regular menu and lunch menu, take out and eat in. The portion is huge! I ordered the shrimp lemongrass, it comes  with 7 jumbo shrimps, load it vegs, a big bowl of soup , white rice and 2 pieces of chicken wings. I order a mai tai and the mai tai there is double the size from elsewhere. Most Chinese restaurant has servers that's not very good with English but the servers there communicate fluently. Everyone there chat with us like we know each other for long time.Try it for yourself and you wouldn't b disappointed"}, {"review_id": "0FKRGmEgeEVFr1oLLlBtqw", "user_id": "R5RQ2c-3Rjm-pcR5RR1LqA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Very disappointing, the reviews say amazing things but nothing I received was even decent ! We ordered the General chicken and Chicken stir fry noodles. Neither item had any flavor. The stir fry noodles were some of the worst I've ever had, they were like mush you couldn't even pick them up on a fork, they fell apart on the plate and just disinigrated in your mouth as you tried to eat them. I was also disappointed in the portion sizes for the price you pay for dinner. With the General we had 8 pieces of chicken the size of a quarter with one piece of broccoli on the plate. The plate looked half empty, I wish I had taken a photo. No rice was included or any side item. Very disappointing experience!"}, {"review_id": "NckwmoJtRBkmOWYU0v3r5w", "user_id": "TwgQb6iTLcBSs4hzErTRag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "This is a new Asian restaurant that popped up in town and my in-laws really were raving about this place. I had to try it out for myself since I was visiting town. The owners used to own the popular Seven Moons restaurant in North Kingstown. This restaurant is across the street from the popular Warwick Mall. They have a huge parking lot and the decor inside was very modern and clean looking. They had a variety of rice in glass vases as a decoration which was pretty cute. I ordered the combination pad Thai which had beef, chicken, and shrimp in it. This was pretty tasty and the portions were large. We also ordered crab rangoons as an appetizer; the rangoons were delicious. The outside was light and crispy and the inside was creamy and delectable; it came with duck sauce to dip in. My mother in law loves their ham and egg fried rice; she swears by it. Their crispy chicken wings were also delicious, it was double fried and extra crispy; it comes with peppers but my in laws ordered it on the side since they don't like spicy (my opinion, it's not spicy but I drink hot sauce so I may be biased lol). Overall, it's a great new Asian fusion spot and I'm glad to be able to see what the hype was all about."}, {"review_id": "YW_YBkmALbKJNsK11v6HSQ", "user_id": "r4PrM1JfEwfRuLDfQuvo8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Getting to the place you have to pay attention because u can miss the entrance.....We ordered the crab ragoons and gyosa yummy.... light and fresh.....

I was impressed. I am not all up in the Asian Cuisine scene, but I do love me some of the Asian-American classics. After reading the online menu and a few of the mixed reviews on Yelp! I was ready to try it out. The very first thing that we noticed was that the menu is LOADED with Peanuts. This is a huge downfall for us because Jason is allergic. I started my conversation with the waiter \"Before we go any further do you cook everything in peanut oil?\" He was so sweet and knowledgeable. Although he did not have all the answers he was happy to give us as much insight as possible into the meals and how they were cooked. He also promised that if we stayed that the cook would prepare everything in separate woks.Jason likes the classics and he ordered a General Taos plate, Wonton Soup, and Crab Rangoon.I ordered from the Yelp pictures. I literally said, hey tell me about this:\"yelp.com/biz_photos/red-… \" He knew exactly what it was, how it was prepared and was happy to help. It ended up being Phad Thai with chicken and it was the best Asian dish I have ever eaten. Call me crazy but it tasted clean. It wasn't over fried (like the side of the road places) or over marinated. The Crab Rangoon were hands-down the best I have ever had. Perfectly friend, not spicy, but steaming hot out of the fryer.To add, the dishes were plentiful and we split them among three people. I will be back for sure.The picture very clearly depict the food and atmosphere. Jeans are fine here.P.S. Hubby did not die so the cook truly was observant of the peanut allergy."}, {"review_id": "y3ubedA-jNb_y1OwihUPLw", "user_id": "Glwo5Ex5sjfYdnwTz8ePvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Super fresh--been here twice and had great meals both times.

Please note that you can't access the parking lot from Bald Hill Rd -  you need to drive down the intersecting street to get to the parking lot entrance, if not you'll have to drive back around. =)It wasn't too busy on a Sunday night and there were 6 of us, we got seated quickly and our waitress came over for drink orders. I was excited to see \"Red Rice\" Paella on the specials as the \"Seven Moons\" Paella was always a favorite of ours - so already knew that was going to be an entree. For apps, we ordered hae kainge, calamari and spring rolls. The best of the apps was the calamari - so much so we placed a second order. Nice and crispy with a little kick to it. Spring rolls were just ok - typical, and hae kainge was good as well.For entrees, we ordered several dishes to eat family style - Red Rice Paella, Crispy Thai Style Chicken Wings, Combo Bee Bong and Beef with Baby Bok Choy (we wanted peapod leaves but they didn't have any.) I was a little disappointed with the Paella - def not what I was expecting, not bad just different, it was really just a fried rice dish - plenty of Chinese sausage, chicken and some seafood thrown in. Everything else was good - again nothing phenomenal but good. Wings were plentiful and good - similar flavor to the calamari.We finished off with fried ice cream - tried all three flavors, vanilla is prob best IMO. I do have to say, the service is great. Extremely friendly and attentive and food came out quickly and hot. Food was 3 1/2 stars but service can bump the rating to 4 stars. The manager on site came and checked in on us a few times. Decor is very cute, modern and contemporary. If in the area, would def stop in again but not going out of my way to come here."}, {"review_id": "EIzVkdumv79_W3uC7eOBWg", "user_id": "b9_1trKf_eR5gk15oO950Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "I CANNOT believe this place has above 4 stars.  Went here for takeout on Saturday and the food was TERRIBLE.  The General Tso's that is advertised as \"chicken breast\" was dark, fatty, and in general did not taste good.  The pad thai was flavorless despite dumping sauce and extra lime on it.  The best thing we got were the appetizers, but even they were mediocre.  I have NEVER thrown away left over chinese food but in this case we barely ate any of it and then threw it out.  Waste of calories and $35 dollars.  Will never come back here and wish I hadn't."}, {"review_id": "nOPtDsOdG90-Z7k1OswjJw", "user_id": "c8uKbBPDPYfYaWCqxWwbcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "This is one of the nicest Asian restaurants I've been to since moving to RI.

They clearly know their menu and answer questions with confidence. My friend finally ordered the bee bong. She loved it! I ordered the curry Singapore noodle and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Their portions are big and we had enough to take home. I got my noodles with shrimp. They are not stingy with the shrimp. It's also mixed with veggies and I love that the noodles are thin.
