I know, hefty title, but trust me on this one. I've been coming here for years and I've tried falafel in multiple cities/states/countries but none compare to the experience of Amsterdam Falafel (you can't really compare them to the Middle East, but as far as Western countries go). What sets this establishment apart from the rest, one might ask. Well, they falafel are fried to order and pretty damn good. Yes, I'll admit I've had one or two falafels in my life time that are marginally better, but what puts this place over the top is their amazing toppings bar. If you have allergies, this might be a little risky for you because there is definitely some cross contamination, but if you're like me and are obsessed with toppings and sauces, then this is the place for you! Load your falafel up with as many dips, sauces, pickles, salads, and other toppings until your pita is bursting at the seams! Don't worry, somehow no matter what you put in your pita (or bowl), it always turns out delicious. I will say that their bowls are somewhat narrow (but deep) so it's difficult to get to the falafel at the bottom, but it's a nice (neater) alternative if you don't want to get a pita... but who could really say no to a good pita? It soaks up all the sauce! Anyways, come here for a great, affordable, and filling meal. Don't be shy, fill up the pita with all the toppings your heart desires and just dig in! Needless to say, this establishment is a DC classic. *Disclaimer: You will get food all over your face, table, and eating partner. Pretty perfect first date food if you ask me!Pro tip: get the fries and the peanut sauce to go with it, it's amazing (those danish style fries are not to be slept on)."}, {"review_id": "l8jtxvmYEYbI4JvGTRVYVA", "user_id": "LsOxwqxTNeZ9xHlzS2Vf9g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This is one of the few spots on 18th street where you can get food (besides pizza) quickly!

It would have been a real pita to give them a 1.What to get: Falafel, in pita, with everything that looks delicious (especially the spicy stuff), stuffed into it so completely that it moans with pleasure.It seems the Falafel doesn't fall far from the tree. I mean from the pita.I wrote this about 10 years ago. It would have been one of my very first Yelp reviews, but I never did post it. It went like this:\"Really rocks... giving you the choice of all these amazing things to stuff in your falafel - you can stuff as much of them as you can get in the pita, but you can't come back for more. It's cheap, and it's fair enough. Right in Adams Morgan, so lots of sexy people to share your balls with. Falafel balls, I mean. 5/5\"As you can see, even in the old, old, old days, I was making the same jokes and innuendos.The service can sometimes be pretty crappy, but the Falafel is usually good and the toppings are excellent. There is a massive selection and a lot of the toppings taste divine. Go for the spicy and the wet stuff because that really makes your Falafel what it is.There's not many better things that you can eat at 2 in the morning in Washington DC. Other than me when I'm in Washington DC. But that's another story."}, {"review_id": "C5J3co_CVWUeeM5O5i6k-Q", "user_id": "N9zSfJ3vUJcUTV4cflBvVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Hands down the best falafel I've ever had.

It was fresh as he made it on the spot and the serving bar... oh man... the hummus was SUPER fresh as we all as all of the other toppings. I piled them on and the server showed me how to maximize putting all the flavorful toppings on (by squishing the falfafel). Once i sat down and took a bite i was seriously in heaven.

Having eaten real falafel in the Middle East before, paying around $10 for a facelift sandwich feels like highway robbery.

Didn't even realize I had the place bookmarked based on reviews, which just made it that much better!!Came in on a Wed afternoon around noon, and the place was empty. Usually, that could be a cause for concern, but my friend assured me that it was quite unusual, and the place is normally packed. This was my first falafel experience, and I benefitted greatly from the 1 on 1 service, as the person helping us let me try anything I wanted before ordering. He was sooooo passionate about the food, and gave us great tips for building the sandwich - definitely 5 star service all the way!!!I got the small sandwich on wheat, and my friend and I shared a medium fry. Being a first timer, I was so glad I was with my friend who encouraged me to get alllllll the toppings. Yes, get ALL of them. Don't stick with what you know - just go for it! Why only get one hummus, try both! One sauce - that's for wimps - get all of them! A few toppings - don't be scurrrred - try every single one! Trust me, the flavor explosion in your mouth when you take your first bite will be unlike anything you've ever experienced!It was AH-MAY-ZING! Now maybe all falafel places are like this...but I doubt it. Ingredients were all so fresh, and as messy as I was adding the toppings, the entire food area was super clean. The falafel balls were crispy on the outside until the last bite - even with all the toppings saturating them. You can get more toppings throughout, so if you're halfway through, and feeling a little bare, just go get more using the little cups they give. (They'll even give you more balls if you ask!)And i haven't even mentioned the twice fried French fries. O-M-G. They were perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, salted just right, and worth every stinkin' calorie. Dipping in the garlic cream sauce, then in the curried ketchup - takes you right to the edge, then catapults you over it. So good! I don't get to DC that often, but this place would be worth the drive! My friend warned me I'd be thinking about this food for days. It's the following morning, and so far - she is RIGHT!"}, {"review_id": "166LIqgFPAUgU_xB_Xr36g", "user_id": "5_3n-2IM06s1fsw2mg8x2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "It's just falafel and fries, but boy, do they do those two things magnificently!  The fixins bar is expansive and includes a delicious hummus.

They give you your falafel and allow you to put your own toppings on, so you can really load up! I find their falafel to be a bit dry, but again, for the price and variety they offer it is pretty good. They also have a DIY orange juice machine, which is pretty cool.Now about those fries...they are SO GOOD. They double fry them so they are perfectly crispy, and they also have curry ketchup which is on point. It's also nice that they have outside seating, so I can bring the pup!

For such a cheap price, the pita sandwich gets you a handful of food (even with the small size option) and you will definitely leave stuffed. Lots of people say that this is their drunchie spot but I had it sober and it's still good. Do make sure to crush the falafel between your two palms before heaping on the goodies.Pro tip: do not overstuff. Simple is still tasty and picking up your falling toppings is no fun. Do try to eat in one location.

Once, I asked for a bowl for my sandwich because the heat from the food made it very uncomfortable to hold. A worker rudely informed me that they don't hand out bowls for sandwiches, and walked away. His colleague graciously asked if I'd like another piece of foil, to which I answered yes. To sum it up, good food, but sometimes inconsiderate employees.
