I stopped off at this little cafe for a snack and coffee. I always plan my stops out in advance of traveling as I need to make sure gluten-free options are available and the reviewers always review the hidden gems.This quaint and cozy cafe is definitely one of those gems. Dorothy took my order at the counter, and she was friendly and had more than one gluten-free snack to offer. I actually got to order a piece of Paleo coffee cake and it was to die for! I haven't been able to get a coffee cake out in, literally, years. This was moist and topped with pecans...plenty of cinnamon spice. I also got an Americano, and I can tell you that their coffee is superb.I got my order to go, but there were lots of little tables inside at which to sit. I regret I didn't take my phone inside to snap a few inside pictures because the inside was just so cute.If you want a great cup of coffee stop here! Gluten-free but wishing for a treat...they have you covered. Highly recommend and would stop in again...and again!"}, {"review_id": "bnv_iK3H9dNIhsBxmfiQ2Q", "user_id": "3ezIWOmdC-eYbnti6FJOFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "Hell yes. Everything about this place is awesome. The honey latte was delicious, the side salad and the black bean/goat cheese/ avocado panini (although I'd call that more of a flatbread quesadilla) was very good, but that paleo chocolate chip cookie. Omg y'all. I'm not even into cookies, but the guy behind the counter looks like a Viking and could have talked me into anything. He said it was the thing you try and wow. Softest cookie you'll ever put into your face yet still really rich. Will definitely stop here next time I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "maEH_s6YbFfvg3wwTi3b0g", "user_id": "5fUahb5uMC1G6ogBvppOug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "A cute shop located in an old house on Perkins. Magpie offers number of gluten-free, Paleo and Whole 30 options. From pastries to coffee, you are sure to find exactly what you are looking for. I had the herb chicken panini served with a side salad. Great portions and fresh flavor. I also had an Americano, which was made using Highlands Coffee beans. If these weather is nice, try to find a table outside. The patio is filled with greenery creating a peaceful escape from your everyday.  I did remove one star due to a lack of outlets.

This is by far my favorite breakfast spot in the city. It offers fresh and healthy breakfast options, all made from scratch! Their breakfast pastries are also good, don't miss their homemade pop tarts! Perfect spot to sit outside in the courtyard and have a delicious iced latte and healthy breakfast. Service is always quick and friendly, and their daily selections are fantastic. Haven't made it here for lunch yet but definitely will. Very affordable and great selection.

I would go so far as to say it redefined the coffee market in baton rouge.However, of late the standards seem to have declined. Cappucino cups are only filled up to 70-80%. The extra design touches are missing.Too much turnover among staff - earlier they knew you and you knew them.

Finding a parking spot can be challenging, but it is worth it. My go-to's include the latte and cortado. If you are also feeling hungry, they also serve food too. The interior is cozy/rustic and is a popular spot for photos (re: shiplap colored wall). For $3-5 for a cup of coffee, depending on what you get, the price is just about right."}, {"review_id": "GZtHawPrIzqXg5aTJ44u5g", "user_id": "0IdfzFwxhtQd0Trs5DWWSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2017", "text": "Great little spot for some java action. Corner location is amazing, street parking nearby was ample at 7am.   Lots of space inside means lots of room for socializing and caffeinating. Decor is very nice, light and airy with a welcoming color palette. Lots of natural light courtesy of the wall of windows. Super friendly staff and coffees are prepared very well. I feel I got a good value for my money $16 for a latte, two slices of paleo bread (closest to GF as kitchen is not certified but no gluten-containing ingredients) and a bottled matcha latte for the road. Make sure you call the right location though - there's one under the bridge that may have different items if you're checking ahead!"}, {"review_id": "xZE7Io7gBgFVqsdljMx0NA", "user_id": "ryP5rgpAKnGbtS0zamvpKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "This review is based on coffee - it's the best coffee I've had in Baton Rouge. I know there are places I haven't tried but after a couple disappointing experiences elsewhere this will forever be my go to when traveling to BR.This is third wave coffee but its not a stuffy place. Great beans - no over roasted burned flavor in the espresso or coffee. I like my coffee unflavored, unsweetened and delicious. Check... Pour overs - check. They don't oversteam/burn your milk. The staff seems to be well trained takes pride in their work.I also love that they also have a long coffee bar to sit at, which incidentally is a fully stocked bar if you want something a bit stronger.  Road warriors, Let me be your coffee advisor. I will not steer you wrong.Thanks for the great cuppa!!!"}, {"review_id": "EGZffJd8mVrZ25P6FVNsSg", "user_id": "pAL9RXb6dH35qspCB2j7bw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/16/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I really enjoy finding homey little coffee spots and frequenting them often. I love the area this coffee shop which is located right between Southdowns and Garden District in mid-city B.R. Parking is easier at this location then their new downtown location but I like the new spot as well. Anyways, this area has a lot of local little shops and restaurants, and it's got a great laid back vibe going on. I believe this is what I enjoy about Magpie as well. I haven't tried their lunch items yet, but I plan on it on my next visit here. I got a honey iced latte, it was pretty good, but it wasn't too flavorful, and I wish they offered more iced and cold drip coffee flavor blends. I look forward to trying some more items off the menu and spending more time just hanging out here."}, {"review_id": "zEOdyPGZEk5xtN2rOBO7mg", "user_id": "GeuFe_sl2bat54j3dMlpjA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Just alright.

The veggie one had 90% potato with gross piece of soggy spinach mixed in and warm section of avocado. The sausage one was that with a little unseasoned sausage sprinkled in.

I was staying at the nearby Hampton Inn, and while I was looking sadly into what used to be IPO, spotted the new Magpie Cafe across the street. Downtown Baton Rouge is still very much a work in progress, but slowly but surely it's getting there. Hopefully, this Magpie Cafe be part of the future Center City success. I came in twice. Once for Pizza night and the other when they opened at 7 AM for coffee. Service was very personable at door coming in, at the table, and leaving for the evening. Some of it felt like a just opened \"eager to please\" vibe, but behind that looked like a well considered business model. The food was excellent that evening, and by black coffee was good and strong in the morning. Much better than Hotel coffee.The space is large and casual. There's a well stocked bar in the back, a small private dining area to the left, and outdoor seating. The main room has a mix-and-match flexibility that should along a number of patron/private event combinations."}, {"review_id": "RiIgTG-zNTP0OlAzBTfxPA", "user_id": "CmG7H7BTZ_G_nv-DwyEbnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2017", "text": "I found this on Yelp during a drive to New Orleans. It's a perfect place for a lunch stop. When traveling, I like to indulge in yummy local delicacies with all the fat, sugar, and salt that's meant to be in them. However, if I ate only that food, I would have a hard time fitting in the clothes I brought. So! I search for vegetarian/vegan options and sprinkle them throughout my trip. They have lots of coffees, juices, pastries, and sweets. If you're looking for a more substantial meal, but they also have soups, salads, and sandwiches. I had a salad and a panini. It was light and healthy. There are lots of people meeting up with friends or studying. There were a few outlets. Free WiFi. Inexpensive.

They used to offer quality coffee, great service and a great atmosphere.  Unfortunately, I can't help but notice that magpie has deteriorated in all of these aspects. Over the past two years magpie has opened a 2nd location and the management/owners have  made business decisions to place greater emphasis on food. While, this change could have been welcome, it unfortunately has come at detriment to their coffee products. Magpie used to offer a rich variety of coffees for coffee lovers, and regularly rotate beans from different roasters around the country. The menu has been simplified so that generally the coffee house only carries intelligentsia coffee.  They generally feature one type of bean at any given time.  Furthermore, there has been a large turnover in the staff over the past year, a large majority newer staff generally are not familiar with  the  coffee on their menu. I'm fairly sure some of them don't even really drink coffee.  At the downtown location, one occasion I was attended at the register  by a staff member who was unfamiliar with the term 'pour over'.  This has lead to a decline in consistency of their products, since the barista on occasion isn't someone who really cares about coffee. The quality of the coffee served is still better than quick-service coffee houses, it is lack luster in comparison to other art coffee houses in the area. Magpie's competition isn't starbucks.It pains me to really write this review. I've given magpie a few thousand dollars worth of business over the past couple of years, however  the coffee scene in Baton Rouge has changed. Magpie isn't the only third wave shop in town any more, they certainly aren't the best. Most of the other regulars have already left. I'm not optimistic about any improvement as the customer base increasingly tends towards young university students that are indifferent between pumpkin spice latte rather than brewed pour over."}, {"review_id": "1DKcWhvGznP8ydu5a8HGyw", "user_id": "vFsE7d_3vAuz1uM-vF6fNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I ate here last week with my family.  This cafe is excellent!
