We had 17 people and Kendal did an amazing job setting the room up downstairs. Brian was excellent tending the bar and managing the evening. We had a fun cocktail hour and sat for dinner. The table was set in a square to that everyone could interact and it could not have been a better arrangement. The carefully crafted, personalized menus were impeccable and the lighting was superb for an intimate gathering. The service for unmatched, and the food was even better. Each plate was carefully crafted and balanced with a delicate, yet layered and perplex balance of flavors. Sweet, salty, with a good acidic punch to balance. Marvelous. The wine pairing with each course, delectable, and fun amuse bouche along the way.Epic night. Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "eTccbsXxRRnKeT3PQG7Vlg", "user_id": "QAMUxsZ0-atYwfzpKu7hXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Our latest Gracie's visit really felt like it missed the mark. Maybe it was the 'Saturday after valentine's day effect' but the service was not what we have come to expect (and value) in our trips to what we consider Rhody's finest venue. Understandably we don't hold this against Gracie's but did want to give them a good review for the night overall. As we sat, surrounded by many upper echelon types draped in their suits and fine clothing, we know we had picked a busy night. The couple to our immediate right was just nasty to our shared servers. The woman was irate when one of her dishes came 10 minutes after her last (instead of the 15 minutes she had anticipated). According to her, the plate that she had licked clean was also \"terrible\". Honestly, the entire evening felt like a major let down because that couple absorbed all of the hospitality Gracie's could dish out.Only time we've experienced that kind of behavior in many visits, and hoping our next trip will be much more like all the others!"}, {"review_id": "DZvkSckAi6immaWuESS5LA", "user_id": "dfRDPxWGn-zuJ179GdqpaA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Went there prior to the theater on St. Patrick's day with my wife.It was a very good experience.  My wife had the Prix-fixe option and really enjoyed her selectionsI had the foie gras followed by the rib-eye and cheese board for desert.  Everything was perfectly prepared and had excellent flavor and presentation.  Thought the rib eye was a little pricey at $48 but as I said, it was prepared blue like i enjoy and had a most excellent flavor.  The cheese board had some wonderful choices and variety from New England's best.Cocktails were truly innovative and flavorful.Service was great but not warm nor cordial.  Utterly professional demeanor which I know some like.  I would rather have someone not as stiff though.  The woman serving the bread made up for it though as she was funny and outgoing."}, {"review_id": "ihyRfmfQogq33oQ7f24xJw", "user_id": "IZdOv5CeOJz_VmLbcPMhdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Exceptional on all levels.

I've had chef Matt Varga's food before at some culinary events but I had never actually dined at Gracie's, besides doing the dessert tasting on another occasion. I always love his food, and was expecting an epic meal, considering it was New Years Eve, and advertised as an anniversary celebration and black tie event. We were all decked out in our suits and gowns, but I failed to see the \"party\" aspect of the night. Yes, there was a band, but no party hats, no dancing, and weirdest of all, no countdown. I didn't stay until midnight but heard from friends, that there was no acknowledgment of the new year. I just don't see why it was advertised as an \"event\". We were done with dinner and gone by 9:30.Although we had a reservation that we were on time for, we had to wait a good 20 minutes for our table. We were not in rush and did not mind at all. We were seated at the bar while we waited and ordered a drink. They had a special menu and were only doing their 5,7, and 9 course tastings, but unlike usual, you knew what was coming and got to pick between 2 options on some. We went with the 7 courses. The food was excellent for the most part, and there were a few stand-outs to me; the foie gras and the braised rabbit paperdelle. Then there were a few courses that my husband and I just didn't care for. I did expect small portions, but some of these were SUPER small. This dinner was very expensive. I just feel like for the price we paid and the small portion sizes, we should have been consistently wowed, and that just was not the case. Our table was very close to our neighbors, which I'm not a fan of. I feel like they need to remodel a bit. Our servers were very attentive. Our water was always filled and we were offered bread multiple time. By the way, the bread was pretty amazing. A couple of touches I really appreciated were the complimentary champagne macaroon at the end of our meal, and finding a little package of cookies in our car when we got it back from the valet."}, {"review_id": "ZUwfyzAW9LJ9nrNFvG6swg", "user_id": "DFKTuoFCW3eAN6psqrsCyw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Went to Gracie's to ring in the New Year and was surprisingly disappointed. For starters, they seated us in the basement without warning. Part of the reason you go out to dinner on New Year's Eve is because you want to be surrounded by the jovial spirit of everyone around you. Had I wanted to eat in solitude, I would have stayed home. We ordered the 9 course tasting menu. About 5 hours in, there were still 3 courses left to be served. Then, the progression was screwed up when they brought our dessert course out before the cheese course. When we mentioned it to the guys who drop the food, they just completely ignored it and left. Our server was apologetic about it but by then it was too late. The service overall left a lot to be desired. The second course, they placed the wrong option in front of me, when I said something, the guy looked at me like that was somehow my error. Luckily, we realized that someone else at our table had gotten the dish intended for me and we switched it out. Then, we ordered 2 drinks later in the service and were served 4! Again, when we mentioned that wasn't correct, the person dropping the drinks replied, \"well, that's what the ticket says!\" What kind of response is that?! Overall, I expected more. The savory dishes were delicious. The sweets were way too sweet, however.  The progression was slow. The service was lacking, and the ambience was completely flat for what was supposed to be an indulgent New Year's Eve experience. Also weird, there was live music all night but it stopped at 11:40PM and then there was no countdown! We got home and went straight for the cheese course which had been wrapped up for us. To say it was laughable is quite the understatement. Picture attached. When you're paying top dollar, you expect top notch service. That was just completely missing."}, {"review_id": "lPvxnA8mRxscG0JhhKUbEA", "user_id": "s7ypKeJatb0SIxdjL4MEFQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Terrible service!

Going back a second time with my boyfriend, I expected the same experience, but was disappointed.

The first time wowed me, and the second cemented this as one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at in my life. We went for my birthday, and received complimentary champagne, as well as a birthday card on the table.One thing Gracie's goes really well is the coordination between staff. They bring out all courses together and do not try to remove plates until everyone is finished. They know exactly when to come and when to leave us be. Gracie's has all of its bread baked by its sister, Ellie's Bakery. This results in a variety of bread options that all taste amazing and amp up the wow factor as opposed to regular table bread. Staff was knowledgeable and friendly, food was excellent.

The food was equally as impressive as the team.  I had a pre fix menu with a lust worthy selection from Scallops to Filet.  Every dish was beautifully presented and amazingly good.  EVERYTHING was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned and perfectly served.  My guests were all immensely impressed ~ yay.  MAJOR Fan!"}, {"review_id": "zYHwAAFDgXQA7b77cemP1w", "user_id": "A7_RUaX9r9CfNbPdhI_6Jg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2017", "text": "This restaurant is the gem of Providence!

The lighting and quaint decor offers an experience all it's own. While this comes as one of my best reviewed and most highly recommend, you will pay the price.... but in my opinion, it is worth every penny.I started with the handmade Russet Potato Gnocci which was melt in your mouth good. You could really taste the provolone picante. I chose the Filet for my main entree which was exceptional. Best filet I have ever had. The fresh spinach and pine nuts complemented the steak so well. Dessert trio was equally delicious. I was able to sample the chocolate Cremeux, Lemon Mousse, and Molasses Cake.

We were offered a choice of a 5:30 or 8:30 seating. We chose the early one, as we had no other plans, and I am glad we did since it was not crowded when we arrived and remained not too noisy throughout the several hours we spent there, enjoying truly good food and wine.I mentioned during the res process that we were celebrating an anniversary, and we were consequently treated as if we were celebrating something special, which of course we were.But beyond that, the service was just impeccably professional. NO ONE TRIED TO REMOVE A SINGLE PLATE PREMATURELY. I can't remember the last time that's happened to us. We couldn't believe they knew not to whisk one diner's empty plate away while another's was still \"working.\" (Another pet peeve: where did that ridiculous euphemism come from and when is it going to disappear? But I digress.)The food was outstanding. The only complaint is that the desserts did not live up to the entrees. I had creme brulee, which was overdone--not to say burnt, on top, and my husband's maple chocolate torte was dry, even with the yummy maple ice cream to swirl it around in.On the other hand, the throw-away just-cause macaroons at the very end were possibly the best I've ever had, anywhere. (I ate my husband's, too. I mean...33 years! I'm entitled!)All in all, Gracie's made this anniversary special and far exceeded our expectations.

We'd never been to Gracie's before, and thought RW was a great reason to give it a try. Things started a bit off. The staff, from the coat check/hostess to our waiter's assistant, seemed shy/timid. Not snobby, not quiet, but... shy. That's the best word I can thing to describe their demeanors. A little mousy; library-esque. As our meal went on, some of the staff seemed to warm up, become friendlier.Another oddity was the complimentary amuse bouche that kicked off our meal. It tasted like mayo. That's all. Just mayo. And... room temperature mayo. My husband thought, \"why didn't they toast it, or something?\" My thought was \"why did they serve it?\" It just wasn't good.But then, the meal began. Hit after hit! In course order:Baby Green Salad: Could've done without the potato chip topping (odd), but otherwise delicious. A-The Duck: Every bite was incredible. Every bite. I didn't want the dish to end. (Sorry, ducks!) A+Creme Brulee: Perfection. A+ Wine Pairings: Each wine was an excellent accompaniment to the dish. Hats off to the sommelier. In particular, the wine that joined the creme brulee... I really should've asked for a bottle while I was there, the more I think/dream of it. It was that good. A+ for all of the wines we enjoyed that night.It really was a beautiful night, with a delicious meal. Bummer that it started off a bit shaky, but all the more reason to celebrate how great the rest of the meal/wine/evening went.

They. Are. Phenomenal. I was there last night as a last hoorah for restaurant week. A $35 three course meal at Gracie's is a steal, so I saved the best meal for last--and it outdid itself. As a former employee in the restaurant biz, I know how restaurant deals can be a pain for waitstaff. You're extra busy, making less money, and often unappreciated by guests. This can lead to a less than positive attitude, which is why I am blown away by the warmth and hospitality we were greeted with by everyone, from the person bringing us bread to folding our napkins. And our waitress, Erin, was wonderful. She always had a smile on her face, and she was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable when it came to advising us on wines and making sure my (recently discovered) allergy was taken care of. I can't say enough good things about all of the staff. And then there's the food. It's in its own ballgame of awesome. Every dish was lick the plate worthy, and the portions are perfect (some restaurants that do prefixe courses make them so small you leave needing a hamburger, but you can't afford one bc you just dropped $80 for two pieces of cauliflower and a slice of smoked salmon). Gracie's gives you your money's worth, plus extra touches...a scoop of orange ginger sorbet, a post-dessert macaroon. It's the little things executed well that make a huge impact.
