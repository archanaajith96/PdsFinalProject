This place had a MASSIVE beer list - around 40 tap beers available and over 100 bottled options. You order from a numbered computer screen (order by number, it makes it easier for the staff). They only had a few of their own beers (Gandy Dancer Brew Works is a nanobrewery, so it's understandable), but we enjoyed what we tried. We appreciated the wide variety of Midwest beers that we might not have known of otherwise. They had an outdoor patio with live music the evening we were there, but we enjoyed their variety of indoor seating, too. They had really eclectic artwork throughout the venue, as well."}, {"review_id": "ZLSJ6KmUO07RHybJrDZnMg", "user_id": "lKSSl0QvZvHUaxCa0uxHtg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "We LOVE Monks!

Friendly bartender, nice selection of beers including their own brewery on site, various pizzas food-wise. I had the special pizza which included scotch egg sauce, egg, sausage, and mozzarella and I was thoroughly satisfied and took half of it home it was so big. Reasonable prices too.

The jalapenos are a nice touch as long as you can handle heat. No complaints here, this was pretty fantastic stuff."}, {"review_id": "XVzz3qV7VFAo2czLDo-R8Q", "user_id": "Ri4zt48PvIchv9FD_a7wLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/11/2017", "text": "Just had a couple of beers here on a Friday night.

With a scrolling monitor at both bar locations \"front, and back of house\" these menus keep you informed of their ever changing beer selection. I had a cream ale, and YUM! With hints of what seemed to be cherry, and vanilla this silky beer tasted more like a desert.I didn't try any of the food, but it seemed most the dishes coming out were pizza. It was a very nice place, The outdoor seating was a change even though the only view you have is of a train station. The front bar was kinda small, and the back bar area was very large, and open. I'd say this place is more of a \"hipster\" hangout."}, {"review_id": "pDoIG58kFu9U783SFJoGvg", "user_id": "F0N_aBPTVC1T--O_8VTBtw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Great selection of beers on tap.

Price is, not, ok. $17 USD for three 12 oz beers + a $3 tip, bringing my grand total to $20 .. during their 'happy hour' otherwise it would have been closer to $25. I am happy to pay for good quality beer, but it does not live up to the price tag. During the past 10 months travelling, I have sampled a lot of North American craft beer across 10 states in USA, and two provinces in Canada. To date, Monk's have been the most expensive and most disappointing overall. Their own brews of beer are ok, nothing special or noteworthy. The decor is nice, and the bar definitely has a cool feel about it, but not enough to justify the cost."}, {"review_id": "XPuPWuQ7h6jtPSVCsbmvgA", "user_id": "m4sYHnFQV0hwj7-_bhcFMA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "Really struggling on 3 vs 4 stars but I'm going to go with 3.  I don't drink so you're probably wondering why the hell I would review an ale house.  Well, my fella is a beer snob so that portion is all him.  They do have a bunch of beers on tap that you select from a tv screen.  Seems like a lot of effort to this girl who was A-OK with drinking Natty Light in college.  However, according to the dude, the beer was on point.  He's a bourbon barrel aged stout kind of guy & they still managed to accomodate.  I honestly didn't feel like the \"beertender\" was very friendly.  I've worked in the service industry & he just didn't seem like he was very into the patrons.  The place is definitely busy so folks don't seem to care that he doesn't seem to care.  We ordered mashed potato pizza & OMG, it was amazing.  I honestly wanted to order another pizza to go because it was so good.  This is not one of those bars that has food because they need to satisfy drunk people.  Get food here, it's delish."}, {"review_id": "dbXt3wsXa2QVi8HN_dp_cw", "user_id": "V7CbvXom1xtGvi08qsV1vQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "Great place, I came here during a down time but I can see the potential for this to be my favorite weekend spot....
