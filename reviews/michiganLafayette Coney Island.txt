Fine, it's actually not any of that stuff, but it should be, and no amount of vaporous bloviating will convince me otherwise. Quirky layout, vintage interior...utterly unique and adorable. Sit at the counter and rub elbows with cops, a fanboy or two, lawyers, hipsters, denizens of the street, maybe even supermodel Amber Valletta! Wow! A placard, fixed to the wall, states (I paraphrase): Payment is expected at time of service. I have never actually had a problem with this...maybe it just applies to the aforementioned lawyers. Yes, that would make sense. The food is simply divine, delicious beyond any reasonable expectation. I will tell you what and how to order: \"Bowl of chilli, plain, extra onions. Two coney's, loaded, extra onions. Can of Coke.\" Any deviation whatsoever and you and I simply cannot be friends. No. Really. Forget it. When finished leave a Jackson on the counter. Someone will be by shortly to collect it, do a bit of barely audible ciphering, state what you owe (just go with it), and return with your change. You are now done. Drop a nice tip. Leave.This is Detroit at its finest, most delicious, eclectic, multi-ethnic, variegated, best-ness.(parking sucks)"}, {"review_id": "lYVv8vqfcsfG6wQxxtSooQ", "user_id": "BwrccHlkp3xbIEZRIaAd-Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I'm no expert by any means, and not a Michigan native, just a semi regular visitor. But I think I prefer Lafayette over American.Perhaps it's because I get to have American more frequently as I have stayed at The D in Vegas several times. But something about the chili at Lafayette is what I think grabs my slight preference. I am a fan of both, but seem to gravitate to Lafayette when faced with the side by side dilemma.This is cheap grub that we always tend to consume after a long day of sporting events, bar hopping and beer. The service is unfriendly and incredibly fast. And again the price point is awesome. A Coney or two with a side chili cheese fries is my staple here.

It is served so piping, steaming hot that it can burn your mouth and tongue - even several minutes after you get it. It's also really tasty and really fresh. Probably up there with Duly as my favorite place to get Coneys in town.Of course Detroit is legendary for Coney Island Hot Dogs which is funny because it's a lot more famous than Coney Island (Brooklyn - the place Coneys are named after) for hot dogs these days. The Detroit virgins are actually a little bit tastier than the New York versions but not by much.My voice dictation changed \"versions\" into \"virgins\", how funny.

I came during a peak time when they're we're really busy. To compare the two, I ordered one from American and one from Lafayette. Switched back and forth with a bite each trying to distinguish the flavors from each. I love spicy food and felt Lafayette's chili had a tiny kick to it compared to American. I only blame myself for my previous experience with Lafayette. I didn't order with onions last time and I also added cheese. What the hell was I thinking? American does take credit cards and is more spacious, but Lafayette won this time. I saw my server carry like 7 plates on his right arm and hustling all night. I'll probably still continue to buy one of each every time I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "qroWD3_rDKBa4tiHCG6p3A", "user_id": "k6v0nKxASjFGeA5RCTsyjQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This place is small, we weren't greeted when we walked in and had to seek someone out to make sure we would receive service.

This place could use an update or maybe just a different setup and a deep cleaning. Customer service is clearly not on their priority list. I'm not sure why but I couldn't smell anything in here (not even food) which had me question eating here besides the place is old and dingy.

Gotta say my favorite thing about the dog was actually the onions. Perfectly cubed and sweet without the spiciness, the cold onions really made the hot dog taste fresh and snappy. Bun was pretty ordinary. 3 stars not because of the food per say (this place probably has good reason that its a classic so I won't argue based on my personal opinion), but because of the service. No clear waiter, unclear ordering directions, and worst of all, all the staff were extremely rude and hostile. No one ever made eye contact, and I'm sorry to mention this, but I was reminded of one of those street restaurants in Shanghai, where customer service isn't really important (but in Shanghai at least you don't have to tip). Not a single smile from anyone who worked there, and I observed that when the couple sitting next to me received an incorrect order of chili fries, no one even apologized (basically the reason why I didn't order more than just the Coney).looked around as well and couldn't find any indication that this place was cash only. but yeah, it is."}, {"review_id": "0zxFnXVS6EeD5AAVm7jcxg", "user_id": "6d1Ni9YOOr6mag8GdX5y8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "In Detroit with my girlfriend and I wanted to introduce her to a Michigan delicacy - the coney.The rest restaurant is the most divey of any diner you have ever visited.

Chopped onions and mustard balanced the savoury meats and chili with just enough acid and earthiness to create an excellent flavor profile.Unfortunately they place this excellent hotdog and chili inside a decidedly poor roll. The roll tastes like it is from Walmart.
