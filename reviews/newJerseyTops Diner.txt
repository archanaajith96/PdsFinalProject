I come here way too often and that is because you have unbeatable prices, huge quantities, great service and just a fantastic meal! Salads: All of them are great, cobb salad and hamburger salad are both amazing. My goal is to try all of them because each has made me so happy and filled my belly. The portions are always huge, fresh salads and fantastic salads. Theses salads satisfy both the healthy and fatty sides of my cravings.Sometimes they have free bread with butter - who can say no to warm fresh bread? Always a crowd pleaser and they will almost always refill the bread plate.My friend ordered the Chicken & Waffles, just looking at it made my mouth water, the waffle is the entire plate size and the chicken is super crispy and juicy. My friend orders it every single time and raves about how amazing it is. It is a lot to finish in one sitting but totally worth it. I could go on and on about the items here, you can order breakfast, lunch, and dinner and be so satisfied and happy. Will try to post more pictures from my adventures but please just go and check it out yourself!"}, {"review_id": "HzuMLP5h1kWa6YptK11QVg", "user_id": "DLo734sxAYCrH-RA8wmAoQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I came back and tried a few other items.  For my meal I had the Cubano ($13.99).  It contained smoked ham, pork, garlic mojo, Swiss cheese, pickles.

Sadly, everyone knows about this gem . It's not always easy getting in without waiting a while.Grabbing breakfast isn't normally crazy during the week. We got seated right away. I have to say the workers here are always really nice. I've honestly never had a problem with a sever, always super helpful and pleasant. For breakfast I got the huevos rancheros, they were delicious. Sour cream was fresh and a generous helping of if came with the dish. French toast was great too.I've been here for lunch and dinner before and everything is always above and beyond. Always look out for their specials too, sometimes they have great stuff. Don't sleep on the dessert either! Their cakes are ginormous and delicious. They put them out fresh all the time.

It was about noon on a weekday and there was no wait, so we got to sit down right away. I got an eggplant sandwich that from their lunch specials menu. On the menu, it said that it came with regular fries but I switched it with cajun fries. I thought it was a bit overpriced for diner food at first ($12.99) but when it arrived, holy cow, I definitely understood why. This sandwich was so TALL. I couldn't have picked it up even if I wanted to so I had to be pretentious and eat it with my knife and fork. The sandwich and fries were absolutely delicious. I was so happy I got cajun fries instead. I had so much food I ended up with leftovers. Both still tasted good as leftovers too. It's hard to do that with fries because they usually get so hard and stale, but these were perfectly fine.Overall, they had an expansive menu and I even saw a vegan option, which was really nice to see. The food was also delicious. Our server, however, was just ok. She said that my meal came with a soup so I asked if they had a vegetarian one. She said no, so I asked if I could possibly trade it for something else, and again she said no. Having been a server for a while before, if I were her, I would've asked my manager if I could exchange the soup for something else. So basically I just never got the soup that supposedly came with it. It's not really that big of a deal because I still do feel like it was a good value for the meal but that customer service aspect of it was just lacking a bit on her part. Why have a vegetarian option on that specials, if there can't be a soup or something else to go with it? The food is a solid 5 stars and service just brought it down a bit. However, the same lady that greeted us at the front was smiling again as we left and told us to have a good day."}, {"review_id": "98-5mn3p3wymLjGqCZQ_Rg", "user_id": "NqBYt9pw7kNoytFQ9ATS-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "I've never been to Newark but this is a pretty good diner! Highly recommend- there's parking. Mini line even on a Friday during lunch- come around 1130ish or earlier to avoid lines. We got the vanilla milkshake, burger, and quesadilla. The food comes out super fast and the portions are fairly large so keep that in mind. The burger was really juicy (there's so many to pick from- I think it was the jimmy). The quesadilla was filled with chicken and cheesy. I would come back for sure if I was in the area!

Let me count the reasons. 1. I've been coming here since I used to live in Newark in 2003. I haven't been here in almost five years but the food tastes just as delicious as I remember. 2. Because they're so popular and always busy, they have done the work to increase their tech footprint. In addition to their website being user friendly, they also send you a text with a link to your page for your table status. It tells you exactly how many parties have to be seated before you get a table--genius.3. French toast. Blessed.4. Chicken and waffles. Heavenly. They get 4 stars because they still have (always did) a couple of servers with attitude problems or who just plain ignoring you. Thankfully we ended up with one of the nice ones after our table was reassigned.

I can only attest to the quality of their breakfast as a virgin to the establishment. MC (my mother) was staying with us for the week (3 days past the usual 3 days she's allowed) and on the way to drop her off at the EWR airport, we decided to stop here for some good ol' send-off breakfast. We came in about 9:30a and the place was already in full throttle. They were only handing out the breakfast menu, which, not a problem since that's all we wanted anyway. Am really curious to get a peek at what else they have going on here.Breakfast Breakdown:George's Breakfast: 2 eggs, 3 applewood bacon, 3 pork sausage links, home fries and fluffiest pancakes, oh my. Eggs were good. None of those gamey tasting eggs that a well-frequented UES diner likes to shovel out. Pork sausages were like hot little fat explosions in my mouth. Loved it. Applewood bacon, I could do without. Home fries were spot on. The pancakes were just so fluffy with a hint of cornbread-y tasting goodness! They were definitely on point. The Husband and I are still raving about them (for diner standard, not regular pancake house standards)MC ordered the Farmer's platter which is pretty much an omelette inside a tortilla wrap. We did have a few bites of it and yea, not bad...doused with ketchup and hot sauce. A fairly healthy option if that's what you want to go for. Hot chocolate was a hit too and we all really liked their organic coffees. Definitely bold and refillable. Will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "MB-uw7ou69kvCpG9Y1HN-g", "user_id": "H2LL7msL41BQbS1YS-hktQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "I gave this place a try after seeing such great reviews and I was left very disappointed. Idk how this place has so many reviews and stars. I tried their Cuban coffee which was great!! The coffee was the only reason why I gave this star 2 stars. I tried their Cali omelette which was suppose to come with sour cream according to their menu. But as soon as I got the omelette, I noticed there was no sour cream so I asked the waiter for one right away. Sadly, I never got the sour cream. The omelette wasn't even that great. I wanted to get some hot sauce but not a single waiter came so I couldn't even get the hot sauce. I told the manager/waiter about the sour cream and he said come back next time, I will give you discount which was nice of him but just wasn't enough to convince me to return to this place again.Their service needs to get better for sure!!"}, {"review_id": "mZPXALwOm4IOIUQoDP0iXw", "user_id": "I2xm1Zy9UZOWwaxPfnsksw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "I pride myself in know about pretty well known restaurants in my area especially if they've been featured on FoodNetwork etc. So when I was at a yelp event the other night chatting with my fellow foodies. They couldn't stop talking about the world best diner, Tops. I was baffled that I had never heard of it. They said the lines are crazy but it's so worth it! So the next day I had to see for myself. I went on an off hour purposely to avoid a long wait. So 1:30 on Thursday I got the last spot in the parking lot and the wait was about 10 minutes. They take your phone# and constantly update you on where you are in line. It makes you feel like they didn't accidentally skip you and give your table away. So good job on that plus bonus for them they now have my information and can sell it to whoever they want since I willing gave it to them. Once seated we were greeted by our waitress who was quite the character. I ordered a Shirley Temple and my friend ordered ice tea. She even asked how much ice we would like in our drinks. I didn't like the Shirley Temple and she said they make it with ginger ale and strawberry syrup yuck I said so she just brought me a sprite instead. I wanted to try so many thing on the menu but I listened to my fellow yelpers who swore by the Maine Lobster Mac n' Cheese. Now I consider myself somewhat a \"Mainer\" so I now my lobster. I find that most places are lying when they claim this. I was shocked when I took my first bite and wow bingo! It may not be fresh lobster but it was Maine Lobster alright. The Mac was so beyond rich but the flavor was unlike any other Mac I've had. I think the star of the dish are those blistered sweet cherry tomatoes scattered throughout they really brighten up such a rich heavy dish. I brought home my leftovers and though when reheated it was ok it just isn't the same. So if you go this route just leave what you can't finish behind and take the memory of it with you. I ordered sweet potato fries as an appetizer. They flew outta the kitchen fresh and clearly freshly cut potatoes not frozen from a bag. The best I ever had. By the way brought them home too and reheated very well. My friend loves salad, not me but he couldn't resist ordering one of the specials which was grilled chicken, Brussel sprout, blue cheese salad. So fresh and the grilled chicken was even juicy not dried out from sitting around which is so often the case with salad. It was huge so he brought most home and since it's was dressed so lightly, the leftover didn't dog out over night.The only negative I found during this surprisingly wonderful lunch was in the ladies room there was a girl rolling a joint and cleaning her infected tongue ring all the same time. I was obviously disgusted by this behavior out in public but considering the not desirable area it's in what can the restaurant do about it really. The bill came to about $60 for lunch but I knew it was pricy for a diner going in. The thing is it may look like a diner but the food quality is anything but. Don't go here if your feeling cheap, they don't skrimp on stuff. So I can't wait to return here, only on off hours and never on a weekend. I just can't come to often since I have to pay a ridiculous toll to get there."}, {"review_id": "jOHD0C1AuRkl6QeDTWcmDA", "user_id": "6RZbd0Z1IA4VL6-VkwH1ZA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/25/2017", "text": "Literally this place is always popping, any day, any time!The tuna melt is hands down my favorite dish!
