Every meal I have had here seems like it has been made with quality ingredients. The second word that comes to mind would probably be \"truffle fries\" only because everyone keeps telling me that they are amazing. Have yet to try them though! I went in the restaurant today with my mother and had a veggie burger (it's not actually on the menu, but with the falafel wrap, they just squished it down to be a burger and put on burger toppings). My meal was pretty good, I only wish the aioli had a bit more flavor to it. My mom said that brisket was one of the best she's ever had. Her words \"I haven't eaten this food this good in so long!\" We split a brownie and it was very good/super rich. I would definitely recommend splitting the brownie with someone, because even split between the two of us, we were unable to finish it. Brought the rest home with me ;)"}, {"review_id": "y1f7tZDEB18natjYUckCPQ", "user_id": "QCsFXnHpfCWGNB0DiAEReQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Wow! I truly love The Green Well. It's one of my favorite spots for dinner in Grand Rapids. I loved the Seafood Escabeche Tacos and nearly passed out at the incredible flavor of the Michigan Pork Tenderloin Schnitzel. You need to try it! I've also had the Michigan Beet Salad, and enjoyed it too. I've relied on the staff's ability to pair a great wine with my meal; they've always treated me like I was their personal guest, whether I was dining with friends or eating alone. The wait time can be an opportunity to plan ahead but what great place doesn't require a bit of strategy?"}, {"review_id": "dv8YDHG881O8Ddkwi0nKoA", "user_id": "3XT_xWbKl-6V9EVPaa1JJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "Brought some out of town guests here on a Monday night. Happy we did!We had a nice table in the middle of the restaurant - half booth, half chairs. Service was quick and friendly - offered recommendations and did a good job catering to all 8 of us.Food was outstanding. The truffle fries are always a hit and the brussel sprouts were amazing. Hubby had a roast special that he literally licked the plate. I had the pork belly special and if i had room in my stomach, I too would have licked the dang plate. SO GOOD.Everyone else seemed to also enjoy their meals.Dessert was good - wish i had gotten it to go! Bananas Foster Bread Pudding.. YUM.

What did it for me?? Curry noodles. Amazing curry noodles. Gluten free and choice of yummy protein on top (I've had them with both chicken and braised pork- I recommend the pork). In addition, I have never never had bad service there. All the servers are well versed in gluten free eating AND they know their wines and cocktails well!  I can say mid tier light red, and the server can come back with the perfect wine. It's lovely.  This past time, I sat at the bar and the bartender asked how spicy I like my pork (when ordering the curry noodles). My response was \"meh\" , and he said \"say no more...\" The pork came out with just the right amount of kick; it made dining a pleasure to have everything just right. Can't wait to come back for more curry noodles!"}, {"review_id": "olQE3cv2cV30cYls7yjPBw", "user_id": "YgYYfZ4ZkWecFVXjsQ9iqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Always great food and service.

I don't drink, so I can only write about the food, ambiance, etc.I ordered the breads and spreads appetizer and enjoyed it outside on the lovely patio. It was a fantastic choice! The serving size for an appetizer was pretty generous. I wish I remembered the three different types of spreads that I got... The most memorable one for me was something like apple cinnamon. The bread also tasted fresh! I estimated the bread:spread ratio incorrectly, but it was no problem because I ordered extra bread to make sure I finished every little bit of spread.One of the best aspects of this place is the ambiance and service. The patio is pretty, and I loved sitting outside on a perfect summer day. Our server was also super friendly, and she provided us with plenty of suggestions for activities and other breweries in the area.I'd go back to The Green Well next time I'm in the area!"}, {"review_id": "ieGnPizTOtHE04mErA4eoQ", "user_id": "dJXcP8W1AEbGZDbblG-LHQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "The food is pretty good.

It was full of chunks of chicken, bacon, snap peas and ham. Covered in toasted bread crumbs and some truffle oil. I had the seafood escabeche tacos. Unreal.  The shrimp and crabmeat tasted so fresh.

However, we ordered the mac n cheese, Chicken n waffles, and a salad with grapes and feta. The mac n cheese was horrible. Chicken had no seasoning. The salad hardly had any lettuce in it. These plates were $20 each, ridiculous price for this food! Portions were not a good size for the money although none of us finished our food.

The quality of food is great and the presentation is is always nice.The standard entre dinner menu is pork heavy (just a note), but there are both sandwich and salad options to help balance it out. I would certainly recommend perusing the specials menu which usually suggest a beer or wine pairing. But if you are planning in dinning a little later in the evening be prepared for them to be out of several of the specials. It's worth getting there a little early if you are looking for something other than thier standard fare. Green Well also boasts a great cocktail menu, with a bartender to match. The drinks are innovative and mixed with lots of care. I am never disappointed with whichever libation I choose."}, {"review_id": "ZfguirBxAQSTWkG2VKtRLA", "user_id": "E99PmzemavhAxUMNOGKlWQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "$20 for a bowl of Mac n' Cheese?
