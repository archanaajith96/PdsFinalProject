Yes there is a wait deal with it it's worth it. If you want average food without a wait this isn't for you. Ok now to the review. I had the pancake with sausage eggs and bacon. I opted to upgrade the pancake with pecans and bananas and it was literally in the top three pancakes of my life. The portion was easily enough for two but I promise you'll power through that pancake no matter how uncomfortable you are it's that good.

Look no further. It starts with the hearts of those who work here. They like their job. So it appears, at least to me. This visit. This day. To some the place might look old, it is old, but it has character. But it is clean. And in my opinion any place that cooks and prepares right before your very eyes has little to hide. The cooks/ chefs here are fantastic and their well plated food proves it. Their motto is, \"like your mom made it,\"Well, yes, but my mom's cooking was very good. Decent coffee. Four different flavors of Smucker's Jam! Great gravy. Well cooked eggs. Friendly service. Not a good place for large groups. Great for solo diners. Family friendly. Only one gender neutral bathroom, but it is clean. Take your Lasix later. Be quick about your business, and clean up after yourself.

We went on a Wednesday about 9 a.m. and got the last table in the house. It's a small, cozy place but they turn tables quickly. You won't feel rushed however which is what I feared. The menu is lengthy with everything you could possibly want for breakfast. We both got coffee which had great flavor and was just strong enough without being jet fuel but not watered down like IHOP. The wife got the pancake special which includes one pancake, 2 eggs, 2 bacon and 2 sausage however she opted for all bacon. Great choice because the bacon was thick and smoky - super tasty! The pancake was awesome - HUGE! She even took some of it home! I had the choice of meat breakfast with 2 eggs, potatoes and toast. I went for the corned beef hash after confirming it wasn't homemade (call me crazy but I love the canned!). The potatoes were delicious. It was enough food to feed us plus two others. The staff was all working together, we never had to ask for a refill on the coffee and the food took no more than 8 minutes. All of the food and coffee was a little over $22. Great food, great prices, great atmosphere and great staff - Bobo's is our new favorite Tucson joint!"}, {"review_id": "73PV1iMJakNvL5GO_D2QFg", "user_id": "CZ-PaqA-uBxqpH01lWvxXA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "So I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.

This eatery makes them all look like an easy bake oven warehouse. While we did have a short wait for a table (10 minutes at 10am on a Saturday) it was worth it. Lets begin with the service. The waitress was very nice but not overbearing like some restaurants. The server kept our coffee filled as well as our waters. On to the food. Trust me, you dont need to get more than one pancake, my wife got a chocolate chip one, and aside from being delicious, it was about a foot in diameter. I had the chicken fried chicken with scrambled eggs, loaded home-fries, and a biscuit with gravy. It was excellent, on the same level of quality as Vivs Cafe in Bear canyon. The chicken was very well cooked, and very tender. The gravy had the peppery flavor we all look for in it, unlike the dong knockers at the Welcome Diner who serve it with watermelon (dont ever go there, food is crap). The home fries were crispy, and loaded with cheddar and onions. The biscuits were moist and buttery, as they should be, while not being overly heavy. This place is delicious and if you're a fan of cozy traditional breakfast joints, then you cant go wrong with Bobos"}, {"review_id": "1Y4R_07J51wdQiGf1HO2ag", "user_id": "MGkkr8cZJDHThfsd8dhv1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Very cute little diner.  Delicious breakfast, and wonderful service!  Takes you to a happy time in life.   Loved it!"}, {"review_id": "PsAmTy4mJA-yDZ4R-3Pv2g", "user_id": "ezmFWg_EoGCaUhKaLAx9BQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Bobo's is my favorite breakfast spot.
