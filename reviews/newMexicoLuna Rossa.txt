Pastas and pizzas are made in house and truly taste as fresh as it gets. I love artichokes, mushrooms, and prosciutto, so the Quattro Staggioni is my go-to order. The crust in every pie is delectably crunchy yet doughy.Each ingredient in the pastas has a purpose and distinct flavor. For example, this is the first Carbonara I have tried where the cream was subdued and I could actually appreciate the flavor of the egg. The pasta in the spaghetti dishes is the perfect texture for me: not soggy but far from al dente. The gelato is tried and true. There is a vast selection of interesting flavors and the consistency is firm and creamy without being watery. I love the stracciatella because neither the chocolate nor the vanilla overpowers the overall taste and balances perfectly. Overall, the 5 star experience is sealed by consistency. Every visit to Luna Rossa has been a pleasure from start to finish. I look forward to coming here again!"}, {"review_id": "MTOcdw8TaMoABmpcHvCH8A", "user_id": "aBUosRwNakD3tcQdXULVDw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Food was edible.

The menu indicates that some items take 15-20 minutes to prepare but in reality its actually everything. Waited nearly half an hour for a pizza and a slice of lasagna. Most of the pizzas are one or two toppings. The few that are three or more are all veggie. Substitutions count as extra toppings. Unless you want your pizza to cost $15-$20, just stick with their options and don't make a custom. We were ready to order and after I asked the waitress how large the pizzas were, she walked off to which I assumed she was going to get a pie pan to show me but then didn't come back. She wandered around the dining room and then came back to take our orders.The four cheese pizza was just a huge blob of cheese on a practically non-existent crust. Pick up a slice and all the cheese falls off. Might as well have been breadsticks and cheese dip."}, {"review_id": "ATj9rJByh3gEbzZE6yjNEw", "user_id": "N5EK5jSHIf91MnnYpQKQJQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "If you are doing a little wine drinking in Las Cruces and Old Mesilla then you should definitely make a stop at Luna Rossa.  Its located right off of I-10 on the main road to Mesilla.  My gf and I hit Luna as our third (and last) winery of the day and we both enjoyed our experience.  Luna offers a very cozy, home kitchen-like experience.   They offer food (we didn't try the pizza but maybe next time) and gelato along with their various wines.  We sat at the bar, and again, it felt just like sitting at a friend's kitchen bar.  We both ordered wine flights which were very reasonably priced and solid portion sizes.  Service was quick and friendly.   Note:  The Mesilla wineries in general don't offer much commentary on the wines themselves. The staff of the wineries, Luna Rossa included, tend to just pour the wine and move on which is a little disappointing but not a big deal.   After we finished our wines we both got two scoops of gelato.  I thoroughly enjoyed the pistachio and blueberry flavored gelato.  My gf didn't like her coffee gelato (it was a little too strong and burnt tasting) but she loved her strawberry cheesecake flavor.  All in all, we had a positive experience and would definitely go back."}, {"review_id": "kS37SDNvTI8m7X8q6zDnLg", "user_id": "T_kSBZ3Eci6FQdeavJ_bkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "$5 one topping pizza Mondays!

GO HERE! Eat and drink all the delicious things you possibly can at Luna Rossa! I tricked my husband into driving all the way to Las Cruces for Luna Rossa and it was the second best decision I've ever made (the first was marrying the man of my dreams).Wednesday night I got my husband loaded up in the truck and unbeknownst to him, we booked it to Luna Rossa. It's the summer in El Paso so even with the sun down it would've still been in the high 90º so we chose to sit inside. Inside was a little warm, but still 100 times better than eating outside even though I think a sunset dinner out there would be nice. The warm temperature inside turned out to be because the A/C was being worked on and about halfway through our dinner I was being blasted by the breath of God... I mean cool air.Much like the exterior, the interior is very simple. Tables, chairs, the usual. Nothing about it really stood out to me other than the fact that they had a large cooler for gelato and their bottles upon bottles of wine readily available. I turned to my husband and said something like, \"This is a winery that serves food.\" Because I didn't know if he was less than impressed by my dinner choice that was 30-40 minutes away so I wanted to be clear I took him to a winery that serves food and not a restaurant that serves wine... there's a difference (and also it would've let me off the hook in the event that we hated the food).To share, I ordered the Antipasto Misto. I was between that and the Prosciutto Melone, but I figured my husband might enjoy an array of options which is exactly what the Antipasto Misto is... prosciutto, mozzarella, bread sticks (think the extremely thin kind), artichokes, and roasted red peppers. It was all delicious and was the perfect sharable item for us. My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, but I came for the pizza so I went with the Diavola. My pizza came out a little more char on one side of the crust which I wasn't mad at because I know it's baked in a fire oven so it happens, but what blew me away was the fact that our waitress let me know that they'd be boxing up a second Diavola pizza for me for free. I appreciate that they didn't make me wait for my pizza since the majority of the first one was fine, but they recognized that it wasn't their best work so they were rectifying the situation without me even asking. They were going to get a 5 star from me before that so at that point I was just in awe.We also enjoyed a bottle of their Moscato while we ate. Loved it! It was crisp, light, and not too sweet. And it was only $17! Nice! And before we left, I grabbed a scoop of the caramel biscotti gelato... this is a whole lot of YES! The bites of caramel were so good!I would definitely recommend Luna Rossa if you're looking for a place to pick up a nice, local bottle of wine, a delicious dinner, a quick gelato, or all three! It may be a winery, but they are very family friendly so don't be afraid to take the kiddos for a treat too."}, {"review_id": "iwDUpsH6u0ZZvfLrgUft5g", "user_id": "i_8rPYXC-cwMpxd5jkaFtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/27/2017", "text": "Our visit to this location was a little concerning with the inside temperature being warmer than I like and a help wanted sign posted.....we ordered a bottle of Moscato a pizza and I had the Spaghetti and Meatballs. Our experience quickly turned positive when the limited staff was rocking it, an HVAC Tech was verifying the AC being fixed and the food was awesome. The pizza was very tasty and my meatballs were homemade! In addition to the great food, the waitress brought us another pizza to go simply because they felt our oven baked pizza had too much char on it.

They charged us for two scoops and not the price for two single scoops- totally awesome.There is patio seating, but it was too warm so we dined inside.  I had the Chardonnay the first evening and the Pinot Grigio the second.  Both are extremely pleasing to the palate and went well with my dinner choices.  Had a long conversation with a great gentleman who appeared to be either family or management who talked us into visiting the WInery in Deming, which we did the day we went to the Luna Mimbres museum.
