I really enjoyed their specially made rainbow trout, with pumpkin ravioli and a sweet balsamic glaze with a cream sauce, sooo delicious!Wonderful deserts! Also, they have an extensive gluten free menu.Be sure to make reservations! We went 730 on a Friday with reservations and still had to wait."}, {"review_id": "BE9QajiwE0SzEi_vpcGcpw", "user_id": "gKVFZfKUGXxCpASkodAcbg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Okay but nothing spectacular.  Hadn't been here in years until a few weeks ago. Went on Easter Sunday. Was great that they offered their regular menu, many places only offer special on holidays. Service was fast, a bit too fast. We barely had time to enjoy the table bread before the salads arrived, before we knew it the server was packing up my leftovers before my in-laws even finished their meals.Food was good but nothing great. We had seared sea scallops, swordfish & a lobster/white fish newbury dish.    Dinner was so rushed it was difficult to relax and enjoy it.   Would probably go back but not any time soon."}, {"review_id": "kRcYjA3z4jK96zTObw1zGQ", "user_id": "V6oP0ZS6Sb75xBLreTKeDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "In my opinion this is the best seafood I have been to. Even growing up in Maine, it's odd when I realize a place in Worcester has Maine beat. Some may think it is pricey, but considering the quality and level of service it is a real bargain.If you go for lunch, most lunches are between 10 - 15 dollars and they are quick enough to get you back out to return to work without being late should you go during your lunch break.My favorite dish here is the grilled Ora King Salmon."}, {"review_id": "ozD5m5cMwVkx6XcoXUTzaA", "user_id": "G9P3h7ZGdbdc_Zt6IKC2vQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "Butter poach lobster special (Monday to Thursday) - $25 - a fair amount of lobster for the price, plus you usually get french fries, coleslaw & a soup or salad. It's literally lobster meat in butter sauce with some light breadcrumb type topping. Yummm!!!Coleslaw - average - nothing fancy but still good. I got a double portion - if you substitute the french fries or coleslaw for any other side item, it's a $3 up charge. Lobster bisque ($8 up charge from the daily soup, and $1 up charge for clam chowder) - this was flavorful, not watery, and had chunks of lobster! Kudos!!! This was all to go. Parking seemed almost full, though there looked to be close by parking."}, {"review_id": "qX82ufW5NhUpN7xontzabw", "user_id": "m6DNW78s9Er1L8W3OoP0Vg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "We've gotten better seafood across the street at the Boynton for way less money than you will spend at Sole. We ordered the bay scallops w/ lobster bisque and lobster casserole. Bisque was excellent but for the price it better be! Scallops not so much, colleague did enjoy the casserole but said it was very rich.

The goat cheese cakes appetizer is sooooo good, crunchy toast and creamy tangy goat cheese. Toss in fig and balsamic drizzles and a bite of fresh spinach and you've got a killer mouthful. It's rich, so share it with your table. The lobster bisque has whole claws in it OMG. I did think the bisque was too sweet to be perfectly balanced but this is a well made, very rich, velvety soup. Fresh tasting and not a hint of fishiness. Bravo. Actually I suggest sharing a crock because it's really too rich to eat that much and then attempt an entree. Unfortunately it doesn't come in a smaller serving, but the giant chunks of lobster likely wouldn't fit in a cup. Our party all ordered different dishes: haddock with lobster newberg, shrimp, salmon, lobster salad sandwich, and scallops. Our group's veggies included spinach (yum!), butternut squash, broccoli, asparagus, I tell you, these chefs know vegetables. Excellent meal, highly recommended. Every entree was perfectly prepared. Nothing was over or under cooked and all the seasoning was on point. This is a great restaurant experience."}, {"review_id": "9k942BsKi7Kr41zmItOL7Q", "user_id": "2_EYogy3mqNkPFjJdQ9JuQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "We used to eat here a lot when I was young and always thought it was excellent.  We went last Mother's Day and it wasn't as good as it used to be.  The fish was fine but fairly bland and the veggies very soggy and not fresh evidently.  The service was excellent though and they have a decent wine list.  The oysters were great as well!

However the flavors of the tuna and stuffing were really fabulous together. My dining companions had steaks and seared scallops which they said were very good.  They made a point of saying we had 2 servers.  They both did come by frequently to fill up water glasses which is a huge plus. However I asked for my check from then one that was not the lead I guess and he said he could not get it and we waited 10 min before the other server came by to ask for it again.  I had a late evening meeting so that did irritate me."}, {"review_id": "MmaVxj0AKh3Ey4XaToQFng", "user_id": "XrEkDh19CR0s8Nf_v3JUBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "In town for business with my team.

It shows that they want customers in the seats, but can't necessarily afford the regular fancy menu. The happy hour prices and the menu were not that great, but we ordered 2 sushi rolls - a firecracker roll with lobster and a veggie roll.The bar was very busy but didn't match the rest of the restaurant which seemed very fancy. The service was pretty good and we were hopeful when we received our rolls. At first glance, they seemed to look ok, but once you take that first bite, one word comes to mind. STALE RICE. The sushi was not fresh and tasted like you got it from the local supermarket, which would have probably been fresher.The fillings were sparse and flavorless. In this place, even the happy hour is a rip-off. If you invite people into your restaurant, you should put your best food(t) forward. We will not be back here. After inspecting the bill, our \"happy hour\" prices were not that happy. $9 for a glass of wine and $7 for a beer!! And the bad food...priceless.

Parking wasn't too bad but it is limited being that the restaurant is always busy. My boyfriend and I made a reservation on the website for 5:30 but we showed up early and they still accomidated us. I overheard another couple had an hour wait so I recommend doing a reservation if you can. Food was amazing! We started out with half a dozen oysters, rainbow maki, clam chowder and a salad. The rainbow maki was delicious! There is just the right amount of cream cheese to melt in you mouth yum! For our entrees, I had the tuna steak Barcelona and my boyfriend had the seafood sauté. My steak was cooked as promised, med-rare (how it comes) you don't need a knife because it was so tender. I have to admit i took most of the feta cheese out, it was a lot. It didn't over power the steak. Sides were delicious also. The seafood sauté incorporated scallops, shrimp, and lobster with a squid ink pasta was delicious! Our server Marie was great every step of the way. Overall, a great dining experience.
