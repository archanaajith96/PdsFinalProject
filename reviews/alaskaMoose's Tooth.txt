I like to call it my home away from home. :)They have a great beer selection with revolving taps, specials that are super delicious and friendly, great staff. The only downside is how packed the place gets during their peak times but if you're patient and play your cards right, you'll have a great meal and drink for your troubles. Favorite app: Cheese BreadFavorite beer: YellowEye P.A. (Seasonal), Apple Ale (year round)Favorite pizza: Garlic Lover's (on thin crust)P.S.

The nachos and the cheesy bread with the Diablo sauce were amazing. We tried a couple of pizzas and the gyro (lamb) pizza was my favorite. Wings( Korean style) were good not great. The service was good and they were attentive even though the restaurant was packed. There usually is always a wait for tables.

And I can talk about (and definitely drink) their beer all day. But where they fall short is on the pizzas themselves. Yes, they've got wonderful topping combinations. Yes, there was a time when all I'd crave is their Chicken Ranch. But as my tastes have refined over the years, I came to realize that their standard crust is horribly inconsistent and not very flavorful.I've experimented with making pizzas at home and cold fermenting my own dough. In my mind, the crust makes up a significant portion of what makes a pizza good. Here though, I get the feeling that they're more about efficiency rather than quality. Which I totally understand from a business standpoint. It just rubs me the wrong way when people call this one of the best goddamn pizzerias in the country.Not to mention a serious lack of sauce on just about every pizza I've ever ordered from here. Which is a shame, because I happen to think theirs is actually pretty good. Even their Denali sauce is a winner in my book.Most locals will invariably disagree with me, but I see this place as distinctly average. Careful not to fall victim to the hype. Call me a hipster or a naysayer if you want, but at least I won't be contributing to the long ass wait times very often. So... you're welcome?"}, {"review_id": "_FBKgJuqBYI_1iNKzYGTqA", "user_id": "8NzUBQpgiu_o7777-lOj2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This place is a classic, it will most likely be the first place people recommend when you're in Anchorage. I've never had a bad experience with the food nor the staff. Everything is always exactly as it should be and the food is consistently great! Love taking visitors here and love the beer even more. Some of my fav apps: their sweet and spicy Korean wings, diablo bread sticks and blackened salmon Cesar salad. Some of my fav pizzas: chicken ranch, spicy Thai chicken, garlic lovers, amazing apricot, Santa's little helper, brew house favorite (with chorizo) Greek gyro, chipotle steak wild mushroom, roasted garlic and the backpacker. Fav beers: fair weather IPA, Hefeweizen, polar pale ale, raspberry wheat and hard apple ale. I also like to mix one of the fruity ones with the IPA."}, {"review_id": "LDyV5bknQ9S44tqwT0-2WQ", "user_id": "TTgWm6G6JSMWFjuCaE3jhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Haven't been here since 2009.

The place was packed both times I went within the week, and parking is always packed. Best thing about this place is that you can have two different types of pizza selections on one pie and any size pie! Pizza is pricey, but it's Alaska!A small pizza (4 slices) starts around $8ish-$12ish. Out of the 16 pizza flavors I tried with my friend, I have to say that the Roasted Garlic and the Barbecue Chicken were best! The Amazing Apricot wasn't that bad, just wish  they put a little more apricot sauce. The shrimp fiesta was probably the worst one I tried. I also HIGHLY RECOMMEND to order the Hungarian Soup! One of my favorite soups including homemade soups! Their wings tasted like frozen wings bought from the store; however, their sweet and spicy sauce is also one of my favorite sauces for wings!P.S. Their water is one of the best tasting waters I've ever drank!"}, {"review_id": "OcrsWBMG7_GziIdVgacwGQ", "user_id": "QL0lItCDmblgcvzYfSalzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "YES YES YES! Moose's Tooth is one of the top 4 pizzerias in the country. How is that possible?! I was so pleasantly surprised when the Alaskan family we stayed with took us here on our first night in Anchorage. We landed late so we didnt get to eat until around 9PM, but that was fine, since it was a 5 minute wait ;) I'm not sure what else I can add here, but literally everything is delicious - especially the meat pizzas. And do not skip out on moose pie. DO NOT. We were in Anchorage for a week and had moose pie 5 times. It was THAT good. P.S. Call of the Wild and Aloha Escape were the favorites. I personally was a fan of the Spicy Pepperoni. Also be sure to order the smoked salmon spread :)"}, {"review_id": "FSkXsI1HtvXjTrsCZIo2Fw", "user_id": "Z5KryuJSoCIAoft26Nq-yw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Moose's tooth is he best pizza in Alaska. Possibly best pizza in America. I just can't say it because i just haven't had that much pizza to judge.They have legendary musicians play at their venue and all throughout their dining room they have posters of heir shows signed etc on the walls. It's like a museum of awesome with pizza.This is a \"must go\" of anchorage and possible must go for Alaska. I won't talk about the beer because thats another whole review.

We arrived at around 6:15pm and were told it would be a 25-30 minute wait. We were actually seated in about 10 minutes, so that was cool. The place was very busy, but service was timely. I had the classic pizza, which is pepperoni, Italian sausage and mushrooms. It was good, but really nothing special.I think the beers might be the draw here. I had a couple of their YellowEye PA, and they were great! I'm interested in trying some of their other brews.

My husband and I split two of their pizzas and he grabbed some beers too. We had some of their special pizzas, they were nice about letting us customize them.

They are cheese sticks with chili spices and the most amazing chipotle and ranch dipping sauce. And now I'm drooling. We've tried two different kinds of veggie pizzas and they were both delicious.

I've heard nothing but greatness from the cheesy breadsticks at this joint! I've heard it from my Alaskan native boyfriend for an entire year! He's known to exaggerate and doesn't have a large food palette so I didn't have much trust! I've also heard sexy things about the pizza! To be honest.....the breadsticks were the sexiest things known to man! We tried all 3; buffalo, diablo, and original! When the cheese tangs this hard, it's unbeatable! Diablo is by far my favorite. I got so carried away i forgot to take pictures! It's going to suck terribly for me knowing I have to depart from Alaska here in a few days and knowing these breadsticks have their own life here away from me! *sad face*"}, {"review_id": "siJccS26fs4VJOraB6HfiA", "user_id": "hiAtNgJl_TspnvkK0jhDVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I cannot say enough great things about this place.
