We made lunch reservations a week before and were lucky enough to get a spot at the sushi bar. We had the chef special and our chef was Kez. Kez explained every single piece of sushi we ate and was super conversational. He told us that he trained for 5 years under chef Ota from 12pm-3am daily.Best meal I have had in a while. Highly recommend"}, {"review_id": "qaaALNjedbecTS-_DV7tfg", "user_id": "hFuyKEJKdJs0NqACqca-yw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I was a bit disappointed with Sushi Ota. I have had some high end sushi places in different cities and Sushi Ota was lacking behind nearly all of them. We ordered some medium fatty tuna and fatty tuna; both of which were disappointing. The portions were larger than normal, which was nice- but the overall texture and flavor were different than some other places I have been to. It was not a melt in your mouth texture, sadly. The Volcano roll was overpriced and overly sauced and the fish was hidden behind all of it. I probably should have just ordered all sashimi/nigiri as I do normally. The salmon and yellowtail were the highlights of the lunch and I really enjoyed both. Overall, I thought that Sushi Ota was alright- but overpriced and the quality was lower than what I expected. I have eaten enough sushi to know that some of the pictures that I saw on yelp were not what I got, so maybe I should have talked to the sushi chefs a bit more about what was fresh. Either way, I'll know for next time (if there is one)."}, {"review_id": "Gifh8rekhXxTXE9FjO3tBQ", "user_id": "vQjpwJs7CtoX4RF86TWAFw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Ugh...I'm going to make myself the least popular man in San Diego by giving a lower rating to what is clearly one of the most popular places in town. Here's the thing - its good sushi but at an exceptional price. Those two are not aligned. I've been here twice after multiple recommendations from multiple people who I trust and have faith in. But the problem is that those lovely people are simply wrong. They have that whole kitsch, 'we're in a parking lot next to a 7-11' thing going on for them. The decor is perfect - very Japanese, minimalist and tasteful. The service is ok - again, not great. But they don't necessarily have interesting rolls and the pure fish quality is on par with other restaurants I've been to and yet they have charged me half the price of Sushi Ota.Took the wife there last night hoping to have my prior experience be non-indicative and for her to tell me I'm crazy but she just completely agreed as we paid nearly $200 for what should have been a $100 meal. Two other minor things that really tipped the scale in favor of a lower rating: as we were leaving I couldn't help but notice an abundance of tables and yet...lots of people waiting outside. It must feel particularly special to have someone call your name amongst a crowd to be led to a special table but I've lived in NYC for years and years and that's called fake demand (Nobu, another vastly overrated and overpriced sushi place does this constantly) and its a load of BS. Secondly, when we got our bill, they list out the three tip option rates with suggested amounts based on the amount of your bill. However, I really think it should be 15%/18%/20%, NOT 18%/20%/25% - that's absurd. Secondly, they calculated the amounts on the full bill price, inclusive of tax. You don't tip on tax. It felt a bit 'shammy'. So load up San Diego and all our tourists as well - this review won't stop that but this place is not worth it and you can find other, better options although you may not feel as special, you will be getting a fair shake elsewhere and, unfortunately, not missing anything."}, {"review_id": "jTljLOyjF8JorpLXRwKjkw", "user_id": "CkqeeB57x39C61ClT7szag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Decent sushi, but doesn't exceed expectations.

The highlight for me on this visit was the GoldenEye Snapper nigiri. Topped with a small dab of yuzuand lightly seared along the edge of each piece thiswas a real winner. The smoky, citrusy combinationwas a perfect compliment for the snapper. Maybe the best 2 pieces of snapper sushi I have ever eaten.No need for wasabe nor soy sauce.  We also ordered a Spicy Yellowtail Roll (which had a yellowtail mixture in the center and was also toppedwith it) and a Sushi Combo \"A\". Enjoyed both. Service was excellent. Always a great experience.

Staff is friendly and service is great. It's quite spacious, but you do need to make reservations. The ambience feels like a Japanese restaurant, but none of the fancy fusion feel. If you like Uni or Amaebi you have to come here. Highlights: all the nigiri sushi!We ordered a bunch of nigiri sushi: salmon, tuna, amaebi, Uni, tamago, salmon belly, hamachi, and scallop. Everything was so fresh and sweet. I don't know how and can't explain it. You MUST come here and try it. I'm not from San Diego and I'm already planning my next trip to come eat here.Some cooked food we ordered included Chawanmushi, agedashi tofu, chicken Kara-age, fried rice, and udon. The Chawanmushi was another one of my favourites. It was cooked to perfect and they used fresh seafood. The agedashi tofu, udon, and chicken Kara-age was nothing special, but still tasted delicious. The fried rice was quite delicious for a simple dish. If you're ever in the area, do come try this place out. Make sure you make reservations!"}, {"review_id": "UB1wc9NnDg50McObXbcWxQ", "user_id": "zz-p13qe7pphd4JvYC3OTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Beautiful sushi experience!

Located in Pacific Beach, Sushi Ota is in the same plaza as a 7-11 along with other business buildings. Parking can be tricky as the lot can fill up, but there is plenty of street parking. Make reservations! It's not needed, but you'll want it cause everyone wants Sushi Ota! Very busy on a Friday night, but the interior is bigger than perceived.I've been to Japan where the service is incredible. Sushi Ota channeled that. The restaurant was busy, but our waitress was attentive. The food came out in a timely manner & nothing was amiss. Had their Dragon Roll [$21]. Yes definitely the most expensive roll we've had, but it was well worth it. The portion of the eel that's on top was very generous. The superstars of the restaurant was of course their nigiri. Let me start by saying everything was fresh, fresh, fresh-- this comes into play when thinking about Suhsi Ota's prices. You get what you pay for & some folks say this place is expensive, but the quality of the food is so, so good & worth every penny. Keep in mind nigiri comes with 2 pcs of sashimi over rice. This is a good way to taste everything without committing to 1 type of sashimi. The winner of the night for me was the Salmon Belly [$6.50] Simply put, it was the best I've ever tasted--even shaming Japan's entrees I've tasted. This goes for ALL the sushi I've tasted. Salmon Belly from Sushi Ota takes it all. TAKES. IT. ALL. Second best was the Salmon [$5.50] with a hint of wasabi on top, this is the best salmon I've tasted. Rounding off my Final Four: Hamachi (Yellowtail) [$5.50] & Hamachi Belly[$6.50]. Hamachi is my ultimate fave, but Salmon beat it out this time around.  Thumbs up for the Tuna Maguro [$5.50], Unagi [$6] & the Tamago [$3] Thumbs down for the Amber Jack [$8] Octopus [$4.50] & Squid [$4]. Wanted to try different things, this is on me & not on the restaurant.Sushi Ota, I love you! Keep serving the freshest fish along with quick, friendly service. Never change... You've got a friend/customer in me!"}, {"review_id": "1e0UjrO4pgUoDM3uGxrvrA", "user_id": "Rn9Wh68CojOvlqIWHFDrBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Best sushi I've ever had in the states.

We weren't super hungry so we ordered the bare minimum, so our waitress asked us a million times if what we ordered was enough and eventually left us a menu.We ordered a seaweed salad, an order of salmon and tuna sashimi which comes with 5pcs each, a black pepper scallop roll and black sesame ice cream. The tuna and salmon were super fresh and bright. I liked the salmon a bit more since it was a bit sweeter. The scallop roll was really good, my sister had one piece that burned a bit, but we think she just had a jalepeno seed in hers. I didn't get any heat from my half. The black sesame ice cream was only ok since the flavor of black sesame wasn't fully there. I wonder if it was made fresh since the little bits of black sesame ranged in sizes.I would skip the dessert next time and get more sushi.

She was adamant they hadn't changed anything ever and pretty much refused to check or be helpful but also told me she wasn't responsible. Of course, I have had a severe reaction and have been violently sick for several days. I believe there is something in the sushi rice (just also found another yelp review that says the same thing... could have been avoided if our server had any shred of respect for customers and could have checked)It is okay to acknowledge there may be cross contamination but it is NOT OKAY to charge me $28 for a simple salmon roll which made me violently sick and REFUSE to check allergen information with the chef.

I liked the fresh uni but our $200 worth of sashimi was blah.  The seared salmon belly was tasteless.  The sweet shrimp was bland too.  The battera was the worst in Southern California since I have tried at many other places.Seriously if you want to waste your money and enjoy eating cardboard then go here."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-ota-san-diego?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
