I'm from LA where we have an abundance of Mexican food.. so to find awesome Mexican food in Fort Smith is a real treat. Papusas are great. The maze (I probably spelled that wrong) for the tamales have a great fresh flavor. The red sauce is home made and yummy. Children's plates are perfect size and low cost. Read the story of Mercedes... It will help you really appreciate this place."}, {"review_id": "4N-Cxn9ctfrOZWgDuRZFCg", "user_id": "bklvA4iTSa7kBBuB7D6guw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "Overall experience gross!! I ordered the Robert Burrito, the meat was good I thought the sour cream , avocado, rice & beans would be IN the burrito since it was listed In description on menu. No it just little small piles on the place. It's a useless portion & tastes gross. The beans are a brown paste, there wasn't ONE bean. Just slop. Previous reviewer mentioned runny salsa. Very true but we liked the taste. My husband liked certain parts of his food like I did but for the most part he found it so gross that we had to leave to get him a 7-up cuz he was feeling sick to his stomach. This was a very very sad representation of Latin food. Actually I've had a hard time finding a good place!"}, {"review_id": "z8xzoDdlXo7W8rv_IJIofw", "user_id": "tHgV_0in43gxNHZMPdx1Xw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Mostly great, just one down side. I tried this place because I was passing through town on business and saw the great reviews. I ordered something to go so just know I didn't eat in house, but the staff was welcoming and accommodating while I waited. I couldn't leave a tip paying with a credit card so bring a few dollars if ordering like I did. I ordered a pork and cheese pupusa and the Fisherman's Wharf combo (seafood burrito and chicken flauta with rice and beans). They even included chips, salsa, and the slaw that typically accompanied pupusas. Everything was really good except the seafood burrito sad to say. The best way I can describe is that there was a canned or otherwise not so fresh taste to it and I'm a lover of imitation crab and store bought shrimp cocktails. I'd like to note that it didn't make me sick or anything, I just didn't like the taste. All in all, the meal cost about $12, and I'd definitely come back, I'll just try something without seafood on my next go around."}, {"review_id": "9pRHT1RIu7X6vVoQ_4ST4A", "user_id": "myESjst0acVUG8I48Ghnpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "A friend recommended this place to me because of my families love of Mexican food.

Mexican, El Salvadoran food, and Tex Mex are comfort food. We were visiting my husband's family up here and stopped in. Hands down the best chimichanga I've ever had.

The cheese sauce on top was a vivid yellow color, as was the rice.

I had the Mr. Chuck's Special and the pupuss,  which I had never had...interesting. Kind of like a thick tortilla stuffed with cheese... The Mr. Chuck's Special was pretty good. The seafood enchilada tasted like it had mostly canned seafood in it, but it was only like $7. The beans that came with it were super tasty. This place seems to offer more than the run of the mill Mexican food, so I definitely was impressed with that. The other three in my party all seemed to enjoy their food as well. It took quite a while to get our food, but it was quite busy because it was lunch hour. I would definitely come back again though. Decent service. Above average food.
