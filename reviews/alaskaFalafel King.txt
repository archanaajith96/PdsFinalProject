So tasty and so worth it. Not sure why more people don't talk about this place. Only downfall is it is not a great place for large parties, the seating inside is very limited. Also they close early, well early for me. I tend to eat dinner late. This little gem is best for lunch or take out.

The owner is so sweet and kind, and the shawarma and chicken pitas are to die for (especially with the hot sauce provided!) I have been here a few times and choose to dine in. He always insists on you paying after you eat your meal (again,very sweet man). This time, as someone came in to pick up a to-go order he informed them that they no longer take debit/credit cards as they once had. I overheard and immediately felt horrified as I had already ate half of my meal and only had a debit card to pay with! I quickly informed him and he was so gracious and told me not to worry and enjoy my meal to simply pay him later! After I finished my meal I ran to an ATM and promptly returned to pay. In short - Service and food is spectacular, but to just be aware that they no longer take debit cards! However; do NOT let that deter you from trying this great place!"}, {"review_id": "ZmXy1zD9pC4IyVG1ViEIgA", "user_id": "TWk1poox3hypIhv2KlgTKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/12/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm writing this to give everyone who loves Falafel King as much as I do a head's up. While browsing through \"For Sales\", I saw the establishment up for grabs. Naturally, went there for lunch only to be completely bummed that it is true. He is selling. He doesn't seem to be in any rush - so, hopefully we all have numerous chances to head over there for one more meal."}, {"review_id": "TYcgi5IaNkHNoMVRTKyNzg", "user_id": "TLRlAcSlpKkhGvP2nq7w6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/14/2016", "text": "Yes! Eat here! They guy (son of owners) running the place when we went in was super friendly. Our food was made fresh and it was divine. The place is so tiny but there are a few places to sit inside.

I'm an idiot. Ever since then I've been going multiple times a week, and the hardest part has been trying to find convince myself to go somewhere else for lunch because I'm always craving falafel King. I get the shawarma pita. I've tried the grilled chicken and the chicken schnitzel pita, they are good, but the shawarma is the best. Also, the grilled chicken and schnitzel take longer to prepare, saves time at the lunch rush since it's a one man show. The hours can be erratic but they are always open for lunch Sunday through Friday. I go back there for lunch and never have an issue with them being closed. The mother and owner has been battling cancer and going through Chemo so the family has trouble covering all the hours.Great food, friendly family. When the husband is working it is cash only, but everyone else will accept credit cards. I just keep cash on me, it makes me appreciate the true mom and pop feel of it. It's delicious. Pickles and sauerkraut seems like an odd addition to a pita but it's delicious. The tahini and red pepper sauce you get on your own are delicious. Easily my favorite lunch spot on Anchorage."}, {"review_id": "chFtvjDwLNaiGJrBCA8piA", "user_id": "rIKgR2yWEthigCQ0dzOQug", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/24/2017", "text": "This is my 3rd time going to this place during their advertised hours and they were closed every time.
