Just absolutely stellar creole food. I had the chicken and crawfish etoufee which was absolutely spot on. A deceptive dish, looks small, but sits heavy in the best possible way. Eating this at noon on a cold Massachusetts winter day will wake you up for sure. Came with a wonderful side of cornbread which is the perfect compliment to the etoufee. The main complaint I have about creole food is it's normally salty (probably because I'm used to receiving shit creole), but this food felt and tasted home cooked, I wasn't reaching for water. I kept reaching for another bite. It's a little hole in the wall spot, but this is everything you want if you're looking for a plate of the Big Easy in Massachusetts"}, {"review_id": "RewxEsy1uxfj29kuoKgv2g", "user_id": "yoYEh5Q-twJJG0VmPxOQLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "My SOUL is very happy!

Place was pretty packed and there were just 2x 2 tops left. There were maybe 20 customers total in the whole restaurant and two waitresses.  I stood by the door for a good while before the waitress led me to my seat. She saw me soon after i came in and sort of ignored my presence. She led me to my seat and had to wait quite a while until she came back to take my order. She wasnt very friendly, can't say she was rude, but it just seemed like she was annoyed that there's another customer. I looked around and saw that other folks had brought in their own beer and wine. There was a $2 dollar bottle fee or something to byob. So that's pretty cool. I ordered the shrimp and sausage jambalaya. Portions were definitely good, but this was certainly not a jambalaya. The dish that came out was a plate of white rice, with a shrimp and sausage gravy poured over it. In a jambalaya, the uncooked rice is supposed to be cooked with the ingredients and all the broth and vegetable juices get infused into each individual grain. The sauce wasn't bad. My water never got refilled once, and after i finished my food it took quite a while before the waitress came to give me my check. It really wasn't that great of an experience overall."}, {"review_id": "KX3izN6HFpE2lLKZT2-yqQ", "user_id": "aOPf3TAtxtw1mxgZLYG8Nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Welcome to the breakfast of never being disappointed.  Every single time I eat there, Big Mamu delivers.  Always awesome, always friendly and family friendly, the Clientell are as diverse a Springfields' history.  I love it."}, {"review_id": "pj847WHlM7VF_8d9pw6dvQ", "user_id": "FeiBea_GjGVLltCahIIHtg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "I very much cheated on Whole 30 for the cheesy bread, and DO NOT regret it!

It's a hole in a wall kind of place nothing fancy, but the waitress was very attentive and nice. BYOB I ordered the thunder jerked thigh looking for a good kick, but i can only give it a 3 stars. The thigh was thinning cut marinated in jerk seasoning. It's a bit dry and not enough flavor, even the remoulade sauce can't save it. And for 8 bucks the portion was a little on the small side.For entree, I have the shrimp and sausage jambalaya. It's more of shrimp and sausage in creole sauce over white rice. There's 3 pieces of shrimps in the plate, and they used baking powder to tender the shrimp so it won't shrink in size which I'm not a fan of it. The sausage has a great smoke flavor. The street cheese bread with corn was a great idea, but i think it'll taste better with butter roll then on a sour dough. Overall I'll rate it 3/5."}, {"review_id": "2M9NHVQcmt50mRONItUQkQ", "user_id": "2v4Uc8epq3uCHsamql6rDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I got the Big Mamou, fried oysters and bread pudding.

OhMyF***ingGod  I'm blown away. Ambience: Walked in and got smacked in the face with a glorious scent of spices and just in time, too, as only 2 more tables were empty in this small place. It was a little warm at first, but it cooled down soon enough as I watched a line begin to form against the wall for a table. The sound track's great for it makes you feel like you're sitting on a dock in New Orleans as the alligators play and the crawfish boils. Service: Attentive and friendly, they seemed a bit terse at first but I think it's because they were busy just being the two of them. They opened up quickly and became more personable, so I'm willing to let it slide that I had to wait a while for my check and to-go box even though the restaurant died down to 3 other tables besides myself. Crab Cake appetizer: The plate is sprinkled with a Cajun seasoning that's not spicy but super flavorful. A side of  cold salad made of black beans, corn, green onions and tomatoes - respectable and goes really well with the cakes. I literally got chills as I bit into this warm morsel. The remoulade sauce is amazing, although, the cake would be perfect on its own as it's not dry whatsoever. The light layer of bread crumbs is just the right amount to encase the main event in a crispy, well flavored home. It's, also, not a bad idea to pour a bit of Chef Wayne's Hot Sauce (on the table) onto them either (it has a pretty spicy bite that takes a second to happen. Haha). Chicken Gumbo: Just warms your soul with the first bite. Flavors are so deep and full with the okra, rice and tomatoes. I feel like if I were sick, it would heal me. Chef Wayne's Thunder Thighs Jerked: YES! This is some awesome chicken. Juicy and full of flavor from the inside out! Not sure if it's been brined or marinated or what, but damn. It comes with the same salad as the crab cakes where I discovered it has green onions (cause I didn't see any in the first portion). I think it's the same remoulade sauce that's on the crab cakes, but better... haha. So I'm not sure if it is because it seemed to look a tad deeper in color. If you're scared of spice, don't worry. It's actually not too spicy, but it does have a bit of a kick (in a good way!). There is an option to make this a meal by adding rice, veggies and corn bread which I think is an option for all the appetizers. Cornbread: I asked for a piece to try cause the people next to me were saying how good it is, and boy, they were right! I'm not much for cornbread, but I could eat a whole pan of this deliciousness! Fluffy and sweet - it would almost be good with ice cream! Haha. No joke. This place is BYOB and charges $2.00 if you choose to participate. Not bad at all. The prices are pretty good, too!I'd go back here in a heart beat!"}, {"review_id": "opOAd9GsOS5IfUtfF50tVw", "user_id": "IhmBr-yHC8xLjdnoq7O37w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Yes!
