We used the waitlist feature on yelp which was pretty awesome! This place is nuts on a Sunday! Great energy! Cute place! Our server seemed a little stressed but was very attentive. My guy and I ordered the berry stuffed French toast which was beautiful!!! And so tasty!! Very indulgent and perfect to share. We also got the traditional Benedict which was ok. It didn't look like anything special but the eggs were perfectly poached and the muffins were great. We had so little hollandaise sauce though!  We asked about it and our server brought us a soufflé cup with more!!! That made a huge difference. The grits were very tasty and a great portion size. I would have loved if the cheese was broiled on the top instead of unmelted. The coffee was really good. Overall great place with good energy!"}, {"review_id": "fQXCVpxbhS1IgMQxNfBX0Q", "user_id": "Hs9xKsfZNNiSl5ojhAN5vw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "I was hyped up when I used the no wait app and showed up and got seated right away on a Saturday. Then I waited and waited. Finally a server stopped and offered me water while I waited for my server. Now it was mad busy but giving the Saturday experience. I ordered a prosecco. Asked if I could just have prosecco and not the OJ or other juice. She told me I had to get it with juice. Now mind u when she brought the drink she brought the split of prosecco. So why couldn't I just get a prosecco again?I ordered the pancakes with bacon eggs n grits. The food came before the prosecco. Now isn't the fun part of brunch sipping your brunch beverage while waiting for your food?. When I pointed out my drinkless situation to the gentleman that dropped off my food, he shrugged. Bet. I see u. Now you done ruined my brunch mood. Drink showed up 5 minutes later. Food was average. Grits were little below average. Not worth dealing with the silly parking downtown even with free validation. Had leftovers in my fridge for 4 days. Threw them out. Wasn't bad,  just not great"}, {"review_id": "D7Kkx0io9ycGX3agMxa5Lg", "user_id": "UNm0ZSQjr6ZWRQ0rkXm5rw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "My third time visit while in Detroit and the experience has always been good.

When I stepped inside Hudson Cafe, I felt like I had walked into one of NY's super popular Sunday brunch spots. But even better, they use the Nowait app so you can get \"in line\" before even getting to the restaurant. This saved us 1 hour of waiting. The Yelp app is also linked to Nowait so you can easily take advantage of this feature.Food wise the menu is very extensive - crepes, waffles, pancakes, sandwiches and salad. We really enjoyed the omelettes, toast and coffee. I saw a few salads on nearby tables and they were absolutely huge. However the crepes were a little on the soggy side. I'd stick to waffles or the large pancakes.

As well as this place is the brunch head quarters (downtown)! Parking is a bleep, but that's just downtown period! But what's awesome about this place right around the corner you can take advantage of the parking structure first 2 hours free with validation at the Hudson cafe! Hey make sure you try the Apple walnut French toast/cinnabunn pancakes/catfish grits. Like so awesome I promise! Note: if you get a order of French toast you will have to order eggs or any other sides extra. Only pancakes will you get a choice of your side. They do have tv's beware since this is such an awesome place the wait is usually long. It's not a lot of space to sit so just give them your phone number and go next door to under armor or Nike and just keep updating the app. I would like to suggest on a Sunday the best time to go is around 2-3:30 pm not a long wait (usually). But if you haven't please try the place out it's worth the wait.

It's in a great location for business, but parking can be kind of tricky since you can't park on the street in front anymore. There are plenty of structures and meter parking nearby though!! I came with a group of four this past Sunday, I actually joined the waitlist before we got there because I knew it would be busy around 1 pm. I love that we have that option now! When we arrived we only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. I suggest looking over the menu while waiting for a table so you can order right away. Our waitress Aly was super sweet. Very attentive but not hovering. I ended up ordering the House-made Corned Beef Hash. This was my first time trying the dish and I definitely was not disappointed!!! Our food came out not too long after, which is impressive because they were very busy. My food was sooooo yummy!! I highly recommend the corned beef hash to anyone who eats here. The portions are HUGE here so either order half or come prepared with an empty stomach! I have zero complaints about this restaurant! I do recommend planning ahead of time because they do get really busy on the weekends. Also, they have the BEST orange juice I've ever had.

We put our name in and stepped out for coffee. You can check your spot in line with Yelp. FOOD: I tried to be adventurous and steered away from my normal inclination to Mexican inspired brunch. I ordered the corned beef hash (since St Patrick's day I've been craving it). It came....it did not conquer. The corned beef, 90% sure it's from a can. It lacked any kind of genuine flavor. FORTUNATELY, my knight-in-shining armor husband shared his Voodoo Benedict eggs. These were creative and unique; the chorizo combined with the poached eggs, a light Mexican gravy, over  the cornbread was delightful. This was not lacking flavor and I would recommend it. SERVICE: For as busy as they were, the food came very quick. The waitress was there when we needed her and was polite. RECOMMENDATIONS: Looking around, there are A TON of choices on the menu sure to please anyone. The chicken and waffles looked amazing as well as some sandwiches I was seeing."}, {"review_id": "QTS7CDt-tsG9Ci032yF6fg", "user_id": "8smB6L3WSMzRoerGwxcuog", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Friendly hostess and server.

The greatest part about that was being able to see how many people were ahead of us in line, and getting a text when our table was ready.  Once we were seated our server, Ally, greeted us and gave us some genuine suggestions.  She was kind and prompt, without being overly friendly or fake.  Good service is seriously hard to find these days, so I appreciate a good server when I have one-- and Ally was one! But let's get to the crowning glory of The Hudson... the Very Berry French Toast.  Now, I feel the need to preface by saying I am not one to generally order French Toast, no matter what topping it has.  I will also say that I generally like things sweet like chocolate or caramel... not berries!  Especially not Very Berries! However, the Very Berry French Toast at the Hudson is next level.  It was the perfect amount of toasty bread which didn't buckle under the weight of all the toppings.  It was an equal mix of fresh blueberries, banana, strawberries and their juices.  It was the delicate cream cheese filling sandwiched in between the two thick slices of French Toast, that was not overly saccharine but just enough to provide a sweet creaminess. This trifecta of toasty bread, fresh fruit, and sweet cream cheese made for fireworks in my mouth.  Go ahead, try it for yourself and report back.  Other people at my table had food too.  Cannot remember what, as I was too distracted by my own dish.  Everyone left with happy, full bellies."}, {"review_id": "dtAhhIp1Q2DaLsg-qnotvA", "user_id": "T8Ea2c9YOWFeDuyAwb13rQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "OMG!!!!!!I have never experienced such warm and great service,in a long time.
