Coney places are not typically like this (Leo's or Nationals)The restaurant had a homey feel to it a mix of modern comfort. Their is a table full of game boards along with a cute checker board table by the front area this will be good for the younger kids . We were seated quickly and our drinks were taken. Our server told us that their portions were large I liked her sincere honesty. Coney's tend to offer a little bit of everything which is great. So we tried just that a little bit of everything: buffalo Mac and cheese, blue angus burger, lumberjack omelette and grilled cinnamon roll (yummy with coffee)and onion rings- and of course I took pictures. We loved it all!!! The Mac and cheese came with your choice of soup and salad warning the salad was bigger than a normal side salad.The onion rings was also fried perfect it wasn't too greasy and it was crispy. The omelette was more of a burrito their was so much meat and veggies inside. The coffee was good too. We definitely had to go boxes I mean who doesn't want Mac and cheese as a midnight snack!! I Will sure be back!!"}, {"review_id": "mijG_SjRkhVBVFpMnOgG3Q", "user_id": "ZRptTXkhlBAdaKOD3RU1dQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I've never had lackluster experience at diners...  that changed today. Where to start... I guess the beginning.  This diner is quite big, with capacity to dine probably over 50 people.  When I went, there weren't even that many people, perhaps 15 or so.  Yet, they couldn't meet the capacity for coffee.  They have 2 coffee maker for the whole restaurant, and they only made like 8 cups each.  After my first cup, it couldn't get another cup for about 15 min or so because they had to brew another pot.  Oh, and it was quite bad even by diner standards.  Ordering... they get a lot wrong.  I don't know if it's the fault of the waiter or the kitchen.  I ordered my French toast with hamburger patty, but they brought me sausage patties. Apparently, they don't even have hamburger patty, tho they serve hamburgers.  I also ordered Texas toast w my omelette, they brought me rye and it wasn't replaced til I was half way through the meal.  It wasn't just my order, either.  I overheard that they had messed up order on the table next to me, as well.All those I would overlook if the food was great, but it was average at best.  I ordered chicken cordon bleu omelette, it comes w cheese sauce, which should be Swiss based.  This thing is yellow(not white), congealing, and drenched my omelette.  Which all have been fine if it tasted good, but it had almost processed taste to it.  It was quite repulsive.  I took it off the omelette and it was still lingering and overpowering the omelette because omelette itself was quite blend.  The chicken was dry and under seasoned, ham was so sparing that it was an afterthought, and mushrooms were just a filler with little flavor.French toast was not very airy, and it didn't have much flavor until I added syrup to it.  Only thing that had flavor were pineapples(underripe) and sausage patty, which I'm sure is packaged because it was greasy and over seasoned(if it was restaurant-made I think it would be under seasoned just like rest of the food)."}, {"review_id": "HMcGWEAsEWNS2NgzDCz4KQ", "user_id": "9fb6VGY2Pzz47iz0UGpu0w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "Tried to order a carry out for the family.  I was told they wouldn't let me order a Mickey Mouse pancakes kid's meal for my son, so I said I would need to cancel the order if it could not be completed as ordered. Needless to say that they would rather not have me as a current (and future) customer than to let me order my child a meal on the menu.  Poor customer service...do not go here. Kid's Meals cannot be ordered for kids who are eating in the carry out format.Good thing the Mickey pancakes were going to be a surprise, so I didn't have to see him cry when I found out the order taker would not let him have his special breakfast.  Shame on them for almost making a child cry."}, {"review_id": "Qf1el_ZCWVxKN1hWMLhNUQ", "user_id": "RmeHoRmvOrl1WE8yRw0wew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "When the server said I'd have enough for lunch tomorrow, I knew it was gonna be big and OMGoodness so delish.

It's a very at home style restaurant and it's extremely clean and nice on the inside and out. All of their food is amazing. I've tried like 5 different things on the menu so far, and let's just say that I haven't been disappointed yet. Today I had their Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese and it was delicious. Our waitress recommended to substitute the buffalo sauce for their bang bang sauce, and every one in my party tried it and was shocked at how incredibly delicious it was. The portion I was received was enough to feed a small family but I did not complain. I definitely recommend you try this and all of their other delicious foods on the menu."}, {"review_id": "8YNP-TMW5Ny4Vt3F-YsXIg", "user_id": "ehQaQcJ_BNOrYcr8O7b9TA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This is one of our go to spots!

Asked for a kids drink they gave me an adult size drink in a large foam cup which my 2 year old almost spilled. They didn't offer her crayons or anything to keep her busy. I Ordered the gyro platter that comes with fries and feta and onions and mustard and ketchup all mixed together. Too much feta and usually with a gyro I like red onions not white onions. Wasn't too tasty. Same with the Greek salad it was basically lettuce onions and a plate full of feta cheese and they already put the dressing on which I didn't know.

From the homemade hash browns at breakfast to the amazing homemade desserts after a multicultural dinner or lunch you cannot go wrong with anything you order on their menu or special sheet!

Usually I don't come to this part of town mainly because I'm always in Detroit or I go north. Went to see a movie at the new MJR location and my buddy suggested this place and I was like sure why not. All he said was you'll love this place of the best food you'll ever have in they give you giant portions. I was hesitant at first because he knows how picky I am when it comes to my restaurants and my expectations. We walked up to the restaurant and I saw this very bland building and thought oh well this is going to be much. We walked in and it was completely different than I was expecting on how beautiful looked on the inside. It was super clean and a complete remodel inside that I was not expecting at all. The staff was friendly as we walked in and sat us to our table. I went with a patty melt and some chili cheese fries and my buddy got the fish and chips. They for sure don't skimp out on size here for the price you're paying, which my meal was around $10. I was very surprised how good the food was in the portions which I had to take some home with me because I cannot finish it all. But after eating my food and the great service and the atmosphere of this place I couldn't deny but give this place five stars because how amazing everything was."}, {"review_id": "Y8E9IEuL3xM7B3o8Cv4YgQ", "user_id": "uaIjGEId3ezKtxrcE0Y_oQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Walking in you'll fall in love with this place no doubt about it but the food and staff will be what keeps you coming back for more!
