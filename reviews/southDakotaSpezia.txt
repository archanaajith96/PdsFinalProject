The food is wonderfully fresh, service is both quick and friendly, atmosphere is very Tuscan/Italian. The fresh warm Italian bread, oil, and balsamic slides you into a perfect zone for enjoying everything from their light salads, veggie, and vegan options to the more substantial pastas, meats, and cheeses. One of our families favorites now!"}, {"review_id": "6WB2Sf3mbr6PUD93_prNxw", "user_id": "vG0D-qigFM1kptAcUexvEQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Good food, excellent service, BUT SLOW and do not complain or risk the Managers wrath...Stayed at the near by Clarion Hotel and they strongly recommended Spezia.  Advised that it is a little pricey, but if you showed them your key they would take 10% off bill...  They assured us we were in for an excellent dinning experience.Well Clarion was correct about excellent food and service.  Unfortunately  after getting salad bread and drinks right away it was 40 minutes before we noticed no one in the dinning room was eating.  We stopped the bus boy and asked and were told that \"two large private parties totaling 40 people showed up and were seated in the private dinning area. We have lost some serves and our main chef was not there.  My apologies, but we are not staffed for the rush. Your food should be out shortly.\"We appreciated the insight and sat back enjoying the great bread. We  did notice they were working hard and even saw the Manager was out delivering plates and helping bus tables.  Our waitress was jumping in where she could and still providing us excellent service. We noticed that they were working hard and frankly we were impressed.I wanted to compliment our waitress and let the Manager know we saw she was doing what she could.  That it was not her fault they were not staffed to handle the private parties and we were impressed with everyone jumping in.   Nice right?OH my God.  Did I get an earful from the manager.  We we told, \"That there was no private parties and we did not know what I was talking about.  That whomever told us that was wrong.  That everyone was working hard and she was sooo sorry the service did not meet our expectations (while she rolled her eyes).\"  She then asked forcefully, \"What would I like her to do about it?\"  At that point I was embarrassed in front of my daughter.  About 1/2 through her rant the food arrived.  In response to her accusatory question, I simply asked if we could enjoy the food on our own.Good food with excellent recommendations from the waitress. Bill came and we had showed the waitress our key when we ordered, but she said she would have to get Manager approval...  No discount on the bill not wanting to risk another rant we simply left a 22% tip (again excellent service) and left.Got back to the Clarion and advised the front desk that Spezia was no longer honoring the 10% discount.  Another couple in the lobby  confirmed it was great food, but no discount.They say good service you tell three people.  Well get embarrassed at a restaurant you write a review on Yelp! so everyone can be aware.  It is good food and great service..."}, {"review_id": "k5OA5Mvl76-k5cKNMHK5Cg", "user_id": "tHqiLXjOfY2VDgnjeUKjYg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "We had a lovely dinner here.

Food over service & ambiance and hubby over me.Spezia was recommended to us by the Hilton Garden Inn. Being from out of town (even out of the State and country) we gladly took the advice. Always nice to visit a locally owned restaurant instead of a chain.The're was a 40 minute waiting list but we were able to wait at the bar with drinks and appetizers. The female bartender looked like the bartender from Anger Management (actress Brett Butler) but wasn't near as funny or quick. Rather desoriented and slow. But we got drinks and appetizers. The bruschetta's being very good, the cheese and salame platter ok. But coming from Europe we're always dissappointed in the cheese & meat plates. Both the meat and the charcuterie weren't special. The most outstanding was the spinach / feta (?) dip.After 40-50 minutes we were seated in some kind of a side room. Deserted, just a few tables occupied. No music, no buzz. And almost no attention from the staff. So.....dissappointed. Was this done because were tourists?My hubby fell in love with the duckling and I just ordered two side dishes. The risotto (perfect) and the grilled veggies. The latter being a dissapointment. The big chunks of veggies were more steamed/cooked and then grilled instead of thinly sliced and just grilled. The duckling was also very nice.We really had to wait long for service. Both at the bar and at our table. Sammi being very friendly, the bartender just....mwah.So I thought 3-stars, my husband considered the area and thought more like 4-stars. You can see who won.....(Note: I'm no native speaker and I find it hard typing this on a IPad that Kees changing the English words into 'proper Dutch')."}, {"review_id": "qtZE00o4XOK2Mzbzpwka1A", "user_id": "37HswRimgBEf7_US-c3CDA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/18/2016", "text": "Team dinner our last night in Sioux FallsLoved their Happy Hour wine selection - found a nice Napa Merlot & the rest of the table got beers & wines as wellCaprese Salad - I was sucked in by their claim that all their heirloom tomatoes were from an employee's very own garden.....unfortunately they didn't taste all that great - very mushyOthers at the table for fish dishes & loved their choicesPasta with steak was another tasty selectionToo full for desserts but with the nice HH menu & the variety of menu items, have to say we were fans"}, {"review_id": "XkkC13R7aGb0VLZ9zn1FqQ", "user_id": "QH9i-p3cvlI8G18PE4aVkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/14/2017", "text": "Very surprised.

I have been diagnosed celiac for 11 years & trust me I know which foods are worth buying & which are not! I have thrown hundreds of dollars of gluten free food away. As well as I am a very good cook! Might I suggest you look into purchasing a corn based pasta versus ones that have a rice blend in it! Quinoa pasta is an excellent one as well. The pasta I had tonight was over cooked & literally crumbled when I tried to eat it! Gluten free pasta is touch to cook & quickly goes from just eight to overcooked. thanks for hearing me out!

This was my first visit to their new location. We made a reservation and arrived 10 minutes early. The place was packed, but we managed to get seated 10 minutes after our reservation time. The hostess' and our server were friendly and as prompt at you could expect. I ordered the Gnocci Alla Pollo, with my wife selecting the 4 seasons pizza. My gnocci was very flavorful and well prepared. The pizza, however, left much to be desired. It was extremely dry, and seemed to lack and freshness. It was like a pizza you'd order at a bar that sat under a warming lamp a little too long. The place itself is okay, but could use a little more character or ambiance. It's mostly larger open rooms with music you can't hear over the talking. Would be nice to see them offer live music or something, at least on the weekends. Overall, the quality just wasn't there to justify the price for the dishes we had, but we may give it another try while avoiding the pizza."}, {"review_id": "2Day1N2BVmEEUIDsaPfLpA", "user_id": "w7uiIBFRRuwmIFc0y0ZfLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "I celebrated my birthday with lunch at Spezia.
