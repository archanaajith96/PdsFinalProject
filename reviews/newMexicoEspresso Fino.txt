The one thing that was a little bit frustrating is that it came up for me on a yelp search because it has outdoor seating. I probably should've checked more before hand but when I got there I realized the seating was just rot iron chairs on the sidewalk. Since it also is listed as a place that's good for studying I assumed that the outdoor seating would be a little bit more secluded than it was. The indoor seating is mostly stools and a very small table with stools.Despite the seating issue, the coffee and espresso drinks are amazing and well worth it.[After response from the owner: he is definitely correct about how the seating, arranged as he has it is a great format for meeting people, sharing space the way they do in France and Spain. And, he is completely correct about the side-walk seating. I think because I am on the bigger side, the chairs weren't as comfy as they might be for a more slender lady. All of that to say, the shop is amazing, the owner is lovely and kind and interested in talking and if/when I am in ABQ again, I will definitely get my coffee there."}, {"review_id": "Z3nJxyyy5IF3X7ccL_Eozg", "user_id": "YvpRhXI1tnt3l1yW8XzLig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "In town for a conference, so naturally I went to Yelp to scope the best coffee shops. I caught the owner(?) just as he was about to close up and he very kindly offered to make me coffee. We chatted over our love of coffee and he told me to let him know if I needed more espresso in the latte. It didn't! It was perfect... He wished me luck on my conference and I went on my way. I didn't want to get in his way, so I didn't really get to soak up the vibe of the shop. But it's cute, cozy, and cramped. I dunno that I'd run the gamble of studying here but this would definitely be my to-go coffee spot! Too bad I'm not from around here. Oh well! P. S. He also rinsed out my dirty coffee mug and even managed to do art in it! Which I gotta say, I never managed to do in my barista years."}, {"review_id": "bPzaSb7xG4WVg5C3wIZGQg", "user_id": "u8nHOiRxwmYowee7iSahZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great downtown stop for your morning caffeine fix. Prices in line or slightly below other dedicated Java joints.I found a super friendly barista guy manning the machines!! Easily one of the quickest wits I've bumped into in a long while. Bright spot in my morning, for sure.Prices were good I thought. My bill ran $6.25 for a 12 oz dirty chai and a decently substantial slice of cranberry bread, with a generous side of Mr Happy-Go-Lucky Barista. While a bright spirit may not show up on the menu, it is one of the best things for whatever might ail you.TIP: On street parking at the meters is free on Sundays. (Kudos to the APD officers who tipped me off to this fact.)

Enjoyed drinking a cup of coffee, while people watching near the window. The Chai was out of this world amazing, great amount of spices including ginger (which you usually don't get). The owner/barista was accommodating to my little cousin's weird requests. And I enjoyed him calling almost each customer by name.I ordered the cortado, my only qualm was the beans were too roasted, making it very bitter and not very balanced (I don't like adding sugar to cortados). But it was still executed very well. This was a nice treat."}, {"review_id": "ACByV5f6iFMeNf1DIr6RLg", "user_id": "-AfM3951JMnpL18QkQNRdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "I'd rate this as one of the best local coffee shops in Abq.

If you are seeking an excellent source of coffee, especially espresso type, you've come to the right place here!The barista, who i think is the main source and brilliance behind all these magestic drinks, he assisted me in my quest for the perfect blend of espresso and steamed milk.  I originally inquired about his cortada drink as other customers in line swear by it. He asked, What do i usually drink? I told him an americano or latte.  So he explained that the cortada is a small drink but super strong espresso, stronger than a latte.  So he said he would make me a specialty mix between the 2.  And the end result was flawless!Just the right amount of espresso to get my senses revived at last that morning without the bitterness. It was so smooth and creamy and i didn't even need to add any sweetening agent to take away the bitterness since it was already perfectly smooth.  Just heavenly and rich!  The one guy who explained it to me was right to say that its almost like a dessert!Its rare to see 5 stars averaged out after almost 200 reviews, and the fact that this spot has that, it reflects the true quality of product and service.  Super reasonable prices too!  My drink plus half loaf of cranberry orange pecan bread was only 5$! Thats less than a measley latte and croissant from Starbucks!Stop here for the best espresso drink in all ABQ!"}, {"review_id": "m5djCUxRsUovSToja1pcQw", "user_id": "GNTpscPNGmhea94MSJDywg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/25/2017", "text": "Excellent everything.

There's clearly a reason why Espresso Fino is the highest rated coffee shop on Yelp in ABQ, just take a look at all of these 5-star raving reviews.I always feel a little nervous going into a new coffee shop. Are they going to throw some coffee  savant terms at me that I'm not going to understand? Hot, iced, shaken, stirred? Will I forget what grande means? What's a pourover? Well, here, I experienced none of that. My favorite coffee order is a cortado. It gives me that energy I NEED without me having to basically chug hot coffee. So, the first time I came here, I ordered the cortado at the counter, paid, and told the business owner it was my first visit. He was extremely helpful! As he was making my order he told me what they offer and gave me the wifi password off the bat. He then asked if I wanted to feel \"awake or really awake?\". Of course, I said really awake and he upgraded the size without charging me extra!This place is such a downtown gem. The coffee is SO good. I also like how small it is. Definitely helps me stay focused when I'm working."}, {"review_id": "C96khNO8_ANdcjvIVkpNBQ", "user_id": "SaYpZZGMDH_icrxbon4DvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Espresso Fino is a jewel in downtown Albuquerque not only is Greg, which I think is the owner a wonderful drink creator but he has a passion for it and you can taste it in every cup he puts out  his attention to detail is what I like the most he always remembers what I want and he always makes it right every time.

I decided to try Expresso Fino for the first time today based on good reviews and let me tell you, I am so glad that I did! The atmosphere was very warm and inviting and everyone there was extremely friendly. The owner, Greg, was incredibly sweet! He gave me a discount since it was my first time and he also threw in a free piece of chocolate. I ordered a vanilla latte and it was just perfect! Also, if you ever feel like your drink needs something or just a little extra flavor, just let Greg know and he will happily fix it for you. I had such a pleasant experience at Expresso Fino and I will definitely be going back in the future. If you haven't been, it's a must try!

The owner I presume was extremely personal, or the staff member who was here was just fantastic. Our mocha and latte came out great, I've honestly never had a mocha prepared this way. I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but it's much different. Not too sweet, airy, light, but still a hint of chocolate that's a surprise. To top it off, they had some croissants that were free being a day old. Day old bread for free? Psh, any day.
