Main Course*Salmon BLT - loved it. The salmon was cooked perfectly and I even took it up a notch by adding some warm pimento cheese and sweet mustard that we had left over from our starter dishes*Caesar side salad with corn bread croutons - Simply genius and a great way to spruce up this common salad. I now need to find out where I can get these croutonsDrinks*Vanilla Paloma - smooth, nice hint of vanilla, I would call it very vanilla. Not for those looking for a traditional tequila forward cocktail*Red Hook - Strong! If you like Manhattans and Old Fashioned's then this is the way to goWent here on a whim because it looked like it was very lively when we walked by and it was the right decision. Sat right at the bar and enjoyed our meal and drinks. This spot is definitely worth dining at while in Nashville."}, {"review_id": "Uas61meN25_YAnmlskBg8g", "user_id": "ymMn8ozhv--YgZ8N0dqc8w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Had a business lunch there today.

Found a spot for 2 at the bar to get a drink while we waited. Even though it wasn't live, the music selection was good and upbeat. Surprisingly refreshing in a town of great live music. Ended up getting menus and decided to eat at the bar. So glad we did!!  Allie and Jamie are AWESOME. All of the bar staff work together like a well oiled machine. Allie was our main bartender, but Jamie was right there if she was with another customer. Conversation was awesome as they are super friendly and attentive.  Our food came out very quickly and was spectacular!  I had the pork chop and my wife had the hangar steak.  Both were cooked perfectly and the sides were great. We had a group of people to meet but made them wait because we were having so much fun with Allie and Jamie. Stop in and see them, you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "FeRZSPI8RYuJTb9wLZWSig", "user_id": "xGxxTnCpRihz4chLTwsdaA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "We enjoyed Mechants!

We had the following:-Truffled Popcorn (they brough it out for the table, complimentary)-Beef Brisket with BBQ sauce and cornbread, as well as coleslaw-Fishes (mojo, pice de gallo, jalapeno aioli, guacamole, slaw)The restaurant was really busy and we were visiting at an off hour (around 3/4pm in the afternoon).  I can't imagine how busy it must get t night!  I would definitely visit again and recommend it to friends!"}, {"review_id": "NpsZaCOoKZ7yc-xDpMRkJw", "user_id": "LuCFJorskfxt-I6VWO7Qew", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Located off Broadway, I recommend that tourists (and basically everyone else) stay away from this rip off restaurant. It is located in a great spot, on the corner of Broadway and 4th, right in the center of downtown. Keep walking when you pass it, and save your money people!The food was only okay. The salmon BLT that everyone raves about was super dry and underseasoned. Tots were crispy, but also underseasoned. The sauces were pretty good. The chili was the best thing we ordered, butits such a bizarre thing to me. This place seems classy, is fairly expensive, and seems to be focused on a cool bar atmosphere -- so why a heavy dish like chili? (As tasty as it was). The cocktails are incredibly overpriced, and small. The small swallow they brought me -- I sent back. They returned the exact same drink, fingerprint and all. I was disappointed, but the small taste they afforded me was good. The drinks are definitely a rip off, at least in my experience. Service was okay. Restaurant was slammed busy after a hockey game, and everything was a little slow. My server was very nice and polite. Only reason they are getting two stars, honestly."}, {"review_id": "_OZDkqajtsj-dJcY3y8_Rw", "user_id": "NpVggDu07s2zbrMUXD3y5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "It's a rainy rainy day in Nashville ... and what do we do?  Enjoy a fun meal with a great staff at Merchants Restaurant!

The old time concept and servers with suspenders is charming. After checking into the Renaissance we walked up and down Broadway and ran into Merchant's due to the yelp star rating. We only wanted a little to eat because we didn't want to get too stuffed before getting into our dresses for a concert later in the evening. It was so hard not to order huge meals because every plate we saw go by looked amazing. We decided on splitting the arugula salad, half tater tots and smoked wings. I'm not a tater tot type of gal but the house made honey mustard was so good! Half the salad was huge for me. The wings were perfectly seasoned and the sauces, especially BBQ were all so good.If I had more time in Nashville I would've gone back for a full meal. So much looked so right.

We ate upstairs, which is totally different dining experience than the street level. Downstairs is more of a Old South Diner, almost like a theme park, with staff in red suspenders. Upstairs has a more sophisticated menu and  service. Ambiance upstairs is also more subdued. Great crab cakes and pan seared local trout. Good cocktails.

The place was completely packed , but we were able to sit at the bar. Had a simple pomodoro spaghetti with meatball that was tasty and very filling. I appreciate their attention to service, even bringing sour cream and onion popcorn while you wait. Little details are always good, but the food has to drive it home. This is probably a tourist destination, but I would return, the overall experience and value are worth a trip. If I didn't work nearby I probably wouldn't come into town for lunch here (or anywhere in town) but if you are in the area or heading downtown this is absolutely worth a visit."}, {"review_id": "wFY7qExVkQa5RgW4bwUBig", "user_id": "iZs_JdYeY0nD1jRjnM5CsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "Located in the hustle and bustle of downtown Nashville, this is a great place for food and drinks.  We ended up sitting in the bar area downstairs for a more casual feel. - Manhattans - excellent!- Duck fat fried tater tots - Amazing but filling.   We got a half order and still had to take home some of it.- Soup of the day - the butternut squash soup was cream, flavorful and well seasoned.The best part!  The savory popcorn that's complimentary!"}, {"review_id": "aVmi2JRM1RcbEtGH6r1l-w", "user_id": "uNqc5ZlqQ8rmgLRBzuXZNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I booked a private dining room at Merchants for a surprise engagement party, and the experience was second to none.  Alexis made it easy to book and was quick to get back to me with information.  The staff all got in on the surprise and helped make this occasion special.  A special thanks goes to Heather, our server, who was as kind and attentive as could be."}, {"review_id": "rJY8n-qmFW3Daz349hlOfw", "user_id": "4MeyfdyeJ38A_wOKLapRMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "Omg the fried green tomatoes.

First, we went for dinner. They gave us popcorn flavored with truffle oil and Parmesan-absolutely scrumptious! I enjoyed the Soup and Sammy. The tomato soup was divine. It wasn't overly creamy, and was hot and yummy. The grilled cheese had several cheeses and paired perfectly with the tomato soup. When I returned the next day for lunch, I enjoyed the Salmon sandwich. It was also really, really good. It was flavorful, and fresh. I wouldHighly recommend this spot if you are visiting Nashville. The peach cobbler looks impressive, but was heavy on dough and light on peaches. I would not recommend the peach cobbler. Otherwise, the experience was flawless."}, {"review_id": "GFpvoYS2-q-lnpeQwHky3Q", "user_id": "mkOygeSt9TXbe5ETD4YeAw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "THE place in Nash for an upscale dining experience...here's why!!!Now let me preface that this review is for the \"upstairs\" menu which is a more classic steakhouse. The \"downstairs\" menu is more causal options like sandwiches. So upstairs has dark lightening with cool art and chandeliers. You can hear all the live music flowing in from Broadway. You start with cocktails and bread. Martini olives can be stuffed on request! The soft sourdough is served with incredible butter. So creamy and sweet. For apps, we shared Tuna tartare, onion rings and crab cake. All apps ok to good. The tuna knife skills were noticeably refined with a brunoise style tartare. But the best part of the meal was the main entree! The beef served at this restaurant is special. Maybe because it's regional? But it's such incredible quality. I had the prime rib. I wish I brought a second stomach to eat more. All the sides were fantastic. But you can't live with yourself unless you have the \"50/50\". It is half potato puree, half butter and cream. It's not too rich or too thin either!! It's a phenom. For dessert we got a creme Bruleè to celebrate a birthday. They gave us complimentary chocolate truffles. How nice of them!!I subtracted a star for minimal table decor, no linens, and the apps were only ok. But overall It was a great way to start a special night in a special town!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/merchants-restaurant-nashville-4?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
