This buffet, despite a few other reviews of the food being mediocre, is very special in its own way. I really like how they portion the food into little metal bowls.Anyway, this review is specifically for our server tonight, Stephen (I hope I am spelling your name right). He was exceptional. You typically don't expect much from servers at a buffet since you're getting your own food, but Stephen was on top of everything the whole night. He was prompt in taking our finished plates, refilled our water bottle thing quickly, brought out a very nice plate for our birthday person, and even came back another time with 2 ice cream sandwiches for the kids in our party. He was very thoughtful and made our dining experience here even better. Hopefully we will be seated in his section again the next time! Also, their gelatos are delicious... nutella & pistachio. Oh and the raspberry sorbet... yum."}, {"review_id": "ZMITZehCnUUtaOBi11vb-Q", "user_id": "ESQRqNQeBdiIBEjT4VtHCw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "#600...how befitting to write one for Vegas.  We went for the dinner buffet at The Wicked Spoon.  Thank you, Buzzfeed \"Worth It.\". At 7 pm on a Saturday, there was no line.  With tip, it was about $61.  If you don't normally have a big appetite, you're basically paying for the variety.  I think overall it was a good experience.  I enjoyed the ribs, truffle cream pasta, and the crab legs the most.  The Asian fare was just okay.  There was a veggie item there, forgot the ingredients but it was nice and spicy.  There were also lamb leg, bone marrow, and fried chicken (a bit too salty for my liking).  The noteworthy aspect of the buffet was the seafood section, where you can have the seafood cooked to order.  The cook took 6 orders at a time.  Each with its own sauce pan.  I had the crawfish and mussels in a bouillibase sauce (or white wine garlic sauce), adjusted to medium spicy and added garlic.  You can even bring crab legs to saute in the sauce...or you can have them steamed (no need to stand in line).There was a salad bar on the large side (in addition were fruits, ceviche, etc).  The dessert bar was huge!  Gelato, cakes, and candies galore.  Sweet tooth rejoice!Be prepared to spend at least 2-1/2 hours gorging...haha."}, {"review_id": "Jk18CFQP1nBhj8vlMNhbFQ", "user_id": "huuC-qfooYY9kBIyLRxSzg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Food: The food was more filling than satisfying.

We chose from a variety of Asian, American and breakfast including prime rib!  The desserts and gelato was amazing!

Some of the side dishes could of been a little bit warmer but other than that I don't have any real complaints. The drink package for 2-hours for an additional fee was a good idea because it included 'Moscow Mules' and I was throwing them back as quick as possible.

Our server was extremely nice and constantly kept refilling my bottomless mimosas without me asking. He even gave me a to-go cup filled with mimosa to take with me on the go. Awesome service!The place was clean and nicely decorated. There was also a variety of food- from your typical american breakfast, to prime rib, truffle pasta, mexican pork pozole, chinese dim sum, etc. There was also a huge island of desserts!

The Wicked Spoon is located on floor 2 of the Cosmopolitan, directly next to Rose Rabbit Lie.

Prices for the buffet vary based on the meal and also by the day. We went on the weekend and it was $49.00 per person plus tax and gratuity per adult. It is a little steep on the price, but in my opinion it is worth it for the food quality and variety.They have the standard salad, cheese, fruit presentation to start, along with various small plate appetizers. They have a variety of seafood and pastas, and pizza. They then have a variety of Asian items (one of my favorites!)They also have a very large dessert/pastry presentation, be sure to take advantage!

The first time was good, this time it was okay. I am comparing this buffet to Bacchanal (my favorite). I recommend you eat here if you're staying at the Cosmopolitan, that's the only reason why we came here for dinner. We came here for dinner on a Wednesday night, short line, it was easy and convenient. The ambiance was cute, not as shiny and posh as it should be. I also wish the presentation of the food was better. Wicked Spoon doesn't have a good selection on meat or variety of food that kids would eat. I think the best thing here is the bone marrow! They drizzle a bbq sauce on it and it just so delicious. Other than that, they have a good dessert station with gelato. This buffet isn't bad, it's just alright and nothing to go crazy about. If we book a room at Cosmo again, I might come here for lunch but definitely not dinner. I would definitely choose Bacchanal over Wicked Spoon if you aren't concerned about the price."}, {"review_id": "1FQm4cwPAp_0XGOU4tGJAg", "user_id": "HbyHhB6WOSQjU-JYwED9Ww", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "As grandiose as Las Vegas is known for their buffets, I'd say that Wicked Spoon is about average considering all the other buffet competitions nearby. Now if it were located in any other metropolis other than Las Vegas, it would definitely hit a higher mark simply because it's still a great buffet. But competition in LV be stiff tho. Located inside the Cosmopolitan, the entrance is as swanky and flashy as can be. Being my first time ever in Vegas (Yes, I'm a late bloomer), I was excited to try it out.We met up with some Yelp buddies and got seated pretty quickly. We grabbed our plates and forks and headed into town!At first glance, the selections looked vast and plentiful, but come to find out, it was just decent. The bone marrow only had a thin skin of marrow inside and the bone was cut in half. Like whyyyy so skimpy? My fried chicken was a bit dry from sitting under the heat lamps. The seafood section was lacking tons of fresh shrimp and crab. The brunch section was really sad too. Just sliced bread, oatmeal, some fruit, maybe even pancakes. I must've came on an off day. Highlights: The meat section was really good. There was a lot of dessert and pastry offerings too. They were serving oxtail pho that day and the broth was actually very tasty. I wouldn't say I'd never come here again, but I'd like to see a bit more refinement and more choices when it comes to a Las Vegas buffet. For now, it's a solid 3.5 Stars."}, {"review_id": "1KGYocAlifeF3N_YPTmizA", "user_id": "I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Did take out from Wicked Spoon and went through the VIP line bought since why not staying with the hotel.

There is one other buffet on the strip that I return to time and time again because it A-MAZING! But, we decided to give wicked spoon a go since we've heard great things. Thoughts:Customer Service: Superb. Cashiers and hostess were courteous and our waitress was beyond excellent and so friendly! Food: I thought there would be more. More variety and overall selection. I noticed that a lot of items were not replenished quickly and sat empty which was not great since the lines happened to be extremely long when we went. Favorites were the prime rib, chicken wings, vegetable gyoza, chicken chow mein and garlic pita with hummus. I also noticed that a lot of the serving tongs were kind of gross which lead me to believe they weren't replaced often... and some stations didn't even have tongs for every item. Cross contamination between foods makes me sad. But, overall, I was very full and happy after clearing 3... okay, 4- plates of food.Dessert: (Because YES, it needs to be rated separately.) I took one of basically everything. Gelato was good. Loved the tres leches cake. I really wish they'd had more variety when it came to macaroons as they only had two options. Overall, it was a good experience. Nothing to write home about, but nothing really to complain about and be upset with.

Although it was significantly better this time, I still was not extremely impressed. My main issue is just that many of the dishes are too salty for my own preference, particularly the pasta. I think the best thing there would have to be the crab legs. I like how there's a lot of meat on every piece so you don't have to spend a lot of time digging through the pile.My bf had to keep reminding me that this is a buffet, so I have to expect buffet quality food. As I'd read in another review, \"This is a good buffet. Some stuff is amazing, some stuff is terrible.\" I completely agree with this statement and believe that Wicked Spoon is above average in terms of buffet food. However, if I had a choice, I'd much rather go to a steakhouse or something where I'd be spending the same amount of money for much better quality food.With that being said, there are a lot of things about Wicked Spoon that I do enjoy. The ambiance is quite nice and they keep the place very clean and presentable. Also, the staff is great at getting the line moving along quickly, so even if it looks like there's a lot of people, the wait usually isn't too bad. They're super friendly and make sure to come check up on you, which isn't something I've experienced at any other buffet. My bf got the $17 bottomless beverages and the waitress even let us take a moscow mule to-go so that was super nice of her. I think my experiences at Wicked Spoon have made me realize that buffets just aren't for me. I've never really liked them before but of course when visiting Vegas, that's all people really talk about so I had to go see what it was about. The standard and quality of Wicked Spoon is better than any other buffet I have been to for sure and I would recommend it to anyone looking for good buffet food, but it's just not my first choice when it comes to food."}, {"review_id": "SCnsrB44b6FK7UDA_1AAXQ", "user_id": "0zDHiDbj79uBOy3OAcE25A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Ambiance 4/5: moderate waiting time, spacious dining area, however the food tray got empty often and not always full filled fastService 3/5: very friendly but kinda slow, had to ask a few times to get drinkFood & Drink 2/5: very disappointing, the food quality dropped dramatically compared to few years ago  Salad - *** average taste  Meat - *** beef, sausage and other red meat  Sushi - * poor quality   Seafood - ** very salty crab legs  Juice - *** freshly made    Desserts - **** the only reason I came here Price 2/5: this place used to have much better food, but nowadays totally not worth the $40+ price"}, {"review_id": "sPlv5_arw-eBCX8-RRW6lA", "user_id": "3nFaqQGUO-7EEg_chrS37Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Last time I was in Vegas, I went to Bacchanal Buffet and had to wait in line for about 30 minutes. I was surprised when we got to Wicked Spoon and there were rows and rows of empty tables. Surprisingly, it still took us 10 minutes to get seated because we weren't allowed to sit down on our own but had to wait for a host to seat us (who subsequently never came back or did anything else?). At first glance, the food selection looks vast - you walk by the mounds of food sporting seafood (crab legs!), a scampi station where you can stirfry fresh fish and shellfish, a meat station with a carver serving up prime rib and roasted chicken, an Asian station with Korean short rib and even a pho bar, and...oh wait, that's basically it, aside from a salad/cold food bar and desserts. Although bigger than most buffets in the US, it lacks diversity for a buffet in Las Vegas. The quality of the food was okay - I enjoyed the scampi station, the crab legs were cooked well, bone marrow was rich as you would expect, but nothing really stood out. The fried chicken was bland, the roasted chicken was surprisingly spicy in a very-hot-but-not-contributing-any-flavor kind of way, the prime rib tasted like nothing, and the pancetta didn't render enough fat off and was too rich. Usually at buffets I'll go back for like 10 plates of the same thing and eat till I'm disgustingly full, but I tapped out after 3 plates because my palate was just bored. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I couldn't help but feel like I could've spent my money eating something infinitely more satisfying.

My personal advice is to not fill up on the desserts. In my opinion their desserts were actually their weakest point, even if they were pretty. The gelato was forgettable, the pastries just so-so.
