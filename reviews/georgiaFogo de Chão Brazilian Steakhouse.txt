We were asked to wait at the bar until most of the party arrived, which is reasonable. This was my first time here, I've tried Chama Gaucha a few times so I knew what to expect. The salad bar was well stocked and offered great choices, I really enjoyed the quinoa salad..VERY FRESH! The meat choices were amazing and I was in love with the sirloin and lamb. Also the cutters remembered each persons requested temperature, which I though was pretty impressive. From reading recent reviews the service seemed like it would be mediocre, but it was awesome and I will be dining here again soon."}, {"review_id": "vdZ9JgxxtLlJhQG9oYCU-w", "user_id": "7wwKmA5Dv8mUd-TmXPOG1w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "I thought I'd give this place a try on my birthday but my experience went horrible. With reservation, we still had to wait for quite a bit. It was a busy night because they had a few large parties. We were being seated at the corner further away from the food and surrounded by loud parties. Very terrible dining environment. Food services were alright - they kept trying to serve us lower quality meat so I had to specifically request for what I want. But it took forever to come... Filet mignon was overcooked. Lamb had a smell. Rib eye was fine. Sirloin was pretty dry. I also thought the buffet table selection was fairly limited. Mostly fruits and veggies. I did like the asparagus though. Very fresh. My companion really liked the pomegranate. They did give me a complimentary dessert but I had to ask for it... (since there was a table right next to us celebrating and was given the dessert, my companion wanted me to ask). I honestly would expect them to bring this up themselves since they clearly knew that I was there for a birthday celebration. The papaya cream with vanilla was pretty good though.What was the most unpleasant about this trip was I noticed that I was billed for something that I never signed for which was nearly two times of what I had agreed to pay!!!???? The waiter shouldn't be making this kind of mistake and I am highly doubtful this was intentional since we had being talking in the end. Ironically, we talked the most when I was about to make the payment. I still don't my money back at this time. Going through this hassle just completed ruined my day and experience. Let's see if Fogo fixes their mistake..... I am NOT planning on returning at this time and won't recommend this place for special occasions. I should have chosen Bones instead."}, {"review_id": "d-IZH6oTKP4ABlUVq-srtQ", "user_id": "VaAChwa-Po4lP_NvdvXVjg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "8:30 PM Reservations really means 9:30 PM or later.

It went this past Saturday which proved to be a very busy evening considering we're in the holiday season of guest having holiday dinner parties. I'm glad we had reservations that seems to be the best option to take regardless of the \"time of year\" The service: Attentive, accommodating and suggestive which I was appreciative of Chris was EXCELLENT, he recommend a beverage from the bar the Passionate it was EVERYTHING.. vodka base muddled with fresh lime and a pinch of sugar... yum! Now because the crowd was heavy the first round of meats that were coming out weren't the best there were a few meats that were on the tough side, but once the atmosphere thinner out most  everything was super tender and DELISH! The meat selection is that if steak, chicken, lamb, and pork it literally is needless until you turn the card in the table from green to RED! The salad bar has a nice selection make sure you try the bacon ... to my Understanding it's always a lil different! For desert I had their chocolate cake ... it's not overly sweet but very heavy a bite or two was enough for me ..

It helps that we did not have lunch.. actually, the fact that we were both starving definitely sealed the deal with the whole AYCE concept of Fogo. I definitely snapchatted some little piggy emojis to some friends that night.. no shame at our table!Though it does not sound like it (oink!), my husband is actually on a pretty strict diet of mainly whole foods (without additives, etc). The salad bar here is a dream when it comes to options for him/us, and you cannot go wrong with simply grilled meats. I personally really liked the kale salad, fresh citrus fruits, the imported parma ham, fresh mozzarella balls and the grilled veggies. Some sides are served tableside; mashed potatoes, fried plantains and these weird gummy like cheese bread things.. I'm not a fan of those, but the plantains are bomb.My favorites were the picanha (coulotte cut), ribeye, and little racks of lamb (lollipops). After a few go arounds the waiters will remember your preferred done-ness, and once they caught on they immediately started cutting off the best looking med-rare pieces. The service here is definitely very attentive!"}, {"review_id": "ufdrOmwqCZ2xu2vrJJ8ixw", "user_id": "2Ai5yFKhsOuNr4pNEb5-Lg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "We were here for one of my friends' birthday and I have to say, I enjoyed it.

What can I say, we are steak lovers lol. I typically eat a trio of 3 of the several choices, my favorites being Picanha, Filet Mignon (duh), & the beef short ribs. They are all SO good in their own different ways. Picanha has the most flavor, obviously salty because you're eating at a brazilian steakhouse! Filet most tender and amazing, and the beef ribs pack a lot of that juicy fatty flavor! The ribs are so good and super tender, like beef cheek! I got a non-alcoholic beverage, the \"Andean Punch\", basically a virgin mojito with guava and strawberries I think? It was DELICIOUS, a little too sweet so just added some water to it, still was really good! The pao de quiejo is always so good and fresh there. Mashed potatoes are KILLER. Plantains also amazing and sweet. Strawberry cheesecake= heavenly. The little salad and cheese buffet also has some cool things, they had a spring pea salad which was really good!

This has consistently been my favorite restaurant in Atlanta. It's not just the quantity, but the quality. Fogo is one of the top grossing restaurants in the Southeast, and therefore all of the suppliers literally beg Fogo to use their products.  Many of the high ups at this restaurant came from Brazil when the restaurant came to Atlanta some 16 years ago.  They are all super nice and friendly!!  As an all you can eat meat extravaganza with servers that come by and carve these succulent  meats table side, this place is truly heaven on earth for the carnivore in you.  Each person is given a card with red on one side and green on the other.  When you turn your card over to green, the servers will come and bring you any kind of meat at the temperature that you desire.  Please note that you can ask the servers for any specific kind of meat at any temperature. Do not simply wait for the servers to bring you a particular cut of meat.  Be proactive and ask them to bring you the the specific cut of meat that you desire.  If you wish to have this meat continuously brought to you, tell them to keep bringing it to you!!  Otherwise you might wind up waiting a long time for a specific cut of meat!  Don't make a huge rookie mistake!!!!  Remember, you control the pace of your meal and which foods you would like to eat.  If you get a salad upfront, you can eat it alongside the meat instead of eating the entire salad before the meat.  This is huge rookie mistake that I see all too often.  There is no rule that says you must eat a salad before you begin eating the meat!!  In fact, in Europe they eat the salads at the end of the meal!  I personally recommend turning your card over immediately and going straight for the meat rather than filling up on salad.  I usually get the salad later in the meal or even at the end of the meal.  But again, if you do opt for a salad, push it to the side as a \"side salad\" and eat it with the meal as opposed to filling up on a salad appetizer.  One of the interesting items you usually have to ask for by name is the juicy and flavorful lemon pepper chicken breast.  It's delicious!Note that the delicious house made cheese bread is gluten free!!!  It's made with yuca flour rather than wheat.  The restaurant was renovated last year and sports a completely new look along with an open kitchen.  It's perfect for a special occasion, romantic dinner, or anytime you want a great meal with some serious meat!There is a decent sized seating area in the back of the restaurant that is less crowded.  You might want to eat here if you want a little more privacy.  In addition to a large private room in the back for groups, they have added a new room that is behind a glass wall.  This new room is for smaller gatherings up to 15 or 20 people.   The desserts are delectable.  If you still have room, the cheese cake and flan are phenomenal.  The papa cream is vanilla ice cream with pineapple juice.  Make sure they pour the special liquor over it to really make it pop!  They also have tiramisu and several other favorites.  I'm already having withdrawal cravings and will have to go back sooooooon!!!!"}, {"review_id": "Cj_gHrXGSFjW0HKVmhjkEg", "user_id": "gmFGonfH6VYYza4CQQ_ohA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "The food, noise level and VIP treatment from the wait staff; all make this one if the best Brazilian steakhouses in Atlanta!
