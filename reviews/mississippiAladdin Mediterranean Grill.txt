That fried goat cheese is AMAZING! The spinach pie is phenomenal. Pitas are fresh and handmade. Great! Both the wheat and the white! Lamb shank stew was not gamey at all. Flavors of cinnamon are prominent. Service was great. Wanted to try the baklava but it never made it to the table."}, {"review_id": "dQFuASm9iJaZpZwosvrgfA", "user_id": "0wzO086qRxBYSapHjZ2uvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Gyro plate never disappoints !

All members of family enjoyed their meal. 1. Food: Everything was tasty and neatly presented.I tried Tabouli, it was 'ok to good', but the main courses and deserts were a higher quality.  We tried a Gyro plate and a 'combo' with chicken and meat. Both were very enjoyable.  My wife tried baklava .. and gave it a good review.2. Service.. friendly and professional.3. Location: Nice interior, the front may not give that impression !  FYI.. it's byob."}, {"review_id": "dGPInUwrAwrVl9XwGUSjIQ", "user_id": "T68PUOXE8kzjsDQbOYjjbg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Came by tonight with my girlfriends, we sat in a \"green room\" type room. Super cute and cozy! We all ordered different things. I got the chicken shawarma plate, chicken was moist and delicious. My girlfriends ordered the hummus appetizer and gyro plate. I liked her gyro plate more than mine. The thick cut of gyro meat didn't have a strong smell of lamb at all...and it being a thicker cut, I think it helped sealed in the flavor and juices which kept it moist. Often times I find gyro meat to be a tad dry from being cut too thin and with lamb being such a lean meat, it's hard to make keep lamb moist.The hummus in my opinion is a tad too loose, more like a dip than spread. I prefer my hummus thicker. The bread was a tad thin and was stuck together, I like my bread thicker and softer also.Service was good and food came out fairly quick. I wanted to try the spinach spanakopita, I asked our waitress if she knew the difference between that and the baklava, other than one is savory and one is a sweet dessert. It looked like the same flaky outside dough, she didn't know the difference, so I didn't want to try it. I like the flaky dough of the baklava, thought it was the savory version of it.I paid with cash, I was supposed to get a few dollars back and I think 40 cents. They didn't bother to give me the 40 cents in change. I usually tip 50% of my bill if I received amazing service, so it's not like you're not going to get that change back. It's the principal of giving people their right change back and not assume that it's yours. I still tipped 20% including the change."}, {"review_id": "83oGppffIchxW4yMaab4Dg", "user_id": "ehE9x-K0MOBu615C1pR1AQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2017", "text": "Looked forward to the lamb chops.

But, Aladdin has always held its own in the taste of Mediterranean. It has been a staple that has lasted for as long as I can remember.

Parking is terrible but they're friendly inside, good selection of options. Very affordable and generous is the meat portions. Recommended subbing sauteed veggies in for salad, $2 well worth it.
