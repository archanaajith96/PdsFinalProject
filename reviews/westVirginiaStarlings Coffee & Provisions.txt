I knew that there had to be one, somewhere and wondrously I found this great little local treasure. I grew up on the East End of Charleston and now I work near by, so I plan on becoming a regular at this awesome eatery.Just a little about the décor, outside municipal parking lot with meters, so .25 is nothing. The outside seating terrace is lovely with the white/clear hanging lights, I can only imagine how peaceful it can be in warmer climate or season. The inside is bright, airy and so open. Large windows, great color scheme and such a warm feeling. Free WiFi is a plus but I guess you have to ask for the code if you are dining in. I told the lady at the counter that this was my first visit and she recommended their fresh homemade breakfast sandwiches but I wanted a homemade bagel. She went on to give me a list of Organic Homemade varieties that they had to offer me. I went with the Onion Bagel to go, because I was on my way to the office. She handed me a great looking bagel with purple onion flowery design on top of the bagel, cooked to perfection. The presentation on a lovely bright teal blue ceramic plate with silver spreading utensil with a wooden handle. She pointed out the toaster where I could toast my bagel before leaving. I also was given some regular unflavored cream cheese, not sure if homemade but it was good. While toasting my bagel to go, I noticed some items in the dairy case and decided to take a container of soup with me to work for lunch. Altogether, it was $10 for both my breakfast and lunch including taxes and tip. Not bad, cheaper than Nashville for sure!!! When I got to the office I enjoyed my bagel, and it was so delicious! I definitely and highly recommend, and I can't wait to get another one!!! While there, a regular named Jack gave the highest praise on their homemade Lemon Bars, went as far as to offer to buy me one. I turned him down, and thanked him of course, and later thought to myself...\"Who in their right mind, turns down FREE Pastries????\"....apparently ME!!! Call me stupid Jack!!! At lunch, I heated up my soup...Vegan Veggie Mediterranean Soup. Everyone in the kitchen at work was commenting on how it smelled so great and wanted to know where I purchased it. I gladly told them Starlings on East Washington Street. The soup was a glorious blend of spices, onions, bits of tomatoes, spicy peppers, and I believe chunks of pumpkin, it could have been sweet potatoes but I am going to say pumpkin. It was aromatically enticing as well, my only concern but not a deal breaker, there was a little too much turmeric in the broth because I was turning every thing yellow. I was afraid my teeth would have a yellow tint before I could get to the restroom for any hygiene relief...But I would definitely, I swear definitely eat here again and again. This is a great place and please don't let the location hinder you. Its all good!!!! Go give them a try, dine in or carry out either way you won't be disappointed!!!!!"}, {"review_id": "PX8aLtfGz5Ful2kFJHHrnQ", "user_id": "GYcoX9XUMe90qfD0MiL9Kg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Coffee was bad. No menu to even have an idea on what drinks or food were even offered.  Display case was empty other than what looked like wax paper wrapped things. Counter was dirty and whole back working area of staff looked unorganized furthering the avalanche of disappointment and concern of cleanliness.  Had high hopes for this place and were severely disappointed.Only reason they aren't getting one star is the guy working was nice and parking was super easy. Hopefully this was a just a really bad day for them or maybe it's changed owners."}, {"review_id": "QwgQUN4WuD0-GfIig8if_Q", "user_id": "UC_yxFSY0ooblOd6c4hcjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "This is the ideal place if you're looking for a weekend breakfast, brunch, juice or a vegan treat! I stopped here on my way through town for brunch and had iced coffee, the strawberry oat bar, and asparagus blue onion quiche. The decor and space remind me of my favorite local coffee shop and the service is personable. They have some outdoor patio seating and a view of the mountains. I highly recommend trying their rotating omelets and anything they recommend. On my way out they even topped off my iced coffee."}, {"review_id": "wtGiCfMSRVognCyeCeV6PA", "user_id": "LODtI9h56vAdkN1mrPDvWg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2017", "text": "Since coming to Charleston,  West Virginia this has been a regular breakfast stop for me.

A wonderful surprise. Nice atmosphere, inside and out. Our family of six sat at the large table inside and ordered two omelettes, an egg sandwich on bagel, a plain bagel with cream cheese, a couple of muffins and coffee. The omelettes were fantastic! One was bacon and cheese the other feta cheese and spinach. The egg sandwich was excellent. Only negative observation; no menu! They had a black board but nothing written. Odd! Found out about specials from the server at counter. Highly recommended though.
