Since we discovered the Saturday flat iron steak special, it has been our weekend date spot. 8oz steak, mashed potatoes and onion rings for $8? Yes please! ($13 to add on mushrooms, onions and shrimp...worth it!)The interior of the restaurant is so unique. Cozy cafe vibe with a full bar. The staff is always SO friendly and attentive. And they got us drinks on the house for my boyfriends birthday - I like that! Appetizers are pretty good as well. I love the stuffed mushroom caps and the wild mushroom brie soup is a MUST. Can't wait to go back next March 10 2018 - I'm so sad because the food and service used to be exceptional. But after 5 times, maybe the first few times were a fluke. So disappointed. Down stars."}, {"review_id": "FMuZgPIYMQdLilrRqq-rkQ", "user_id": "_c1dx5zPEiHFxnW6nVeATQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "Really love the individual quiches on the brunch menu.

We were greeted at the door and seated right away. Waitress brought water while we were looking at the drink menu. Nice bottled beer selection. Food menu was about perfect size. There was a burger on the menu where they use grilled cheese sandwiches for buns. Wowza! I went with one of the express lunch specials: mac and cheese with turkey and bacon. It was amazing! Great bread crumb topping. Came with a tasty dinner roll. Hubby went with the Italian chicken sammy. He said it was great and the chicken breast was cooked perfect. Overall: great atmosphere, great service, great food. Will definitely recommend to friends."}, {"review_id": "GEC9HAedycvS8JCDAqFZzw", "user_id": "1W1DwgLQKNdDFTepnbnKfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "This is my go to breakfast place.

We had a reservation. My meal was pretty good, as were many others. The menu is limited: they have more alcoholic beverages than entrees. One would think that a menu of 12-15 items would make things faster Service was atrocious. We waited an hour for our food. Six were drinking coffee and every creamer on the table was expired, which was discovered after some had already consumed it. It clotted in a cup of coffee which prompted examining expiration dates, some of which were nearly a month past. One in our party ordered a Rambo burger and it was so raw the waitress gaped when he showed her. My husband ordered a side of sausage with his French toast. It didn't come with the entree. Over the course of eating he requested the side 3 times. Everyone's plates were cleared when it finally arrived. Needless to say he turned it down. The waitress came back infrequently prior to the food being served, probably because it was very busy. She did the best she could and we saw at least 2 other waitresses as well. When the bill we we're comped for the sausage and all the coffees because of the creamer issue. This place is very poorly managed and they were understaffed. Will not return."}, {"review_id": "4MMLy-UK88P5SwNSVCvPpQ", "user_id": "fQN3ZIadnQ8H9MNyR5YPGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "My husband and I went on a double date with our friends on a Sunday afternoon. If you haven't been here, they serve brunch all Saturday and Sundays. It was packed when we went but luckily, we were seated a few minutes after our arrival. I ordered a meat quiche, which I'd give a 3 out of 5 because the little hash browns are what stole the show for me. My husband enjoyed his burger. I love that they had board games, we played a game of Sequences before our food arrived. Overall, we enjoyed our brunch and will return again."}, {"review_id": "rtq-he5FiRG0pZzDUbAlnw", "user_id": "qKqjCBIMAYBAxg3ZgfJloA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/21/2017", "text": "I have no idea why I haven't been here much sooner, but I'm definitely glad I found it! First off, the atmosphere in this place is just cool. It's hippy and artsy and definitely a great addition downtown. The service was excellent. The drinks unique and definitely made with high quality, fresh ingredients. I had some sort of lemonade vodka drink that was on special with strawberry purée and a mint leaf. It was delicious. But the FOOD, out of this world. I couldn't decide so I asked our server her recommendation. She was pretty keen on the cheeseburger served between not one, but two Texas toast grilled cheese sandwiches. I added fried onions and mushrooms and it was hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had, if not the best. Looking forward to many more visits here."}, {"review_id": "dN8044aUwr0eMV08163ZcQ", "user_id": "dej5guoQ4PFkzXjpTSGMhA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "First time here.

Way more chewy than crunchy.The good:  Nice and pleasant staff.  Fries were quite tasty.   I would not recommend the big cat burger even though it is kind of what they are known for.  (or any other burger for that matter)I will go back to try the fish fry and brunch, but it will be a while before I try regular lunch or dinner."}, {"review_id": "4oVZf1RK0Feyg2ILtGXyqA", "user_id": "8BUCAQEUXNOX7kP6lcUpBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "I have been coming here since they opened and ultimately never been disappointed.  Today I went to Sunday brunch for the first time and oh my GOD it was good!  On the recommendation of a friend I had the eggs Benedict made with chorizo.  It was fantastic.  Wait staff was attentive and pleasant despite being very busy.  The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is that prices have gone up and parking is inadequate."}, {"review_id": "5678-rr3iSI6_WObS0KYVA", "user_id": "hB2o9LSVn5IvoVNfup82yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "YES!!!  YES!!!  YES!!!  You should stop here and have a meal.  Great decor, friendly staff, good food, and it will draw you back for another visit.  Very clean, knowledgeable staff!  Parking is a pain and you have to walk a bit to the place, not handicap friendly obviously.  First visit was perfect, but second visit, a little issue with cooking the way we asked.  They did take our complaint and redid it and more.  I highly recommend them."}, {"review_id": "3JeTsER5oJPxiKmIGYtBTg", "user_id": "oViqEqzfvZgvNZqNrvSK-g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/24/2016", "text": "We have been in a few times over the past few years and have always had really good service and good food.  We do love the atmosphere of the place which has a, surprisingly, good bar area with a good Bloody Mary.   They serve a good brunch on Sunday's but be prepared for a wait or have reservations.  They do some great, and inexpensive, specials each day of the week which helps keep the menu fresh and new. Good gyro plate, Greek salad, French onion soup and the absolutely best steak you can get in Green Bay for $12!  Honestly, the flat iron steak for $12 may be the best value dish out of any restaurant in Green Bay - it's a tender 8oz charcoal grilled steak that would be a good dish for $20 let alone $12 (or cheaper on special).  It's worth coming here just for this dish alone."}, {"review_id": "M5YpSOJQbe-bfsl0bkmOhw", "user_id": "4M4cSeOhR7ZYod33gu47gA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "First time going and it was during lunch time.
