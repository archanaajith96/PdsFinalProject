At first, I never really cared for curry or spices or anything spicy. As I grew older, I discovered this awesome love for spicy foods and curry and guess what?! Indian food has those two, such a wonderful combination! ANYWAY, hands down the best Indian restaurant in the 757. Tops Saffron and any other Indian restaurant in the area. Everything is made to order meaning that everything is fresh and made how you requested it. For Indian cuisine, that's usually the best way to have your dish made. You can choose how spicy you want your food and what sauces you'd like to have in your dish which calls for an appetizing meal! The décor is absolutely stunning. I felt like I was in a high class restaurant in India, it was gorgeous. It was a lovely mixture of grey and blue tones that made me feel relaxed and comfortable as I was enjoying my food. It was pretty crowded for lunch time, but the atmosphere was grand! Our waiter was very informative about their entrees and the background of the restaurant. So, like I said earlier I was there during their lunch hours, they have an express lunch menu, you choose one item from the first course and one item from their main course. Depending on what protein you ask for is how much your lunch will be. The most your lunch would be is $12 with a choice of protein. This restaurant is as authentic as you're going to get for delicious Indian cuisine."}, {"review_id": "-E3I5UFq6BDmMKNX93HGxg", "user_id": "gAaohc11Ylak0Zf-gsdK4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Just was driving by and decided to give it a try...

Service was excellent.   Price... exceptionally reasonableCrowd... only about half full on a sunny Sunday at 1 pmWe're absolutely trying this one again and adding it to the favorites list.."}, {"review_id": "B2m9d4tpvJogAa0uYzz00w", "user_id": "aW4f6gBmelaZxcVFgbfNFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Definitely my favorite place in Hampton Roads!!!  My husband and I eat here once a week!

The dipping sauce they serve with the samosas is so flavorful! And the chaat was so delicious I wanted to lick the plate! Even the plain side salad was so perfectly seasoned. My kids love the Chana masala. My husband and I have both tried the chicken korma and the chicken patia.

The service is prompt, food comes quickly, and the staff is nice.  Ambience is comfortable (dim lights and quieter with music).   The younger waiter is pretty good with his gestures in explaining the tastes of each dish.  This restaurant can get busy but it is rarely completely full.The flavors are vivid and bright.  One particular aspect I admire about this restaurant is its interest in establishing individuality against the usual North Indian grain with respect to its menu.  To elaborate, there are certain dishes I have heard of.  There are modifications away from the usual Chicken Tikka or Saag Paneer (even though they have both dishes).  There is a chaat of the day.  There are tandoor dishes.  There are curries and a variety of breads.  I highly suggest trying a variety of the dishes.  I was a bit underwhelmed by the vegetables dan-a-dan.  It didn't strike me with the same amount of umami I receive with most other dishes.  The gobi manchurian is pretty spicy.  I wish it was double fried for a bit more of crunch.   I highly suggest visiting this restaurant.  It has a lot of character in its menu.  I can't wait to try more."}, {"review_id": "lJqcMFMyzaYdMe_oncyDQg", "user_id": "7UTEdK2Cl2OoZnghgRz2KA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Delish Indian food.
