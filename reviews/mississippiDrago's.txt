We were seated immediately upon arrival. Our waiter was very nice and checked on us multiple times throughout our meal. For an appetizer we went with the lobster Mac and cheese as well as a half dozen of their charbroiled oysters. The oysters were fantastic and may have been the best that I have ever had. They gave me French bread instead of crackers for it. The lobster Mac and cheese was amazing! Great flavor and nice portion. The pasta had a very generous portion of lobster in it. We got the short rib and shrimp and grits for our entrees. The rib was very tender and well flavored. The shrimp and grits had an nice cajun flavor and was full of shrimp. We had so much food that we had to bring half of the entrees home. I'll definitely be back at Drago's when I'm near one in the future."}, {"review_id": "8tjyXth99i2kOcXjb7DlwA", "user_id": "t87ARQ7Ler1Bx9VnCndXjg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This review is regarding the service of this restaurant, not the food. This review is long but i felt I needed thoroughly explain my 1 star rating. I have never felt so unwelcome at a restaurant before from the time we walked in until we left the service was awful. It was our first time there, we walked in without any greeting by the hostess, only a blank stare to which I said two people.. we were seated shortly after with silverware and two serving plates which had crumbs on both. (I know, why did we stay?) our server finally took our drink order and had terrible etiquette. Not friendly at all, talking to another waiter as she passed by, etc. At the end of the meal we asked for the check and he replied with a twirling hand motion that he had a lot of tables, and rolled his eyes!! I couldn't believe it. It was 4pm at this time, the restaurant had very little costumers. Once he brought the check he then told us that he wasn't even supposed to serve us, that he only took us because no one else did, and we were just standing there. He then added our table wasn't even in his section!!!! I was appalled. Needless to say, it was a terrible experience, we will never go back and to think I went there for my birthday."}, {"review_id": "SLUF0EJIg3vfhCJiWAq5wQ", "user_id": "OoGzz5hV54aeuTi1g_YLPg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "First time eating at Drago's on Friday, January 5th.  Must begin by saying that I was pleasantly surprised....a nice decor and atmosphere inside this restaurant.  I ordered the lunch shrimp platter and my family ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and the fried alligator po boy sandwich.  Both enjoyed their sandwiches and I enjoyed my shrimp platter.The one downside was that my side dishes were very small.....a few bites and I was finished.Reasonable prices at $50+ for 3 meals with soft drinks.  Normally when we visit Mississippi and eat in a restaurant it is very disappointing but definitely will return the next time that we visit Mississippi and try some other things on the menu."}, {"review_id": "agJ9ICwRMlGAnlnTjVEDlQ", "user_id": "kKTcYPz47sCDH1_ylnE4ZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "We ordered room service delivery from Drago's when we were staying at the Hilton in Jackson, Mississippi on our southern road trip in January 2017.  It was convenient that they delivered right to our room and that it was room service style, even though they're a separate restaurant down the street from the hotel. The food was good, but not blow-me-away good.  I did like it, but it wasn't exactly the best meal I had on our southern road trip. I ordered the following: -Fried Catfish (this was my first time having catfish and it was tasty, but the fact that I could still see the outline of the fish weirded me out...)-Corn Maque Choux (this was good, though a bit too sweet for my liking)Overall, good food.  Just not the best, and I'd probably try something different if I visit Jackson, MS in the future.  However, it was still a nice meal and I really appreciated that we got it as room service."}, {"review_id": "r8TM1YOGce03fnZ8eCCqiA", "user_id": "NZpjvCp6L8EJ0OozROd5fA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "This review is based upon personal and geographical taste. Drago's atmosphere was upbeat and inviting.  Our waitress was very friendly and serving. Our food? As I stated, based upon personal and geographical taste my wife and I did not like our main dishes.  I did order the chargrilled oysters.  I enjoyed them. Even got a small pearl from one, but nowhere near the quality of Acme in New Orleans.  My wife's gumbo was extremely thick. More like an étouffée. I had the Duck dish with oysters and pasta.  Hmmm, the duck was good but the oysters and pasta? Not to my liking.  Tasted like they shucked the oysters and just dumped the salty un-rinsed oysters and salty juice in the pasta.  Just not to my liking.  My wife's grilled shrimp and angel hair pasta was ok. She didn't enjoy it.  Again, I think that our geographical taste buds may have gotten the best of us.  Most reviews love this place.  Based upon my taste and our fantastic service the best I can give it is three stars."}, {"review_id": "Z3DD_oUqCzaqNAjd3A3Q1A", "user_id": "0mbpZKwbdZTM0rhehWUodg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Place is nice, staff very friendly.

They serve cajun cuisine but I always get the same thing whenever I go - a dozen charbroiled oysters and a lemon drop martini. Every time I get them they never disappoint. The oysters always come out hot and sizzling fresh off the grill and my martini is always just right.  I usually sit in the bar area and receive great service.  Sometimes there is live music while you're dining. Hands down,  one of my favorite spots in Jackson!"}, {"review_id": "OWR-rCJeNSd8pw83xdKUfQ", "user_id": "xQ72nFYFH88I3S4_usobcA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Overpriced for over buttered+season food. Ya I know I should have known better as I have been to another location in Nola. We wanted to come here because it was walking distance from our hotel the Hilton. We started with the raw oysters, I do have to give them thumbs up on them! Then for my entree I ordered the tuna steak with asparagus. At no where on the menu did it say the tuna had some kind of butter sauce on it!  I had to swipe my fork left to right to get the sauce off, I wish they updated the menu to include if the dishes are topped with any kind of sauce or aoli, my asparagus were also way over seasoned with Cajun spice that probably has msg in the ingredients. What killed the vibe was their cost of wine, ridiculous pricing for low cost wine. Over $34 for dark horse which runs you less than $10 in a wine shop. And they wanted $150 for Jordan which runs $50-$60 usually. This place is definitely overpriced and not worth it."}, {"review_id": "LP-tO3KH7oTExRcsbhVSAw", "user_id": "0rg_a7WhR2swv3r0msam4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "The absolute best place to go for creole food.

I ordered a Cajun spiced white fish, which had potatoes and spinach on the side. The fish was good, but the sides needed a little seasoning on them.

Drago's served that purpose in spades. The service was superb. Ask for Taylor. He was the epitome of what you want in a server. Knowledgeable, kind and in-obtrusive. We also met Kristina, a manager, who was also very warm and considerate. Plus the food was great. Oysters were $.75 apiece during happy hour and were fresh and delicious. We both had redfish which was the catch of the day and was super.
