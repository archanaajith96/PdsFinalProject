These are some of the most knowledgeable bartenders I've come across in the area. There are no menus at all, so you get to tell them exactly what you want in your cocktail. I can't express enough how fun this place is! Tiki style drinks, depression era cocktails, boozy milkshakes, and so much more. You will NOT be disappointed in coming here for a cocktail. We visited on a Friday night at 830 and there was still room and not much of a wait. Parking on the street is easy.  If you love this place as much as I did, you'll end up going two nights in a row and telling all of your friends about it in the meantime. Can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "eTCWi80wu-tcPaScqc7iuA", "user_id": "z-ac4aPTz64j2ehH7qfqcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "I love places like this. Its got that speakeasy vibe, and the cocktails are super special. Saw this place on \"Best Bars in America\" so they hype was pretty high. Its located on the outskirts of town, looks like diner/pool hall from outside. Inside its dim, and pretty lively. Theres no drink menu, they make whatever you want which is cool. We literally told our server what we like, and they whipped up something back there. I give this place credit for being unique, and in a town like Milwaukee it deff stands out. But I'm not going the lie my cocktails were alright. My thoughts might be biased living in Chicago where the cocktails are better. Although this place does have alot of charm, and is a switch of place compared to most Milwaukee bars."}, {"review_id": "j9N9FLXMqVMxLTbk1wMvFw", "user_id": "a1jaqBDi3A71yS8fA6ckYA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "Pretty one of the most unique lounge I've been to.

Be warned... on weekends you'll probably have to wait for a table, especially with larger groups!  With it's intimate feel, I would suggest to come with groups of 4 of less for the best experience.At Bryant's they don't give out menus, but rather they ask you your preference on flavor notes and alcohol.  They usually come up with some great selections, which is wonderful for people who want to explore the wide world of cocktails.I would definitely arrive with your whole group, since they aren't great at accommodating additions to parties that have already been seated."}, {"review_id": "ZD-jRyBB5k-t_ExoLuHKBw", "user_id": "79PMejA4-xLHlYWPIxAZfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2017", "text": "Only the most unique Cocktail Lounge in Milwaukee!It follows the speakeasy theme so you wouldn't know that it's a proper bar inside (looks like a house from the outside)! We absolutely love coming to Bryant's! The unique thing about them is that they don't have any menu so you can describe to them what kind of cocktail you would like and the servers make recommendations based on that and bring you an unique and super delicious drink! The servers are super knowledgeable and they always have provided great recommendations to us. I do note down the drinks I like so that next time it's easier for me to give them a name. They are also known for their ice cream cocktails. I personally haven't tried these but I have seen a lot of people around me order them! They are popular!

There is not a food menu - Just drinks baby2.) It is dark in Bryant's- Think Madmen cocktail lounge3.) It gets crowded after 8:00 so if you for sure want a table I would get there by 7:30 4.) There isn't a drink menu; you tell your server what flavors you like and they make suggestions from their HUGE drink menu5.) We were wearing jeans and fit in just fine, but we also saw people dressed up whatever you have on will be fineWe walked in and we were seated upstairs in the velvet lounge.  Loved having a little table overlooking the neighborhood and yeah I loved the velvet wallpaper....I mean who wouldn't?  Our server came right away and asked us what we liked and didn't like.  She was very knowledgable and asked all of the right questions.  We were served deliciousness very quickly! I had the Bryant's cosmo (in all transparency I had a couple) and it was wonderful! Not sure everything that was in there but it was fun trying to guess.  Hubby sampled a couple different drinks and they were gone quickly so I would say he more than enjoyed them.What we loved best about Bryant's - It is just a cool place to relax and talk.  I loved hearing the old music and feeling like we were in a bygone era.  Bryant's will definitely be on our regular haunts list!"}, {"review_id": "ynxANlBIvkD8HVeBpqXXhg", "user_id": "696zcGY1Kiycwz_GeSaiYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/3/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm not going to waste your time if you're a local. If you live in Milwaukee you know this is the place for an unforgettable  evening.What to expect, you might not be old enough, but think back to the 1970's when you could smoke in public, drink an drive ( Don't try it now!)  and Aqua Net was the must have beauty product for woman.This place is a step back in time. It's so dark, when you walk in you will need a good two minutes for your eyes to adjust. The curvy bar is so sexy. Don't embarrass yourself by asking for a menu, this is only cocktails baby... no menu.The bartender ask what do you like and they make it from one of 300 secret recipes. If you're looking to get in and out, then go somewhere else, scratch made cocktails take time.what you WON'T get here is a homogeneous evening. It will be a night to remember. Imagine a time without the stress of cell phones, the internet or the current political climate.Sit back, relax and enjoy the luxury of a bye gone era.BTW- The Pink Squirrel was invented here. Dude's man up and have at least one, they're delicious.

I was looking forward to visiting one of esquire's best bars of America but our visit was disappointing. My boyfriend and I have been to a number of speakeasies in different cities so we were interested in what Milwaukee had in store. The place definitely specializes in drinks with ice cream and whip cream. Also, I saw a number of drinks that were fluorescent blue or pink in tiki and hurricane glasses. I love the idea of dealers choice and I usually have a good experience. I wanted a gin drink with citrus and slightly sweet. The waitress suggested an aviation which I've had before but I still enjoyed it. I loved the slight floral notes and it's cool that they give you a double of the cocktail once you're finished with your first glass. My boyfriend wasn't so lucky with his choice. He wanted something similar to a bourbon sour and the waitress asked if he wanted a fruity note and he said he liked orange. What he got was an electric blue cocktail which tasted like straight koolaid. He couldn't drink more than 2 sips and when we caught the waitress again, he asked for a negroni. It was sorta frustrating because whenever we ordered a new drink, they would be sent separately so we weren't drinking our drinks at the same time. I asked the waitress if they could make a south side cocktail, and she didn't know what that was. I explained it's just gin, lemon, and mint and she asked if I wanted a gin mojito. My gin mojito was quite watered down and not sweet at all. My boyfriend's negroni also tasted burnt. We didn't get the blue cocktail taken off the bill, when my boyfriend clearly didn't enjoy it, which was also a damper. Overall, this place seems like the bar for someone who prefers their alcoholic drink to be a dessert."}, {"review_id": "2sRteMTckhEPNAkqhget8w", "user_id": "hjwIzYrSysGsBWZjGhcPvQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "I'm sorry not to be able to give a better review.  After hearing lots of raves about Bryant's, I went there with a friend.  The vibe and decor is great- vintage and casual.

Also I was pretty shocked that this cocktail ( bottled lime juice, simple syrup and rum) cost me $11. My friend got some sort of holiday punch that was okay.
