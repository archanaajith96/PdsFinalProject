The aroma of the spices blending together along with cilantro, fresh basil, bean sprouts, and makes an awesome combination of flavors that make a tummy warm. This is a great remedy for cold or a night on the town. They have large and extra large for those who cannot get enough. There are many drinks to choose from. I really like thai iced tea along with pho. It is a good size of restaurant especially if you want to get away from it all. The service was very good, he  was attentive and checked to make sure everything was good. It's a good place to bring a date or famliy. I plan on returning to try more items on the menu. I was happy to finally try this place out.I've been to many places on the west side so far this place takesthe cake for being on this location. I seriously recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "dyg6XK0krG9ilZZeqOYipw", "user_id": "vSh277s8yG1DMb_zo5tNlg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Second time here. The first time here I ordered a strawberry smoothie with boba. The lady took super long to make it because she threw a better tub of boba in the microwave to soften it. I KID YOU NOT, the boba was hard and tasted like throw up. The second time here, I got a glass of Thai tea. They fill the cup up with 75% ice and I took five sips and was done. The springs had two tiny shrimp in each roll and the peanut sauce was a weird texture. Place looks filthy and dirty."}, {"review_id": "Ysj18QLdaE50U-R0rvGozA", "user_id": "zZWxr_Vi8i8jfEQQFz25hA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Have been here so many times since moving closer to Rio rancho from ABQ, finally decided to review.

It quickly became a favorite. Excellent food beautifully prepared. The menus at Saigon and Saigon 2 are almost identical. Vicky was there the night we dropped in for our initial Westside visit. But this time I had to try my favorite pho-pho tai nam, with the tai on a separate plate to be added at the table. This keeps it from being overcooked, and it still retains the texture and taste of very rare beef. This pho is outstanding, and among the very best in the Duke City area. Fragrant, tasty, and beautifully spiced.We tried two appetizers: Pork and shrimp spring rolls (great) and stir-fried mussels with tamarind (#9 on the menu). These guys were plump, tender, and succulent, and the tamarind-based sauce is a welcome addition to the customary white wine and garlic steaming broth that is widespread here. Delicious, and a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.Wash the whole meal down with a glass of fresh lemonade, and ask for it to be not too sweet with some salt added. This salty lemonade has long been my favorite beverage in Vietnamese restaurants since I discovered it thirty years ago. The Vietnamese iced coffee is excellent here, too.*"}, {"review_id": "SfFKTVm6WANIHbKoJp-t2g", "user_id": "chth4GLt1FjZBAJmMUjqOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "Always a great experience for a quick lunch.  The egg rolls are to die for and honestly some of the most flavorful Pho around.  When I worked in Albuquerque I would go to their original restaurant. I lucked out when they put in their second location around the corner from my office.

We had the #11 which is just the basic beef pho and the #27 which is a spicier pho. They were both quick and good. The place seems clean and the service is good.

Tonight, I ordered the tasty Phò Bò, which comes with rice noodles, tender sliced beef steak, beef tendon, and the usual assortment of add-ins, like bean sprouts, cilantro, sliced jalapenos, and Thai basil. I can't recall if there was fresh mint or not, but if not, it wasn't missed. The broth, which was pork-based, was thin but tasty - not too spicy even with the added jalapenos.The best part about Phò is the low price. Our total (two people) was only about $15. Whatadeal.  The ambiance was pleasant, and out waiter was friendly and attentive.  Would I go out of my way to dine here? Probably. It is easy to get Phò, but hard to get really good Phò."}, {"review_id": "Cm02lZZUIKAwl99O4WDkHw", "user_id": "5rSpX6XGbGqMbNfLZAe6Yw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "This is my go to place for pho, specially when I'm sick!

She always seems upset, never smiles and makes you feel like your presence bothers her. She used to be pleasant but all of the sudden she changed her ways...maybe she does not like me...even though I am always polite and a good tipper. But everybody who works there is nice so I will not stop dining there and if it were not for the treatment I get from this server I would have given them 5 stars. Hopefully she or the owner will read this and realize how important a smile is when you are in the restaurant business, I should know since I owned a restaurant for 16 hears."}, {"review_id": "GSC9ahTRYMj1oS1tqT2y9g", "user_id": "MFOiEksYUCgUHRNEjW06Sw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "6/27/2017", "text": "Ordered two fish dishes to go.
