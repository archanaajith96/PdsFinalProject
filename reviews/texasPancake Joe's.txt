It was great little breakfast spot in south side of town. I hadn't been over in that area since my sons beat hell out of the high school there years ago. I don't think they ever have a great team anymore that's a shame great area and great people around there. Joe's has a awesome breakfast and coffe was very good also. Can't say enough it and will change stars when I get back in a week or so and try lunch."}, {"review_id": "JQUvzbhkdB1Dcq4dwuV86Q", "user_id": "CAX0Bc13wcbpRM4lA2NhUw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Wifey and I ventured out of our NSA circle of comfort and and came across this neighborhood restaurant that's tucked away in a shopping mall.  First and foremost, service...excellent.  Their menu has a lot to choose from and our waiter (Jake)explained what was hot and what was not.  I dig it when staff lets us know what's not ordered regularly by the regulars....chicken and waffles for wifey, eggs and \"in the style of\" Belgium waffles.  Food was decent for diner style grubage, pricing was diner standard ($30 with tip for 2 peeps) the service is what will have us back- good job Jake-"}, {"review_id": "D8tXy-2YwgvYSIlqA2SxSA", "user_id": "vU9KKfK0W4mZ7JF-TIC1hA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Here's the deal with Pancake Joe's. It's an average breakfast spot with a variety of decadent breakfast food items. If you enjoy sweet for breakfast, then you'll likely find Pancake Joe's an alright place to eat.It's essentially a local version of an IHOP-type chain. The quality of food is on par with that sort of establishment. The problem is that I think the food industry is moving away from that kind of fare and offering lighter and healthier options. Pancake Joe's has been around forever, it's a local favorite, but like IHOP and its various incarnations, it hasn't evolved with the times. Do you *really* need to ingest a week's worth of calories in a single sitting? For example, this morning I had strawberry pankcakes with eggs and bacon. Very simple fare and it tasted medicore. There was no attempt to elevate the dish--one probably could have ordered this same exact plate of food when they opened back in the day. Moreover, I could have gotten similar food from any breakfast restaurant in town for less money and less waiting. What sets Joe's apart from the rest? I'm not sure. To be fair, they do have stuff like Eggs Benedict which is simply a fancy way of making an egg with a rich sauce or a frittata which is like a quiche so that might be a reason to wait 45 min on the weekend to eat at PJs. Essentially, then, you are paying a premium for medium-quality food. My meal this morning was $13 ($16 w/ tip). For that price at breakfast, I expect better quality ingredients--fresh fruit not frozen, not uber fatty bacon, or average pancakes-- That's not what you get at Joe's unfortunately. In addition, if you happen to go on the weekend, you are going to have to wait in long ass lines. San Antonio folk *love* waiting in line for average food. SMH. I just don't get it. It's like the people who wait hours in line for Olive Garden when there are many other local restaurants with better food and zero wait. But if that's your thing, more power to you. Joe's is a local staple, so supporting it is a good thing. Just set your expectations realistically when you go.One bright spot: I ordered my eggs over medium and they came back *perfectly* cooked.Also, the food is about the same as the Ingram location, which is also bigger, so you can prolly avoid some waiting time if you go there."}, {"review_id": "JXCUXqHnGMj3_hzuhOFXUw", "user_id": "1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Was in San Antonio and I'm the mood for breakfast so I YELP'd the highest rated breakfast spot in SA and here we are.========LOCATION========Kind've at the edge of town (I think), in a quaint little area with a Mexican restaurant next door and a Dollar General shop across the street. Decent size diner, a little bigger than it appears from outside.========THE FOOD========~ BANANA NUT PANCAKES - Wasn't sure which pancakes to get, was split between blueberry and pecan... couldn't decide so I decided BANANA NUT cause they never disappoint. SPOILER ALERT: It disappointed. Flavorless pancakes, the bananas had some browning on it. Wasn't good at all and I didn't even finish my short (2) stack. (2/5)~ TOAST - It was bland and had no taste. How do you mess up Toast in TEXAS?!~ SAUSAGE - It was the small patty type. It was horrible. Bland and tasteless. (1/5)~ BUTTER - I was shocked there was no butter on the pancakes or with the toast but I looked the right and there was small prepackaged butter wrapped up. Opened it, spread it and it had no taste and wasn't salty at all. It had the texture of whipped cream cheese. (1/5)~ SCRAMBLED EGGS - Undercooked, still a bit runny and watery. Had no flavor. I even added a ton of black pepper, salt and hot sauce after the first bites and it didn't help much. (1/5)==============FINAL THOUGHTS==============With 700+ reviews it was the most popular spot on Yelp for San Antonio and it reeeeeeeeeeeally let me down. My friend got Sunny Side Up eggs and toast and didn't like his meal either.Maybe I'm spoiled by L.A. eating... the Griddle and Crave cafes of the world but this food was really really bad. The only reason I didn't give it the rare 1-Star of death is because the service was really good so I gave an extra sympathy star.It's a family owned business (it says \"the Cruz family welcomes you\") and the hostess was really nice as was our server... but honestly, the food was bland and underwhelming.For a place called \"Pancake\" Joe's, their pancakes weren't good.Do yourself a favor and avoid."}, {"review_id": "Ay6dwiHEeFkY2fSVGmZmaw", "user_id": "tz6cjvbT4q2iGGVYG3o5gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Great food, about a 40 minute wait at 930 Sat am.

Absolutely wonderful I'm even impressed by the size of the meals.  All of the food is soooooooo good and the flavor of the eggs and omelets are eggcelent lol you see what I did there.

I ordered the pancakes and egg combo, but upgraded my pancakes to the fresh blueberry pancakes and added the ranch potatoes from the a la cart menu. Everything was made perfect! I have no complaints, if anything I'm more inspired. I loved the potatoes and now when I cook my own I want to mimic their recipe.

I got the Two Eggs and Potatoes, Banana Nut Pancakes and my Hubbies got the Cowboys Breakfast with add on bacon. Everything was yummy..The wait once you sit down was fast. But I will say we asked for a menu in advance so we could kinda decide what we wanted so we didn't have to wait any longer.

They told us it would be a thirty-minute wait, and we said heck we are here, so why not. They also offered that if the counter barstool area opened, we could have that space.After about 10 minutes, my name was called and we sat in the bar area. I thought it was really cool because that is where the server stations and the order-up area are, and it has some life to it. I ordered a coffee and some pancakes with scrambled eggs while my friend ordered the Cowboy Omelet and some waffles. We spent some time chatting, and our food came out.
