Again, if these issues were minor and I wouldn't have made a big deal out of it but I appreciate that he took the initiative and addressed it and that service is why I would return again, hopefully with a bigger apetite next time as the food did look tasty."}, {"review_id": "k2SUed3IpyXUTuZ5cG-Fvw", "user_id": "PQ1BXJ-xkLpbEDdPnoJq3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "First time at Snooze and it definitely did not disappoint. I was so glad they allowed customers to wait by the bar for some hot beverages since it was snowing outside. The lattes were great pick-me-ups after braving the cold weather. It was also really fun just watching the bartenders churn out drinks in high speed.Our table wasn't ready when the hostess took us. Because of this, we got a free \"pancake of the day.\" The pancake was fluffy and drizzled with both blueberry and cream cheese sauce, and also topped with some fresh blueberries. It was delicious!My bf ordered the Snooze Classic with poached eggs and sour dough toast with a side of breakfast taco. The jam tasted like Trader Joe's peach bellini spread and went so well with the toasty toast. I ordered the egg white scramble with mushroom, ham, and cheddar. Egg whites are so amazing because they are so packed with amino acids and have way less calories than the yolk. We also shared the pancake flight (sweet potato, sum'oa, and blueberry danish) and I'm sad to say I only liked the sweet potato one for being the least sweet. The other two were ridiculously sweet with tons of sweet drizzles, toppings, and fillings. They were just too heavy to taste and stomach.Overall, I had a blast at Snooze despite the wait time. Breakfast items were very satisfying."}, {"review_id": "v_Tmbig9tn27lHRcCkwe7A", "user_id": "BOh3_pP0Di-txZomArm4yg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Holy Cow!

I ordered the corned beef hash.  Another winner.  Tasted like it was made fresh as opposed to the kind you can buy ready-made in the can.  HUGE difference.  The one thing that I was a little disappointed with was my apple mimosa.  It tasted like more apple juice than sparkling wine.  It was good but I just expected a little more bubbly.  Despite that, I can't wait to visit the area again​ and try more from the menu!"}, {"review_id": "9tCe1dg0zBM6L6g6JFF_Zw", "user_id": "PJtyBsfzO7Xvgh8JdqcOCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Awesome selection service and food!  Loved the frittata and how all the ingredients were so freshPancake flight off the hook!!!"}, {"review_id": "Kb49yNsu0Em-oRzlYH1xiw", "user_id": "vZbZEE3v9MA4Tyl_Ns3Jnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "I love eggs....

I asked the waiter what he recommended. He said that they were known for their egg benedicts and pancakes. Being partial to a more savory breakfast, I decided that the Benny Duo Can't decide?! in which you get a half serving of two different benedicts. Upon the waiter's recommendation I ordered half servings of the...I like You E'Lote BenedictElote corn quinoa cakes topped with poached cage free eggs, chili lime hollandaise, cotija cheese and roasted corn salsa.- When I bit into this, I truly had a \"holy s***, this is amazing,\" reaction. I haven't had that in a long time. The sauce and egg provided a delicious creaminess while the seasoning and salsa provided the perfect spice and heat. The quinoa cake was also a unique touch to a benedict. Bella! Bella! BennyThin slices of prosciutto, Taleggio cheese, and perfectly poached eggs on toasted ciabatta, topped with cream cheese hollandaise, balsamic glaze and arugula. Ciao Bella!- This was equally amazing, though the flavors were some that I'm more accustomed to eating. All of the ingredients were of the highest quality which is what I think set this meal apart. The prosciutto was salty meaty goodness atop the ciabatta. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to cut through the bread with my knife to construct the perfect bite of all the ingredients but that was not the case. It was toasty and crunchy without being tough. The balsamic provided the perfect tart and sweet brightness to finish off the dish!The dish came with a side of hashbrowns. It was sort of a shaved hashbrown cake. You also had the choice of beans, greens, or fruit but I didn't know at the time nor do I regret the hashbrowns. Though it looks like any old fried potato cake, it really was bursting with flavor. It was salty as hashbrowns normally are but there was something else about it that made it unique that I can't quite describe. It also was a nice base to pick up a bite of hollandaise, and egg with. Being a \"ketchup kid,\" I did have a little of the ketchup and hot sauce with my hashbrowns (even though it was totally unnecessary). I was even impressed with the quality of these. The ketchup had more of a tomato paste quality to it (more acidity and less sweet than your traditional run of the mill brand). The hot sauce had heat and flavor that didn't overpower the dish."}, {"review_id": "TDmGNZloZcccDtlt9-UB0A", "user_id": "m-mDk1NFTzBrdpyHTiVJnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I'm glad we stopped here on a weekday morning because I can almost guarantee that it's super busy on weekends (it was pretty busy when we got there, but we were seated right away). This place has just moved up to the top of my favorite breakfast places to visit.I love trying different foods and going to a place that offers options to do so with one meal is an A+ in my book. I was able to order the Benny duo which had two different Benedicts-Bella Bella and Spring Harvest. I pretty much finished both which doesn't usually happen for me. The flavors of quinoa cheese cakes of the spring harvest and that of the prosciutto with the Bella Bella were fantastic! We got an order of the pancake trio with sum'oa, pineapple upside-down, and blueberry-ginger pancakes--fluffy and on point with flavors of delightful coconut, touch of cinnamon, and a whisper of ginger (I'd order them again right now!)If you're planning a trip to or through Denver, put this place on your must visit list!"}, {"review_id": "ckLM0GplP1dcE6iAcjvJgA", "user_id": "noEv1DBYDpQNVIS6xtC22Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "So so so good.

The flavors of both were unique enough that I wish all breakfast places gave the option of trying two types of benedicts! The corned beef hash was solid (the tortilla option vs toast was a nice option) but next time, I'll be more adventurous and try something more unique!

Don't even think about ordering more than one unless you have 2 stomachs. They are great if you want to share with the a group as a side.I highly recommend the brewmosa (blue moon and oj) along with the breakfast tacos... If you aren't up for all 3 tacos, they will make a smaller order.

The hollandaise sauce was a bit thick and heavy but very tasty. I also got you try the shrimps and grits. Shrimps very well cooked but the grits were a bit dry, very buttery though.

Benedict options on fleek AND you can mix and match your type of Benny's for no extra cost.The wait is long, but that's like any spot that's worthy and while you wait they have corn hole outside. We had a party of 10 and they were super accommodative and sat us at two tables near each other even during the rush.

We went on a Monday morning, and only had to wait 15 minutes. Oh, and it was like 15 degrees outside. Therefore, I cannot speak for the others who have waited longer.Being on vacation, I started with a \"Bangkok Bloody Mary\", which honestly was amazing. A perfect mixture of flavor and spice. Then I was intrigued by the \"Strong GPA\", so I ordered that too. Another solid choice for the taste buds. They have a solid menu of options, which makes choosing something to eat a little difficult. We managed to get the \"Sandwich I Am\" with a side of gravy. The sandwich was great but the gravy was more of a pot pie filling than a traditional style. We could not decide on one Benny, so we did the Benny Duo. Choosing the \"Bella! Bella! Benny\" and the \"Chili Verde Benedict.\" Each very different, and flavorful. We topped the breakfast off with a single \"Peanut Butter Cup Pancake\", which was a huge portion.

As for her selection. She ordered me a sweet potato pancake and a half order of Corned Beef Hash with an egg. So amazing!! A great combination between sweet and salty.  The Sweet Potato Pancakes are a signature sweet potato buttermilk pancakes topped with homemade caramel, candied pecans and ginger butter. The Corned Beef Hash is Snooze's signature shredded hash mixed with locally made corned beef, caramelized poblanos and onions. Topped with two eggs your style & toast or tortillas. Both were half orders and I was really happy to try both thing instead of just eating one.

A friend told me to check this place out so I saved it for my final meal in Denver. My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch around 12ish and boy was it packed. We waited for about 45 min. It was nice that there were things for us to do while we waited. There was bags outside and inside we played connect four and tic tak toe. The menu had so many great options it was super hard to narrow it down. When we sat down we were ready to order drinks right away. My friend got the mimosa and I got the mayan mocha (Ancho Reyes Liqueur, Espresso, Steamed Milk, Chocolate and Vanilla Syrup with a dash of cinnamon). My mayan mocha was delicious. I did not think I would have tasted any alcohol but boy, was I surprised. For food my friend and I both got the benny duos. My Friend chose the benny goodman (Lox style salmon and cream cheese served over toasted rye and topped with poached cage free eggs, cream cheese hollandaise blended with sun dried tomato and caper relish.) and a Bella! Bella! Benny (Thin slices of prosciutto, Taleggio cheese, and perfectly poached eggs on toasted ciabatta, topped with cream cheese hollandaise, balsamic glaze and arugula).  And I went with the Bella! Bella as well and traditional ham one. We also ordered 1 pancake to share which was the pineapple upside down YUMMMMM ( the table next to us recommended it) We devoured everything!!!!!! And we were not hungry again until we came back to Chicago around 10pm ish. Everything was delicious I high recommend checking this spot out when in Denver, you will not be disappointed."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/snooze-an-am-eatery-denver-12?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
