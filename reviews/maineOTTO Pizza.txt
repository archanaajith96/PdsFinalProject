I love the pizza here!!!!!! The only thing I do not like here is that the staffs do not seem friendly. The pizzas that they make here have thin crusts and is so good. And might I add, that they are better they some of the famous pizza places in NYC...cough *Grimaldi. They have this ridiculously delicious pizza with mash potatoes bacon and chives. Who knew carb on carb could be this good.BTW: this is place is open late!!!!!!"}, {"review_id": "Q69ofD4F1t6UAN_xltnaJw", "user_id": "l6RlZ31H6_a9GPvY83Y3Iw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Good place for a slice of pizza. Got the salami and ricotta slice and a BLT chopped salad. Salad was perfection. The slice was so-so. It tasted great, but it fell apart because the crust was so thin. I can't imagine eating it with my hands. Taste-wise, great! The salad is the economical win--for $8 (included additional blue cheese up charge), it could have been a meal. But I'll retry another pizza slice and hopefully the crust is a little thicker to stay in one piece during the eating."}, {"review_id": "ETZznTAvedu7-1A2kpvvxA", "user_id": "qUCHmPvFz3CLg_PtKpYg6Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Came here as a group of four. We already had our dinner elsewhere so we ordered two pies and beers (one mashed potato w bacon and scallion pizza, one Butternut squash ricotta and cranberry). There were plenty of tables when we went there on Tuesday evening. Ambiance is casual. The pizzas came out, and they were  very fresh out of the oven. Both were thin crust. Considering how much topping goes on the top, I don't think I would've wanted thick pan fried anyway (personal preference). The mashed potato was good and bacon was good; I wished there was more cheese to it. The butternut squash and cranberry was more like a dessert pizza. My husband deserved it as the \"thanksgiving\" style pizza. I definitely enjoyed the variations they made from the classic style we know. All the pizzas sounded unique, and I'll definitely revisit in my next Maine trip!"}, {"review_id": "MItlozemBHY6c3ZRRPQqXA", "user_id": "dCnxB2z1p8EqfM8jkaa-vw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "We stopped en route to Sunday River.

Settled down and decided to walk around town and just take in more of the day. Love this location as it is right on Congress St and Forest. Awesome to people watch. Sit here and looked out the window with a slice and a beer. Hey. Not a bad way to take it all in. First slice was in front of me in under five minutes. Love the mash potato slice. Having a second and my Session IPA. Can't go wrong. The decor is great.  The wood bar and the tile. Perfect!  Sit inside or outside. Watch the people go by and let me tell you. It's like having dinner and a show. Thanks"}, {"review_id": "8_1c67oRtIaxxkS1tuMbfQ", "user_id": "mF4TAn0T49wdx0T7JutA5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2017", "text": "When I am in Portland... I come to Otto. That is what I do. This location has two doors. One for takeout by the slice. One is a bar and a couple tables. Beer, wine, and cocktails. So here's the deal---the pizza here is fantastic. Me and 99% of yelp agree on that. The crust is delicious. Sauce is simple and perfect. Cheese is amazing. You come to Portland, you otto try Otto (see what I did there?). There are some amazing eats in this quaint little town, but for pizza Otto is the spot. This joint has some pretty crazy specials too (butternut squash and cranberry, corned beef and kraut).Hands down the best pizza in New England. That title I previously would've given to Santarpios in Boston. Otto took the crown today."}, {"review_id": "w6JAwGCk_CzDwk5Q92BPcw", "user_id": "mDIiJFbG5cNz9-taiGAASQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "Not a bad spot for a slice.

The line of people wanting to buy a slice was out the door. The seating area was full. Now we know why. The crust is thin, but not soggy. There is a plastic grid in the box to keep it crisp and from sticking to the cardboard. Ingenious! The four cheese pizza sounds boring, but it totally wowed us.  Anything with goat cheese on it scores!  We tried several of the other combo's on the unique menu and even did a custom. All were a hit with the crowd. The on-line ordering system was easy to use and the pizza's were ready when they said they would be even though they looked slammed. If you don't want to fight the crowd, this is the way to get your pizza."}, {"review_id": "y7PLJszthKXt-XX3wwQIfA", "user_id": "nG7RATWL7qvHw7Kh8uiWRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/4/2017", "text": "I'm shocked. And I'm an NYC/NJ pizza snob. This pizza was good, really good. After a few glasses of wine, we thought pizza would be the best thing... plus this place is open super late! Want pizza at 11pm? No problem.The slices are massive as the pies are cut into 6 slices and not the standard 8. We got a margherita, a plain, and the cauliflower/mushrooms. All the pizza was great, but the plain was incredible. Their sauce is super super tasty and it has the perfect amount of cheese. The pie is crispy and there's a decent crust. The pizza does have these strange little hard crumbles on the bottom,, but I actually really liked them.Slices were $3.50.

This has to be one of the BEST pizza places that I have ever graced. I cannot wait to try more of their variations during a happy hour, a relaxing Sunday, or a Friday late night. There's generous seating at the bar and table sections. Great for a couples or family night out. I HIGHLY suggest that you check this place out. And I challenge those that don't like pizza to check it out. I'm sure this place would quickly turn you into a Pizza Connoisseur!

I love Otto pizza it's probably my favorite in Portland. I have never eaten inside of this restaurant- it's a little small and I usually order pizza to go or delivery. The butternut squash riccotta pizza and mashed potato bacon are my favorites and the only two I usually order, because they are excellent. Yes, the pizza is expensive. Yes, they are delicious. I will continue to order these two pizzas and I have just discovered that there is an app where you can earn reward points on the pizzas so I will now be using that as well.

That being said, Otto's in downtown Portland serves some outstanding food. The menu has very unique options; we tried 'Mash Potato, Bacon & Scallion', 'Bacon, Meatball & Ricotta' and 'Mushrooms and Ricotta' by the slice. All three were very tasty and I would have any of them again! The ricotta cheese really was outstanding and made for perfect flavor pairing with mushrooms and the meatball/roasted tomato slices. The crust is thin, and a little crunchy, which differs greatly from what we're used to (in Chicago we measure our crust in inches, not only in diameter, but in height) but was all in all not bad.Our only complaint, there was no sprinkle-on parmesan available! But no-biggie! We Chicagoans carry a pack in our pocket everywhere we go!

When we made eye contact and motioned to our server, he never came over. After twenty minutes without even water, we got up to leave.

I loved the extremely thin and crunchy crust of Otto pizza.They have a dine-in restaurant and a take-out spot right next door. Otto is open till 2AM on weekends, but only in the take-out area. There are lines out the door at 1AM and fresh pies come out of the oven every few minutes, so that must mean something!I tasted two types of pizza here:1) Mashed potato, bacon and scallion pizza - a very unique style of pizza with the perfect blend of all the ingredients. I personally am not a huge fan of potatoes, but this was very tasty.2) Margherita Pizza - I wish I had more slices! This is one of the best margherita pizzas I've ever had. It was interesting that Otto uses real tomato slices rather than just tomato sauce.Overall, I'd highly recommend dropping by for a slice (or two or three!) regardless of how late it is. Make sure to have the pizza fresh as it'll taste best."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/otto-pizza-portland-3?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
