The folks working there are exactly what you'd expect in a college town. But they work hard to make the service quick and fun.I'm not sure I can come up with any suggestion for improvement other than opening one in Omaha!"}, {"review_id": "TTK6eGDGLvzVxWCqzeqLwQ", "user_id": "G9P3h7ZGdbdc_Zt6IKC2vQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "The Parmesan truffle fries are the star of the show here! Delicious! Perfect amount of Parmesan to fries. I didn't care for the ranch. The classic cheeseburger was decent - the gluten free bun was kind of hard - but props to even offering the gluten free bun option!! (50 Cent up-charge, which is fair). It's a cheap, decent place to grab a burger. I'd go back for the fries though!"}, {"review_id": "N1zqKox_8BXJSRDC_0IaJw", "user_id": "pruvSFRIOiCg27kCpaMg8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Burger places are all over the place. It's like the new trend- burger spots popping up on every corner. There's only one thing that sets some of them apart and that's good food, plain and simple. This place delivers it for sure!I ordered the Greatest Burger which is pretty much a typical burger with some special sauce on it. My cousin said it was thousand island but it tasted like a siracha ketchup to me. Either way it was decent. I ordered the burger medium well but it was definitely well, and part of the burger was a little overdone and dry. I also ordered the Parmesan truffle fries and they are amazing! They don't skimp on the seasoning and an order is big enough to share with someone. My cousin and I split the s'mores shake and I wasn't disappointed. Chocolate, graham cracker, and mini toasted marshmallow on top made for a sweet treat. Definitely split this as well, as our two small portions were plenty.My only grudge with this place is how they cook their burgers. It says \"medium well or more.\" You mean \"medium well and well.\" There's no more, unless you count burnt. But face it, burgers are better when there is at least a smidge of pink in the middle, if not more. Personally, I like my burgers medium rare because the flavor and juices are sealed in."}, {"review_id": "Hr7SOKpXw-8NugqXRJc5nA", "user_id": "U8pOSPUOgFt1FX96_HkdUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Gluten free options: Bun ($0.50 extra but THANK YOU!!!), Fries.... yes!

I'm getting Fireside double, parmesan fries and bananarama shake. Beth having similar with variations. Busy here and food looks great as it goes to other customers. Nice setting in stripmall and cool decor. So the food...wow. Maybe the best burger ever. And a single patty would have been way enough. Large patties even though advertising says 6oz. No way. Maybe 3/4lb is a closer estimate. Fries are real potatoes. Shakes we had were real good, but chemicals for flavor. If they would match the shake quality to the burgers...would be over the top amazing.

My husband and I have been twice. The first time I had the burger with tomato chutney, red onion, & feta cheese and fries. Wow! Loved the fries! Very tasty! The burger, Sorry I forget the name, Athena? Um, I ate it but the feta was making the meat taste off. I just kept telling myself, it's just the feta, it's just the feta!  The second time I had the American (?) just a plain ol burger. I had extra pickle, I'm sure I asked for extra tomato & the gal said they don't have tomato(?) I thought that was strange. Next visit I'll try the vegan with gluten free bun. It can be very noisy in there if it's busy around lunch. Have the fries!
