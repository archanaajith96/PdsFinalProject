But priorities. I made a quick stop at Jack's Stack BBQ since I was already working out of a coffeeshop in Country Club Plaza and needed to eat dinner at some point. The most glorious part about this restaurant is their entirely separate carry-out section! I walked in (there are also some curbside spots) and the tiny waiting space was empty. The cashier was so friendly, and it was quite obvious that I wasn't from around there. He totally called me out. Hilarious!Upon his recommendation, I got the beef brisket, pork burnt ends, cheesy corn, and beans. The order was prepared in no time at all! They're very precise here, and I'm sure I would have gotten equally amazing service if I dined in.Even though the food cooled down a bit until the time I ate it, it was still so good. The cheesy corn was a little overrated, but the beans with burnt ends... My mouth waters just thinking about it. The burnt ends and brisket were both fantastic, too. Definitely different than Q39 but loved it just as much. Yum!"}, {"review_id": "OznBnt_kaUCmQxMu32As3Q", "user_id": "NCETUMb69aeRykWUuveGLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I've lived in KC my whole life and have had Jack Stack catered before but have never been to one of the Jack Stack restaurants until last night. It was the first nice day of spring and the patio was full. A table for 2 was a 20 minute wait. Not a bad wait with the weather being so nice and the wonderful aroma coming from the restaurant.Once inside the restaurant, our server was very attentive to us and offered a number of drink and food recommendations. Tables were bussed in a timely manner and the whole reataurant staff seemed to be very professional and enjoy working there. The restaurant is beautiful and upscale compared to some of KC's other BBQ places, however it was pretty noisy. We didn't have to wait very long for our food to come out of the kitchen.The BBQ of course was outstanding. We ordered the Jack Stack sandwich and the Southern Jack sandwich with sides of cheesy corn bake and fries. Every bite was just great. I prefer the spicy BBQ sauce over original. Would be a great place to bring out of towners. Will be back to try the Smokin' Russ."}, {"review_id": "EHPfPOCWqvKmW7nTtMATCw", "user_id": "20lECHGeqxAx3xrpSubo5w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Very good. High end, lots of yuppies but very good bbq. Highly recommend the cheesy corn - it's interesting and I've never had anything like it. Beef ribs are great, pork even better, but the burnt ends... meh I can live without. I've been there three times and its definitely a destination place.  Gates is better and consistent. Joe's Garage is even better. Arthur Bryant's the best.  Nice area of town, parking is s real bugaboo."}, {"review_id": "fnJOmAW6ZoyO0NlnLeSROg", "user_id": "IOX4m9-sWTcjaqDy3r_O8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Woah, bomb.com.

Food wise the first visit was better but better service on the second visit. My first visit we went crazy with the menu and ate like piggies, everything was so delicious. I couldn't wait to return. We dined with an ex-KC Chiefs player and it just so happened the owner was dining as well somewhere in the restaurant, saw him and took care of our bill. The server didn't tell us until we waited awhile for our bill.My second visit the food was just ehhh, the burnt ends were terrible but the rest of the BBQ was ok. It was chunks of fat and barely any meat. The chicken breast was slightly dry and the ribs were decent. I was most impressed with the sides. The cheesy potatoes and baked beans were ON POINT, absolutely fantastic! The service was amazing. Jefferey at the bar will take care of you...go see him. I will definitely return and try the bbq again."}, {"review_id": "YRzCG1-mnplCvdDxUFkBKQ", "user_id": "f2DoVGoxI0-GFcJ5D5642Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I'm not a Barbecue aficionado so I don't think too deeply about the different styles of barbecue or how they compare; I simply employ the taste taste.

He was very upset to hear that my last 2 experiences were disappointing. I told him that Jack Stack was my go to place for quality BBQ, but after what I experienced recently, I was afraid to ever come back. He informed me that Jack Stack should never have an \"off day\". They should always be on top of it when it comes to quality BBQ. I explained to him that if it was my first time dining at Jack Stack, I probably would've never came back. He wanted to earn my business back so he took down my home address and sent me a care package. I received a package of burnt ends, one crown prime beef rib, cheesy corn, and bbq baked beans. It was packaged nice and neatly and even came with instructions on how to properly heat it up. I followed the instructions and heated it up for dinner and it was amazing! The crown prime beef rib was sooooo tender and moist, just like I remembered the first time I had it. The burnt ends were tender and flavorful. The sides were solid per usual. This care package brought back memories of the quality Jack Stack is known for and quite frankly, has won back my heart. The manager really went above and beyond to make up for my past 2 experiences. When Jack Stack fell short, he took it upon himself to find a way to redeem them. After the last 2 experiences I had, I thought I would never come back to Jack Stack. Now that I've been reminded of how good it can be, I will definitely give it another shot whenever I'm back in KC."}, {"review_id": "G1_epPEUI37vfK5aqBsWbA", "user_id": "QPjcIpAoZdmYFCk0Jxu69w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "There are a lot of great barbecue places in KC but I especially love taking out of town guests here because it's a little more upscale than the rest of the barbecue joints here. My parents came to visit and they were not disappointed. Not to mention it's a great location, where you can eat then stroll around the plaza to try and burn off some calories!My dad ordered the salmon with the strawberry spinach salad and he was impressed. It's now one of his favorite places to get salmon at. Me and my mom ordered the Poor Russ which is chopped burnt ends on a bun. Out plates were practically licked clean. And can't forget about the cornbread with honey butter. It's melt in your mouth cornbread with cheddar and jalapeños and the butter complements it so well. Making me drool just thinking about it. Service was also exceptional. We were seated right away and our water glasses were always full and and we were checked on frequently to make sure our food was prepared to our liking. Overall a fantastic experience."}, {"review_id": "vi42V0NmpOVzAcSDyvad1w", "user_id": "0XSiDHRbWde6Tx01f0klLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "BBQ so good it'll make you wanna slap your mama...but don't do that because you'll regret making that decision. A great dinner spot down by the Plaza if you're lookin for some of the best BBQ meats that KC has to offer! I ordered the 2-meat BBQ combo for $20. Beef Burnt Ends, Lamb ribs and my sides were baked beans and their cheesy corn. Holy wow. the burnt ends are no joke. They are like miniature, meaty chunks of smoky barbecue perfection. The lamb ribs were very tender and practically fell off the bone. You're also going to wanna do yourself a solid and order the baked beans and cheesy corn as well. Our waiter was very polite. I was stuck between the sausage and beef burnt ends and without hesitation he told me beef was the way to go. I love honest opinions like that! In the short time that I was in KC, I noticed that BBQ could be categorized by tier. There are \"meh\" places that are inexpensive and get the job done when that craving hits. There are also hoity toity places that deliver a finer BBQ experience, and then there are gems like Jack Stack that are affordable and tasty! My mouth is watering just writing this review.

I joined four friends here for lunch. We originally stopped here to greet a friend that recently joined the Jack Stack Barbecue team; however, we quickly discovered that we were at the wrong location. Well we never connected with our friend, we did enjoy a very nice lunch. Being new to Kansas City barbecue, I ordered the Jack Stack Sampler. The Sampler included barbecue chicken, pork spare ribs & a choice of burnt ends. The portion was very generous, and the service was prompt. This was especially impressive given the size of the restaurant and the number of customers. The Cheesy Corn Bake and the Creamy Coleslaw were nice additions to the entrée."}, {"review_id": "DvfVhj4m8n6-79hAVwvqVA", "user_id": "Kl8Ei6zu8lsXKJ0tffXPWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "We actually started out trying to have a very late lunch/early dinner at the Freight House location of Jack Stack - that is, until we found out there would be over an hour wait. Nope. Not happening. A quick call to the Plaza location, revealed we could have a table waiting for us while we made the quick trip from one location to the other. This family loves our Joe's BBQ but Jack Stack was pretty impressive too, in a different, more refined way. My daughter and I actually split the salmon plate and I truly appreciated that it came already split and beautifully plated on two different dishes. While I know this place is obviously famous for their bbq, the salmon was tender and incredibly tasty. The family members who ordered brisket and burnt ends and bbq liked everything they ordered. They did notice that no extra bbq sauce is given at the table. The general consensus was that Jack probably figures his bbq is perfectly seasoned and doesn't need any further tinkering with via heavy sauces. On request, however, the waiter did cheerfully bring my son ample containers of both the mild and the tangy sauces. A surprising touch came with being offered hot spiced cider as a drink option. It was a lovely addition to the holidays and very tasty. I was offered a refill, presumably with no extra charge, though I didn't take it. The tower of onion rings was quite the thing to behold. When I saw those massive towers going out to other diners, I kinda wished I'd ordered some. They look amazing. There is an abundance of booth seating in this location and parking across the street in one of the garages placed around the Plaza. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of the food served."}, {"review_id": "fE17T5An6hFwx1_SzYPnLA", "user_id": "dQNUxnK9Lhc4k0sghYxgrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "Today was our first time eating at Jack Stack and it will not be our last. We arrived at around 4 pm with no reservation and sat in the bar, there were plenty of open tables. Our server, John, greeted us promptly and was very friendly, giving us his personal recommendations after hearing we had never been there before. We opted to share the cornbread appetizer as per his rec, which was delicious - very moist and flavorful, sweet with a hint of jalapeño baked in a small skillet. Three of us shared a 3-meat combo: brisket, burnt ends, and chicken, with coleslaw and cheesy baked corn as our sides. All was delicious, and we were excited to learn that the coleslaw was bottomless. Free coleslaw refills are truly what dreams are made of. Our meal was rounded out by John's final (and best) recommendation: The Carrot Cake. It was my brother's birthday, so it was on the house and we couldn't refuse it. John referred to it as \"life changing\" so we were very intrigued. It was easily the best carrot cake I have ever had, and probably ever will have. Unlike most chilled carrot cakes, this one comes out warm with the cream cheese glaze-like frosting dripping down the sides. It truly was life changing.

You have to try the beans. Don't come here without ordering them. The potato bake are scallops that are extra cheesy.  It's delightful as well. Plenty of options to try, you cant really go wrong.

I heard and read the rave reviews for Jack Stack's but to be honest my expectations were low considering how highfalutin the place seemed compared to a stereotypical Barbecue road side place with cheap red and white checkered table cloths. I was wrong to prejudge the place. Jack stack has some of the best beef brisket I have ever tasted. I have never tasted Franklin's barbecue in Texas but I have tasted multiple brisket in and around Kansas City. I became a certified barbecue judge for the express reason that I'm trying to find that taste and quality of brisket from the world's top Pitmasters similar or close to what I had at Jack Stack.Would that Jack Stack opened an outlet in Washington, D.C. Oh, a man can dream. Oh, a man can pray. Until those prayers are answered I have to be satisfied by getting on a plane and visiting Jack Stack when I'm in Kansas City. The burnt ends are a delicacy. They belong on the American food Mount Rushmore. I would put them up against anything I have tasted in the world and I guarantee the burnt ends would, pardon the pun, stack up well. I still dream almost daily about those darn burnt ends. I can't replicate it and I have found that most Pitmasters places can't replicate it either. The burnt ends are the perfect carnivore's food.Besides the burnt ends the chicken is fantastic. And all the sides I've tasted were A-1. To some ardent barbecue lovers this will come as a sacrilege but I do not eat pork.  Therefore I cannot render judgment on the outstanding looking ribs or the pulled pork. The service at the establishment is fantastic including the separated carry out section. If you are barbecue Connoisseur like me, and ask nicely, the Pitmaster may show you the wood piles and the smoker. I love the location hard by the train tracks and in a former industrial area. It has that post industrial feel that a lot of places try and fail to recreate.  The restaurant is still nice enough that you can have a fancy formal dinner. This is no knock on the place but for me, I don't add a lot of their house barbecue sauce to the brisket. But the sauces at Jack Stack are fantastic, just not in the same heavenly category as Gates (Hi, may we help you!) in my humble opinion. I do add Gates' sauce to Jack Stack meat. Perfect KC pairing!!!Bottom line, the food deserves a lot more than five stars. The restaurant and its decor deserves more than five stars. And if there were an infinite star machine I could properly dispense enough stars to accurately rate the burnt ends."}, {"review_id": "bUn2zS12eHbzYnyEDPGjcw", "user_id": "hLOOvmAqOJtUN9n_nfcDcQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "Hubby & I, DD#1 and two others met for dinner at Jack Stack Barbecue on the Plaza last night and had a very good evening.  Barbecue is one of my favorites and we have enjoyed many of Kansas City's top places.  Jack Stack is up there with the best of them.We started out with an appetizer of Grilled Sausage Medallions served with crispy toast rounds and a really good spicy mustard sauce, which helped take the edge off our hunger while we waited for the entrees.  Service was very quick on all items so we didn't have long to wait. Hubby ordered the Burnt Ends Dinner which he paired with french fries and baked beans.  Dear Daughter & I got Hatfield Sandwiches, both with brisket and ham, and ordered the cheesy potatoes as our sides.  I let Hubby have a bite of the cheesy potatoes and he said \"I'm getting those instead of fries next time\".  And he is right...they are really yummy! One of our dining companions ordered ribs with cheesy potatoes and the other had a sliced brisket dinner with cheesy corn and baked beans.  Several had to get to-go boxes, as the portions were very generous.  Both the food and the service was very good and we had a relaxing, enjoyable dinner in attractive surroundings.  Always a plus!"}, {"review_id": "NUWW61aPS9zYZFjoaULIGw", "user_id": "TkXuyneKFoxgoz9GlGT9UA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "The food was pretty decent and the service was on point.
