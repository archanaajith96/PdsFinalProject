I came by here for take out while in town visiting and was blown away by the quality of food. I ordered through the yelp app and my food was ready on time. I for one LOVE lamb kebabs so of course I had to get the tikka lamb. The dish came with seasoned rice, grilled veggies, pickled salad, and pita bread. The lamb was super tender and reminded me of the kebabs I had in the Middle East. The meat was very flavorful and juicy. The rice has a nice spice that I really enjoyed. For dessert I got the Syrian halawa el jibn. The dish is a cheese based dessert topped with pistachios. This was my first time trying this dessert and I really loved it. The rose water gave it a unique taste while the cheese was creamy. Everything was delicious!"}, {"review_id": "RJ7I7qYiITOIuW2WS5wOEQ", "user_id": "j2kVpPUkb0_HFHqd0NUElQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Come here if you want to find a real authentic mediterranean food. I got the Falafel platter and the Chai tea. You can tell that they put a lot of effort and care in each of the items thats on the plate. Falafel was crunchy, flavorful, and cute (heart shaped). Pita bread was so light and fluffy, almost like melting in your mouth. Hummus was very smooth and delicate. Cauliflower was lightly breaded so it didn't leave that greasy feeling, used fresh oil to fry because it came out clean.Hot Chai Latte was amazing, 100x better than those factory made starbucks one. Sweetened with honey, real chai fragrant, also light and foamy.Place is quite casual, space is quite limited if they're going to be busy, they had around 12 tables, better come early! A must try hidden gem in colorado springs!"}, {"review_id": "zaAFjwtDf7UzCAy913WxhQ", "user_id": "96TQfoNOtJAQaNaIzplPyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Absolutely love this place. Everything we have had was just delish. The guy who works there, I think his name is Ali - he's as cute as can be and is so excited about the food. We've loved everything we have tried: falafel, hummus, pita, stuffed grape leaves, chicken balls, lamb ribs, beef ribs, kebab, absolutely everything.  And the pistachio baklava just melts in your mouth. Cardamom tea is yummy. Busy on Friday and Saturday nights. We go in no hurry. The food is always worth the wait. One of our faves in Colorado Springs."}, {"review_id": "p6bj1jlLyKQxf9V29Xx1sQ", "user_id": "-lVQNoOqmKq9j6N0MOh50g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Took my mother to dinner here while visiting Colorado Springs. What an awesome find!  The location is in a strip center and looks unassuming from the outside. Inside, you are transported far away. The restaurant is quaint with beautiful lamps. I HIGHLY recommend the cardamom tea. It was wonderful. If I could have purchased teabags, I would have. Apparently they make their own mix of cheese. It is served in a beautiful teapot with unique cups and stirring spoons. The food was wonderful. Everything was fresh.  This is my new favorite in Colorado Springs. Give it a try!"}, {"review_id": "46L2BiMwOxeDpwP0EPFLvA", "user_id": "E1Pr6FH-6VTBWonPdtnhvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Absolutely the most authentic food we've eaten in the area, and we know from authentic as opposed to what you'd usually find in this town of chains and cafeteria food. They were left short staffed and had a huge party and most of the tables were full. The server was all by himself but still managed to attend to everyone with a smile and an apology. We ate the Dolmas before we could snap a picture, that's how good they were. The Cardamom tea was amazing and didn't even need sugar. The hummus and falafel were fresh and light (not oily lumps of coal like some other places do) and the chicken and beef Shawarma were beyond tasty and the pita wraps were obviously homemade. Most importantly, many of the guests were of Arabic decent. That's a sure sign that the food is going to be good and authentic and it was. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}, {"review_id": "0ncHRLwdabpmZPgusSQaNw", "user_id": "jMMG1afTcMumHcTYLTiJGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "The atmosphere was wonderful and very inviting.

The chicken shwarma wrap was very flavorful and the veggies in it really balanced it well. There was Sriracha on the table and it really goes well on the sandwich, if you want a little extra heat. The veggie tawook was exceptional. The grilled vegetables are very well seasoned and are addictive. We thought we hated beets! But the pickled beet in the salad was very good & was a great addition. The ticka lamb was moist and had a good lamb flavor... wasn't gamey. The man who waited on us always had a smile, and he was so friendly & nice. We really enjoyed our lunch."}, {"review_id": "KS19dJ2gbQKToomYwo8Xag", "user_id": "F4Q2UCbKfgrLrJcOMtGAZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Great spot.

Really,  everything was sooooo delicious and fresh. The falafel was well seasoned and it wasn't overcooked or dry.  Can't say enough good things about the food.  Plus, they take care to plate food in a visually appealing manner too, which isn't something you usually see in smaller places like this. It's just another way to show how much they care."}, {"review_id": "Z3eGDKP154XIzpRpPD5ifA", "user_id": "0s-1csMKKbZLPr6-NO6d-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "I was very impressed with how fresh and tasty the food was here.

I had the chicken shawarma, hummus plate and my wife had the grilled lamb plate. All of it was excellent. The shawarma was close to what I've had overseas but used a thicker pita bread than I was used too but was still yummy.

If you love sweets then you're in luck!  They have a variety of traditional pastry including baklava as well as local ice cream.  Our meal ended on a sweet note in the form of pistachio baklava!  It's worth every calorie!SERVICE: I believe the store owner served us during our meal and he was the nicest person!  Very polite and helpful with our orders.DECOR: Don't let the strip mall store front fool you, the interior is tastefully decorated in traditional decor.  We love the fancy tea set displayed at the front!  You instantly feel at peach when you talk in.VERDICT: If you're looking for delicious and homemade Middle Eastern food in the area, Arabian Nights is a must stop!  You'll be treated to fresh and authentic food prepared with love.  It's also very vegetarian friendly.  You will leave feeling satiated not stuff!  I'd frequent this place if I lived closer."}, {"review_id": "LFOXyegH8zQBCLf31aVyPg", "user_id": "ioXj0DfgplNB5bMgPhY4-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Food was really good and the people were really nice and answered any questions I had.

The falafel platter came with hummus, french fries, and salad. We of course had to get dessert and were very pleased with the selection.
