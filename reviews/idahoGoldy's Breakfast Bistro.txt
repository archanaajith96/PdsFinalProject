Given that I was visiting Idaho, I chose the chicken fried steak - definitely a regional delicacy. I was not disappointed. The steak was fried in a nice panko crust to golden brown perfection, then covered with a healthy portion of gravy. The steak was tender and not full of chewy, sinewy meat. The plate came with perfect overeasy eggs and ideal homefries. I haven't had such good homefries in many years - they were well-seasoned, and slightly fried on some edges, which provided a welcomed crunchy texture. The waitstaff was prompt and friendly - on point with water and coffee refills. The wait for food was probably a little longer than average, but the restaurant was packed and they have a small kitchen. So, if you are in a rush, you may want to reconsider your breakfast plans. The other members of my breakfast party were pleased with their dishes - any of the variations of their  eggs benedict looked fantastic."}, {"review_id": "3dMhfjWccIdjb4rwHWWZsg", "user_id": "G9P3h7ZGdbdc_Zt6IKC2vQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Chorizo and Italian cheese blend omelette with sweet potato hash - I wanted to love it. I really did. The hash browns were fairly burnt, but the parts that weren't were buttery and delicious. The omelette just lacked usual omelette yumminess. The chorizo is cut in cubes vs all chopped up- I think it could've used more cheese as well. Lots of young people working there (no shade being thrown - I'm still pretty young myself!) It's small but cute. Has a nice little bar area which is good if you're alone. This missed the mark with me."}, {"review_id": "mpK7em-u_YHln5ZGU2eoMA", "user_id": "-hN7OP0Zk6wh1LnS4Zqb9Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "We visited Goldy's while in Boise for a family reunion. I have to say that Boise has changed a LOT since I was here last (about 15 years ago), and it has become far more cosmopolitan than I remembered. The food scene has exploded, and we ate a couple of really excellent meals there. Therefore, we had high hopes for Goldy's...First off, be prepared to wait - like at least 30 minutes - for a table. We did wait since the hype was fairly intense. We were ultimately seated in the upstairs gallery. Cute, but when you're as tall as I am, it's a bit of a pain (especially when using the restroom). We ordered some bacon and eggs, and the chicken fried steak, plus a side of my favorite breakfast food - biscuits and gravy.The food arrived in a timely fashion, correctly prepared (eggs over-medium and crispy hash browns) and it looked amazing. After the first couple of bites of the the steak, I had to conclude that the salt and pepper were not properly distributed through the breading. One bite would be wildly salty, the next peppery, then hardly any flavor the next time. The consistency was perfect but the taste was just not so great. The rest of the food was also just OK, with the bacon being a bit underwhelming as well (too thin and a bit bland). I hate to write a less-than-stellar review of a place so obviously loved and well-reviewed, and I suppose that with the buildup and buzz surrounding the restaurant (and the long wait), we were expecting a lot more. The service was great, as is the location and atmosphere, but the food fell a little flat for us..."}, {"review_id": "-rliHvv_F01oEPRCSaKaMA", "user_id": "S8X3Ah34aM3fnsgIkSwOkg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "Short Version: If being rude to your guests is your thing then Goldy's has it down. I did not get a chance to eat at Goldy's so this review is only on my experience with the rude old man who was hosting yesterday (2/21). I walked in and didn't realize the host was to the right of me. He did not say hello. Once I noticed him he just stared at me. He kept staring at me and it made me feel completely unwelcome. I was a dining alone & just wanted a table, but he just shrugged at me and pointed to the counter. EVERYONE told me to eat at Goldy's so I'm really upset that my experience was so poor. I'm so glad I passed though, I went down the street to Elmer's and it was delicious !"}, {"review_id": "Lpydx8GXSfSBqkvUelSc3g", "user_id": "RGJ3UrTouNKj-tzW5Awwxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Every experience that I've had at Goldy's has always been mediocre. It was good, but expensive. The chicken fried steak was good, but not the best. There was always a \"but\" when someone would ask my opinion. Yesterday my opinion changed for the better! Everyone is always raving about this place & now i can say \"wow that was a great breakfast.\" I ended up getting the salmon fillets with the peps (roasted potatoes with cheese and peppers) with my eggs over medium well (which no one can ever execute correctly but they did ) & some sourdough toast. Mr. Euro got the breakfast burrito with ham & loved it. I loved the salmon fillets. They flaked perfectly & we're delicious. The peps were great & the toast wasn't soaking with butter or missing butter, just perfect. The reason why I'm giving four stars instead of five is the issue on price. I wanted to do a scramble/omelette & it was almost $16 to add TWO items. So to do a normal omelette/scramble with some veggies & cheese would've been $20. That's just ridiculous. I know that I'm not the only person who thinks this in regards to price, people will still come though regardless of price, but i think dropping the prices down to a normal breakfast price would be the smartest thing to do."}, {"review_id": "A8X37JhTMBKcfW4iQ5qqhg", "user_id": "pWvOl-zPFX80NEL2YyR7rg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Had been wanting to eat here for an couple weeks.

I assumed the line was because the food was in such great demand and so my wife and I had breakfast there. I had a design your own omelet with bacon, sundries tomatoes, and extra extra cheese. (Unfortunately the cheese was marginal in taste and there certainly wasn't as much as I had hoped for). On the side I had cottage cheese. My wife had a build your own omelet as well and toast. We both agreed sadly that neither of our meals were that phenomenal and certainly not as good as other Boise restaurants. The decor needs to be updated and cleaned and it's outdated and dark. It's small inside and I believe the line to wait was because of the small space not the quality of the food. I didn't find anyone of the employees or staff to be exceptionally friendly but not necessarily mean or anything.

The staff is all super friendly and treat you like you're at home.  Everything is cooked to order in an open kitchen.  The 3 cooks on hand were all very efficient and made some killer breakfast!I ordered a 2 egg combo.  The eggs were ok and the biscuit was just meh.  None of that matters because I ate the best corned beef hash I have ever had!  Maybe it was the fresh Idaho potatoes...but this was amazing!  The large portion of caramelized corned beef and potatoes was salty and satisfying. It was crispy and had an almost smoky taste.  My side of bacon was equally impressive, but the corned beef has stole the show.  I heard they are known for Egg Benedict - I suppose that may be good too.If you are in town you realty should try this place!  I would wait even if it is crowded - it is that good!"}, {"review_id": "M46mSCoo6bxaDN4npw7UPA", "user_id": "nMpmqzbFbeSvM5g8wb42Qg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "First time there.
