I actually found them on Yelp. So far, nothing but good food, good service, and overall a good experience.I went with my sister this time. They have live performances on Friday and Saturday. We were delighted to find this out tonight (4/7) and enjoyed the music while sipping on a cocktail, which was VERY tasty. My sister had the Cherry Limeade, which was very yummy when I tried some. I had the Blood Orange tea (I thinks what it was called; I just remember it had something to do with a Blood orange lol) and that was just as tasty. We both ordered off the gluten free menu, which had a pretty good selection of food. We tried the Buffalo Chicken dip appetizer and it was GREAT. Spicy, but very tasty. Then, we both ordered the grilled shrimp skewers and we both agree that those were the highlight of the night! I had mine grilled in Ol' Smokey sauce (my fave!) and Garlic sauce, which matched the shrimp PERFECTLY. Soo good. I chose broccoli and fiesta rice for the sides and was delighted to find that both were well seasoned and overall delish! I've had the wings in the past, but I think from now on, I'm getting the shrimp skewers; they were that good.All in all, good food, good drinks, good atmosphere. Give it a try (for the shrimp, if nothing else :p)"}, {"review_id": "vc7XiqcI8wWoZu_sJfkV6g", "user_id": "Ej_TweBra1a7nX06zubtww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Man! I cannot believe how long I've slept on this spot. I was slightly hesitant because it has that chain restaurant vibe but seriously the wings are so good and I'm definitely coming back when I'm in the area again. They have a fantastic lunch special where you get 12 wings (2 flavors) and endless fries with a soup or salad. Don't waste time with the salad though because you can't make friends with salad. There's really not too much to say here honestly. This place is straight up just a really good wing spot . Definitely come here with a date or after a softball game or whatever. It beats out BWW by a landslide"}, {"review_id": "HwT0Seb-8o_CCkepaJPWtw", "user_id": "TmoUWAbpApLDatLDnPTlKA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Wild wing Cafe! The flavors of sauces they have here is unlike anything you've ever experiencedI dined here with a group of Co workers, about 20 plus, and the service was great for the amount of people we hadThe atmosphere here is chill, they got sports on TV all the time, great place to watch the gameThe beer selection is not bad either, definitely gotta give the mixed drinks a taste My overall experiences here are always a good time!

Wild wing cafe was one of the few places that was still open. We phone in our order for pickup. When we arrived we sill had to wait a but but it was okay because they had a live band playing which help the time pass by. Everything smelled great and the boxes were still warm. The drive back to the hotel was painful because I wanted to eat one. They have the best wings! I loved the honey mustard wings here. Its not saucy and the wings and the right amount of crispy and the chicken falls off the bone. I would also recommend getting a side of their breaded chicken wings. I wish there was a location near me."}, {"review_id": "se0yL9hnfVJpx4yN3ZZpJA", "user_id": "AukB9dGtCrSsuNSLB87tTw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "I've heard of this place for a while from friends. Then all of a sudden, my friends decided to treat my girlfriend and I to it after helping them with some house issues during the Snow Monster that ate Hampton Roads. Sadly, I just had wings two nights before but you know me, I'm always down for food! My lady and I split a Full order of wings. Went with three sauces, Ginger, General, and something spicy... I can't remember but it didn't melt my face. The sauces were good delicious and the chicken was pretty crispy. The issues I have is the amount of blood that's still in the chicken and the size. Sure, they're healthy non roided out birds but either they're too young or the blood hasn't been soaked from them. Other places I've been, I never came across this issue with the entire batch of wings. It came randomly and not often... But not with these baby birds. We had fries on the side and they were undercooked. I didn't say anything about it because I'm used to that from my childhood. There could be improvement with this operation...Not a terrible place overall though. Great service and a nice brew selection. I just don't think I'll have the wings next round."}, {"review_id": "ReJslUwWBWJt6usjzkrobw", "user_id": "pTeWxZ_FTOXlPbMNzVsMRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Hubby and I love this place! They have reaally delish wings! We've been quite a few times,  never had a crazy wait or any issues with our food or service. The biggest problem has been a waitress that takes a bit too long to come to the table, but even that wasn't too bad.

They said if I need a table, we have to wait for 20min so we found chairs so we sat down at the bar. I came for eating some wings but their menu have a calories for every food so I felt guilty to eat wings then I ordered some wrap with home fried chips because it seems like a lil bit healthier than wings.

So we visited this place only to my surprise that I have been here before plenty of times (I'm getting old) I seemed to remember the China Syndrome so we ordered that a plethora of wings with crazy flavors such as, \"the general\" \"red dragon\" \"slayer\" \"honey lime sriracha\" \"the boss\" \"gold rush\" and \"atomic meltdown\". I think my favorite still is China Syndrome and Gold Rush, after we crushed a crap load of wings, we washed it down with a few $4 fireball shots. P.S. They give you a nice towel for you to wipe your hands in as well. Our server was super attentive and nice, the restaurant itself had live music playing and was busy but not overly ridiculous.Can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "87C0kiS_sMzVOJboz84SAQ", "user_id": "mEoWBg9ZxE9fSeR2Fq7-mg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Came to see a friend play.

That's not a hard diss or anything, and I've noticed that people REALLY love this place, but in truth, it's just fine. And I mean JUST fine. If you want wings and a half-decent beer list, then come here.The staff was friendly. The food came out quickly and it tasted fine. Wild Wings is better than Buffalo Wild Wings in that their wings don't totally and utterly suck like BWW. I had a couple of Smartmouth beers, and they have sports on every TV. All of that works just fine for me. The rating says it all. A-Ok. I'd kill some time here if I needed to.

We were all exhausted and wanted someplace quiet and relaxed to eat. While I doubt this place is quiet much, we were more than pleased with our visit. Our son has a severe gluten allergy so the fact they have menus specifically for people with allergies was a huge bonus! We always struggle when we are out finding things for him to eat. We were also thrilled with the outdoor seating option and the fact they allowed pets on the patio. We often have a dog or two in tow and having this option available definitely opens up options for us. Our waitress was polite and efficient. Very prompt with refills and friendly too. Let's get to the food. We tried the chicken and friends or something like that. Essentially a chicken dip. It was AMAZING! Really really enjoyed that. And it's gluten free! We had three different varieties of Wong to try out a few flavors. We had the honey mustard, chipotle bbq and the parmesan. All delicious but the bbq was my favorite. I have always been a die hard Hooters dan but this may be my new wing spot. Absolutely delightful!"}, {"review_id": "5_002tdihQNJmXL8Jw6icA", "user_id": "sqxx1GRQxBgKHAb5KpfQ8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/3/2017", "text": "I love coming here on Thursdays because it's taco happy hours, best part is that the happy hours last from 5pm to midnight.

Hubby got wings with flavors of chipotle jolt and honey lime sriracha, loved the honey lime sriracha, that's my fave flavor. The waitress was super accommodating and sweet to us. Definitely love great customer service because gives the whole experience an enjoyable one. Ohhh and the srirachos were perfect!

We have been here many times before and it was great. After we asked for the manager, we waited 25+ minutes for him to even come over. DO NOT come here if it's some what busy because you'll wait an hour for some sh***y wings and awful customer service. There are  many better, QUICKER options in VB.

As you try to eat healthier one thing I can appreciate is 33 different made from scratch flavors and their burgers are made from grass fed, 100% fresh ground chuck. I ordered the lemon pepper wings and jalapeno cheddar. I wasn't sure what to expect how the jalapeno cheddar wings would taste but I was please. I got blue cheese and celery which I have to say their blue cheese dressing was great.  I will return as they have different drink specials as well."}, {"review_id": "YYqLbY01WYSvDTw-DuCvmg", "user_id": "mBkxVHscXkdx278D_gCZDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Because wings are my favorite food I've tried a lot of wing places in Hampton roads and this so far is my 2nd favorite. Now we made the mistake of going on a playoffs night. (Won't make that mistake again.) So our service was not the greatest. But I'm not going to hold that against them because it was busy as hell. According to their menu they have all house made sauces and I wish I could remember the 3 I tried but we waited so long for our food. (40 mins) that I was too hangry to really think about anything. My friend had to remind me to take a picture. Lol anyway I like my wings extra crispy but on one of the flavors I ordered it's more of like a dry rub so it caused the wings to be a little too charred. So I probabaly won't get that one again. But the rest of my food was great! And other than those one wings they were cooked perfectly. Another thing I liked was they give you a choice of cucumbers rather than just celery and carrots. I love cucumbers so that was a nice surprise. Also the ranch was good which is important when it comes to wings. My boyfriend got the boneless which looks more like nuggets. But he enjoyed them. My only complaint, other than the wait for the food, was we ordered some fries which costs $3.99 and the little bucket was pretty small. Not really enough to share. All in all I'm excited to go back on a night where it's not so busy and try some different sauces."}, {"review_id": "EzAT8321p_98Y1fEYIJSxw", "user_id": "RonnUE7j6FHv5NhM67eHHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "They just put the calories on the menu...so sad now.
