A mirage. An oasis.    My friends... let me explain.  1.  Why does a middle eastern restaurant exist in the Dakotas at all? 2.  A buffet that costs more than a normal dinner usually tastes worse than a normal dinner.  A buffet that costs less than a normal dinner is sizzler or hometown buffet.   The buffet here cost less than a normal dinner elsewhere and was way better.  This is mathematically impossible.  3.  I've been to middle eastern restaurants all over the US and I've never tasted some of the flavors I had that night. Sanaa steps slightly away from the traditional and makes it better.  There was a soup I had that looked like kishik but tasted like a masterpiece.  It is the best soup I remember having in my life. 4.  One of her awesome older relatives sat down next to me and we talked Arabic about life and war and hard times and living in a foreign country.  He just mysteriously appeared and then left as if he was an oracle.  It was so wonderful. Math does not lie.  It must've all been a magical dream.  How lucky I  was to feel like I lived this dream."}, {"review_id": "Rn51mKE7OLH-rL7H3ZoqCw", "user_id": "a9BeICpdeVm4Lf1m20Z1kw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I would eat here every day of my life!

It was about time for lunch as we were approaching Sioux Falls. I wondered if we could actually find a vegan-friendly restaurant in the land of cows and meat-seeking patrons.Sure enough, we were lucky to find Sanaa's! What a great selection of Mediterranean food including a delicious hummus, a tangy cabbage salad, an amazing tabbouleh and a delicious cous cous with caramelized onions. I look forward to stopping here for lunch here again, en route to the Badlands!"}, {"review_id": "stdZuyAUAfWnASvCoz_2oA", "user_id": "3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/9/2016", "text": "Wow! What incredible Middle Eastern food! Flavorful, fresh and fast. Everything we tried was absolutely delicious and perfectly seasoned. We stopped by this unique space complete with bright, cheery yellow walls, vintage art and classic Middle Eastern lanterns hanging above for a weekday lunch. We decided to split the Mezze Sampler (hummus, tabouli, Baba Ganoush with pita bread), the soup of the day which was a big bowl of tomato based veggie and a spinach walnut fatayer which is basically a dough pocket with different kinds of fillings to choose from. The hummus was perfectly creamy and offered with or without a olive oil drizzle on top (great for the calorie conscious). The salads were all so incredible as was the fatayer which I was worried could have been a tad dry. It was certainly not although they did give me an extra sauce to accompany it. The mix of creamy spinach with the crunch of the walnut is a combination I'm found of. The soup was filling and hearty. The three of us splitting all of this still had leftovers as the portions were plentiful. Everyone was super sweet and helpful. They offered ordering suggestions and were so very kind. We saw Sanaa back there in the semi open kitchen cooking away and I ran into her sweet husband who was there dining with his friends. Everyone made us out-of-towners feel so welcome. If we lived in the area, we would most certainly be \"regulars\". The thought of this food being offered in a buffet has me drooling as that is how it's presented at night. This was a unexpected fantastic meal in the heart of Sioux Falls. We would definitely recommend Sanaa's and would put it on our list of \"go to\" places when in the area again."}, {"review_id": "3mJnNyih0SdzsI29QKj7TQ", "user_id": "fCc93_Bt7hcPRo4o1SUuxg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/24/2017", "text": "A nice little something-different restaurant in Sioux Falls. The lunch plate is a pretty good deal. I can't say it's the best I've ever had. I had the chicken plate w tabouleh salad. Chicken was tasty but nothing out of this world.

This place is incredible! I walked in here 30 mins before closing and luckily I was able to get some of their delicious options left. The tabouli and the hummus were top notch.

My favourite is Shish Tawook! It tastes amazing. I've now moved out of town and this is one of the biggest things I miss in town food wise. I think I need to figure out how to make my own Shish Tawook. The fresh hummus tastes great with a dash of olive oil. Service is usually very quick. Friendly staff. Sanaa is very nice and a great owner and manager. I get sick of the standard burger and fries; If you want to try something different and very tasty stop by. If you don't know what you'll like, ask and they're point you in the right direction.
