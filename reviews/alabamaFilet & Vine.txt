You pick-up your food from a cafeteria-style line that moves very fast, sometimes with the employees pushing you to make decisions too quickly. On my most recent visit, I got a boneless fried chicken breast, mac and cheese, green beans, and cornbread. The Mac and cheese and cornbread were excellent, but the green beans weren't great. The chicken was moist and tasty but they've definitely changed their provider of chickens in the past few years and the serving size was smaller. The restaurant also has a wine and beer shop with a wide-ranging selection. My major complaint about this place is the price. It's an expensive lunch option, especially for Alabama."}, {"review_id": "D6KE2rWitxUK9Z90eICZ-A", "user_id": "h7p-GuaHFGsiKCF4g6Bjqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I had had a long day of exploring Montgomery and I wanted to eat something delicious in bed in my hotel while watching terrible television. So I stopped by Filet & Vine. Filet & Vine is a wine/beer market and deli/sandwich shop. I grabbed some chicken salad, some crackers, a slice of cake, a chilled bottle of wine. Boy, did that hit the spot after a day of wandering around downtown Montgomery in that heat! Perfect ending to the day!"}, {"review_id": "KUg0YaMGKhn7ZTSJtmerZg", "user_id": "lxuqpIiRM48U61cLuUQ7Zw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/25/2017", "text": "Filet and Vine is a diamond in the rough!  I've been here numerous times this summer and I'll surely miss it as I venture my way back home to Colorado.  Filet and Vine is essentially a pretty awesome deli/bakery/liquor store/winery/southern buffet. Yes, all of those things in one.More often then not I end up ordering the bahn mi because let's be honest, it's freakin amazing. Essentially it's a grilled pork sandwich with a delicious slaw, pickle, and aoli that bring it all together. The ingredients are like a party in your mouth. It's so good I've found myself dreaming about it. I've also tried the Ruben which was good but it definitely wasn't the bahn mi. While you wait for your food your sure to be mesmerized by the assortment of beers, wines, and baked goods. I never got around to trying out the hot line but it features tasty looking southern favorites like fried chicken, cat fish, ribs, mac, cobblers, potatoes, etc. You should note that they usually close at 7 pm and they are closed on Sunday's. If you find yourself in the area and your looking for a delicious bite to eat, stop by, JUST DO IT!"}, {"review_id": "UAs4zMRnt6Q2IVV8TaS_1A", "user_id": "tere929rRn8ZyGwY-1TuDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "When I first arrived, it took a little while to be acknowledged and helped; however, this is understandable because I got there 20 minutes before they closed. My initial impression of the service was quickly changed once I was helped by a friendly staff member. While waiting for my banh mi sandwich, I browsed their enormous selection of craft beer.  I was having some trouble choosing a beer, but was quickly helped by an employee and offered a few samples to help me with my decision. When my sandwich was ready they called me up to the counter. As someone who loves sandwiches I can honestly say the banh mi sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I have had. I often find myself craving it whenever I am hungry. To top it off, everything was high quality and still reasonably priced. This place was amazing and I will definitely be going back and trying a different sandwich or the hot line."}, {"review_id": "aW4lVJLrkL3A9_Iv3cwtMA", "user_id": "CadPuvZlV4Sb9qVpUTL3uA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Excellent food and catering services.

Yes, you can find Spacedust IPA which once I saw I bought a 6 pack and handed to the people I drug with me to Filet & Vine. The next best part is the people, the employees don't take themselves too seriously and if you have some personality and make them laugh you will end up having a good time.The unfortunate part to Filet & Vine is that their food does not live up to the hype. Admittedly, I got there at 6 or so and I think they stop making fresh items at 530, but if they don't want me to review their food at 6 they shouldn't serve it at 6.Fried Chicken was dry and uninspiring, even if it was hot and fresh it lacked flavor. They had fried tilapia, more of the same and who the hell wants tilapia? Broccoli with cheese side was ok, corn side was actually pretty good and mac and cheese was nothing special. I don't know why every southern places recommends their mac and cheese like its amazing. Few places make mac and cheese special and filet & vine isn't one of them.If you want convenience type food made in batches with good beer or a made to order sandwich filet & vine is probably your best bet in Montgomery.... but that's not saying much."}, {"review_id": "mPUSh4UTtGEiMDL4fa7Kxw", "user_id": "yQT09Ej-B4GN2dtnxAZ0Cw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/31/2017", "text": "What a fun little find! Nestled in the adorable Cloverdale neighborhood, the outside is completely unassuming. The inside is exactly how a local market should be, full of friendly locals and delicious smells. I wish we had had lunch here, but we really only came for the local beer selection. My husband and I spent way too long just looking at all the beer options. They carry Avondale, Good People, and Trim Tab (we used to live in Birmingham and miss the local beer), but they also carry tons of other options from breweries we have never heard of, which is fantastic. So if you're in town and want a sandwich, good beer, a great wine selection, and a yummy hot bar- this is your place!"}, {"review_id": "IP6Z1f45w6C3zU8pCL4cDw", "user_id": "00ecV2fCEX37olxqkCfgCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "Nothing bad can be said about this place.

Overall very good but I will say I would have liked an option for dark meat. They only had these fried boneless breast pieces which weren't bad, I just love dark meat.  I would have liked the temp of my food to be a bit hotter as well, kinda was lukewarm even when I first sat down. They have a great range of options for sides and sandwiches and other dishes like fried fish that looked really delicious so if you go I'm sure you will have no problem finding something you like. Also they had a really nice selection of beers to buy as well as some of the dishes they make sitting in a freezer for purchase.
