I cannot overstate how fabulous this restaurant is. I have never been disappointed my experience here. They have really great omelettes. I usually make my own, and I love all the options. I would also highly suggest the cinnamon toast!If you are going to here on a weekend, I would plan extra time though because there is usually a long wait. However, they have a nice waiting room and theres an all you can drink complimentary coffee bar. They have lots of great flavors of coffee too. I love the coconut and vanilla coffee flavors. Another thing I love about Cafe Patachou is all the diet friendly options. They have really healthy options and even vegan friendly options. I would highly suggest this place to anyone looking for a fun brunch!!"}, {"review_id": "RG8MY1MXAsTY-22AoDfyaw", "user_id": "EYByq2_hEjTwlIZZgleIkQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Rounding out one of the most disappointing weekends in downtown Indianapolis - breakfast at Cafe Patachou. Pro:Short wait for two people. Coffee bar. Cute setting. Aesthetically pleasing.  Price was okay. Con: A grumpy waitress who didn't smile once. Cramped seating. Flavorless breakfast potatoes that weren't completely cooked. A runny inside on an omelet. Apple fritter French toast... shudder...ew. Burned edges, hard and dry, sand like consistency, no apples. It was so sad. Choked down 3 bites. Can't recommend."}, {"review_id": "CbyUCUndyDOGP4qCycMfeQ", "user_id": "eaRPVRp5AndzvvngFrNgWg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Three stars, that is all I can give this place. I have heard wonderful remarks about Cafe Patachou, but I didn't have a great experience. I came here on a Friday morning for a working breakfast with six people. We were quickly seated and told about the coffee bar. I go to restaurants to be served. If I wanted to get up for refill then I would have gone to McDonalds. Ugh. Even Chick-fil-A brings you out refills of coffee. The menu is not thrilling. A lot of breakfast items with salads. I couldn't find breakfast potatoes anywhere. Maybe I missed them. I ordered a bacon sandwich with a runny egg and cheese. The food arrived and it looked okay. The bacon was great. The sourdough bread was okay and the cheese must have been missing. The salad taste dirty. Hard to explain, but sometimes greens taste dirty and these did. Wasn't impressed at all.I tried my friend's cinnamon bread and was surprised to see it was the same bread I made as the kid. I'm sure it is the same bread inmates make in prison. Literally nothing special. I was a fat kid and would make both sides cinnamon so I actually prefer my own style...After we finished, we paid and were rushed out. They started to give us dirty looks to leave. It was crazy. We all overtip, but the waiter couldn't wait to have us out. Don't come here for a meeting. They don't want that at this establishment. In the menu it says to tell a human if you have an issue. Sadly, I was rushed out before I could tell management so they will have to settle for this review. I don't see why anyone would come here. Food isn't great, service is spotty and parking is awful."}, {"review_id": "bCl_lVTsdiRTxeBOA1gwYQ", "user_id": "qXrGkk7F7dJvBuYrNJ7JGg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "We were traveling to visit a friend in Indy and this place came highly recommended. We were greatly disappointed. This place is missing it's heart. The menu looked amazing. The waiter looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there with us doing his job. I ordered the vegan Cuban Breakfast and the menu says (copied and pasted)Seasoned black beans and rice, hard tofu crumbles, avocado, chopped greens, vegan spinach-jalapeño pesto - 9.95Mine was a sad bowl of greens with black beans and rice, a few slices of avocado, and COLD tofu. So disappointed. I would have sent it back but the waiter didn't come back for the entirety of the meal and only to bring the check not even bothering to ask how everything was. The highlight was the jalapeño pesto sauce and the self service coffee mostly because if I would have relied on the service here I wouldn't have had much coffee. Don't waste your time or your good hard money here. I like to eat out where people care and the food has heart."}, {"review_id": "z7m5ZfctWGq3kNZTQfYn6A", "user_id": "g_Y88iSiJ39CTd_x1k6rjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Patachou knows the secret to offering healthy options and great taste. We had breakfast 2 days in a row for our out of town guests. So many great options including vegetarian, granola and daily omelette specials which started around $12. I loved the side of fresh greens with my omelette. I tried a sausage and veggies omelette and a avocado and pepper omelette.  Both were tasty especially the creamy avocado. The service was fabulous. Drew checked on us regularly and connected with our granddaughter, bringing crayons and playing with her. Great customer service. I love how the serving team works together to deliver meals to the table in concert. Everyone got their meals at the same time.  Love the concept of the coffee bar. Everyone could take care of themselves. Also they custom make chai and other favorites.  The breads are incredible. I loved the multigrain bread. So nutty and flavorful richly buttered. Yum. The muffins also looked incredible.  The granola options were huge. My daughter had the croissant French toast, which was caramelized and sweetly delicious. Omg.  The restaurant is convenient to many downtown Indy hotels and offices and is a must stop for delicious breakfast or lunch."}, {"review_id": "qvoEd1tV97YcpGO6psWtqg", "user_id": "kSXXuxO6CxpyGvJsEute8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Portions are perfect size. Cuban Breakfast- the perfect portion and quantity of each part of the place. Recommend adding chorizo to complete the dish.

The candies pecan topping on the French toast is the perfect addition along with the pure maple syrup. Comes with a side of fruit, but substituted bacon for no additional charge.Highly recommend pairing both dishes with the house Bloody Mary!"}, {"review_id": "DKrqSKBkXBDiPsbnx_4cXg", "user_id": "pJDiwolkcQfBPW7-XaMWHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Delicious coffee!

The last time \"dining\" with Patachou, I had pick-up on the morning of my brothers wedding. I ordered THE OMELETTE YOU CAN'T REFUSE. Well contrary to its name, it was REALLY EASY TO REFUSE. Why...do you ask. There was a DEAD FLY sitting right on top of my omelet. Yes, you read that correctly.... A DEAD FLY. We called and they offered to make a new one and we went and picked it up. I was honestly so disgusted that I barely ate any and it was cold.I don't know why I keep going back to Patachou.... I've had many good experiences, but after this last one I won't be going back. I think they get a lot of traffic from all the hotels around them but honestly after the dead fly incident, I can't picture them as quality brunch food anymore."}, {"review_id": "TWsUrXbe391hnHMJN4R5gw", "user_id": "TFWTfVAIWn25I_t3qYWA2A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Brunch is my favorite meal of the day especially with friends. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was busy. Parking can be tricky depending on the day, time and events downtown. There is a separate waiting area. We were seated within 20 minutes. I was really excited about the self-serve coffee bar and options. Our waitress was vegan so it was a match made in heaven. Unfortunately the food was not. I ordered the Vegan Cuban Breakfast substituting the tofu for field roast and added potatoes. Also I did a side order of bread and jelly- amazingly good. I had high hopes for my dish but the cooks completely overcooked the field roast and the potatoes. The customer service was great, it's a trendy spot. I just wish the vegan food matched."}, {"review_id": "b4FYzG3ff74Ad5U7suip6Q", "user_id": "3OmR5QGQUpbqhNj7gkuGNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "It really wouldn't be possible for me to overhype Patachou. I've been to several of their locations and am never disappointed--service, ambiance, food are always on point. From sweet to savory, healthy to decadent, everything in the menu tastes fresh and delicious. The menu seems to be fairly consistent between the various locations so if one is more convenient for you on any particular day, you still know that you'll be able to get your favorites...From omlettes to broken yolk sandwiches, and French toast to my favorite scratchmade granola--served in a generous portion, filled with delicious dried cherries. The staff is always amazing....on our most recent visit our server noticed that our little one was getting antsy and surprised her with paper and a handful of crayons. So sweet!

Stepped in--the decor is really modern and hip, the host who greeted us was very friendly and our wait wasn't very long at all (10-15 min). We would've sat outside on the patio if it hadn't been so chilly though! I ordered the roasted turkey sandwich paired with arugula salad and the tomato artichoke soup combination. The shining star of this meal was the soup--it was very freshly made, perfect temperature and the texture was a little thicker than most tomato soups I've had (which I prefer). The croutons and bit of cheese on top was the perfect finishing touch! The sandwich was decent but a little dry, and the salad was basically arugula coated in a light vinaigrette. My friend ordered an omelette paired with their famous cinnamon spread toast. That cinnamon spread is amazing! They gave four halves of toasted bread coated in this yummy goodness as a side to the omelette and we both couldn't get enough."}, {"review_id": "_fiTXcUdf6dNpSuqAg02Sw", "user_id": "7td-LQ3bMqMFAmrxhtQfHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Hands down the best place you can go for breakfast/lunch in Indianapolis.

Cafe Patachou has a fun, refreshing environment. They are very allergen and vegan friendly. My cousin got the gluten free waffle and was in heaven! I've gotten the same meal each time, The Cuban Breakfast with sausage or chorizo for an add on. This place has a large list of hot, cold and alcoholic drinks. My boyfriend typically gets a new meal each time with a Bloody Mary. He said he felt the Bloody Mary recipe may have changed since the last time we went, but that it was delicious both times!  I'm not a huge coffee person, but people seem to love the serve yourself coffee bar.

That is the way to go, no crowds, quick seating, friendly service and great food. Yay... The food quality is excellent. I ordered the Bon Vivant omelette with the arugula and of course cinnamon toast... BTW the cinnamon toast is an absolute MUST, you just gotta try it. But beware, you will be hooked. I have no idea how they do this, but the darn toast is just sooo freakin' good. Main focus though was my omelette which lists ham, cheese, onions and whole grain mustard... what it doesn't say is that the mustard is mixed into the egg itself, so that gives an interesting flavor to the entire omelette. Not bad, but it does need a little getting used to though. A bit more flavoring on the arugula would be phenomenal.Anyway... the reasons for the lack of a fifth star:First: I don't really like traipsing through the entire restaurant every time I need a refill. When you dine by yourself, should you take all your stuff with you and test your balancing  talents, or leave it at your seat and hope it's still there when you return? Secondly: I really don't need to listen to the wait staffs weekend adventures, plans, lame jokes, innuendos and watch their little wrestling games, can you be bored a little less loud? Do I really want your hands in or near my food when they were just in your co-workers hair and face or on their behind?"}, {"review_id": "yVfRoIjgbzljh8HthKFp1g", "user_id": "ELAfGVuGSdF_F5ZAjScmuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "I liked the atmosphere.

They also had a stand where you can serve your own hot coffee instead of having the servers bring it to you. I had the Ora King smoked salmon broken yolk. It was fresh salmon on toast with an egg on top with a side of argula. It was good, but i felt as if it tasted kinda bland. It did fill me up. Definitely on the pricier side though.
