Came here at noon on a Saturday and there was live music- a dude playing guitar, it was really nice ! It was pretty packed and the whole place smelled like fresh baked cookies since they just came out of the oven. Omg I got three big chocolate chip cookies and had to eat one while it was hot. Absolutely amazing. They had a lot of coffee flavors- I got hazelnut and was delighted to see they had almond milk with the creams and milks. The coffee was super amazing! On the coffee cup it said they were one of the 51 best coffees in the nation and I believe it! I ordered the Mikey T- chicken cutlet, arugula, tomato, mozzarella, and pesto mayo on a wedge. The bread had a nice crusty outside and soft inside. The chicken cutlet was cooked perfectly and the flavors were spectacular. Seriously everything about this place from the food to the service was incredible. The prices are super reasonable too.  We chose to eat out side since it was considerably warm for February, and it was pretty loud inside. From the looks of it, it slowed down a lot by the time we finished our meal around 1pm. I will be back for sure ! MUST TRY !!"}, {"review_id": "W3_R9WSHKFLlpgdkV90DNg", "user_id": "0_f-r5bEC_qfK3VRQkDPbg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I concur with some of these posts.  I gave 3 stars as the benefit of the doubt because the food is good, but the wait times are soooooo long, even for simple orders.  I went there with my brother, each ordered a sandwich, took over 45 minutes and it wasn't that crowded.  The presentation is nice and the restaurant is right in the neighborhood so it's pleasant if you want to just hang out.  But when I get there I want to eat, which I why haven't been back in a while because of the slow service"}, {"review_id": "P75lT2SVbBImgyIK8QUICg", "user_id": "Z_aZzNx1K6HUvwR6kD2A7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/24/2017", "text": "I have to say I honestly wasn't expecting this spot to be so delicious.

You can stop in and have breakfast or lunch and you will not be disappointed. This is my spot to enjoy a good original Cuban sandwich. Although the options are plentiful the Cuban is what I order. Also if you time it correctly you can get a freshly made chocolate chip cookie which is to die for. I am glad I purchased 3 for $2.50, I literally could have just kept eating them. The staff is quick and friendly and although it may be packed while you are ordering  you will find a seat to have your meal. I highly recommend this place.."}, {"review_id": "k4uyRKbPb0jBDWc5JnZOUA", "user_id": "PSFp4GzCzv5_chXYXmh-Hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "A local gem.

Fantastic atmosphere both inside and out, perfect place to take set up with your laptop or meet up with friends. The food is fantastic. I am a vegetarian and often find it difficult to get a good breakfast sandwich but their \"Son if a beach\" was to die for. The owner/manager is extremely friendly- I went back inside after finishing my breakfast to try some of the chocolate raspberry coffee everyone has been raving about. They were out, and as I was looking at the coffees deciding whether or not to try another flavor, he asked me what I was looking for. When I told him I had come in for the chocolate raspberry coffee, he had the staff make a fresh batch which was ready in about 5 minutes.  The coffee was definitely worth the wait.

It is a place you want to visit again and again. It feels like home. No frills. The chef will walk around asking you how everything is and taking pictures even. The great coffee. I simply love the place and the vibe. All this makes you almost forget the simplicity of the choices of food. I don't mean simple in a good way. The food is ok. Few choices for us vegetarians. Hash browns is a must try. The croissants are killer. I suggest try each one of the different fillings. The cookies are like yum!!! Sunday afternoon is like a fish market. No wonder they call it a market. Coze that day it is a market indeed. Wait time is an hour long with little or no air conditioning on a hot day. I changed my table 4 times to find a spot where I could find little air to be able to eat my food. Definitely going back for more. I really wish they ran Sunday specials or something for repeat customers."}, {"review_id": "NCtyLuc9iHyaI6tlbVJcDQ", "user_id": "pxnm3yhL20lFfILrib4v8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2017", "text": "This place is a local hotspot that is nearly always full. Not to worry though, their service is very quick and friendly and there is usually little to no line for ordering. Harborview has great breakfast food, and the breakfast sandwiches are a hit. The cranberry muffins are to die for and the freshly made orange juice is delicious. There is outdoor seating and occasionally some local bands will play in the restaurant.

That's true blue New England attitude that I love.  Because of that I bought one and some cookies.... I also give kudos for the food....pretty damn decent and outstanding coffee (any place that proudly serves Stumptown coffee is awesome in my book).  The problem here is the inefficient wait and cook times (and look, I wasn't ordering anything complicated....like crab cakes or filet mignon) for simple breakfast sandwiches and burritos with eggs.  Just a breakfast sandwich, and two breakfast burritos.....how difficult can that be?  Over an hour later we finally got our food and had to get it to go or we would have missed our train back home to VA.  So here's some constructive suggestions......you have all of this massive space in the back that is a kitchen that you are using to make pastries with only ONE guy back there.....totally get it that you need more room for that due to dough rising, blah blah blah......and you have this mini kitchen smack dab in the middle with ONE line cook for food.....REVERSE that.....the draw to this place is the pastries...put that up front where the smells draw hungry customers in, put the kitchen in the back so you have more room for more cooks......ALL of your customers there this morning were ordering food.....and all were waiting....this was a kitchen inefficient nightmare!  Poor chap that was helping us get our food moved along was totally also frustrated.  I walked around and totally saw how massively inefficient the setup was.....Also...for the love of all that is holy, come up with some other way of getting food to people....to have a lady running around screaming a names at the top of her voice (inside and out) was just unnerving (especially since it was hard to understand what name she was actually saying) the other poor chap that was doing it then  didn't speak loud enough......For crying out loud get cones with numbers or something so you aren't wasting time having someone running around yelling names, and you can put more time into the cook line.....good lord....perhaps then you would reduce wait time for basic breakfast sandwiches to 30 minutes, instead of over 60.  All in all I give it 3 stars but only for the coffee, pastries, ambience, and pastry chef with the attitude.....other than that, I won't NOT go here if you have someplace to be until they rework their efficiencies.......I could just imagine Chef Ramsay visiting this place...he would be beside himself!!!!"}, {"review_id": "vRrN7k4MAFAP-gXYwTstMg", "user_id": "YtdRyoL-ixeN6aNetnRdiA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2017", "text": "Great atmosphere.

I liken it to a little bit of Portland, OR in Bridgeport. It's on a side street off Fairfield Ave, so it's tucked away means there's not a lot of noisy cars, no trucks and no exhaust fumes as you enjoy your croissant outside on their sun-drenched patio with your paper and your dog sitting next to you. Rick bakes delicious croissants and Michelle makes famous chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies. Huge and soft inside, crunchy edges and baked fresh throughout the day, you can find them still warm from the oven and sitting on their baking tray- a true treat.It's a modern day \"Cheers\". Everyone knows each other and everyone is friendly. That's staff and patrons. Babies come in their PJ's and the owner walks around talking to everyone he's a great guy as is his wife who does catering and does a nice job. There is a salad bar and a hot food lunch bar. The griddle serves eggs, panckes and a variety of sandwiches, all good. Grab a newspaper from one of the many community tables ( no private seats- one of the best things about it) and someone is going to come say hi to you if you don't get there first.   Live music on Sunday's. Biggest tip: Do Not Go On Sundays. You'll wait over an hour for your order- maybe even 1 1/2 hours.  The regular cook, Antonio is off that day. Go on Saturday if The Weekend is the only time you can go.They are very active participants in the community and we all love them."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/harborview-market-bridgeport?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
