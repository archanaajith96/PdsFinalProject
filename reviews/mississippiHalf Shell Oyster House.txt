They have a bar where the oyesters are prepared.  It's a fun place to sit and gorge."}, {"review_id": "4jdWx_J40MWUnW1hBe_qow", "user_id": "J3vRlkMVlnB6lujQY8Hgpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Half Shell has to be one of the most amazing restaurants I've been to in a very long time.

The Half Shell upholds a very New Orleanian theme; the paintings, decor, and food all symbolise landmarks from the city. Their wine, liquor, and beer selection is also very appealing. And, of course, quality raw oysters at a respectable price. On to the improvements. Their Seafood Platter entree is pathetic. For $26 you'd expect a sizeable portion, but this wasn't the case. The menu does specify the amount of chargrilled oysters and shrimp you will be recieving; at three and five, respectively, that's perfectly fine. Granted, the fish and crab cake were paltry. Three small bites, maybe (if you're eating with a toddler's utensils). I refuse to rate the Half Shell lower than four stars because it is truly very good. Next time I will be sure to choose an alternative for my entree."}, {"review_id": "1U1LCpo9v0xA8AGHdWP4fw", "user_id": "lBrS5Ij5knkmu9Wfy2bZTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "The Cajun oysters are the best. Just as good if not better than New Orleans. Quaint, brick building. Awesome server named Chelsea I believe?We had four martinis. Not one of them were filled. This just looks bad. Like we were served a half drank martini. Add ice or buy smaller martini glasses. When we were done w dinner we had time to kill. We went downstairs and sat at the bar. Big mistake because the girl clearly had no desire to wait on us or make drinks. We were 2 of 3 people at the bar. Five minutes passed. No words like \"be right with you\". She left the bar. When she finally came back, I didn't even want a drink anymore. My husband ordered a drink. She disappeared again and we had another staff member bring our bill. We had a lot of time to kill so this place lost out on our money. And she lost out on generous tippers. Would I go back? Absolutely.

Girlfriend had grouper and it was good but sever didn't get the sides right and never did take care of it. I guess I would recommend eating there I just hope you get a different sever.

We were temporarily located here for about 6 months back in 2010 and this was a place we frequented. We were in the area and decided to stop by to see if it was as good as we remembered. All I remember was that we always ordered the oysters Rockefeller.We ordered that but I saw the oysters bienville and said we should do half Rockefeller and half bienville, so we were the crazy table chasing after our serve, Steven, to tell him we wanted to change. Excellent decision. Hubby got the Filet New Orleans with the sweet potato creme brûlée and asparagus. He said he was gonna get the sweet potato creme brûlée and I made a disgusted face and said that sounds disgusting. Boy was I wrong. It obviously was fantastic. The asparagus had gorgonzola cheese on it and they were cooked perfectly. Now onto the Steven was great, very patient and he handled my indecisiveness. I ended up changing my mind a few times, but finally settled on crab cakes half shell with a cup of the lobster, crab and corn bisque. I loved my crab cakes but would try the gumbo next time. The soup wasn't that great.Can't wait until we have another cross country road trip.

I'm not an oyster person so I tried other options. For a starter the blue crab claws were delicious with the coctail sauce.  The Seafood Stuffed Portabellos were absolutely amazing. Stuffed to the max with filling and an absolutely delicious sauce to top it off.  A huge portion.  The gumbo is delicious and a bowl is very filling with a side of garden salad.

The Voodoo shrimp are also winners for an appetizer. If you like fish, I would recommend the Redfish with lemon aioli. And if you LOVE seafood I would order the pasta.

Luckily we were able to sit at one of their 3 bars and watch part of the parade through the window while enjoying our food. We shared a fried green tomatoes and crab app. Both the crab cakes and tomatoes were lightly battered -- 3 of each alternating on the plate topped with lots of lemony dressing. Yum.Then I had a dozen combo oysters. As I can't have spinach, they nicely subbed the Rockefellers for 4 each of the others... so I had 4 charbroiled (wine, butter, garlic, herb sauce); 4 Orleans (slightly spicy; charbroiled with a Cajun sauce), and 4 bienville (with shrimp, crab, mushrooms, bacon topped with Parmesan cheese).Double yum.
