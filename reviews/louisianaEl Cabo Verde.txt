They bring you warmed Verde and red salsa both of which are delicious. I ordered Verde enchiladas and unsweetened iced tea, one of the enchiladas was chicken and the other I'm guessing was some sort of cheese with sides of rice and beans.    The food was served hot and in a timely manner i, all items on the plate was delicious. Fresh and hot very flavorful. The only problem I had was with the service. The waitress checked on me about 2 minutes after she brought my food and I didn't see her again until I was through eating. Iced tea $2.50 with no refill. 5 Stars for the food. I will definitely be back at this restaurant soon."}, {"review_id": "6JZSLkz__8XvTDig1UNgVA", "user_id": "vFixv2tBjF9x01GfoiLZNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "This has probably been the best meal I have had in a long time....from the atmosphere to the service and definitely the food! Found this small modern little Mexican food place on Yelp and most certainly glad we did! The atmosphere is bright, clean and welcoming. The staff (hosts, management, and especially the waitstaff) were friendly, hospitable, and very knowledgeable of the entire menu. I forgot the name of our waiter but he made excellent recommendations and was very prompt and made us feel like we were friends or family not just \"a tip\". And don't get me started on this menu!! FIRST AND FOREMOST everything here is gluten free! Second and most importantly: the ingredients used are all organic and locally sourced! The freshest, finest, most quality ingredients used to prepare these amazing dishes! The quest was delicious, pulled pork was outstanding and the tamales were superb. I don't think there was a single thing that we ordered that we did not like 110%. Seriously. Where else can you get food that you literally have no complaints about whatsoever?? Sangria was perfect (and I make the best sangria...just sayin) andddd the worlds biggest Mojito critic (yep, me...the girl who has only had 4 perfect Mojitos in her life) HIGHLY APPROVES of the ones I had here....where my waiter went outside and PICKED THE FRESH MINT FOR THE MOJITOS!!!!! AMAZING!!!!! I am in absolute love of this establishment and the entire team behind it! The owner Gabriel has done a FANTASTIC JOB creating the perfect spot for some pretty incredible food and drinks. Will most definitely absolutely be back. And you can bet your sweet ass I'm telling anyone and everyone about my experience here tonight. I can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu!!!!"}, {"review_id": "XB50nfVFaVLYfMHOqHarpw", "user_id": "YGMQfOC99Wyyq16OE6UecQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I love EVERYTHING about this Mexican restaurant.  First, the food tasted as if it were made in Mexico City; I inquired, and it turns out the chef is from a small town outside that area - hence, the food is AUTHENTIC!  Their philosophy is only fresh, real food.  Their servers area knowledgeable and provide great drink/food recommendations (thanks Eli).  Great prices, decor, freshly made chips & tortillas, and my favorite - WARM SALSA!  Try a margarita flask when you go - may I recommend the jalapeno margarita (seeds are removed, you get the flavor without the heat)."}, {"review_id": "X-sBWeCOQX21XLwdA8VFdw", "user_id": "Z2mf_9_N7RFq7n-vabxmVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Ate here for the first time the other day.  Awesome!  Love it!  Absolutely will be back!  Fresh food, terrific taste, great atmosphere, excellent staff.  & the owner is the absolute best.  5 stars easy!"}, {"review_id": "Nyxoe5CBENOO_W2Cd8aQZw", "user_id": "K5sEuK5055nwvsGENc3cow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "This place is insanely good!!!! So glad we gave it a try. We had the sweetest waitress, Maria. I went with my boyfriend, and we both ordered tacos. We also split their margarita flight. All around delicious--including the two warm salsas and chips they served! The shrimp tacos that I ordered had well balanced flavor and were so fresh. The homemade tortillas made the dish top notch. Also, the beans and rice were soooo good. Normally restaurant side dishes are just an after thought, but these were amazing. Definitely go check this place out!

My meal was fresh & wholesome.  Particularly authentic in comparison to lackluster local mexican fare.  However, for the price charged, it was par on value.I did avail myself of a dozen corn tortillas, used to make homemade fish tacos.  $5 a dozen is expensive, but you can't have the flavor of home (in this town) without paying for it.  I'm just pleased they're finally available to me.Wishing you well, thanks for improving the food prospects of Shreveport."}, {"review_id": "UD7GRTDhx281YwbCYn1k8w", "user_id": "ePaMlPAO6VQIC99r6sAx0Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/17/2017", "text": "Our church group made the Tuesday night journey to the outer edge of town to try a \"new\" to us Mexican restaurant. With a variety of Mexican restaurants sprinkled across town with styles varying from Tex-Mex to the more traditional Mexican fare, El Cabo Verde seemed like an exciting food expedition.Small, but stylish, the restaurant filled quickly on a Tuesday night. It appeared the manager took over our group as well as others as the two other wait staff hustled to keep up with a full house of hungry folks inside as well as on the front patio. Service was slow but persistent due to the crowd size. The lack of local restaurants and beautiful weather may have added to the large crowd size.As for the food, I can only say that it was fresh and reminds me of mid-western cooking, not too spicy , not too Mexican.  The table agreed the beef tacos were filled with  very tasty chunks of pot roast and excellent tasting dollops of guacamole. Being used to mesquite seared beef, I was a tad disappointed. The rice was white and the refried beans were brown, and were  in keeping with the mid-western theme of not too spicy. Portions were ample, prices reasonable.Beer was served cold and \"house\" margaritas were offered \"on the rocks\". Margaritas were tasty--not too sour or too strong as to prevent a sober drive back to town.The high point of dinner was the tortilla soup that my wife raved about on the trip back home. When the craving for a light dinner of soup and margaritas hits , we will return. As for something to quell that \"Got to have Mexican food\" craving, we will most likely stick closer to home. I'm thinking this restaurant will most likely attract folks from the surrounding neighborhoods who want a filling meal and a cold drink after work. At that, they will excel."}, {"review_id": "Xb2HaYYsFqwdZwyvOE4dXQ", "user_id": "Wmm6C30HF2A45EIp4P-z4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2017", "text": "We came here from Houston and wanted to grab a bite before heading back and saw this place on yelp and it had 6 stars.

I mean nobody makes tacos like these around here! I absolutely LOVE that they use local, organic ingredients. When I heard Gabriel was opening a restaurant, that was probably the longest wait of my life! So I finally got the time to come check it out last night with one of my good friends! The location is very nice, upscale, with an open view of the kitchen. We got seated immediately, & served chips, & salsa. We started with the guacamole, & queso which are both incredibly delicious! I ordered the Veggie Tacos, & as per usual, they are just bursting with flavor! Of course, I didn't expect anything less! I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for something other than your typical Mexican restaurant!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-cabo-verde-shreveport?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
