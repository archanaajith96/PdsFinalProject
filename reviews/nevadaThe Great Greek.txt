Looking for something to eat. came across this place online. Through yelp. On our way to our hotel in Lake Las Vegas. We called and placed a pick up order. Not knowing what to expect. Hoping that it will be decent at least. We ordered the chicken kabob, rice and salad. The portions were large. Salad was placed in a separate container. Which kept it crispy and fresh. Chicken was tender and so good. Overall so pleased by the results. We took a chance and so happy we did. They had my order ready and they even made me my own personal dressing for the chicken. Loved loved the food. Thank you for not disappointing. We will definitely return once we come back in town. Only negative thing I have to say was. Google maps has a different directions then where it was actually located. But wasn't hard to figure  out the mistake once we arrived. But yet confusing especially from a non local."}, {"review_id": "aUMPoNxI05g3kbI3vf-6_g", "user_id": "LKe5xYLVQ08rhBRIww-YZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "One of the better Greek/Kabob places on this side of town. Everyone is always friendly. Place is always clean and they are working FAST to get you your order.Their lamb gyro is good and on par with most other gyros I've had. Their fries are normal fries. Nothing super special. I'm used to krinkle cut(which I love) fries at Greek places usually, though. The salad was super fresh, but needed a little more dressing (maybe on the side, as not everyone would agree with me). All in all, I am here once or twice a month cuz I live in the area, but I wouldn't drive across town for it."}, {"review_id": "Vx6YqWiuIaUSqRgW770x8g", "user_id": "HdQThDk5rAT33A9i4q61RA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Great people, great food, This place does it Right!We usually stop in here every time we come through the area. It's always a very comfortable and casual atmosphere. The staff are the most happy and relaxed group and always smiling and helpful. To me that really adds to the mood of the restaurant. We have a toddler and they are always super friendly to the baby and accommodating. The food is delicious and well priced. We have eaten here several times and tried several dishes. They are all very good and worth your time. We found the great Greek by searching for something outside of Vegas because we don't really want to fight the traffic or the crowd just to eat. This place is easy to find, easy to get to, lots of parking, no wait, fast service and even a patio. So If your just in the area or looking for something good outside of Vegas this is a must try!"}, {"review_id": "lFY82Zg_oIvrt7KER9IExQ", "user_id": "lyfYBqtDGJJ1c98pfLUcLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "First timers, I ordered the garlic shrimp with rice plate it was delicious and more then filling.

It is creamy Greek feta with spicy roasted peppers and it is amazing! I seriously dream about this dip.My Husband loves Greek food, so it doesn't take much convincing to get him to take me to dinner here. We traditionally get the gyro plate, which comes with sliced gyro meat, pita bread and your choice of french fries or rice pilaf. I usually get the rice because it's a healthier option and it's very well made.The restaurant is small and gets crowded. There is no table service - you order at the counter and they will bring your food to you when it's ready. The gyro plate is just $11.95, which is a much better value than many of the other local Greek places we've been to, and in my opinion this food is better. They've been around for a long time, so I'd say they're doing something right!"}, {"review_id": "EV1G6o7buQFBgd7_rcULWA", "user_id": "bh1yWiSTac9blS9MaQRJEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Great food and friendly service.

The good thing was that the service was quick and the food came promptly. They have inside and outside seating which is pretty nice when there's nice weather. My husband ordered the great Greek gyro. He ordered it as a combo and it included a drink with a side. He picked the feta fries and they were good. He also said he really liked the gyro. It looked full of lamb and yummy! I ordered a plate with rice, lamb and pita bread. The portion was big and there was food left on my plate when I finished eating. I thought the food was very flavorful and fresh. We also ordered the dolmas as appetizers and they were pretty good! There were 6 pieces in our order which I think it was more than enough for two people. I do wish they offered a 4 piece for 2 people since we ended up not eating all of them. I would definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "nhfOAFFs34IzaSWrFoNO0g", "user_id": "hKbKOL2E6KN_YUCfYP4AEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Delicious, reasonably priced Greek food.

If you love Greek food, raise your hands. If you love feta! You have reached my favorite Greek Food Location in Henderson. Not only do they offer great food, they also sale beer! I had the absolute pleasure of trying, The Grilled Chicken Souvlaki! I have now idea how to say Souvlaki, but it's amazing! For $12.95 you get two skewers of Marinated Chicken Breast, rice Pilaf or Feta Fries! Yes Feta Fries can you believe it!! check the photo out, they are in no way cheap on the Feta! My entire order came out hot, and ready to eat, the restaurant and it's service second to none. When the suns out you can eat outside or inside either or!  Other great items to try, warm pits bread and hummus $2.00 and Falefel $2.50.. gyros run, chicken $6.95 enjoy all and don't forget the gum after or the mints!! Garlic is life here! Yummmm"}, {"review_id": "rrK_hXya6GjedThGgn1jPg", "user_id": "EtQ9WxYfl6w4kYWbCdyVgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Great place to eat Gyro.
