We just went to the new bigger location just a few doors down, and left a little disappointed. One of our favorite things about their food, that made them stand out from the rest, was the marinara sauce. They used to make this fresh pretty much everyday and it's no longer the same sauce anymore. The old sauce was amazing, and I'm sad to see it no longer being served.The new marinara is not nearly as flavorful. The cheesy garlic bread is good but not the same without the older sauce. Same for the pizza, good crust but not as flavorful.The food is still pretty good and if you didn't have their previous sauce you won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "O46zfyDCMfBtDT5kpBqNEg", "user_id": "pEpLQcXABlFga1tteI2B2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Omg. I don't even know where to start. Well I do. My first experience here was actually second hand. My BF went down here to grab a to-go-menu. (We're new to the neighborhood and saw great reviews). The owner didn't have any, HOWEVER, he offered free garlic knots to take home instead. When I got home from school, three were left for me to eat. OMG what deliciousness. Score! So we decide a few weeks later to come down and give this place a try. (Side note, I do make my decisions about where I eat mainly on how I get treated... I'll always give places more chances if they're nice). With that being said, we walked in and immediately were greeted by the owner. He recognized my boyfriend from a few weeks ago which is A+ in my book! We sat in a booth and were approached by a waiter. He was so kind and quick! Took our beer order and brought us more garlic knots on the house! YASSSSSSS! We asked a few questions about the items, and like the fattys that we are, we ordered a pizza, an entree, and of course... dessert. I ordered the chicken parmigiana. (Spelling?) OMG CAN YOU SAY HEAVEN ON A PLATE? The serving was huge! The chicken had an amazing layer of melted cheese on top, and the sauce was delicious. It definitely did not disappoint! My BF ordered a half white half red pizza. DROOOOOOOL that pizza was by far, THE MOST AMAZING PIZZA IN THE WORLD. My Bf loved it. I personally like the white more because it was so different from all other pizzas I've tasted. But both of them were out of this world. Service was still great; and the owner walked around and came to every table to make sure everything was good. Thats the kind of welcoming, family environment I look for. Now, onto the cannolis. They tasted like Home made! With frank Sinatra playing in the background, I honestly god teary eyed. I couldn't stop smiling. The food, the family like environment, the New York signs and photos of amazing actors... I cried tears of joy. And no I'm not exaggerating. You HAVE to come here. On our first try they've gained life long customers. Can not recommend this place enough. Thank you so much for such an amazing evening."}, {"review_id": "DbAroSROhxFN--t2332guQ", "user_id": "IK2Km4kgvUMz77dT7YbX2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I'm giving the Casanova Brothers a 5 star, my first ever meal was take out pizza, fries and garlic knots.

 Good food and a good game.  Made my day.  And the owner is such a gentleman-- we got free garlic knots and zepole!  Loved everything.  Love the new location.  This is a 5 star operation.  Come by.  You won't be sorry.  Tell them Yvonne sent you!"}, {"review_id": "hweua2rbFkYlLtFox6Rtqg", "user_id": "AEaQGWCD4hL4QIv2oAHkBw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "We were in the lot grabbing a new washer and remembered we'd been in before and wanted to come back. We finally made it back. They've moved location but only to just across the way. The new location feels a little less intimate than the previous one however, it also feels bigger and more open. I also like the decor of photographs and the Italian feel the whole place has. The hostess was awesome! She greeted us and let us take a seat at the bar. It was bit later in the afternoon when we arrived and figured we'd have a beer while we waited for our pizzas. As I said, we figured we'd have a beer... We'd have a beer.... We'd have a beer, if there were anyone behind the bar or anyone who asked us if we wanted a beer. A bit frustrating as the man was thirsty and just wanted a beer. Even just a water would have worked for me until that beer could be ordered. Eventually, the hostess came by asked if we were doing okay and we asked if we might be able to get some beers. Based on the checking in I thought there must have been a reason she herself wasn't able to pour for us, which is entirely understandable. However, she did put our food order in for us to get it started (Thank goodness). She then went off and found whomever the chick was that was likely supposed to be tending bar. The service at the bar was not good at all. I was surprised that the two gents who were already sitting there when we arrived were actually helped after us and still there when we left. I was also surprised because when we first came into Casanova Brothers, the gentleman who was there at the time was just a really friendly and accommodating man. In this moment, I imagined that had he been there this day, the bar service would have likely been on point and the staff would be visible. Nevertheless, we waited our 45+ minutes for our pizzas and knew what we were looking at as far as wait time (thanks to the hostess) and took them home to share. I loved the veggie pizza (with spinach, next time I'm with broccoli). Although I'm not personally a fan of deep dish and that's what the man selected, it wasn't too doughy overall just too doughy for me, if that makes any sense? Next time, we'll likely call in our order, skip the beers and just devour the pizza."}, {"review_id": "KhXsPuTehzlrO2p_PcnIng", "user_id": "cL8Ics5CcTOsiV2oj_hY4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "First timer and will return.

Maybe it's because I am a Jersey girl but I expected more for the reviews this place had. The sub was nothing compared to an east coast sub, very little meat and even less toppings. I tried a plain slice and the sauce tasted more like it was out of a jar. My husband enjoyed his white slice. Oh and the zeppoles, NO, just NO. I worked at the boardwalk growing up and a real pizza place, italians everywhere would die if they ate the fried pizza sought, so dense, no crunch, No just No!  Overall disappointed.
