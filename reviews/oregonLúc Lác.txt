The pho noodles were typical ones that hung onto the soup very well. The different parts of the beef were delicious and my favorite was the brisket. Ordered the sausage and vermicelli and the spring roll was delicious! The spring roll texture was sticky and crispy. The sausage was so flavorful. It was so good I had to come back again the next day to try their happy hour and that was amazing too! The $2/$3 a dish was so worth it. My favorite was the crispy roll, pork skewer, papaya salad and chicken wings."}, {"review_id": "UPaw5Nt1gXvIwYkdVjJfhw", "user_id": "njZ4R3YDG8QQC84joarNHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Who can not give 5 Star? This place is so chic with good food and drinks. Their happy hour 4-7pm is awesome with $2/$3 appetizers OR just order pho or the rice plate, both amazing. I would say the rice plate is better than average and the pho, could be a little hotter in temperature. Their carbonated Thai tea is very innovative and I love the foam on top blending it after. So delicious! They also have a daily happy hour drink dealers choice for $6.No actual servers you order as you walk in the door before taking your seat.

Ordered way too much. Ate it all. This place is really cool. They have quality, albeit trendy-fied, Vietnamese food and are open late night. We had the spring rolls, cream cheese wontons, chicken wings, pork sausage banh mi, and la lot (stuffed betel leaves). The spring rolls were super fresh, chicken wings were interesting and meaty, and I could have eaten about 100 of the wontons. We weren't crazy about the pork sausage, but it was definitely not bad, just average. La lot, which is one of my all time favorite Vietnamese dishes, was a little on the bland side and meat heavy. As with any leaf-wrapped dish, a larger quantity of smaller rolls is always better than a smaller quantity of larger rolls, but that's just my preference. Overall pretty awesome."}, {"review_id": "2_a0TKpr7PV43iiWxSN9FA", "user_id": "Clo_mFSP9lBmTjnVgB7eYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "This place is known for long lines due to its well deserved popularity, and I've brought many friends out of town and country here - everybody loved it!

I'm glad that we stayed in line to try it out. On a Saturday around 7pm, it took us an hour to order and get seated.I ordered the Luc Lac and Thai tea creamosa. After ordering with the front you have to hang around the bar area until your table is ready. That is when I received my drink. The creamosa reminded me of an italian soda but with thai tea instead of the flavored syrup. It was light and fizzy; interesting but I wouldn't order it again. I also thought it was weird I received my drink before I got my food. I wanted to have it at the table but I guess it kept me at bay while waiting for the table.The luc lac is the star of the show here guys. The large cubes of stir fried beef sat on a bed of greens and red onions . The juice from the rendered beef oozed onto the greens and made every bite delectable. The beef was so tender and juicy I imagine the chef tenderized the beef in a way that Christian Grey himself would be proud of. Dipping the meat in the lemon & pepper juice, wrapping a piece of lettuce and marinated onion around it, and topping of with a bite of crunchy tomato was a delightful culinary adventure. The tomato rice was whatevs btw.I would eat this Luc Lac and only Luc Lac forever if i could. But then I tried the pho and I thought that was fantastic too! I will be having dreams of this place."}, {"review_id": "FXJ3BNM8pC6sa4GmoX9BSQ", "user_id": "PSnUXFT5luMvb73mQQSjUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "our go 2 place each time we come 2 RipCity..

No, because this is not traditional Vietnamese food. However, the ambiance, variety, and value make up for it. And those crispy veggie spring rolls and cream cheese wontons are to die for! I could eat myself sick on them. It's difficult finding cream cheese wontons without the crab in them in this city, so I highly recommend indulging in these while you're here. The vermicelli with tofu and spring rolls is my usual order, and always hits the spot. Big portion with lots of veggies. Really affordable despite the deceptive bougie decor. Very good, chic yet laidback place for dates. My only wish is that they'd serve decent Thai tea.

I was hesitant to begin with, just because we all know the best Asian food is usually served at tiny hole in the walls. Initially, I was thrown off by their seating system: line up to order at the counter, wait til your number is called for a table and then help yourself to utensils and water. It causes a HUGE bottleneck, with customers packing together like sardines near the front entrance.I tried the steak & brisket pho. Though the broth was really tasty, I just couldn't get over how overcooked and mushy the noodles were. They gave a generous portion of meat, but it was a little too dry in my opinion. My friend had the peanut curry, which could only be described by one word: bland. I would've rather eaten an order of their crispy rolls instead... those were delicious!I wish I could say Lúc Lác was worth the 1.5 hour wait in the pouring rain, but it'd be a lie.

We waited for at least 20 mins outside and after placing our order, we were sat immediately and our food came out within minutes. Normally I'd be stoked that the food came out fast, but this time, it seemed like everything was already pre-cooked and was just assembled. Portions were also so tiny. I shared the vermicelli bowl and there was barely any noodles, mostly just veggies. Also, do NOT get the sugar cane shrimp. It was the biggest waste of $7 for two extremely tiny pieces of shrimp paste - it wasn't even as big as a normal sized marshmallow. There was so little shrimp paste that I couldn't even get a flavor from it other than the green onion oil on top. If they're going to be this tiny, the least they could do is put 4 on the plate.With all the other food options in Portland, Luc Lac is definitely skippable."}, {"review_id": "BtLkYoTSSIZ4eJfrqJt5cA", "user_id": "YUlx_PoMfyS_3KuQmwdOmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Disclaimer: I visited as a tourist. This hip Vietnamese place was an interesting experience. Order, wait to be seated, and they will bring over your food. Things to know:- crowded- self serve- quick turnover so don't expect to linger Go in with those expectations, and your dining experience will be much easier. Food is your standard Vietnamese, and we ordered vermicelli bowls with bo tai steak salad. Everything was great, and of course you should choose pork over chicken. My only gripe was with the nuoc cham- it was a little too sweet and light on that umami fish sauce taste.

Blown away at how bad it was. Luc Lac was poppin' on Friday night and the line was almost out the door. You order at the counter, get your number, and then get seated when a table is available. I ordered the steak and meatballs steak and my boyfriend got a chicken rice plate. The gentleman taking our order was completely off in la la land and distracted. He just kept staring at us after we finished ordering; no total or anything. Just stared.... Awkward. Our food came out fairly quickly, but my order was wrong! Told the server that's not what I ordered and it seemed like it was the end of the world having to go back and get me my correct item. The pho itself was way too sweet and had an odd instant noodle powder packet taste to it. The chicken rice plate had chicken skewers (way too dry - it was like cardboard) and their \"crispy\" rolls that were super stale. Will I ever come back again? I don't think so - maybe I'm spoiled by my LA pho restaurants.

It's where I take out of town guests after we have done the more stereotypical Portland brewery dinner experience. I like how the portions are large enough that I always have enough leftovers for a second meal, and I like ordering at a counter and then being assigned a table once my food is ready. I like that people can't just monopolize tables while waiting without any food.But this place isn't a secret. It gets busy. I went on a Monday night around 8pm and I was in a line out the door, but when I went at 5pm on a weeknight I only had a short line to the counter. I get a combination plate with rice of beef, pork, and chicken. The pork really stands out and the beef is delicious too. The chicken is a little more bland, but I like the variety.  I just wouldn't only order the chicken. My real problem with this place is they put many small chopped peanuts all over my meal and this wasn't listed on the menu. Luckily, I'm not allergic, but I hate peanuts!! I also hate surprise ingredients, but I really hate peanuts. I think this should be clearly labeled on the menu, because then I would have requested them to be held, especially with the seriousness of peanut allergies. Maybe now from writing this review I'll remember to have them held. I don't go often enough to remember this detail usually, which is unfortunate, because overall I think this place is great."}, {"review_id": "dL6ERXO_u2Wue7widr8eYg", "user_id": "ylcjsNkIGOtyYC8pUVxo8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I dig this place.

The fresh spring rolls were great. There were only 2 in an order but the rolls were definitely fresh and substantial. The Chicken Pho was very interesting. It didn't taste like pho I've had before. I think it's the special five-spice beef broth that had a different flavor and more depth. I'm used to the more mild chicken broth that uses comes with chicken pho.
