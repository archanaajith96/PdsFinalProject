I Had the Turkey Bacon Pesto Melt and the jalapeño artichoke dip which was so good I couldn't stand it. I can't wait to go back and have the dip again. My sandwich was flavorful and had a very generous amount of turkey! Service was meh but it's a bar so I wasn't expecting outstanding service. They were nice but not attentive. It was super annoying that there was some local scavenger hunt clue above our table so people kept coming in being super obnoxious and invasive to our table. Not the establishments fault but insanely annoying. We will be back for sure."}, {"review_id": "flrzexbRfBMnjzJOgb2QXg", "user_id": "aU8fzFroVbFLUeD3x6nZQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Driving through Tacoma I was so excited to find a vegan option in this gem of a bar/restaurant. Every member of the staff was so friendly and accommodating! The food was really good - I had the vegan melt and my husband had the chicken pesto. It has a very relaxed atmosphere and kind of had a \"Cheers\" vibe because everyone seemed to know each other. Not in the best of neighborhoods, but that wouldn't deter me from going back if I'm ever there again."}, {"review_id": "D8D3Y4leKU5aSfXmjY0FOg", "user_id": "7ZujIjRTyRjWdv-MUZm5JQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I read some reviews about this place and decided to pop on in with my guy for lunch.

They have a great selection of hand craft sandwiches ranging from Reuben's to BLT's, Chicken Pesto to Philly Cheesesteak's. It's a nicely mixed array of people and a cozy place where sharing a tsble with stsngera isn't uncommon due to the loyal customers and limited space. I ate the Chicken Pesto with a cup of soup and it was amazing. Great flavor, great presentation and they free pour their drinks (that's the only way to do it right?). Overall a great spot that only a seasoned local would know about. A couple could eat and drink for around $40"}, {"review_id": "HOrCgIudjWiVzKSeZvl8OQ", "user_id": "3TsazoajL5ZNIryunNaMcQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Found this place on Uber Eats after I narrowed down my search to Vegan options.

I ordered the Cuban and my husband ordered the Rueben. We both exchanged half of our sandwich, and our favorite was the Cuban! My husband was born and raised in Key West and knows a good Cuban sandwich. He said it was very comparable and reminded him of home. The Rueben was okay, and it is not something either of us would order again, but I will be coming back! It's a fun place to go and grab a drink and sandwich."}, {"review_id": "leD8yI3IRz02aoGJP0SAWQ", "user_id": "uIEgy0LqMVR00DDKRvck6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Really liked this place, sort of a divey hangout that is apparently open and serving great food whenever I am hungry. The food was very tasty, the people serving me super nice and helpful. I was worried it might be a little sketchy but it was all good.

Stellar staff, great food, and a tailored selection of beers. If your in the area and need a quick bite or beer, this is the place. We had the pesto turkey, Cuban, and cold veggie sandwiches. All were great, tho the hot ones could've been hotter, but this didn't detract really from a job well done.

The moment I walked in (during lunch time), I noticed that it was half full. My husband and I were greeted by a gentleman at the bar (I did not get his name, but he had a distinctive Rainiers tattoo and a full beard). We sat at the bar and the bartender approached us with a smile. My husband is an IPA fan and did not know where to start with the beers (they had a pretty wide selection of beers considering how small the bar is)--- the bartender was kind enough to let us try a couple of different ones prior to making our final purchases. I had water since I've got work to finish....I had the lunch special (tuna sandwich) and my husband had the Reuben sandwich. I have to say that this place, hands down, sells the best sandwiches in town. The breads were toasted perfectly and it was not dry. The sauces were not overwhelming nor excessive in amount. The meat to bread to condiments ratio were perfect!Would I return? Definitely!Why the 4-star? That is because the bar has a slight, unpleasant smell -- something similar to wet, unwashed towels and mops. The restrooms appear clean; however, it smells like concentrated urine. What makes it worst is when a customer leaves the restroom door wide open after using it -- if you're sitting close to the restroom, you may smell it. Other than the unpleasant smell, they've got amazing sandwiches, beer straight from the tap, and awesome service all for a a reasonable price!"}, {"review_id": "Z2LOWv-b3lwht8PrsqVysw", "user_id": "M2JQml_xHbHmQNZMibccgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/11/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Moving this place to a 5 star. In the past month we have made two trips here. I think this place is excellent!! I have had 3 different sandwiches. Each one was really good. In addition they always have excellent beers on tap!! This has become another one of our Tacoma Staples. I think for cold sandwiches our place will always be MSM, but this has become our warm sandwich location."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-eleven-eleven-bar-tacoma?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
