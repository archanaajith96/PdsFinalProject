I was in gulf port with my kids on vacation. We were tired, hungry and searching for a good place for dinner. My son wanted pizza so I yelped it obviously. This place came highly recommend so we stopped in. Immediately we felt at home. Ordered at the counter but were waited on right off the bat. Garlic knots were fantastic. Pizza- fantastic. It was nice to be at a family owned pizza place. Thank you so much! Great dinner for a family homesick of their usual KC restaurants. You can move here anytime!"}, {"review_id": "7SzQJiAZt-PXY3vDd3hohQ", "user_id": "Dm0IBhAxIGgRwT3ExOH6jw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Quality ingredients in the pizza.

This place has the service and the quality of flavored food. We found this place online and then drove by and walked in we wanted a take a bake! This type of pizza was only promoted on their Facebook page and not their main website so it was a little disorganized but so happy they still do the take a bake approach to pizza.The space is very simple, it's not a sit down restaurant you want to spend hours in plus they have no wine, only beer and not a big selection. But let's talk about the positives here, we are always greeted with smiles and a can make anything you want on your exotic pizza. We have intricate needs, who gets pizza with no sauce or cheese... we do! But don't let that fool you, we jazz up our pizzas at home with some of our fancy cheese. They have one of the BEST meatballs I have experienced, the sauce is always well balanced with just the right touch of garlic and onions... I can eat themFor days. And our favorite pizza is the JERK chicken pizza wow, amazing flavor soo good! So happy we found this localGem."}, {"review_id": "PLc--cinui9W0L0rpTOXtg", "user_id": "CuKqiyIORRJNEt4XZJAVRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2018", "text": "OMG... seriously great pizza.

We love everything on the menu. HIGHLY recommend getting EXTRA Sarducci sauce since it's so good, you'll run out faster than you know it. Meatball subs are excellent and the canzone can feed an army.

I ordered a thin crust pineapple and jalapeño. I was not a big fan of the crust. It was not thin like I am used to thin being. It reminded me a little like microwave pizza crust even though I am pretty for sure it was house made. The sweetness of the pineapple was definitely there, but the fresh jalapeños lacked heat. Would I try it again? For sure. Side note, the owners are super personable.

Don't tell my doctor, but I have been a regular customer of Pizza Hut for as long as I have been living in the Armed Forces Retirement Home. I get tired of the food they serve here an need a break from time to time. I got the news tonight that they don't want to bring me pizzas any more. I guess they are making too much money. I think that bad news might turn out to be good news in the end, because it has forced me to find this place, C.A. Sarducci's.I had to use my finger to dial the phone and talk to an actual person instead of making my order on the interwebs, but it turned out OK. I talked to a real person and she was very nice. Instead of a series of choices and drop-down menus, she let me tell her what I like and made up my order from that. I'm waiting for my new pizza now. I don't really know for sure... it could be crap, but I don't think so. I've got a good feeling about this. So good, I think I'll go over to Pizza Hut and thank them for blackballing me.Epilogue:  It was the night of the big Hillary-Trump debate and I was ready to watch it, but even more ready for my pizza, which arrived tight on time. It was carried by a smiling young driver who seemed to be proud and happy to be bringing it to me. Once I had signed the charge slip and dropped a handful of shiny dollar coins into his palm, which is a different story, I opened the pizza box to find my medium thin crust meat-eater's pizza was still too hot to touch. No, really. It was too hot to touch. That has never happened to me before.As usual, I have forgotten to take a picture. I am not a very good reviewer after all, I guess. But I can say that my pie had  a crust that was crisp, not soggy. The sauce had some personality that sang under all that meat, and the meat was  ... well... let's just say it was generous. Two slices got me well into the debate. A third one a little bit later made me feel plenty guilty, and the rest of my pie is in the freezer for maybe a late breakfast or future dinner. Pizza is still a bargain once you learn the secret of re-heating it (hint: use a cast iron skillet over med heat).More than anything else, Sarducci's is a change from the other guys. I'm looking forward to seeing that friendly young guy again. I'd recommend you do the same.MsL"}, {"review_id": "oLaPrRy_zDRTg7mfB_VXGQ", "user_id": "xb1PXUTeSzIMIJMDU1lwBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2016", "text": "Let me start out by saying this was one the best experiences I've had going out to eat since I moved down here. We had heard about it through yelp, so I figured why not! Food was really great, from the pizza to the garlic knots. First off, the garlic knots were made from scratch (I could see the guy preparing them from my table) It's a pretty refreshing change of pace considering how most pizza places have pretty below average garlic knots. I ordered the Meat-lovers, and my girlfriend ordered the Chicken Alfredo. We got both small sizes on them. They have the pan sizes on the wall, but I can guarantee that the small size is plenty for one person to still take leftovers home! Do you know the best thing about a good pizza? When you take a slice from the pie, and the cheese is stringy? Haha, I suppose that's the word I'm looking for. Oh, and the toppings were all excellent. That's a high compliment, since our two combined pizzas had almost every topping there!Everything was incredibly fresh. They have their own marinara sauce that was surprisingly awesome! (Easy to tell if marinara sauce is made fresh because it'll taste a bit sweeter than the stuff that comes out of the can) The woman that served us was a completely delight. She checked on us at least 4 times, each time refilling our drinks. She cleaned up our appetizers as we were preparing to eat our pizza, and took the time to leave some extra marinara so my girlfriend could dip her pizza crusts. XD Later, she noticed my girlfriend was cold, so she went out of her way to bring the heater over to us. Not only was the food five stars, but the service was easily five stars as well.Heavily recommended."}, {"review_id": "BdEYsb35YuF5n4OTW4UGww", "user_id": "vRmx9mG6DIY-cZ26nR0gqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch.

I was pleasantly surprised at how understanding they were and willing to make up for it. The garlic knots are fantastic btw!

It is a local mom and pop restaurant that exceeded our expectations!!We ordered the garlic knots as our appetizer, and they were super delicious (sorry I didn't take any pictures, but there are many pics of what we ordered)!!For our pizza we got half supreme and half meat eaters. I didn't try the supreme (although it looked really yummy, except for the mushrooms, but my wife likes them), but the meat eaters was fantastic! They are definitely not stingy with the toppings here, nor were they all chopped up into super tiny bits that cannot be seen with the naked eye.The price was very reasonable, 23.00 for the garlic knots, a medium pizza, and a sweet tea (my wife got water). We only ate three pieces of pizza, and four of the garlic knots, so there is plenty for our lunch tomorrow. If there wasn't any pizza left it still would have been worth it because the flavor was fantastic!!"}, {"review_id": "a3DBMG7zFsVaauqIAbnNyg", "user_id": "z15FbJkXe6ElpszXU_YdYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2016", "text": "Awesome new pizza spot for our new condo.
