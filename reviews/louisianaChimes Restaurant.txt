I asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. It had no gamey fishy taste at all, just pure flavor. And the dill sauce they put on top was a perfect match.As soon as I tasted the  SPINACH ARTICHOKE dip I was addicted. I regretted having to share with the table because I wanted it all to my self. Using fried bow tie pasta shells as chips was GENIUS! I've never tasted anything like that. MUST HAVE MORE! (If there is any other place using pasta shells as chips for dip in New Orleans let me know) Their bread rolls are soft, chewy, and delicious.Service was great, no problems, very patient, quick with orders.

At first thought, our Uber drive accidentally dropped us off at a theater or something. The interior is very spacious and has an old look and feel to it. They have an EXTENSIVE beer list, so if you're looking for a drink this is a good option. Here's what I tried:Catfish Perdu: one-word SALTY! The dish was really salty and I was so thirsty after the meal. The catfish was okay, and the sauce kind of dominates the dish with the catfish just for texture.Overall, the food was just okay, but the beer selection was excellent. Was able to try a lot of Lousiana local brews.

I was told to go for happy hour and It didn't disappoint. The place gets busy quick, but it doesn't affect the service one bit. Our waiter was on point. Half priced oysters on the half shell for happy hour. Presentation is that of a dingy dive bar (I love dive bars!!) nothing fancy happening here, just really good food on a plate. We had the boudin balls (first timer here) they were absolutely amazing.. word to the wise let those suckers cool off before chomping them down. Lagniappe  cakes- absolutely amazing. A mix of seafood and crab! I could eat those all dayTurtle soup, really rich, great flavor but I struggled to eat the whole cup only because of the richness and I had sucked down a ton of oysters!!"}, {"review_id": "MQePP-3VCwmPj_x2ckx0iQ", "user_id": "tcELdUUtd6e-OwI9k5_Ocw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The atmosphere is always great! No wait on a busy Friday for lunch. Our waitress was great and took our orders promptly. We ordered the blackened alligator as an appetizer. It came out hot and was delicious, however, the pieces were quite smaller than usual.I ordered the crawfish etouffee for my meal. The food came out quickly and hot. The roll that came with my meal was fluffy and delicious, however, the etouffee itself was a different story. Though the crawfish itself was fantastic the rice was absolutely horrendous. The rice was terribly crunchy and was either old or undercooked making the meal highly unappetizing.I've been to The Chimes multiple times in the past and this was my first subpar experience. Hopefully, it will return to its normal level of quality for my next visit."}, {"review_id": "n3214YZ8KeCbgKIIcpFnxQ", "user_id": "eS43VFL0VWGcf3KkkOq_KA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Authentic Cajun Bar food with a great sports atmosphere.

Now, I seriously regretted not coming here earlier because if I actually knew how good this restaurant was, I would stop here everytime I pass by Baton Rouge for their BBQ shrimp poboy!The BBQ shrimp poboy is enormous but most importantly delicious. Think: a toasty sandwich over-filled with seasoned fried shrimps that have a glaze of sweet BBQ sauce and topped with cheese. Yes, it's as delicious as it sounds! I had great poboys throughout Louisiana including NOLA, and I think this poboy from Chimes is definitely one of the top ones I had.Other seafood menus on there look enticing as well and I may try them later, but I know that I will certainly return for that BBQ shrimp poboy again and again!

First off, the hostess was kind of rude (passive aggressive). It was just my wife and I and she gave us a table for 4, when we asked for a booth she gave a little attitude and was almost reluctant to change our table. We were the first customers so I didn't understand why this was a problem. Anyway, our waiter was a charmingly pleasant individual and helped us with everything we needed. My wife got the beans and rice which at first I made fun of her for until I had a bite, pure heaven! My catfish Po-boy was good but the fish was naturally bland (I was unaware since I never had catfish before).

The atmosphere is fine, very sports bar like and got noisy after the game crowd showed up. The service is \"okay\". The bus boy tried to play manager and told the waitress that the TV couldn't be changed, not even one TV, until the LSU game ended. The appetizer plates were dirty so we didn't use them. The menu is out of date apparently because after three different wine requests, I just stayed with water because they didn't have anything I liked...and I like a lot of wine! The beer received high reviews from my husband and honestly the price is very reasonable. What started out looking like a bad choice turned out okay. The food that saved the day: Stuffed mushrooms, grilled chicken entree topped with crab and a side of red beans and rice with sausage and crawfish étouffée."}, {"review_id": "8Q_IJr9TcFQA0jv3G2rGzw", "user_id": "xu6TstBPFNdhcjc-QmEtKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I've only been in for brunch but it was delicious!

It is located next to the Varsity cinema. They actually own that cinema. Sister company of Parrain's Seafood. A lot of high hope for this restaurant next to the university. This is very much university bar and restaurant. We love to get the experience with the student which brought back the memories I was the student here. The only thing I would said some of the item they not going to serve to to current regulations on the crab crawls. We have order the blacken Louisiana Alligator Tail and the special of the day crab cake for start. The gator tail certainly tasty but I think it need to be bigger pieces. The crab cake is great. Love the two appetizers. The entrée I have the charbroiled catfish and top with the BBQ shrimp. The catfish is good with the way it cook. However the BBQ shrimp is average. They can be better. Some shrimp shell is soft and not hard after cook. Service is average. However the close up is good and fast.
