Was told it was the best tacos in the city. So of course I was a little skeptical, but still a little hopeful.  After walking in and seeing the line, I assumed he might be right about how good it was.The House Taco (topped with pineapple) was so good.  I had two of them and probably could have ate 5 more.  They were kind of small, but each bit was packed with flavor. The meat was richly seasoned, the shell was soft, and the sauce was great.  The pineapple is what surprised me most about this taco, it was juicy and contrasting flavor paired well with the rest of the taco and sauce.The Baby Burrito was also good. There's not much to say about it. It was simple and it was good.Overall, it was kind of crowded and there was a short (10-15 mins) wait for the food, but it was worth it.  I'd recommend everyone and anyone at least try the house taco. I know the next time I'm in town I'm visiting this place again and getting more than three things."}, {"review_id": "-EsvS35fRXPcuB3NcSMLfg", "user_id": "y_ltHb1MbiF1_JZyN_df_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "**Vegetarian Friendly**This is a hole in the wall taco joint!

Nothing will ever hold up to my ultimate favorite: a pair of carne asada tacos slung off a food truck outside the 99-Cents-Only store in Reseda. So of course, when in Seattle, make a beeline for what are allegedly the best tacos in the city. Tacos Chukis betrays their name and goes for some other classic favorites as well, include a cactus plate, tortas, and burritos. This is apparently the holy grail of the city, as when we stopped by for dinner one evening, the room was packed with diners eyeing seats and a very, very long line of people looking for cold Modelos.We couldn't settle on what to eat, so my significant other and I shrugged at our expanding waistlines and ordered, well, almost everything. On the menu for us that night were two tacos chukis, one carne asada taco, one adobada mulita, a chicken quesadilla, and a carne asada burrito.Meat is straight up the only thing on the menu here. I had to readjust to a burrito that was literally only carne asada (no rice, no beans, no nothin'), which is surprisingly quite pleasing. Because everything was so juicy and well-spiced, it felt like we were splitting a balanced meal.You gotta come here and try the mulita and tacos chukis, though. Their adobada is the star of the show, and when paired with some refreshing avocado and grilled pineapple, it absolutely shines. If you haven't had a mulita before, it's essentially a \"mini\" quesadilla with open sides all around, stuffed full of melty cheese and meat. The cheese oozes out onto the griddle, creating a crispy web of salty goodness.Although the regular tacos and quesadilla are not forgettable, they didn't exceed my expectations the way the others did. It would be great if they could work out some upstairs or outdoor space for more seating because there's no organization to getting seats. Bar-like seating is available, but it's very cramped because it's flush against the line for the cash register and interrupted by the drink fridge."}, {"review_id": "almDIglZ0uSu9W2lMdYFUw", "user_id": "8PzeF5qcFg07ii0KaK2FUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Overall: 4.5/5 rounding up to a 5.Taste: 4.5/5. Having had some pretty bomb tacos in mexico, this place is about as authentic as you can get. I got the baby burrito and the taco chukis (pork for both) and was very satisfied. I liked the tacos a bit better though. Value: 4/5. It's $2.50 for a taco. A regular hungry person would want to get maybe 3 tacos to feel satisfied. Ambeince: 3/5. The shop is hard to find. It's in the Alley smoke shop and up the stairs into some attic-like space. Seating is a little hard to get and it's definitely more of a hole-in-the wall feel.

I've been to Tacos Chukis many many times and just can't get enough. My to-go's are the tacos chukis and the quesadilla. The grilled pineapple just increases the flavour of the taco exponentially. They add a plenty generous amount of guac as well. And the quesadilla will definitely satisfy your cheese craving. All the items come with plenty of meat and other ingredients. All the meats are perfectly seasoned, you really can't go wrong with any of them. The prices are crazy cheap, at 2.5$ a taco chukis and 4$ a quesadilla. I would gladly pay more for it though because it's just soooo good. Just be prepared to take it to go though, because this place can often be very busy (for a good reason!)."}, {"review_id": "XFgidIvdwC9LZzEUvDsfTg", "user_id": "mGv78vrEjVgRmekvMNY-7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Best taco in town!

Cheap, authentic, tacos in Capital Hill :) I ordered the Baby Burrito (Carne Asada) and the House Taco (Taco Chukis). If I had to reorder, I would just order like 4 of the House Tacos. The Baby Burrito was good but all I could really taste was meat, onions, and cilantro. Personally, I like my burritos/tacos with more pico de gallo or something other than just meat. The House Taco however was soooo good. The grilled pineapple on top was definitely my favorite part. One thing I did notice is that this place is located on the second floor of an old building. I did not see an elevator or escalator (I may have missed it?) However, if there really isn't an elevator this place would be hard to get to for people who can't walk up a flight of stairs. The restaurant itself is also pretty small/limited seating. I would suggest ordering to go."}, {"review_id": "St0EZq17ImHn3dvhqgLNgg", "user_id": "HTyZDwjW-jUU6QJ8lhh0fQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "The carne asada is probably one of the best I've had, very juicy and flavorful!

Fun to try but I think I like it without the cheese better.

I also really like their carne asada taco as well. Honestly you can really to wrong with anything on their menu. All their meats are cooked perfectly and tastes amazing with their house sauce they put on their tacos as well.

Most of my yelp friends that had been there gave it a green light (4-5 stars). I thought to myself that it was about time to transport myself into this taco dreamland.The joint itself is located on the second floor of a building. There are signs so navigation wouldn't be an issue. We ordered three different tacos (carne asada/beef, adobada/pork, and pollo asado/chicken). They all came with cilantro, lime, and green sauce (presumably pobleno crema) which enhance the overall flavor. All of the meats were well-spiced. However, I do agree with some reviews that the chicken was dry and less flavorful; making it the least enjoyable. As others have mentioned, the adobada comes with grilled pineapple. Yes, I know you're probably cringing on the idea but it was totally a game changer. The sweetness and zestiness added another layer of flavor that apparently went extremely well with the tacos! On top of that, if you like to spice it up, get the small cup of hot sauce for 25 cents! It's more than worth it! I tried their horchata which I didn't really enjoy. It was overly sweet and left weird aftertaste. Pass.. They also offer other dishes (mulitos, quesadilla, burritos, nopal asado, and tortas) in case you're not in the mood for tacos.Cheap yet delectable ($2), these tacos are my favorite to date!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-chukis-seattle?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
