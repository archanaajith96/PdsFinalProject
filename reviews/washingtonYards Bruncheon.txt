I will plan to come back if I am ever in Spokane again. I had the omelet with tomatoes, goat cheese, some nuts, and avocado. It also came with breakfast with breakfast potatoes. It was fabulous! We also ordered the homemade donut holes that melted in my mouth! They change up the type each day. It came with some kind of tasty caramel dip.The service was great! It was very clean and had lots of windows so the atmosphere was very bright."}, {"review_id": "bK58grvvMIznq60ZciXO1A", "user_id": "Sg_BvnTHsbc1AABiJjaiPA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Saturday brunch around 10:00, waited awhile (maybe 20 mins?) but they'll start you on some coffee as you wait. Cute spot with good atmosphere, lots of lil shops etc around to peruse afterwards. Staff was busy and a lil frazzled. The breakfast burrito was on the bland side so it def needed lots of the salsa, the AM fried rice was saltier than I'd like with the soy sauce and pastrami (and they really should use gochujang if they're going the kimchi route). The serving sizes are AMPLE."}, {"review_id": "hp_rSq_fmyiCFJ9GMNDiIQ", "user_id": "taQ3SZLNPAGYs_uVPtm-iw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Oh. My. Gosh. What an amazing place! We came here for breakfast and were literally not disappointed. My favorite color is Tiffany blue first of all and the walls are just that color! I'm so excited about this review. We didn't have to wait at all and were seated immediately which is refreshing for a Saturday. The diner vibes are awesome and they gave me a free copy with my Yelp check in. #yelplifeyo. Our food was so good too. Fresh tasting, authentic, delicious. I LOVED the avacado toast. The people was great and we received top notch service. Excited to come again.

We were greeted by a nice lady who took our name down, there was about a 30 minute wait. We walked around the area and came back shortly afterwards. We were seated after another 10 minute wait. After taking a look at the menu, I ordered the Roasted Tomato & Avocado Omelet and my friend ordered the AM Fried Rice. The food took a little longer to get to us but it was worth it! Both plates were delicious. If you come here, try to avoid Sundays as they are very busy. I would recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "PZ3p_4f6rHn3X3HIwA7HcQ", "user_id": "a3BvBiFd-qLj7uR-8xzr_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Well-worth the 45-minute wait.

Our server was wonderful. I didn't get her name, short, dark hair, very cute, very nice. I had the eggs Benedict... Fantastic! My daughter had the Chorizo tacos...loved them. I had a fantastic bloody Mary, daughter had an oj mimosa. I saw they had a maple bacon deviled eggs...I thought they sounded just awful enough to be delicious. No. They were as bad as it sounds. It's not their fault though. There wasn't anything wrong with them. I guess you just have to have a taste for that. Looking around at other people's food, I was just astounded at how delicious it all looked. I'm going to be returning over and over again!!!!"}, {"review_id": "rr1bROJw2DngZxwPRYto0g", "user_id": "5mcXwO3zuAzEnEuUQRActA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Great service, I was just underwhelmed by the food.  Other have posted great reviews but personally it was not anything exceptional."}, {"review_id": "HNv8-kZ21EKez3BIBdhDBQ", "user_id": "bjsy_SJSBOweR1isS0Y2EQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Love Yards brunch!

Yards Bruncheon was just the perfect spot to spend a morning. The location is nestled among many other shops and restaurants, with string lights hanging over the outdoor patio, if you choose to dine outside. With it's mint green walls and black and white tile floor, the ambience is reminiscent of a 50s dinner, (minus the really greasy spoon.) The coffee was alright, but the menu variety was the standout. I'm a major sucker for Huckleberries and their huckleberry pancakes with huckleberry syrup just made my whole morning! You get three, HUGE jacks, and they are fluffy and light and sweet and delicious! I ordered a side of scrambled egg and sausage, which consistent of two plump links that just hit the spot and completed the meal! I believe their logo is a Turducken? Service was decent. My friend and I were somewhat dismissed when we entered, the waitress basically said \"Two? Sit wherever-you-like.\" As she turned and walked away. Our actual waitress was quite attentive, and solid about bringing coffee refills, topping off our water and grabbing me an extra side of syrup (because...yum.) The price was also quite reasonable! Of the four days I spent in Spokane this was, hands down, the best food and service of any restaurant I tried!"}, {"review_id": "qmiKYewkFYL3FMzxhqU0qg", "user_id": "A7vMYdUn5HN8GVGl4cdqNg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "These guys destroy eggs Benedict.   3 Times I've been and they hard boil the Eggs every time."}, {"review_id": "fGDhVf20qpYPbNehGmxKhQ", "user_id": "L_NfiXZcF1qPUwGFcosgkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "We were craving the Yard's Huevos Rancheros dish, which is always SO delicious without fail.

Ordered:Bloody Mary'sPoutine Brunch burgerDeviled eggsKale red pepper saladReading the menu I had high expectations and they have really good ideas but their execution fell short.  Bloody Mary was flavorless except for some bland pepper.  Deviled eggs have a great creamy texture but the syrup and egg white was over powering.  I was super excited about the brunch burger but again the sweet maple was over powering.  I expected a salty sweet burger but it was just sweet and it had the saddest half piece of bacon ever.  With my burger I had a side salad of the red pepper kale salad.  I was super excited about this salad because it has candied sunflower seeds...yummy idea.  However, they missed this on my salad, but when asked my waitress promptly brought me some and they were delicious.   The poutine was delicious, only criticism is make your own fries.  So overall, great ideas just work on execution.  Service was prompt but asbesntminded.  Coming from Seattle the price was awesome!"}, {"review_id": "ZiTYHTx_O5_s70kDwEVDXA", "user_id": "mwIDLX6JQ488I6lXa-D2qg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Huevos Rancheros rock.  Beautiful presentation and tasty.  May be the best I've had.  Paired well with Bloody Mary.  I stole a few garlic fries from my wife when she wasn't looking.  Fries were good, but the garlic seem to be lost."}, {"review_id": "rEfUUfUSfLxKBv07PnrVAw", "user_id": "kPgNVSxXnhkyWBkqTcW45g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2016", "text": "\"All fresh, everything!\"Man, from the coffee and fresh OJ, to the poutine...
