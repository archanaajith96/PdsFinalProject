Tonight when I called Jessica answered again. It was 9:00, they are open until 10:00. First thing she tells me is \"we don't have any pasta\" I said \"no problem\" since I wasn't going to order pasta anyway. Then she says \"hold on\" and I hear her talking to someone, she gets back in and tells me \"We aren't doing delivery anymore tonight\" my response was \"Well I'm looking right at the website and it says you deliver until 10:00\" she says \"Well my cook is sending the delivery driver home because it's been really slow tonight.\" So basically I was told that my business wasn't good enough for them?! I mean, I'm sorry it's been slow but I'm trying to give you business here - I definitely won't be trying to again!!!"}, {"review_id": "Y043eM42pFI3vM87alnFPg", "user_id": "YQSwlsXDhxegjT_1TSgvsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2017", "text": "My husband took me here for dinner and it has been one place I've been wanting to try since I moved to Nampa. So glad we got the chance! Although I didn't have wine with my meal- I was very impressed with the wine selection-thought it would be nice to bring a wine drinker next time! The Alfredo dipping sauce for the bread was delicious along with the dish I ordered-Veal Parmesan. The tomato basil soup was a hit-even for my husband! We both enjoyed the homemade salad dressing as well! Can't wait to go back! The older music was fun too!"}, {"review_id": "WAJ-k_bxM1ggybSixzW2Rg", "user_id": "XcB7GI4FXaAwOHq6tV5jFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "We found ourselves in downtown Nampa shopping for old LP's and stumbled across this quaint little place.  While very small inside,  4 tables,  it is cozy and clean. It was a hot summers day and something cold sounded great to me.  The wife worked in a similar pizza joint in her teens so she was anxious to try the pizza.  She ordered the Margarita and I a cold Salami with a salad.  I asked for their Italian  dressing.  It was so good we bought some.  ($7 a bottle but so worth it).  Yea,  the place was full and only one waitress but she worked her butt off and never missed a beat.  Our water glasses we're always full . It took a few minutes,  probably 20, for our food but mmmmmm mmmmmm.  Was it ever good! Fresh and pack full of meat was my sandwich.  She brought me a side of the Italian dressing to dunk it in and Viola!  Perfection!!.  My wife ate my side of soup as I didn't want hot and claimed it was the best Italian wedding soup ever. There is outside patio dinning as well.  The cook came out and told us his family has been in the Italian restaurant business since 1949. Turns out his father & uncle had restaurants in some of the same California towns I lived in as a child.  I probably sampled some way back in the 60's or 70's.  You won't be disappointed here.  Good beer and wine selection and prices were good too.  $8 for my sandwich and $12 for the pizza."}, {"review_id": "gVLs3QTO8LZcARAGB60m1Q", "user_id": "yrBxqMkCx19SNdd71DpcRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "Best patio dining in Nampa BY FAR!! We have been in a few times and the food is consistently great and very fresh. The service is a bit slow but that's expected as the place is ALWAYS packed and they only have 2 servers. The relaxed environment puts you at ease and you don't really don't mind the wait. I wouldn't however recommend if you're wanting a \"in and out\" quick dining experience. The waitress is very friendly and quite efficient. I'd tell you to make this a regular weekly dinner spot but I really don't want this place to get any more crowded!! Haha. Seriously though... great patio, great wine, great food... go go go."}, {"review_id": "DvVL-gLiUYPuudR3mH61sQ", "user_id": "-7c9_cVlKtKD0MozmLLrTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2017", "text": "Italian To Go is a nice little spot in downtown Nampa that serves all kinds of tasty Italian dishes. It's a small establishment that is most likely family-owned. Professional but doesn't take itself too seriously. The vibe is definitely hole-in-the-wall; you can tell most customers are regulars.We got a med half-Margarita half-Gourmet with shrimp which cost roughly under $20. The Gourmet is the most expensive; most pizzas are around $17, which is very reasonable for what we consider a higher-end establishment. Pizza took the usual 15-20 mins to arrive.-Margarita-Gotta love that olive oil on the crust. The garlic adds an extra kick too. Cheese is delicious; melty but not falling apart. They asked us if we wanted fresh or sun-dried tomatoes and we went with the sun-dried. Didn't really work well but that's on us. I'm sure it would have been great with the fresh tomatoes.-Gourmet-Ok so this is a za with alfredo sauce, shrimp, mushrooms, olives, and bell-peppers. I don't like seafood paired with cheese, olives are a no-no for Tom, and mushrooms are tolerable for both of us. You can understand our surprise when this pizza was absolutely delish. I don't know how this pizza did what it did, but it just worked. Tom usually picks the olives off his slice but he was keeping them on. Definitely recommend this one.-Verdict-Dude, if you live in Nampa, this is the place to go to. People will tell you to hit up Messenger but don't listen to them they're just posers.4 slices out of 5"}, {"review_id": "YtZyoFb8LQfElnVX_I1MMw", "user_id": "uwsWlgP3nLO3l1egdJEeAw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "Very friendly atmosphere.

I said it was fine again then she said it could be two to three hours??? She then said I don't want their food. I should eat somewhere else?!

Usually take out is hit or miss but this was packaged in a way that allowed us to really enjoy our meal as if we ate at the restaurant. I ordered the beef ravioli and hubby ordered the spaghetti siciliano. We ended up trading meals after a few bites of each - he prefers a heavy meat dish and I will eat anything Italian anytime  the rolls are delicious and so was the cheese bread. Wish we would have splurged for a dessert. Next time we will try a calzone and definitely order double rolls. All food was good leftover the next day. Yum. Thanks for providing awesome food in Nampa, it has been hard for us to fine a regular dinner joint for our lazy nights. The kids loved the spaghetti too!"}, {"review_id": "UHMQISbzPLU2qJKtHGgmIQ", "user_id": "gWwJia1YMRNl0hl0n4ARMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/9/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "From the moment we walked through the door, the smell of homemade Italian food captivated my taste buds. I grew up with an Italian grandmother who set the bar high on Italian food. Of course, this might be slightly biased. Nonetheless, the sourdough roll and Italian Wedding soup were a great start to our meal. The small cafe feel was a bonus in our eyes. No mega restaurant feel here. The wife had the half spaghetti/half ravioli dinner. I chose the Cannaloni. Both were amazing. My second roll cleaned my dish of any leftover sauce. A dark Italian beer complimented my choice while a French red satisfied my wife's pallet. Many a pizza went out the door while we dined. We're coming back to try the pizza. We were to full for dessert, but I hear they are amazing too. Maybe next time with the pizza!!07/09/2016 - UpdateOk, last night was Pizza Night, and we had to come back and try the pizza here.  We ordered a side of Sicilian garlic bread and a medium combination pizza. I swear I literally could smell the garlic the minute they started making the bread....which is actually a pizza style garlic bread, served on a thin crust. We totally enjoyed it but had to take some home so we could eat some pizza too!  If you are like me, and you love a variety of toppings, then the combination here will surely please. It's completely loaded. I told my wife it was like a clown car in a circus in that the flavors wouldn't stop coming out!  We were very pleased. Crust is a thin type crust which we are more apt to get these days so not to fill up too fast!Dessert!Ok, we also tried the Gelato and the Tiramisu. Both were excellent and cheaply priced compared to other places."}, {"review_id": "L-Cy0FeqpXsXFnxTy-Amxw", "user_id": "M2NS_aQbMY2apoYjTlOCng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/13/2015", "text": "We walked in to Italian to Go, expecting a takeout-only eatery, based on the name. Not really, but we laughed at the name.This charming restaurant is located near the new library in downtown Nampa. There's only a few tables and room for a couple more people at the bar, plus several tables outside when the weather is good. I ordered penne with a red meat sauce and meatballs. Theresa ordered the manicotti. Both were large portions and very flavorful. We were there on a Friday night when it seemed like they were missing another server. It took quite a while to get our order but the quality of the food made it worth the wait.
