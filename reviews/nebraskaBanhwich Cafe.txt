I used to go here multiple times a week when I lived in Lincoln. BF and I actually breezed through 5 or 6 punch cards, and this was AFTER we'd already been frequenting the location for a few months! I don't live in Nebraska anymore, but this is a restaurant I think about often and talk about just as much. The banh mi are simply delicious and you really can't go wrong with any of them. My love, my life, my everything, is the masaman curry banh mi with tofu. I prefer the tofu because it holds onto the flavor of the  curry much better and the texture is more appealing to me. Holy moly is it ever flavorful. The bread was always deliciously crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The mushroom pate is genius; one of the best things you could ever put on a sandwich. Just thinking about it makes me tear up because it was THAT good. I have eaten a lot of banh mi, but nothing can compare to the flavorful harmony of the ingredients in the masaman curry sandwich. Taro boba was always my go-to drink, and I liked to add the rainbow jellies along with the tapioca pearls. The green waffle is the best dessert I've ever eaten. It's so crispy yet slightly chewy and perfectly sweet.I haven't been here in about a year, but I'm so excited because I'm visiting Lincoln soon, and I can't wait to buy 20 sandwiches and throw them at people as I drive home. Gotta spread that banhwich love!"}, {"review_id": "gXXuhBvHPF4nZWZZUFswxw", "user_id": "ZiT62CjnigNt2PTUclEG9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Banh mi + taro milk tea smoothies!

Maybe this is a one off, but it was the saddest banh mi I've ever had (see pics). It was such a meager serving. The guy behind the counter kept coughing and talking about how he had pickled veggies stuck in his throat. That's really appetizing while you're waiting for them to make your food. It's not even during peak hours. I was one of two customers in the establishment and it took them a couple minutes to even acknowledge my presence (3 workers in front). I got the #12: pork patty roll & pâté. I had to search for the pâté and there were two thin slices of pork roll.

I'm glad I stopped here. The prices are really reasonable, as all but three of the sandwiches are less than $5. They have tons of options with close to 20 different sandwiches. I went with the #13, the grilled beef and spicy Thai chicken banh mi for $5.50. Lemongrass on a sandwich? It was DElicious. The bread was perfectly crisp. I also like that they have the jalapeño on the side so you can decide whether you want to take bites or have it on the sandwich. I also got a taro tea. I decided to try the mango boba which I figured was just flavor added to the the tapioca. I was wrong. This boba was a soft capsule, filled with a syrupy liquid that burst when you tried to chew it. Ick! It actually kind of ruined the drink. If you like the texture of boba tea, just go with the traditional/tapioca or you will be disappointed. I probably would have given a 5th star if not for the inaccessibility of the restroom. That's a pretty big inconvenience as I am not from Lincoln and had to find a different place to use the restroom. I also can't get how nasty that boba was out of my mind. The experience was great otherwise. I plan to come back and try that Waffle!"}, {"review_id": "EHlAEcXGRkwlz6YcMuxbKQ", "user_id": "Fy5QYxVM7miOfzjR_N1raQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "Their banh mi is crazy good.

I got my drinks, left and had to return since my order was wrong...all I had in there was the lychee popping boba, not the regular boba, as specified. I'm not a fan of those popping balls. When I returned, the cashier said all they have is the lychee popping boba, not jelly. This wasn't specified to me when I first ordered. I paid for the lychee + tapioca. He said he can add the regular tapioca into my drink, then gave it back to me and walked away. And he didn't correct our second drink, which was the exact same thing and missing the tapioca.
