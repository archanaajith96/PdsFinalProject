We were on a long drive home to CA from Louisiana, and this stop was a delightful treat opposed to chain restaurants, hotels, and diner food. They were also surprisingly kid-friendly. Memorable service moment: I returned to the lobby after getting seated, just to check out the ambiance and selection. A server offered assistance, and gave me some history and information on the wines. Despite the fact I was seated for dinner, he additionally gave me tastings of 2 of his recommendations for the meal. I look forward to visiting again, and ordering wine online. Definitely worth the stop!"}, {"review_id": "mVMkKoP_9wsT_IQk1meyMA", "user_id": "xOZmlipuC8SSREVspj3hhQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "This place, like all restaurants had its pros and cons. The bread, so good! The food was okay. And the wine was alright but I've definitively had better.We came here with a big group on a Wednesday evening. There was about 12 if us. We had a reservation and got seated right away. Our waitress was super woman and took care of us herself. She gave us wine samples and our waters never ran empty. And our fresh bread came out very timely and warm.My side of the table ordered some appetizers. We got edamame, Brussels sprouts, and the bacon wrapped shrimp. They edamame came with a very tasty dipping sauce. They edamame wasn't anything special, just normal edamame. The Brussels sprouts were very tasty, with some caramelized bacon. I enjoyed them very much and the bacon added a great twist. For the bacon wrapped shrimp, it has a bit of jalapeño flavor, which really added to it. It came with about 5 little squires of large shrimp. It was probably my favorite of the appetizers. I order the steak, with shrimp potatoes and vegetable medley. I also got a cup of the soup if the day which was a poblano cream soup. I very much enjoyed the soup. My steak was overcooked, unfortunately but the potatoes were yummy. We ordered a bottle of wine, but it was sweet for my taste so I only had a few sips of it. Overall, the meal was tasty. I don't think I would go back for the meal or wine alone. Maybe some soup and bread. It was okay, but over priced for mediocre food."}, {"review_id": "PI1ui2MADxrA8SEBfhq7fg", "user_id": "npBvbJQoUMs9WDkcyoOpFg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "It is now one of my favorite restaurants in New Mexico! I had never been here before and I was delighted and really enjoyed it! As soon as we got there we were greeted with friendliness and were seated right away. We didn't have to wait at all. We chose to sit at the beautiful outdoor patio, which has a beautiful view it's very refreshing and nice. Our waitress was super attentive, friendly and gave good recommendations. This place has a large selection of New Mexico wines and local craft beers. We started off with St.Clair Bellissimo bubbly and Calamari as appetizer. It was too breaded for my taste but yet good enough. I had the Kale and Brussel Sprout salad with Shrimps. It had an agave Dijon vinaigrette dressing, almonds, dried cranberries, and parmesan. Which was delicious and definitely fulfilling. We also ordered the Pecan Crusted Chicken accompanied by a bed of mashed potatoes and green beans, also delicious! They have a to go menu for wine and food and right at the entrance is a wine tasting bar. Where you can taste any wine you'd like and shop for wine accessories too. On the way out, we decided to taste a couple of wines and finally decided to take the D.H Lescombes Rosé. I absolutely love St.Clair winery and Bistro!!!!"}, {"review_id": "b37p12ihEojo4V82sJK_eA", "user_id": "Od-KDFuRGcYUfWY-kgIYqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Delicious food and wine out on a beautiful patio, overlooking a vineyard.

The picturesque Oregon Mountains were also in the background which made the restaurant scenery unreal.  The Mimbres Red is amazing (very sweet) and compliments the food wonderfully!  The Chicken Parmesan dish balances the Alfredo and Marinara sauces with the  pasta but doesn't take away from the star of the dish, the chicken. The pecan crusted chicken was perfectly breaded, with a sweet but subtle whole grain mustard sauce, and perfectly sautéed green beans on the side."}, {"review_id": "264TcaQf_FO8WxkMeAED6g", "user_id": "U0zs7ThbC6JyInUkBN7qRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "This place deserves a five star.

There are the wineries. There are the steakhouses. And then there is...St. Clair Winery & Bistro.C Dub n' B is legit! You pull into the parking lot and almost expect something resembling Cattleman's decorum. However, when you step inside and see the grand selection of wines, the elegant bar and immaculate dining area...you instantly realize you're not just dining at your typical winery and bistro.I gotta say though...I had at least a good ten minutes to stare vacantly at the decorum. Because that's about how long it took for me to get noticed by any true server after being immediately greeted and seated by the hostess. I began to wonder if the entire waiting staff took a smoke break all at the same time.Rough starts aside however, I was finally served and the service only complimented on what was to come. It's always nice to see a server that actually enjoys their job. This guy really knew his wines and never hesitated to make recommendations. Since I managed to earn a free wine flight upon initial check in, I was able to sample 3 additional wines that night, on top of the house Cabernet I had already ordered.So as you can probably guess, I went with a mostly beef themed night. I started off things with the French onion soup. And for the main course: the hand cut ribeye topped off with shrimp scampi. Let me just cut to the spoilers now: if you're gonna get this dish, get it with the shrimp scampi on top. Trust me! It may sound strange at first. But once you taste all those sauces blending perfectly together like Beethoven's 10th symphony, you'll wanna slap me through this monitor (or smartphone screen) for not dining here much sooner so that I could boast to you.Right off the bat, presentation of the main course was spot on! But before I get into the details of the almost perfect surf n' turf combo, I gotta tell ya...the thing that really surprised me....was the garlic red skin mashed potatoes. Never in my entire dining experience that I can recall have I ever NOT needed to put at least a little salt into my side dishes. This rendition of garlic mashed was the first. It was so close to creamy, buttery, garlic-y (is that a word?) perfection, all I needed to add to it was pepper.As for the ribeye, it was cooked a perfect medium. The thing that made this steak so delicious was the fact that it was swimming in the ultimate delectation of perfectly blended sauces. The scampi sauce is what really helped it. I can barely describe it but...it's like if you took the perfect scampi sauce and combined it with the perfect gravy for a Steak Diane. Oh, and the shrimp scampi...sweet mother of Mercury!! This shrimp was cooked perfectly! I was honestly surprised. So many places like this usually are lucky to even nail one protein whilst doing merely okay on the other. But tonight, they nailed both.The French onion soup was delicious, too. Only minor inconvenience for me was how the cheese on top was super thick. It's not really the first time I've encountered this in a French onion soup. Fact is...this is a pretty tricky soup to make perfectly. But I prefer mine to have a light coating of shredded cheese so that I don't have to essential \"cut\" my way through to the broth and onion composition. But like I said, all the flavors were there. So these are minor caveats.Yes, C Dub n' B was clearly worth the hilly 30 minute drive from my temporary place of duty this time around. A vast improvement from my previous misadventure to Sakura. Plus, I've been meaning to make my way to this place for a while now....if ONLY to take a photo of the steak. I swear, there must be at least 3 or 4 meatloaf pics on this page. It's like...okay...I get it! You guys love the meatloaf. One pic would have sufficed. Seriously!Anywho, I've giving this place 4 pedestals of red wine flying me straight into a delectably inebriated state of heaven out of 5."}, {"review_id": "dcVJjQiwWtHNuncyqIYG7A", "user_id": "7EoOo60u976lR4k7syYyTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Relaxing place for lunch in Las Cruces.

I went to their brunch and I kid you not 3 hours we were there. Another time I went with my dance team and first of all it took about an hour and 1/2 to get our food which is understandable for a big group of people but they forgot one of my teammates food and made her wait a extra hour for her salad to come out.

Sad management.  Where I come from managers remake the meal and see to it that it's hot, others will buy you a dessert for the trouble, SOMETHING to make it right since it didn't come out good twice.  Nothing, not even an apology.
