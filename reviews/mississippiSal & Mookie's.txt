A local we met at the park highly recommended it. We went over for a late lunch after the museum and playing at the park. It's on a side street right next to the JSU stadium.The parking lot was nearly full when we arrived. We were greeted and seated immediately.The place is much larger than it appears. It looks like a big single story house with a wrap around porch. Brick floors, lots of wood, open visible kitchen, ample seating.Our server came over as soon as we were sat by the hostess. She was perky and friendly.After viewing the large menu for several minutes we went with a regular - 14 inch- Meat Packing District which includes: italian plum tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, spicy italian sausage, prosciutto, and genoa salami. The pizza came out far quicker than I expected.It was fresh from the oven. It looked awesome.Kids were pumped. It was excellent pizza. Good ingredients.  The House made crust was really good with a soft buttered pretzel flavor and a nice chew. Ever so modest slightly charred areas. Great for young kids and for kids that typically don't eat the crust like my son. He ate his crust today!A regular was plenty for 2 adults and a small child. Daughter had an entire slice, son had 2 I had three. I didn't need 3 but I managed. In addition to pizza they have a huge menu.Italian favorites, burgers, salads....My kids liked the in store ice cream stand. They had a couple dozen flavors of ice cream by the scoop and a large selection of toppings.Daughter went chocolate w m&ms son went with some specialty chocolate flavor.The manager came over and chatted me up a bit. Nice guy made some recommendations in the French Quarter - New Orleans our final stop Sunday afternoon. All in all a very good experience. If in the area I would absolutely recommend. Cool hangout fun place for adults and kids with good food and ice cream what more could you ask for?"}, {"review_id": "gZL2QPw7F80kblFq4hZw_A", "user_id": "tfX4C40-ZHp79tqZ2iFU9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Sal & Mookie's has authentic Italian pastas and pizzas. The ingredients, preparation, and service are first-rate.  I had the pasta and meatballs; the sauce obviously prepared from scratch from somebody's mother's recipe and was finished with chopped fresh basil. My wife had the ominously-named Rikers Island pizza which had authentic Italian sausage and fresh toppings. She noted that it was grease-free and baked to perfection. Portion sizes are generous and prices are reasonable. The thing that I noticed most was the abundance and cheerfulness of the servers. Whoever is training and managing their team is doing things the right way.  And they have spumoni ice cream!  The only downside is that it is rather noisy. Lots of  families enjoying a 1960's vibe. Highly recommended."}, {"review_id": "dbss7b5Ql33OFrPXTfxt7Q", "user_id": "0mbpZKwbdZTM0rhehWUodg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "We are from New York. So we are very critical on pizza. But we have to give credit where credit is due. This is about as good as you will get in MS. I am not talking 5 boroughs of NY good, but it is good and similar to about an hour north of NYC, so definitely a compliment:) Service was always good as well.

This is my favorite pizza I've had in Jackson. The crust is a perfect combo of thin and chewy with a good crispy crust that tastes buttery. We made our own pizza with pepperoni and ricotta. The 14\" is a huge serving and I think could easily feed 4 with a side salad or something. Friendly service. Tons of seating for big groups. Next time I'll request the patio as it looked really nice. We'll definitely be ordering from here for our pizza cravings"}, {"review_id": "tSllF0ypimB_YurwrglInA", "user_id": "R7F56STKIjkl2zY_kXDVDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I enjoyed my evening at Sal and Mookies.  First time there, though I had heard about their excellent menu.  I had the Turkey Lurky - best burger I've had.   For an appetizer I tried the fried calamari.  The calamari and fries were well prepared and tasty.  Our server Thomas was very efficient, friendly, and fun.   Love to eat in Jackson, in Fondren, at a cool place like Sal and Mookie's.   #TeamJackson"}, {"review_id": "Y5MwOPQz3shZdYFEl9wkcg", "user_id": "2LbMdTtUaSoV1pTs7tZWuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I ordered the Gambino Stromboli.

With two teenage sons the portions are great for the price. Both boys were full and needed to go boxes. We had the truffle fries as an appetizer-yum! We also ordered a half and half pizza. The waiter came out and advised us that the chef had made a mistake and made a whole pizza of one of the halves we ordered. We were perfectly willing to just take the one pizza, but before we could even say it was ok, the waiter told us they were making it good by making a second pizza. It was a really super gesture.

Mmm! There's a bar to the left which is the chill zone without kids. There's a large dining room and outdoor seating to the right. The icecream bar is to the right too! I don't like it's placement because you have to go far inside the restaurant even if you just want to grab a cone to go. The staff here is kind, and the place is good for many events...
