We opted for the dining room, a beer, goat cheese & jalapeno poppers, and Trailer Trash Zombie burger (double patties). I thought I'd love the goat cheese & jalapeno poppers, but this batch was under-seasoned and watery. The smoky/fruity dipping sauce was interesting! Oh god but the Trailer Trash Zombie Burger = two thin and flavorful meat patties topped with American cheese, fried pickle, chicken fried bacon, cheese curds, ranch dressing. Holy. shit. If you want a novelty and gluttonous burger that actually tastes amazing, get this. As much as I wanted to scarf the whole thing, I'm glad we opted to split it. \"The Walking Ched\" with the mac and cheese patties is next on my list!"}, {"review_id": "sICp-uLWGLPPNVHtvhxjAQ", "user_id": "VxIgcRrT-_KlJNLTKRhYcw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "It's HUGE! They have a walk-up takeout side where you can get one of their crazy shakes to-go, a large patio, and an indoor bar and dining side. The Walking Ched Burger is just as massive. The bun is not a bun, but two GINORMOUS slabs of deep fried mac n cheese! But we're here to have fun not live long! We went on May 4th and they were appropriately playing Star Wars on their TVs. May the 4th be with you, as you try to take on the Ched. The theme was fun, the cocktails are creative. The waitress referred to us as \"fresh meat\" as we hadn't been there before. I would say overall the flavor was lacking, maybe some crazy sauces to help get down all the other goodness!Easy street parking on the edge of mellow Des Moines. We went on a Friday around happy hour and we were still able to find parking just fine. For all the food we got the bill was very affordable!"}, {"review_id": "cB6IuxEGIwaS87l8qxmNRQ", "user_id": "A3GmB-2Wk_WyEH7KweJQsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "This was fun.

Fries! Zombies! Oh my! Zombie Burger has something for everyone. If you are vegan, they have a burger, buns or sauce for that. If you are craving salads, they have that! If you are in the mood for fried, cheese, and huge burgers..well they have endless options for that. Personally this is one of my favorite locations, because they server some pretty good drinks. I like to come here get some fries and a moscow mule and chill. Service is always so nice and witty, so that is nice too.

This place was my first stop after I arrived because of my memories. This place is still as ridiculous and decadent as ever, and the staff remains very energetic and awesome. Today I had the zombie poutine and Walking Ched burger which features two panko-encrusted mac and cheese buns. This meal definitely drove me into a carb coma, but it was worth it. The only things they could improve upon would be making the gravy slightly less salty and the mac and cheese not of the Kraft easy mac variety. Overall, still a very cool place. Would recommend."}, {"review_id": "iNHrXRC5tyWDYgJnq9ALkw", "user_id": "oEqB6qGiV2K3q8g2A8rfYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/27/2017", "text": "Recommended by a friend who lives about an hour away from Des Moines. At first glance the restaurant violated all my sensibilities regarding gimmicky restaurants with gimmicky themes and gimmicky food (yes, not a fan of zombies personally). But I am now officially eating some well-deserved humble pie and stating for a fact that I had a great experience here and really loved the food and yes, even the offensive spiked cereal milkshakes that should not exist (but thank God they do). The rice krispies shake was phenomenal, but just enough liquor that give it a little extra kick and to balance out the cloying sweetness of marshmallow. Had I not been so worried about my cholesterol I would have loved to try their other concoctions.I ordered two appetizers thinking that they must be appetizer-sized so I would need two... big \"mistake\" - both were nearly entree-size for East Coasters. The fried brussel sprouts were super yummy with the two sauces and chicken tenders were made well and not dry at all. My hubby ordered \"The Ched\" with gusto and his eyes nearly popped out of his sockets to see a burger topped with mac 'n cheese... then served between more mac 'n cheese in the form of fried buns. As advised by the bartender, he ate this monstrosity with a fork and knife and was very pleased with the construction of the 'burger' and the balance of textures and flavors.We definitely had to take some food back to our hotel.I highly recommend this restaurant.

As the name implies, the restaurant's theme is primarily zombies, but the menu contains references to other horror movies as well. (I can't remember all of the references or specifically what they were, but there were at least one or two nods to The Human Centipede). The restaurant is decorated with pictures of zombies and even has mannequins made to look like zombies as well. As for the food, I tried the Dawn of the Dead burger, which is basically a bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg and it was pretty good! The server was a pretty cool guy too. I can't remember his name, but he was full of jokes, which made our visit entertaining. I was in Des Moines on a business trip so unfortunately I'm not sure when/if I'll be able to visit this place again, but if my company sends me back here, I'll have to return."}, {"review_id": "b5f87Bl1KHfdQVLkqsX4Jw", "user_id": "e8yoc78LijmnHRycjgkAOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Went with the basic Zombie Burger.

Weird.I was very surprised at their lack of gluten free options. She was able to get her burger on a bed of lettuce, but there was literally not one side she was able to order other than another salad.She said hers was delicious, mine was just ok (Sarah's Revenge) and the Bleu Cheese Garlic Fries were a disappointment.

All of the food was delicious. The burger was juicy. The veggie one was so heavy but ahh-mazing and the fries were perfectly crispy. The decor of this place is really cool too. Decorated like its namesake (zombies and walking dead esque) and their menus looked like newspaper. I highly recommend this place for anyone in the area.

I was impressed!Food: salad was so so, I can't really recall anything out of the norm about it. The burger I chose was the The Walking Ched which is the craziest burger I've had thus far. I couldn't even eat half of it. I don't think I was expecting so much Mac and cheese but it's right in the description! Good gimmick burger but wouldn't order it a second time. The burger my friend got, The Raygun, was an excellent burger. I would order that one again. The guacamole was fresh and the burger was well cooked. So overall I like this place.

The food is ok. They do have burgers that are Des Moines themed and have fun toppings that you won't find other places, but nothing so special that I feel the need to go here over anywhere else, unless suggested by someone else. The service is fine, the food is fine, but that's not what makes restaurants special. If you go here, I'd recommend the trailer trash burger, though my friends swear by the Elvis burger which has both peanut butter and a fried egg. Where they truely shine is the shakes. They make them with alcohol or without and if you have some extra money you're willing to part with, I'd definitely recommend one of those (especially the cereal ones).Overall, I find this place overpriced for the quality of food, but if you have the money and want to clog your arteries for a bit, I wouldn't turn you away."}, {"review_id": "kQwig1ZVW5fsm8CTBQ8a7A", "user_id": "AkLT--PhIh_4ags8AC6ZeA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Super fun menu with lots of great combos.
