Now that I'm living in Columbus again, I find out that they have a nice downstairs restaurant? Every day has a set of 4 or 5 lunch specials available only on that day, which really appeals to me. I sat at the bar and the service was quick & friendly. I had the spinach & ricotta stuffed ravioli in marinara. It came out relatively quickly, and was pretty good. I mean, it's not going to rival a good Italian place with homemade sauce & pasta from scratch, but I enjoyed it. I also ordered a slice of apple pie, which was huge, covered in caramel and absolutely delicious. Probably one of the best pieces of apple pie I've ever had. My only complaint is that the pricing of the desserts compared to the meals seems disproportionate. My lunch was $9.99 but my apple pie was $8.50."}, {"review_id": "oFJMlBIkN-HVi4kC0XZIhA", "user_id": "XyKNOKaNEqnePHNxxt20Og", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Overpriced.  Pretentious.  Lousy attitudes of staff interacting with customers.  The cheddar grits were horrible -- and this be the SOUTH, folks !"}, {"review_id": "1IEnxkOrFriDsbqFC2WhWA", "user_id": "cESQWIGJHMA4pvvrX2ZOPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "First time here and we had a wonderful family lunch.

I haven't gotten my entree yet but already I'm impressed. The buffalo dip and the house chips with house French onion dip were all yummy and tasted homemade. But the best part so far has been our wonderful server Madison. She changed our table twice to accommodate my husband watching the NBA finals. She's just been so polite and attentive. Yes, it is loud but we expected that. It's a bar/ restaurant/ jazz joint. I have no complaints so far So the food was really good. My husband had the steak, and I had the pork chop. Both were season and cooked perfectly. I highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "jFkeXrrjqSuw8xCpBA9K0Q", "user_id": "swR-uvvCVpjdW7SvcWC33Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "I enjoyed the atmosphere, a nice spot to bring a date.  The food was ok,  typical is the best word I can use to describe.  My wife had the southwestern salad which was very good.  I had the steak -  it was very large but I had to use A1 :("}, {"review_id": "Th4YP4E7EV4cUUhmTvkVrQ", "user_id": "bDTirPzfGCPNy6euy5U1-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Excellent steak restaurant.

This place is awesome. Just the ambiance , the live music, the drinks , the bartenders . The food is fantastic , I ordered the ribeye steak and it was amazing. I went to the upstairs portion of the joint. That is where the stage is. I just felt very comfortable here. The prices are more than the other places in the area. But you get what you pay for.

I love the service, they make you feel upbeat and ready to eat and drink lol the mahi mahi was exquisite, pork chops we're out if this world, but the prime rib I have to say was the best with a whopping 16oz piece of meat, and the desert is Flintstone size and very delightful!

Have not been here in over a year and now less impressive. Tried to make reservations as Yelp says they take then. Was told no, just go on a \"call ahead\" list. Atmosphere is extremely noisy, if more than two at a table then no conversation.  Used to get free house made chips, but apparently not anymore.  Our server was very attentive and did not ignore us. Entrees were fair, but overpriced when no bread or chips served. Raviolis were warm and served with grilled chicken breast that had no taste and was dry. The mac and cheese was also served warm. The crab cakes were good, but overall will not be on our list to return soon. Just like many other places now, big on noise and drinks and forget how to serve decent, tasty and hot food."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-loft-columbus-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
