Personally, I think it's over hyped, overpriced, and not nearly as good as a few of their competitors. With that said, feel free to take my review with a grain of salt.Wife, kiddos, and I came in late on a Tuesday during the Christmas season. The place was disgustingly filthy, which I've never experienced this at their Weinbach, or Newburgh locations. (They've always offered a very clean restaurant, with great service.) We waited awhile to be seated, even though there wasn't a wait. I'd understand, if they were cleaning, but with the food party that was still on the floor, this apparently wasn't the case...For an app, we ordered bread sticks, with cheese and pizza sauce. $1.50 *each* for pizza, and cheese sauce!? So, basically, I ordered $8 bread sticks, which sucked, by the way. To be fair, the cheese sauce was very good. At $1.50 \"add on\" it damn well better taste good. My son ordered a simple cheese pizza. I sampled it, and it was good (far from great). Wife and I split a Stromboli. It was good, but again, not nearly as good as their competition. And, when did a strom become so thin, and what's up with the skimping of toppings? Come on Turoni's, I'm all for capitalism, and hefty profits, but please don't cheat me !Beer. Yep, this is why you come to Turoni's. They have their own in-house brew master, and years later, I still believe they serve some of the best craft beers out there. The beer, oddly enough, is reasonably priced.My advice- sit at the bar, as they do have a very nice, dark bar with a cool ambience. Have a few craft beers, and order food with the understanding that you're paying a premium price, for mediocre food."}, {"review_id": "CKybOzZWDM17MFfTTE5rwQ", "user_id": "30Jl9T5UAIg5i8UMrsyjUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "Best friends are from Evansville and we always hear about the pizza here!  Really thin crust which I love!"}, {"review_id": "x3HZk94v4MmoUb_p3TuBvw", "user_id": "7eG5YVTdNbMf6W34K7Zb4g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "Went here after an event with a large group of people. The servers were great. The garlic cheese bread was delicious - soft bread, mozzarella, lots of butter flavor. We ordered s handful of pizzas, including the Greek, the Veggie Delight, and one with artichokes and mushrooms, along with some meat ones that I didn't try. All of them were great, especially the Greek pizza and the artichoke pizza! I'm usually not a fan of cracker-style crust pizzas but this was a good example of the style! The crust wasn't so brittle it just snapped, the pizzas had the right amount of cheese, and the toppings were plentiful. The beer was good too. I enjoyed the Bulldog IPA, which wasn't overly hoppy but had a nice bite."}, {"review_id": "X1jsMJRDiQwnH-aAgeFRxA", "user_id": "8DaCBO-ZOWdW80qzOaXn2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "I live in Indianapolis and for weeks was looking forward to getting a veggie dream when visiting family in Evansville.

Speaking of not worth the price, we started the night with an order of breadsticks and what we received were hollow bread shells. They were not worth the four dollars and change and on top of that it was a buck and a half or so for cheese to go with it. My wife had a craft beer and only finished half of it.

I ask so you are going to take it back and put it in the oven again and she says no I was going to put them on the side. WT_ is she thinking. The manager comes over to see what is wrong and offers to make another pizza now by then I have eaten four pieces and lunch is over. I just want you to not charge me for onions that I didn't get.

Her suggestion was echoed by every local I spoke to today, so we decided that it simply couldn't be ignored. We sat ourselves in the Bar area (21+) and were immediately greeted by our server who was quick to point out the highlights of their 6 locally crafted beers, and let us know what menu items were popular favorites. Our order came out much faster than expected, and I have to say that I've not had many pizzas that can compare! The thin crust was nice and firm, there was an abundance of cheese, and the toppings were evenly spread over the square-cut pie. My only criticism is that there were a few places where the amount of sauce was a little overwhelming. Overall, an amazing pizza for a very reasonable price. I also ordered a house salad with the house Italian dressing, and it was far better than most standard generic salad fare I've come to expect from smaller family establishments. The lettuce was romaine, and all of the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The included pepperonis made for a super tasty topping that added some hearty sustenance to the dish. Overall, everything about this place impressed me. The atmosphere is casual, the menu was hand-drawn had a decent variety of bar fare, bathroom was very clean, and the staff was kind and attentive. I will definitely be back if I am ever back in Evansville."}, {"review_id": "1B_dIdhIFSZ9TlwFeTTUsQ", "user_id": "sWckYv3GNGpQ-bciG87mZQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "We visited this place on New Year's Eve, 20 of us, had reservations.

We gave up and decided to sit separate from our group in the bar area since they kept telling us they were waiting for a couple to leave in the dining area to push our tables together. I understand 20 people is a lot, but reservations were made and we were told an hour wait. When we finally sat down, not everyone got their drinks and our pizza was late (while everyone else had chewed down their pizzas).

A local pizza establishment with three locations, they've cornered the pizza market with their decidingly paper-thin cracker crust.Their location on Main St is the original: a true brick and mortar with a mural on the outside telling their customers to \"follow the yellow brick road.\" The building is actually split in three: Take out, 21+, and Family.Lets break down their pizza.Cracker crust:Beyond thin pizza base with minimal rise in the dough.Yes the crust is thin, but don't be fooled; this is no true thin crust pizza. But don't let that discourage you as its delicious nonetheless. Slightly chewy and not so firm, you can't pick this up easily: two hands required open face, one hand folded. Beware toppings overload, the crust can get soggy. Napkins required.Sweet sauce:Roma tomato base, heavily oregano, brown sugar, with a umami afterthought from worcestershire/anchovy paste. The sauce is fairly sweet for my taste, but its made up for with the burst of the roma. Reminiscent of fast food pizza, but upgraded on quality.Cheese: A mix between cheddar, mozzarella & monterrey jack cheese; very consistent between pizzas. Fairly standard across the board, so I don't have too much to compliment or complain. A touch of provolone could probably help add to help firm up the cheese, but its not needed!Toppings: This is where Turoni's truly shines!House special: Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Onion, Mushrooms, Green peppers, black olives, Pepperoncini's & tomatoes. My absolute favorite of theirs. The Italian sausage is perfectly spiced and richly fat, which adds some nice depth. 10/10.LOTS*A*MEAT: Italian Sausage, ground beef, pepperoni, ham & bacon. The ham and bacon is a great touch to add saltiness to the pizza. Ground beef adds a lot of moisture however, which lends to a soggier crust. 7/10.Veggie House Special: Onions, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, pepperoncini's and tomatoes. Lacks the depth of fats I really like in my pizza, but fine option if you don't eat meat. 7/10.Cheeszy-Cheez: Cheddar, mozzarella & monterrey jack cheese on top of the normal cheddar, mozzarella & monterrey jack cheese. Hey, if you like cheese this is your go-to. 8/10.Buffalo Chicken: Buffalo sauce, chicken, monterrey jack & mozzarella cheese w/ranch dressing dip. For you new-age topping lovers, this will hit the spot. 8/10.Beer:Turoni's, while mostly known for their pizza, is also a small brewery! Fairly decent, and priced well. They have two beers always on-tap, with multiple rotating in and out. Pick your favorite style and they're sure to have it on tap (sorry sour lovers, you're out of luck).Overall, Turoni's is definitely worth a try!"}, {"review_id": "Mcf4YW7ATtnw8-cq7xZgfQ", "user_id": "f4EYhOr4wpBy2cGdZIUJuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "Turoni's is an Evansville staple. I remember going there as a kid and it was one of the few places where the kids and adults were equally excited. Their pizza is thin crust, the sauce is robust and plentiful, and the topping selection is exactly perfect. They have their own micro-brewery on site, and their beer tastes perfectly crafted to compliment their pizza (and so maybe it is). The environment is old world and cozy, something that I miss as more and more restaurants move towards the uber minimalist, sterilized motif. Moving away, and especially being 7 months pregnant, I can't tell you how many times I've longed for a medium veggie pizza precluded by garlic cheez toast.
