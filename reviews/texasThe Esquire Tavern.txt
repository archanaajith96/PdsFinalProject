So glad to experience some history in beautiful San Antonio Ranch. They have 100 foot bar and several very private booths for dining. The menu had a variety of great selections, including vegetarian fares. My brother had the empanada and loved it, warning, it is very hot! My dad had the chile relleno and he said he could have eaten 2 more, he was thoroughly satisfied. The menu is seasonal, which is always a neat concept! Price is reasonable for a tourist spot but dad picked up the bill so I'm not certain what the final price was. Cons: The menu is seasonal which can be a pain in the butt if you go right before they change the menu, which was exactly our case, so none of the hardy vegetarian dishes were available (The roasted root salad or the Cauliflower curry). I ended up ordering the shrimp toast, it had really good flavor but it was deep fried (Not RD approved) and the shrimp was in mouse form. I was disappointed that I didn't have more vegetarian options besides a plain house salad. Having said that all the flavors were on point."}, {"review_id": "yhECDAMJ6lLcfV_4P9wEyA", "user_id": "c2LshhyPmgxmmY7udinE_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Awesome place!

Service was awesome and my waitress was super nice and very open when I asked for her suggestions. Instead of immediately telling me what her favorite was she took the time to ask me questions about what I liked, which was great as it helped me get the best drink possible. Drinks here are STRONG. Boozy booze y'all. The only downside was the dish. I ordered shrimp toast based off Yelp and man, that was so not awesome. I chalk the reviews up to maybe being drunk, because the description is not what arrived either. It says it's a shrimp mousse but it's chunks of shrimp and not even that many pieces. The dish is basically funnel cake with bits of shrimp and if you're drinking I bet that sounds awesome. If you are sober it's a greasy gut bomb and I'd highly avoid this dish and instead try the deviled eggs or pimento cheese sandwich. Even with the dish I recommend this bar because it's full of history and superb staff."}, {"review_id": "ssq48Xx3z8w-7VG0nLPWyQ", "user_id": "9GSCIsyoTXYI_oWQzDCjPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "4/5Good beer and burgers spot on the Riverwalk. I came here for lunch. This is not a tourist trap, like other restaurants in the area!! Nice selection of cocktails and local craft beer. Fried pickles are a MUST. They pickle all their vegetables in house, and it sure makes a big difference. The batter was nicely seasoned. The Bison Burger and the Bacon Cheeseburger were very very good. The meat was incredibly well seasoned. The bun was particularly nice and toasted and there was just enough cheese. Pro tip: save one fried pickle per burger and slide it between the bun and the patty. It's a game changer!! Only downside is neither includes pickles-- to add it's $1 extra.The chili salt fries were meh. The chili seasoning can be overpowering if you don't love chili. I sat outside with a view right on the riverwalk and the inside looked like a nice tavern. Service was decent, our waiter was knowledgeable of the dishes and drinks. Overall, GREAT burger and beer spot! Some of the tastiest burgers I've tried!!"}, {"review_id": "Bj7N4x1ul1QD4RVVr1qRag", "user_id": "w8VCb5PfOiD4thmpBqTybw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Super cute spot!!

Our boat driver/tour guide mentioned that the Esquire was the oldest bar in the city, so we knew we had to check it out. After the tour, we moseyed our way back to where Esquire's located. We accidentally came through the back entrance, and were honestly concerned we walked into a closed bar. The bar is very dimly lit, and it's difficult to navigate if you come through the wrong entrance like us. We made our way to the front of the bar, and found what is the longest bar in the United States. (Disclaimer: I don't know if that's true, but my inebriated extinct as well as a fellow bar-crawler told me so. Looking around, the layout is simple so if you come in the street level entrance, it's going to be a lot easier to find where you need to go.My friend and I ordered a cocktail and a beer, and were pleasantly surprised by how large the drink menu was. They even had a champagne that her boyfriend is obsessed with so we had to come back the next day!I can't say anything for the food, but the ambiance and the drinks were great. The service was a-okay, not very present, but I was with my friends and didn't want to be bothered too much anyway. Definitely a cool, off the beaten path but still around bar to hit up in San Antonio."}, {"review_id": "WPYkHSrrnFV1q03KUqWg3g", "user_id": "EBHXdckHPXwpLNzUzKPlpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "The best bacon burger in 1932!!!

The empanada was small, and to be honest, not very flavorful. The chili relleno was actually pretty good. If you absolutely have to eat here, try that. Good portion and pretty tasty with their own twist on a classic recipe. Our server was friendly. If it wasn't for the chili relleno and our friendly server, we would have given the place one star.On a side note, they sat us at the end by the rear entrance, where they stored all the high chairs.

Typically, I don't order M&C at restaurants since it's usually dry and tasteless but their version is delicious, and I finished the whole cup.Bf got the bison burger with chili salt fries.

It was busy and loud, with a decent amount of customers. Service was slow, and our waiter seemed a bit overwhelmed. Started with drinks. The wife ordered a glass of wine, and I had a stout. Both were good. For lunch I chose the meatloaf melt. OK flavor, but too greasy and busy for me. There were veggies on the side, and they were pickled carrots and cauliflower. Couldn't tell if the intent was to serve them cold or warm. The temperature was in- between. I did not care for them. The wife had  a bun-less Burger (she is gluten intolerant) and the onion soup. The bowl of soup was huge. We ordered a second drink, and this time I chose a bloody Mary. I was told they had just sold the last one and would have to choose something else. Luckily, they still had the stout on tap. What Bar in this country can you go to and not get a bloody Mary?  Overall, service was ***, food **, drinks **, price *, and total experience **. Rounded up for this review.  This lunch was by far the most expensive meal we have had during our trip to Texas, and also the least memorable."}, {"review_id": "BY816rdcUQueFt2I0zJjdg", "user_id": "BhcKwM-DTXjgCgZs1ILvkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "If you're in San Antonio, this bar must be visited!

We had originally planned on going somewhere else, but none of us wanted to pay cover. One of the group suggested this place, and I'm glad she did.I called ahead and made a reservation based on the advice of other Yelpers. The wait allowed us time to wander around and chat. They also texted me to confirm the reservation and when the table was ready, which I really liked. My friend who has been here before warned us that this place does not skimp on their drinks!Our waiter was great. We were seated at 6:30 and we were able to review the menu and get our happy hour orders in on time. I had a Twentieth Century and a cider. I'm glad I listened to my friend, because the cocktail did not disappoint. There are several other drinks that look fantastic. They have a lot of classics, but also several specialty drinks. They also have a wide selection of wine and beer.Food wise, I had the deviled eggs and split the fried pickles and fries with the table. I enjoyed the food.The atmosphere is kinda dark and would be great for date night. It did get very, very crowded and our waiter was stretched a little thin.
