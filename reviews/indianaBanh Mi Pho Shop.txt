You can find this gem off Fairfield across from Shigs. They have a private parking lot so finding spot is easy! The interior is nothing spectacular but they have ample seating and adorable succulents hanging. I also love the bar seating that looks out the windows! The staff is always super friendly, explains items if you have questions and on top of it! I know that if I am stopping in over the lunch hour I won't be pressed for time. My favorite is the chicken pho or pork egg noodles. They always tastes fresh and are loaded with flavor. The avocado bubble tea is to die for!If you haven't already, you need to get your pho on here!"}, {"review_id": "QlaGbDP4Uf-T6wjyOzXb5g", "user_id": "NQ0I-KBYKL7AOJXNJsaJxQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I really enjoyed our trip here.  First off I was impressed at how well the restaurant presented its facilities and dining room.  All were well maintained and clean.  Nothing fancy here.  Just good Pho.The staff was very friendly.  There were very helpful from the time you order at the desk to the follow up on refills and just at checking in on you.We started with the spring rolls.  They were very fresh, large and tasty.  The peanut sauce was not sweet like most.  It was a little thin also.  The egg roll was nicely done.  The filling was very tasty with a nice blend of vegetables and meat.  The shell was lightly fried - not greasy.My wife had the Vietnamese salad.  The chicken was moist and tasty.  The salad was very fresh and well presented.  The salad dressing was very light and accented the salad with a Vietnamese flavor.  I had the beef Pho.  The beef was moist and nicely flavored.  The broth was delicious!!Overall the experience was very good.  This place has a very small menu.  If you need more variety then you will be disappointed.  This would be a great place to introduce someone to Pho if they have never had it.  Give it a try!!"}, {"review_id": "yZqcSXmvoAY9VG6wT5N-3A", "user_id": "JC_uxHSMlzz7mNiPKwdxXA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I stopped here on my way back to Indy. It's a lovely local establishment that has a more modern take on Vietnamese cuisine. If you are looking for more traditional vegetarian Vietnamese dishes, this would not be a good option. However, the flavors were great. I ordered the vegetarian rice noodle dish and a side of vegetarian spring rolls. Both came with sliced avocado, lots of veggies, and a few slabs of lightly soy sauce-marinated tofu. Essentially, they had the same ingredients but slightly different presentations, so I was a little bummed about that (even though they were both very good). These dishes came with an interesting peanut sauce. I'm not sure how they make this, but the sauce was slightly tangy and very sticky, which is not very traditional. Prices are very reasonable, and I'm extremely happy at the number of vegetarian items on the menu. They even have a vegetarian banh mi! Unheard of and all the more reason to come back."}, {"review_id": "MYPeJLsSYizgunkuyPyWTQ", "user_id": "ku22MtUUexmvtzXKvJmt4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "Had to try this place out after being a long time fan of the original shop Banh Mi Barista. Liking the upgrade of bigger menu, bigger inviting dining area, and bigger free parking space. Still same casual family vibe and friendly service.They have ramen once a week here (not at other location) and almost always sell out. The chef must like to experiment because it's different each time. Last time i saw it was a ribeye ramen. I also spied one of my favorite dishes, the rice pork chop dish. However i opted to get the Viet special sandwich without spicy just to get a baseline comparison. The bread is different and personally i think better than the original. It's more crunchier and more authentic to the banh mi. Sandwich tasted great but next time I'll have to ask for no soy sauce because it was almost too salty for me but probably fine for most people. The avo smoothie was just as delish as always! (I promise I'll get something other than avo next time lol).Make sure to take a tour and look at the art. The chalk mural in the back looks so neat. And i really liked the Vietnam travel board that you can see what the manager/owner? did during her stay. It's a personal touch that i appreciate."}, {"review_id": "jzoqrjkyGoEka4F7b4ZJjg", "user_id": "rddAj9WzPYSWEyrQiniRiQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "This was amazing and great taste, really recommend the Ramen pork. Only issue I would have to complain about is that it needed a hint of lime/lemon added to it over all the veggies and the pork and with the egg was outstanding the taste was so mouth warming with that hint of something else."}, {"review_id": "7pWPUl5ahW__BfA2vqWFqQ", "user_id": "K5vA58EvuN87CQbuRBCiaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "Pho-ing amazing. I have been a long time fan of Banh Mi Barista, and knew I had to try Banh Mi Pho Shop (same family owners). The decor is very nice and the space feels updated! I loved the succulents hanging in the dining area!! Space is more spacious than the location on Coldwater and plenty of parking. We arrived just before noon and there was a short line in front of us - then the place got packed around 12:15! Definitely a new favorite lunch spot for downtown employees. Located off Fairfield but just a second from the heart of Downtown - it is sure to be a hot spot during lunch hours.I went for my go-to: beef pho and pork and shrimp spring rolls. Amazing. As always. The broth is so tasty you don't feel compelled to add all the spicy sauces....but I still do after eating half of it how it originally comes. We also tried the Korean BBQ sandwich - can't beat the price @ $5 and it is super filling! Spring rolls and egg rolls are some of my favorites in the city.They have an extensive list of bubble teas and are known for them! I love the coffee flavor. Definitely check this place out! Service is great!"}, {"review_id": "03MdfpCoEOqthMdsgKzkDQ", "user_id": "2V1Y6F6_AkLx6P8R_bBn7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "Coworkers & I decided on this place for lunch, for a new tradition we like to call \"It's PHO-king Friday!\". Love this place - way better overall than their other location on Coldwater Road! This location is larger & more inviting, has better service & the food even tastes better. I tried the Beef Pho, per the recommendation of many Yelpers, and it was so good! I haven't really had a lot of Pho before, so I was thrown off when they asked if I wanted my beef cooked or not. I'm not sure what the uncooked beef would be like, so if you're unsure what to say when asked this (like I was), go with cooked! I got this as takeout, (the packaging was a little strange), along with the Chicken Banh Mi Sandwich. Both were very delicious, although I may order the \"spicy\" version of the sandwich next time, to add a little extra kick. I felt that the Beef Pho was perfect as is, and I didn't need to add anything to spruce it up! I'd also like to add that I am very impressed with the service here. The cashier who was taking orders (seemed more like a manager though) was doing the dang thing! She was very helpful, triple checked all our orders, and even helped us carry our food out to the car - now that's service! Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "zR179g9zBb14FeU9rk4paA", "user_id": "ssSNHhoYz0MO_lFZ6o493w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Best lunch I've had in Fort Wayne!

The beef ramen was $14-15, and the noodles were overcooked and I'm pretty sure they were instant noodles, not fresh. For the cost, I expect fresh ramen noodles. Other than the noodles, the ramen was pretty good. The broth had a curry-like flavor that I liked, and the veggies and egg helped make up for the noodle quality.2. The spring rolls were partially frozen when they came to our table. The filling was crunchy from being frozen. I realize that these are pre-made and not made-to-order, but come on. You can do better. Also, the dipping sauce was a watery hoisin-style sauce, not a peanut sauce.PRO1. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy his beef pho and it looked pretty good. He also liked his bubble tea.Considering we paid more than $30 for mostly below-average food, I don't think it's worth the Yelp hype.

But honestly, that's my only complaint. I ordered the vegetarian noodle bowl which was delectable. The noodles were perfectly cooked, not stuck together, and the vegetables were super fresh. I like that they serve the sauce on the side, however, I just dumped the whole thing in there and mixed it all up!
