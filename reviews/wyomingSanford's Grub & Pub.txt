Every single thing is huge, from the menu to the portions to the silverware. The walls are covered with decor and there are several TVs--it's definitely a good place to post up for a game.The drink list is extensive and they have several Colorado beers, which is a plus when visiting from out of town. When your food comes, prepare to wonder how to even begin...once you manage to stuff whatever eight decker sandwich you ordered into your mouth, you'll be pretty pleased. It's not the very best food I've had, but it's good and I've never had a bad meal here. The onion rings are a favorite of mine!Service was really good the last time I was here and the prices are decent, especially when you consider that one meal should keep you fed for a day or two!"}, {"review_id": "PsGlAw7x6mjHLM3Ae3ICNw", "user_id": "0GlZ4Fz6OQZz2Y9a_fOIAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I am beside myself it's the food here!  I had the Arkansas Asskicker Steak.  I replaced the sirloin with ribeye.  It's smothered with sautéed mushrooms, onions, chopped jalapeños and crab meat.  It comes with a side salad which was exceptional, with shaved carrot and watermelon radishes and red onion and cherry tomatoes with choice of dressing and a slice of garlic bread. The entree comes with deep fried sourdough roll and cinnamon honey butter.  Choice of potato, I had the Cajun fries and one side, which I picked black eyed peas.  Monkey was my bartender and server.  Very nice guy and very good at his job.  Sit at the bar when he's working.  I will be back for sure."}, {"review_id": "lX8ZRJo01ch6RG8wng0COg", "user_id": "_mJ88EPLlkFMXG7kCoHqFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Food was cooked perfectly.Our bartender Larry was absolutely amazing!

Don't know local laws, and know distribution can be weird, but was sad to learn none of the local Cheyenne beers were on tap. Bummer. They did have several Wyoming beers, but the bartender didn't know beer basics and made my wife a poorly done cocktail. The ambiance is really fun and whimsical but the staff on our visit was lackluster. The menu looks fun & tasty - and the food I saw come out looked pretty well done."}, {"review_id": "W04knQajMrmXMLOX6Keugg", "user_id": "GS5kblDDexnzOPNF7otcag", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Holy cow, we've been sitting for an hour and 30 mins!   Will not be back any time soon."}, {"review_id": "tjx_l8BtMA8mB6mj6trICw", "user_id": "iLPRUAQxnFOBnubmw_Ewkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/1/2017", "text": "My husband and I enjoyed this place alot!Great service,  huuuugggeee portions, inexpensive, and it had really cool vintage decor.

We were seated at a high rable and they brought us a very high high chair that consisted of THREE high chairs stacked, I strongly questioned that but it turned out alright. The menu is huge!

This place is packed with all sorts of crazy memorabilia and random nicknacks. I have been here several times and the food always surpasses my expectations. They also have a very large assortment of beer on draft, which is something that lured me here, to begin with. I had tried many of their burgers and they have all been delicious. If you want to try something new for a side, try and Freddies. It's basically a massive potato that has been cut, lengthwise, into about four pieces then battered and fried. They have a huge menu and huge proportions so don't worry about leaving here without leftovers for lunch the next day."}, {"review_id": "jGQMBO2DMKy-LVkfAuxKYg", "user_id": "eEx_rkxTT8dVkkB110IEoQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/26/2017", "text": "This place has character, there is so much to look at.
