We were given one of those buzzers that tell you when your table is ready. Our wait was about 15 minutes as it was a Sunday afternoon past lunch time.MAI TAI = $12.00, very sweet and poured out of bottle, no fresh taste. No body can beat Monkeypod, though. I'm forever spoiled by Monkeypod. The tiki head glass is cute, where can I buy that?CALAMARI = $15. More like calamari strips with a \"smear\" of sauce on the side, which kinda looked gross. Smear, really? The calamari was chewy and almost rubbery. The panko was on the heavier side. No body beats Haleiwa Beach House's calamari. Nobody.DUKE'S NACHOS = $14. No discount for getting a veggie version without the meat. Standard nacho stuff, nothing special.CRISPY CHICKEN BLT = $15.50. Husband said it was a 4 out of 5 stars.SERVICE = 5/5...really nice guy! The service upped the star from a three to a four. I used to love Duke's but the food quality has changed and it's become more expensive, understandably, due to time, but where are my standard favorites, like the awesome fries they use to have? The buffet looked totally unremarkable, so I didn't go for that. Lucky thing I carbo-loaded at Marukame Udon before coming here!"}, {"review_id": "BHeoMeBzqiHMY4wpmRoS6A", "user_id": "5Cz9qifAxr-pWXvxEciWuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Stopped by Duke's for a quick drink. This place is pretty cool, as it is right on the beach. I had a standard gin and soda, was charged around $7 for it. Not bad. My friend had a cocktail - a lava flow, which was rum, with coconut and strawberry juice. It was delicious. That'll run you about $10.

My parents and I ordered the ribs, quesadilla and wings. I was too excited and started eating the food before I took a photo. The Baby. Back. Ribs... They are a MUST-TRY!! The meat literally falls off the bone and it is so tender, it melts in your mouth. The bbq sauce is so delicious my dad asked for more so he could dip the ribs in. The quesadilla and wings are also so good! The salsa and guacamole are really fresh. The service is rocking! The servers were all so nice and would check up on us (especially because we kept ordering more). The live music and view make for a very nice evening out."}, {"review_id": "2xLaszBCztwy0bZfzQ8NCg", "user_id": "6pVA4eE356R2Q6eXV0Umug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Well, this place is a must for anyone vacationing the island or at lease Waikiki. This place is right next to the beach, and walking distance to many hotels, luckily my hotel was just a short crawling distance to this place. I mean Waikiki Beach is overcrowded especially during peak season. I was here couple of Decembers ago; the beach was packed. The place was packed, but since I checked in solo, I got me a singles table overlooking the beach I had the perfect view, with my tank top, glasses, and shorts. I went during their breakfast buffet, and I loved it. They have couple of selections from eggs, to meats, to rice, to fruits- it was awesome morning. The staffs were welcoming. The price was not cheap though. I'd come here again when I visit the Island."}, {"review_id": "ZFbdejTomGlKNZXCUVKeyA", "user_id": "i5Ssj6oUIQtq8-uEcpLvDw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Funny Story: we requested and received an outdoor, beach-facing table.  Meanwhile, Hawaii is notorious for temperamental weather. Just as my loaded nachos were arriving, the sunny skies gave way to dark storm clouds, and rain began POURING down on the entire restaurant. EVERYONE in the restaurant rushed inside for cover - everyone except for one man. Standing under a table umbrella, I desperately stuffed nachos into my mouth before the rain and mother nature ruined them. Restaurant patrons watched in surprise, and my wife was mortified. I got my money's worth.--Mediocre food, great views and vibe. This is a place for tourists in Honolulu. Like Duke's in Malibu, California, the food skews to your standard American diner classics - burgers and fries, loaded nachos, etc. I recommend requesting an outdoor, ocean-facing table - that's really this place's saving grace and what will make the wait worthwhile. Watch out for rain."}, {"review_id": "cjYJdR8ILJ3ipbmJgTnVZg", "user_id": "av29hHTIYR3LgtljozyqzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Duke's Waikiki is a great place to come for food and drinks in Waikiki, with great food, even better drinks, and reasonable prices, you'll have great time here.We came to Duke's to have a fun dinner with friends. Uber-ing from the Hilton, we were seated in about 15 min and enjoyed a fantastic table, literally right by the beach. Ordering items like the Chicken sandwich, the fish tacos, and the cheeseburger, we had our food in about 20 minutes (really fast).  The food was excellent, and the service was fast and fantastic. The best part of Dukes is the drinks. We ordered several drinks (I suggest the Mai Tai), they were really good and good sized as well. One thing you should know is that the food menu here is quite limited. Although it's a bar-food menu, it's the best bar food I've ever had, but if you're looking for large plates of fancy food, you won't find it here. I think this is part of their success though. A simple menu makes fast service easier, and Dukes is rocket fast. Overall, it was a fun night with great food and everyone had a great time. 4 Stars."}, {"review_id": "cHH3eZEgea1s1nffZoMDgw", "user_id": "T-k9ioVv-8laNEyMYQ_jVw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "The view is nice, but there are many restaurants/bars along Waikiki that also have nice views as well. Not sure why this place is so famous.If you want a formal dining experience, you get a table inside the dining area. If you want a more casual dining experience, walk outside toward the beach area and get a number there. Slightly different menus too. We opted for the more casual area.The food was average. Got the burger with mango salsa and the fish tacos as the waitress recommended. Nothing special. The tacos were kinda dry and the burger was good but nothing to write home about.Our waitress was friendly and nice.

Its huge so have someone to share it with.  I always ask for extra hot fudge.

Valet parking here is $6 for every 30 minutes, or you can go to outrigger ohana east about a 6 minute walk away and pay $6 for four hours with validation.  The lunch buffet was okay.  I think I would have liked the breakfast one better.  There was a pasta bar, fruits and salads and a couple entrees.  The buffet area is smaller than average.  There were no drinks or desserts included for lunch.  I think my favorite entrees were the kalua pork with cabbage and the teriyaki chicken.  I didn't care for the fish stew or the make your own pasta grill.  I think the employees can make or break this place.  The server who brought us to our table was super friendly and talkative, but our server was late to work and  a little too abrupt for me.  The guy at the pasta bar was not friendly at all.  I was kind of sad since this is Waikiki on my home island.  When I visited Maui a couple of months ago, every server at every restaurant we went to was so full of aloha.  I would come back, but only to try their breakfast buffet, not for lunch."}, {"review_id": "Eh4nmze__O7CRFyTvWBGGA", "user_id": "6ClUVy4VB1WofBvH5cb5_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My hubby and I decided to grab coffee and dessert one night and scored a table on the back patio close to the water.  Our goal that night was to indulge in the Hula Pie and warm our bodies up with some hot coffee to offset the cold dessert.  Hula Pie.  Two words to remember the next time you're in Waikiki.  Dukes has been making it for a long time and even has their own plates to serve it on.  It's an Oreo crust, topped with a vanilla macadamia nut ice cream, topped with a chocolate ganache.  Layered on top of that is whipped cream, crush macadamia nuts and it's nestled in a bed of warm chocolate syrup.  It's heavenly, sinful and decadent.  Definitely worth checking out for a late night dessert when your legs give out from walking all day.  Yum!"}, {"review_id": "8VPc4L3zU4txHE1IqYzLxQ", "user_id": "Auph-6XZF2IBcsO0pjkBCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Aloha.!
