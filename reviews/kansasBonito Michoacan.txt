You know it's going be good when you order in English and the employee struggles to understand you. I really really wish I knew Spanish! Anyone have tips on how they learned Spanish?Anyway, back to the food. The street tacos were some of the best I've had in the area. The meat comes folded in two tasty corn tortillas and are filled to the brim with meat. You can add onion and cilantro (a must in my opinion), and they have a variety of sauces. I contemplated giving this place 4/5 because their meat selection was running low, but that was my fault, not theirs. I came in later in the evening. I view this as a sign that they have a lot of customers and that I'm onto something good. If you want a better selection I'd recommend coming earlier in the day. We got there around 7:30-8pm. Don't worry, I'm coming back for you barbacoa! The restaurant is located in a shopping market, so it's likely that you'll catch a whiff of the butchers meat in the back. It wasn't a pleasant smell, to say the least. All this adds to my satisfaction because it's what I imagine walking into if I were to get the same thing in South America. Was I worried about montezuma's revenge? Absolutely. Luckily it didn't come forme! Was it worth it even if it did? Yep.I'll be back."}, {"review_id": "HweyTfPS79ISa_i_MQ1SuA", "user_id": "3EnqiM5UljXyKET1-H8S6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "This is a great place to eat. They have a good range of dishes that you can choose from. The food is always very good and is a very authentic Mexican food. The price is very intact with what you are receiving. The seats and tables are kind of uncomfortable but that okay because the food is so delicious you will eat it very quickly and won't need to be sitting for for long. They also have a mini grocery store so if you need something quick you can also grab it here. They kind of have limited parking so that might also be an issue but other than that, I would definitely recommend this place to eat!"}, {"review_id": "luFdWF9W-O58zSFhdMuv1A", "user_id": "FnObzdzxUyTJql_3NlBtXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "Our new running joke for this spot is; cuatro or cinco tacos as we just love everything here.  These are the double tacos with a good heaping of amazing meats so to pack away five of these bad boys does not take maximum effort but common sense may prevent it (not really).Of the entrées I have had they were well worth it but always feel bad if I do not get a street taco from here. They have hands down the best carnes in town, I would encourage anyone coming here to vary from the usual suspects; I like the cheek (not that one) the beef cheek here is amazing as well as tongue (lengua). Some of the textures of items like the pork skin or tripe (tripia) may be off putting but the flavor is definitely an experience and one not to be missed.They have what I refer to as the usual suspects (Asada, Carnitas, Barbacoa and Al Pastor) down to a science for maximum flavor and never dried out, there inventory rotates so fast I doubt this would ever be a problem. They have a pretty good system as they are always grilling the shells for the tacos so its at a good temp for the meat.  A good add-on to your meal is the grilled leeks or peppers, they are more for flavor than anything else. If you see something interesting try it by all means try it as this place is oozing with authenticity and I am yet to have anything here I did not like. Just be careful with the sauce bar as if you are not familiar you may end up having to drench your tacos in another sauce in order to cover up a mistake (swear it was not me and really a friend). To complete your meal especially if you took a bunch of the extra spicy sauces the fried bananas with cream and cheese is amazing. The Gorditas are also worth a try as they are made in-house and are perfect for pastor and carnitas. I would also recommend things like the Parrillada Mexicana which is sausage, steak onions and peppers grilled to perfection; I think it was the only thing I ate that entire day as that portion was pretty filling. I also like walking around after with the grade horchata it lasts way past the meal. This place gets five stars for me because I have never had anything here that was not amazing, it is filled with authenticity and I get truly excited with just the thought of going here that I start salivating."}, {"review_id": "Mz2eExzjn59E1zTnPpdzEg", "user_id": "QZ8qKlrrDA0gyNE1XDkA0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Came here with friends on a taco crawl , so many things I wanted to try but i had the carne asada taco and it was perfect !

On the scale of authentic Mexican food in Kansas City, this place is most certainly at the top. The street tacos are $1.99 or $1.49 which is a steal of a deal for what you get. I came here the other day for lunch with a friend and he ordered 4 tacos and I ordered 5 tacos...my brain was hungrier than my stomach; 4 tacos from this place is plenty! The tacos come double wrapped in fresh small corn tortillas and you can fill them with your choice of deliciously cooked, marinated, braised, and roasted Mexican style meats.I had two carnitas tacos, two al pastor tacos, and one chorizo taco; and, all of them deserve 5 stars! My personal favorite of the tacos was the al pastor, small marinated pieces of pork heaven in some type of pineapple/red sauce...AMAZING! The carnitas were also quite tasty as was the chorizo. The goodness doesn't stop at the tacos though because the variety of salsas that they prepare at Bonito Michoacán are simply superb! The three that stand out in my mind are: the salsa verde, a green avocado salsa, and a creamy red hot salsa! OMG my mouth is watering even thinking about this (see pictures below)!My friend and I commented to each other that these were the best tacos that we had ever had! I think that is saying something seeing that I am from San Francisco and he is from New York! If it isn't tacos that you are in the mood for, Bonito Michoacán has plenty of other items to choose from, like burritos, traditional gorditas, lamb stew, menudo, etc.The line here may be long at lunch but it moves fast! Plus, with prices at 1.50-2.00 a taco if you like traditional Mexican fare then this place is NOT to be missed! I just wished I lived a little closer so that I could come here like every other day!;)"}, {"review_id": "Du5NQ8mMyO3p-Lr0hOGAeA", "user_id": "Rb8MjLq3qUG5SP99FNTVVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/20/2016", "text": "WOW!!!! is all I can say...for real though!

Beware, you may have to wait but it is worth it. Years ago I thought nothing could be better than Carne Asada, and then on a visit to Mexico I discovered Al Pastor and never looked back, well tonight was another life / culinary turning point for me - Discada!! How in the hell have I never had this before? Discada it a cornucopia of grilled meats combined - beef, pork, bacon, ham... It's Pastor on steroids. The restaurant is a clean well lit area inside of the grocery store with seating for about 30+.

I jumped into my car & headed to KCK.When I arrived at this grocery store/restaurant  I was expecting a long wait but to my surprise there was a short line & service was moving fast. The line is cafeteria style & you order what you would like at the beginning not as you move along. The tacos are $1.49 & $1.99 but on Tuesdays & Fridays take $.49 off. What I didn't know is that you can add lettuce, tomato, sour cream, etc. for an extra charge. (There is a small sign stating this) You have your chose of about 6-8 different types of meats for your tacos. There is everything from chicken to pork cheek available. I ordered 2 tacos, steak with onions & cilantro & pork, pineapple, onions with cilantro & onions on top. Both of my tacos were good. The seasoning on the meat was OK. The meat was tender but not that juicy. The amount of meat that I received for the price was good.  There is a 'sauce' cart after you pay that you can add to your food. There were 5 sauces in the cart & all were spicy (to me). There was a container in the cart that had pickled peppers in it & a container that had lime wedges in it.  If you want to try the sauces you have to ask the cashier for a container to put your sauce in. They were all worth trying...good flavor.There is a small seating area with metal tables & chairs. This area has about 6-7 table sets but is cleaned up as fast as people left. Therefore, there wasn't any waiting around for a table. I didn't get a look around the grocery store but I did see a steady stream of people coming & going through out the store.They also have a bakery across the street that I plan to try on another visit. Overall, the tacos were good & I would purchase again if I was in the area. I would try different meats & add different toppings.

The quality of the meat is fantastic; it is lean beef with no tendon/gristle. The meat itself has great flavor and is not too oily. The tacos are great value for the price you pay; there is a generous helping of meat, onions, and cilantro on top of two corn tortillas. There are also a variety of sauces you can add for extra spice or other flavor in a salsa bar set up next to the register after you pay. On my most recent visit I had two tacos for around $3.25 and left feeling quite satisfied.The structure of the restaurant is similar to a fast casual place with an assembly line type of ordering system. First, jump into the line and wait your turn then tell the helpful employees what you would like. You then receive your food at the cashier and pay. While the line can sometimes be a bit long, it moves quickly and you will have no trouble getting your food in a timely manner. Also, I have never had a problem with finding seating after ordering and the tables have been clean every time.As the restaurant is located inside a grocery store, you can pick up some drinks like Jarritos or Mexican Coke to wash your meal down with or shop for some cheap fresh produce on your way out."}, {"review_id": "7IgF2oJQ9zLYj1_zLGyoiQ", "user_id": "0oDdGsGqgCdllvFVPNuIKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2017", "text": "The only place I can find in the Midwest that I truly like.

Their taco menu could truly stand alone, but the rest of the menu had me making mental notes for next time while I waited in line (I see you, Chile Relleno..). I went with a few of my favorites, the Asada, a couple Pastor, and a barbacoa. Each one is perfection in a double lined corn tortilla. Simple. Authentic. Flavorful. Legendary.I love the addition of a heavy dosage of cilantro and onion on top, and while these tacos can stand alone, I had to feed my hot sauce/salsa addiction on at least one of them. I'd be totally lying if I could tell you what was in the green sauce I put on one of my tacos, but it tasted fantastic and had just enough kick. I dared to try the dangerous looking, hot orange sauce and it was not for me. Four of these tacos, at $1.49 is about the best value for quality food that I've found in a while. It's also more than enough as I was stuffed after eating it. We perused the market a bit and loved seeing all the baked Mexican goodies and things that you can't find at the local Hen House. While it's a bit of a trip for me to get here (~25 minute drive), it's definitely on my mind for a return trip. In the meantime, I'll just sit here and dream about them as lunchtime rolls around."}, {"review_id": "NM2RZA0lBDwfe8-YjEp7CA", "user_id": "mtWfJZKSmYIa2P3HiUI2zA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2017", "text": "This little grocery store has the best street tacos.

Next, I liked the set up, it seemed more streamlined than some of the other places we visited. Finally though, the tacos! I had carnitas and it was awesome. The salsa was a great accompaniment, very flavorful and packing a punch but not too hot.
