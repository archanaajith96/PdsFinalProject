We have been coming here for years. I love the dark cozy and romantic atmosphere and sort of steam punk vibe. The food is so good! My favorite thing is their sweet potato fries with some sort of Asian flavored topping on them. Their Ruben and Mac and cheese are really good and so are their burgers. They also have great lettuce wraps and nachos for appetizers. Service is always great and we actually came for breakfast once too and were pleasantly surprised at how tasty their breakfast options were as well."}, {"review_id": "h4NNvC4TuonF4_DOi4LADA", "user_id": "Cdbuc3bKT4t-bwC8gBgEcw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Basic bar food done to the quality you'd expect for bar food.

They wouldn't let us order appetizers until someone came and then, they wouldn't let us order appetizers until everyone arrived (06:15). It was so dark, we all had headaches. It was so loud, we could only yell at the people sitting beside us or text, so we had our phones out to talk to people at the table. They didn't bring out the appetizers until 06:45 and they were cold like they were setting out for a while. We ordered potstickers but they were cold and soggy, cheese wontons but they were cold and hard, nachos but they were cold and all glued together with no real toppings unless you could figure out how to cut off a slab, and warm pita and yummy hummus (That was actually the best hummus that I have ever tasted). The waiter was friendly and he was good at managing a large party. He kept our waters full. We were short menus and silverware though. It worked really well for my handicapped grandfather. The waiter went down one side of the table (instead of coming to each chair) to take our orders and as noisy as that place was, it seemed rude and lazy to me. The waiter waited until like 07:30 to get our orders and we didn't get our food until 08:15 and even then, he brought out everything for one side of the table and they were halfway through before he brought the food for the other side of the table. My food didn't come until 08:30. I had a soggy, cold grilled cheese and cold, stiff french fries from the children's menu for $6 because I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg. It was after 9 and my sister was sick with a migraine from the horrible lighting and the noise plus I work overnights, so I had been awake all day and all night and the waiter still hadn't brought the checks, so I left a 10 for my mother to pay for me and I took my sister to get medicine and I took her back to the hotel. My family didn't get back until after 10 and everyone was still hungry, so we got more food and it ended up being an expensive night. Nobody planned on being at a restaurant for 5 hours and if we were all still hungry and it was too loud to enjoy each other's company, what is the point?"}, {"review_id": "eBM3i37d-rPS9oEQ-pONQQ", "user_id": "rvmzmA1pBznVAeORraRTzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "I'd been here several times over the past several years and came back most recently in October 2017. I was super bummed that they got rid of their Zeppelin Bites. However, they still had my favorite sandwich with turkey and apples and we also had these parmesan fries that were tasty.

Thick chunks of bacon, cashew nuts, Granny Smith apples, Brussel sprouts and vinegarete was yum yum yum! And a huge portion. Parmesan fries were also delicious - and huge! The ranch dip was excellent too.For my entree I had the Mac and cheese.  Smoked gouda-jalapeno cheese sauce with macaroni noodles, house cured bacon, wild mushrooms & bread crumb topping - I minused the shrooms, added grilled chicken and couldn't eat even half of it the portion was so huge, but also rich and tasty.My bff had a burger and was totally beaten by it and the string onions too.  Like they say, you don't go here to save money or diet.  It was top class and I can't wait to go back to Iowa to go here again!! Server was quick and friendly, food was hot and plentiful, parking was easy and in abundance.  Neither of us used the restrooms to report back on those or the bar, but what we did use we liked!"}, {"review_id": "7SB3m-5Z6ULvmhygWbRNDA", "user_id": "nMh1Ijrry953nDXuognfEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "I go to zeppelins pretty often and it can be a lot of fun. Lively atmosphere, good drink specials. Some of the cocktails are delicious and interesting. I love the potstickers and often get them as a meal. Hummus is great too. The charley is a great meaty bad for you but so good sandwich, shaved prime rib, onion tangles, horseradish sauce and topped with an egg. The turkey burger is also strangely addictive. They change up the entrees which can be good and bad, if you have a favorite it can be sad. It is dark, and can get loud especially on weekends, but that's part of the experience. The servers are always nice and friendly. We love Nick! The ticket times are a bit longer then the normal bar fare but the quality of food is much higher so it definitely a good trade."}, {"review_id": "E7Jb6bwQSvINIY95YzEIBg", "user_id": "ZQ0XMVYsc_yojXcvz8baJQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Just had lunch at Zeppelins--food is passable bar food, a little better than Applebee's, but expectable.

When the server did finally come back we asked for a to go container. Nothing for 10 minutes.

It's very spacious and chic with moody lighting, leather booths, and metallic tables. We stopped in for lunch so it wasn't very busy. Our server was friendly and attentive. The food came quickly and in very generous portions. We split the single Nina's Nachos plate - it was awesome and still had half of it to take home! We also shared the Cuban sandwich, so good.

Friendly and attentive staff that had our refills covered and really had the timing of their service down as well.The smokehouse turkey burger had us impressed. So well executed you just have to taste it. The Charley was a good sandwich if you're a meat fan. I enjoyed a mango lemonade as well. I just expected a fake-tasting thing, but they at least had mango nectar in there if not fresh squeezed!The one draw-back or confusion for us is a place with this atmosphere (dark and beautiful) and caliber of food that has kids squealing and running about. I'm all for families, but this just doesn't seem like the place to let your kid romp around the room. I feel like seating could've had better execution. Regardless, you really need these tastes in your life.
