On our last day of a Portland Me weekend i thought we wouldn't make it here but so glad we did. It was damn right delicious. Possibly the best doughnuts I've had. My husband and I shared one fresh lemon. They have plenty of artisanal flavors to go around for every palette - fruit, to chocolate to chai to plain etc. The real wow factor is the texture achieved from using real sweet potato ( not just the flour) in the doughnuts. That gets you a crispy, exterior and dough-y yet dense interior. Hard to explain but worth trying. There was hardly a line at noon on Sunday. It was $2 and some change for one. Come early before they sell out and eat it fresh. It's amazing warm. Worth the hype. 5 stars! The only thing that comes close (but is different ) is my native dough doughnuts in nyc. These are much more manageable to take down so there's that."}, {"review_id": "bLVcEY4QLPt51ksLy5JDkQ", "user_id": "VqOThJQIUY6LHLr6DtROyQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "My husband is not a fan of doughnuts at ALL. He makes a point of avoiding them at all times, so when I wanted to visit the Holy Donut he was not pleased. When I forced him to try a bite after making some pretty loud happy noises, he was shocked and ultimately converted. He says, 'Doughnuts should not taste this good!' Also, the fact that they have CBD coffee is a plus. I mean, what a great combo that is."}, {"review_id": "_Z32ZIASK4dkKwXQ_Jw_Rg", "user_id": "ZAjyeI-DVMERNvPpP7DbkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Ever since I ate my first donut here several years ago, it's been one of the first places I go whenever I travel to Portland. I often mention them to friends because saying \"potato donuts\" is almost as much fun as eating them. They are so moist and delicious without being heavy or greasy.My favorites are the breakfast donut filled with bacon and cheese, which is such a perfect way to start the day, the dark chocolate sea salt and the old fashioned. Those are my standbys for delicious, unfussy donuts. I also just tried triple berry for the first time and enjoyed it. Their coffee is delicious too. Get there early for the breakfast donuts before they sell out. They also travel well; I've flown them to New York and traveled a few more hours to New Jersey on multiple occasions and these donuts have held up."}, {"review_id": "Rt2_S7ERdXPzIS4gjg7aJg", "user_id": "bVRwy8knBJkhBiSlffFzXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Iconic. I can safely say this place has one of the BEST donuts I've ever had. If you're a fan of more cakey/chewy donuts, than this is the place to-go! We asked the person behind the counter what their most popular donuts are, and he replied Fresh Lemon and Dark Chocolate Sea Salt. The Fresh Lemon donut was tart, and not too sweet. I couldn't even tell that this donut was vegan in comparison to the Dark Chocolate Sea Salt donut! The second donut wasn't as good as the Fresh Lemon, but it was still amazing nonetheless. The saltiness of the donut really brought out the chocolate flavor within the donut. I honestly wish I had bought more flavors to try them all out, but I was so stuffed from lunch that all I could manage was buying 2 to share with my sister. I'll be back if I'm ever in Portland again!"}, {"review_id": "8JTeT4hvga96nLeHXpks-A", "user_id": "cwRx3c1-oUrl65v4Vtx66w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Holy donut sells potato based donuts that are a cross between cake and yeasted donut textures. They sell some funky flavors with stuffed creams and jellies but have found that their more plain flavors work best with the dough so they aren't super heavy or sweet. Highly recommend their coffee cake donut (crumble coated donut), and their sweet potato glazed as it's unique and just sweet enough. They sell iced coffee (or cold brew?) with coffee ice cubes which is great if you love a strong brew, no ice watered down cold coffee here! Usually a line but it goes quick, ask for a box if you are planning on taking most to-go as they seem to give them in bags unless you ask."}, {"review_id": "OdmFmODrheMjWOD2agcOJg", "user_id": "YkZarGOu8P9r3ISxya_BIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Yum donuts!! They have a great selection of fun flavors, but they definitely don't over do it. We walked straight up to the counter and picked out 6 donuts and some coffee for our road trip. The donuts are a little more on the cakes/chewy side. I'm more of a fluffy donut kind of person, so that's the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. The flavors were all really good, though a little on the lighter side. If you're vegan, definitely try their vegan donuts--I couldn't even tell the difference!! Overall, great fresh donuts with delicious flavors and friendly service! Would come by again if in the area!"}, {"review_id": "08bn0MWQLL_JmtIc9nJrAg", "user_id": "4VryhlYwOdFOD-L5RT3v2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "The Holy Donut is my ceremonious first breakfast in Portland in every trip. It's fun, it's fresh, it's different, and most importantly: it tastes good. This location is sometimes tricky with parking. There is street parking, but like most cities, you might have to park farther out and walk. The streets are cobblestone and the sidewalks brick, sometimes uphill. Holy Donut is nestled at the bottom of a hill, which makes it a little more accessible. I'm not the biggest donut fan. I'm very particular and really lonely love cake donuts. But these are beyond good. Their donuts are made from actual mashed Maine potatoes (not potato flour). They're thick, dense, and don't have that lingering fried taste you sometimes get from donuts. They have a variety of flavors - some seasonal - and beware: they're known to sell out of one or two if you go later on in the day. I ordered a chai donut, my boyfriend got maple bacon and chocolate sea salt, and my friend ordered the maple. They also serve coffee from Coffee By Design (another Portland favorite). The service is exceptional, the staff is awesome and helpful. They're willing to make your visit enjoyable and well with the trip back."}, {"review_id": "L7eS4lqH6wOsfo6E6YQ4gw", "user_id": "qC50T_ldJ96wPBNDD6vtEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "You had me at potato donuts...well, actually I was kind of skeptical, but now I get it. My friend, a local, pointed the shop out to me while we were touring around Old Port raving about how great it was. So, I came back the next morning to try one. I tried the dark chocolate glazed donut and a chai latte. Both were delicious. Regular donuts are reasonably priced at $2.32 and specialty donuts are $2.78. I wanted to try a bunch of the donuts, but one is pretty filling, so maybe bring some friends with you so you split them up. There is limited seating inside, but on a Friday morning I was able to find a seat. Some of the seats face out towards Exchange Street, which is a nice place to sit and people watch. Tourists and locals alike frequent this shop, and staff is friendly and patient with both."}, {"review_id": "vA2CnWOWBYyGDlxX-289KQ", "user_id": "u7tbCCWV8g9IaOG3uORnyA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "We had to drop in and have doughnut.  I had the maple bacon and my wife had the berry berry!

Hands down one of the best donuts I have ever tried !! My fam and I were pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this cute donut shop, boasting of its donuts made using natural Maine mashed potatoes as its base. As someone who never tried potato donuts, much less knew that was a thing, I was intrigued and had to try.   We ordered half a dozen donuts of various flavors: sweet potato ginger glaze, dark chocolate sea salt, maple and cinnamon sugar. Every single flavor was delicious--super decadent,  moist,  and flavorful. I'd have to say my favorite goes to the sweet potato ginger glaze (who know that those flavors could go well together?? )The Holy Donut definitely lives up to its name--its unique mashed potato base and creative combinations truly make it 'holy' or set apart from many donut joints I've tried.

Potato is a vegetable, soooo....it counts. I had to walk away with at least 6 (half dozen) and that's exactly what I did! Flavors I got:-Maple (delicious!)-Triple Berry Glaze (my favorite)-Pomegranate (really good)-dark chocolate glazed (not for me, but for my friend)-Maine Apple (so yummy!)-Coffee (I didn't try it but smelled good)I also got the apple cider to go, it was delicious and since it was a rather warm Fall day, I opted for it cold.

So I walked through the red brick road and ended up there. I couldn't have been more grateful that I did.From my knowledge, there are a bunch of locations (but I could be mistaken). I ended up at the one on Exchange street...When I walked in, I was welcomed with the smell of freshly baked donuts, warm smiles, and joy. I ordered the Dark Chocolate Coconut Donut which was probably the best decision I made that day. The actual donut was crumbly and soft. This treat is also interesting since they are potato based donuts and are gluten free! Getting really earthy in there. The donut was absolutely delicious and the flavors were just so powerful. The glaze wasn't to creamy and the coconut sprinkles were roasted just perfectly. They were crunchy but the actual coconut flavor was still prominent. And better yet, the donut didn't make me feel to full. I know this can be a downfall when you're stuffing your face in sugary goodness. I think everyone should check this place out (especially if you are donut lover). These combination of flavors will leave your surprised but satisfied!
