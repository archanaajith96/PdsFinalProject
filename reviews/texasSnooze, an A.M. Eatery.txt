They deserve the hype. Finding a parking place and waiting for a table are of course a hassle, but it's totally worth it. Most recently I went on a Monday at 10am and there happened to be no wait, but this is quite rare for them!I really love the \"light as a feather\" portion of their menu as it highlights healthy breakfast and brunch items. And these healthy items are still so innovative and delicious! My favorite dish is the Spring Has Sprung egg white frittata. It's so good that you don't even need to add avocado! I also love that Snooze is setting an example in Houston as an environmentally engaged restaurant. Really impressed that they compost, use low energy appliances, and don't pass out plastic containers. Hope other restaurants in town will follow their lead!"}, {"review_id": "4xh-ocwFnkAbzBv_OkuiFg", "user_id": "u5xRYdVlNHx0AsUt8JFBtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Dine here with my father, and the manager brought my a newly added pancake.  If it's not newly added, it was brand new to me.  LOL.That made my entire day.  She told me I was Beautiful, and wanted to buy me a pancake that has NEVER happened to me before ever.  I will always remember her.  Loved her energy just as much as she loved mines.Plus this was my fathers very first time trying the companies food.I order the shrimp and grits; I wasn't aware that it had sausage in it; I never been a fan of breakfast sausage.  They fix it, and got me crispy bacon instead; which I love!"}, {"review_id": "Wy84vSM0Ais31VvWsov1yg", "user_id": "ueEOfndljHk0PzKshIngAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Yes!

Got the Benny Duo and it was incredible! Snooze is probably still number 1 in my book for best brunch food in Houston. However, service quality was a bit off today. When we came in the restaurant, we stood at the front for maybe 5-10 minutes just waiting before there was actually a server to put my friend and I on the waiting list. There was no worker to organize the line, so many of us were clustered at the front not knowing what to do. Not a deal breaker, but just something to point out. Food quality is still most important and glad Snooze gets it right!"}, {"review_id": "4YwDdL3FPhi1TkHO_0WI8Q", "user_id": "sXBDTVU3pV31yKSWKhNcDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Cool breakfast/brunch location.

I honestly thought it would be longer, but thank goodness it wasn't because I was starving. The pancake flight was a great choice. Blueberry Danish Pancakes- MUST TRY! OMG! French Toast- Great Flavor Sweet Potato Pancakes- Delicious I added an order of bacon and scrambled eggs to my order. Their eggs were delish... bacon had a weird after taste to me, but my boyfriend loved it. Fast Service.. Tasty Food!

I don't even know where to begin. SMH. First, we both had a breakfast cocktail. I had a peach mimosa but I can't recall what he had. What I do know is that they were both great. We got the OMG French Toast, an omelette with chicken sausage, spinach and cheese and our waiter brought out something additional for us which was the cinnamon roll pancake.

This place gets busy quick and parking maybe limited because of it. Heard about this place from a lot of people so I figured I gave it a try.Drinks:Got house blend coffee, really wanted with ice and waiter even acknowledged it but got hot instead... no biggie. Coffee was just ok. Wife got hazelnut latte with almond milk. She said it was good.Food:Breakfast pot pie, not bad. The gravy is light and good. Pastry came fluffy too. Not much to talk about hash brown or egg. I did order sausage a la carte  and it was delicious and flavorful.Wife got ham Benedict III, she said it was great and it was. Hollandaise was soo light and flavorful. Muffin and ham goes well together.I feel if you come here try this type of dish something you can't make at home. Sweets: omg french toast. Pretty good. Can't explain much. Toast was a little soggy with all the vanilla creams and mascarpone. But it's pretty goodWhat I'm about to say next matters lol duddddde serano pepper sauce at the table was BOMB!! So good and the Ingredients in it is good I don't see chemical names. I want to buy me a bottle too. Good experience... $50 later, having thoughts of if I will come back.

There is street parking but I'm glad I got into the lot. Walked in and was seated immediately. My server came right over and she was good- I could tell by her promptness, smell and swagger.; however, she still had to replace my silverware because my spoon was definitely not clean. The resturant is very clean and lively. The colors and lighting used gives the place life at all times. I ordered the Cortoda coffee espresso and it came in a shot glass -too hot for me to handle (I have delicate hands)My server got me a coffee mug and poured it into it. I was surprised that the it didn't reach halfway. It was strong-good and strong. I needed it for this morning. I also ordered a small pineapple juice which was very good and sweet- I should have ordered a large one.Today I ordered  Ahhh La Carte! Bacon -Hmmm Bacon, 2 Eggs scrambled, extra crispy hash browns and fruit. The fruit was sweet and juicy, the bacon not only had a maple like smell but taste as well. The hash browns were cooked just right with a light tasting flavor.

We got the harvest Benedict and the OMG French toast. Both were really delicious. The harvest Benedict had really perfectly cooked eggs with delicious runny yolk, also a hint of lemon or lime which went really well the quinoa and bits of veggies. Such good flavor, and a bit mushy (which I liked). The recommended OMG toast had a delicious caramel, creamy, coconut flake sauce with fresh strawberries. Mmmmmmm! Great recommendation! We went Friday morning, waited about 15-30min, still more than I expect for a weekday. They said they would text me when they had an opening, but didn't text...Found they called us 15 min ago...So be careful and stick around!

The menu, extensive. The food: delectable, with a variety of sweet and savory options. If you're starving for a belly bursting breakfast, definitely try it out!A few worthwhile mentions:- OMG French toast (5/5): OMG says it. The perfect combo of soft, and sweet. If you dont try anything else, GET THIS. - sweet potato pancakes (4/5): fluffy, the size of your face (and probably bigger). syrup -spuds deluxe (4/5): savory blend of potatos, bacon, egg, avocado. - a la carte fruit and toast (4/5): simple, yet fresh.Service is fast and friendly. However, I had to subtract one star for the wait and parking. I'd definitely recommend coming here early or be prepared for a long wait. We came as a large party of 8 on an early Friday morning right around opening time, and only waited 20 minutes for a table. However by the time we were leaving, the restaurant was already packed. Parking is abysmal. The Snooze is tiny, so you're left to street park at your own discretion."}, {"review_id": "bq23oTDoj3y-T62JvC8hxg", "user_id": "32ZLvaBT40ilGwlFiMIf1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Fresh atmosphere!

I've heard tales of long waits, but on a December Tuesday before 10 am we had no such problem. They have a 50s diner theme, but it's pretty corporate looking and I wasn't digging the color scheme.The menu is big enough to please picky eaters, with plenty of variations on breakfast sandwiches, egg benedicts, and pancakes, as well as a section for healthy options that went beyond the usual sad egg white omelette. There's also lots of drinks, both alcoholic and non.As this was after holiday feasting, I opted for the quinoa breakfast bowl. My parents did a corn beef hash and the Snooze Continental. Food took maybe 20 minutes to come out.I was pleasantly surprised by the quinoa, which soaked up the flavor of the broth quite well. The carrots and egg were also cooked perfectly (tender and over easy with a nice soft yolk, respectively). The prosciutto just didn't work-- way too salty. My parents were both happy with their dishes.Service was on top of it when there, but seemed spread thin across a large restaurant that wasn't that busy. It does seem like they try very hard here. Prices are not posted online but I remember them being reasonable. Street parking was not too difficult.Not sure I would wait in line for this but there's much to like here."}, {"review_id": "pj2cE9cI87aKnTdBtQ2WBA", "user_id": "2x4SFLumawQPPzYcx6v_7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "The first time I tried this food chain I was visiting California, not realizing we had one here in Houston. I absolutely loved the one in Cali and thought this would be a great way to start my hubby's birthday off. We waited approximately five minutes before being seated. Kudos to the hostess as he sent over a chocolate covered pancake with a lit candle in celebration of my husband's birthday. We hadn't received a menu or water. This was really thoughtful of him and we really appreciated the gesture. He loved the pancake and tried really hard not to eat it all. LOLWe started with the pomegranate margarita. This is an AWESOME cocktail. It consisted of Espolon Blanco Tequila, orange liqueur, pomegranate shrub, house sour and fresh lime. Just the right of amount of alcohol to get a nice buzz. Only drink 2..... I also tried their hot chocolate. However, it is served in a tall glass with lots of whip cream. Be prepared to have whip cream around your mouth and a little on your nose. My hubby ordered the Benny Duo, so you'll have to check his page for the review on his breakfast. Just a little note, he didn't leave much on his plate. I ordered the shrimp and grits. The homestyle cheesy grits were loaded with sautéed shrimp, andouille sausage, peppers, leeks and topped with a sunny side up egg. The dish was good. However, I wasn't feeling that egg sitting on top of my entrée. I politely removed it. Thanks to Tristan and the staff at Snooze for making this a great birthday start for the hubby. I'm sure we'll see you soon!"}, {"review_id": "X3xj5Gx-OC6gZ3sAJueBOQ", "user_id": "rdZESSPeqypxSk1tQuttIQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "The line was extremely long so my husband and I decided to put our name on the list and then just go get groceries and come back.

I decided to change it up and come on a saturday at 10am. (Major success!)  The wait tune was one hour. While you wait there is a area near the hostess area that provides free coffee while you wait. My wait turned out to be around 45 mins.  You can come with a group but I wouldn't recommend over six.  They dont seem to have larger tables available. The menu has lots of healthy options.  My server was very friendly the food was so damn good!  I ordered the Sam I Am sandwich and substituted the sausage for bacon and opted for lightly scrambled eggs with light cheddar cheese.  The hashbrowns were the perfect size and seasoned well. I didnt even need ketchup but may I suggest adding the Basil hot sauce.  I gave the hashbrowns a very unique flavor. My friend ordered the Sweet Potatoe Pancakes with Chicken sausage.   I liked her food better than mine. The chicken sauce is flavored and a lil spicy. I plan to only order that as a healthier option.  In additiom we each ordered drinks O think she had the Pomegranate Mimosa and I ordered the Grapefruit mimosa.  It was great and well worth $8. Overall great place to eat if you have time to wait and I assume they have Wi Fi as I saw a few people with laptops at tge bar. The only downfall would be the lack of parking available, wait times, and tge fact that they close at 2:30pm each day. I think they should have at least one day the are open later.  This is a must try!!!!!!!!"}, {"review_id": "Wcz5Lu-hHrO-FhQukqLqSQ", "user_id": "OpbnUx-6AHqY8ai6JhYv7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Wait is a pain in the *ss.  I was here over a year ago and waited 2 hours so it took me a while to come back.  This time it was a 45-1 hour, which was what they quoted me on the two hour wait but actually this time it was fulfilled.  Parking is pretty much street curb unless you get lucky to park on their half of the parking lot.Carful of the potential crazy bums walking along Montrose.My picks are the pancakes and the Benedicts.  The pancake of the day wasn't as good as the pineapple Pancake but it's not bad just not as impressive.  Definitely ask for the syrup to go w the pancakes.  They might give you a tiny one but I like to drown mine so definitely ask for two if you are a syrup lover.The breakfast burrito was meh.Hubby likes the hash.Careful where you park on the street cause I got a ticket!"}, {"review_id": "NH-chcobIzbM5CsCuymJpg", "user_id": "G9Wt2635cSrZ_CUPIU5TtA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Their Montrose location is just around the corner from where I live, but I only venture here in weekdays where the wait is manageable.
