It was a lentil soup with small bites of potatoes. I was tempted to tip the bowl up and drink the last drop (like we did when our parents weren't looking when we were kids. Next I enjoyed a beet salad with goat cheese and avocado and arugula. It was sooooo good I wish I could back up and eat it all over again. I know that the owner (Aric) and a biz partner (Matt) are going to open the Farm at Los Olivos. It's a spectacular plan that the community overwhelmingly supports. That will be an organic farm with an education center and concessions where the harvested foods will be served. You can read about that here: phoenixrealestateandhome….So back to the parlor: it's good. Fresh, and wonderfully made food. I'll be back, again and again."}, {"review_id": "7tPOGsCULHEwMZeQId6-Cg", "user_id": "1bW3RKZFqFmXlpbbGeOs7w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Ok Parlor, I must say I really like you.My pasta was perfect, my margarita wasn't too sweet and just the right amount of everything.

Took a chance on this place for a late night meal, so happy I did. Plenty of on-site parking, including valet. Little tough to spot, eyes wide open! Seemed like a good bar area adjacent, but I was hungry, and grabbed a seat at the pizza counter and had an outstanding dinner. Tremendous service by Eddie, who helped me select an incredible Pizza that included sausage and basil..made it right in front of me, fun to see the pizza makers use the kiln. Fabulous meal. Fair pricing.

Ate alone and sat at the pizza bar, which was an excellent experience. I had checked other reviews and tried the cauliflower, which needed some more salt and felt the sauce was a bit runny. Overall a decent dish but wouldn't come just for this. I had also ordered the sausage pizza, which was great. I didn't notice the daily specials board, otherwise I would have ordered some dishes off of there. Loved the crust on the pizza but felt there were too many toppings on the actual pie and weighed it down a bit. By the time you get half way done, the pizza is soggy."}, {"review_id": "e3W030YtbfwKpwGkw2QMtA", "user_id": "8xTbX-d72wD5lAL1YHuPTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Loved the pizza, service, and atmosphere.

Came here with coworkers on a weeknight so we were able to catch happy hour that goes until 6 pm on weekdays. From the outside, this place looks super tiny so I was a bit worried since they unfortunately don't take reservations, but it's actually much roomier inside once than it appears.From the happy hour menu, we got $2 off white and red sangrias which brings down the price to $6 each. I enjoyed my red sangria very much. We also got the famous cauliflower gratinata (MUST TRY), and their 8 inch pizzas \"the house\" and \"vine ripe margherita.\" The pizzas were good, though not my favorite, but for the happy hour price, I was happy with it. Next time, I will definitely opt for one of the pastas or the burgers. For dessert, we got the tiramisu. This was soooooo good. If you check in for the first time on Yelp, you get 50% off one dessert so make sure you take advantage of this special!Parking in the back was small but there's maybe 30+ spots. The customer service was excellent and I truly enjoyed my night here. Will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "AaTLM3d6o9ksmhJKiXSk-g", "user_id": "SsGMcVYZQlX3a6PazZzjVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This place has the most amazing...Let's talk about lunch here and I'll get back to it's amazing-ness. I had the opportunity to go on a quick lunch date with my hubs. We absolutely love this place and decided to come have brunch/lunch here. The ambiance is fresh and quaint without being overly formal at all. There is inside and outside seating and in the nice weather it is very open and fresh inside. The wait staff is very attentive and not at all intrusive. So you can enjoy your meal without interruption or the thought that your server has gone on hiatus. We started with thier veggie noshboard and it was delicious. There were an assortment of roasted veggies that vary (ask your server for details). We had purple cauliflower, regular and purple fingerlings that were crispy outside and soft inside, breaded eggplant, roasted rainbow carrots, radishes, broccolini a side of thier house made marinara and house made ranch (best ranch ever, fresh herbs so creamy and light). It was beautiful and delectable. Next we got the funghi pizza and a brunch steak sandwich. The quality of the bread here is top notch. On the pizza it's chewy on the inside and has a nice crust on the outside...it's the best pizza in the city...hands down. I've waited for places with much longer waits & it wasn't as on point (the other place on my mind has better sauce tho...but that's for another review ). The sandwich had New York strip cooked order an egg, greens and sofrito. Amazing and I couldn't eat the whole thing. So back to the most amazing.... This whole dang place is amazing. The Parlor is amazing. They have great staff, amazing food and wonderful atmosphere.  I feel comfortable here with my toddler or on a date. Def check them out...maybe even for thier Happy Hour (sans kiddos of course).Ciao!"}, {"review_id": "KF7SAh3MH7rp5l0kRIa9jQ", "user_id": "eIsGqezWEmzvAI3kYD8F6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Thought we might have to be put on a waiting list at 9 pm Saturday night, but thankfully they had an open table.

She was helpful in offering a sample of two wines we were interested in, which helped us make a decision.We ordered the funghi pizza which was very delicious! The roasted mushrooms were so tasty, the crust was just the right thickness and the goat cheese gave it a delectable taste.We weren't rushed and was able to have a very pleasant dinner.Parking is a bit tricky at night, you have to pay attention to where the driveway is but once behind the restaurant there seems to be plenty of parking.I'd love to return to try other items on the menu!"}, {"review_id": "YoJd0UcWj_aWRdJOwCXV8Q", "user_id": "Ebmu-kn14n1wHgr-AN87QQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Another awesome meal at the parlor!

First, my party of seven arrived at 6:40pm on a Tuesday night and I get that it was unusually busy for a Tuesday and we had a large group so when they told us it would be a 20-30 minute wait... no problem but after an HOUR of waiting and we still hadn't been seated nor had anyone come to check on us I decided to wait just another ten minutes before leaving but the hostess finally came and told us our table was ready.  Then, our server was painstakingly S L O W.... He brought us all waters to start and then didn't come back for another 10 minutes to take our drink orders so we decided to order our food and drinks at the same time in case he decided to disappear again for another 10-15 minutes. For these reasons alone, I would give the Parlor 2-3 Stars. With so many great dining options in Greater Phoenix, you really cannot afford to be short-staffed or have bad customer service. What saved this rating was the food: easily 5 stars. All of their pasta and pizza doughs are made in-house from scratch and it shows. I had the Pappadelle Bolognese but I've tried pretty much everything on their menu and it is all wonderful. I will probably be back but definitely not during peak times."}, {"review_id": "8XS2aRU-JcbqiXEuFm4liA", "user_id": "P6ToRHoU8wbXBd-WJIAylw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Cozy, trendy, laid-back pizza.

The pictures attached, are at home, on the plate. When we called to order, they answered by the second ring, which is something I appreciate. They were friendly, and informative. It was an easy process. Parking was open and good, even though when we went inside to pick up our order, the restaurant was pretty full (on a Sunday night around 7:45) with young, trendy people. This wasn't surprising as it matched the decor, young and trendy. I really liked the vibe and atmosphere inside the restaurant, and we can't wait to go back to experience the very nice patio outside. The price was a little high, but not crazy. We ordered the spicy seafood linguine, the large one which is enough for two people, and a beet and goat cheese salad. The pasta was decent, not the best I have ever had. They give you a nice amount of shellfish, which is good, but the sauce lacked the \"wow\" factor. I would have done something different with that recipe. We enjoyed eating it though. The salad was though, phenomenal. It had an arugula base, beets, sweet potatoes, and a piece of crispy goat cheese. The dressing paired well and the salad is something I would try again. Again, we did takeout, but this place did a lot of things right. We can't wait to go back again and try one of the pizzas where the topping choices look superb."}, {"review_id": "I_usTB0Wp8B0Jq_YeTlhZA", "user_id": "HTyZDwjW-jUU6QJ8lhh0fQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Monday/Tuesday special is such an awesome deal- 12 inch pizza plus a pitcher of beer for only $25!

It's easy to miss driving by and I wouldn't have paid much attention to it except for the fact that my neighbors raved to me about it. When it came out in Phoenix's magazine as one of the top 10 pizza places in Phoenix I knew I finally had to try it.Happy hour is everyday from 3-6 so I decided to come at 3 on a Saturday for a late, late lunch. There was plenty of seating and parking available but I can tell how this place would fill up quickly at night - especially the parking.Good waiter, good service. I went with a classic pepperoni pizza and a draft beer, both of which were part of the happy hour menu. All of their pizzas are $7.50 during happy hour! The pizza was delicious. Thin crust that has flavor but not so thin that you feel like you're eating a cracker. It was baked perfectly. I enjoyed eating the crusts as much as I enjoyed the pizza. The pepperoni and mozzarella were plentiful and delicious.This place has good ambiance and would be great for a night out with friends or date night. I ended up getting a scoop of chocolate gelato as the Yelp check-in deal gets you 50% off a dessert. It was incredibly rich dark chocolate gelato. A great finish to a good meal.I'm excited to come back and try some of their pasta very soon!"}, {"review_id": "j2np9NPhGW8E1dl8mtECIw", "user_id": "Z_PFVN3z3RpEAMwe94cqVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "This is not just your local pizzeria where you grab a slice.
