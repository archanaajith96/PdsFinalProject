My daughter and I went for lunch today. This has been on my list of places to try for a while. The menu prices initially shocked me but the lunch specials were ok so we ordered. I had the Arepa and empanada combo with rice and beans for $11. My daughter had the empanada combo with 2 empanadas, rice and beans for $9. Both had fried plantains. Most of their entrees were over $14. Honestly. The food was cold. Reheated, not freshly fried. The empanada was good but when you know something is not fresh you just think how great it could be if it were. Same with the Arepa it was obviously warmed on the grill. The filling was good, but nothing amazing. Sides were also room temperature and the fried plantains tasted like they'd been fried in old grease. Needless to say, we did not order to bring home to my husband and will likely not be back. So bummed because I had such high expectations from the reviews."}, {"review_id": "2oDDzBfxFJTognuPe8WpfQ", "user_id": "40B3CGurhA7-JkMKlwzBQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "First time at the restaurant and the service was wonderful. Our server explained the food, made recommendations and was very attentive. Food was delicious! I had their empanada arepa lunch combo. The pork arepa was so tender and flavorful, and the empanada was buttery. A tasty sweet sauce came with the meal. Plantanes were a delight to finish off my meal, and they weren't mushy. I can't wait to return to this restaurant!!"}, {"review_id": "gtj_t38HDi0Heie8b_bhSA", "user_id": "EnQw88RthDMiKhnMhX51yQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/15/2016", "text": "'keep calm and arepa on' read the staff shirts, so I did. My lunch combo included Arepa, empanada, rice, black beans, some kind of ridiculously good garlic sauce and shredded carrot spiced with thyme. On both I got the beef, glad I  did the chicken I tried was dry. The beef inside the Arepa was ground and full flavor. The beef in the arepa was shredded and stuffed with plantain, black beans and crumbled white queso. The space is averaged size with wood tables and chairs. Great big windows give it lots of light. Their was a bar in the back with stools. Lots of great huge canvases with tons of color and texture were on the walls. Perfect lunch with a friend spot.Staff were awesome, and gave great recommendations. Part of an outlet with other shops, with tons of parking."}, {"review_id": "P1mVwGD0sP7YncKXZ18JGA", "user_id": "dg4cCwofYP97hu4Bs7ZFLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Had my daughter birthday here.  Service is very good, very attentive.  Food is a delish.  Would come back again."}, {"review_id": "8BppVn5flsGZn-fg_YFCMQ", "user_id": "HTn7X7ePG_9Uyg1TYs5sdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Wow!  What a great little place to have some amazing latin and Caribbean food.

I dunno, but while their business has picked up a LOT since I first started going to El Porton, sadly their service and food quality have dropped off. Last night, the hubby and I visited for the first time since mid-summer last year. We hadn't been in a while because the last time we were there, the service was terrible. I recall that I asked twice for silverware for our table and it never arrived, so I finally got up and went to chase down silverware. Not ok. Also, drinks were not refilled and food was really slow to arrive.Fast forward to this weekend when we decided to check them out again since this was once one of our favorite restaurants. First, one of the servers put someone else's food in front of us and then got upset when we told her it wasn't ours:\"This isn't what we ordered.\"\"Are you sure?\" \"Yes, this is not what we ordered.\" \"Are you really sure?!?\" \"Yes!\" I'm doing mostly vegetarian, so I ordered the house salad and the De Guasacaca arepa. I was REALLY looking forward to the arepa as I had ordered it on at least a couple of occasions in the past and really enjoyed it. De Guasacaca is supposed to be mostly avocado, but instead of avocado, I got an arepa filled with under-ripe flavorless tomatoes. I hate to be that person who complains that the food was bad and the serving was tiny, but really, the arepas are too small to charge $6 each unless they're stunningly good, but my arepa was literally so bad that I only ate two bites. When I told our server how bad it was she just grabbed my plate and walked off.  My husband ordered some sort of platter that had sausage, fried pork and skirt steak. He was unable to eat much of the pork because it was too chewy, but he loved the sausage. Otherwise, he was not impressed with his dish.We walked out of there with a relatively hefty bill considering we did not order alcohol and we definitely felt less than satisfied. Sadly, after two not-so-stellar experiences, we will be scratching El Porton off our list of favorite places."}, {"review_id": "Unka7qYJAnce8Pg7azETaQ", "user_id": "uONt5RWZISrgrkrj-4dbuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/27/2017", "text": "Near my hotel and reviews intrigued me.  I was not disappointed.  I definitely recommend."}, {"review_id": "D3blWjf-DEPcXP-LtyGGWQ", "user_id": "b45u1UV-TH2LRuC-Zr-hYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "I ordered enough food for a small army with the intent to bring half home.

I didn't review this??I had been dying to try this place. My sister in law is from Panama, and surprisingly a lot of the dishes offered remind me a lot of what she makes for dinners. This place did not disappoint. The appetizer dish, wish was a sampler of quite a few things was tasty, hot and fresh. The fried plaintain (or patacones as I know them) were AMAZING. It makes french fries look like chopped liver. So crispy and delicious.I got a pork hash-sort of dish, that came with rice and sweet plantains. All of which were just delicious and perfectly cooked. There was yucca mixed in the dish. I really wish there had been more of it, because yucca is just amazing, especially theirs - so flavorful. The only thing I really didn't enjoy in this meal, was the black beans that came with it. They weren't bad, but they were... pretty sweet. Way sweeter than I would have liked. I just don't think of black beans being sweet at all. I didn't eat much of them because the flavor just didn't seem to go with the rest of the meal, but I definitely look forward to coming back.Their flan by the way? Get it. Just do it. Eat it. Its perfection on a plate. I would have licked the plate.. had I not been in public and all.. just saying."}, {"review_id": "MWuN6A1MCQOtEIhokDxPLA", "user_id": "kvB46SHfAOyY8Kp6jc18Lg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/23/2016", "text": "Went here a week ago and had probably the best espresso I've ever had.Don't leave without ordering an espresso here.

It's tucked away in a shopping center off of Roe & Indian Creek Parkway. There wasn't much of a lunch crowd at all! Which was a plus and made it a comfortable, relaxed environment. We felt like our food took a while to come out but, we were all really hungry and you know how that goes lol. I will definitely return to try another Arepa.

I had this place bookmarked for a while, so I decided it was a good opportunity to try it.This place is an unassuming little Cafe in a strip of restaurants. The sign is plain, and it is a bit hard to find. I walked in, and the inside had a decent amount of seating, but was not large. I was greeted right away and seated towards the back.I looked at the menu and was intrigued by the Arepas, which I had never had before. They were only around $6 and sounded interesting. The description reminded me of a sandwich and the ingredients sounded good in the Arepa De Pabellon (beans, beef, and cheese), so I ordered it.My lunch came out quickly, probably about 10 minutes. The Arepa was not huge, but not tiny either. I tried eating it like a sandwich, but found the vessel to be a bit greasy, so I instead cut it into pieces and ate with my fork and knife. The beef was tender and had a really good flavor, not like anything I had ever tasted before. The spices (whatever they were) were perfect and made the sandwich very flavorful. The beans and cheese complimented the sandwich as well.My server was very warm throughout my meal and quickly refilled my water as needed. He made me feel welcome without being overbearing. I think this is the first time I have ever eaten Venezuelan and I was very pleased! I will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "sqC9d4V3_AstJsJpjySWLg", "user_id": "1VL37A_wk_t67j-WdDecpA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/5/2016", "text": "Very warm and open feeling as soon as we walked in.

I ordered the The Works lunch special because I couldn't decide exactly what I wanted and this allowed me to try several things. I really enjoyed it but I would have to say that it was too much food for just me. The ceviche was amazing - very fresh and wonderful flavors! I would definitely order it again. I also had the beef empanada and the chicken salad arepa. Hubby had a chicken empanada and an arepa (can't remember which one). He thought it was really good.

We wanted to make sure we made the most of our time so we perused Yelp and were intrigued by the high rating for this restaurant. We called first as lately we seem to arrive at places that are closed, permanently or just for the night. Luckily, this unassuming spot was open so we bopped over.When we arrived, there were quite a few families all enjoying their dinner in the relaxed atmosphere. Everything on the menu looked interesting but we aren't very familiar with Venezuelan cuisine. Our adorable waitress was trying to explain when she accidentally said a few words in Spanish. I followed up with Spanish and she was delighted. I am always a bit hesitant to speak Spanish as I don't want anyone to take it as a negative assumption on my part. We decided to split the bit of everything platter plus a few arepas she recommended. It was all heavenly although next time, I could definitely fill up on the heavenly arepas. We finished the meal with flan, coffee and the waitress and I becoming bff's. We were practically alone in the restaurant by the time we finished. Great meal, reasonable prices, free easy parking in an authentic ethnic restaurant.Plus I got to practice my Spanish.
