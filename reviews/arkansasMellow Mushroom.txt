Funky tie dye/ hippie interior. Actually, probably more hipster than hippie. If you can forgive the hipster then you are in for a treat. Several choices to customize. The brownie for dessert was great as well. Oh yeah, they also have a full bar. It's not to far from the interstate.I revised my Star rating. Originally I had 4 but after the very quick and nice response I became very impressed. It takes a lot of effort to comment on new reviews especially since there are so many sites with reviews. If they are that observant and dedicated that speaks volumes for their restaurant."}, {"review_id": "cQn3OZqklchwDIz0tIinHA", "user_id": "byiu5KFz0S5lEG_97_4WKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "This place is super trendy and good food.  Everyone liked their pizza and the chicken hoagie was delicious.  They are very vegan accomidating too."}, {"review_id": "PaJ0E5zbT4fK3OgCmujV-A", "user_id": "WZZZsGdz7ZcJPjPySdDPlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "This is now one of my favorite pizza places.

For starters, walking into the restaurant I felt like I was automatically transported from the South to a funkadelic 70s vibe space. Pretty Freaking Cool. Not only was the atmosphere laid back, the customer service was great! Our waitress gave my husband and I the scoop on the most popular dishes and was very patient as we took our time to decide.    Since we couldn't decide on just one flavor we decided to get two different kinds on ONE pizza. That's right-You can do half & half. The pizza was great as were our cocktails. If you like crust then you will love this place as the pizza has a lot of it. I'm not much of a crust fan so it was just ok to me. The only thing I didn't like was their non-alcoholic lemon or lime drink. That drink was pretty gross but everything else was good so check them out!"}, {"review_id": "hZaRu3z7IPIAfAIIQYxKaA", "user_id": "sUH-jylOByKo5AgoIA0YiQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I love the Mello!  The atmosphere is relaxed...they could turn the heat up a bit though.  Great bear selection and a full bar as well.  Bruschetta is a great app, fresh tasting and crispy bread.  Many pizza choices, and you can always customize for your taste.  A regular place for me and the family!!4/9/2017. Update!!  I still like coming here.....however....the last couple of visits have been a bit subpar in the service arena.  I still love a special Mediterranean we order, if your interested message me.  Felt a bit rushed by the servers the last couple of visits...esp today.  I mean...come on...ordering a drink as the waiter walks off is a bit frustrating!.....especially when he continues to walk off as you increase your voice volume to compensate the distance!!!!  Nice patio...love outdoor eating....so they still have us....but Mellow...if your reading....step it up!.........I did get a free shot of tequila though...shame on me?.....I did not tell....nah"}, {"review_id": "-7P0XNm6XH93LDj6EyRpBA", "user_id": "zoCon3RA15xCFFIKTlAi9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/27/2017", "text": "Awesome spot!

Visited one in Florida a few years back. In town visiting our daughter who goes to college at UofA. Matt was our server and he was very friendly, sweet and attentive. We didn't order one of their speciality pizzas, we built our own. It was very good. Loved the crust and sauce. I also ordered a small house salad which was very large for being a small. Tasted great. When we are back in town and want pizza, we will come back to Mellow Mushroom."}, {"review_id": "JyS-XSca888rsx3NPG_3ww", "user_id": "9OE5LoUwJQ-Sis8Fbp3rvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/30/2017", "text": "Staff was very cool.

The servers & bartenders are highly knowledgeable about the offerings, both food & brews. Your order will always be done right here! As a Type 1 Diabetic, I need to have really thin crust, & they always are cheerful about accommodating this need of mine. We love the Magical Mystery Tour pizza; it's a pesto base, w/ Portobello mushrooms, veggies & we always add the Italian Sausage. Truly delectable meal! The salads are also excellent. Finally, you just cannot find a larger selection of local, regional & national craft beers!
