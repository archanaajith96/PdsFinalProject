Ramen is not my go-to, but I would most definitely come back to this cute ramen shop. The soup is rich, smooth, and filling. The ramen is not too soft and not too chewy. The chasu is tender and tasty. I got a regular sized bowl and I couldn't even finish. And to pair off the great ramen, waiting time is at most 15 minutes.

Noodles are cooked perfectly al-dente, broth is flavorful, and the toppings are fresh, juicy, and seasoned well.One downside I see in the food is that the broth seems a little on the salty side. I'm not sure if the stock is all made in-house, but my taste buds sense a \"little\" MSG.. Portion sizes are nothing to write home about, and are actually pretty underwhelming for that fat price tag. As a skinny Asian guy, I didn't even get full from the upgraded combo (which came out to a whopping $16 lmao). Basically, when you're paying over $15 for a single-person meal that doesn't fill you up and doesn't contain the highest quality ingredients...whelp, you do the math!"}, {"review_id": "w-Eh96MhhgOytilcTO_oNA", "user_id": "vlSgfeSOYQekCPgAv4wfCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I have to say this is probably one of the best ramen places I have tried.

Anyways, this ramen place does seem overhyped to me. The egg wasn't yolky - way too cooked and wasn't infused with anything like other ramen places. If you're not getting the combo, don't get the egg separately. Anyways I ordered #103 which was the medium spicy miso ramen, salmon roe bowl, with a side of egg. The portion here seems small but it's decent. I think the bowl is kind of misleading. On to the ramen, it wasn't that flavorful to me. Not really sure what people meant. Overall just thought it was ok. The salmon roe was good. I love getting this because the salmon and rice is dry and then the salmon roe just bursts in your mouth!! Once again, egg was not good. I didn't read the reviews before coming but this was inside a food court. Parking was hard to find but we were lucky. There was a line but didn't feel so long to get through it, probably took around 45 mins?

Usually I never expect ramen in a food court to be any better than average, but Hokkaido Ramen Santouka was a nice exception. I was told to go early because it gets really crowded and they only take cash. The menu was pretty standard with Shio (Salt), Shoyu (Soy Sauce), Miso Ramen (Soybean paste) with different variations like a Charsiu Ramen or a Spicy Miso. Although its not on their online menu, they also had some combination options like pairing ramen with a salmon-ikura bowl, etc. It is very helpful that they have a large glass display of menu items and prices. I decided to get the Large Miso Ramen. The broth was superrrr rich and very delicious! Toppings included fish cake (kamaboko), bamboo shoots, green onions, and pork belly. Everything was cooked to perfection and was ready pretty quickly. It was very convenient that you could look around the market or at the other stores while you waited for your order. Definitely recommend coming here! Will be sure to try a combo next time!"}, {"review_id": "3OJCssotRo-aswY2t8GHZw", "user_id": "-2ETDtjV_ujly9HckLhZMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "Absolutely delicious ramen, I LOVE Santouka. Probably my favorite ramen place that I've ever tried. Yes, the wait is crazy long and yes, they're cash only... but if you have the time to try it, it is so worth it! Luckily, I went during non-peak hours (around 4pm on a Sunday) so the wait wasn't too bad. Also, it's inside Mitsuwa market so you can walk around until your order is ready.The BROTH is what makes it -it is SO flavorful and rich and fatty and umami and just so on point! I wanted to drink the entire thing! The pieces of char siu are also well-cooked, tender, and flavorful. We ordered a spicy miso char siu ramen as well as a regular miso ramen with the salmon+roe side (combo). I can't reiterate enough how delicious it was... If it weren't for the long lines, I would probably visit more often.

The broth was delicious enough for me to not add any spices which I would normally do. I liked how not so soft the noodles were, I prefer that my noodles are still stiff. The wait was less than 10 minutes which was really good. The bad part of this location is that you have to wait for people to get out of the seating area since it is in a supermarket.Overall my experience was really good since I've been trying to find a ramen place that I enjoy.

Pro tip 1: CASH ONLY!I came here with my brother, Huryoung V. (I know...cute, matching names) on a Thursday evening for dinner. I've always known that the lines were long, so we came during the last 30 minutes of their hours.It was still pretty packed, but luckily no crazy lines! We waited about 25 minutes to order, and then waited another 15 minutes before we got our food. Pro tip 2: order the combo meals....it's cheaper than getting a bowl of noodles. Menu: separated into \"ramen\" or \"combo\". The menu font is SUPER tiny, so look at the menu online (aka my picture) before you come! They only have a display case (with no labeling) and 2 menus, which, is not being passed around.How to order:1) Pick from \"ramen\" menu or \"Combination\" menu2) Pick a base (salt, soy sauce, miso, spicy miso)3) Pick a type of \"ramen style\"/meat (regular, char siu aka extra pork, toroniku aka special pork)4) pick a size (S/M/L) 5) Add-ons or side dishes (extra charge)We ordered:1) #27: Medium, miso broth with toroniku ramen ($13.95) //+1 Would totally get the special pork again! Generous portion too.+1 I like that my toppings are on a separate plate, so you can add to your liking.+1 such creamy, rich broth! Love it.+1 Noodles/ramen are delicious! Chewy and eggy.2) #36: Large, spicy miso broth with char siu ramen ($14.95) //+1 Wow, nice kick! It looks red and tastes pretty flamin'! +1 A good amount of meat too.Service: pretty non-existent. You get the tray yourself, leave it on the table, and go on with your day.Overall, I would come here again if the wait wasn't so long. I would probably wait max 30 minutes."}, {"review_id": "SbpV6PDp5bFeMlThV3zvjw", "user_id": "CXl9uMlh4PTold4MxVku2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "This Ramen shop is inside the Mitsuwa Asian grocery store. We went here at 11 AM when they first opened on Saturday morning, however, the lines were still extremely long. The parking was easy though. When we got out, the parking lot was an absolute zoo. It took us about 45 to 50 minutes to wait in line and to get our food.Ordering is actually quite straightforward. Ramen bowls come in small, medium, and large sizes. You can choose from several broth styles including the traditional salt broth (shio), broth with soy, broth with miso, and broth with spicy miso. They have a very limited variety of add-ons such as extra pork, hard-boiled egg, and seaweed.One of the most popular options is the pork cheek. This comes on a separate plate. The pork cheek is extremely, extremely tender pork. DH got this option and said it was the highlight of the meal. \"It was worth it. I liked it a lot.\"DH ordered a medium salt broth Ramen with the pork cheek ($13.95). This was just about the right amount of food. Compared to other Ramen places, they seem to provide a lot of noodles. About 75% of the bowl is filled with noodles. It was a very dense meal. The shio broth is very clean tasting and slightly sweet.I ordered a medium miso broth Ramen for $10.95. I thought the highlight was definitely the extremely flavorful broth. It did seem to be quite salty near the end. I wished I could add just a touch of hot water to thin it out a bit. The super thick broth just had extreme depth of flavor, and a tremendous umami flavor. It did not seem to be too greasy, however, this is not healthy food by any stretch of the imagination. The ramen came with two slices of fatty pork, which were great, but not melt-in-your-mouth tender.The noodles are very good, nice and chewy, and went down easily. They are cooked to a medium firmness, and will get softer over time in the hot broth. They are not as soft as packaged ramen, and have a little bit of chewiness to it.Standard toppings include sliced green onion, a very cute pink and white swirled fish cake slice, preserved bamboo shoots, and finely sliced wood ear mushrooms. We opted for the add on hard-boiled egg for $1.50. I think we prefer the soft boiled eggs. This egg was fine and reminded us of tea smoked eggs. Be sure to put it in the broth to warm it up and give it extra flavor. We might skip the egg the next time. I wish they had more topping options.Since you're eating in a food court, you have to bus your own tables. They provide plastic cups for free water, which is a necessity, given the amount of sodium in this meal.Overall, this place is worth the hype, especially if you've ever been to Japan and had real ramen there. Just don't wait 'till you're too hungry to get in that insane line.CASH ONLY!!"}, {"review_id": "gc0HHzSvkwYkRbPwe58OLg", "user_id": "5gbkhlWANGVzQYi_0m3vOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Santouka is probably my favorite ramen spot in the Bay Area, despite not serving my favorite style of ramen noodle (the sqiggly type). Having visited numerous times here is some expert advice:* The line can often be long even on a weekday at 11:30am so be prepared to wait. If the line has wrapped past the cash register expect time to order and get food is approx. 1 hour. * All the broths are good - shio, soy, and miso. The miso and shio taste most closely alike so if you're sharing two flavors order the miso and soy. * Skip the rice bowls, very mediocre. * The \"special pork\" doesn't look special but tastes significantly better. It is truly *special* and worth the extra cost.* Smalls are dense and filling but I usually go for a regular."}, {"review_id": "tHF7i2QOYoyqRA9q907PzQ", "user_id": "xLsciKtGoO8_oHsQGM4Pqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "It was a rainy day so my friends and I were wanting ramen.

The only one that slightly beats it is in Tokyo. I've tried all the major players in the bay area (Orenchi, Ramen Dojo) and beyond (Momofuku, Ippudo in NYC). This beats them all. I always get the spicy miso ramen - the medium size is more than enough. Yes, it is salty, but this is how ramen is supposed to taste in my opinion. The noodles are always perfectly cooked and the broth is super flavorful. The line is long, so I'd recommend coming on a weekday night well before the store closes (inside Mitsuwa market, which closes at 8 PM, but sometimes they cut off the line well before that). There is usually only a short line.

It's a bit pricey, I'll admit for a noodle place inside a japanese supermarket. $14 for a regular sized bowl of ramen which consists of al dente noodles, bamboo shoots, green onion, char siu, and wood ear mushrooms. The broth does the magic of hitting the spot. The broth is creamy and flavorful, it has all the notes of savory that is just oh so good. I love to slurp my noodles and at the same time spoon some of the broth and eat them together. The only thing I don't like is that I hate waiting in a long line that snakes across the hall and then waiting some more after I order for my food.
