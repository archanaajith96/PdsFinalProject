My cousin was visiting from out of town and we decided to have lunch here as we were planning to walk around Old Town afterwards. It did not disappoint! Delicious!!!! My burger was cooked to perfection! They even made it lettuce wrapped at my request. Loved the sweet potato fries....my cousin had tater tots and they were crispy deliciousness!!!Even though it is a order at the counter set-up the staff was so attentive, checking up on us, refilling our drinks, clearing dirty plates etc..The owner was there at the same time we were there also. Such a pleasant gentleman! Had a great conversation with him.... he even had the staff bring us a complementary \"world famous \" blueberry pancake to try. It really was delicious!!!! I highly recommend eating here! I will be back!"}, {"review_id": "ZyQ2E12SwjkteM3t-2NnaA", "user_id": "eG0f-GvC-US3o6xURnqPRw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "We stopped into Central Grill for breakfast while passing through on a road trip and had a fantastic experience. The staff noticed we looked a little confused and must be first-timers, and were very friendly and helpful. They got started on making our drinks and suggested popular items while we got settled with printed menus to take our time deciding without blocking the ordering line.  Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly (traditional eggs benedict with hashbrowns and fruit, \"going bananas\" French toast). To top it off, the owner took an interest in us being out-of-towners and brought us an awesome sample of carne adovada with red and green chiles!Everyone we met there was genuinely friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "cvB3qDY0e3FOUJrzMlF7-A", "user_id": "p2PpidC2QHa9KVGVAVcxzA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Central Meh. Food was disappointing. Wife's tacos were a half-step above Taco Bell's. My Carne Adavada burrito was so-so. Its pulled pork was so water logged as to be mushy. Paid extra for it to be \"smothered\" which in this cast meant having a little green Chile poured over it and about a thimbleful of cheese melted on top. The coffee tasted like it was from a Keurig machine. We went there because of the high Yelp reviews. It did not approach those reviews."}, {"review_id": "ISPMVJq7l7duu0-8Aw_ebQ", "user_id": "ZV51rCTrfD-6_70YykqfAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "i couldn't get over the friendly, welcoming atmosphere that they staff puts on as soon as you step foot through the door. along with the lovely decor, what really put me over the top was the food. I ordered a grande pork burrito smothered in red and green chile, and man, they werent kidding when they call it grande! i honestly thought i wasnt going to be able to finish it, but it was too good to stop eating! and, it was relatively cheap, which made it even more enjoyable (for me, at least!) this place is a great spot to start your morning, and i absolutely recommend coming here!"}, {"review_id": "4k8WPOU61dH5jg8SuZPj4g", "user_id": "gFh-KwZQ7SwuOKcUVvEW3A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Cute diner.

Had no idea it was one of Albuquerque's most popular restaurants.Could never have predicted that this diner would serve one of the best wedge salads I've ever eaten. Not really a traditional wedge, but an improvement on the original. Fresh romaine lettuce leaves topped with thick crumbles of blue cheese, chopped tomato and bacon... with a side of creamy blue cheese dressing. Perfect.My sister had a Cobb salad that was so big she had to leave half of it. A half order would be plenty for her and most other people. Rarely have dessert at lunch, but couldn't resist their famous chocolate cake. So huge and rich that we could only get through a third of it, and worth every calorie. And the coffee is great.I don't normally like to stand in line to order my food, but I'd make an exception if I lived here."}, {"review_id": "5-o4zStz5KyBDKV0RgC11A", "user_id": "KOwdxDfWq1IGUZUKOTKToA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "The Central Grill and Coffee House is nothing fancy, but the food is dang good! If you want to have a great, sit-down, warm breakfast that won't take forever, this place is it! The huevos rancheros were out of this world just like the warm tortilla that came with it. The owner was so sweet; he came by to ask where we were visiting from and had us try one of his blueberry pancakes on the house. It's that sort of home town charm that makes this restaurant great!"}, {"review_id": "y3lOjvw3ndM4I87hMZjh9w", "user_id": "W5ZKFTGDZP28ZNPyexYFlg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I was in Albuquerque with my 4 young children and found Central Grill via Yelp. It sounded ideal for my young family. The staff was fantastically helpful and friendly and the owner offered up some awesome tips on things to do with the kids in the Albuquerque area, something the hotel staff, the Uber driver, and the van driver couldn't (or wouldn't) help me with!!!  To top off the experience, our breakfast was HUGE, delicious and a fantastic value.

The food is yummy though so I can see why. We didn't have to wait in line too long to order, we both ordered blueberry pancakes and some sort of sticky bun thing to share. I was pleasantly surprised at how affordable our meal was! Good quality food for very reasonable prices. It took a super long time for us to get our food but I'm sure that's just because of all of the people visiting for the balloon fest. Our favorite thing was the sticky bun. The bread part underneath was pretty good, but the toppings made it amazing! Pancakes were yummy too, so fluffy. We kinda wish we would've ordered the apples and Brie one though. The servers there were good too about being calm during the chaos in the restaurant, and checking up on us. I'd recommend this place, but wish I would've been able to try it at a less busy time!"}, {"review_id": "Jh1EXKwgI8nwxYUVQ6Jwtg", "user_id": "32r7y1MGHu5V1J4jlBHKPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "The owner made our trip spectacular.

Lots of vagrants in the area. So we go inside and the service is awesome. Very nice people, some of the best I've dealt with. The food was delicious, everything we had was really good.

This place gets packed on the weekends. I haven't had Seattle's Best coffee in a long time, so that was a nice change. Central Grill and Coffee House could do much better if it had wait service. No one really came to clean off the table except for when our plates were full of food. No, we're not done, but thank you!Their huevos rancheros were fantastic as were the banana french toast. That has to be the best french toast I've had in Albuquerque. It didn't even need the maple syrup on top, the bananas were plenty. I didn't like that the food took a whole half hour (especially at breakfast). Our experience was okay, just good to know what to expect next time."}, {"review_id": "35V94-rLVpAVhMSKgcY0zA", "user_id": "gbYRTrsUBUqX3tfYKH7TuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "This place is fabulous!  Owner stops at tables to ask how everything is. Food is delicious.  We had half sandwich and green Chile soup.  Mmmmmm!Sandwiches were hot and nummy. Pastrami (hubby) and roasted turkey for me. Delicious. Just saw the owner asking someone if they'd like more bacon. They said sure. He was back in a minute. More bacon!  The guys looked at each other, smiled, shrugged, and dug in!  Told him I loved the soup. He said he couldn't give me the recipe (natch) but showed me the frozen Chile's they used and told me where I could get them. So thoughtful!Wow!  He just gave us a delicious blueberry pancake with REAL MAPLE SYRUP!  Melts in your mouth! Definitely try one!!I would highly recommend this restaurant. We travel a lot and it is difficult to find local food. This one is local and scrumptious.

Well, it was close to the  botanical gardens which worked out well. Upon walking in I really dig the outside pavilion and the interior design work. The flooring is nice and the brick fascia with a stainless steel countertop is great. Everything is clean and the place smells of fresh baked goods. I ordered my usual steak and eggs. The variety of baked goods were sooooo tempting but I have to hold off until a formal cheat day. The food arrived promptly cooked to perfection.

Pancakes for the kids, eggs Benedict and their world famous burrito for the adults. I had my burrito with eggs and chorizo, cheese and papas and red chili sauce poured on top. Lord. Have. Mercy!
