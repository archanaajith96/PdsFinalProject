Good!  The other thing that caught my eye, which I ordered and squandered away for the next day - a chocolate cupcake with peanut butter buttercream frosting.  Dense, moist and delicous, it was so fantastic I am tasting it in my dreams.One of the things I really like about the Comet is it's unique, friendly, neighborhood feel.  The staff are welcoming and hospitable, you seat yourself, and when you look around you see people having fun, enjoying what suits them.I've had many great meals here, from bacon pancakes, to brunch, to deep fried Thanksgiving Dinner and fish fry, to drinks, and let us not forget the desserts of pie and cupcakes.  It's all good, people!"}, {"review_id": "tVDxoo49nJF7xy2uLGQjOg", "user_id": "F84EKvVYPDJLm5_9ta6g3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "This is my new favorite Milwaukee restaurant, hands down. Amazing vegetarian/vegan options that you literally wouldn't even know were vegan. So refreshing, and great service too!One minor negative: We were seated right next to the door, and it was extremely cold while there was a large group in the doorway waiting to be seated for nearly 20 minutes. I felt overwhelmed as it felt like this group was standing literally on top of us. My advice: Avoid sitting at the table right next to the door."}, {"review_id": "lBGFN5IZTTbZx0VwPNwoLw", "user_id": "Kbz9G5UuXcDDKt7o8mI0nA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "A perennial favorite of mine.  The food is always rich, filling, and pretty high quality.  My favorite items are the compact turkey dinner, the tuekenstein sandwich, the meatloaf, and the grilled cheese.  I don't love their breakfast, but their bacon is very good.  The beer list is one of the better ones in the city.  They also have cupcakes and pie for desert.  Lots of vegan options, although I like the ones with dairy more.  The servers have all been there a long time and are very friendly.  A great place for lunch with some of the best fries in Milwaukee."}, {"review_id": "7LAmMoZfIFe4AHJKVuyOEA", "user_id": "ziYUenaeKLechx8j4P4CDA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "I've only visited Comet Cafe once and that was later in the evening after attending a comedy show in Milwaukee.  We chose Comet Cafe as our late night stop based on Yelp reviews.  Comet Cafe clearly has a positive following.  When dining out, so often the respective location is either a hit or a miss.Comet Cafe is clean on the inside with that old school but yet fresh vibe. Our server was attentive throughout our meal.  It was somewhat loud and seemed there was an identity crisis of whether the place wants to be a bar or cafe.We each ordered the meatloaf dinner (meatloaf, veggies & mashed potatoes). My wife enjoyed her meal while I didn't care for the tangy taste of the sauce that covered the meat.I would not say the positive reviews for Comet Cafe are off, but this place was just a miss for my personal preferences in a late evening Cafe."}, {"review_id": "g-X2xsur-2QZa-YRYBwyOg", "user_id": "PoAc1N3GaOeWdBVSFsleig", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Comet Cafe serves up some delectable diner food for all palates. My group of omnivores, sometimes vegetarian, and strict vegan was all satisfied here. The ambiance was casual-hipster, without too much hipsterness (thankfully). Service was prompt but we did wait a while for our food to arrive. All of our entrees were delicious and we struggled to finish. (My greatest regret of March 2018 was accidentally leaving the other half of my reuben in my hotel fridge.)I was excited for the dessert options, but the only vegan dessert left that wasn't a cupcake was a mixed fruit pie. We were also disappointed that a diner-type of restaurant didn't have any milkshakes. Maybe that isn't a thing in Wisconsin.Regardless, if I'm ever back in Milwaukee, I'll make a good effort to find myself back at Comet Cafe. The food was great and thanks to technology such as Uber, not difficult to get to at all."}, {"review_id": "yfy0l406D-MqBIJAE0FH8Q", "user_id": "iZ5ZNXP0ZyA7HEmWvKWjZg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Recently had a late lunch at Comet.  My wife loves this place although being new to town, it was the first time for me.  It was 3PM so we didn't have to wait for seating which was nice.  We settled into a big, comfortable booth and ordered.  An iced tea for my wife along with a Turkey Reuben and the Big Johnson burger for me.  My wife also ordered a side of beer cheese for our fries.  The Turkey Reuben was good.  The turkey was fresh, plenty of cheese and kraut.  The only part that my wife said she'd change is that the rye bread had salty crust.  I mean, really, really salty crust.  Distracted from the goodness of the sandwich.  I really enjoyed Big Johnson.  The burger was thick and juicy; almost hard to bite into. Came with gouda, lettuce, tomatoes and peppercorn mayo (also onions, but I asked for the burger without them). The fries were natural cut and crispy.  My wife loved them.  I thought they were good, but a little salty.  The beer cheese was a nice touch for the fries.  Not something you want to do every time, but once in awhile, why not?  Service was efficient and friendly.  Asking for the Reuben with turkey instead of steak was not a problem in the least which was appreciated.  Prices were decent.  Not the cheapest place, but not terrible either.  And portions were more than adequate.  We left completely stuffed.  The ambiance was good - a little funky.  Neither my wife or I are fans of chain restaurants (although we end up at them from time to time), so we always appreciate places that groove to their own beat.  And, we appreciated the many vegan/vegetarian options on the menu.  There's truly something for everyone at Comet."}, {"review_id": "r2gWvx0TF1Z1QcqfmtZevQ", "user_id": "FUgdITkYCgeSLf01zxZ6dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "This was one of the highlights of our Spring Break 2018 visit to Milwaukee. We ended up going here for brunch since we had already visited Cafe Benelux the day before, and I am happy we did.This unassuming diner sits on the corner and when you walk in, there's nothing that strikes you as fantastic, other than the carnival of smells in your nose: fresh coffee, pancakes, bacon.We took a seat in a booth. A guy sitting on the bar next to us looked EXACTLY the same as Ed Sheeran. My kids were asking me if it was him... I couldn't tell if it really was him, but it was a darn good doppelganger. Moving on to the brunch...Our server was great. He promptly and courteously asked us for our drinks of choice. Their coffee is amazeballs! I was told Anodyne Roasters makes a special blend for them. Later we got our order... Omelette, bacon pancakes, some pesto b'fast sandwich, ham and eggs.My omelette was really, really good. I asked mine with a side of grilled sliced tomatoes instead of b'fast potatoes --which I tried from my wife's plate anyway. My wife's pesto sandwich was awesome as well. But what took the cake was the bacon pancakes my kids ordered. They were fluffy, and savory, and HUGE! We enjoyed every bite and we even had one left over and in a box.Ambiance was great, decor was great, prompt service, awesome food and coffee and fair price. What else can you ask for?!?Go here.

Since that first visit, that dish has haunted my dreams. That was in September. I haven't been able to go back to Comet for various reasons: their kitchen is closed when I go or there's a crowd outside waiting to be seated. It's clear that Comet is incredibly popular. I would LOVE to go back and meticulously analyze that macaroni and cheese, but it'll have to be at an odd dinner hour to beat the crowd."}, {"review_id": "pHLkaauee2Fdv_3D8dnwjQ", "user_id": "T8e-Z11DHW2eX71yxNG-_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "I always pass this place but never came in...then I saw they have some awesome vegan/vegetarian options! :) The decor is interesting,I would probably just describe it overall as very hipster/vintage. For dinner I sat at the bar and ordered the Asian tofu sandwich. Forgive me for not remembering the name, but it was good. The bartender actually convinced me to get it, opposed to the vegan Salisbury steak. I was pleasantly surprised at how much tofu is on this sandwich! I had to take some off.. lol Overall good experience and customer service. I will be back for sure because they have a crazy dessert menu with more vegan options! :)"}, {"review_id": "p4pe2qDicDzIlwkIJOux7A", "user_id": "8EZbaTp4JQgaYa0wlyn9FQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "The mac n cheese is amazing but the amount I got when I ordered take-out is so sad!!

Have heard SO much about this place, mainly from my vegetarian/vegan friends, so I figured I might as well try it out. We came here for brunch. There was about a 20 minute wait for seating, and no great place to wait, which is kind of a pain during Wisconsin winters.However, all was forgiven once we sat down to eat. To my surprise and great enjoyment, Comet has a fantastic amount of veg and non-veg items. I had The Stendler (essentially a delectable breakfast burrito with corned beef as the meat), and my cousin had the Tofu Scramble. I honestly liked her meal as much as mine, which says a lot about the quality of Comet's options. On top of that, they have a great cocktail menu, with creative drinks and classic staples. Our service (we were at the bar) was great, and everyone was very friendly.All in all, this is going to become a mainstay of my Milwaukee brunch options. Looking forward to trying out Comet for dinner as well."}, {"review_id": "tsky-Uvwgcp6MSEvbhN8-A", "user_id": "WqLselafOhdyuEtZmbWsjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "While I was visiting the city, I came across this little vegan gem.

I haven't been able to keep my mind off of the Comet lately. I went for brunch a few weeks ago and had the most delicious sandwich.

I had to go back a few weeks later when my friend was in town from the Twin Cities. Everyone enjoyed their meal and we were seated immediately. I ordered the BELT, very delicious, as usual.

I knew Comet was good but I haven't had much patience to wait dine there. When you drive by and mass amounts of people are waiting outside it's a little discouraging. But I guess the jokes on me because OMG yum. Today we decided to brave it and go for brunch. I am on a mission to use all of my city tins before the end of the year and this was one of the stops. We waited for about 20 mins and got seats at the counter. Our server came to take our drink order and we both wanted to test out the bloodies. They are pretty decent tasting bloodies and come garnished with bacon, olives, pickles, green beans and a Surly chaser. We both asked our neighbors what they were eating before deciding on what to order. Both of their breakfast dishes looked amazing and we thought why think about what to order when these people have already done the work for us. I got the chilaquiles and my boyfriend got the breakfast burrito with sausage inside. Oh my gosh! All the food arrived and it was so so so good! I'm glad I got the chilaquiles, all the flavors were so good I didn't want to stop eating. My boyfriend really enjoyed his burrito as well.I will be back to eat more meals at Comet.

Let me tell ya. There is usually a slight wait to get a table, especially during the dinner hours and parking can be kinda tricky. But man was the wait and struggle to park worth it. I had heard great reviews of the VEGAN options at Comet Café so I knew I had to give it a try. Believe it or not, even though the wait was slightly long, the food came out really fast. Now, the vegan options Comet Café offer aren't your typical. I'm talking Salisbury steak. Yes, Salisbury steak with veggies and mashed potatoes. And guess what? It's vegan and it takes really good. If there were a perfect description to describe Comet Café I would say hip diner. The food is not the healthiest for you but they've got vegan options and an urban environment. I would say it's the spin on the typical diner.

Came back a year later and we found the food to be average. My wife and son got Bacon Pancakes: they could have got 1 pancake each and been full but we recalled the ones last year and each wanted 2 cakes. I had the burrito and it was good: I liked the spicy sour cream and it was full of eggs (it was like 3-4 eggs in the shell).Service was great, and that is nice to see, but the food seems to have slipped. They offered to remake the Pancakes but my wife declined. She said the year earlier the Pancakes had strips of Bacon and this time it was just sprinkled inside. I thought the burrito was good; they had sautéed onions but some peppers or other stuff would have helped. Overall it was a meal but I can't say we will be back for breakfast. They were very kind and they did not charge us for one order of the Bacon Pancakes."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/comet-caf%C3%A9-milwaukee-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
