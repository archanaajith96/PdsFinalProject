It was an interesting flavor and I thought it could work on some Jambalaya. Next time we go to Maddie's Place I will give it a shot.  The ladies at the table ordered the bread pudding for dessert and we ordered the peanut butter pie.  Both were delicious.  Overall, we had a fantastic time at Maddie's Place.  The service was really above what we expected and the food was very good.  Excellent date night restaurant!!"}, {"review_id": "NHC8H-MCwuyfMZLa1k7GTQ", "user_id": "NzVyhONQ5naUYjQEVYJLZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2018", "text": "Food: 4.5/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 4/5Value: 3.5/5------Stopped in here for dinner with friends. High expectations since my friend called it his \"new absolute favorite place in Little Rock.\" All expectations met and exceeded, to be honest!We had the boudin balls for starters, and I had the catfish po'boy for entree. Dessert was bread pudding. All AMAZING. Boudin balls had the perfect texture and comes with a side of mustard. Catfish in the po'boy was cooked perfectly crispy but tender, with a side of the perfect skinny fries. Bread pudding doused in syrup, comes out piping hot. Friends also ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and shrimp and grits. I've never had such juicy fried whole piece chicken breast. Service was friendly and on point, and the place itself has a great balanced feel of nice and divey. Pricing isn't anything to rave about, but not bad. Will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "6YUNkwvVQkHIp0b7frqTiQ", "user_id": "roX7y1hFe7giszstp7ZpDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Delicious food, reasonably priced, quick service, personable staff, nice atmosphere.

Even if you have to wait do it!!  My husband and I went to Little Rock for my birthday weekend. We had to wait about 20 min. At 6:40 pm so go early. Rebecca was our server and she took care of us like we were her only customers. (They were packed so that wasn't the case.)We ordered  alligator bites to start and the sweet and sour dipping sauce was perfect with the spice of the bites. My husband and I both ordered grilled salmon with roasted garlic grits. I had Brussel sprouts and he had turnip greens. Because neither of us is a big fan of stewed okra, which is how it is listed in the menu. The grits were so creamy and delicious. My Brussel sprouts were good too. My husband said not the best greens he's ever had but they were good. Salmon was seasoned with Cajun spices and it was really great. After dinner we had pecan pie with ice cream. I would just get the ice cream. I wasn't a fan of the pecan pie. It had a graham cracker crust that wasn't all that great.   But I am dessert picky so you might think it's great!!Seriously yummy people. Plug the address in to your gps and go there early so you don't have to wait for all this yummyness!!"}, {"review_id": "MbxiL3SoBrD3_myGPbS1rQ", "user_id": "HA13fGbhE4fausv8ZCs8JA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Everytime I get to Little Rock I always go to Maddie's and have pork nachos which are always beyond belief great."}, {"review_id": "3SASGIkbU3GcA1NxvKaSsQ", "user_id": "D2lFTO77U1dLEVCoPK1nfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Amazing cuisine!

But, I had to shave a couple of stars off based on the food. So my friend ordered the fried chicken (basically a boneless breaded chicken breast) with greens and macNcheese. The chicken was 5 stars all the way!! Perfectly juicy & tender with the right amount of crunch from the bread crumbs! The greens were way too bitter for this Southerner. I like mine spicy. So...3/5 for me on the greens. The mac was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but pretty good. NEXT friend ordered the fried green tomatoes with crabmeat!  The...bomb! Period! I will get them next time!! FINALLY I ordered the steak special. A $28 16oz ribeye. I was LUCKY to get 8 ounces out of that steak! It was literally 50% fat (you'll see in the picture)!! The grotesquely fatty steak is the #1 reason I gave 3 stars. But it came with blanched green beans (bleh) & truffle fries! I would have probably paid $28 for those effing fries!!! They were freaking AHHHH-mazing!!"}, {"review_id": "obTYP4PRf76V8TGKZgcmgA", "user_id": "j1WNonmiPMXXBoEVppp0zA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "Enjoyed a nice dinner with family last night.

The dining area is somewhat small, but looks to be well maintained. This seems to be a popular spot. I ordered the half jambalaya with added seafood. It did not disappoint! Very spicy, though just a tad too sweet for my taste. I am not sure how spicy jambalaya should be, but I am enjoying the kick.First impression is good, the wait staff were friendly and helpful.

I was super excited when the waitress told us about their grilled oysters since I find it really hard to find them in Little Rock. Some of them were a little small but they were seasoned well and delicious. I went went the grilled red fish with grits and green beans and it was amazing! The portion size of fish was very generous and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Being born and bred in the south, I take my grits very seriously and these did not disappoint. They were so good, I could have eaten a entire bowl by myself. My husband ordered the buttermilk chicken with green and mac and cheese and said it was excellent.

At that dinner, we drank, we laughed, and I had Alligator for the first time in the form of \"Fried Gator Bites\" dipped in a smooth, spicy BBQ sauce that was life-changing!And then, just last week, I found that place again!This little joint is every inch the old-town New Orleans food shack that it tries to be, from the colorful old brick, the sense of age - the kinds that's well-loved and still fun - right on down to the charming, friendly foodie staff.You're looking at snazzy Cajun/Creole food here. Spicy, flavorful, varied and made with love. The ingredients are all home-made, and largely locally sourced if I'm not mistaken. The menu is chock-full of a dizzying variety of different items, be aware for those folks who have trouble making decisions.The beer and wine selection were equally overwhelming, with a big printed menu, and a large rotating specials chalkboard on top. In keeping with the theme, they try to stock as many Louisiana brews as they can, with more Abita varieties than I've ever even heard of, and a number of others you can't find many places. I particularly enjoyed the Bayou Tech Roasted Ale, personally, something I hadn't seen anywhere else. But let's get back to that food! I tried those Gator Bites, with the aforementioned life-changing sauce. I also really enjoyed the fried redfish in crawfish etouffee (spectacular cheese grits!), the Garlic Truffle Fries were generous and super-garlicky (although you do have to ask for sauce), and the Andouille Sausage Jambalaya is awesome! ...Had a half order of that one, and it was plenty :)The place itself is nice, if informal. It's set up like a bar restaurant, with a combination of tall tables and small booths, but the lighting and ambiance give it a more social and intimate feel than that setup normally does.There are two dings, but those didn't slow me down at all:1. Most dishes include meat, meat sauce, or meat bits, and not all of them say so on the menu. Meat lovers rejoice! Vegetarians beware!2. It's a little on the pricey side, with even half-orders running around the $10 mark. It's worth it, but once you've had some, you'll want more, and that racks up fast!"}, {"review_id": "eELYQshGaDp8Q6LF_Z2vyQ", "user_id": "k15O7Q5piGClOdFVOyKatw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The place appears to be popular.  The cuisine is Cajun. We \"lucked out\" with a booth by the door during peak PM time. I thought we were off to a good start with the server as we were greeted quickly with water in hand. That was the last of the timely service. To her defense she had a party of eight at the time. Yet, we were seated next to them.  Even after they left she seemed to disappear. She was cheerful and did bus the table with each visit. The service overall was inattentive. The food was hit and miss. The fried green tomatoes were good. The lump crab meat on top is a wonderful addition. It needed more remoulade sauce. The bacon and tomato bisque was a disastrous disappointment. My wife loves tomato bisque and she could barely swallow the first bite. I soldiered thru with vast quantities of saltines to mask the overwhelming bacon grease. The shrimp po'boy was good. We spilt everything and it arrived already divided onto two plates. A nice touch. The creme brûlée was kind of thin and more egg custard like, not like others we have had. It had a nice caramelized crust. Parking is a squeeze in the lot shared by the Faded Rose. By 8 o'clock the place was pretty well cleared, so I would recommend going later.  Not sure I would venture back. They totaled my bill incorrectly as well."}, {"review_id": "AW9Otq9x57xxGrvUrYSSfw", "user_id": "O_vzjrNEOAbmrG7gcufR3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "Looooooooove their shrimp and grits!
