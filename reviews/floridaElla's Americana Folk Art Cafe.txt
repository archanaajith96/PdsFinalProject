Our table of 10 had reservations but we still had to wait 15 minutes for them to set the table up.  Apparently it was busy at 8:00 and I we arrived at 9:00.  We ended up outside, and though it was a nice night, every gust of wind brought debris raining down from the trees above.  We got into the habit of covering our food like WW2 veterans after a few rounds or mortars.Recommended dishes- Short rib with carrots over fettuccini - the short ribs were braised until they fell off the bone and served with a wine reduction sauce over fresh made pasta.  Served in a bowl and sprinkled with goat cheese. Rich and satisfying.- Tuna Tartare Tacos - Although small and only an appetizer they were tasty with just enough miso drizzle and a mild cilantro slaw to satisfy a light meal. - Shrimp toasts - think of a crab cake with a toast bottom all deep fried.  We cut them in Hal and shared.Overall, besides the waits for both our table and the food Ella's delivered a nice combination of fun artsy environment with some tasty new dishes.  -"}, {"review_id": "A411v0ZV6aPmR-s4EAgrcw", "user_id": "AqkA3kv1MA51YhTMd_HLlg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Too 3 brunch locations of all time for me!  My review is only for their Soul Food Sundays, so I am not familiar with their weekday menu.Location: Not too far from 275 so getting there isn't difficult.  Parking could be an issue at certain busier times, but we have not had that issue going a little after the typical brunch window.Service: Great friendly staff with menu knowledge and helpful if you need any recommendations.  Everyone seems to enjoy working there and the atmosphere is very upbeat!  There are indoor and outdoor seating options as well as a 2nd floor, but this place is very popular **SO ADD YOURSELF TO THE YELP WAITLIST** ahead of time and you won't have to wait more than 10 minutes after arriving.Food: My first visit I started with their signature bloody mary! If you like spice and a nice alcoholic kick in your bloody mary like I do, you will enjoy it!  Not to mention they include a whole rib on top of your drink!  My entree selection was the biscuits and gravy!  They were delicious with chorizo and fluffy biscuits. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles which were some of the best I have had.  The chicken was crunchy, juicy, and came with several pieces. The portion size was great for me, but for others you could probably take some home.  I have also tried their BBQ which I enjoyed but prefer their more brunch-related items.  I would say the standout in their BBQ menu is the ribs.  If you want some great side item recommendations I would go with the fried pickles or green tomatoes!I did have one critique for their greens side item.  If you enjoy your greens with vinegar like I do, I would ask to try the greens before ordering them.  They have a sweetness to them which wasn't really for me.Aside from that, this place is very deserving of a 5 and I will be going back many times in the future."}, {"review_id": "Cjn6PeSWBZcgLSJmx14lvQ", "user_id": "T5alzFNQN0DIu0J6CbHkQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I just went to this restaurant for the first time on a Sunday for brunch.  The first thing I noticed was the art that was all around the venue, additionally we realized that the outdoor space was beautiful as well.

We used the get in line app through yelp and worked out perfectly. There is only a small parking lot behind the building which fills up quick, be sure to read the signs posted on where you can and cannot park to avoid getting towed. The weather was perfect and we brought along our two pups so we opted for the outside patio seating. There are little folk art and creations spread across the area. My guest ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered the grilled fresh catch of the day (Cobia) with some mimosas. Our food came out around 20 minutes later and was presented well. The chicken and waffles should be called chickens and waffle lol due to only coming with one waffle and three pieces of fried chicken. My fish was cooked well, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. It was a pretty healthy and refreshing meal with the dirty rice and spicy tomato sauce. Although the size of the fish was a bit small compared to the portion of rice. The fried chicken was unexpectedly amazing. The breading and the flavor of the chicken was simply unmatched by any fast food fried chicken chain. If you're in the mood for some bomb fried chicken I would highly recommend this dish. Overall it's a pretty cool spot, kind of hipster. They have their own liquor menu and cocktails which looked intriguing. This is also one of the stops on the brew bus. I would recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. Make sure to utilize the get in line feature for fast and easy accommodations!"}, {"review_id": "Lk3xaMg9Uv_TTT6UxGdA5g", "user_id": "-kLVfaJytOJY2-QdQoCcNQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Brunch was good, but nothing blew me out of the park. I sometimes roll my eyes when someone goes to say a steakhouse, orders a squash dish, and then says well the squash was mediocre so don't go here. Don't go to an Indian restaurant and order spaghetti, don't go to a Greek restaurant and ask for sushi - you get the idea. However, I know there will always be people who are tempted to get the salad or the healthy dish. I will slowly raise my hand to being that person. So although I know you go to Ella's for their soul food Sundays, not for a salad, I'll still write the review for those green lovers out there. Jumping right in, I found the Southern Spring Salad good, but not great. It is a perfectly solid salad, there just isn't anything spectacular about it. That being said, I would definitely order it again and I would absolutely come here again. The fact that others can get their fried chicken and waffle fix while I nosh on greens makes it a perfect brunch place for me. My friend got the Funky Monkey Waffle. It is definitely on the smaller side, but it is also on the cheaper side so this is a case of you get what you pay for. If you're starving don't order it, or get it to split with a friend! Another friend got the veggie burger and said it was the best veggie burger she has ever had. That's a pretty strong statement so I might try the veggie burger next time.Ella's uses nowait so you can put yourself in line before you even get there from the Yelp app! Nobody should have an excuse for waiting for a long time to be seated!There is an upstairs, where we sat, so there is more seating than it looks like at first glance. At noon on a Sunday we didn't have any problems getting a table."}, {"review_id": "BwOBommLWrqiDsk2JJ5WYw", "user_id": "AnqnKl8mKPDu1Plg4Ni8OA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I love going to soul food Sunday.

The cornbread is really good when it's brought to the table straight out of the oven. I would recommend using the yelp waitlist before going.

The atmosphere is a little loud but hip, art-deco inspired and the service staff all have this \"Cool Hand Luke\" vibe about them, easy like Sunday morning. The food is true soul food, chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, Ribs/BBQ, fried green tomatoes, Mac n' cheese, collard greens (just to name a few AND all pictured included) and the portions are larger.  So come hungry!!!  And thirsty, so you can wash it all down with gigantic flavored mimosas ($10 BTW and basically all champagne, just like I like 'em) or a spicy Bloody Mary, made with house made pepper infused vodka for an extra kick and topped with.....WAIT FOR IT....one of their famous ribs!!! I've been there for girlfriends brunch, dates and just-cause catching up, and Ella's just has it all for any type of group...great food, fun environment, no-holds barred cocktails...and if you happen to carry \"brunch\" over into the later afternoon, like I often have, you get live jazz music to boot!!!  A great spot to spend your Sunday!"}, {"review_id": "q-33tGrV_ktsj-2WmYCvTw", "user_id": "iJA_kuBCS5MqBa8Ra2_zaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "AMAZING!

I am writing my review based on the Sunday brunch, as I haven't been there any other time (yet!).I have heard amazing things about Ella's Sunday brunch and I'm so happy to have been able to finally have experienced it! My friend and I went around 11:30, shortly after they opened, and the wait time was about 30 minutes. We sat out in the Adirondack chairs and our wait went by fairly quickly! I'm not sure if you are able to request to sit out on the patio, but once our table was ready we went inside and sat upstairs. Ella's is huge and has so many fun things to look at! My friend ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato fries (which she said was pretty great) and I ordered the catfish with bacon Mac and cheese and fried green tomatoes. The server also said you could get the Mac and cheese without bacon, but bacon is life for me. If you've read some of my previous reviews, I'm all about the whole massive portion thing (probably my Texan coming out), and Ella's did pretty well! I do wish I had more fried green tomatoes, because they were so yummy!! However the mac n cheese was A LOT for one person. The catfish had a yummy breading, and came with a nice tartar sauce.We also made the mistake of ordering a pitcher of sangria for ourselves (although it could be a fantastic thing for people who are better at that )! The pitcher felt bottomless; I think we got about 6 full large glasses out of it. It was delicious, and my stomach was extra full.Our server was so nice and friendly, and we had a great time chatting with her when she came to our table!My only regret is that left my take out box at the table, because I would have loved to eat the rest of it all over again!"}, {"review_id": "v4DIE9dqnAD_WCzoIMij0Q", "user_id": "7SKwy6chO_FgWti1jK31TA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "Met up with Yelp Friends here the other night. What a great choice! Ella's has such a creative vibe. The artwork is through out the restaurant and is so innovative and fun. The whole set up of the restaurant is so cute. I believe it is in an old home. You can eat inside or outside on the huge deck. Inside they have a full bar and stage for live musical acts. Due to the heat, we opted to sit inside (Just a heads up: Ella's does not take reservations for groups under 8 people but they do call ahead seating via Yelp).I had surveyed their menu online as I didn't want to waste everyones time having to decide what to eat (I get options paralysis). Once our super friendly and well informed waitress came over and told us the specials, everything had changed for me. Ella's cooks in small batch and all the ingredients are well thought out and fresh. I immediately decided to get the sea scallop special. I couldn't believe I was at a two $$ restaurant! Ella's is truly gourmet. The Sea Scallops were topped with crispy bacon and corn bread crumbles, heirloom tomatoes marinated in their own Bloody Mary recipe, and combined with homemade smoked corn ice cream! I was in heaven! And what better to accompany such fine food but a great drink. Ella's truly knows their wine. I ordered the \"middle of the road\" Chardonnay, Chloe from Sonoma, CA. Normally I am skeptical of California wines. The Chloe Chardonnay has changed my view. It was robust with full flavor, yet dry and not overly sweet. And What a pour! Worth every dollar spent. I cannot say enough good things about this place. My friends and I shared the Arugula and Pesto Hummus with fresh veggies. It was so delicious! Even those skeptical about hummus in general were scooping it on their plates. After finishing our meals around 10pm (never being rushed on a busy Friday night), the band began to play. Such great blues and rock mixed with folk. I will definitely be returning for dessert, cocktails and music!"}, {"review_id": "krp7XZmZJPStExbnR0cPbQ", "user_id": "fVInqfUrm52KCpAGuEc6Sw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "My friend and I came here for brunch for the first time and ordered the shrimp and grits, mac & cheese, and chicken and waffles. I wasn't too impressed with the chicken and waffles because the batter kept falling off the chicken in big chunks and it wasn't very crispy. Sometimes you had to take bites of the chicken and grab the fried crust with it that had fallen off. You don't really get the full feeling of satisfaction of biting into crunchy and crispy fried chicken like you should. It didn't taste bad though. The mac & cheese was above average, but I have had better. It wasn't exactly a blast of flavor that I had expected when I first saw it. Now the shrimp & grits is where it's at! This is probably the BEST shrimp and grits I've ever tasted in my life!!! It made me feel like all the other times I've ever had it, they got it all wrong and this is how it should taste! The consistensy of the grits were very smooth and the acidity of the tomatoes balanced out the heaviness of the carb-loaded grits. The shrimps were cooked perfectly, adding just that extra chewy and unique flavor to bring the dish together."}, {"review_id": "qMWLOAE1XC7xakU-3LHI-Q", "user_id": "dLQO5zphIApsiAFKTo8dZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/6/2017", "text": "Great Vibe, Great Food, Great Music, Great Drinks!This place rocks on so many levels. First off, super cool vibe whether you sit inside or out. Funky and fresh without being pretentious. The service is really good too. We came on a busy Friday night and never felt rushed. Our server was friendly and informative.The food tasted homemade with loads of my favorite secret ingredient, love. Started with a hummus platter and fresh vegan bread. Arugula pesto hummus was the evenings fresh batch and it tasted phenomenal with the provided veggies. The vegan bread was warm, soft and fresh. The choices for main course were slim, but there was something for everyone. Seafood, meat, chicken, pizza, vegan... all the bases were covered. I went with the meatloaf plate. It was packed with veggies, mashed potatoes, onion rings and a HUGE slice of meat loaf. Best mashed potatoes ever tied this comfort food favorite together. By the end of our meal a live band started playing. Jazzy, bluesy and just downright good music was a great way to finish the night. It looks like a lot of people come for the later portion of the evening to grab a drink, snack or dessert.

This being despite showing up five minutes early for the 335 reservation I made online, which told me to arrive and check in with the host only to have wait an additional half an hour, if not longer on the front porch in the sweltering August heat and humidity until I got the call from a NJ number.Much to my amazement the wait and bake turned out to be worthwhile after all. My meal consisted of the itis; I chose the brisket and ribs, which were amazing, as my two meats with a side of the most creamy and delicious cheese grits I've ever tasted. And of course I couldn't resist the bacon Mac and Cheese. That in itself deserves a review all on its own. It was so ooey, gooey, and dripping with cheese and bits of real bacon. I'm salivating at the thought. In addition to that the red beans and rice was perfection. Far better than that fast food, fried chicken franchise that shall remain nameless; just saying! I don't know who Ella's has working in their kitchen, but they definitely can throw down. Lastly, kudos to the host, don't recall her name, sorry; she was so friendly and polite and showed up just in the nick of time, before my frustrations got the best of me and I left without having their must have brunch. Dylan, the waiter, was also phenomenal; he was very pleasant,  friendly and attentive. It's amazing food and awesome customer service that makes me give this place five stars, something I've never done before for any establishment.Can't wait to return."}, {"review_id": "tNoKk5kGN_oEKT5RrLLrjw", "user_id": "Iowfqp6cpjk8qNtYHRaJ6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Such a fun outdoor area with comfortable seating!

First off the service was really great-- our waitress was friendly, enthusiastic, and very helpful on recommendations. For appetizers we had the tuna tacos and fries (more potato wedges) which were both super good. I especially liked the tuna tacos in wonton taco shells. My fiancé shared his chili and corn bread with me and it was delicious. He ordered the pork chop which was highly recommended by our table and our waitress. We don't usually eat pork chops since honestly they're usually not anything special but he decided to take the chance. It was smoked, juicy and just straight up delicious!! I can't believe how good a pork chop could be... like I would order that over a perfect steak even.. that good!! I was having a hard time deciding what to order until the waitress read off the specials. I got one of the specials of the night. It was a short rib in a wine tomato sauce and I think butternut squash. I ate too much because I couldn't stop. The short rib was cooked perfectly. The pasta was yummy and the whole thing was perfectly sauced. The decor is eclectic and fun as well!
