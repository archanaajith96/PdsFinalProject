Upon arrival, I discovered that the line was out the door. It stayed this way for the entire time I was there. The whole store is quite small, I would only recommend sitting down to eat if you must. You're not likely to find a place to sit.I ended up getting an insane amount of sweets because I just couldn't decide. The donuts had a texture that I don't think I've ever tasted before. They were brioche-y but very filling. The coffee cake was good, a little dry for my taste. The legendary cinnamon roll was exactly that. A few seconds in the microwave really made this one perfect.I now understand why the line was out the door. Although I am fortunate enough to not have any gluten/soy/etc allergies, there are many that do. It's a HUGE bonus that they are conscious of these allergies. And it's all organic, double win!"}, {"review_id": "GZ7slbqodP5EJ_WGVSU61w", "user_id": "syc0AhTzma0s1EMKQ9V8mQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "This place is incredible. Their doughnuts are always fresh, the cinnamon rolls are the best in Jacksonville, and the salter caramel brownie bites are to die for.My only suggestion for improvements would be to get rid of the massive table inside the facility and install some ropes to snake the line around a few times, like the lines found at a fast food joint or a roller coaster or something. Currently, almost every time we have been here the line has been some weird, awkward U shape that causes a lot of people some serious confusion.Food wise, though, Sweet Theory is a 10/10."}, {"review_id": "YDS7VjJx096_oyskZAt-Xw", "user_id": "x_Vo6Z1nvWgGHkHeQrLWrw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "First time here, staff was awesome very cute inside - prices prettt reasonable for vegan bakery items, my chocolate frosted donut was pretty great as well, but the one thing i was moist excited for were the cupcakes but they weren't as moist as other vegan cupcakes i've had. i got the strawberry vanilla , maybe i ll go back and try another flavor ."}, {"review_id": "sho4Lfr6oLL1GmGoVUFLzQ", "user_id": "AMrhEi4bLvaAcC2XggeBsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Cool little bakery for fresh and quality baked goods. My favorite are the doughnuts here which are massive, dense and sweet. I had the s'mores, classic glazed and maple bacon. These doughnuts are more on the heavy and dense side rather than a fluffy and light yeast-raised doughnut. I usually get my doughnuts to go because the space is small and fill ups quick."}, {"review_id": "3Nvjqj1hzEQKQ2XhVwi87A", "user_id": "4UR9kKLO52esl53wKevsjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "I'm not even going to review this place. I'll let my daughter's words speak for me on this one: She barges into my room and says \"I just want you to know that was the greatest cupcake I've ever had. It has redefined what is possible for a cupcake for me. Like *makes explosion noise*\" (end scene)I mean my caramel latte and my son's coconut ice cream cone were pretty good too, but anything that's this life changing to an 18 yr old deserves all the stars.

Even when their selections are low, I always find something I like. This is a great location for vegans due to their entirely vegan menu. Even if you aren't vegan, like myself, I promise the menu items rival any non-vegan alternatives in Jacksonville. They have a large selection of pastries, donuts, cupcakes, and ice cream. They also serve coffee and breakfast biscuits. The dining area is a little cramped, so I often take things to go, which is what my pictures show, but if seats are available, it's nice to take a gander at the art on the wall. You can spot a Mr. Feeny framed in the small cafe. There seriously isn't one thing I wouldn't recommend. My go-to favorites include the salted caramel brownie bites, the lemon poppyseed twist, the cinnamon roll (it's humongous), the homer donut (a classic), anything with matcha, and the breakfast biscuit called the \"double down\"."}, {"review_id": "2_JxG6sWc5hoduPzjwKzmw", "user_id": "9IAxSrReymkT9bQfbOgIsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Went into sweet theory's today and was created by a wonder group of ladies.

As someone who has a sweet tooth but also a dairy allergy... this place is the Mecca of all bakeries. It's so rare for me to be able to walk into a place like this and pick ANYTHING I want, as-is, and not have to worry about allergens. I'm a big donut gal, so I always get one or two (or three or four) flavors when I stop in. My favorite this past time was the banana French toast. The portions are huge (see photo for size comparison) and the presentation makes for a great Instagram shot. They don't only have sweets: they have biscuits and coffee and a few other things here and there. One of my favorite things about this bakery is that they have classics that will always be found behind the counter, but they also have a continuously rotating menu as they experiment with new flavors or cater to holidays or seasons. I am secretly glad this place is so far from my house... my wallet and midsection would be much worse for the wear because I'd go constantly."}, {"review_id": "9FgWbAZhizzIuJUOBWm1dQ", "user_id": "QRzrjWkzLVGYNuKooi4UBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Every time I am in town, I come here without fail!!

I am so passionate about Sweet Theory and recommend them to everyone who visits Jacksonville. I've tricked my stubborn parents into eating vegan donuts and they reluctantly admit they were the best they ever had. The ladies that work there are very kind and passionate. My only complaint is that they haven't open up another location closer to me lol. Every time I'm not having a great day, my husband suggests Sweet Theory to make it all better.

We thought we'd be first since we got there really close to opening. Little did we know the place was already packed and a line out the door.

On top of that, a lot of their baked goods are gluten-free, though you wouldn't know it, and all of their treats are vegan.If you think that gluten-free or vegan baked goods would not taste good, you must not have been to Sweet theory before.

My daughter got the ice cream and she loved it also! There's something for everyone. I was going to order a cake for my birthday next week but they're actually all booked with making Wedding cakes so I'll get a few doughnuts and make a cake out of them!
