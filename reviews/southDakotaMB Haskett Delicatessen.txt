Everything from the graffiti walls to the service was outstanding. Our waitress, Tuesday, offered suggestions to us and we were not disappointed. I had the breakfast sandwich and my fiancée had the quiche of the day. Great prices, great service, great food, great ambiance. We will def be visiting this place again when we are in Sioux Falls."}, {"review_id": "BMVD9ahWUUa-0iL6VEQyiw", "user_id": "FWsglz1WrAmcsWT05wv49Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "This is my favorite place in Sioux Falls. I have always been very impressed with everything I've ever had to eat/drink has been amazing. I go for the quiche, savory crepe, or the daily special.

If nothing else the atmosphere is great! I got the quiche of the day which was delicious but on my second and third stops got the salad and soup of the day. They're pre-made, but still taste so fresh.

We came in at 130 on New Year's Eve & got a table immediately. Our server was friendly & the food & coffee were outstanding.

Lots of time spent in Sioux Falls. Walked into MB Haskett three times. First time, I had missed lunch, and wasn't quite ready for the Friday night 3-course prix fixe dinner, but I came back for Saturday. 1st course, one crunchy crab ball (you might call it a crabcake, but as it was spherical, I deemed it a ball) with a flavorful dipping sauce and a simple yet complete little slaw of beansprouts and pickles. 2nd: a hoisin-marinated grilled chicken breast atop a bed of udon in a light lemongrass broth. I'm not generally a fan of chicken breast (I vastly prefer dark meat), but this one was flavorful and tender; I surprised myself by eating the entire thing with great pleasure. 3rd: a perfect rice pudding with tropical fruits and pistachios. I can't recall ever having a better one.I went back on Monday looking for something I could take out, since I wasn't hungry yet but wanted to have a better option than what I was likely to find at the airport or on the plane. I had just missed the rice bowl, but the quinoa/asparagus/feta salad was a fine consolation prize! I wish I'd also had a chance to try their coffee, but alas, it was not to be. Another time!"}, {"review_id": "4s6nIZbASNPcHUUGYAhMDg", "user_id": "efX8iGtgdPTK7C7_6MUI3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "Brunch is always super wonderful.

I love the fact that I can plop down, order anything on the menu and feel at home. The Bison Tavern is the adult equivalent of a gourmet Sloppy Joe. (the pickles, oh the pickles!) The muffuletta sandwich is my go-to. That sandwich is a duet of Breadico's unctuousness and Haskett's mastery of tapenade and cured meats, coming together for greatness in your mouth-hole. Again, seasonality brings in tasty salads like the German Potato, which has beautiful little gherkins and punchy bits of celery that add the texture and brightness to a surprisingly refreshing interpretation of the German classic (although, I would love to see some bacon added because: Bacon). Breakfast, coffee, salads - it's all fabulous and the service, again - feels like home."}, {"review_id": "AB6qvRIQ4-A_Pjv9NIr-DA", "user_id": "lslHQh8-FPMFX0iI9lkvNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "One of our favorite spots to go for breakfast in downtown Sioux Falls.

Oatmeal was average good. Service was very welcoming and friendly, but lacked efficiency. During our experience, seemed our server made several trips over with one thing at a time, and we had to ask separately for things like silverware, cream, napkins, etc. Cute environment with cozy seating area - very close to neighboring tables. We loved our spot right in the big front bay window area, people watching on the sidewalk."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mb-haskett-delicatessen-sioux-falls?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
