Walla burgers does a really good job at what they do! From the moment you walk into the store, you are treated  as a part of the family. I could tell that they were really excited about what they do. I had the pleasure of been great but Kai. He was very friendly and excited to tell me about what they had to offer. He made recommendations and was not pushy at all. This for me is a great part of customer service which many establishment lack. On to the food. I got the walla lamb burger which was amazing!!! The patty to bun ratio was perfect and the patty was seasoned perfectly. You could tell that it was a great quality of meaat. I also had the mango tamarind wings and the walla wings which were just perfect. They were perfectly fried hard like I asked and perfectly saucy at the same time. Lastly, the mango lassi is to die for.... Trust me, get it with the coconut milk. Based on the great customer service and the great food, I know I will be back in the near future. Also, shout out to chef troy who stopped by the table to see if we were enjoying our burgers."}, {"review_id": "aVWVNu2Derw1gasbG4OnTQ", "user_id": "HJriPWpQKpQHG9eCNjT5GA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I unexpectedly stumbled into Walla because we were starving for some goodness and Tops was extremely overcrowded. Upon entering the owner, well what had to be the owner, asked us if with if This was our first time.  YES!!!! We replied!! So now let's get down to it...He prompted us to the starters menu, far left. We went with the double beef Walla Burger, single lamb burger, sweet potato tots, and chili mango wings!!!First off! Be prepared to pay more than the two $ money value shown. It's not cheap but I would definitely say it's closer to the more expensive side for a burger spot. Something comparable to Shake Shack but well worth it! Service is great and now let's talk about the food...Double beef burger 5 stars! Juicy, super fresh meat, perfectly complimenting toppings and NO KETCHUP NEEDED!Now you know a burger is good if you don't need ketchup !Lamb burger! Super juicy, super fresh meat! Comes with goat which I loveeeeeeeee. It created this honey taste that compliments the lamb and makes it so easy to eat! I almost bit but my finger!Sweet potato tots! I wouldn't get it again although they were good. They are pretty small but satisfying. Chili mango wings!! TO DIE FOR. Do they bake it? Do they  boil it then bake it ? I DONT KNOW JUST GET IT!!! They are so good and tender. God I want more nowwwwI'll def be back!!"}, {"review_id": "yw6NhUcotsaFt_SnKFPfkg", "user_id": "nrVlQQpOOs1BG1yNFHyjIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "Vegan and in love with Burger Walla. I go to grad school down the street and I usually always get Green Chicpea before my night classes. However, one day Green Chicpea was closed & I decided to be adventurous.... Got me some samosas and fries (junk food vegans, they got u covered) and it was amazing. Went back an additional time even though Green Chicpea WAS open, simply because I was craving those samosas. Truly incredible, the batter is so delightfully crispy and the filling is an awesome contrast.Looking forward to trying the veggie burger, but unfortunately I love the samosas so much that I've yet to get anything else!!"}, {"review_id": "0T4_IPgrj6-XsPo4kfDl2w", "user_id": "YuDHCOh1M-tysWdVEKCTkQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I guess we'll never know how good.

That made me really really sad, because although it was quite a yummy burger - it is not worth $14. I don't believe all these secret spices were really in my burger patty to make the price difference that acceptable. The fries which were $3-4 were okay, crunchy but super greasy from being over-fried, although the spicy ketchup, spicy mustard and spicy mayo mixtures were quite nice for dipping.It is great that I tried this place once but I don't need to come back since my order came out to $18 and I believe for that price, this fast food place definitely did not live up to the hype. I would be just as happy at five guys or burgerfi or shake shack honestly!So next time they charge that much they better deliver on flavor, quantity, service, and decor. This is clearly supposed to be a college burger place - with wall street burger prices? Its nuts!"}, {"review_id": "GGmCcqU9EsdTQ_HduDCjtQ", "user_id": "YwNLEnHC43zD6wSY2d-_rg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "Boom! Burger Walla delivers delicious, juicy burgers with Indian flair. What a beautiful concept! I got a regular Walla Lamb Burger while my hubs got a double. YUM! Their burgers kinda look like Smashburger's, but don't let their craggy-edged patties deceive you. Their regular size (single patty) was damn filling and tasty af with goat cheese, Walla sauce (smoky honey-roasted mustard), and standards like pickles, tomatoes, and caramelized onions on a supportive, non-interfering potato bun. Their double was too much for me but left my hubs more than satisfied.Their Fries are an okay mix of soggy and crisp, but oh, those Sweet Potato Tots- soft with slight bite on the inside, super crunchy goodness on the outside. Get this, please!!! Then their Mango Lassi with coconut milk and Banana Lassi with whole milk were thick and yummy!This place is walkable from NJIT and Rutgers Newark. The internet was kinda spotty inside, but I just accepted it and enjoyed my meal. My order of a regular and a double Walla Lamb Burger, 2 Lassi drinks, 2 Sweet Potato Tots, and 1 Fries came to under $40.

I got the Walla beef and sweet potato tots. Definitely over priced, I asked for no onions or pickles, and no Walla sauce yet got all of those but they did remember to add bacon. Walla sauce is a bit spicy which is fine but I don't eat spicy food, after I took out onions and pickles the over all burger was good but not anything special for that price. Also if your planning on ordering for pick up keep in mind they need advanced payment for orders above $20! I was so excited to try the sweet potato tots and was very disappointed- tots were practically raw, soft not crunchy outside . I wouldn't recommend what I tried. There maybe other stuff that maybe good but for me first impressions are key."}, {"review_id": "tyPb66MRANwNhhk7arYMcQ", "user_id": "CNV8AxZUSyNu8BdCJ8_HMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "SWEET POTATO TOTS are a MUST.

( btw that's how they answer the phone when you call). It's rare I give out 5 stars so when I do it means they've earned it fair and square.Burger Walla is my go to spot anytime I'm downtown. At lot of people at my school don't even know they exist and I'm glad to put them on.  They have the most freshest fast food. Their french fries are hand cut everyday by them. The fries even cold are still great tasting. This is def a hidden gem in Newark , I came to school with food from here and everybody in the cafe was asking me where I got my food from and confirmed that they had never heard of burger walla. The owners are super cool too. I haven't had the chance to eat in I always take my food to go but the decor is super chill laid back and cozy.

It's been on my list for a while, I finally got to try it for lunch takeout. - Food: I had high expectations for Burger Walla, mainly because of its cool and unique concept. I ended up ordering the Walla Veggie (Walla Sauce, Dill Pickle, Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Caramelized Onions) ($6) with sides of Sweet Potato Tots(Crunchy crust with sweet pillowy inside) ($3) and the Cauliflower & Chickpeas (Oven Roasted with Onions & Spices, Pan Fired to Order)($4). Generally, I was disappointed by the lack of spice and seasoning as I originally expected, especially with the two sides. The exception was the burger, which was well spiced, seasoned and tasty, but overall nothing special. The Sweet Potato Tots are an unique item, but honestly didn't really enjoy them as much as I thought - they seemed a bit soggy and bland. The Cauliflower & Chickpeas was also disappointingly bland, and I had to mix in spicy mayo to have some flavor. - Service: I placed an order for pickup and it was ready within 10 minutes. The staff at the counter were generally nice and friendly. Overall, unfortunately Masala Walla didn't live up to my expectations, but still a creative cuisine. I probably won't be going back here -- wasn't bad, just nothing special or endearing."}, {"review_id": "tc0tDK8n-T4s79EIAEN7RA", "user_id": "68Iu2Wphu0YU1RbJLKjUaA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Reviewed this place before. Come back periodically for a change. A good selection of burgers to include veggie, chicken, and shrimp. Hot dogs are Bests (local brand) and are very good. I get more be with no onions as the onions tend to be sweet. Believe it or not the Samoans are pretty good! From a burger place no less! My reason for the 3 stars is the wait, and wait, and wait. It is definitely worth it, but coming in and figuring out where the line to order starts, and where the line to wait on your order ends is confusing. One person runs the grill with another on fried items and prep. Two more are on the register. And still we wait. It's fresh for sure, but when you're pressed for time the wait can be frustrating"}, {"review_id": "05W2ep2nYNwjkEwXIGp4Ow", "user_id": "qLBuM-I6GDeVCl_roHy6LQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Burgers are great here.

The main reason it's losing two stars from me is because I felt that the employees were rather rude/curt for no specific reason. I came in way before the lunch rush and didn't particularly make any unrealistic requests.BUT ANYWHO.... It's your typical Smashburger-type establishment that goes for a higher level of quality than McDonald's or Burger King. I had the Walla Chicken without the caramelized onions, and it was very good chicken burger. The ground chicken was infused with cilantro which helped to combat the overall plainness/dryness of that ground chicken typically has. I found the \"walla sauce\" that comes with the sandwich to be a little bit bland; it was mostly just sweet with very little other flavor. Next time I think I would substitute it with one of the other sauces. I got some spicy ketchup from the sauce bar and it definitely had a bit of a kick to it so I added that to my burger as well.I really wanted to try the fries and desserts but I was really trying to be a little healthier today. Maybe next time! I'm still not really sure what makes this place fit into the category of \"Indian\" other than the options of lassi and parathas on the menu but I guess I will have to find out. I was hoping the walla sauce would've been that distinguishing factor but I personally don't believe it was."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/burger-walla-newark?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
