City Pork's an inspiration. They held a table for us late and then completely flexed when a large portion of our party bailed, before proceeding to graciously nourish us. Having eaten there before, we've enjoyed the pork alchemy and inspired cocktails, but were reminded this visit what else they offer that sets them apart - natural charm, both in their staff and in their fantabuous playlist. What did we consume? Uh, what didn't we consume? Standouts include Smoked Duck & Gouda, Red Dot Shrimp, Boudin Balls, Tomahawk Pork Chop, Shrimp & Boudin, The Big Pig (tenderest pulled pork we Texans can remember), and a Cubano to convert an unbeliever. And then there were Mustard Greens - an enchantment not to be forgotten. More than relaxed and unpretentious, City Pork's imaginative reinvention of the pig extends to every element of their establishment. Any trip to Baton Rouge would be made memorable with a time at their table. Fly, fly friends!"}, {"review_id": "x3RKjIjXktgiDeB9klnPMA", "user_id": "wkeHanFMXAX3eRT5li-YGA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I pass this place often when I am going to and forth from work. So I decided to stop in and try it. There is a door that says \"pick up/to go\" so I entered this door. There was a young lady standing behind the counter near that entrance. She was graying cheese. I asked could I place an order. She looked as if she was caught off guard. I replied \"if you can't it's ok\" she took her gloves off and walked around to me. I gave her her order and another waitress passed and she asked her to take my order so I had to repeat myself to the other waitress who seemed less enthused to take my orderI felt out of place there all together but I decided to stay and just get my lunch. I sat there and patiently waited. I ordered a sandwich to go with extra mayo. They have me mayonnaise with no utensils to spread it I had to go back in the restaurant for utensils. I didn't even get napkins. Over all this was not a good experience for a first visit and I'm not sure I'll return"}, {"review_id": "EP8g3azut0rio54dXs7CZw", "user_id": "vakq_rhyuxEc4WNndCT0AA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Our reserved table was a little slow leaving so we had a cocktail at the bar while waiting. Excellent craft cocktails, especially the Sazerac and the High Life (no relation to beer). We ordered from the seasonal menu, redfish and Cajun bouillabaisse. Started with a basic salad, which was quite well done with a light dressing and gorgonzola. Some cruchy bits in there, not sure what they were, but very tasty. Also some lardons that were pure Louisiana. Hubs had the gazpacho salad with seafood and it was really amazing. Lots of shrimp and very acidic. I have no idea why they call it gazpacho because it has nothing in common with real gazpacho but it is a delightful dish. The bouillabaisse was a much lighter take on the traditional, with the addition of vegetables, but is very fresh. We did find a tiny bit of shell :( The seasonal redfish with spinach was outstanding. There was a touch of crunch on the edges of the fish contrasting with the tender interior, a touch of heat in the drops of hot sauce littering the plate, and perfectly cooked, very fresh tasting fish. The spinach was a nice addition to the redfish but I think personally I would prefer it cooked lightly rather than southern greens style. Speaking of greens, we got a southern greens side dish and it was terrific with a little heat and porky goodness. Note it is a loud place. There was a family with small children attempting to enjoy their meal while we dined and I sympathize with they but this is a poor choice if you have kids. I thought this was a terrific place. Only one suggestion for management: offer a lighter dessert option. A nice house made sorbet would have been perfect. That said, we were gifted with a surprise bread pudding and it was fabulous, without doubt. Not too sweet, complex, relatively light. In summary, it's a terrific meal in a charming facility with great service. I eat in big cities regularly and this Baton Rouge gem could hold its own in Houston, Dallas, or Austin any day."}, {"review_id": "Y4E5HI9v5b0WYCBgNhGakA", "user_id": "p3WgkX2d-4ZhF0NHULXo6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Went here for a ladies' brunch and it was perfect!

(2 pieces)The city wedge salad was fresh. Second courseWhile the wild boar sauce piquant was delicious it wasn't amazing. I would describe it as jambalaya in a midly spicy tomato sauce.The hangar steak was very juicy, tender, flavorful, and not too chewy. A must try!Third courseI was really disappointed that the molten caramel cake was very underwhelming because it looked so beautiful! It simply tasted like a chocolate cake. It was also extremely rich. However the bacon bread pudding was absolutely delightful. Don't be afraid of the word bacon in it! City pork is definitely a must try for restaurant week! I've had yet another wonderful experience here and they did not disappoint.

So much so that it's almost trying too hard to emulate others in the genre and does not feel very original to me. That being said, I understand that there aren't many places like this in Baton Rouge so, to some degree, it may be seen as more original within the area than I'd consider it to be and I don't see anything wrong with that.As for food, their Shrimp and Boudin dish was vastly over priced at $26. I mean, they offer a side order of boudin for $4. With this in mind, that means they are basically charging $22 more to add five shrimp, some herbs, and fried onions to the boudin to get this entree. Not at all worth it in my opinion. Plus I picked up some boudin balls on our way to Baton Rouge that were $0.75 each and were ten times better than what we had here.Their cocktails are solid. I had their Bacon Old Fashioned and it was much better than I thought it would be, especially considering it comes with a bunch of ice. The stick of City Pork bacon definitely helped. I also tasted their Southern Hemisphere (Vodka, Basil, Strawberries, Lemon, and Sparkling Wine) and it was good too. The absolute star of the show however is their Pecan Bread Pudding with Bacon Praline Ice Cream. It is ridiculously good!!! I'm someone who feels for every 10 bread puddings you come by, maybe 1 will be memorable. This one, when combined with that heavenly ice cream may make you forget that any other bread puddings ever existed, it's that damn good. It's also the reason why this is a 3 star review and not 2. If I were just reviewing the bread pudding, we're talking 5 stars all the way.Our server was really nice which is always a plus and there's no question I would come back for the bread pudding in a heart beat, and maybe to try some appetizers. That's about it though."}, {"review_id": "mFw1FSt28em1Pz5F08w8fQ", "user_id": "QQtoHnP0cP7nzNnUob_1CQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "I rarely really give 5 stars and even less will I give it out if I've only eaten somewhere once.

The Brassiere and Bar location was a recommendation of a Yelp friend. It certainly does not disappoint me. I like the young look decorations in the restaurant. It design for young people to spent a night dinning experience. If you love pork, this is an amazing gastronomic place. We start with a Red Dot Shrimp. It come four giant shrimp over the chipotle red sauce with bacon bit inside. The sauce is amazing with a kick in the tongue. The bacon certainly make the sauce sophisticate. The shrimp is coat with a layer of crispy batter.My entrÃ©e is the Chicken Fried Duck and my friend have a Cajun Smoke Brisket. The duck is coated with a layer of Cajun spice flour and deep fried to crispy. Is certainly is a home made coating. The duck may be has been process precook or broil to soften and tenderize the meat. It is folk cut tenderize. It serve over the apricot sauce with the broccolini and mash potatoes. The brisket is smoke to the best cook meat with preserve the moisture of each beef line of meat. Love the sauce that over it. Overall the the service is excellent.

I really want to give this place 5 stars. We've ordered from here several times. My SO loves their Cajun Smoked Brisket sandwich. I love the Blue Cheese Bibb. I've gotten the Smoked Chicken Club sandwich, which is also good. We've also tried the pork debris spring rolls, which while very delicious, fell apart while trying to pick them up. But that could be because they were in a to-go box for some time and the steam made them a little soggy. We've also tried the house fries, Mac n' cheese, and greens, all good.My problem really comes with our experience Sunday when trying their brunch menu. I called to place the order: French Toast, Steak (medium well) and eggs, the usual, cheese grits, and house fries (omg I love their fries). I had never talked to the man taking the order before. I had to repeat myself several times. Surprise surprise, when I went to pick up the food at the bar, he'd left off the French toast. I didn't mind waiting for them to make some. We really wanted to try them. I asked for the berry coulis to be on the side as I'd asked on the phone, and the woman at the bar said that is normal (leaving it off) for to-go orders. French toast arrives, I take my bag of goodies, and I head out to my car. I happened to glance at the item on top (French toast), and to my surprise, the berry coulis was poured all over them! I checked the other food, and sure enough, another item was wrong. So, I go back into the restaurant and ask about it. The woman at the bar apologizes and takes the two incorrect items from me. I asked if there was some way to keep the rest of the food warm while I waited. She pointed to someone behind me and told me her manager would be out to talk to me in a second.She eventually came from behind the bar, took the bag from me, and gave it to her manager, which confused me, but hey, as long as the problem is getting fixed. The manager apologized, let me know the person taking orders was new, and took my food to stay warm while I waited. He also comped the meal, which was completely unnecessary and kind of him. Time passes, I get my bag of goodies again, go home, ready to chow do. My SO takes a bite out of his steak, closes it and starts eating the French toast. So, I looked at his steak, that was supposed to be medium well (picture attached), and then I was just done.Now this is the part that's most important: This place, to me, is worthy of five stars. My problem is that three times, they got the order wrong- the initial write up of the order, the berry coulis which they said they don't even put on to-go orders of French toast, and the steak's doneness. It just ruined the experience for us."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-pork-brasserie-and-bar-baton-rouge?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
