The food is insanely good- you HAVE to get the Poutine and fried chicken-those two are staples! If you have the awesome-ness to inhale more food after those mammoths, I would recommend their donuts, Holy-bourbon those things are addictive!  overall, a great spot for consistently great food and laid back chill vibe!"}, {"review_id": "940sq2ZyjemWBpVaZKDaPw", "user_id": "S3nlJPj53-0SLjoAwler_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/17/2017", "text": "ButaPub: a dive bar with an Asian fusion menu. Weird, right? But in a good way.I was in town for work and looking for something more local than touristy after spending a day on planes and in airports. ButaPub came up on Yelp and I checked out the menu. The Asian fusion appealed to me, especially the Korean Fried Chicken.The location was a little hard to spot given it's in the basement of a building and there's apparently a dance studio attached to the back (I saw people dancing, so I assume...?). They do have a parking lot, which is pretty terrible. It's all one-ways with no exits, so you have to back down the aisles... Very weird design.Anyway, I managed to get inside and was surprised that I was standing in what can only be described as a dive bar/lounge. There's couches and a pool table and a surprising amount of empty space. There are some tables, but I'm not sure how many. It definitely seems more like it was designed for the late-night crowd than a place to sit and eat, but I took a spot at the bar regardless.The bar was populated by locals--I appeared to be the only traveler there. Good signs, good signs. I quickly ordered the Korean Fried Chicken and a local hard cider (1911, which I continued to drink for my entire time in Rochester because it's tasty). The chicken took a while to come, but it was half a bird being fried so I understood. When it came out, I had an entire tray of chicken, mac and cheese, kimchi, and pickles.The kimchi was definitely old, but not too bad. The chicken was delicious! It wasn't at all spicy (I'm assuming they tempered the gochujang with sugar or something.), but it was juicy and delicious. It wasn't what I would call Korean fried, but I don't expect to get real Korean fried chicken outside of South Korea (and maybe a Koreatown somewhere), so I wasn't bothered. Indeed, it was just good fried chicken with a tasty sauce.The bartender was new, but did well--owning up to what she didn't know and finding out the answers. Good bartender! The locals were a hoot, too. Thanks to everyone for all the food recommendations!All in all, if I lived here I would make it a point to stop in and try more from their menu. If my meal was any indication, they know how to do good Asian fusion."}, {"review_id": "3vWu3Kr5GlO5j0idRqKaTg", "user_id": "-ywI3rE2CGE2cdrPEhNLCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "ButaPub is an American pub with menu inspiration from Asia, a community gathering place for anyone who likes good food, good drink and a casual atmosphere. Located in the Historic German House in Rochester's vibrant South Wedge neighborhood, ButaPub features a menu drawing influence from across Asia and comfortable favorites for any palette. Items like ramen noodles, house-made steam buns and banh mi sandwiches share menu space with familiar burgers, wings and other pub favorites. Their menu uses and showcases the best of the region's locally-produced ingredients.To help make ButaPub even more attractive, General Manager and Events Coordinator Evan Pierce keeps things active. A variety of bands play throughout the week, everything from jazz or bluegrass to hip-hop, and Pierce asserts that ButaPub hosts the largest local gathering of Geeks Who Drink, a pub quiz game. The drink menu is robust, with 20-plus bourbons, more than 15 rye and Irish whiskeys, and an assortment of vodkas and gins, in addition to beer, wine, and ciders. Drink specials change with the season.My wife and I stopped at ButaPub while in Rochester over the weekend for a day trip and tried out their brunch.  The inside is very nicely, modernly decorated.  Nice colors, wood floors, nice bar in the front.  We were sat right away and given our menus.  Now, my only issue with the place was our server.  He took forever to initially come over to us, even though there was only one other table sat, didn't introduce himself, had to be asked 3 times to bring straws over, and just had a generally uninterested attitude.  But, other than that, the rest of the experience was great.My wife ordered some pulled pork pancakes with a side of home fries, while I went for the Korean style half chicken and donuts entree.  The kitchen starts each piece with a long soak in a brine heavy with aromatics. The chicken is then tossed with cornstarch and allowed to dry, then takes a second dip into a tempura-like batter made with flour and cornstarch.  In the fryer, the chicken's coating browns, and gets crispy and craggy. To keep that lovely crust intact, a soy-garlic sauce is brushed on.The donuts are fresh made, hot, and dipped in a bourbon infused glaze.  The dish is also served with house made bread & butter pickles, which I'm usually not a fan of, but I figured I'd try them since they're house made.  The chicken was awesome.  Crispy, juicy, the sauce was spicy but sweet.  The donuts were also amazing  - hot, fresh, sweet, delicious glaze.  I didn't enjoy the pickles alone, but I had a couple with bites of the chicken and it paired well.  My wife also very much liked her dishes, especially her home fries, which she said were perfectly seasoned and crispy.We would definitely go back if we were in the area!"}, {"review_id": "JSrKveCRJheAvZvEI0VB4g", "user_id": "B_-ZN03P7XW-U4_H2X_mXw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm updating my review because I finally dined in at the restaurant today (previously had just been delivery orders) and I really liked the vibe. We went on a Tuesday night for dinner so it was not busy at all. The service was a little slow, but the food was so good that it mostly made up for it. Our server as very friendly and attentive, it just seemed like the kitchen was moving a little slower than expected for a night that wasn't busy. Aside from that, I really liked the interior of this place. The seating is spacious, with booths and tables and couches here and there, too, which I'm sure are great for nights when they have live entertainment. The bar area looked well stocked and cozy, although we didn't sit up there.

Obviously they don't expect a large lunch crowd.There was one other server on duty.The two servers were a competent team today as there were only a few guests.My only complaint will be that our order of wings to share arrived after our entrees.A little strange but not earth shattering.Our server was new but capable and accommodating.My guess is this is a fun place at night.There are some large music speakers and amps in the middle of the dining room.Seating was a mix of booths and tables spaced nicely around the room.Food and beverage prices all seem to be in accordance with this trendy type of social/casual hip joint ambiance of today.Give it a try if you are open minded."}, {"review_id": "Kruk7j__uETRAudP9tUEAw", "user_id": "Ba9PhDcNT0gCvsn64HnBuw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "Decided to try this joint since we were in the neighborhood.

Butapub is an interesting place. We first ordered take-out from here but the food was completely bland. However, we decided to go in person before we fully judged the place. We ordered the Korean wings in gochujang sauce, the fries, and the doughnuts (which are not on the menu, but you should try ask for anyway) and the food was much better. We won't say the food was amazing, but the food here is miles better than most other bar foods. And the aforementioned doughnuts are some of the best we've had when paired with the chicken--as strange as that sounds. The only downside is that the place is too loud. However, you can't knock that against them, it IS a pub. I'd gladly recommend this place for eating (not take-out) any day. Just make sure to get the doughnuts! Also, I hear that you can even order a pig head here (these may just be rumors though)."}, {"review_id": "Nl79CIbuOOh6G9USDjz7EA", "user_id": "TwzkN3bmARqxeEFWDv2vsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "This place is absolutely amazing!

Best Asian Fusion place I've definitely been to so far, they got that fusion on fleek. We were there for my friend's 22nd birthday and it was definitely the perfect setting.We started with the Oyako Poutine, Bing Bread, and a Japanese seafood flatbread. Then my birthday girl ordered their Korean fried chicken ($19) that is a half chicken with mac n cheese and kimchi, and I ordered the Bulgogi rice bowl ($19). Another friend ordered the fish n chips which came with beer battered cod with potatoes and smashed peas which you could substitute with brussel sprouts (def recommend doing). Everything was INCREDIBLE. The food is pretty pricey but the portions are so big we should have just split entrees between two people. The waitress was super nice and helpful, and made sure our drinks were filled. We got some tasty beers that were decently cheap too. Will definitely be coming back to try brunch.

The main reason for such a low rating is because of the service. The first time I was here, it was new years day and during lunch time. My bf and I walked in, waited awkwardly at the hostess stand and after a good 5 minutes was finally greeted by the bartender who had seen us come in and was told to sit anywhere we wanted to. We waited another 15 minutes at our table when I got up and asked the bartender at the bar if there was any waistaff coming. I was informed that he is the only one working that afternoon. What?! A restaurant with a full bar and dining room and one person working?! We finally got a menu after a few minutes and the bartender/waiter was pretty nice at least. My bf and I both got the butapub ramen and korean fried chicken with sweet sambal sauce. We are pretty glad we waited. The korean fried chicken was delicious!! It totally saved the day or I'd have given this place 1 star. The chicken wings are huge! The batter is crispy and the sauce is so flavorful. It's so good we ordered it both times. The ramen is rich but the flavor is a bit odd....it seems to be some sort of seafood broth?? The pork is not as tender as it should be. Not my favorite ramen in Rochester, not that I've found a place with ramen I would order again. The second time we were here, we also had to wait awkwardly at the hostess stand as several waittresses passed us, looked at us, and kept walking without even a \"we'll be right with you\". Not cool...at all. This time there was a country singer performing and the place was busy. We finally got seated and ordered the pork belly banh mi, poutine and of course the korean chicken. My bf also had one of their drinks, way too strong for me so I can't comment. After taking our order our server dissappeared until after our meal....we had to flag down a random waittress to get us more napkins, which were forgotten and we had to ask yet another person for more napkins. Anyways, the food the second time around was a little dissapointing. The poutine is rich but way salty. My bf loves poutine and he said it was good so if you're a poutine fan you should give butapub's version a shot. The banh mi was bland. There was no flavor in the pork. All I tasted with every bite was the pickled veggies. The chips it came with was alright at least. The korean chicken was smaller this time around but still yummies. I would come back to get more korean chicken and try something else but they need to improve their service."}, {"review_id": "Rrh-5sLyicd3gqKO743AWw", "user_id": "JCbP3jpvEbXen1OWE8xEzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Great location and friendly service.

Attire: you should wear your hippest hipster-wear here (jeans and a solid t-shirt would work perfectly). I felt super lame in my button-down shirt and shorts. Next time, I will remember to try and look younger. Also beards are in right now, in case you need to start early. Service: Our server had a great sense of humor, and she had described her favorite dishes so well that I pretty much ordered whatever she told me. When I picked something that they were out of (an entrée and a beer), she let me down gently. She kept our drinks refilled and didn't rush us at all as dining service was concluding. Food: THIS IS WHERE BUTAPUB EXCELS AT EVERYTHING! The Asian Fusion menu is inspired and delicious. Our party of four started with the Pork Belly Steam Buns and the Korean Style Chicken Wings, which made for a perfect culinary introduction to Butapub. For dinner, my Bulgogi Rice Bowl (recommended by our waitress) was to die for. As I reminiscence about this dish, I can't help but wish that I could somehow make up a lie to tell my wife that would bring me back there to indulge myself in another bowl. Somehow, we thought dessert would be a good idea. We ordered three,of which I remember that our two favorites were the bourbon-glazed donuts and the bana sundae were decadent and sweet.After all of the food and drinks, why is this a four? One word: decor. While the bar area itself looks great, the dining room and the oddly-carpeted pool room with another bar and a dartboard and TV felt disjointed. The chairs and tables and cutlery felt way cheaper than the overall quality of the food. It wasn't that we were uncomfortable as much as it was noticeable. The swing dance class going on above us in the German House added a lot of odd stomping noises above us as we ate. Towards the end of the meal, they were clearing out tables for a DJ to set up his turntables, and it made us stop and wonder whether this was a restaurant or a night club. Again, I wouldn't know, because I am from the suburbs. Aside from our confusion, all four of us concluded that we'll be back again for more of that glorious food in the future."}, {"review_id": "04MInyq1e4-0fydq7ww0lw", "user_id": "c7W5tKBoeu6Hm13w-cK1sQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/12/2017", "text": "We just went to ButaPub for the first time and absolutely loved it!It was a friend's birthday and we met for happy hour on a Friday.

It was just a little sweet for my taste.We also ordered the Short Rib Dumplings and they were divine. The goat cheese fondue offers just the right amount of brightness to complement the decadence of the dumplings. The onions, radish, and scallions on top added a freshness to make the dish a harmonious blend of textures and flavors.A friend ordered the wings and we tried those as well.

We went around 4:30, because I want to be like an old person and eat early and avoid the crowd. Apparently we weren't the only parents with that same idea, because the only other two tables we saw had babies with them, and butapub is equipped with high chairs, who would have thought? Anyway, given the time of day, service was good, atmosphere was enjoyable. I personally was pumped for shishito peppers, \"roulette peppers\" as our server described them, as I had read about them but hadn't seen them anywhere. They were delicious, and I imagine that the 1/10 odds of an extremely hot pepper would be a fun drinking game. Pork buns weren't very fluffy, but they weren't the prepackaged kind I see everywhere else so I give them a free pass. We ordered both standbys mentioned in other reviews, the poutine and the Korean fried chicken. Both were delicious. The skin on the chicken was light and crisp. It really makes me happy to get all the spiciness of gochujang AND macaroni and cheese in one entree. The spiciness of kimchi AND French fries. I love this particular style of fusion, it hits all my personal happy notes.
