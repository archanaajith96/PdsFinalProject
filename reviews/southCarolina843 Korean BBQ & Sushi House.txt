I told my husband I wanted sushi but not just any sushi place.  I wanted a bar to sit at and experience the sushi chef-client relationship.  Alex did NOT disappoint at all.  He made us feel welcomed from the moment we sat at the bar until the moment we stepped away from it.  The conversation never faltered and we learned so much from him about the fish and the preparation and his education and knowledge.  From the Scorpian Roll he expertly prepared for Jeremy to my Rice bowl with the trio of Salmon, Tuna and Whitefish over rice the experience was amazing.  I think his chilled Cucumber and Lemon Grass infused Saki cemented my love affair with his culinary talents.  To round out our meal we were presented with a bite sized taste of the smoked salmon rolled around a dab of cream cheese and cucumber sticks.  The treat was packed full of fresh Smokey salmon flavor and the perfect crunch of crisp cucumber.  I could just eat a tray full of these.  For dessert I had the Raspberry Pavlova.  It melted so sweetly on my tongue.  The perfect palate cleanser completing a wonderful culinary experience.  Make it a priority to sit down at Alex's sushi bar and let him dazzle you with his witty and entertaining conversation complimented by the talents of an experienced sushi chef to create a dinning experience you will think about for months and years to come.  This is what dinning is all about.This may be my \"Cheers\""}, {"review_id": "Q6-398d_9WWfZ1oHvrzwrw", "user_id": "mmpaiY1cm9bvt3cWYI4pQw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "This is one of the first restaurants my family and I tried when we moved here a year ago.  Place is clean and big.  Low lights and a full bar. They have a la carts here as well as the all you can eat (AYCE) menu for Korean BBQ.  For this place being the only option for Korean BBQ in this whole city, it's OK.  In my opinion, it's over priced for a limited selection of meats etc.  Where I come from (California) for 22 dollars a person, it's all you can eat and you can order any meat off the menu.  The sides are authentic and well worth the money but here, it's pretty limited. I do hope more Korean BBQ's will open up and provide a little competition.  Better pricing and selections would be good but it may be years before the restaurant industry here catches up to the west coast. We will def return considering this is our only option in town."}, {"review_id": "t2_Fa5y5QlK-cxclHMHfXA", "user_id": "P98uzBVO8gF_DO4VJr5kqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "One side is Korean bbq..where if I understand correctly..you pick your items and cook it on a grill table along with others..I chose the traditional dining side and ordering off a menu and having the food brought to me..The rice bowl with curry vegetables was delicious..for $3 extra you can add meat..I chose chickenI hear the peach Sogu drink is wonderful...in Japanese restaurants it would be known as cold sake...Unfortunately, I'm now on heart meds so cannot drink any alcohol ...waahI topped off my meal with red bean mochi ice cream..yumOur waiter was pleasant..I think I will come back again for sushi..the menu is similar to that of Japanese restaurants..average pricescheck it out!"}, {"review_id": "Tne3rsEuGfZGIjIvd3hNtg", "user_id": "ptGOjQFFBBUijBoIBpEayg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm gonna update my review since I've been to this place three times since my last \"okay\" review. My boyfriend and I love to come here for the bulgogi. I've wanted to venture out and try other things but I just can't give it up! The service was fantastic every time since my last review. They have a dish that my boyfriend and I LOVE...it comes with the bulgogi and is something like crab salad. I'm not sure but man it's good. We put it with kimchi and chow down on it. Sooo yummy. By the time the bulgogi comes, I'm almost full and have to take it for leftovers after a few bites. But I'm not complaining. It's just as good the second day.We'll keep coming here and enjoying the dishes. Maybe one day one of us will venture out!

No joke. We are big sushi lovers so when we found a spot that had sushi as well as Korean barbecue we were very excited. Their sushi is so amazing. Each roll is HUGE so you really get your money's worth! One time, we sat at the bar and the sushi chef invited us to come back so that he can make us sushi that wasn't on the menu. We really appreciated that kind of customer service. I must say, though, during one of our first visits, we had Korean barbecue there and it wasn't the best. The marinades on the meats were not up to par with what we were used to in the past, but everything else that they have is really good so I do have to come back and give their Korean barbecue another shot. On my most recent visit, I had their bi bim bap and it was DELICIOUS! Like, I-woke-up-knowing-I-was-going-to-have-a-good-day-cause-I-had-leftovers delicious! I usually order bi bim bap from another Korean restaurant in town, but this gave them a run for their money.Overall, 843 is very tasty and one of my favorites in town.(Also, a coworker of mine mentioned how they have ratchet karaoke so you KNOW I have to come back and try that.)"}, {"review_id": "NMOtl6qa0WCWOr6E1WA65w", "user_id": "eUFsFdkFDoGeCc-CfKeUyg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I drove 2hrs to eat at this establishment. So far, I've been here 5x for all you eat bbq, to eat in dinners. The lunch all you eat bbq is great and the best price. Service and the atmosphere is nice. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Sometimes service is slow but due to high demands with the tables with a lot of people you have to be patient. Staff is trying to fulfill your needs for sure.

Luckily, one of my Yelp amigos reminded me of how amazing it was the day before. After a movie in North Charleston, we were looking for a bite to eat and 843 came to mind. It was late, but it was also the weekend so we headed that way. I couldn't wait to try the bulgogi I'd heard so much about.When we arrived, I was disappointed to hear that dinner service stopped at 10PM and it was now 10 after. We almost left because the late night menu was very limited, but figured we weren't going to find much else after 10PM so we made it work. There was no bulgogi on the late night menu but they did have yaki udon... a favorite of mine. We sat at the bar waiting for our food. Throughout the entire meal, everyone in the restaurant was attentive and eager to ensure we were satisfied. After a short wait, my yaki udon literally danced onto the bar in front of me. Covered in bonito flakes, my hot dish came alive right in front of me! The mushrooms were delicious and the sauce light and sweet. While different than most udon dishes I've had, this one stood on its own.After coming in slightly disappointed, I now can't wait to go back. I'm looking forward to eating at the bbq tables and was told they'd be adding a bulgogi burger to the late night menu. Plus, there's a karaoke room in the back room. So many reasons for me to find myself back 843 ASAP. This might be a new favorite!"}, {"review_id": "FW6sWCriUuYLKlzB7G_Wdg", "user_id": "utubOC6HjpgqN6Judy7wzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/2/2017", "text": "Quality. Quality.

A true diamond in the not quite hood. Ive driven past 843 Korean BBQ endless amounts of times and never thought to give it a go for whatever reason, probably because I thought the name was weird, not sure,  but my sister was in town this past weekend craving some sushi and such and thankfully this place popped into mind. We arrived and the host explained the two seating options: the side where you prepare your own meats and veggies and the normal dining room. My family being unfamiliar with Korean BBQ raised eyebrows left and right when presented with the option to prepare their own food at a restaurant sooooo normal dining room it is. WINS:SERVICE: TJ our server was excellent! He was friendly, helpful, patient, and really contributed to the entire dining experience. His presence was fluid and never intrusive or absent. Perfect waiter. FOOD: I absolutely love Korean food, but its not very available here. Its always light, spicy, hot, fresh and filling. We were brought a host of banchan, side dishes, that include your kimchi of course, muchim (marinated cucumbers), bean sprouts and a few other things. Yum! We ordered a sushi roll and the japchae as apps. Japchae is my absolute favorite Korean meal. Made of noodles made out of sweet potato starch, its a savory noodle dish with sauteed veggies and meats (if you want to add it). The app serving was enough for me to split with 4 people, and definitely enough for a meal for one person. For entrees, between the four of us, we ordered two hot pots. The hot pots are between $30-$45 I believe, but its very worth it when considering the amount of food you get. We ordered the bulgogi hot pot and the seafood hot pot. I didnt try the bulgogi hotpot, but it looked amazing and they raved about it. The seafood hotpot came with octopus, mussels, shrimp, lots of veggies and some serious HEAT! With the leftovers, I honestly have enough for 3 or 4 meals, but probably definitely more.Their menu is fairly extensive. If you are looking for Korean food you will not be disappointed, but sometimes you will have some in your party who arent interested in trying Korean food--no worries. They also have your standard hibachi type meals. So there really are no cons about this place in my opinion. The location is fairly centrally located in North Charleston. You  turn at a light to get there from either side of the highway which is a plus. The service was A+ (TJ you were awesome), the food was amazing--I will without a doubt visit again."}, {"review_id": "cGunNsfNJhtpf30SbF70OQ", "user_id": "6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "This review is for the Korean BBQ side.  We made reservations and had high hopes this would be like the Korean BBQ places we loved in our last city.  Being the only game in town doing true Korean BBQ I had my concerns.  Competition in my last city made the places better as they knew you had other choices so they made sure you enjoyed the experience.   Things went downhill fast.  Despite checking in early for our reservation we watched as a walk in just before us was seated 20 mins after our reservation time.  It was another 45 minutes before we would finally get to our table that wasn't even ready when we got there.  We were given a pitcher of Soju as a \"Were Sorry\" but this was ridiculous.  We gave our order and then waited nearly 30 minutes before the sides arrived and the meat arrived 10 minutes later.  The table next to us who were seated before us had nothing on their table and were ready to walk out when their sides and meat finally arrived.     We ordered the next round when they delivered the first round as I knew they were going to be slow bringing more meat.  We cooked and finished the first round and waited 10 minutes for the 2nd round.  The meat portions were on the skimpy side and you are limited to 3 items per round.  They were 3 of us so it took 4 rounds before we were full.  The delivery between rounds was consistently slow.       The sides were OK and nothing special.  Sweet pickles and Kimchi were the standouts.  Missing was the Korean Potato Salad that seemed to be the norm at other Korean BBQ places.  The Bulgogi was really good but the other meats were just OK.  The service was atrocious - they seemed overwhelmed but to me I saw plenty of waiters and waitresses but they seemed confused as to what to do.  I have never had such bad service or been so disappointed in a Korean BBQ place.  I will not return as this is the worst restaurant experience I have had in years!!!  Should have given them 1 star but upped it due to the tasty Bulgogi."}, {"review_id": "UdF6ECcLaeBPddTxsYXk1g", "user_id": "QMyvWy45Te8Gh4DC0wYyfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "Today was our first time here, and is definitely not the last! Popped in for lunch at the sushi bar and the Korean BBQ smelled amazing. We were already in sushi mode, so we'll save the BBQ for next time. We seated ourselves at the sushi bar and soon a nice man took our drink orders and Alex the sushi chef stepped up. He was welcoming and personable, and gave us his full attention while also creating gorgeous sushi plates for the other diners seated in the restaurant area. Alex masterfully crafted nigiri and sushi rolls for us with fresh, lovely ingredients. The ama ebi (spot prawn) was some of the best I've ever had, presented with the tempura heads and all the little fried legs intact and a ponzu sauce especially for those bits, with the tails riding proudly atop perfectly formed and seasoned sushi rice. The conch was crisp-tender, not at all rubbery or chewy. The wasabi octopus was out of this world, and I savored every last bit of the soft, flavorful meat. The spicy tuna roll was spicier than expected in a good way, but the tuna flavor was a bit lost. The jalapeno roe was better than the orange, little grains of the sea popping in my mouth. The eel-avocado roll was as good as anywhere, with real eel.Alex gave us a tasting dish of jellyfish soaked in seaweed salad marinade, and it was incredible. A fantastic texture, as if a squid and some ocean plants had a baby. Very light, crisp, and refreshing. I will definitely try that one again!The interior is beautiful, with sparkling fish tanks throughout, including a small saltwater display of clownfish, anemones, and even an urchin at the sushi bar! Everyone was kind and friendly.
