Definitely the best smothered burrito I've ever had! (Backstreet burrito with barbacoa smothered in queso) along side with some of the best nachos I've had the pleasure of eating. The service was amazing and all the food was perfect. Be sure to get a parking pass from the restaurant. The ticket monsters were out while we ate at least once. The food came out fast, but not too fast like they may have microwaved it. And was very fresh and tasty."}, {"review_id": "5S1D2KCI3TWXEHoOijW67A", "user_id": "HYcp__PjevTrvwOgi7GToA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Ran across this place while roaming around old town, I had seen it while browsing on yelp so we gave it a try. They have a very nice patio area with big umbrellas and large comfy patio chairs. We went at around 1pm on a Monday so we were seated right away. We ordered a margarita, a beer, chips and salsa with added guacamole, fish tacos and steak tacos. Both the tacos came with a side of rice. Everything was really good. Steak and tilapia were very nicely seasoned and the fish tacos came with a yummy pineapple or mango salsa. The rice was seasoned with something that I couldn't quite but my finger on but was good. Wait staff were friendly and attentive. No complaints here, would recommend!"}, {"review_id": "Q2xOSvSpkT2yU3y9SqvLKw", "user_id": "37AkmoHU3sdRcc3hgBwbhQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "We went there for lunch  after participating in the march for our lives rally. Busy, but got a nice table in about 10 minutes. Food fabulous as was the service( Brooklyn took great care of us)!!!We shared shrimp tacos and 2 sides- black bean soup and New Mexican calabacitas.I had a great glass of red blend wine.Atmosphere nice and uncluttered.Prices within reason. I was suprised there were no New Mexicanwines on the menu. Overall a really nice experience.

We had intended to eat here a few weeks ago but another place that looked good slowed us down. So let try this one. First thing I noticed at the hostess station were \"rules\" huh? They *may* automatically add a 20% tip for your convenience. To me 20% is for over the top food and service - not average. Also split checks paid by credit cards will incur a service fee. Call me someone who doesn't understand the difference between 3 table of 1 person or 1 table of 3 people but it sounds similar to me. Oh well. It was a nice day and there weren't too many people on the patio so we opted for outside seating.  Ordered chimichurri calamari appetizer. It was delicious, light batter, not over cooked, dipping sauce was excellent. We ordered shrimp street tacos and barbacoa burrito for the mIn course.  This is where the wheels came off. The tacos were warm and the burrito was lukewarm. It seemed that both of them sat on the line too long with the tacos closer to the heat lamp than the burrito. One of the staff brought the food to the table and our server was rarely seen. Next trip to Old Town we'll seek out something different. These guys missed the target on this one."}, {"review_id": "ulElE_8ewV_cY9oUHwrAtw", "user_id": "4EIYka0L2YRGqTVcCaNLcw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Valentine's Day 2018 was shaping up to be, well, lonely. I was scheduled to travel to ABQ for work, and I was feeling less than excited just thinking about it. Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find a sweet spot to spend the evening.Back Street Grill provided a great meal! I had a couple glasses of Louis Martini cab and a steak salad that was recently added to the menu. The steak was expertly prepared to my preferred temp, medium rare, and the salad accoutrements-- roasted red peppers, bacon, hard boiled egg, roasted garlic cloves, bleu cheese, and a prickly pear dressing (I opted for their balsamic, though the prickly pear was good)-- were perfect. The service was excellent even though I opted to sit in the bar (it was Valentine's Day, and, ahem, table for one?). I think at least three people approached me to take my drink/food order in the first 15 minutes. Chris was an excellent server and made sure to attend throughout the meal. This place may, at first blush, seen like a bit of a hole in the wall. In reality, it's more like a hidden gem! I expect I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "jjaitET7MeRvr-4ILYNQPQ", "user_id": "NmVOTj2jzsmozd1APHx87w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Ah, Old Town. You tourist trappy, old school New Mexican, kitsch and bauble filled place, you. I love Old Town. Give me a say free to do whatever, and often times you will find me talking the hubby into going to wander the shops there. I wanted to love Backstreet  Grill. It's cute, the menu is interesting, and it's in Old Town. I'm sad to report that my two experiences here were just meh, and it makes my heart sad.First of all, the food is pretty darn good. Both times, I had the mini Chimi's with barbacoa. It's basically 3 smaller chimi's and a large bowl of queso. How could you go wrong?! You can't, that's how! The queso is a bit spicier than I prefer, but it's ok. I'm a sissy. It's melty and cheesy and delicious. On our second visit, we ordered the tableside guacamole. Delicious, but the way it was made was offputting. Our server brought everything table side... and then proceeded to make it with his back to us so that we couldn't really see what he was doing or putting in there. Weird, IMO. It was delicious though. The food is not the issue at this place.Service makes or breaks any establishment for me. No one should be waiting 10 minutes by the cold front door to at the very least be acknowledged, if not seated. The place wasn't busy either visit yet we waited for ages to be greeted and then seated. C'mon, people. Both servers were... inattentive. Maybe I'd like a refill of my drink, ya know? Maybe. We'll never know because no one checked. Lastly... this joint automatically puts a 20% tip on the ticket. That's all fine and dandy but I would like the discretion to change that WITHOUT talking to a manager who can't even be found. These servers aren't earning 20% based on our two experiences here, and I watched the table next to us add additional tip because they didn't notice it. Sorry, but that just feels shady to me folks."}, {"review_id": "Y9RWoBnqqD99zsRXIp0rkg", "user_id": "0x2oY30cZU6PnkfBJ1kxbA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Decent food. One star service. Hostess behaved as though she didn't know what day it was. Left me waiting minutes to be seated and did the same to the next 3 parties that came in. Each time, she would finally appear at the hostess stand and say \"sorry about that, guys\" before showing them to a table, where the wait was another 10 minutes to be acknowledged. Restaurant was not  busy yet the waitress couldn't seem to keep up. Between her and the hostess, it looked like they needed a manager there, or some further training. Tried to get to a tour and gave myself a 40 minute window to get some guac and a coke. Missed the tour. Waitress kept disappearing saying she had to go do something \"real quick\".

I was tasked with finding a great place to eat as the Yelpie of the group. After seeing a solid 4 star rating with 500+ reviews, I thought this place would knock it out of the park. Unfortunately, the food was just awful.I ordered the Backstreet Burrito with spicy Barbacoa beef, zesty queso cheese sauce, and a side of rice. Everything was just really, really bad. The beef was tough and chewy and too spicy for my liking. The beef was just spicy without any flavor to it whatsoever. The queso sauce looked ages old and tasted old. I'd prefer Tostitos con queso dip over this. The rice was dried out and the portion was sad. Although I was starving, I finished about half of my burrito and pushed it away. The menonita cheese wasn't even melted either. Sad, sad, sad. My two dining companions also didn't enjoy their friend. As a Yelp Elite, it was a horror story to have my friends tell me that Yelp was wrong and this place sucked. Our waitress was super sweet and was nice enough to give our entire table 10% off for my Yelp check in, but jeez this was awful. After two mediocre, almost boozeless margaritas and this sad burrito, my bill came out to nearly $40. Heed my warning and stay far, far away. This was the worst meal I've had in a while."}, {"review_id": "eh1S9O_SQMOMyHYIwdvWkw", "user_id": "qxH98Uv7S_vGDpldBrrwKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "This was our first time here and Jamie served us.

This cute cafe is nestled on the corner of old town, surrounded by old town feel and is known as the \"home of the street taco\". We started with local beer, and la onza Belgian white is the smoothest I've ever tasted.We split the duck tacos and the pork shoulder enchiladas. The duck tacos were amazing, all the southwest fusion in this taco was noticeable... corn and queso fresco really highlights the duck. I've never had a duck taco before, but this will be hard to beat! The enchiladas were good, we ordered Christmas style which is common in NM, a mix of red and green Chile sauce. These enchiladas were not rolled like we are used to in Texas but were more like a stack of three smothered tortillas with layers of Pico, avocado, smoked pork and cheese. I enjoyed these paired with the rice, and the Mennonite cheese is what stood out most! This cheese made the entire dish so worth it! Great spot, feels local, awesome for my first time in ALQ!
