This can get really messy! Staff is friendly and it's located right next to Tazikis! I came in just out of curiosity. What really triggered my sweet tooth instinct was when I had the sample of their cinnamon donut. Oh. My. IT WAS AMAZING. It was fluffy and cake-y on the inside and had a soft and sweet outer. Once you pick your own donut, glaze and toppings, you can watch the donuts come out of the donut fryer, where they will grab it and take it to the toppings bar. There was a range of glazes, and toppings. I enjoyed the blueberry glaze and one other one, I ate it so fast I forgot. Yum!!"}, {"review_id": "fz_TKoJw64Ut9qc2Lpbkfw", "user_id": "Oz21pBYHtf1DkcqmcUhhAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "This place was awesome! The girl up front was super helpful and very patient with me as I had no idea what I was doing. When I walked in she explained to me how, the doughnuts were made fresh, as I watched them being made right in front of me. I am not usually a doughnut fan, but when they are made fresh like this I here for it. I did some cool stuff to my doughnut and I kind of wished I had ordered three, but I am working on self control. I really had to display it this day.I thought they were fairly priced as well and you can get everything from  soda to cold milk  to enjoy with your \"duck doughnuts\"They are also located in this very cute and trendy are, atleast to me it was. I am not super familiar with Columbia but I am quite certain they see plenty of traffic being this close to Fort Jackson.If I am ever in the area, the tasty doughnuts and friendly service will bring me back."}, {"review_id": "dS_nP-s5HOaEByo2QwjDdg", "user_id": "icrsYih960Zkh5jfRjaRKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Anytime I'm in the Columbia area , duck donuts are a must!

I came here last Saturday after leaving Taziki's (next door) and brought my husband. We are familiar with this chain because we lived close to Rockville, MD location.

Most of the times we come here the donuts are made incredibly sloppy compared to how they were initially when they first opened this location. The donuts are so warm that often times the toppings are just melting and sliding off. There is a difference between a fresh doughnut and one that is way too hot to keep the toppings in place. I posted some pictures and made a remark about how the donuts are not up to their usual standards and I received an apology and was asked to give my mailing address, I'm assuming for a coupon of some sort. Yet after several weeks I have never received anything in the mail so I don't know why they needed my mailing address. I suppose we will come here on occasion but we will stick with Krispy Kreme. Original review:It can get very busy here!! But it moves fast! Basically when you come in you'll see a sign with the sample menu of classic favorites and the paper order sheets with little  golf pencils to write in your orders. Order as many or as little as you like! :) for a dozen and a bottle of soda it was $16.90, that includes tax. The donuts are warm, fresh and not too sweet. They have a yummy little crispy crunch to them like you'd find with homemade donuts. So far we love it! Employees are great and they only messed up one donut out of 12 but quickly fixed it. Seating and tables are extremely limited... Think \"marble slab\" ice cream shops."}, {"review_id": "HwhwjwTu2v5HoAyCwj_aAw", "user_id": "KJKve0ZMiXzI1z6oM4tnbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Another stop accomplished...This spot is cool depending totally on your personal preference. Everything is made fresh to order and the flavor combinations are exponentially endless. Made to order cake donuts and you pick any combo of toppings you would like. The order form is set up for you to let your imagination run freely or be simple and play it safe. Once you figure out your combos for your order you give it to the cashier and watch the process as your creations come to life right before your eyes. The process and choices can be slightly overwhelming to a newbie but the shop and employees are friendly, knowledgeable and patient. Once your order is complete they give you the final option to \"ok\" the finish product and then you are on your way. The highlight is the icing and toppings the donut itself basic (not in a negative way). If you are creative you can really have some fun. Heads up they are warm so one downside is that some of your creativity tends to slide off in the box. Overall great to try if your are going to be adventurous but if you want a simple glazed donut go with what you already know."}, {"review_id": "dFAZ-X1PZllsCc8hTx5YXw", "user_id": "nPvk7a7C-wp7TQE3Po6akw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "Duck Donuts is a great concept. All donut bases are the same (vanilla cake) and then you get to choose from a large variety of options for toppings. They have several laminated sheets with different suggestions -- when I went they had a Campfire sheet, Christmas sheet, and some of their traditional combos. You grab a pencil and paper menu and mark your order; turn it into the cashier, pay, and wait for your order to be called. The donuts were freshly cooked and freshly topped, then the person who made my order took the time to explain which donuts were which and I was on my way. Of my order, favorites were the maple bacon and raspberry / blackberry combo. I honestly don't think you can go wrong though; just order the flavors you prefer! Only downside is that because the donuts are made to order, it takes more time than popping in your average donut shop. But I went in knowing this and had no problem waiting for my fresh order."}, {"review_id": "jLIMr0UznTlJ4BLfCwgrnw", "user_id": "NWS0vCCKlMkLua4D3FBLrg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "We tried Duck Donuts this Sunday morning.

Each donut starts \"bare\" then you pick your coating, topping and optional drizzle! We got a half dozen; maple bacon, mint oreo with chocolate drizzle, blueberry and powdered sugar, glazed with sprinkles, peanut butter with graham cracker and marshmallow and cinnamon sugar with vanilla drizzle.

Being our first time, we just walked up and started ordering off the printed cards in front of the register. The cards offer a lot of choices so it can be intimidating the first time.What we should have done is went left when we walked in and grabbed an order card from the stand. Then we should have sat down at one of the tables and marked what we wanted. Instead, we stood at the register and came up with a dozen options. The girl working the register was patient with us even though the morning sun was blinding her.The donuts are all the same base, so the toppings are the stars. The base is a cake donut, but it's lighter than normal. It might use some pastry flour in the mix. The donuts are also made as you order so they are about as fresh as possible.The fresh donuts are then moved to the toppings stand and assembled. We ordered 12 different topping combinations and we had our dozen in about 10 minutes.Ones I remember are the maple bacon and maple bacon with raspberry drizzle. I also really liked the lemon with powdered sugar. All were good, some excellent.

You don't have to come to SC to try these I discover after I Google it. There are even franchises in MD, my neck of the woods. Review the rating for your local franchise though because quality control must be loose. Some Yelpers write about how much better this DD is than theirs. I hope the magic doesn't die as it ages. What I witnessed today was super hyped. The employees were at their best. Us buyers were excited too, a perfect scenario.I stumbled over this place. Yesterday I went to Whole Foods, in the same shopping center, and I saw the DD with the line out on the sidewalk. It was about 85 degrees outside. What the f***! I say to myself. I drive slowly from Whole Foods and decided to come back and try this place. After all, the bakers at Whole Foods aren't slouches. For this place to have lines forming for donuts when there is a Whole Food Store in the same shopping center is amazing. Today I know why. Ain't nothing better than a warm made-to-order donut except a 2nd made-to-order warm donut. LMAO while I think about how good the 2nd uneaten donut will taste later. Yeah, As good as it gets."}, {"review_id": "yr70sZ04Yl1724jvdodbZw", "user_id": "vthSLGfTLGKkltEMQks9Pg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/25/2017", "text": "Delicious donuts! When you enter grab an order sheet and fill out what you want. I totally suggest the Maple Bacon and a lemon glaze with raspberry drizzle. Noms! Then hop in line and turn in your form at the register and pay. Then you get to watch the donuts being created! This was the best/worst part for me. Best because it's cool to watch the process and see what other people ordered. Worst because you're salivating just waiting to sink into one of those puppies and because you might start wondering if you should have ordered what the person in front of you ordered! It all looks so good. Everyone was friendly and patient as we all figure out the process and took time to review our many donut options. I also appreciate that they ask you if everything looks correct before closing up your box and handing it over. I look forward to the time when the lines aren't so long!

They donut itself was great along with the fun decoration. I would have like chocolate cake too, but I totally understand white cake is what you get.

So I always like to give all types of food a chance, even if they're a little \"out there.\" And I would say, Duck Donuts definitely gives off that \"different\" appeal, especially if you base it strictly on the name.This donut shop just opened up not too long ago in Columbia and I had heard about it briefly, but I had only ever heard of it being available in the West coast. So when it was announced that our side of the country would be getting one, I was immediately excited to try it. I love donuts, so anything remotely different being offered in the form of one of my favorite desserts is always a sure thing in my book.My mom and I took our chances and decided to give it a go and boy am I glad we did. So being new to this donut shop, among about 90% of the other people in line, we took a long gander at the menu before making our final decision. They offer various different flavors and customizations you can add and create based on your likes and interests of flavors. You start with a base coat (chocolate, vanilla, lemon, strawberry, glazed, etc.) and then one you make your decision you can also choose toppings. Since this was our first rodeo, we decided to play it safe and just go with the flavored coating. We got a half dozen donuts with 2 strawberry, 2 chocolate, and 2 glazed. Once you put in your order, you pay and wait for your order to be made (they make them fresh to order). It took maybe 5 minutes to make the donuts and when we got them, they were warm and ready to be consumed. The first one I tried was the strawberry flavor and I can honestly say I was overly pleased. I think I saw Jesus after I tasted the first bite. These donuts are made fresh to order, so they have a fried taste and a slight crisp to them which makes them very lite. They melted in my mouth and were extremely soft. I prefer the texture of these donuts to that of Krispy Kreme, they're THAT good.I will say, the only thing I didn't too much care for was the price. A half dozen is give or take about $7.85 (including tax) and that, my friend, is HIGH. I can easily go to Krispy Kreme and get a whole dozen for that price. But I will say this, the price is worth it because every donut is made fresh to order. So you don't get any old, stale donuts in your order like you sometimes would at Krispy Kreme. Now waiting for the hot sign to come on here, they're always hot! They also have different toppings you can add. So essentially, the price is about right for what you're getting.Overall, I would give this shop a 4.8/5 because of the quality and how pleased I was with the service and the quality of what I received. I would definitely say that this is a place you go to indulge maybe once a month due to the price. But if you can get past that, go as often as you can because they're to be experience AT LEAST once!"}, {"review_id": "0ymw99Yg7n03yIxK7xO3JQ", "user_id": "Dye3Ey1zcuAvoFycmyzr-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "If you love those tasty mini donuts from the fair well get ready.
