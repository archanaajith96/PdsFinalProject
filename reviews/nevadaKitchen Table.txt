We waited for 50 minutes, even though we did the check in online. We were seated outside but was never given a choice of inside or outside but I guess it was busy inside so we didn't have a choice.After we were seated we waiting over 20 minutes for the waitress to take our drink order but we put the food order in too since we had a lot of time to look at the menu. It took a good 15-20 minutes before we got our drink order and not once did the anyone check in on us. When the food finally came out my order which is the simple breakfast of toast, eggs, potatoes and bacon, came out with 3 of the 4 items wrong. My order was regular bacon, wheat toast and scrambled eggs. The order that came out was white toast, jalapeños bacon and sunny side up eggs. Our normal waitress didn't bring it out and I knew it was someone else's order but we kept waiting and waiting and no one came. Again, not once did anyone come by to check on us. My husband finally went into to tell the waitress the issue and she came out to give me a plate of scrambled eggs, by that time I realized the bacon was oddly spicy and I don't eat spice. We had to wave her down again and she tried bringing me a whole new plate with the right stuff but we were already too put off by the lack of service, follow through and correct food order. We had to get up to ask for ketchup and by Type of water refill. It wasn't that busy outside and everyone else's waitress and food seemed ok except for ours. My husband said his food was good but due to the terrible service, we will never be coming back here again."}, {"review_id": "_HtF9z1O8Bi0INjqgDnezQ", "user_id": "fQ5oCdq6E3ZPhhR9rNmm6g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "It was a mediocre experience for our first time there. It started off by us not liking the fact we couldn't add ourselves to the seating list unless 10 min away. Once we arrived we waited 1 hour to be seated at a wobbly table with a dirty window sill. By a host that wasn't to pleasant upon walking in. Maybe because they were very busy but there was no warm welcome.  I myself ordered the ice tea and Po Boy Crab sandwich which stated came with chips. A \"salad\" with no dressing is not chips.  Paid $15 for lovely looking avacado. Nothing special about my plate. I even had to ask for sweetener half way through my sandwich. The second plate was the chilequilles. Wich was okay but nothing special either. Overall the experience was nothing worthy of coming back. Overpriced food for 1 hour wait. The Mimosa in a cup and avacado is what we paid $40 for. And they asked on the receipt for 25% tip!! Wow they should be cleaner and more pleasant for asking that much on the receipt."}, {"review_id": "AnjRsqUfDJqeqz-FH9Y_9g", "user_id": "LGa1GmTItb4bu6HI7KPKfA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "My wife and I got burnt out with all the overpriced, trendy restaurants in Vegas so we decided to venture out to nearby cities for other options.  Henderson area seemed to have several good restaurants, and the location seemed family friendly, so we decided to check out this place as our first option.I was rather amazed with the food here.  Even compared to many of the breakfast places in OC and LA, I thought this place was better than most of them.  I always have a tough time eating out for breakfast because traditional breakfast items are extremely boring to me.  I didn't find too many boring items here.  Almost everything on the menu looked good, and this place did a great job making enough tweaks and twists on traditional items to make them interesting.  Even the maple syrup at this place isn't typical.  It uses Noble brand maple syrup, which is matured in charred oak barrel with a little bit of bourbon.  It has a rather distinct, robust taste compared to other maple syrups.I had a tough time deciding what to order because I wanted to order at least 70% of the items on the menu.  I eventually narrowed it down and went with Monkey Bread, Peaches and Cream Pancakes, and Shorty Benedict.The Monkey Bread seems to be the most popular item here because almost every table ordered one.  It's a simple bread glazed with salted caramel and cinnamon sugar.  It's served warm on a cast iron skillet.  At first bite it kind of reminded me of a cinnamon bun, but more dense and less sweet (due to lack of icing).  I didn't think it was mind-blowing or anything to have an orgasm over, but still very good.  I definitely would recommend this to all first time visitors.  Peaches and Cream Pancakes were simply delicious. My wife said it was the best pancakes she ever had.  I thought this was going to be too sweet and rich, but it was actually just right.  There was enough sweetness but certainly not overwhelming.  It was good even without any syrup, but I still poured a little bit on, just so I can experience what Noble brand syrup tastes like.  Shorty is a braised short rib Benedict, which comes with poached eggs, red wine reduction, and hollandaise on English muffin.  Eggs were poached perfectly and short rib was very tender.  This place also has a decent selection of beer, wine, mimosas, and few other alcoholic beverages.  I didn't see one on the menu but I saw some people drinking Bloody Mary, so there may be other alcoholic beverages not listed on the menu.The restaurant is difficult to see from the parking lot because it's located diagonally on the corner.  Just look for Shabu Shabu Paradise, which is located next to this place.  This place is pretty popular around here.  We came little before 11 a.m. on a Monday and had to wait about half hour for our table. Luckily the food came out fairly quickly once we were seated.  Service was friendly and attentive."}, {"review_id": "HeUP-j3hcFdotGk1jf1Q2g", "user_id": "88FUpkjKJMfXkALACGddQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Food is wonderful the Monte Cristo was perfect!  The social bucket a great deal (just remember to add the juice to your cup first and pour the champagne SLOW).  I will be back here as many times as possibleWhile I am here to try the rest of the menu!!!!  The Benedict's look amazing and a lot of people ordered them so they must be good!!!  Definitely a must go to!!"}, {"review_id": "02Pw-V-aPYQ-KekzCAAmtQ", "user_id": "D3fOi-5w4intrUTWXzIQew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Really great brunch spot with Good Vibes and long lines. Just a tip the Yelp check-in time is not accurate as when we arrived on time according to Yelp we still had according to the host 40 minutes but it actually only took 17 minutes to get seated.Started off with the sausage sampler which was amazing with the little cups of syrup my favorite of the selection was the Texas hot link.Was in a Benedict mood so we ordered the short rib Benny as well as the pork belly Benedict. Both were delectable and the eggs were poached to perfection. To drink I had a Mexican hot chocolate which I wish the marshmallows were toasted a bit more. I really like it whenever they're almost black! Also the regular coffee was pretty legit to.My only complaint was that the water glasses smell like rotten eggs and fish. Not the water just the glass itself because I ordered sparkling water and when I smelled the glass with the sparkling water in it it smelled pretty bad."}, {"review_id": "h2w3NJ2elWlXzFfhFEet1w", "user_id": "qA_MpzwfOal2rGvWl6ZyDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Vegetable Sandwich.

The pine nuts in this sandwich gives the sandwich a roasted taste and the extra crunch to it. The mozzarella cheese makes the sandwich very cheesy.

When we got there we checked in thinking it would be a short wait but we were told an additional 20-30 minutes. Right after I checked in I got an email saying I was taken off the waitlist. We waited and waited watching people who arrived after us being seated. After 30 minutes we asked if we were close to being seated. The hostess informed me she emailed me 25 minutes earlier to say our table was ready. For one I did not get any email saying our table was ready. Secondly we were sitting 5 feet from the hostess stand and she had been regularly calling out names of parties the entire time. Why couldn't she call out my name considering I was sitting right there?We were finally seated and met by our waitress. We told her about the waitlist situation and expressed that now we were in a crunch to get to our appointment on time because of the hostess's mistake. She quickly took our order and our food arrived in under 5 minutes. We were very pleased with her service and for taking the time to listen and care about our situation.I had the pork belly eggs Benedict and the monkey bread.

Everything I've tasted on their menu has been spectacular. They have plenty of options for your sweet (strawberry shortcake French toast, or peaches and cream pancake) or savory (croque madame or tacos huevos) cravings, and they offer gluten-free versions of many of their dishes. Their Mexican Hot Chocolate with torch-blown marshmallows is as beautiful as it is delicious (see attached photo), and their \"Social Bucket\" of champagne (one bottle, your choice of juice, and as many glasses as you can fill) is the perfect way to start off your meal with friends. A warning: this place is ALWAYS busy on the weekends. However, you can join the waiting list through Yelp! so that you do not have to physically be at the restaurant in order to get in line. If you use this feature, though, you are still required to check in with the hostess once you arrive. My only complaint with this is that they often times give you a 20-ish minute window of time for when you will be seated, and you are seated towards the end of that window (if not a bit beyond it) more often than not. But that's what happens when you decide to dine at one of the best breakfast / brunch places in town (and it sure beats not getting on the waiting list at all, and having to wait for a full hour or more to be seated)!"}, {"review_id": "ieIeTfu14IbMG2x8WH0_lA", "user_id": "nUVouVVsHPMOQanZX2okrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I sat outside in the shade with quite a lovely little breeze. The environment is perfect for a brunch date with myself. To start, I had just one peach and creme pancake. The homemade whipped creme is to die for with a little drizzle of the Tahitian vanilla bean & Egyptian chamomile blossom matured maple syrup. THIS WILL NOT DISAPPOINT.  It was a challenge not to eat the whole thing before I dove into the Chilaquiles, which were good. They might have been even better but I'm afraid I slightly spoiled my meal with the decadent pancake first.

I left satisfied but not blown away (especially given the wait time).We had the peaches and cream pancakes and the country benedict, both of which were good (8 out of 10). Pancakes cooked perfectly, the peaches, cream and syrup weren't too sweet. It's also a large portion, enough for leftovers. The country benedict was a biscuit with country fried steak, poached eggs and chipotle gravy. Great flavor and filling.For $12, the crab and avocado dip was disappointing. It's more like a queso - 90% cheese, some poblano pepper, about 1/3 of an avocado, and very little crab.I love the waitlist function thru Yelp, but the wait was longer than estimated and I noticed some people who arrived after others (no reservation, no waitlist) and yet they were seated before them. Once seated, service was also very slow. It took a while for the server to take our order and a long time for the food to come out. As a frame of reference, we put ourselves on the waistlist at 12:35, arrived at 12:50, seated at 1:30, received our food at 2:15pm - on a weekday :/"}, {"review_id": "M_qLiBuxBQ-aUn3TvyFh5w", "user_id": "IIQjl4ckL2lWPrqV2ZGAtA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "The wait was long (granted, it was a Saturday morning during brunch time).

We were seated outside, per our request (unfortunately)  the table behind ours had a dog!!!!It kept shaking its head & drool & slobber was being slung all over!!!! TOTALLY DISGUSTING!!!Not sure why a dog is allowed outside next to other patrons & wagging its tail & the owner would not keep it next to HIS OWN table!!!! The best thing about this place was our server, Ilse- she was very informative about the menu & had good suggestions too. I'm very surprised this place had so many stars for their rating!!!! Just a heads up, look before you are seated & order!!!

It came with 3 tacos that had potatoes, scrambled eggs, pico and avocado. It came with a Salsa that was very good. Unfortunately the tacos weren't really anything special. Besides the salsa it really lacked flavor but maybe I should have went on a different direction with my food selection because my friend got the meatless Benedict and she loved it. We also got the crab avocado dip. That thing is cheeeeeeeesy! It was pretty good. Artichokes would be a perfect fit in that dish if they ever want to change it up. Because the dip is good but if they make that into a Avocado spinach artichoke crab dip...  now that would be a hit!  The staff was great.
