It has like a bar/lounge atmosphere but with no alcohol. They also play loud music so it definitely gives that type of vibe. I definitely didn't have this kind of stuff growing up. We only had two options, the mall or the movie theaters. Now a days they just keep on getting more creative.Their drinks are pretty good for a fair descent price. I ordered the foxy brown which is a sweeter version of Thai iced tea. The only problem with this place is how the cash register is set up. It's at the end of the counter so when it gets backed up the line goes out the door which doesn't stay open. So basically if your by the door you have to hold it open til the line starts moving and the person behind you holds the door open next. But I see what their doing, it's a gimmick. When the line is out the door it brings attraction to the place. Nice marketing idea. But overall that would be my only problem with the place. I prolly won't be coming here often only for that simple fact, but every once in a while would be fine."}, {"review_id": "DY1T_bQQWybXmc994dwIeQ", "user_id": "2sJhb4ZChITiv0Jo9mKGrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "After having a nice dinner with the fam on a Saturday evening, we were craving for pearl tea. They recommended to try Pekoe. When we arrived, the line was already out the door. The place was small for a large crowd, even with outdoor tables available. Pekoe is a lot different compared the others I'd been to. The dark interior lighting and comfortable white leather couches had the look of a club vibe. I heard they even had DJs on busy nights! Instead of board games, you can play Street Fighter on PS4. The menu had really unusual funny names from Manly Melon to Pretty in Pink. It felt like I was at a bar ordering a margarita or mojito lol. I decided to go for the Pretty in Pink. It was a little too sweet for me, so I highly recommend to tell them your ice and sugar levels. They did offer a split cup option for two flavors in one!I wouldn't mind coming here again and try Pekoe flavors, but on less busy times."}, {"review_id": "dTu0ovozvRccCzAWw03Q7w", "user_id": "ePs6jt7AqJtm4Qx2VQT71w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Really well known spot in SJ - as evidenced by the extremely long line you can spot from the street! Cool concepts with drink recipes and the split drink, pictured below. They are efficient with the ordering process, but you should really know what you want by the time you're up! You'll have plenty of time to think about it while standing in line though. The couches and tables inside mimic a club, and the lighting is the same. The only issues I ran into were that there were no napkins available, and I had to run into the bathroom in order to clean up a small spill - and the bathroom itself wasn't clean at all. I can understand being busy and having that slide but in a food place it's nice to have clean, easy access to napkins and a bathroom. Excited to come back though, and try all their other recipes!"}, {"review_id": "p1Zug6hMcjuOf6Qax0Z8zQ", "user_id": "uJzFxTYzs6fQViOuxjkBLA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "After my poor experience with the service and buzzers, I came back about 4 times. The first return I came in on a busy night so I understood the wait. The next two visits there weren't as many ppl and barely a wait. However, both times the buzzer did not work. The workers are on and off with the buzzers. The second  visit, I went in to check my drinks to yet again see my drinks were done, but not called for. No one shouted the orders or anything so it was time wasted waiting for my drinks that were already done. The third visit, the cashier noted that they may not work and personally checked on our order for us. I really appreciated that. So basically the buzzers were on and off and the service/check ups regarding drinks was on and off also.  My last visit today was super smooth. It was by far the quickest Pekoe visit ever. I ordered my drinks and within 5-10 minutes my order of 4 drinks was ready with the golden buzzer working--huzzah! Idk if they are all fixed or if I finally got a functioning buzzer. Drinks are always bomb. A bit too sweet though so I'd suggest to lower the sweetness. I was told the standard sweetness level is at 50%. They have a new drink called Thai tea whitties, which is basically green Thai tea drink + pudding. Super creamy and delicious--highly recommend. My go to drink is lady in pink. It's a bit too sweet so I'd suggest getting 25%. Other drinks I like are gold mine, manly melons, & pomstar.Overall, good drinks, but the wait, on&off service, and faulty buzzers dock a star."}, {"review_id": "NNCMBLolsP_y1jAWfzIeFA", "user_id": "K5HX4sQvub4j7zkmZ5-3bw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Ive always seen long lines leading to Pekoe. So I decided to try it out and I was blown away! From their ambiance to their service, down to their drinks, its all amazing! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU TRY!! Pekoe has a lively lounge atmosphere. It's so different than any other boba shop i've been to. Whenever I've gone to Pekoe I've always seen people really enjoying themselves! Whether they be playing games on Pekoe's T.V. or just hanging out with friends everyone seems to enjoy themselves there! When it comes to costomer service Pekoe is on top of it! Service is always given with a smile! I once forgot to ask them not to add ice to me drink and I told one of their staff members and they were so sweet about it! They redid my drink, no problem! They're drinks are quality drinks! They have something for everyone! You can adjust your sweetness higher or lower as well as the strength of your tea and even your ice! My favorite milk tea so far is Pekoe Special, it tastes like fruity pebbles! My other favorite is Angela, its just so unique! I've never tried anything like it!"}, {"review_id": "Lp4uCjVAkcGJx75X-WG-UQ", "user_id": "4zk97-yxc68PBYhFrZ8ZYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "I gradually approached the shop noticing two things: huge line and an unexpected setting. This was on a Saturday night around 9:30 PM. For a second, I thought maybe my GPS made a mistake and led me to another Pekoe. But nope, this is the shop. The boba shop I was referred to try.Initially, I was fairly intimidated by the long line. It reminded me of another boba shop I frequented with lines snaking out the door. However, the line moved by fast! There were TWO registers opened and upon leaving my order, I received it within 10 min. max. A star for efficiently handling orders!For my first visit, I ordered their Manly Melons and Gold Mine in a split cup for $6.00 ($3.00 per flavor). I also ordered a CoolCucumber in a regular cup for $4.95. CoolCucumber normally comes with basil seeds but at the time of my visit, they were out. :( So I substituted for agar pearls. I was a little surprised because I thought their drinks were $4.50 each. It seems that split cups are generally more expensive that regular cups. There's also less serving of tea per half (which is disappointing). I didn't notice the price break down until I checked my receipt via email.Although it's not quite my taste, I have to admit that this shop has a very unique design. It's a bar-like atmosphere but (ironically) doesn't sell alcohol (that I know of at least). This is something that I haven't seen in other boba shops - I've been to many around the bay area! Another star for uniqueness.I think something they can do is improve their cup design. The store itself is very fancy, but I feel the cups aren't on the same level (i.e. the stickers and writing on the cup don't look presentable). Though it isn't that important. After all, drink quality matters most.Customer service was normal. It wasn't bad neither was it good. However, I'll try asking questions next time and probably update this paragraph.Pekoe is located in a plaza shared with other stores. Parking is ample but during peak hours it may be a little difficult to find parking in front of the store.Although the store's a little out-of-the-way from where I live, I look forward to coming back and try their other drinks!"}, {"review_id": "Ewzv-uTTJKTOKZ57F9D73Q", "user_id": "j8m6Qn1aCwSYEBbXlVGgGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Pekoe falls in the top tier of my boba rankings below and I even went to this venue on back to back days...Drinks that I love besides the standard milk tea are:Foxy brown - delish !!Thai tea whitey - looks unappealing but tastes bomb ! 101 boba spots and counting in the Bay Area (yes you read that correctly One hundred and one..)

Maybe I was just blinded my the new-ness back then or more/better tea shops opened since Pekoe to which I enjoy better.I don't really like the pearls here, they're never the right consistency. The pearls are not of a soft chewy texture, but more of a chunky, hard gelatin consistency to me. Not sure if that made sense, but I've been disappointed by the pearls here enough that I've switched to getting grass jelly. They also serve hot drinks, but they don't have a milk steamer, so hot drinks are microwaved. I mean not every tea shop wants to invest in an espresso machine, but just something about buying a microwaved drink gets to me.The line and waits here have gotten ridiculous. Even after waiting in line for awhile to order, you have to wait even longer for your drinks. I personally hate the layout of the whole place. It is way too small to accommodate so many people just waiting for drinks. The bar takes up half the shop and the drinks aren't even made there. Honestly, they need to get rid of the bar area, to open up the seating area since there are only 5 seats at the bar anyways and all it's used for is the cash register. The hype around this place is (was?) really just the ambiance. But now, even that's gone because it is way too overcrowded making for long wait times standing in a crowded, uncomfortably warm room."}, {"review_id": "OVbn7rOw0C3dP3vFYSwlHw", "user_id": "MssuswjZM28Kv9WYFmKn-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Come here every Friday with my best friend.

They describe it as some kind of club with really hot Asian girls, and I can see why. Tables that light up, hip hop and rnb music, white couches, a bar to sit and chat with the workers when they're less busy (but this is never the case, went on a Sunday afternoon and the line was out the door). For my first time here, I got the Pekoe Special described as a \"Black Earl Grey milk tea infused with Lavender and Orange Bergamot. Complimented with silky grass jelly and honey black pearls.\" Lemme tell ya'll...I understand the hype. The viscosity of this drink is different than your standard drink. It's a lot thicker than usual, so given time when the ice melts, it'll taste better than you expect it to. I will say the lavender overshadows the orange hints in parallel with earl grey, but they do go great together! Might as well name this drink Lil' Thiccy My friend ordered the Pink Drink, I can attest the viscosity of this drink was very thick as well. I think that's the secret to why this place is so good. It's not watered down, it's full of flavor, and it gives the right amount of boba/ice/drink ratio.--based off standard ice and sugar orders. Consistency will change if you adjust ice and sweetness! (From previous boba barista experience) Every drink is 4.50, and they charge .50 for additional toppings. Fair in my opinion!

The thing that definitely sets apart from other places is the quality of the products. No doubt that the drinks are so tasty and each put with love and thought. You can even customize your cups with a choices of a cute light bulb or a split cup with dual flavor! I drive past Pekoe everyday and there is never time where isn't a line or empty. I know friends that are not from around and they would drive all the way to pekoe just for a drink. I remember coming here with a bunch on friends and ended sipping and chatting for 3 hours. We loved grooving with the awesome music as well! Not only that, it's a great place with a beautiful set up to lounge with friends, take some selfies and play some video games on the TV. People from Kids, teens, adults, families and basically anyone come with great vibes and smiles on their faces. One drink that I absolutely LOVE is Thai-Tea Whities. If you like matcha, then this drink is for you. This drink is very creamy and very tasty. It has the smooth, milky matcha flavor tea and is complemented with sea salt creama on top and milk pudding on the bottom.  Let's not forget about the costumer service which is excellent and they workers will not hesitate to satisfy you. They are very organized and have a smooth system when pumping out the drinks. Cashiers will take their time to take customers orders so that they are happy with the drinks to their fitting and will always greet you when you come in and walk out. And the ambience inside makes you want to come back for more...and I have many times!! If my word isn't convincing, come by and try it!!

The line can get definitely long at night or on the weekends, but that is because customers are willing to wait to get their drinks. They also have generated lots of popularity for their split cups, light bulb bottles, and cups w/ an LED light.
