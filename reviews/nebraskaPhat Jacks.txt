I stopped in for lunch and really enjoyed their burnt ends. They have delicious cornbread too! Their new facility on West O is very clean and a perfect atmosphere. They serve award winning BBQ and it's easy to see why. If you want some of Lincoln's best BBQ, try Phat Jack's."}, {"review_id": "tt-VQwPTjAvbl_ooEF8LGA", "user_id": "aqrHo9VLdQGDboXuujAarg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Went here because it was highly rated, and I must say I'm impressed. They have a great touch on their Kansas City barbecue. I got the Brisket Sandwich and it was very good. It was a little saucy, but that's Kansas Barbecue for ya!

I'm here for the meat not the sides. The meat - as mentioned the burnt ends are very good.  the rest of the meat i saw looked good, but i didn't try it.  The atmosphere - pretty chill, they serve beer.  It's literally a bit box of a restaurant with counter service.  Cell service... this place is a tin box and my phone's service (ATT) stinks already.  Needless to say, I ate by myself in silence with no cell service in the building.  It was nice to not be attached to it for a few minutes.  The workers were friendly and i'll definitely be back next time i'm in town.. and will proceed to run an extra mile.  Huge portions."}, {"review_id": "voUtkaVymMdz0i2DkXtMFg", "user_id": "WURKcovGfgYzb7S7Hmxgjw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "Phat Jacks is a microcosm of the whole Lincoln food scene. It is above average BBQ....which was disappointing taking into consideration that everyone in Lincoln raves about it. We had the platter for two so we could sample a lot of different things. The ribs were good, but a little too salty and slightly overcooked. The smoked pulled pork was average. The beans tasted like they opened a can of Boston baked beans and added some hunks of meat. The cole slaw was as good as cole slaw can be. The only thing that really stood out was the brisket. It was KILLER. Aside from that, it was all pretty average.I saw another review say that Phat Jacks is \"Lincoln good\", which is about the best possible explanation of this place (and a lot of other places in Lincoln) that I've seen. Folks around Lincoln just don't seem to have much of a reference point for food. That's a pretentious and condescending thing to say but....it's just the reality. There are so many places that people rave about that are just average. You don't know what you don't know Lincoln! What do we of Lincoln know that ONLY we of Lincoln know? In other words, what do you know about your city if it's the only city you know? Travel a little! Some of the best BBQ in the country is all of 2 hours down the interstate! Go to KC and try Arthur Bryant's, Oklahoma Joes, Fiorellas, etc and THEN tell me I should wait in line to get burnt ends from Phat Jacks.Maybe it's unfair to compare to KC, but that's the plane that a lot of people put this place on. I'm excited to see if the new Oklahoma Joe's can pull it off here, as their stuff in Kansas City is some of the best BBQ I've ever eaten. I think Anthony Bourdain even ranked it as a top 10 place he'd eat before he died. Hopefully it will give Lincoln some desperately needed perspective."}, {"review_id": "0fM0lpgaXxrWLFI7s7fzMA", "user_id": "hHVjxcJ4LftU5PLLAWgsSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "What we had was awesome.  What we wanted wasnt ready at 2pm on  Friday.

All of their food is phenomenal but the Burnt Ends are my absolute favorite. The staff have been so nice every single time I've been in there and their new location is very clean and spacious. Not one bad thing to say about this place except that I wish they'd go back to their old cornbread instead of the muffins they have now.

Got the kids' meal, which was plenty huge (ribs + pulled pork or brisket, 2 sides), swapped in burnt ends for $1. Loved the ribs, burnt ends were well-smoked and flavorful, but a bit dry. Get the spicy BBQ sauce! Warm, friendly staff, fast service and ample seating. Sides don't disappoint - yummy cole slaw, potato salad, Texas toast. Definitely couldn't finish it all, but ribs were delicious!"}, {"review_id": "nR_CzxkA0s518LVAe8nOnw", "user_id": "xZmFY7rN42CWBaswM-uzwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "To be honest, Phat Jack is top one BBQ in Lincoln!

Most okay, but some really good--I was skeptical. This though lived up to the hype from the locals. The awards on the wall are well deserved. The burnt ends may be the best I've had anywhere and certainly were the best I've had in years. Better than anything in omaha. The beans were good the cornbread was good too.

Plus it's only open till 8 on weekends, 7 weekdays. The service was friendly and fast, we got our food within about 10 minutes of our order. The only criticism I had was that the Wi-Fi was awful. Complete dead zone. Everything on the menu looked tempting. We had the burnt ends for dinner. We thought they were just good as something you'd get in KC.  The baked bean were also delicious.

The nachos were covered in nasty fake cheese--like a mound of Cheez-Whiz dumped on top, followed by a mound of sour cream. We planned ahead & read the menu because we had a vegetarian joining us & they had veggie nachos on the menu. Those of us eating meat wouldn't have touched those if you put meat on them!If you're going to offer veggie nachos, at least put real cheese on them. There wasn't even lettuce on them. When we visited with the manager, she didn't even comp the item even though none of us ate them. We paid a good amount for lunch--purchasing several meals. The Mac & cheese also is full of fake cheese.
