We ordered the vegetable pizza which was great! Cheese was delicious and perfectly tart with the sweet roasted vegetables. While chowing on our slice of heaven we noticed the music was bumpin. There was an awesome soundtrack playing in the background had to get the name of it. We tracked down the man in charge (of the music that is) who was hilarious and hooked us up with his sounds. Full and satisfied we stepped outside to check out the vibe. It was a Saturday night and they were featuring a band. The yard is beautiful with a bar at the end and servers walking around to take your order. In the middle of the space is a large tree with lights chairs scattered around and plenty of hammocks on the side. It was a chill spot, everyone was very nice and service was great!A good time indeed!"}, {"review_id": "Jk0pMq6t5JWDfxL9i0B9NQ", "user_id": "fShXOnCc_qnmX5BEk_8LNg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "It's so cool that this place is just across the yard from Axlerad. You can feed your need for grub and you throw a couple back. Nice! The inside of this place is small, but large enough to do what it sets out to accomplish....take your order and get you fed. It is pretty darned busy! The people behind the counter seem quite welcoming and nice and made ordering a breeze. We ordered pizza slices (one each; a hamburger and a veggie) and it took the same 30 minutes it would take for a typical pizza. That seems to be par for the course, right? OK. So, the pizza was good (not mind blowing) and almost as big as other places. The only thing that really burned my britches, was the fact that half of the crust edge of my slice was pretty burnt. From the photos of the oven, they weren't made in a brick oven, so the burnt edge is a No-No! No for character or to give it a certain taste. No-No!We'll be back to give this place another shot."}, {"review_id": "GFfchh_rsIOagfGnHrg_tQ", "user_id": "4X9XgtreY-PV-SoAm5AaGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm a pizza snob.  This place is aces.  Best za in h-town.  I'll fight anyone who challenges this (Joking but seriously)Still great pizza.  Gah, cheese or pepperoni are the absolute best.  Love it.Still the best."}, {"review_id": "qLSck3bZKQbcBqW7qXsImA", "user_id": "3MFsNsX9O91Q1d8gHiZrtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Pizza hands down amazing!

Plus it's next door to Axelrad. You know when all else fails you, pizza and beer saves you. Who needs abs? Have you had pizza and beer?? Pizza is the way to go, I have ventured on to the calzone and the pasta as well. All extremely filling but Pizza is life.  My friends take a potty break and when they return:\"I ate all the pizza, and drank all the beer.\" no shame. not even kidding.They deliver to Axelrad, that's probably my favorite option. A cool colorful mural on the side of the building, perfect back drop for a selfie.

We know that. He was the one who rescued Princess Toadstool. It was his picture on the side of the plumbing van. He was the loud one. The proud one. The smelly one.So whatever happened to Luigi? You know, the cute, quiet, unassuming one in the background? The one you secretly wanted to date but you knew that your sister Eliza was a better match for him because you're the oldest and wittiest and New York Citiest?Well I'll tell you what happened to him. He opened a damn pizza place is what happened to him. In freaking Houston is what happened to him. And it's the best one in town by a mile is what happened to him. Boom.(is what happened to him)Luigi's is unequivocally the best pizza slice - by far - that I've had in Houston, but there is an extremely long wait for slices most evenings. When I say this slice would hold its own anywhere - Buffalo, Detroit, Chicago, even New York City - I cannot give a higher compliment. However, stay away from the (ew) Gelato.Came here to figure out who I would someday marry. Should have gone to Louiga Board's.As someone who lives in Buffalo (the mecca of family owned pizzerias) and has had plenty of pizza in Detroit and Chicago and New York (the other three great cities for pizza), it's hard for me to ever be impressed by any pizza outside that region and those cities. I've tried most of the highly-rated slices in the Houston area and they were either awful or mediocre. Except for this one, which I think is actually really good.Came here to meet Lucille Ball. Should have gone to \"I Love Lucy's.\" But I do love Luigi's.A lot of people that will tell you there are other great slices in the region, but in my experience, they are not experts and they're judging by Houston standards. I can't judge by Houston standards because I've had too many amazing pizzas elsewhere.Came here to buy a toboggan. Should have gone to \"Luges.\"This is definitively the only one of the top slices in Houston (I use the word top quite liberally) that could stand up to the levels of excellence in the Great Lakes in northeastern cities. I could eat these slices all day. Except then I'd get fat. And write more Yelp reviews. Oh wait maybe I should.Came here to buy a toilet brush. Should have gone to Loo-Squeegees.The gelato is pretty awful here and they shouldn't even bother serving it to be honest. And as for the wait time - well the service can be okay but waiting this long for a slice of pizza gets really old. It's one of the reasons I only get slices here once a month instead of once a week. At least there are a lot of cute partying people (because it basically shares its outdoor space with Axelrad) to check out especially if you sit outside, especially at weekends.Came here looking for extremely promiscuous gay men. Should have gone to \"Loose Queenies.\""}, {"review_id": "OFZTPRwhWO_IDK68RzpvQQ", "user_id": "i6w1V5iPWdYKVPnZLOeLkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "For about $20 you can have a large pizza with just about any toppings brought over to you while you day drink at Axelrad.  Pretty cool huh?  The pizza is actually pretty good too!  The onion rings were also bomb diggity.  The wings were ok, but that was because I ordered the wrong ones.  And I'd say you could skip the garlic bread.  All in all, a great treat to accompany your cocktail in the awesome Axelrad patio!  What's not to like?"}, {"review_id": "kL8EZ1G14niY8FswD5uPWA", "user_id": "UOpqm-G9Nqhv1Ifc_btmdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "One of the best pizzas in Houston.

Located right next to Axelrad, they've got a good symbiotic relationship going on. The Caprese pizza is probably my all time favorite here. Nice, thin crust, really high quality toppings, and just that bit of burnt edge to go along with the sweetness of the sauce. Recently tried some of their other concoctions, such as the Mexicana which pretty much has an entire steak on top of the pizza.There are just a couple of gripes. When it's busy, they don't seem to cut the pizza well enough, and it's hard to get a nice even slice out. What do I mean by this? When I pull a slice of pizza, all of the cheese and toppings slide off and not attached to the slice. This has happened on multiple occasions, and it's not a dealbreaker, but it is pretty dang annoying.The other thing is that they have a weird delivery system. They don't deliver themselves, they go through postmates or grubhub. Maybe it's forward thinking, but I still prefer that the pizzeria have their own delivery system so I don't have to go through the hassle of going on an app, waiting for them to confirm delivery, and all of that. It just seems more complicated than it need be."}, {"review_id": "2WsBQMbE3nVxzf-kCdWdxQ", "user_id": "fuyPw1fazLW0zh2MXgeaxw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "I've come here a few times and it's always good!
