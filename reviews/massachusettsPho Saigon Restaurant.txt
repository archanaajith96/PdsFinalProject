I was craving for some noodles and came here. But I had to wait for my friend who was 1.5/2 hours away. They were super accommodating and let me wait for her. I can't thank them enough for that. Now about the food, I ordered Bún bò Hu which was very good. Perfect amount of lemon grass and spices and noodles were perfect too. It's comparable to some of the best places in NYC. It was so good that we had 3 bowls among me and my friend (embarrassing, I know!). I highly recommend this place to anyone in Springfield."}, {"review_id": "vyua9NtjYrrm5DfwKgD__g", "user_id": "7h_f5EEbIa0x-iE2Y8eTpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Lots of authentic food choices.

It's got good vibes, great food, and consistently delivers on savory, flavorful deliciousness. Pho Saigon is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Springfield because it's consistent, and what I mean is that you can rely on good, affordable food: every time you visit. I've eaten here on countless occasions now, and each and every time they've proven to be home runs. You can get a large bowl of Pho for $8. That's insane. A fulfilling meal for $8 that's legit & authentic? Come on, you can't beat that. And the service here is just lovely. They're attentive and always appreciative. Do yourself a solid favor and give this place a shot. You won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "nwtmdWB0nL2D0k1EWhE2Pg", "user_id": "8D5G1K6w4DPvEpZB9Aoszw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2017", "text": "Had the pleasure of a road trip up to Springfield with fellow Yelpers Dan C and Thien N. Thien was our tour guide for some great Vietnamese food . Springfield has a good market of Vietnamese food and Dan and I were eager to try it. It's definitely worth the 20 min ride from the Hartford area. Pho Saigon is a nice sit down full service restaurant. We all wanted to get a bowl of delicious Pho to enjoy. I have to admit I was a little hesitant to \" cheat \" on my favorite CT Pho spot , but was so glad I did . Pho Saigon pho is just as good if not better than my usual spot. The first thing I noticed was I was able to pick up on the spice mixes of coriander, star anise , cloves and what ever else traditionally flavors the broth . It was served piping hot and as always I sampled the broth before adding of the usual toppings. It was perfect. I ordered the grilled pork , shrimp and egg roll with lettuce and bean sprouts served over vermicelli. This dish having the vermicelli noodles with the added fish sauce and sriracha sauce was awesome. It was filling but still light. I also tried Dans dish a pork chop rice plate. It was well cooked delicious tasting piece of pork. Both these dishes were Thien suggestion and were spot on. We will definitely return and try some new dishes soon. There is also a Banh Mi place next door and part of our plan was to sample that too on our Vietnamese food fest road trip, but they are closed on Tuesday. So off we went to Hartford in search of the Bahn mi ."}, {"review_id": "rNfEWD0F4hd0D4zLk8SaWw", "user_id": "iNXI0m-tFxPmOn539s_HQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "Love these place for food but wouldn't recommend for Thai tea.

I got the Pho Ga and my friend got the one with the well-done steak (can't remember the name at the moment!). We started off with the lemon marinated grilled chicken, which was amazing. I'm usually not a fan of lemon or citrus flavors, but the flavor was so subtle and fresh. I could have just eaten that and been satisfied.My phone was incredible. I couldn't even finish the whole thing and I got a small. Our waiter brought out a plate with fresh bean sprouts and basil and I tore a bunch of basil and put it in the soup. Best thing ever. The flavors are amazing! The meats are perfectly cooked, and the broth is perfection too.Can't wait to come back soon!"}, {"review_id": "FIdq9Bk_RXfpDfYYfacKSQ", "user_id": "pMEl35ycRC5bhYyzN3C1Qw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/20/2017", "text": "Found this place when I was heading to a different restaurant and decided to stop and try the pho. The parking is a little awkward due to the road construction, but there is a lot at the end of the building that is very close to the restaurant. From the outside it looks ok, but once inside the decor is fine. Ordered the #13 large, the broth was flavorful and very tasty.

I stop here often, we eat in, and we order to go. I'm always happy. My favorite thing is the fresh rolls, with a delicious peanut dipping sauce. I get them as my appetizer. They are full of flavor and I always want to order more but my stomach can't fit it all. Than I get chicken pho soup. It's crazy how good this soup taste. It has fresh flavors, the broth, the basil and cilantro just to name a few.My husband always gets the same thing, the spring roll as an appetizer and curry chicken as his meal. There curry is not like most, I'm not a fan of curry but I always steal a bite from him.Ive sampled a few other things...and I'm never disappointed.

A cozy little restaurant that offers takeout as well. While I didn't stay in to eat, the interaction with the staff was excellent. The male waiter know the menu inside and out was extremely pleasant - even while he had many other customers to serve. I ordered two different curry meals and they were absolutely divine.

We've even brought my mom and our kids, they all loved it. Our 3 year old finished a large bowl by himself lol and our 4 year old is still asking for the fried egg rolls. Every time we've been back the servers great us warmly. It's nice that they're not just there to take orders and bring out food, but that they're interested in building a lasting relationship with their dining guests. A truly wonderful mom and pops restaurant that has quickly become one of our favorites. -----My boyfriend and I got an unexpected date night when my mom decided to take our kids shopping. He wanted pho, and usually we head to Pho Boston in W. Hartford CT, but didn't feel like trekking all that way from Enfield last night. Thankfully we found Pho Saigon on Yelp and had a delightful dinner. Unlike the bustling atmosphere of Pho Boston, Pho Saigon is the friendly, warm, and cozy establishment my boyfriend and I enjoy frequenting more often. Food was delicious (the fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce was a little bland for my taste, but everything else was fantastic), place has a great atmosphere with friendly and attentive servers. Take Out orders were also in full swing. I'm sure we'll be back."}, {"review_id": "9cGEhYMciYMHvnFddS4dxQ", "user_id": "yUf8AhZvdPjE1s33lbgcEA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/11/2016", "text": "Great portions..great food!I ordered the beef onion skewers appetizer, and the sweet and sour shrimp entree.The beef was so flavorful and tender...I highly recommend! The sweet and sour shrimp came with approximately 6 or 7 LARGE shrimp perfectly fried in a tempura batter, with the sweet n sour sauce served on the side. I believe they served it like this cause our food was take out. Both dishes very filling and satisfying.The place itself was clean but a little tight on space. I also enjoyed the pineapple smoothie which was well blended and balanced throughout (not too sweet). However, i was eager to try the soursop flavor, but they were \"out\" of it...which I think meant they no longer carry the flavor because the soursop fruit is very hard to get in the US. You may find the frozen preservative in an international market, but people are not as familiar with the fruit to go out of their way to buy it.Overall, good eats..I look forward to trying Vietnamese food again once I return to Maryland."}, {"review_id": "DRR8XzDTIG4WWCsHzCWQHg", "user_id": "7O-isQNNwCqKduuzEv0T1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2017", "text": "Nice place, just passing by coming back to NY from a snowboarding trip in Vermont.  A hot bowl of Pho always hits the spot.Hot, giant bowls.  Good soup flavor, and fresh meat.  Can't go wrong here.  Summer rolls were pretty good as an appetizer too."}, {"review_id": "qlYYTE-a2jiTlnrZ6Min0Q", "user_id": "mhc43PVg_FbzJIomIg717g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2016", "text": "I've been frequenting this Vietnamese restaurant for 16 years.

Next, squeeze on some lime and add your favoured condiments and garnishes. Mix with chopsticks and a spoon. Pile the ingredients onto your spoon and slurp away, bringing the bowl to your mouth and drinking every last sop of broth. You can go without most of the garnishes but using the right noodles is very important. Laced with the warm fragrant spices of star anise, coriander seeds, cinnamon and cloves -- with top notes of fresh herbs, onions and citrus and brimming with noodles, every mouthful feels nourishing to the body and mind. For me, pho is about home, wherever that may be. I constantly crave it, especially when I'm away from my family. Pho Saigon manages to hit all the right notes when I'm craving. In this particular part of Springfield, there's certainly no shortage of Vietnamese restaurants. But the always friendly and informative staff, a medley of Vietnamese dishes available, and overall experience has me coming back. I haven't had a dish that didn't remind me of Mom. Starters, vermicelli, noodle and rice dishes, everything is tastefully prepared. Smoothies aren't bad and overall pricing is reasonable. Closed Wednesday's and open until 9pm most nights, Pho Saigon is one of my top choices when I'm craving good Vietnamese."}, {"review_id": "uIZNrhA788o3hbhGKtdOjw", "user_id": "FwkNpN3KLp0WWKxuL_oEcQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2016", "text": "I stopped in here with my fiancee while on our road trip to Ludlow Vermont this past weekend.  I'll say this I've never been disappointed with a large bowl of Pho soup.This Pho shop like almost every other one I've been to all seem to have the same taste in table selection and chairs which I always find amusing.  (My fiancee tells me it's because cleaning a glass surface is much more efficient)  But none the less I have never go to a Pho place for the place mats or table decor but rather the yummy food.We ordered a spring roll appetizer to share since they sell them as a two piece item.  I enjoy these apps very much, especially the peanut butter dipping sauce.  For the main meal I ordered an extra large bowl of regular Pho soup with meat while my fiancee ordered a spicy vegetarian Pho soup.  The waiter of course asked if I was sure about the size to which I was positive.  We then waited about 8 minutes before receiving our food.What I found interesting about this place unlike any other Pho shop I've been too is the fact that a bell rang signifying the food was ready.Overall the food was extremely good and very yummy.  I easily finished the extra large bowl, which impressed both the chef and the waiter.  If I lived in the area I would definitely frequent this establishment on a weekly basis."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-saigon-restaurant-springfield?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
