For example;I am from Texas. I moved up here around 15 years ago. Most Texans want their food to have a lot of flavor, a good amount of spice, and some, to a lot of heat. Here in Idaho, most tend to like their food more on the bland side. With little to no spice, and little to no heat. A case in point is my wife. She is a native Idahoan.Her idea of hot sauce is ketchup. I have this same problem at home when cooking. I am the primary cook in the home. The problem is that I like spice and heat and I am cooking for 2 ladies (my wife for now, and my daughter). Neither like anything even remotely spicy.  Now, I want to cook for that they will like, but when I taste my cooking, what seems very mind to me, is very spicy to them. Ugh!Of course like most anything else in life, there are exceptions, but this is a general guideline. So going forward, when writing reviews, I will do my best to give food 2 ratings. One for spice lovers of the world, like me, and one for the......less spice lovers out there.Before I went to Mi Casa to eat lunch, I read the reviews. This place has a lot of people that seem to just love the food here.In addition to the food, I want to eat in nice surroundings. Now, I dont consider myself a food snob, but there are certain things that bug me. When I walked into Mi Casa, the 1st thing I did is look around. In the words of Shania Twain, \"that dont impress me much!\"There are exposed electrical panels, the bathroom is right there in plain view, and there was some sort of odd looking picket fence thing in the corner. I don't know about you, but when I am eating my food, the last thing I want to see is some guy, or gal, going into the bathroom. Yukaronney, or double Yukarooney, depending on if they are going there to do #1 or #2.We started our meal with the normal chips and salsa and refrieds. The Chips were...well they were chips. The salsa was ok. No heat to it and very little flavor either, but it was fine. The refrieds were pretty bland. They could have been anything at all. Thats how flavorful they were.I ordered en enchilada with shredded beef and a Chimichanga (Hamburger meat). My 13 year old daughter had a chicken taco. The shredded beef Enchilada was tasty. I was impressed by this one. No heat, but it had some spice to it.The Chimichanga, on the other hand, had no flavor what-so-ever. I even added the sour cream and Guac that came with it hoping that this would add flavor. But nope. No flavor at all. The flavor machine had left the building.Next I tried my daughters chicken tacos. OMG is all I can say to these. I have served better tasting chicken to my dog. Even my daughter, that loves chicken, turned her nose up to these. So the bottom line here is that it will depend on where you are from if you will like the food here. If you like your food more on the flavorless side of things, you might love it here.If you like spice, heat, and flavor, I suggest that you keep looking. If anyone out there finds a good Mexican restaurant that serves good, flavorful, full of spice and heat food, please let me know. I have been searching for this 15 years.Ratings 1-10 scale (1 being \"Yukamunga\" and 10 being a \"foodgasm\")Ambience - 1Food (Spice lovers of the World) - 2Food - (The Spice less population ) - 5In the words of U2, I still have not found what I am searching for."}, {"review_id": "2dech5bfu1yzOFp8_sFXjg", "user_id": "2511PkQ_1r0KqlDYFDX9gA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Service was great and even though it was 6:30 p.m. on a Friday night we were able to get in right away.

After our first great experience, we decided we needed another go. The service was just as overly friendly and very attentive. They do not let you want for anything here.We tried the Queso Fundido - very good, the chorizo was a touch on the dry side but nothing to really complain about, we had no problems polishing it off.My husband had the same as he did last time, crab enchilada - he reported it was just as good. I tried another new (to me) item, the sopes w/ chile colorado. They were good but I felt missed the mark on flavor - the chile colorado is like stewed beef chunks in a red sauce. The sauce definitely could've used some tweaking in terms of flavor. The beef was very tender.The sope itself was also a bit boring. I realize it is just the vehicle but I feel it could have benefited from some additional flavor. The texture is a bit strange, it's kind of like a really dense biscuit that has been flattened out.Left me wishing I had ordered the mole! Oh well. Next time.Even though my slight disappointment in what I believe is more personal preference than anything, we will most definitely be returning!"}, {"review_id": "VAwnHMSzJ9tTL9K2-EWfGw", "user_id": "N1-w713xEzuM3i8dhrS53Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Best food we've had in a long time.

Been trying to get here for a while and finally did around 6 PM on a Monday night. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time and promptly got our drink orders taken and menus, followed shortly by chips, salsa and beans. Beans had shredded cheddar on top. Take Michele R's advice on the extra spoon and napkin request. You do read her reviews before you try a place, right? Everything we had in our party of four was awesome. My burrito was as big as my arm and packed full of goodness. Enchiladas were stuffed. Chile relleno was huge and packed full of cheese. Tacos were legit street style with cilantro and onion on top. Portion sizes seem to be on the giant side. We took food home with us. The only thing that lacked was it took a while for our food order to get taken. This was NOT due to the fact that the servers were standing around doing nothing. They were running around the whole time. However, they kept our chips and drinks full, so we were happy. Food took a bit of time to come out, but hopefully that meant it wasn't all microwaved. It sure did NOT taste that way!  Everything seemed fresh made. Give them a shot and bring your friends and appetites. We'll be back for sure. Get yourself that spoon and extra napkins!"}, {"review_id": "vhLGLOsj85NYKnCtvbBKdA", "user_id": "ifLv6QH1cokzVbWbbi4bbw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Finally!!!!!! Someone in Boise understands what authentic fajitas taste like! We ordered fajitas to go,  and honestly,  I wasn't expecting much because NO ONE in Boise gets it.  This place gets it! The meat is actually marinated and has flavor.  The onions and peppers are cooked to caramelized perfection.  They know that mushrooms have NO place in a fajita.  What a concept.  The tortillas taste hand made and are very fresh.  The salsa is not just tomato juice with an onion floating around in it.  It has a wonderful flavor.  After trying literally every Mexican restaurant in Boise,  this is the only place that will have my business from now on.  Very impressed with Mi Casa!"}, {"review_id": "Dbvdn8IEm-wJnqFlRMzLMg", "user_id": "E7XhAnGEfHz7VtknGQdsYA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "The food was one star, the two is because the waiter was nice.

Chips looked and tasted like they came from a bag and were stuck under a heat lamp.Allergy alert! If you're reading my reviews you know I take into account allergy issues - especially gluten issues - in my reviews.I don't often have issues with gluten in Mexican restaurants; however, in this case I was surprised to find out there is wheat flour in both the red enchilada sauce AND the chicken used for the enchiladas. So even if you order chicken enchiladas with corn tortillas instead of flour (as I occasionally do) you can still get glutened. Anyway, I am glad I asked in advance and was able to avoid.What to do?: Ask for the \"veggie\" sauce (which apparently contains no gluten but tastes vaguely of hot dogs) instead and substitute the chicken for a different meat. If you're dying for something with chicken you can go for one of the pollo dishes but be sure to specify the gluten free veggie sauce on anything. Reminder: Always confirm there is not wheat or gluten (or whatever your allergen is ) in a dish with your server.Anyway, aside from turning my enchspectations (enchilada expectations) upside down, this place is small but has a good clean look to it. They are open on Sundays which is cool for an after-church brunch/lunch option.My husband with no allergies tried the mole and thought it was okay, but not as great as others he has tried. Note, I have been here 3 times. I really wanted to like this place. Maybe I will try other menu items? Probably not, the threat of being glutened looms near here. The search for our favorite Mexican restaurant continues...."}, {"review_id": "kXz7_S27gZWYZen_zCYV7Q", "user_id": "n0n7-5kZadWJZgAlYVW3Bw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "I really enjoy this place.

I got to try some of their dishes and I thought everyone was worth ordering again. I think they use high quality meats and ingredients at this place and it's noticeable.
