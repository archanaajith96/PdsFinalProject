Still #1 in the West Suburbs IMHO!"}, {"review_id": "7FCL5zg5pVY3bLLA1JiE1Q", "user_id": "as_D75LlyJj-RvE_zsYjAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/10/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I am updating and upgrading my review of Momoya from 2-stars to 4-stars.After a lack-luster experience at Rotary Sushi Bar (Aurora) and thoroughly disgusting experience at Sushi by OISI (Plainfield), I decided to give Momoya a third try. I am happy to say that the quality of food has improved remarkedly. Not sure if it was a different sushi chef on my third visit, or if the first two visits were just off-days for the chef. I ordered my usual Spicy Tuna and I believe the other was the Jenny roll (with shrimp tempura). The Spicy Tuna mix is still good, with just the right amount of spicyness. This time the shrimp tempura was hot out of fryer. And the rice for both rolls was a much more pleasing room temperature (previous visits the rice was refrigerator cold).I was so impressed by the improvement on my third visit, that I went back a fourth time. Looks like Momoya will be my go-to sushi restaurant for the time being (as in, while I live nearby). Plus, they have some discount on certain days/times.

It tastes sweet when you first bite into it and then it had this amazing slow burn. It is so good!On my visit, I had the Momoya (lunch) Special 2, which was a California roll, a spicy tuna roll, and a shrimp tempura roll. It came with miso soup and salad. I have to admit, the salad dressing looked chunky and gross. But it was so so good!The California roll was your average California roll. See above re the super awesome spicy shrimp roll. The shrimp tempura was above average; the taste and consistency was just right. The waitress was very sweet and attentive. A few things to note: If you want silverware, rather than chopsticks, you will need to ask. There was only one 'specialty' roll ($17!!). The waitress said they only add specialty rolls to the menu if they run a special and it is really popular with the customers."}, {"review_id": "LnWseNmO93_0soSl9kuLZw", "user_id": "-rw9_TTO1XN4qD6-ex8yCw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2016", "text": "family style restaurant with a small and simple menufood is authentic and the sashimi is fresh and the price is reasonable, udon broth is a bit on the salty side and too much batter on the tempurathe service is good, the waitress is very polite and humble"}, {"review_id": "fEA3kkiy-1FEY5sGLPWF4A", "user_id": "ksNePHkIp8P9pY6-N7BPgA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/26/2017", "text": "I'm not sure how this place, or many other sushi places in the Naperville / Aurora area gets 4 stars.Freshness: None of the fish tasted off or old, all pretty fresh. This is the only reason I gave them 3 stars instead of 2 stars.Service: There was only one server for the entire place, she was hurried and didn't have much opportunity to do much more than take our orders and deliver the food. I don't blame her, I think she was doing the best she could, but when your spending over $100 on dinner for 4, you expect for the server to have time to check on your table at least one or two times during your visit.Sushi: The sushi itself was mediocre at best. I've had grocery store sushi that was more impressive.- Nigiri: The pieces weren't tiny, but were on the smaller side. The rice for the nigiri was about the size of a piece of bubbalicious gum (roughly 1\"x.5\"x.5\") which is next to nothing, we might as well have ordered sashimi. This is a deceptive trick used to make the piece of fish look bigger.- Rolls: We didn't get a large sampling (thankfully), but we did try the the Spicy Tuna, Negi Hamachi, Philadelphia, and Dynamite B. -- The Spicy in the Spicy Tuna wasn't well balanced, it overpowered to fish leaving you unable to taste any Tuna. I've seen this before, sushi places will add  extra Spicy to older tuna to get rid of it while masking any fishy flavor.-- The Negi Hamachi was ground instead of pieces, which is the less desirable form. Instead of Negi (green onion) they added ginger, this roll wasn't totally horrible but it wasn't good, especially when your expecting Negi. -- Dynamite B was over cooked and barely had any fish.-- Philadelphia was okay, I would order it again if I ever planned on stepping foot in their restaurant again, just because I knew it was satisfactory not because it stood out.The Menu:They have other Japanese options on the menu that were tempting to try, such as some of my favorites like Sukiyaki and Yaki Tori. But I decided to skip those when I noticed they boil the Yaki Tori. Hopefully that's a typo, as they meant broiled, but I honestly didn't want to take the chance by."}, {"review_id": "sYIO6P18cPRPqw0q86-sBw", "user_id": "fgRJNM5gJT26Vq22MmkNVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/6/2016", "text": "Momoya was my first sushi experience (about 10 years ago) and it's still my favorite after trying dozens of sushi joints since then.Everything is totally fresh and it's always a nice surprise to see what they do with the presentation. The spicy tuna is actually spicy, unlike some places. The best specialty roll is the Crunch (IMO). Miso soup is a simple, but yummy treat, too (I get a bowl every time we go).Somehow, this place is never busy--even if you go on a Saturday night. I don't get it!

My only experience with Momoya has been ordering take out, so I honestly didn't get the FULL experience of the restaurant. With that being said, here goes...Momoya is pretty close to my house and I drive by it almost every day. As a sushi lover I of course was curious as to what this place had to offer! The hubs and I had a taste for sushi, but didn't quite have the time to sit down somewhere, so I popped in on my way home from work and placed an order to go. I sat up at the bar and was immediately greeted by a waitress. She was very helpful! Asked if I had questions, made suggestions, etc. My biggest concern was not knowing how much food to get for two of us, so she helped me out with that as well. My order was put in right away and I was offered a beverage while I waited. It felt like such a quick wait because I was so entertained being able to sit right up at the sushi bar and watch the chef make our rolls! It only took about 10 minutes and I was on my way to winning the best wife ever award for bringing home this delicious meal.This is what we enjoyed:- Edamame- Miso Soup- Spider Roll- Spicy Tuna Maki- Dragon Special Maki- Caterpillar Special MakiAll of it was awesome!! Simple as that. Our only complaints:We felt it was a tad pricey for what we got. I mean, it was very good - but I think we dropped around $50 for this little take out dinner. Also, the rolls that contained a lot of eel weren't our fave. I'm not sure if it was the ingredients or just our own personal taste buds, but the Dragon roll wasn't our fave.Regardless, we live near by and will probably be giving this restaurant another try (hopefully maybe during a happy hour or when a good special is going on)!"}, {"review_id": "-_LIOTyYQ5AZ9CdfLC4nJw", "user_id": "lzHMyYq3cfDAY3vHC-uC9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/27/2016", "text": "This was delightful on quite a few different levels: a much needed dose of Zen, excellent unhurried and attentive service and well made maki rolls.  That being said, my first choice is really sashimi, but I have to test the waters with maki...a return visit for sashimi could swell my opinion.  I headed over here on a Monday evening, having been disenchanted with a local \"sushi 1/2 price special,\" at another local spot.  Momoya had been in my cross hairs before and I welcomed the bonus of a tranquil and welcoming space as opposed to that frenetic \"sushi special\" mob.  This is what we love about the land of the rising sun.  It's far from elaborate but the tone and quality is pure pleasure.  The soft shell crab appetizer is a must, and shareable.  I loved The Crunch, and I do love that about most of the rolls I had, crunch!  They do them well.  They have a full bar, but we stuck to sake.  Well worth a trip.n"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/momoya-japanese-restaurant-aurora?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
