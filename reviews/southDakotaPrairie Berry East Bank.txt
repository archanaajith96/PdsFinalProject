My husband and I enjoyed phenomenal food and drinks as well as excellent service! We think about our evening here often. We want to go back to Sioux Falls just to come back to Prairie Berry. We split a soft pretzel, mango chicken salad, and a charcuterie plate. I'm salivating just thinking of the food. If you're in the area or just passing through like we were, this is an excellent place to relax and enjoy a  beautiful local spot."}, {"review_id": "PvwhDr0sDjISGnNxko_L5A", "user_id": "dTl-jk5OojEeKC-rSgTWrQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "This could have easily been a 4 or 5 star experience for us. Our salad was wonderful but our Brown rice dish was lacking. The menu stated and yelp pictures presented this dish with brown rice and a few vegetables. As you will see in the picture the dish came out with white rice and not very many vegetables. For a $14 dish we expected more. We felt as if we received what was left in the kitchen on this one due to the fact that they closed the kitchen after making our dishes.We notified the waitress about the error and was given literally \"I feel ya\" and then walked away. This left us a bit flabbergasted. We were hungry so we ate all of it. It was good, just not quite what we ordered. If she would have reacted differently with anything that resembled caring, our experience could have been much different.Would give this place another shot based on reviews but there are so many other great restaurants and breweries to visit."}, {"review_id": "jFyVzzmz4jsS8CZxm7k1RQ", "user_id": "IwwrWxq0puP4wA5cF8Yesg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "What a great place for lunch and conversation. The menu has so many awesome choices and healthy ones. We decided to go with the Epicurious menu so that we could try many items. We had smoked duck breast, buffalo salami, cheese curds...they were amazing!! Plus Swiss cheese that was so creamy and full of deliciousness. We also had a hummus platter that included roasted artichokes and root vegetables. These platters didn't disappoint. We enjoyed several bottles of there dry sparkling waters, Blood orange, Lavendar and juniper berry! So refreshing.Now this place is not where you're going to have service such as a waitress. You place your order at the bar and anytime you would like more than you go up and order. The ambiance and decor all work together to make a great spot for lunch or dinner!!"}, {"review_id": "iXBMdBh1ui3WDIGyodtA5w", "user_id": "oIi72YJvLErqvbxM4ufTow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "Great place!  I had a really tasty ginger steak and brown rice bowl.  It can be difficult to find healthy options but this fit the bill!I also bought two bottles of wine to take home.  If I lived closer I would be here all the time."}, {"review_id": "1-SG2IpJS3exCy42jXqvgA", "user_id": "Ri4zt48PvIchv9FD_a7wLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/11/2017", "text": "Came here for some drinks and a bite to eat early on a Friday night.

Traveling on business and was drawn to this place for a glass of wine and a Wednesday event inviting canine companions. I was slightly disappointed that the kale salad was a lunch only item. I enjoyed a flight of dry whites and a charcuterie plate. The menu of meats and cheese were well chosen and ample. Brie, Gouda, saucisson, salami, prosciutto, marinated veggies, olives, gluten free crackers. Being from out of town and a new patron the staff were helpful and knowledgeable with guidance. If I lived here, this place would be on my rotation not only for dine-in but for picnics and gifts too."}, {"review_id": "a8to4jE0DF6oA72igSihpQ", "user_id": "yQy4EuUqUFREzS5rk8pqCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "This place is sooo good.

The atmosphere when walking in, especially on a sunny day with the sun shining brightly into the numerous large windows, is something to behold. You immediately feel like you've discovered something special. My wife is obsessed with their monthly bingo as we've gone to nearly every one of them since it started. It's a free will donation in which they donate to various charities. Finding a spot can prove to be a challenge as we've arrived an hour early today to end up in our usual spot in the hallway. At this point my review is lacking details in regard to what matters most -- the food and beverage. All I can say is come check it out, it's a little pricy, but the quality justifies the cost. There is so much to explore here that you sincerely have to see...and taste for yourself. Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "4W_X2QERhPn9_iaxXL3e_g", "user_id": "j-E6-6-TpWVPUXbx_rRrrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/19/2017", "text": "Thoroughly enjoyed an afternoon here.

We were greeted with a welcoming \"Hey,guys!\" as we entered the restaurant. Very cool atmosphere, but limited seating and our table had a nasty wobble. There is a nice selection of sandwiches, salads and entrees to choose from. They offer an extensive wine menu, but none at all detailing their beer selection. They were fairly busy, but food orders seemed to take longer to come out than they should have. My husband had the Beer Braised Pork Flat-Grill Sandwich and Butternut Squash soup and I had the Sesame Ginger Steak Brown Rice Bowl. The soup wasn't very hot at all and had only a couple pieces of sausage in it. As a whole, they really skimped on the proteins. Food was quite  good with innovative combinations, but definitely \"lady sized\" portions. I would really like to come back and sample their beer and wines and a few other items from their menu."}, {"review_id": "B8N4XB4xsCmYS1l6Ci0hKw", "user_id": "ciYOsNx4tHGE9KSC7us3vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/19/2017", "text": "First time here while traveling.

My friends and I also participated in the 1k beer run which we will HANDS DOWN participate in again. Prairie Berry has a delicious IPA and their wines are pretty good, but most are pretty sweet. The last time I ordered a cheese plate, they were out of the big eds gouda (which is one of my favs) but I ended up finding a chunk in their refrigerated section you can buy from, and they ended up cutting it all up for me which was nice. Everything from the smoked duck breast, to the selection of cheeses, to the beers ad wines, is all good. Check this place out and you wont be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "RGc70qI_KmnH3bDp13mo7Q", "user_id": "tSRwg1iT9LwDM64rTTnuIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/16/2017", "text": "We stayed in Sioux Falls while enroute​ to Seattle and were looking for some good food and brews. The Mango Chicken rice bowl was delicious, the sauce had just the right amount of kick. Their Picannte Notte pizza had a chunky sauce of diced tomatoes and green chiles which was just the spicy pizza I wanted. The Dr. Valentine beer was outstanding as well, a nice maltly flavor on the front followed by just the right amount of bitterness."}, {"review_id": "B_jCYmFrSSN0S5kvrAqEVg", "user_id": "_kzo9x4q5hzefx8VZoX0yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2017", "text": "Adorable interior and great food/wine options.
