Went and sat at the bar and the waitress behind the bar was extremely friendly and personable. We ordered the ahi poke, bone marrow, snapper, lamb meat balls, and pork belly. This was the perfect amount to share between two people and every plate was very delicious. The bone marrow does take a little time to make so consider ordering first so you can eat other plates while you wait. Like most tapas, it can get a little costly, so don't come too hungry! Will definitely be hoping to go back and try the rest of the plates as Im sure they are just as amazing."}, {"review_id": "K1lfY0fde9bQF-LZtfXkeA", "user_id": "V2J5y8MOkCoz9-mxJS1brg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I went in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I see Centro every time I drive down California street and wanted to try it because the place looked really cool from the outside. I'd heard it was a fun little place that served tapas so I thought it would be a fun place to go for date night. I went there on Monday around 6:00pm and was seated right away. The restaurant is small and there were a few people in there but the place felt roomy and comfortable. Once we were seated our server came over and took our drink order right away. Those didn't take long and once they were out we placed our order. We tried the lamb meatballs, filthy fries, and pork belly. All of the food was good but my favorite was definitely the meatballs. The portion was a bit small so I was left wanting more. We then ordered the sticky ribs which the server did mention were pretty spicy and wanted to make sure we were ok with that. They were absolutely delicious but ultimately ended up being a little too spicy for me so my boyfriend had to finish them on his own. There was plenty of food for the two of us. Some of the plates were a bit small for the price while some of the other plates were plenty of food for the $8-$14 price range. The bill can add up quickly if you are ordering multiple items but I think the quality of the food justifies the price. Overall the food was delicious, the atmosphere was excellent and the service great. I will definitely be going back."}, {"review_id": "rnHEaOaik8PdwV1hPQFjRA", "user_id": "97Oa7Yh2cjMlvDF1LgpKqA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "This is arguably the best new Gastro-pub in Reno. Super cute decor with the modern garage door twist that we all love these days. Really nice to sit at a high top by the open air and enjoy the people-watching. Fantastic service from everyone we encountered! Five stars on service. At this point you're probably wondering why I only have 3 stars for this rad new spot in Midtown. Well, unfortunately I could only eat one appetizer (when I planned on trying several--they all sound really good) because there was so much salt involved in the one dish I tried to eat. I got the fries (I think they're called Filthy Fries) and they were just way too salty. Like the kind of salty on top where 3 bites in I thought I was going to have to send them back. Under the extra salt on top it got a bit better but still WAY too much sodium for any person to ingest. I couldn't order anything else and ended up driving back to Tahoe before I could even eat again. That kind of salt might be your thing--and if it is then give this dish a shot. But be careful of raising your blood pressure."}, {"review_id": "VCctqD6LKv0e8sWPQPw-IA", "user_id": "Q41Q24UCFsNAS8gZdFnVUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Make sure you get here early! It's on the small side which is great and calls for a fun friendly  evening. We were a table of 5 and expect to wait at 7pm on a Saturday, so we went next door to 1864 for drinks and the hostess called us once a table opened. Everything was great from the beautiful bar to the friendly staff. Shelby, our server was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and was able to give great recommendations on portion size and flavor. We started with the beet salad the sweetness of the beets with the salty soft cheese was perfect to get my taste buds ready for the next courses to come. Next came the Poh Boy (oh boy!) It is not your typical tapas because of its size. It comes in three good sized pieces to share we got 3 for the table. We also had a few orders of the shrimp tacos, lamb chops, hanger steak, filthy fries, sticky ribs, pork belly and scallops all of which were top notch and will definitely be back. Espeacially,  to have the pork belly,  yum! Since the plates are small you can do desert because you don't feel you have to be rolled out of the restaurant.  We shared a chocolate mousse (my favorite), donut holes (or munchkins for anyone from the East Coast) and last but certainly not least the croissant bread pudding. I was really impressed with everything that came to our table and would recommend to anyone looking for a fun delicious evening."}, {"review_id": "6Cjcly0SP7gx4tY6NP0r3g", "user_id": "V985yOjZFlhek2wFJjsebA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "This place epitomizes what Reno should be offering more of.  Centro's a cool pocket-sized place with enormously creative Tapas and Cocktails right on the edge of Midtown.  We often walk from our house to enjoy a late afternoon snack at happy hour (ex. 3 weekly tacos for $5 and $2 off pints) or several small plates made for sharing at dinnertime with friends.  My favorite cocktail in town, the \"Beet El Chapo\", is at Centro. The libation is a perfectly balanced blend of smoky Mezcal, sweet beet simple syrup, citrusy lime and spice from a jalapeño slice.Centro always has a lively vibe with good music playing and the noise of kitchen bustle in the background; it's a great mix between a casual neighborhood restaurant and a more sophisticated urban hang-out."}, {"review_id": "aHL6gWZd0Nc0cQhJCOZWcA", "user_id": "31waNaA_W9uTuLlS0z8Y0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "After a day of light shopping, my companion and I were in the mood for a drink and a light snack. We try to visit a new local place each time we meet up, and enjoy the small businesses that Reno has to offer. Today we went to Centro. Since there isn't any parking in the back of the business, you are at the mercy of finding parking in the street. We found parking easily, but it was also snowing today which may have deterred other from being out and about. I had a glass of prosecco and the filthy fries. She ordered the lamb meatballs and the drink Purple Rain. My fries, which were actually tomato-grape sized baked potatoes, had a delicious NY cheddar sauce, bacon bits, mustard, chives and sliced bratwurst. This was more than a small tapas and has actually kept me full for dinner. Her lamb meatballs were a traditional tapas. I failed to ask her opinion on them. For dessert we split the donut holes.After 20 or so minutes, we were wondering if the waitress forgot to put our order in or if the kitchen screwed up. The person who brought our donut holes out, was kind enough to apologize for the wait. Then the waitress came over and apologized as well and told us that the donuts were comped off our bill. If nothing else, I appreciate a business that can apologize for their short comings. The donut holes had a delicious strawberry compote, but the donuts were lacking. While they were hot, fresh and fully cooked their dough of choice makes for a very dense donut. It was still \"soft\" in the middle, but fully cooked. Regardless, not something I would recommend. Every one we interacted with was kind and polite. That in itself is hard to find, especially in the service industry. The food was good and they had a decent cocktail menu. If you are look for a tapas experience, you should give Centro a try.

Sure! But you only have one night and need to find, THE place to eat . . . let that place be Centro. Quaint location, off the main strip, which means the locals eat here. It's a tapas theme, so you'll need a few plates to make a meal. But every plate seems to be great . . . We started with poke, (I may just be a snob here) but the cut on the fish were a bit rough. The taste was there but it looked chopped. Hubby had pork chops, which fell off the bone. And the kicker, loaded fingerling potato nachos.

What we did is put our name in for a reservation center which is approximately 45 minutes then walk next-door to 1864 to have some delicious cocktails we waited for a table. When you walk into Centro it's obvious that there is a modern, rustic and industrial field which is one of the current trends right now.  this is a tapas style small plates restaurants with a rotating menu which changes approximately every season. The good news is that almost everything on the menu is delicious. The group of at least four people so you can order many different dishes to sample this outstanding menu. Lamb chops were good but not memorable compared to the rest of the menu. The sous vide duck was outstanding. It was cooked perfectly with a tender center then seared and seasoned to add to the texture. For dessert we had the doughnuts which were just ok but not noteworthy as they were simply fresh doughnut holes with cinnamon and jelly on the side.

Centro does of course serve small plates also known as tapas.The menu is small in comparison to traditional restaurants but offers a good variety of small bites that you should be inclined to share with other members in your party. The beauty if small here is that you get to move from flavor profile to flavor profile as you work your way through an unconventional meal with good company.The menu is occasionally changed which will keep your future trips here quite fresh and keep the small menu from feeling too small.All the food we tried varied from good to great with no complaints from anyone in our party.

We were greeted and seated promptly, had a delightful Plum Jerkin cider in my hands in minutes, and a spread underway.First out was the house hummus, followed by the Brussels sprouts, the grape truffles, and the shrimp po boy. The grape truffles were my favorite thing, and honestly I was sad \"you must actually share shared dishes\" was also part of our marital agreement. The hummus was good, the sprouts were also good but i picked around the bacon. It was more like pork belly, fatty and soft -and while I can identify with both those traits in my personal appearance, i want my bacon to have done some crossfit.The flavors of the po boy were great, and while the presentation was beautiful, I would have preferred two sliders as to 3 sections of bun...as my father in law would say \"it's just enough to make you mad.\"We planned on ordering an ahi tower, the daily tartine, and dessert, but our server saved us some money and calories by disappearing for long enough that we just opted for the check instead. Our service was spot on until the last dish came out from the kitchen, and then significantly dropped off. In fairness they appeared to be understaffed - just two guys taking care of front sidewalk, inside, and back patio. (One of those times you wish half stars were an option because it was more of a 3.5 than a 3)Despite this snafu, there will be more visits to Centro in our future.

Well if you really don't like beautifully crafted shareable plates of juicy, tender duck confit or succulent octopus or juicy, fall off the bone ribs. Maybe the thought of precisionly made  bone marrow or ocean fresh tuna with a light wasabi paste or over the top cheesy..bacony..jalapenoey insanely delicious potatoes just don't sound appetizing at all. I could see how sharing wine and smiling and laughing with your closest mates could seem super lame. I don't even know anyone that would like to sit in their creative, comfortable and inviting restaurant with really cool garage style roll up doors that open up in the summer. With their awesome art work and the light hint of melody flowing through the air. So if your really bored one day and have absolutely nothing better to do than enjoy a delicious cocktail or two or a glass of bubbly paired with mouth watering lamb or maybe a scallop plate.
