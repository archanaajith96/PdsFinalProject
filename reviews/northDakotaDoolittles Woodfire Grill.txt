Service was great. I had the sirloin and it came with potatoes and green beans. My only complaint would be my steak came out rare and I ordered it medium. It was still good and they were busy so I elected to eat it as is. I'm not very picky in that regard. My wife did say she would have sent it back. My wife had scallops and she said they were very good."}, {"review_id": "V_bAMuUjlWfhEqXx19Ta0w", "user_id": "-rLIAlTp1RaB5-RdoHx17Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "The food was mediocre. My boyfriend's burger was very raw in the middle -- he asked for it medium rare, but it came back VERY rare. That is the only time I have ever seen him bring back his own food at a restaurant. It was expensive for the tastes, and he arugula was pretty brown in our appetizer. I suggest going somewhere else, especially for the high prices."}, {"review_id": "LH3qap-BrwnWDF4EwySC6Q", "user_id": "58IYRjxtf_E4XNUXysecdw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "Located just off the Interstate, this is a solid dinner choice when in Fargo.  When we pulled up, the first sign was a good one: a packed parking lot on a Monday night!  What we didn't know is that Monday night is half-priced bottle of wine!  Although this is some of reason for the crowd, I can tell you that the food is excellent, so read on...I was in the mood for something as bit different and so I tried their pork tenderloin and spicy chili, sweet potato and corn hash.  This was enough food for Paul Bunyan!  I did finish the sliced pork tenderloin, but could not finish all of the hash.My coworker had the half rack of ribs.  Our server was nice enough to substitute healthy broccoli for the type potato side.  The ribs were more than 6 bones and the sauce was not too heavy.The side salads were extra, but were almost big enough for entrees.Our server, Kyle, was an affable Dakotan who kept our water glasses full and made good recommendations from the menu.  The manager stopped by to check on our food and was happy to hear about our positive experience.I think this building might have been another restaurant at one point in time.  It is a big open kitchen concept with several small rooms around a sunken main dining area.  There is also separate bar area with TVs."}, {"review_id": "AltjV58CuRK3S07mH5M6iw", "user_id": "C-ObuoSf6iXBnc0MgAJBrw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Great spot for casual dining.

While a few mentioned other restaurants, Doolittles drew the most votes. Considering most of the people grew up in the city I took their advice, headed to Doolittles and wasn't disappointed. Since then I've now been to all the locations in this small chain, most of them at least two times. Having traveled the Great Lakes for the past two decades it's safe to say the walleye (and other entrees) are must-haves when dining here. This particular location always comes with consistency. There's plenty of TVs around for us to watch games while we grab a bite (in the bar). Whether solo, on a date, with buddies or the family there's something for everyone on the menu and it's priced fair for what you receive. For Fargo some complain it's too expensive. Meanwhile, you get what you pay for. It's one of the better places to eat in town. There's plenty of items to choose from. However, we focus on two core items: chicken and walleye. When it comes to walleye you can get it three ways. You can order it as a filet, as walleye fingers or a walleye sandwich. The key is the breading. The breading is wonderful on all of them and and makes this dish better than average. Personally, I normally go with the filet  because it's a larger portion and I don't need the bread that comes with the sandwich. However, if everyone wants to order something else you can order the walleye fingers as an appetizer.It's hard to beat the rotisserie chicken, too (and many tell me the smoked wings are equally tasty). It's always juicy, flavorful and clearly fresh. Normally, we'll get the half chicken. It's more than enough to feed even a hungry guy. While I haven't tried all of their soups the roasted tomato is awesome. To be honest other than the ham sandwich we haven't tried many other items because frankly there's no reason to. When these dishes taste as good as they do it's okay to be a creature of habit. The staples have done us well and they will impress you, too."}, {"review_id": "KzdbaKRcI8SEhX13aOa1Bw", "user_id": "ggdfsdVPcUBtDBZd5DyWmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "I've been to this restaurant many times over the years.

The baked goat cheese was lacking any sort of texture and as far as goat cheese goes, pretty bland.  The tuna was dry.  However, the meal turned around with the short ribs; cooked to perfection and falling off the bone, they were magical.  Service and ambience were average, nothing exceptional.  Overall a bit expensive for an average meal."}, {"review_id": "VT5UvNEPSYafeOU0Xu-xog", "user_id": "R1QQPGTMWYW2FqFBMtUEig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "If you want amazing food and excellent service, Doolittles is your place.

I ordered the top stirloin and a salad. The salad was delicious and a very generous portion! The steak was a big disappointment. I asked for a medium, which is what I normally get at steakhouses and nice restaurants. The steak was cooked at what seemed to me like rare. The server took it back and had them cook it some more, but when I got it back it still seemed undercooked and I just ate the edges instead of bothering to have it redone again. The green beans and potatoes that came with the steak were also undercooked. The green beans were very crunchy and the potatoes were hard and most had crunch in the middle as well. I also had a crem brulee at the end which was cool, in my experience these are served warm, but maybe I'm just being nit-picky at this point. Overall, for 6pm on a Wednesday night, Doolittles was pretty disappointing, especially for the price."}, {"review_id": "FF8kkvFRWxa89WKBwyj5cw", "user_id": "ye_nJiHcO3R3dPpa1gBLig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2017", "text": "Our server, Austin, was PHENOMENAL, and this place has the absolute best water I have ever had the joy of putting in my face.
