This is a place that has stayed true to its roots: ⁃ a tiny single room with several tables crammed together ⁃ a single laminated menu with generously portioned entrees priced around $10 ⁃ dozens of paintings and pictures of prominent African-American figures from a large classic 70's era Jesse Jackson oil painting to a small and as compelling painting of Barack Obama ⁃ Patrons consisting of a steady mix of eager tourists alongside blue collar local regulars ⁃ Live music in the form of a woman playing electric guitar and singing classic country soul records in a space about 1 ft x 1 ft next to the cash register where you pay on the way out ⁃ Service by a waitress who talks with you and makes you feel like they've known you their whole life And the food on my plate: bbq ribs were amazing, the Mac n cheese was heavenly, and the spicy collard greens were a standout.  I also sampled some of the sweet potatoes which were quite good. Corn bread was a bit dry and the desserts were a bit too sweet for me but those were minor bits.Must try if you're in Jackson."}, {"review_id": "IThCheijz4Z5FCptvUXHoQ", "user_id": "95z6HhgE4C9fKhhKyXmDLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Bully's The atmosphere is not why you come to Bully's, but the homely charm is always present. Everyone is cousin!Food is amazing. I had the veggie plate. Collards, Lima beans, dressing, okra/tomatoes, cornbread, and peach cobbler. Everything was seasoned perfectly. Kreskin had the fried chicken, string beans, and fried green tomatoes. Talking with Mr Bully and his family was great. This is an absolute staple in our community, and for good reason.

Best meal in Jackson!Bully's, like many restaurants here I'm finding, closes before evening. I'm accustomed to eating late, and had to plan my trip to Bully's on my way to a late-start workday. I drove 20 minutes out of the way and tip-toed through two 15 mph school zones, to try their food,because people rave about it. And...I'd do it again, and again, and yet again!I ordered a fried poke (yep, poke chop), turnip and collar greens, and fried corn.Let me tell you, the only way to describe the fry on that chop is DIVINE!!! The fried corn and the greens were so fresh and flavorful. My meal with a sweet tea was about $10. The staff are the epitome of \"Southern Hospitality\". I didn't mind the 15 minute wait and the shuffling of cars in the small crowded parking.Thank you, Bully's!"}, {"review_id": "MnBXeybXQcphUI24ry-JIA", "user_id": "Gx23ypE0KqpjHiShkJUcfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Hands down the BEST soul food and the BEST service in Jackson!

Perfectly cooked. But aside from the food being great, the people are what makes this place special. The owner \"Mr. Bully\" I presume, Mrs. Greta, and Mrs. Jackie that waited on me were so thankful that I came for a visit, and were all eager to find out where I was from and how I heard of this place.

I did grab a bite of my wife's fried chicken...and I know what I'm ordering next.  It honestly was one of the better fried chickens I've had.  Not greasy, chicken was juicy, and the breading just perfect.  The cooks here know what they are doing with the fryer.So from the friendly service (everyone from the cashier to the owner were wishing us a happy new year), price, and honest solid Southern food, this is what you have been looking for in the South.  Highly recommended."}, {"review_id": "AifQLSdSUo85vn1O8xLkEw", "user_id": "K1gGq5rgLiakzNB0kXCYjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "True Southern hospitality... everyone was friendly and engaging, including the other patrons.  We tried catfish, beef tips, fried corn (it's like creamed corn, except the corn is a bit more crisp), greens, mac & cheese, cornbread, lemonade, and banana pudding.  Both main dishes were perfectly seasoned and cooked, and I also loved the corn and greens.  The macaroni was tasty but a little too mushy.  Cornbread was not flavorful enough for me to enjoy it much on its own, however it went well with the food.  Lemonade was not sour enough for me, but it's probably just right for people who enjoy sweet drinks.  Banana pudding was awesome!  Prices are very reasonable.  Bring cash if you want to avoid the $1 processing fee for debit/credit card transactions."}, {"review_id": "Voz2ZKbfYPd0_IE9GTIraQ", "user_id": "MXfq1rErM16VtlSFWJoBjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "Soul Food.

You just sit down, order and BOOM here comes Joy. And if need refills on Ice Tea and ( I drink a ton )NO Problem. It's a place that sets a really high standard that other dining establishments should try to emulate. The only negative is getting there on the Pot Hole filled Jackson, Mississippi streets.

This means it was cooked perfectly.Normally I would complain about the lack of homemade tartar and cocktail sauce but here it doesn't even matter.
