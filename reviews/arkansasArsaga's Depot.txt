Their fresh roasted coffee is one factor that draws us back. They always have their house blend and at least two others to enjoy along with a selection of teas and blended coffee drinks. They serve several crepes, both savory and sweet. Their War Eagle cheese grits and house cured bacon are restaurant specialties. The English muffins and sourdough toast are freshly baked.On Saturday and Sunday, the brunch specialty is biscuits and gravy and are well worth what may be a wait on those days.The staff members are always friendly and efficient. Arsaga's is definitely one of our favorite places in Fayetteville."}, {"review_id": "OLqXql2iXY4wWSv-VbVQvg", "user_id": "TBIrx2oC08dWEbUoEhhH9g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Over hyped. The atmosphere is cool but becomes way less impressive when the staff shuffles you around to other tables to accommodate parties that are apparently more important. You can discover this for yourself if you can find a parking spot. Onyx coffee is better and the staff is way more chill. Updated: lowered from 2 to 1 star. Friend chose this place for brunch. I asked for coconut milk in my coffee and friend was offered jam for her toast which she accepted. When we got the check there were $1 and $.75 fees for those items respectively. Wait staff is expected to explain upcharges, sub charges, and other fees. I would have had absolutely no problem paying either fee it they had been mentioned up front. But that they were just added with no explanation isn't acceptable."}, {"review_id": "IZ91mNmlWHgUg5kYoNigOw", "user_id": "-50lprJ4kZ-XCM1hPU2vqg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "It was alright. They had a couple of vegan options. The disappointing thing was they had no vegan cheese. They had vegan chili and vegan sausage though. The vibe was busy. The seating was a little different.

I was in town visiting my daughter when we decided to go out on one of our tour Fay jaunts when we decided let's go there. Needless to say this will now become one of our favorite brunch places to eat and commiserate.

They've got some truly fantastic food - but my favorite aspect, by far, was the drink menu. They do have alcoholic options (beer/wine only), but they also have a lengthy menu that's mixed spices, teas, and juices made with the same mixologist love as fancy cocktails, but fine for a work day.I'd give them five stars almost for those drinks alone, holy crap!My one and only quibble is the patio. The patio itself is spectacular, especially on a nice afternoon. It's shaded, covered and sheltered, but looks off into woods/over some unused train tracks. Very nice!The quibble though, it's regular seating next to a tall railing. Bar stools would be absolutely perfect, or a shorter railing. As it is though, it's nice normal seating with a big, thick railing perfectly at eye-level. Shame :/"}, {"review_id": "Ye-chlhIcdcEGSfNRTiCew", "user_id": "eeYpiVL5DqWsNB39PHL9Yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Lovely outdoor eating in the back. Watched the bike riders go by.

DO NOT PARK IN THE LOT. THEY WILL BOOT YOUR CAR AS SOON AS THE TIMER RUNS OUT.Driving through Fayetteville on a Sunday. My wife and I were looking for a good place to have brunch. We arrived at 12:30 p.m. and learned there was a 45 minute wait. We decided to park in the Fayetteville Depot parking lot in front of the restaurant and go for a walk. When we came back to the restaurant, there were parking attendants waiting to boot your car. This is a private lot and they literally wait around for your time to expire and then charge you $40 to unboot your car. TOTAL SCAM."}, {"review_id": "UpFBU0j35wDX0pifpH-ZjQ", "user_id": "QIb_1So2VpN-zd8rQTg6xw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "Came here with a group of friends on my visit to Fayetteville Arkansas and tried my friends omelette I believe it was the townie whichever the vegan one was. I had a burger I forgot which one aha but I can recall it being one of the better ones I've had in my lifetime. The girl who served us was slightly rude to my friend who asked to order quickly since she was on a time crunch and the girl replied \"I'm not doing food orders yet\" which came off as rude. The food was good the price was fair but the poor mannered waitress kinda ruined what could be a 5 Star review. Be more personal and don't come off as snappy to new customers and the food is a 5 star but the rude waitress is why I'm only leaving a 3 Star."}, {"review_id": "osOh-BLBpQXivpz7ZVCHWw", "user_id": "R7Gmv06cwhLLKpaBcPfgrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "I just had such a lovely meal here this morning. The staff is incredibly friendly, the outside seating is breezy and wonderful, the water is thirst quenching , and the food I just ate was ****ing amazing. I got The Redmond which is an open face sandwich with miso sweet potatoes, a soft boiled egg, a type of chimichuri sauce, green onions, and carrots served with a side of herb potatoes and garlic aioli. Holy smokes. It was so good. Do you ever just eat something and wish you could relive the moment? Well that's me right now. I'm just sitting reminiscing about the meal I just had wishing I just rolled in to Arsaga's for the first time and my meal was just now being delivered. If you haven't been here, do. If you think it's a hipster dive and not worth the effort, you're making a huge mistake for skipping out on such an outstanding local restaurant. I will be back here again and again. This place was absolutely amazing.Side note: the prices here are reasonable and worth every penny."}, {"review_id": "QPyNAnkkqcek0tYKFiKIyw", "user_id": "WZZZsGdz7ZcJPjPySdDPlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "Love this place.

Like, really really good. Their specialty drinks are also amazing. However, I docked it two stars because it always takes forever to get a seat and get served.I haven't had a crepe here I haven't loved. Arsaga's has both sweet and savory crepes, and if you're looking for a great gluten free option, request the buckwheat crepe in lieu of whatever crepe comes standard for the dish.Okay, so here's the deal on the wait time. The management and owners really are trying to be innovative and make it better for the customers, but the execution is not there. Last time I was there, we were told that the wait would be around 30 minutes and that we would receive a text message when it was time to be seated, giving us the option to leave the restaurant and come back. That was great. We left, and not wanting to miss our reservation, we were sure to be back 30 minutes later, even though we had not received our text message yet. However, whenever we arrived, we were told by the staff we needed to wait outside. It was a very cold day with a very cold wind chill. I told her no because it was cold, and she told me I needed to go out to my car. I was not parked near the restaurant because parking was not available. Waiting outside is something I see working well in the warmer months, but it will not work in the winter.Arsaga's has a decent cup of coffee, but the drinks that really stand out are their seasonal drinks. Some of them are coffee drinks, some of them are not, like their lavender lemonade. I would recommend trying their seasonal drinks while you can!I really enjoy the food and atmosphere of Arsaga's, but the wait time makes it hard to enjoy. If you're going to visit, visit on a weekday afternoon when it's less busy"}, {"review_id": "yL0mBiXK7TLNyorGTF-v1w", "user_id": "V_VBZ9o2ppky8fUnzvRfGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "Wow!
