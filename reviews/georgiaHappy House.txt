I chose to go to this one because it had more reviews. Which turned out to be a terrible decision. On arrival there was one occupied table, this was two hours before closing. I picked my table, sat and was quickly greeted. I asked for a sweet tea, no sweet tea. I asked for a coke and they brought out a can with a glass filled with ice which means I'll have to pay for any additional cola. The food was okay, nothing to run home about. I ordered the Bul Go Ki along with Shumai as an appetizer. The Shumai was terribly small and you get 6 pieces for 5.99, ouch. The Bul Go Ki was tasty and came with 6 sides which were meh, they do refill the sides for you, not sure if there was any additional charges for that. The service was good but again, that should be expected if there was only one other occupied table. The kicker is that they do not accept AMEX, the only establishment out of 20+ I've been to in Augusta that doesn't, makes it a pain if you are traveling for work. Next time I'm in Augusta I'll try out the other Korean spot as everything that this one doesn't offer, they do."}, {"review_id": "XQAH_pVCc6eQ_8usSAah0w", "user_id": "TKtVBE9DKFRRdOdwhn0SZA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "I want to start off by saying that these prices make me feel like I've been robbed. I literally paid $10 for yukgaejang last week in Duluth and came to Augusta having to pay $16.99?? The prices in New York don't even cost this much. I understand there's much less competition in this area, but that is ridiculous.*some menu photos are old and prices are higher nowAnyways, I ordered to go because they close at 9pm. We placed our order around 8:15pm and it took about 25 minutes for our order to be ready (we would've never been able to finish before 9). I ordered 2 yukgaejang for $16.99 each and an order of spicy squid for $17.99. Food: the yukgaejang was on the sweet side for me, not as savory as I like. I would say it's plentiful, but I've also never ordered this to go and I didn't pour it out of the container. The yukgaejang has some shredded beef, green onions, eggs, noodles, and a few pieces of gosari (tastes similar to dried mushrooms). Overall, not bad, but I will not pay almost $19 for it again. My friend really enjoyed her spicy squid and said it was plentiful, however, it had a really strong fishy smell - it came with plenty of zucchini and carrots."}, {"review_id": "485a5oFdBEMHL4rWH9NHnQ", "user_id": "3Rh4z7OoZQoH6LXgh783YA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Yummo!

They were very accommodating to a crowd. Thought there would be eight people and they already had the table set up for it. There ended up only being five and they did not make a fuss. The place ended up getting crowded by the time we left around 8. Chiming in with everyone else, this area is not the best by any means and I hope they don't lose business because of that. Now onto the food, they brought what looked like pickled cucumbers and kimchi initially and then when the meals came they brought out spinach, pickled daikon radishes, some type of noodles and they were all delicious. I think I picked way too much at them because I barely ate any of my meal. I told her I wanted it at a medium spice level and it still came with some heat but the spicy squid was so delicious. I ate an entire thing of rice just to soak up the sauce and ended up bringing a second thing of rice for my leftovers. This will not be my last time here. The two ladies who waited on us were so sweet, as well. Also tried the soju alcoholic beverage that a friend ordered and was not a huge fan of it."}, {"review_id": "MKc2K28t9p1Xk0BkQRxIAQ", "user_id": "R23hCTCR0rPJP2cWOJfjwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Coming here I was a little skeptical because the roads that are around the restaurant are a little rough, but it was amazing there!Food was delicious, service was fantastic.The meal came with banchan and rice and they were really nice with refilling the dishes.We ordered the LA kalbi and spicy squid.If you can handle the spice of Kimchi then you can handle the spice of the squid dish. The beef was full of flavor and very tender. Portions were big enough for two in my opinion, the waitress even gave me options on how to reheat/recook the squid since I had leftovers. She suggested not to microwave and instead mix it with the rice and stir fry to create a spicy squid fried rice. I never had any problems with the food, but the restaurant has a terrible odor that smells like a sewage pipe broke right in the restaurant. This has prevented me from going back again."}, {"review_id": "V9zsZ98U_dLTvSIU-cDEUQ", "user_id": "qcAND7HNGbmlh7_sWvFF0g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "A friend and I went to Augusta to visit the Cabela's Outpost and we are both Korean Food fans having served in Korea while in the military, so we had to try some local fare. We settled on the Happy House and found the setting to be OK and the server was exceptionally nice. The prices were a great deal higher then those found in Columbia SC but the food was pretty good and we tried the barley tea and we both found it to be tasty. I had the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi  and the chicken was tender spiced nicely, my friend had the Beef Bulgogi and he was not as satisfied with his. The portions were large but there only six kimchi bowl and we are accustomed to receiving 12 at our place in Columbia. All in all it was a good experience but a bit too overpriced in my opinion."}, {"review_id": "YkZE0ZR7WZZquetM35_w_Q", "user_id": "sXccOuVx25toGWS86hS4XA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/14/2017", "text": "This review has been a long time coming.Everyone leaves Happy House happy!

The food is also very very good! I love the bulgogi, yakimondo, and bimbap. They bring kim chi sides for whole table and it's basically bottomless.

I'm from the Atlanta area so I thought finding good Korean food here in Augusta would be a lost cause. Behold, Happy House did not disappoint me. Their servings are huge and their side dishes are delicious. I usually judge the restaurant's food based on the side dishes, so when I had their side dishes here, I knew I was going to leave full and satisfied. I ordered the spicy stir fry squid to go. I got 2 orders for me and my husband (we both eat like bears), but I really should have ordered one. We ate the food twice a day for 2 days. Not only are the servings big, I spent less than $30 with tip! Y'all go to this place and indulge.

You walk in and you get a great welcome from the cutest little Korean women...and get seated with no problem. The menu breaks down the dishes so you know what you're ordering instead of just looking at the items name. Perfect for those who don't know anything about Korean dishes. Your order arrives, and you get a nice variety of kimchi (6 kinds). The food is plated deliciously and in abundance, so bring your appetite. The staff is so wonderful and energetic, they even took the time to help my son with using chopsticks. The atmosphere is low key and quiet, just the noise of plates and the cooking going on. The patrons aren't loud, the staff isn't loud or rude, there's 2 tvs on both sides of the restaurant aren't ceiling fans keeping things cool (not too cold not to hot)."}, {"review_id": "fZiMwpT8wBioUawhcadG2w", "user_id": "uJdghQ7f8snapKrYxfZidQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2016", "text": "We ordered so much food because everything on the menu sounded beyond delicious.

I only ordered the take out today, the place is bit of sketchy and it smells bad inside- but I don't see ppl inside got bothered... but I did, so I stepped out and wait. The price compare to big city is a bit too much for Korean food. Averagely $3 more on each dish- probably because not many competition in town.

Very good and variety of refillable side dish (Kimchi, seasoning preserved vegetable). Rice can be refilled either. I always go there once a week, order Gal bi tang and LA galbi. Gal bi tang is a beef rib soup, boiled overnight making beef very tender and soup has incredible taste. I tried many time to cook soup like, but never taste as good as this dish. LA gal bi is a grilled thin slice of beef-rib served on hot place, this dish made me go to this restaurant again and again, never feel bored.
