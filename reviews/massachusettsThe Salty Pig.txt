The food and service were incredible.Having such a good experience, I brought my parents when they came to visit. Walked in raving to them how awesome it was. We sat down. The waiter came over, no smile. We asked a question about the menu, and got a very matter-of-fact answer: \"No\". Then silence. No follow-up information. We asked a question about the cheeses and the waiter rattled off some names extremely quickly. Then silence. No one at the table understood what he had said. Ok, did we offend him somehow? Interactions thereafter with us were short and extremely succinct. Only at the end when the bill came did we get a half smile. Either he wanted to save his tip or he was ecstatic we were leaving. Maybe both.The first time service was A+. We had a waiter who was friendly and helpful. The next time, we seemed to have a waiter that couldn't stand us.

It's one of my favorite things in the world. I love being able to assemble small little bites of stinky cheeses and salty meats, paired with mustards, jams and pickled vegetables, it's great. When I heard there was a spot in Boston that not only had great charcuterie and cheese platters, but also pizza?! I had to come to Salty Pig to see for myself. WAIT/RESERVATIONSVery easy to make reservations on their website for lunch. Dinner, you can only make reservations for parties of 6 or more. It was pretty packed on a Saturday afternoon and I expected to wait about 30 minutes to an hour if I didn't make a reservation.FOODThe Salty Pig Board ($16) came with Prosciutto Cotto, Marinated Olives, Pickled Greens, Spicy Mustard, Pate, Ovaline Mozzarella and Bread. Feel free to ask for more vegetables and bread because they initially give you about 4 slices, but there's simply too many combinations and possibilities for you just to enjoy 4. Mix it up, have some fun with it. Now, the pizza. Salty Pig's pizza did not disappoint either. There's something about having a cooked egg on top of my pizza, it just makes me so happy. I ordered the Funghi Pizza ($15) and we wanted some additional veggies so added Arugula to it. It was creamy, rich and delicious and had Crema Di Prosciutto on it too. The Salty Pig Board and the Pizza was more than enough food for two people and it didn't break the bank either. It was a great meal for two people to be utterly stuffed to the point of no return. Would highly recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "3xIh71IZcW23wBIxX7rpZA", "user_id": "Y_NVgxBRcII68dSuwfNHAQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "If you've read a handful of my reviews, especially some of the less-than-stellar ones, then you know that I am a stickler for value. Excluding the travesty that they call a chocolate cake, the food (by itself) here was a definite four, and possibly five stars. Their menu is an interesting concept for sure. Great charcuterie and awesome pizza. The service was great and fairly quick too. ... If you've read my reviews, you would also be aware that I like to go into maddening detail. With this, consider the above paragraph a TL;DR... here comes my massive assemblage of thoughts:So, what did I have:1. Chorizo (from the \"Salty Pig Parts\" section)2. Governatore pizza3. Chocolate cake1. I learned ex-post (after the fact) how this part of the menu is actually supposed to work. This is a charcuterie board where you pick the parts that it will come with. Just ordering one thing will deprive you of the full experience. The board was delicious though! Everything on it was of really high quality. The bread was fresh and tasty, the mustard was flavorful, but not mouth-scorchingly spicy, sitting right on the golden mean. The pickles were great in their balance too! The bring was a great blend of saltiness and sweetness, with an overall mild flavor. Then there was the chorizo. I did not find it too spicy (maybe a little bit) which is great for those who don't like too much heat. Other flavors were on point too, with a great savoriness, and not too much salt!However, based on my experience, I feel the charcuterie part of the menus is not a great value. Because I assume) the bread, mustard, and pickles come with the board as opposed to chorizo, I got somewhere between 6-8 (don't recall) paper thin slices of, albeit great chorizo, for 8 bucks. It was good, but not *that* good.2. Then there was the pizza... this reminded me a lot of the kinds of pizzas I'd had in Naples. The pizza is so thin, eating it by folding is almost impossible. This is the kind of pizza which must be eaten by fork and knife.  The pizza itself was very flavorful! it wasn't overly greasy, and the tomatoes actually tasted like high-quality, fresh tomatoes, as opposed to something out of a jar that's had the ever-loving processed out of it. Proportions were balanced too, and for the pizza being as thin as it is, the amount of crumbled sausage was not at all bad.My gripe here is that it was not the pizza advertised. This was almost a hybrid of the Margherita and governatore. It had basil, but it was lacking in peppers and onions! Oops.3. When it came to dessert, there were two options, to which my friend said \"you can't go wrong with chocolate cake. Regrettably, this place did. The cake was some mousse and two thick, dense, uninteresting chocolate \"cookies.The service was quick and efficient, although I will say they were perhaps a little too efficient. They took away the board that held the charcuterie a bit quick! There were still some of those delicious pickles on there. I could have said something, but it wasn't that big a deal. I'd also like to point out that the lighting is rather low (and if you are seated facing the bar, those lights are quick harsh relative to the atmosphere. Finally, you may end up sitting at a communal table.Even though 3 stars is less-than-stellar, this is still a great place! I do look forward to returning and trying a more fully loaded charcuterie board!"}, {"review_id": "hIJnKqp1ardskp13OfBimA", "user_id": "iFDHgFbztK-aCQKjyYeifg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "We came for a Sunday lunch with a group of 4 girls.

The chorizo was smoky, not spicy. The cheeses were exactly as described on the menu. The olives were all unique, but had an orange Britney taste.

First, they DO take reservations, but they refuse to take same-day reservations. I tried to call a few hours before my party of six wanted to dine, they refused to take a same-day reservation, I asked why, and the employee on the phone said they just don't, only next day, etc. Then she assured me that they'd be able to get us in after probably only 20-30 minutes because they do reserve some tables for walk-in parties. We braved it. When we arrived, they said it would be a 30-minute wait. We returned 30 minutes later, they said probably another 15 minutes. In total we waited an hour, and at that point we told them to just get us two tables and we split three and three. I would give them a 5-star rating if we hadn't had so much trouble getting the table - I do get that they can't control every aspect of the table service times, but it's a much better rule to overestimate than underestimate, and I'm still baffled as to why they refused to take a same-day reservation. Luckily the the food was worth the wait. Some very good options on every area of their menu, some classic choices and some exciting unconventional options. They had a massive array available for the charcuterie board! I got the Lecco pizza, and it was delicious - loved the sunchoke!"}, {"review_id": "qmQhXBiV7h-w7krQ_gokeg", "user_id": "zuGXrW6gko2hiRX-a2JXKw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "The girlfriend took me here to show me \"the best meatball subs evvvvvaaaaa.\" Her words not mine We made reservations for 8pm but we both got there around 7 due to us finding fantastic parking spots. Oh man the luck! We walked in and ahead was a relatively small space that had a fun (albeit quirky) decor. There were literally chalkboards with scribbles and people everywhere. It looked full but we asked the hostess if she could seat us early. She paused for a second, looked at her seating chart, and asked us to follow her to an open table. Scored a table right by the window.It was pretty loud but not impossible to hear one another. Actually, after we sat down and I started singing along to Brittney Spears' \"Oops I did it again\" which was playing over the speakers, I heard the gasp that launched a thousand stares. Nowhere on the menu were the words MEATBALL SUB. I dabbed a tear from the girlfriends eye and heroically stated, \"It's okay hun, I'll find something you'll be sure to love!\" No I never said that but the rest of the story is true lol. We settled on the charcuterie plate which they conveniently set up on the menu as step 1, 2, and 3 for cheese, meats, and sides. The waiter also graciously put in a side order of meatball marinara and toast. We thought it was odd that they couldn't put the meatballs in the bread but hey, it was close enough. In summary, the food was good, the music was late 90s-early 2000s pop, and the wine/ beer selection was on point.

The bone marrow was pretty good but better without bread as the bread kills the rich flavor.The salty pig pizza were one of the best pizza ive ever had.

The meatballs were very moist and their tomato sauce was like crack.. just so good!I miss their BLT! They don't serve that item anymore. The BLT was not your average one. They put in a thick cut pork belly, so it was even jucier! If you're a bacon lover, this was an amazing BLT.The charcuterie plates are never a disappointment.

I especially liked the addition of radicchioPOLPETTE (meatballs & Sunday gravy)GoodCHICKEN (can't remember its name and no longer on menu)Very, very salty. It seemed like the chicken had been brined and the sauce was also very salty. Our server promptly took the dish away and the manager even came over to apologize.MEAT & CHESSE (to replace chicken)Prosciutto di Parma, Chorizo Iberico de Bellota, Invierno and the Dorset. The meats and cheeses themselves were delicious! We struggled to pair the meats and cheeses. At the time there were limited soft, subtle cheeses which I wanted to pair with the proscuitto. I also wanted a manchego like cheese for the chorizo iberico but they didn't have anything similar enough. I think this could be improved upon. We left it to our server to select the \"Round Outs.\" One of his choices was the Shallot Marmalade which is amazingly delicious!Definitely will return to try some other things and for the really cool vibe."}, {"review_id": "-_qXkpFuRQZsthIip-7CdA", "user_id": "mNwxxYNzLpuUGRiLavlJyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I stopped here for dinner on a whim one night, and we were SO impressed.
