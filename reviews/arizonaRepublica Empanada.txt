The waiter was very accommodating and knew exactly what was vegan. He directed me to a two empanada plate and I picked the two vegan empanadas they had (chickpea veggie, and potato). Both were delicious, and they were super nice about giving us extra sauce. The french fries were house made and fresh, also yummy. Even if you're not vegan, this place is fantastic. But 5 stars for taking care of the vegans.

Unfortunately after trying out multiple different empanada places, we found the food here to be good but nothing stellar.I had the Empanada platter with the Republica Chicken and the Jalapeño Popper. The platter came with rice, beans, cabbage salad, and maduro's & creama. My husband got the same platter with the Pernil and the Cubana. I personally liked both of the empanadas but the side dishes were a bit bland.The service was good and we enjoyed sitting outside. They have a really nice space! Overall, I'm sure we'll return. Next time, I'm going to be trying one or two of the dessert empanadas!"}, {"review_id": "lL9x88sXOV1ntM89kIcapw", "user_id": "LHXbPNcRv2fzJPS-v7jy_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Disclaimer - I am not familiar with this cuisine, but everything I tried was very good. We had three empanadas - ground beef, pork, and chicken.  We tried the beans and rice as well as the salad. The sweet date empanada we had for dessert was absolutely special. That might be worth a second trip by itself. OTOH - They were way over their heads on managing a preconcert crowd. The service was far below even an amateur standard. My reservation was ignored and my reserved table given to someone with no reservation right in front of me while I was standing there being ignored for almost 10 minutes. The host, while clueless, to his credit was also the busboy and a server. He was set up to fail. Then the harried waitress, took someone's order who had been seated after me and quickly turned her back on me. She was standing three feet from us. However, she was extremely skilled in the art of not making eye contact and only doing one thing at a time. She offered no help negotiating the menu and we had to rudely yell for her attention and force her to write down what we wanted. Her preference seemed to be causing a scene as she thought the afore mentioned yell was beneath her \"calling.\"  She is not a natural server - more likely voted most likely to file a liability law suit - chip on the shoulder comes at no extra charge. On a slack night these same people are likely the nicest folks anyone would want to meet. They would have greeted us, seated us, chatted us through the cuisine, and served us with charm. They were understaffed, untrained, and overwhelmed. Happily the food was very good. Probably just bad timing.

It was a pickup order and my kids ended up wanting to eat inside rather than in our car so we sit outside and she walks out later and says \"oh I see you decided to eat here\" but with a real stern unhappy look. I ordered empanadas for my kids and luckily they liked them... I took a bite and they were ok, nothing at all special... I have this place a second shot thinking maybe last experience was just a one off but it was just the same as last time. Very very poor customer service for non regulars, no welcome, no smile. And on top of that their empanadas are not anything memorable... I just don't understand what everyone is seeing in this place. . It's really just a hype, I mean, they were featured on TV, maybe that's why people want to reflect \"ooh I ate at this cool hip restaurant that was on TV so I'll give it 5 stars\". Not me.Food is not memorable, so far I've tried 6 different savory empanadas and none have made me think, damn, I need these in my life!Place is cool inside, nice decor, Latin hipCustomer service is sorely sorely lacking... Didn't make up for the food in any way."}, {"review_id": "nP5PeUwu6cJGdNTdQalBnA", "user_id": "L4dg-hA4Ek0M9sSBMJCqWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "What an excellent find! A cute place off of downtown Mesa. When my husband and I got there, we were impressed to see that the place was not your typical just average Mesa style restaurant. This place looks like some of those little mom and pop shops in downtown Scottsdale! When you arrive, you wait to get seated. They prepare the table for you and ask you to come in. We decided to sit at the patio cause it wasn't super cold tonight. While walking to the patio, I noticed a long bar like table in the middle of the place and other tables on the side. Everyone is so welcoming when you come in, even when we arrived 35 min before close! We were given time to go over the menu and then our waiter came to take our drink orders and go over some menu options with us since it was our first time. He was very patient and explained a lot of dishes to us and made recommendations for some of their best dishes. The menu is not extensive but they have a good selection of appetizers, mains, tortas and of course Empanadas. We ordered the Posole soup with chicken. It comes with a lot of toppings to add on top, kinda like Pho. It is served also with a piece of bread. This soup was so good. It's like a great pick me up soup after a long day or on a cold night, warm and very comforting. We also ordered the Yuca Fritas. I had never tried Yuca before. It's a more starchy version of potatoes almost, (for the people who like me, don't know what Yuca is). It was served with an excellent house ranch dip. For our mains, we decided to order the chicken, mushroom and kalamata olive empanadas and the potato empanadas. Out of the two, the potato one was my favorite, especially with their homemade green salsa! Prices were very good. At the beginning we thought  the food we ordered won't be enough, especially since we were super hungry but our waiter was right in recommending our portions, we ended up eating everything and we felt full. Service is beyond excellent. Tonight, I saw maybe 7 different people take care of us one way or another till we were done with our meal. The patio seating area looked so pretty tonight and they had a heater turned on for me because I was feeling cold, and that's when they over heard me saying I was cold! That's service! This place just started off the weekend for me on an excellent note. So happy to have found it and will be going there again for sure! Definitely worth trying!"}, {"review_id": "XiEcGZ9Ryitb_VGewzqlfw", "user_id": "QfDmOuhlOaLCuy2dwq3Azw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "Checked out this spot with the fam a few weeks ago.

We ask for four empanadas and the tostones to be brought out together.  Flash forward 10 minutes to the tostones being brought out sans empanadas.  Fine, I'll eat those first.  They're basically wet discs of plantain and were clearly fried in oil that wasn't hot enough.  Yum. Around this point my attention is drawn to a waitress who is yelling at a cook.  She's asking \"Who are these for???\" while holding a plate with 4 empanadas.  I have a good idea who those are for.  She says she needs a to-go order and then, not knowing who's food this is, throws those empanadas in a bag and sends the to-go customer on their way.  The same waitress then awkwardly makes her way over to our table a minute later (she wasn't our waitress) and with a \"please don't ask me any questions\" look on her face tells us our food should be out shortly.  Eventually it comes out.  It's fine.   We hastily pay the bill and head for the door of the still 80% empty restaurant.  What do we find?  About 20 people waiting for a table. It's like the employees were plucked out of a Walmart and told \"you're running a restaurant tonight...go!\"  If you must, get a to-go order.  If you don't have to, don't."}, {"review_id": "dsbE9fQDT17kxignZdoB2w", "user_id": "yl9OsZ6PA_lwGrse6aEtJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Truth be told, this place is way outside of my regular travel pattern so I visit quite infrequently. However, anytime the Mesa Center of Performing Arts has a show that I want to see, I make sure that I go early in order to grab a meal at this fine spot. Empanadas are like baked tacos or samosas or pasties depending on where you are from. They are filled with goodness and served with rice and beans. They are located in a cool mid-century building and have beer, wine, and cocktails. It's often very busy at meal time so plan to stand in line especially if there is a headliner at the Mesa Arts Center.

Plus, I don't get to eat empanadas very often. However, my husband and I were very disappointed in both the quality and value of the food. We ordered the El Capitan and Mushroom Chicken empanadas. If it weren't for the green sauce that they give you with them, they would've been way too bland for my taste buds. Also, we ordered a side of cabbage salad. It was not a SALAD! They just put some cabbage in a small bowl and charged $3.50 for something that probably costs 25 cents or less. No extra veggies, no dressing...just shredded cabbage.  We would have much rather bought another empanada for that price.On a brighter note, the sweet empanadas were much more tasteful. We got the Guava and Cheese & Dizzy Fig. Out of the two, we preferred the Dizzy Fig mainly because the guava one didn't have straight up guava in it, it was more like a jam. If you're gonna do that, then write \"Guava Jam and Cheese\" on the menu so that the customer isn't more disappointed when they fail to receive the fresh guava they were imagining and getting hungry for. It was still yummy, though. If you want to visit this place, I would skip the savory empanadas (the sweet ones are more worth it) and try something else...maybe it would be tastier??"}, {"review_id": "zbDiPkzNb0RRRyT5G8T8zw", "user_id": "2b8Vkgv9spPeCIvOekKRmw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I found this place on yelp a few days ago and was super excited to try it out.
