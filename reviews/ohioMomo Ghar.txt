Reading other Yelp reviews, I already know to expect that this is a small little store inside an international supermarket. However, I still found it hard to locate! Momo Ghar is located on the right side as soon as you walk in, right along the wall. It's a small little tent with brown \"bricks\" and some flags as decoration! Service - People here are friendly! I sat at the bar area by myself, and the staff is very friendly and started chatting with me! They also gave me recommendations on what to eat and what they're known for. If you didn't know yet, their dumplings/momos were featured on Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\"! Food - I ordered the Jhol Momo, and ate it all by myself! The sauce was what really set them apart from others. To be honest, the dumplings themselves tasted like the regular Asian dumplings I would get at the LA area. The spicy sauce though, it was amazing! I'm normally not the type to go for spicy food but I ended up using all my sauce! I also like that they cook to order, so I got to watch my dumplings being steamed right in front of me. Overall great experience, would love to come back again to try their other items on the menu!"}, {"review_id": "D4UauLTVnRfaflQ69z2S6w", "user_id": "YGlITSulOrR_cT_eEuaEVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "I will add my 5 stars for for Momo Ghar.

I order the pan fried noodles with pork which was easily enough for 2 people and was delicious.

Momo Ghar is a Himalayan/Nepalese eatery located within the confines of the Saraga International Market, which deserves (and hopefully with time and further visits from me) a review of it's own. More niche than full-on space, it can hold about a dozen folks or so comfortably before you begin the delicate diplomatic dance of staring at people eating waiting for a place to sit on your own. So budget your time and stay accordingly, or be prepared to get your food to go.Momo Ghar was the recipient of a visit from Mr. Guy Fieri of Food Network fame it seems, something I wasn't aware of until I visited. His signature sits in a place of pride adjacent to the Food Network logo in full view of all patrons. Pretty cool. The accolades are well-warranted too. The food is amazing. All of the various dumpling options, made by hand, are delicious and filling. I'm not sure who in their right mind wouldn't find the dumplings irresistible. The spices are intoxicating and offer a delicate balance of flavors both familiar and new to a freshly exposed palate. Even the plating is enticing. You want to dig in, and immediately. And they are filling. I myself partook of the the Choila Set, a Tibetan chicken salad with rice, potatoes and black-eyed peas is \"one of the most-unique dishes\" Guy has ever tried on his show. I quite liked it. They warned me it was a cold dish, but with the amount of heat put out by the spices, I still felt warm at the end. It really is a stunning dish.But I want to give a huge shout out to the guys who were manning the  place when I was there. They were patient, kind, and helped explain the food options and the ordering process. I'm somewhat hard of hearing to begin with, and combined with some broken English we made for a rather humorous exchange. But it all came out well in the end. Like I said, they were *very* patient with me, and man you have no idea how appreciated that is. It's a bit of a trek to get out here, but worth it. I definitely want to come back."}, {"review_id": "XcxfFxMYkKHkgDFuPxHihw", "user_id": "p-_xTXwwIEnUUO0ok7j_Sg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "being from India I'm a huge fan of momos so I naturally was drawn to this little joint while in Columbus. I definitely think the jhol momos were a highlight of this trip - they were flavorful and hot without being overly spicy and reminded me of Bengali sauces. The Tibetan pan fried dumplings were the usual and nothing to write home about but they were well made and delicious. I would have liked to try their chow mein or pan fried noodles but it seems those are no longer served which was a shame.

Momos are Tibetan dumplings, filled with meat or vegetables. We tried the chicken filled one and the pork, and they were both delectable. I was also happy that the spices and flavorings used in them were completely different. We chose to get them with the broth (you can order them dry), and this added a notable amount of heat, so spice-phobes beware. There are  only a couple of tables here as well as counter seating, and it filled up fast at dinner time; many people grab them to go when they're done with their shopping.

And unsurprisingly, they're difficult/non-existent to find in Dayton. (Here's where someone corrects me and tells me there's a gem we've been missing, right? Let me be hopeful!)Anyway, we ended up in Columbus the other day to seek out this restaurant. There was a crowd in front of it when we arrived, but realized there were many open bar seats. We squeezed through, sat down, and took in the atmosphere. ...true, the seating accommodations are smaller than typical chain restaurants, but it's not worth complaining about. Unless people are also standing between the tables and bar, it's not cramped.Sitting at the bar is recommended. There's something quite enjoyable about watching your dumplings being made, plated, and brought to you. Service is quick and effective. The main server/cashier was friendly. The other workers just seemed very focus on their tasks at hand.Anyway, to the part that matters most... The dumplings! We ordered the #1, #7, and #8. The #1 chicken dumplings were awesome. Not spicy in any way, but that sauce was sure packed with flavor! The chicken was also flavored very well and the cilantro in the dish tied everything together well. I admit, I used some of the garlic chili sauce that they provide on the side for an extra kick. (I wonder if you can order these spicy? I didn't ask though... I was still very satisfied with the dish). The #7 Alu dumplings were awesome as well. The inside filling shares many similar spices with the chicken dumplings, as well as vegetable and potato filling for a wonderful texture. The #8 vegetable fillings were delicious - not my favorite, but my boyfriend really enjoyed them. My two favorite were the chicken dumplings and the pan fried potato dumplings.My only slight compliant is how chilly it was sitting in the restaurant, but that didn't change how I felt about the food. These are definitely good dumplings, compared to the Dayton and Columbus areas. I've not tried other Nepal/Tibet inspired dumplings before, so I don't have a true basis of comparison... But again, for the Dayton and Columbus areas, definitely a 5 star restaurant.Recommended! And we'll be back to try some more menu items!"}, {"review_id": "phVOBcYD2H7TEMj8pZOvYQ", "user_id": "5ZNJYKz891fCwxIf75N7vw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Hidden gem in a grocery store, find them in the left back side of the store.

The johl momo were chicken filled steamed dumplings swimming in delicious spice soup. It was a first for me to eat a dumpling curry and definitely hit the spot especially during this cold weather. The Kothey were pan fried pork dumplings with spicy sauce on the side. It's not as doughey, pork flavor came through, and the  cold sauce complemented the hot dumplings.

It's definitely worth its reputation FORSURE. When I started getting into Yelp I heard about one of the best places on Yelp Columbus, If not THE best. So of course I had to try it. Especially since it was right down the street from my new job. They specialize in Momo's which I think means dumplings. I've never been a huge fan of dumplings but I had to give it a try. Of course I'll start with the food. And let me tell you, for such a small place, it has BIG taste. The flavors are amazing. I've never had Nepalese food before, so it was different for me. I first started with the number 1 on the menu. I believe it was chicken Momo with the Momo Ghar sauce/broth. It was so good. The textures was very nice, and the spiciness of the sauce mixed with the cilantro on top, and the flavors in the Momo's were spot on. I can't really describe it unless you try it yourself. My second dish was the number 5. Which was Pan seared pork Momo's. These were also very delicious. The texture in these are what made the dish, the softness of the dumpling mixed with the hard crunchiness of the pan seared side of the dumpling was very good. Add in the dipping sauce and you can't get better than that. The lady sitting next to me asked me which dish i liked better. It took me a long time to decide. Both were very good. However I did end up choosing number one because of the spicy Momo sauce they drowned it in was crazy good. The place is very very small. Its sits about 12 people. Maybe less. I lucked up and got the last spot at the bar table. This place is housed inside the Saraga food market. So it doesn't even have its own building. But don't let that scare you or anything like that. This place is legit and the food is something that you have to try.The servers don't speak too much English. However they are very very friendly and make sure you have what you need. Side note: the servers are also the cooks. You won't find better customer service anywhere, I promise. Overall this place is a MUST try. Especially if you are an adventurous foodie. You wont be disappointed. It's definitely an experience. Their reputation is definitely deserved. This small place serves food with Giant taste, hopefully we can see them at some point get their own full restaurant at some point. I'm happy that with Guy Fieri's show Diners Drive-ins and Dives, they will see the exposure they truly deserve."}, {"review_id": "xhypWWfwWU9JQCyY2PacLg", "user_id": "jX0cI0BnAdndw32Q87cp7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "OH MY GOODNESS!I would 100% argue that this is the best food in Ohio. Hands-down.For starters, the owners are the sweetest people ever. My first experience here was about a year ago and I was pleasantly and cheerfully greeted by one of them. He walked through the lengthy line, gathering people's ordered and giving an estimate on when their food would be done or a table would be ready. He was so excited for us to be there for the first time, experiencing their amazing food. I was a bit hesitant because my friend had built it up so much! She raved and raved about how good it was that I thought there's no way! Man did she prove me wrong!I ordered the #1 with a side of bread. It was warm and FULL of flavor! Somewhat spicy so if you don't like heat, definitely get the bread to tame that down... but honestly, you want the bread regardless. I even go as far as ordering extra sauce (because it's the best sauce ever). I would literally order it in bulk and cook everything in it.Now that I have gone on and on about the food, let me set the stage for you. This restaurant is inside of the international grocery store. There is plenty of parking, just be prepared to walk through the grocery store to find it. I recommend eating there to experience it, but you can also order carry-out. The store is generally busy and people are obviously shopping so it makes for a busy but fun experience. Go expecting a line but there won't always be one (and if there is one, it's worth the wait).Other notes, this place is vegetarian friendly."}, {"review_id": "f8xEytAaReEHLKirPfjz-Q", "user_id": "hWsAVahbGFPzeifdNV2WYQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "I write this review in fear of my life for all the love that momo gets. But I'll go ahead and say it anyway ~ I didn't think this spot was life changing. I mean it was good but I just don't understand the hype. First, the spot is really tiny. Thankfully we walked up and they had just opened so we scored a seat at the counter but the other 3 tables and two spots at the counter filed up at the same time and the line stayed 6 people deep at all times. So expect a wait to sit unless you're talking it to go. We ordered the number 1 and 5 so we could try both steamed and fried. I did like the fried ones but do belief they could have been fried just a bit more for a little more crunch. I also was IN LOVE with the sauce that came with the number 5. I could have drank that sauce. So good. The number one was just ok. The onion was so over powering that I almost couldn't taste anything else. And the sauce they were swimming in was ok but the sauce with number 5 blew me away so I was wishing for now of that. We got a side of bread which was over cooked but still yummy. overall I did enjoy and will go back but it wasn't the amazing over the top incredible dishes that I expected from the way everyone talks.

Slight update to previous review with added pictures:Momos were great this time. My mistake last time was definitely waiting too long before digging in, so make sure you start eating the momos immediately (anyone at your table who doesn't have food yet be damned) or they will get super mushy! I still think the sauce could be a leeetle spicier (especially given how cold it is inside Saraga, more heat would be welcome!), but I get that they want to cater the spice level to a wider audience and not cover up the other flavors.The chicken chhoila set -- this was delicious!! Every component was good, from the grilled chicken to the potato to the black-eyed peas to the rice. The alu dum (potato) was my favorite; the chura (flaky rice) I could've done without, but it did add a nice texture to the platter. Would recommend. Try the momos first bc that's what everyone comes here for, but def get the chicken chhoila platter next!Side note-- in keeping up with their popularity, they've raised their prices slightly: the momos are $9.50 now and the platter is $9.95. They also didn't have anyone behind the counter actively making and wrapping the momos so that entertainment aspect is gone, but I'm not sure if that's because it's the holiday season or bc they have to freeze larger batches now to keep up with demand."}, {"review_id": "shr-q8fgp4Y_U_V_rMFnJw", "user_id": "3xIZdXe0ZJSLnckt11pH6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "Upon moving to Columbus, I was told that the best dumplings in the Midwest were sold in a tiny Himalayan restaurant in the middle of a random grocery store.

We put in our order and our name and went exploring through the Asian food store - they have a wide variety of near and far eastern goods for sale. I will say this: the dumplings were absolutely worth the half hour wait and the cramped space. We got the Tibetan Momo and the Himalayan Momo. Both came with their sauce, which I would honestly drink on it's own (it's that good!). The spicy sauce that they have available is the perfect spice: it's hot and hurts you a little, but the flavor is balanced and delicious. I crave Momo Ghar when I am not in Columbus, and go out of the way for it when I am in Columbus. Sometimes when I'm eating mandu or jiaozi, I just get very sad that I am not eating momo from Momo Ghar.
