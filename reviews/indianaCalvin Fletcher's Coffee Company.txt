Calvin Fletcher's has some of the best prices I've seen around the city, while also keeping quality extremely high. During my first visit, the employees were extremely personable, friendly, and also provided recommendations for me. I ended up trying the ham and cheese croissant and the Calvin Pepper which were both amazing.The space is enormous and has a great vibe to it. There is plenty of seating, as well as books and games around as well. All the people I encountered there were extremely friendly and this atmosphere truly enhanced my experience! I could spend hours upon hours in Calvin Fletcher's.I can't wait 'til I have an opportunity to go back!"}, {"review_id": "OkCP68qThF84IysOKfXw8Q", "user_id": "JDZWR14Syz0mKjSN7-hBKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "I love this little place right in the heart of Fletcher Place. The staff is incredibly friendly and will always make sure you love your drink and food. I will second the previous reviews, their chai latte is AMAZING.The only reason I'm not giving this joint 5/5 stars is because of the lack of outlets around the tables. I know this is a total first world problem, but when I go to coffee shops I like to stay a while and work. I don't want to be limited based on my battery life."}, {"review_id": "TyqDeRH1zFHJtbeVDyotjA", "user_id": "2vFrtkBF6uy10ksMQT-o5g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "On a drizzly Saturday, Calvin Fletcher's provided the perfect spot to escape from the gloom and catch up with a good friend. Located in the bustling Fletcher Place neighborhood, Calvin Fletcher is the coffeehouse that you will want to make your own if you live nearby. Large plate-glass windows look out onto the street, and -- once you're inside -- there is a variety of different seats. Most of the tables seat 2-4, but you can also find overstuffed armchairs or large couches to plop down in. My friend and I headed up to the counter and each ordered a drink from the very friendly employee working at the till. They were out of the tea that I wanted that day, and after deliberating from a few different options that they told me about, I decided on a house decaf.  My house decaf arrived a few minutes later in a real mug (love that for when I stay to linger in a coffeehouse -- no extra pollution from disposable cups) and we settled in to chat and enjoy the place. Soft music played, students tapped quietly on their computers while they worked, and we enjoyed the welcoming, warm environment and the break from the day that the trip allowed. For your next escape from the ordinary (especially if its a dreary day) check out Calvin Fletcher to find your new favorite place!"}, {"review_id": "lqXWLw9j2vDFCqUT54CgGA", "user_id": "5kL_t1bDR4HLDq_xNo5KZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "GREAT ATMOSPHERE + GREAT COFFEE + SOLID VALUEI live next to Coat Check but still make my way to Calvin Fletcher every so often, its worth the drive and street parking. The coffee is great, the ambiance is crazy chill & the prices are very reasonable! Its also a non-profit so you feel good about spending your money here!Drinks: I have only gotten the Calvin Pepper, aka cappuccino with honey and pepper. You don't really notice the pepper much and it really works together well. You can also convince yourself you're being healthy because milk, honey and pepper are all good for you?Food: I have only gotten the ham and cheese croissant, its a hearty beast. They'll toast it for you and plate it, 10 minutes later you will be smiling, your fingers will be shiny and your stomach will be stuffed!"}, {"review_id": "Y843w-o4pwrW98YnUAX6sw", "user_id": "ku22MtUUexmvtzXKvJmt4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Peaceful, spacious, with good coffees and teas, and friendly service. Plenty of electrical outlets strips on the wall to plug into so one can get to work. Or there's comfy seating for an easy chat. Free street parking if you can find it. They do have premade sandwiches or pastries if hunger strikes. Best part is they're local and I've been happily coming here ever since I've turned into what feels like a forever student.

I had been wanting to try this place based on previous views and it did not disappoint!This is a spacious coffee shop with plenty of tables, as well as couches and chairs. It is very inviting! The staff were also quite pleasant!Today, I just opted for a cold brew. The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that the cold brew tasted too bitter. I tried to add some sugar to help, but the bitterness was too strong. I drank most of it and can say it was quite caffeinated!I will definitely return to this coffee shop, as I love the atmosphere and local feel. They do serve some pastries and sandwiches, as well! Next time I will try a different coffee.

Parking at times may be a little difficult, so if you have free time, ride a bike here by riding the Cultural Trail Route. But don't worry, there is plenty of seating inside and free WIFI! But if you're like me and like to read the local ads, magazines, and newspapers, this coffee shop sure has plenty of those. There is a lot of tasty coffee and tea options. I got the orange spice tea iced and it was super flavorful and VEGAN too. The barista brought the drink too me and it didn't take too long at all. They also had a vegan option of food in their refrigerated case! The pastries that were displayed looked very tasty as well. Everything was reasonably priced in my option and the service was great!"}, {"review_id": "FG8vpLed6M2Jh1w-lDvLZQ", "user_id": "RVl4wNUwiOHN79rzvld5XA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "Possibly the best mocha I've ever had.

There's definitely a strong community feel to this shop, with neighborhood residents chatting away with one another and families out for a bite before starting their day. I took a book, sat to sip my coffee, and did a little people watching. The staff was super friendly. I look forward to going back, hopefully before all the pastries are out!

Calvin Fletcher Coffee Co. is down-to-earth, friendly, and inviting. Beyond their exceptional customer service, they have great coffee and an extensive menu selection of hot, iced, and flavored drinks. I always come hungry because they offer lots of yummy breakfast options from fruit and yogurt parfaits to locally made scones & muffins by Circle City Sweets. There's also plenty of seating and outlets if you've got work to do. This place is a staple in the Fletcher Place neighborhood and exudes a sense of community in the warmest, fuzziest way. Oh, did I mention it's a not-for-profit and they even donate their tips to a different local charity each month? Though I could rave about this place all day,  I've got to cut myself off somewhere.

Plenty of seating, free street parking, cheap coffee AND a strong sense of community? It doesn't get much better than that. CF's is a nonprofit so this is the cheapest coffee in town, but with good quality and options (they have 3 drip coffees to choose from). Plus, only $0.50 for coffee refills! The staff is very friendly and helpful and that rubs off on the customers. If they are busy, don't be afraid to ask someone to share a table. You also can sit here for hours without being bothered or feeling rushed out. Don't be afraid if the line is long when you come in.
