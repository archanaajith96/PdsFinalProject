Now, I'm so picky with Mexican food (I've told y'all why) so I've never been to Babalu's. For $2, why not? Even though I already have been to Sugar's, I had to order some tacos. I'm so glad I did!1st taco I ordered was the pork belly. This was my favorite. When I tell you that it was phenomenal, I'm not kidding! An explosion of all the right flavors having a whole party!2nd Taco was the pork taco. It was really good, nice smokey flavor. 3rd Taco was the chicken taco. Again, this one was great too. Bold flavors, big pieces of chicken, and this one was creamier than the others. Which worked perfectly.4th was the short rib taco. I thought this would be my favorite because I live for short ribs! But it was my least favorite. When paired with the other tacos. It lacked flavor. If you ordered it alone, it'd be fine. But combining with the bold flavors of the other tacos. It gets lost and muddled.Overall about the tacos. Each taco held its own weight. They were all totally different which I greatly appreciate. They are made with a white corn tortilla. Which, I'm not a fan of corn tortillas at all, but yellow corn tortillas I despise. So these were ok for me. But everyone has their own preference when it comes to tortillas. I'd definitely order those top 3 at least once a week. Yeah, they are that good. We sat on the patio and it was a very perfect day for it too! Our server AJ was absolutely great and attentive. He knew it was my first time and made me feel comfortable. The kitchen made an error and gave Rachel 2 extra tacos, but no problem. They just told her happy eating! He also told us that Monday through Friday they have social hour from 3-6. They have special menus for tasting tapa plates that include non menu items. Drink specials including $4 Sangria, and $3 tacos (any taco). I will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "pNTY6F3Jxhh1EK7zXAbg0A", "user_id": "blmhs-oe2hFno612IiBoTQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Brunch, lunch or dinner, Babalu's is a fun atmosphere.  Bottomless mimosas, made at the table guacamole,  and nostalgic movies playing on the wall are sure to get your celebration started.Colorful umbrellas provide shade to the patio patrons but arrive early or you'll be like me and miss out.  I must admit that the construction going on next door was a little distracting, but it didn't damper the vibe coming from the patio.  Large groups and small were enjoying the beautiful weather.Our group shared the made at the table guacamole and it was fresh and delicious.  Our redfish tacos had just the right amount of spice and they didn't last long.  I wasn't brave enough to try the bottomless mimosa, but I did try a pineapple one!So, if you're in Jackson, MS, and looking for a fun place, head on over to Babalu Tacos and Tapas, I think you'll be glad you did.  And tell them that Travel and Table sent you!"}, {"review_id": "1oLETLreiTtmZ31tEQVpPw", "user_id": "43pL-QN8I-rz3sB8Bn1z-g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The 2nd time was just as good as the 1st! But I was disappointed that they didn't have any fierce shimp available. Taylor was our waitress. Nice young lady but not as talkative as Tracie was during our last visit. This is simply the perfect place to relax and enjoy some good food. If possible wait for an outside table. It should be a crime how good that guacamole dip is. Having jalapenos added gives it a whole new taste.

They certainly made my experience THAT much better and made me feel right at home with their southern hospitality and smiling faces. We arrived around 12:30pm on a rainy Friday and the place was surprisingly packed so we decided to sit at the bar, which worked out perfectly! I started off with their strawberry Martinez cocktail which was fantastic! I love how it was served in a large martini glass. No ice, not too strong, and the right about of sweet. Highly recommended. For food we quickly put in an order of fresh guacamole and chips (veggies is also an option). The guy brought around a cart behind us and made the guac exactly to our liking which was awesome. After that I ordered some tuna tacos (tacos are 3 for $9 if you order the same type, otherwise they charge you by the taco). In any case, my tacos were fabulous. My date ordered the spice seared tuna sandwich which came with bacon, arugula, cucumbers and aioli on sourdough bread. It was delicious! We also ordered a small broccolini with goat cheese on the side. She kept telling us we wanted to do a large order of this rather than a small and I saw why after we got it, but a small was fine for us. We left happily satisfied. Overall, nice ambiance, good food and a friendly mixed crowd of business people, families, those on dates, and friends hanging out."}, {"review_id": "KEYDMBFaHTSsWJ-43m6TOg", "user_id": "T68PUOXE8kzjsDQbOYjjbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Do I hear Taco Tuesday?! I mean, if you want a taco with a unique spin on traditional tacos, Babalus is hard to beat on this day. Any tacos on their menu is $2 on taco Tuesdays, all day! (Redfish, tuna, shrimp included). Every taco has it's own different sauces and toppings, so it's not like you have the same taco but just with a different protein. My mouth was in flavor town and texture town! They had the option of fried, grilled or blackened, so even with my proteins, I can have it several ways!Put server AJ did an amazing job, attentive (but not over bearing), personable, knew every menu quite well and even told us about the new happy hour options! Below are the taco menu and happy hour 3pm-6pm menu."}, {"review_id": "5cydMqGyphGvFE91JbrEjQ", "user_id": "FxBfuhlJuEljR37RpuDhjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "I am in complete shock that a restaurant like this exists in Jackson, MS. I've lived in the sip for 6 1/2 years without Yelp and not knowing of restaurants like this.My mum was pretty skeptical about trying this restaurant since she grew up in Jackson and figured a place like this wouldn't exist.Now, the service is top-notch and the food is amazing! I ordered the house-made black bean burger and it was so dang delicious, every time I think of the sip this restaurant pops up in my mind. The fact that they make their black bean patties from scratch and don't rely on Morning Star, Boca, or the rest of them frozen microwavable patties hit me in a good spot in my heart.Thick rich patty with argula on a soft sweet bun, yum! My mum got the fish tacos, she enjoyed the taste, but wished they would have cut the fish to fit into the tortilla. Our server was bomb as well. Now, I just need to get back down to Jax so I can eat some more of this delicious food!"}, {"review_id": "NaS5QfaXUxLgRKtphUetlA", "user_id": "iRnhYH2G_IxC0khDeMgO1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Babalu is my favorite restaurant in Fondren!

I teetered back and forth as to whether to go with 4 or 5 stars. I would say this is a strong and solid 4 star restaurant all day long. The atmosphere and food were fantastic. The guacamole is definitely almost worth the 5 star rating all by itself. You HAVE to try it. The beer selection is pretty good and if you go during \"Social Hour\", then the prices are great. $1 off beers and $2 tacos. The tacos were all I had tonight and they were each really great. I think the size is pretty small but at $2, who can complain. Overall, what I could not overlook in my rating was the service. Like I said, a solid 4 star rating all day but our waiter was spectacular and was very enthusiastic.

We were able to snag outdoor seating shortly before the sun set on Easter Vigil. Our server was fun and friendly. The unique patio furniture we sat on was paired with low tables making eating quite awkward and uncomfortable.The fresh guacamole we started off with was entertaining (they prepare it in front of you) and delicious, but was unfortunately the highlight of the meal. The chips first brought out must have been left over from the night before and hardly seemed fresh-baked, however, a second serving upon request was superb.We tried the tapas this time. The pan seared crab cakes didn't disappoint, but did not impress either. I'd say the albondigas (meatballs) were quite good. The short rib was tough and the group collectively disliked them. Don't bother trying them. Overall they seem to be worth their price during happy hour only.They were out of a local brew (SoPro MS Fire Ant) which I was eager to try, so I tried a mojarita that was weak and too sour instead.I've heard only good things before this experience, so I'll be back to try tacos and cervezas and make up for this slightly below average adventure, but let my review be very specific and not a general guide."}, {"review_id": "sssVqdKu-reLUBR4n3-z4Q", "user_id": "u8F7vszrS1P8RopNos2mhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Awesome service and delicious food.

I say official because about a 3 or so weeks ago I came Sat afternoon to celebrate a friend's bday. Despite my previous visit with friends, I still recommended Babalu's because I wanted to believe a 1 time bad experience should not determine your entire outlook of a restaurant. My friend wanted a place where she could try new food, sit outside, have amazing drinks, and be in an overall nice & fun setting ... Babalus turned out to be the perfect pick.  We celebrated in true Babalu style & ordered as many things from the menu to share. We ate the queso dip (my friend's favorite item), black eyed hummus (my favorite),garlic potatoes ( I recommend everybody trying at least once)  & almost every taco on the menu... despite the small plates we left full and satisfied. The waiter was knowledgeable, helpful & quite clean. The manager on duty stopped by and greeted us with kind words. As far as my trip yesterday (lol finally) I decided to dine at the bar. The bartenders had high energy and fun, friendly attitudes. They help create an environment that made all the guests at the bar want to join in on the fun. We enjoyed $2 tacos (pork & chicken) & I tried the Babalu Burger for the first time & fell in love. Previously I had the veggie burger which is def one of THEE best in the city but the Baba Burger may be Jackson's # 1 Burger! I'm grateful that Babalu's reached out & cared about their customer's concerns... I felt like not only was my opinion valued but my concerns were addressed. Looking forward to more return trips. Thank you :)"}, {"review_id": "MDWhHJwmXgAvP2-d3k67OA", "user_id": "AVL4m7GsveQp50u7-h4kpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I wrote a poor review concerning the timeliness of service.
