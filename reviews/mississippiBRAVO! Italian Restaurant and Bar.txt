It had a live vibe with full house of people. Feels upscale but not overdone.Service: our servers name was Lauren and she was just over the top great. She knew everything on the menu and not only that but with her descriptions made us want everything! Everything came out as ordered and in good time. The special 5 star moment came at the end after we had paid and were just hanging out talking, she brought out a dessert for us saying it was on her since this was a night out free from kids and she wanted us to enjoy it and make it extra special.Food: we got pizza, pasta, salads, and appetizer and everything was great. All the cheeses were so good in everything. If there was one minor thing I would point at was the ravioli we ordered (which was the days special) came with peas and they just seemed to overwhelm the rest of the food. I am not a huge fan of peas so this could easily be more of a me problem but my wife agreed and she likes them. But overall everything was excellent and we had a great time and again a big thanks to Lauren fo making us feel special"}, {"review_id": "VhfLc1Kv5cooZVvoM9wysQ", "user_id": "95z6HhgE4C9fKhhKyXmDLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Breakfast pizza Béchamel, bacon, caramelized onions, and eggs.  (Omitted Italian sausage)Food: 5Atmosphere: to goService: 10, as always.Jeff E Good is the owner and an absolute gem!

Not only do they offer a wide range of foods to try for only $5 but I enjoyed their Pinot Noir for the same price. The bartender, Chris, was hilarious and knowledgeable, and I truly enjoyed the small talk we had w him. The experience def made me not only invite more friends to come but already planning on a return visit in the near future. I enjoyed my sample plate w meats, veggies & cheese... which was the perfect combo to my wine.

One of the finest elite Italian restaurants in the city. It is one of those Jackson staples. The service has always been amazing on every visit. and their wine selection is great as well. I have been addicted to their Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken for years. The sauce has a nutmeg flavor that is perfect.  The creme brulee is beyond words. It is the best way to top off an indulgent meal here. I must say kudos to the chef(s) that have maintained keeping this restaurant in my top 5 in the city on taste for over 20 + years. If you have not visited Bravo! in awhile I suggest you return to be reintroduced to what Jackson has to offer from a seasoned restaurant. Its located in Highland Village upstairs right off the highway (I-55N). Actually, as I am writing this I am wanting to return- maybe tomorrow. I hope my trainer forgives me!"}, {"review_id": "P01A8a-PBpadqOsTgM4O1g", "user_id": "Zw_bMaOcP778BNi8CIT1zA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2017", "text": "Absolutely wonderful!

The wait staff looks much more contemporary in the soft grays than the old black jackets. The menu philosophy  is still the same, some of the old dishes that I love are still there, like the duck breast with fig/Marsala reduction. The wine list has a print date on it which I like. Helps keep track if new wines are on the list. I am amazed that they have Melville wine. It's a boutique winery in Santa Barbera and they're pinots are top notch. Well done, Jeff and Dan!

Friendly service, great atmosphere, and world-class food make BRAVO! a must for anyone traveling through Jackson or local to the area. To start, you are always greeted with a smile by the wonderful hosts and hostesses as soon as you enter the restaurant. BRAVO! Has had some of the most consistent, outgoing, and friendly staff I've ever experienced. Through my many many times dining there, servers have learned my name, preferences, and often know what I want before I do. It's no surprise that BRAVO! has some of the lowest turnover in the area. Tanya and Patrick do a fantastic job of running a tight front-of-house experience, and always get the job done right.The menu is filled with old favorites and new additions that anyone can enjoy. From a delectable fillet to their signature lasagna, I have never had a bad dish. Everything is impeccably prepared and beautifully plated. My favorites include the sweet potato and chicken salad, the crab cakes and truffled polenta, and the NY Strip with black pepper and honey jus. The food is all very accessible and doesn't need esoteric ingredient or odd combinations to stand on its own. For those looking for more casual options, the wood fired pizzas are always a great choice. I've personally had several dinners comprised of \"apps and zerts\" with the Antipasto plate and herbed flatbread and hummus taking the spotlight, and following up with a great selection of wine and the always delectable creme brûlée and rich chocolate torte to finish the night.Speaking of wine, I've never seen a more robust wine menu anywhere in Jackson. The menu is pages upon pages long, but the excellent staff make navigating the multi page menu effortless. If you're in the mood for something stronger, the BRAVO! Bar is always well stocked and the seasonal cocktail menus provide fresh takes on old classics. And if you don't see your favorite on the menu, you can ask the team behind the bar - there's not a drink they can't make. Bottom line: if you want the best dining experience in Jackson - make BRAVO! Your next stop."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bravo-italian-restaurant-and-bar-jackson-3?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
