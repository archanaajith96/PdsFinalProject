We stopped in here for a quick lunch while we were out doing the children's museum. It was a couple miles from there and so our decision to eat here was based on proximity, and it seemed kid friendly based on the menu. We loved It! My favorite part was the crust. It was a nice surprise that it was sprinkled with seasoning (garlic salt?). So Good! We had the veggie pizza and the BBQ chicken. Also had the gigantic meatball, which came with some garlic buttered crostini~ nom! You can see the wood fire oven in the restaurant, which is a cool touch to watch the chef cook it. My daughter thought it was fun! Ive also had brick oven pizza before, when i was living in Boston, and foud that the crust can often get burnt. But not at Woodfire, It was cooked perfectly with no black spots. We live out of town, otherwise I would be back again!"}, {"review_id": "aTvWRX6P6ja9CltFukLVBQ", "user_id": "QS08OZddNzh4vtJcCmqwDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Pizza is always as amazing as the very first time you have it.

I've also had their bbq chicken pizza before (pictured below) and I'm not sure what the other one pictured below was called, but it looks like it had sausage and jalapeños on it. For appetizers, the meatball and bruschetta is pretty good.

This place is DELICIOUS!!! There brick oven pizza by far is the BEST in town!  I've never had a pizza, whether I eat it at the Anderson Japanese Garden, the city market, or at the restaurant.My buddies and I couldn't really decide what to get so we went with a surf and turf theme by getting the steak pizza and the lobster pizza. Boy did we choose correctly. The combination was great and I would choose the two in a heart beat. Overall, the pizza is ahead of its time in this town."}, {"review_id": "_Sqa8Qr4Zb75_UboXC0iaA", "user_id": "kWkWS3GPd7bmmOpa5BTnbw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "I'm really disappointed to be giving Woodfire Pizza such a bad review. The pizza is usually so good, and I was really excited when my coworkers and I decided to place an order for lunch. However, when my coworker went to pick up our food, she was immediately met with a snotty attitude. The employees were irritated with the fact that we placed several orders and wanted to pay with different cards. It should have been no different than if we all called and ordered separate pizzas. We were told that next time we would need to place a catering order 24 hours in advance.  Then, when the pizzas arrived back at our office, most looked good but one of them was completely burnt on the bottom. The pizza tasted horrible because it was burnt. When we tried to call the restaurant to have the situation rectified, we once again had to speak with a rude employee. She was annoyed with the fact that we were asking for a refund (for just the one pizza) over the phone, and told us that this was not possible. She said she would set aside a coupon in my coworkers name for a free pizza, but that they \"wouldn't hold on to it forever\" so they needed her to come pick up her coupon soon.  Overall we were all very disappointed with the service mainly, and one of the pizzas. You would think they would be happy to be getting our business (as we spent over $100 combined) but instead they seemed to be annoyed.  Not sure whether or not any of us will be returning, even for a free pizza!"}, {"review_id": "cQkwTqApfUX6k64baTG6oA", "user_id": "mIylP5D9ma1gYwwS4AAgCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/6/2017", "text": "This place is neat. It's a cross between a classic wood fire place and a more modern one.The sausage is the way to go they have great sausage pizzas. The lobster and shrimp pizzas are also very good. The pizzas themselves are well cooked and the crust is wonderful. Also the best gluten free pizzas in town.What hangs me up is the pepperoni, they just aren't very flavorful. I love a pepperoni and sausage pizza and it just kind of feels lacking.Can't knock the service at all, it's always been wonderful, and the place is all around a very good restaurant I do enjoy going there, but I can't get over the lacking pepperoni."}, {"review_id": "GAmreEQZsnf8HFwm5cEzyA", "user_id": "CP9DKshA2CXajXdH-vvb2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Hands down best pizza in Rockford.

Even though they were getting ready to close one of the waitresses welcomed us and told us that the kitchen was close but we could still order a pizza. Most of the tables had chairs on them but she found us a table. Got one sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese pizza and it was delicious. The pizza came out very quickly and was perfectly done. Thank you to our waitress and the pizza chef for feeding us so late and right before closing.

It was really packed when we went and it was a little difficult to get our order in with so many people waiting for a seat. The wait staff & hostess definitely seemed a little overwhelmed (but still polite). We got the Sausage, Rapini, and Ricotta pizza and it was quite good. The pizza had a nice crust, lots of cheese, and a whole lot of sausage! However, it is definitely a little overpriced. After tax, I paid around $16 and it was definitely not a huge pizza. I think one person could eat it by themselves if they were pretty hungry. Also, we saw some reviews splitting pizzas half-half and we wanted to do that with ours. It turns out you can only do that with the non-specialty pizzas like cheese & pepperoni which is understandable. Just a tip so you don't get excited about trying two types of pizza for the same price like we were!"}, {"review_id": "jpOcw2QDa8-7q_R-gLXGPA", "user_id": "9c6KMba_Zyjc-b1migrLGw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/20/2016", "text": "This is a pretty good pizza place! I have to say, it's definitely on the fancy side of pizza and my perspective on the pizza industry as a whole is that it shouldn't really be that fancy, but Woodfire does a pretty good job. The table was definitely a little small for the three of us and two pizzas, but the trays the pizzas were put on helped a little. As for the namesake of the restaurant, I didn't notice that much of a difference between the pizza they served versus other pizzas I have had, at least in terms of cooking quality or added flavor through the woodfire brick oven. The ingredients and care taken to assemble were definitely of a higher caliber than average, so I have to commend Woodfire for that portion of the meal!We also ordered garlic truffle fries, but from this experience I think I learned not to order them again. They really weren't all that good.I don't think I'll personally be going back here again as there are many other places in Rockford I'd like to try out, but I suppose I wouldn't completely dissuade people from trying it out."}, {"review_id": "ZCWZOQ64fARQ5O1UbgMYiQ", "user_id": "jFgrPqkwi0AIN5OPnY3Wrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Birthday dinner for family member, with 2 teenagers. Everyone had a different pizza: pepperoni, breakfast, basil, chicken ranch and buffalo chicken. All very tasty, plenty to share and lots to take home. I had a wedge salad which was wonderful as I had not experienced balsamic combined with blue cheese! It was great! Also the giant meatball and roasted veggies fondue apps were a hit. Great ambiance, love the old brick walls and watching the pizzas made in the stone oven. Only downside for me is the parking. We will be back to try some pasta, and those desserts!!"}, {"review_id": "va-w1Cbc1HMmI1fFhZFvTQ", "user_id": "ZamX9bsjdefOXS3raKwldQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/16/2017", "text": "The wife and I went here for lunch today after our biweekly shopping trip. Excellent service and food.  Our appetizer ended up taking a bit longer then it should have because the chef had to open a new leg of prosciutto and shave the meat from that.  Our waitress was kind enough to let us know the reason for the delay and apologized for the delay.  She was very kind and took good care of us.    The app consisted of shaved prosciutto, 2 kinds of cheeses, arugula dressed in balsamic vinegar, honey comb, nuts and raisins. Our entrees were Margarita pizza and huge double pork and beef meat ball sandwich with truffle fries that were fried in duck fat.  Dessert consisted of a beautifully presented Tiramisu for TWO.  Also included in the price of $75.38 was a good size glass of red wine, a diet soda, a Madagascar vanilla cappuccino and an espresso.  All of the food was perfectly prepared and beyond delicious.  The wife and I have a new favorite restaurant."}, {"review_id": "rZ3lu-zUejMNew7oOrR9KA", "user_id": "hKbsrO1EIAGF0eM8siX4qg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/29/2017", "text": "We ordered a half spinach, half sausage pizza.

That covers the bad stuff. The pizza was very good, the service was good and our server gave us a 1/2 off on next pizza order coupon, which we will use. We ordered the Tuscan fire as an appetizer and they were fantastic. We will go back and give them another chance to dazzle us.Well, we went back for a second chance. This time was a home run. Monday night \"happy hour\" on a couple of appetizers and a few drinks.

We've always wanted to try this place out so we stopped in for a bite to eat. The atmosphere is great. I really like the way the place is laid out. We decided to shared the bbq chicken pizza & some Tuscan fries. When we got the fries, they were so salty to the point where you couldn't eat 1 strand of it without having to a huge amount of water just to wash it down. It got sent back & we got a fresh new order of fries which came out so much better than the first! Haha. The fries were very good, I enjoyed those. As far as the pizza goes, I was not impressed. I felt like it didn't have too much flavor to it. It literally tasted like chicken smothered in bbq sauce on top of cooked dough. Maybe it wasn't the best choice of pizza but I'd definitely give it another shot & go back to try something different."}, {"review_id": "vkZIJUEUXP5Oap1rC8e4YA", "user_id": "qBVhPBidruQhNiRg-HiwZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2017", "text": "We are from out of town and wanted to try some good local pizza.
