It's hard to make good ribs at a larger production scale because you have to sacrifice cooking time. Had both the baby back ribs and the spare ribs, some of the meat was a little chewy and dry but for the most part they were good. I think that they keep the ribs in the smoker past when they're done to keep them heated which leads to the ends getting dry. Will definitely come back though since I don't have a place where I can have a wood grill anymore."}, {"review_id": "DZQvmoSbne4q9mDbLqF2tQ", "user_id": "0UJIRuenU3aOCTLfcHt7xQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This weekend & all day at Maxtown, free barbecue pork sandwich with suggested donation to go to the families of the fallen Westerville officers.

My favorite is the beef brisket sandwich. The beef is not too fatty, sweet, and  perfectly cooked. I am usually not a fan of bbq food, but Ray Ray's is an exception. I recommend going close to opening time if you can, since the line can get quite long. There is a patio seating area there as well,  so you can relax and enjoy your food while it's still hot :)"}, {"review_id": "2O34UAoWa2hyYJC_rZz79Q", "user_id": "Jv1N4dr8Auo5PtssZZF5jA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Visiting friend in Columbus.

Driving there i kept missing the parking lot (my fault for not listening to GPS) I must have circled the block like 3 times acknowledging that the truck was parked n the parking lot at a local bar like a dummy. I finally parked behind the actual parking lot and walked up. Luckily, there wasn't a long line at 6pm and the line moved swiftly.I noticed that once you've ordered your meal they wait until they complete your order before taking the next person in line (probably due to them having one window instead of a order and pick up window) regardless of this the wait was really short in between orders.Food review:I ordered the 3 st louis style ribs with spicy dry rub, 1lb of beef brisket and a small baked beans. The spicy dry rub on the ribs tasted amazing! Packed full of flavor with a small hint of heat it was a dry rub that was really well done however, the ribs wasn't fall of the bone as I liked and could of been smoked a little longer actually, i cant tell if it started as a smoked rib or cooked first, the bark didn't seem too apparent and he meat didnt shrink to exposet he ends of the rib bones like good smoked ribs do.The brisket though, the brisket was smoked perfectly was a sexy bark that was really flavorful and leaving a really flavorful and tender piece of meat. Bite after bite I just couldn't get enough of the brisket it was definitely the highlight and deserved a 4 star on it's own. The bark had the perfect smokey flavor with a great texture when you bite into it with the meat meat being smoked so well it kind of just melts in your mouth, no sauce needed.I did regret getting the baked beans. Upon opening it, it looked really legit with pieces of pork in there and good coloring, until i took my first bite into it. This side dish is so.... sweet i just couldn't take anymore bites after the second one. The sweetness overpowered everything that could have made this side dish really good.End of food review.The staff were friendly and the guy who gave me my order even double checked to make sure I got everything I ordered without me asking. The spicy dry rub was perfect in flavor and a nice kick although the ribs could have been smoked longer. The thing to get in my opinion is the brisket and could be one of the best one i've had. Avoid the baked beans as I should have followed everyone else and got the coleslaw (these two were the only available items at the time I went; I waned to get the collard greens but no avail.). The concept is really cool that you have a truck and outside displays 2 smokers and 2 grills to cook the chicken. The smell in the air sends brain waves of deliciousness."}, {"review_id": "27XNZwK9VeyaheKHqKJZDg", "user_id": "1hzn3t7vXinleAv7XQdwNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "You can't go wrong here!

After stopping in last night and ordering the burnt ends sandwich with peppers & onions I immediately understood why this Clintonville BBQ joint is so well-loved. The burnt ends were seasoned and smoked to perfection and the combination of the sautéed vegetables and BBQ sauce gave the sandwich a great balance. We also got the Mac N Cheese and Collard Greens as sides, and although they weren't on the same level as the BBQ, they were still great. Add in the fact that this tasty sandwich was well priced and Ace of Cups next door serves beer on their patio and you've got a winning combination.

Their baked beans are pretty good, and I like their coleslaw. The grass fed brisket is quite fatty - due to this, it melts in your mouth. The brisket isn't as tender as the grass fed one because of the far ratio being lower. The sauces are great - I didn't find the ribs spectacular.

We've been looking for good BBQ ever since we got here and I guess we will keep on looking. I ordered a brisket sandwich with baked beans on the side and asked for the carolina vinegar sauce. What I got was brisket covered with a thick, sweet, sticky brown sauce. That totally ruined what was actually decent brisket, not great but decent. I hope that's not really their carolina vinegar sauce. They really need to offer a mustard-based sauce for brisket, if they can get your order right. The beans tasted just like that brown sauce. I could not eat them. The rest of the day I was extremely thirsty and kept burping up that sauce. Oh, how I miss real southern BBQ!"}, {"review_id": "Cbu4CKDvrZdkIBCtli9m2A", "user_id": "WaX8ol-TsI6Yf44Ewp62tg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "It is so freaking good!
