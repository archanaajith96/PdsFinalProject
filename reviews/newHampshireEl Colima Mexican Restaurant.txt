Ordered a margarita tower which was pretty watered down with a hint of tequila but I don't expect much when ordering things like that. Ordered table side guacamole which came fast but was bland. We ordered food ranging from tacos, enchiladas and fajitas. That's when our mediocre experience became a bad experience. We waited over an hour for our food and it was all cold except for the fajitas which came on hot skillets. We never got tortillas for the fajitas. The food also came in spurts so 2 people received their food at a time and by the time the last 2 people received their food the first 2 were done eating. When the check came that is when it became a  an annoying experience to the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my life. The manager came over and we told him that we were a little bummed we had to wait so long for our food. Instead of simply apologizing, he tried to blame us for not letting him aware of the situation sooner or letting the waitress know. We did ask the waitress how long our food would be after about a half hour, which she told us 5-10 minutes and ended up being 20 minutes. He also kept talking over us to tell us they make all dishes fresh (even though it was cold).Long story short, I'll take La'caretta or Margarita's premade food any day."}, {"review_id": "IKLJPbvmqXykFvWa7z0RRw", "user_id": "pRJhD8XWwVEAySDCllt6bA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "I never thought I would give this restaurant any rating other than 5 stars but I totally agree with Joe S.  Our first visit to El Colima was to their tiny old building and we absolutely loved the variety of their menu as well as the  flavor and consistency of their food and their attention to detail.  After moving into the new building it seemed as if they never missed a beat and we happily drove 20+ miles for lunch once or twice a month.  Unfortunately this restaurant has steadily gone downhill during 2017.  The food is inconsistent, the bartenders are self absorbed and inattentive, and the restaurant's lost the attention to detail that made them so special.  As a result, we've only been here a couple times in the last three months.The impact of good management talent is not over-rated and my sense is that it is something sorely lacking at El Colima.  I believe the root of their problem is that they opened their new restaurant in Manchester earlier this year and as a result they diluted their talent and ultimately took their eye off of the ball in Nashua.  I truly hope they address this situation before it's too late because when this restaurant is running well I don't think it can be beat.In the meantime, we were fortunate to find Cazadores in Tyngsboro, a wonderful Mexican restaurant that offers everything we loved about El Colima, and we'll be getting our Mexican food fix there until El Colima cleans up their act."}, {"review_id": "_FVd3cOPihfOXVTnZDxTTA", "user_id": "sQAGS647b3QHNoK82DEHpA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Terrible ownership from this place!

Poured it in the same type of glass the god damn glass overflowed! On top of that he had the nerve to charge us $12 dollars! Even after I said I was dissatisfied and to take it off the bill! Then he told the waitress that if we did not pay for the drink it comes out of her pay! How in the world do you run a business like that? On top of the fact that no one but the Manager spoke English.

Wife and I decided we'd go somewhere else as the service was already telling me this was going to be a bad time. Got the bill. Imagine my surprise when I saw this trash place charges $1 more for \"lime\". I said to the bartender, very politely I might add, \"Excuse me, did you charge me for a lime in my drink?\" She explained that they use real lime juice and not sour mix there, and that while some places factor this cost into the price listed on the menu, they don't. Wait, what? So other restaurants are transparent about the price of their drinks while, unbeknownst to the customer, you're tacking on $1 charge per margarita.To be clear, it's not like I asked for fresh lime juice instead of sour mix, or that there was any sort of choice listed on the menu for the same. This place is just making their drinks look like they're one price while tacking on another $1, presumably, hoping you won't notice. If the drink is going to cost me $8.75, put that price on the menu. It's no different than ordering a cheeseburger for, say, $11 (as listed on the menu), but getting the bill and seeing it's $18 because they actually use Kobe beef; why wouldn't you just say that, unless you're trying to screw your customer?It's not the $1 that's the issue, its the extremely unethical and maybe illegal practice they have going on there. I'd pay $8.75 for a margarita; it's the idea that they're dishonestly sneaking that charge in that's troubling. Won't go there again."}, {"review_id": "Ymieok-ajsvZdh5LZlho8g", "user_id": "nSxJTkDUB4xthWLDRAw6Lw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "I ordered Carne Asada which was rib eye steak entree with rice, salsa and tortilla.

Went with 6 people before a concert. Sat at the bar. Drinks were weak and you'd think for $13 for a margarita it would be better. The menu was on a tiny piece of Paper with the descriptions of the items and you marked what you wanted with a pencil. 3 of us ordered fajitas and 2 had some kind of rib eye dish. That was the worst the rib eye was so thin you looked the the bottom of a shoe and was like shoe leather. Our food all came out  sporadically. Took 15 minutes and asking 2 waitresses to get the tortillas that went with 5 of the meals. Asked for our bills and my husband and mine had a beer on it we didn't get and a cheese sauce I order and never got. Also had to pay 1.50 for some sour cream I asked for with my $14 enchiladas.

First, let me start with the positive. Our waitress was super nice - so this shouldn't reflect on her. First, we were sat without silverware. No biggie. I ask the hostess for silverware, who looked at me like I was insane for asking. Finally got my silverware.The drinks - mine was ok, my husbands was sickeningly sweet. I got the cucumber maragarita and he got the house.We then ordered our food. Queso fundido to start and we both ordered fajitas as our entrees. We got the cheese dip within a minute - no shocker there and we were appreciative. And then two minutes later (NOT exaggerating) our fajitas came out. My jaw dropped. Our entrees were served 3 minutes after we ordered them. I've had to wait longer at Taco Bell! Now I could have forgiven this absurdity if the food was good but it was mediocre at best. Obviously it was just sitting waiting to be quick heated (hence the turnaround time). The meat was cooked to death and chewy, the peppers were raw and nothing had any flavor.We spent 26 minutes here and our bill was 78 dollars. Never. Ever.
