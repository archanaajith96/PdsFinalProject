I don't really know. This place is just amazing.Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.So what do you look for in a cafe? Is it a place to feel at home? To feel alive? To spend time with a good friend? To feel comfortable and get some work done? To get treated with hospitality and care and love?From the chalkboard sign out front, with a colorful chalky encouragement to a fresh mix of colors inside, to the glistening, condensating, singing cold press juices that greet you as you approach the counter, there really is nothing like coming to Ashker's in Buffalo. Some places you walk into and just feel more at peace, more at home, more ready and in love with life. Ashker's is that place. Where would like to meet? This is one of the most welcoming, jolly places and is full of color.Well, the food, it's fresh. It's made to order, it makes you happy. You feel good leaving and you feel as if you were just somewhere beautiful. Because you were!!If you want to saunter down to Ashker's Blackrock they have a new location there! One thing definitely worth mentioning is how nice their staff are at both places and definitely at Ashkers Blackrock. Friendliness and smiles and rainbows are three things that come to mind when I think of Ashker's, and the last one because of all the colors. So beautiful.When will you find a better cafe to come to? They have a piano for you to play, the healthiest of things for you to eat, and you always leave with a smile."}, {"review_id": "NqswIDzVP26SLmYbt--fjw", "user_id": "k11yYyREUD2NtOaYXHu-cw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Finally got to try this place after living only a few miles away for the past year. So glad I finally did. I ordered the chicken & pesto panini and grabbed the lime juice sitting on the ice bar by the counter. We grabbed our order to go and it came out in about 10 minutes even though it was extremely busy and every table was taken. The food was excellent but I especially loved the juice. I will absolutely be back to try all of the other juices because I am impressed by how delicious and healthy mine was. We also really liked the different types of fruit water offered for free to drink. I can't wait to come by here to sit and read after work soon."}, {"review_id": "_Vquvpa4s0ne4tcrF1exzQ", "user_id": "yh8_9Ix1wp9dekvyOZbilQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "I really like how this spot is so generous with their common meeting rooms. You can book out a conference room free of charge, and it was perfect for my coworker and I to take some calls and get some work done while I was in town visiting. It's rare to find a place that just provides that free of charge! It's nothing fancy in terms of decor, but it feels comfortable and lived-in.Of course, we didn't just use their space - we also bought plenty of food and drink from them, which was also great. I loved their Jamaican blend coffee, their fresh beet juice, and especially their coconut chocolate chip scone. I also had their Italian bowl, which came with lots of veggies and quinoa and was a super healthy and filling lunch choice.The service was sweet and they were on top of everything even though half of their space was closed down when we were there for floor repairs. I respect that they seem to respect their community and want to contribute a space for people to get their work done, whatever that work may be!"}, {"review_id": "Hp0ExulhVNTT2bQXdPs63Q", "user_id": "l9In_PKUGrW8ExHkr9MbPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Okay. About time I praised Ashker's for how awesome it is.Where do I start? The food and drinks are always excellent. Their juices are to die for. I've come here to work quite a few times, and every trip has been nothing short of excellent.I admire how easy-going this place is. They really make it a breeze to be able to sit down and set up for whatever work (or play!) you may want to do here, and they're always pretty quick to take your order and get your food out to you. I've been here for breakfast and for lunch, and the food I've ordered here has always been so well made, and incredibly delicious. I recently had their Chicken Pesto Panino, and o-m-g, new favorite sandwich! It was incredibly flavorful. Best hot sammy with chicken that I've ever had. I'm also a really big fan of their omelettes, too.I don't drink their juices often enough, which is honestly a crime. That stuff is so good that you'll forget it's actually a pretty healthy beverage option too.Easy parking is such a big bonus. I usually park on the parkway close to where it crosses Elmwood and just walk over to Ashker's from there (free parking, aww yeah!).Definitely come here for a delicious, healthy bite amidst the workweek drag."}, {"review_id": "oEyxZkQAtFuF2Dcfl8Wvbw", "user_id": "ic-tyi1jElL_umxZVh8KNA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "Great variety of fruit juices.Staff helpful and friendly.Sign mentioned MOVING...

The prices are very affordable and you get awesome food here! Everything is so delicious! I love their breakfast sandwiches and the smoothies are to die for! You can get fresh press juices served in a mason jar and some awesome light snack/appetizer dishes too! Lots of veggie based options too for a light and fresh lunch! Great brunch spot. They also serve my favourite coffee \"Jamaica me crazy\"!

I was here on a weekday and while there was a steady flow of customers, it wasn't crowded or busy.  You order at the front, take a seat, and an employee will bring you your food. My friend and I split the Chicken and Sauteed Mushroom Panini, Cinnamon French Toast topped with Peaches (their special at the time) and maple syrup, and a Golden Child juice. We also got their Green Machine juice to-go. They have a mason jar return program - $1 off your next order when you bring back your jar. There is also some infused water (cucumber, grapefruit, etc.) you can help yourself to. For delicious, healthy, and reasonably priced food, you can't go wrong. I retuned a second time with a group of friends after recommending it to them. I got the breakfast scramble + jam on the side with Kale Cocktail juice. Breakfast wise, it's hard to stand out - it was your typical scrambled eggs + veggies + home fries + toast but very good and filling (which is what I expected) nonetheless. I really like the vibe of the cafe. There are large tables (also some seating area outside), a perfect area to get some light work or studying done if you don't mind the background music, and of course, delicious food and drinks. I am excited to try out their other juices and smoothies."}, {"review_id": "Ul35zaJyDHjA1IbUR47MpA", "user_id": "5eQVN1PF4d2PWtSJenwfCw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Today I stopped in for a healthy breakfast(trying to my life right in the New year). I had the breakfast oats with sunflower seeds, blueberries and quinoa. I love oatmeal meal but I was a little nervous about the sunflower seeds; I was pleasantly surprised they didn't really bother me or interfere with the taste. It was very filling and held me over well past lunch. As soon as the sweet tooth monster started to creep in I remembered I had a vegan coconut chocolate chip scone. It was love at first bite, I didn't miss any of animals products I typically eat in baked goods. I only had room for a few bites because I was still full from the oats. I'm sure it will be just as good for dessert tonight."}, {"review_id": "mAjd8vuwfDf3xhP8k9bXIw", "user_id": "XTWxyaZdYpP9kvuzwXSxdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/17/2017", "text": "Swoon, Ashker's. Now this is seriously my type of business. Ashker's is one of those places where I'm able to look past the small flaws and see the business for a whole: one that gives back to the community and takes pride in what they do.Before I moved to Buffalo, I had heard of Ashker's and knew I had to seek them out when I could. That was over a year ago, and now I still try to stop in when I can. Ashker's is reasonably convenient, it's far enough up Elmwood that even though you face the dreaded street parking, it might not be as bad as you thought. As someone who dreads street parking, this is huge. I've only had issues finding a spot once, and that was on a sunny Saturday afternoon, when everyone is out and about. In hindsight, I really should have anticipated that one.The atmosphere is inviting and makes you think of the kind of place everyone goes to after the gym, which is probably true for a large portion of the clientele. It's very laid back and helps you to slow down on a crazy busy day. Admittedly, the service can be slow, especially during the more busy times. You will likely have to wait a bit, especially if you are ordering food as opposed to a smoothie or juice, drinks tend to be served significantly faster. It's not a physically large kitchen, and you can see through to the back, where the staff is hard at work. If you order food, consider bringing a book, or stop off at Talking Leaves to find something before you go to Ashker's and support another business in the neighborhood. I've done this before and it definitely helps to have something to read if you're the impatient type.Now, as far as the food and smoothies go, I'm a fan. This is one of those times where I get something, devour it, and then think to myself, \"I could MAKE THIS!\" and of course, know deep down that it wouldn't be quite the same. Prices are reasonable, with breakfast sandwiches running in the $5 range, panini and wraps in the $10-ish range. In particular, I strongly recommend the veggie, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich, especially if you haven't been to Ashker's before. Smoothies and juices run in the $4-5 range and are decent sized portions.It's probably a good thing that I don't live close to Ashker's or I'd be there all the time, but that's not a bad thing to want to support a business you like. I'd love to see their menu grow, I agree with the Yelpers who'd like to see more acai on the menu, it's a natural fit. I imagine that Ashker's will expand as needed in the future, and I'll certainly be in line for my smoothie when they do, and even before that anyway."}, {"review_id": "3XZyQX4VHEMUjZxIi820HA", "user_id": "rf6L1B4EIkZPZkDhA8XnqA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/11/2017", "text": "I ordered a breakfast sandwich to go. The cafe does have dine in service for its patrons however I expected my breakfast sandwich to be ready within ten minutes. I finally asked the cashier after twenty minutes and she told me that they're extremely backed up. I realized that it was a Saturday morning/prime time for brunch but I wish the cashier forewarned me that there are a ton of orders beforehand so I could've gauged the time. Some patrons sitting looked like they were just there for juice/coffee so I did not know whether they were waiting for food. (Just a tip for others looking to order any food item to go)There are juices displayed right by the cashier/counter area have adorable signs displaying all its ingredients for each beverage. Typically juices do not come chilled but the fact that they're sitting on an ice bank, made the juices cold and that was a nice touch!I grabbed the \"Golden Child\" and \"Green Squeeze\" which were extremely delicious."}, {"review_id": "3lXJ_mST1_9zC-bVM2uOSw", "user_id": "NEtsatXYHQ43OeRzB_MOWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/30/2017", "text": "One of my favorite spots in Buffalo and Elmwood. This is the perfect place for brunch, lunch, a snack, to grab a beverage. When you first walk in you are greeted with a hipster ambiance where their furniture seemed to have been hauled from you local thrift store and recycled into furniture for this place. I like how unique the decor is. In addition to that, they have different types of fruit waters on the the side for you to sip at your convenience. Things Ordered:French Toast: I was craving french toast that day and just ordered itPeach Passion: One of my favorite smoothies there, perfect for a summer day and for morningVanilla Almond Latte: I usually don't like almond but this latte was yummy. I would get this next time when I am in the mood the coffee. Delish Breakfast Panino: Made with bacon, egg, cheese & tomato on multi-grain bread and then they use a panini press to press it for extra crunchiness. Solid breakfast panini. Sunrise Quesadilla: Made with scrambled egg, spinach, tomato, onion, banana peppers, roasted red peppers cheddar. Perfect option for those who are vegetarian. Highly recommend this place, its right on Elmwood where there's cute stores to walk into after your meal here. The only thing is the lines can get long and my friend and I did wait a while for our food when we dined in, however, you don't need to pay for tips!"}, {"review_id": "6BXerYTRNMZSgeEkRD1r5g", "user_id": "GewPQ7ucd3XQ0TRhWSyaSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "I came here for the fresh juice and it was amazing!

I ordered a coffee and a breakfast wrap. This place is very reasonably priced. It's a busy place so don't plan to sit and get work done there. There were 4 coffees foto choose from. I chose the Ethiopian blend and it was so good. They are famous for their smoothies and I loved how they had chilled pre-made ones and freshly squeezed juices too if you wanted. The wrap was nicely made with fluffy scrambled eggs and a crispy bacon slice along with spinach in a spinach tortilla. Yummy! Their service is incredible.

It was packed when I went on a warm Saturday in June. It took a while to order. It also took a pretty long time to get my food, but I didn't mind all that much because the atmosphere is  great. The artwork is amazing. The staff is friendly. I believe it was the owner who kept popping up some of every where taking orders, refilling the infused waters,  bringing out smoothies and food, checking in on customers. It's a real feel of community and he  (and the staff) make you feel at home. I had the sirloin steak salad and the steak fajita wrap. The salad was amazing. The cheese melted in the salad just right without making the leaves hot and soggy. The steak was tender. I loved the dressing. Everything was fresh and was absolutely delicious. Steak fajita was good as well. I also had a cherry berry banana smoothie and tropical twist smoothie. Both were refreshing and delicious, though I favored the tropical twist more. I always try to the smoothies but I'll have to try some if their pressed juice one day. There are a few I eye every time and never get around to trying them.I love this place."}, {"review_id": "c5l3ZmP3HPCbkxBG5_YU7w", "user_id": "VMR6MFg0ImJMQMvrTAV0ug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "This an update of a previous 3 star review:I ended up coming back here on a Sunday around 4pm when I thought it wouldn't be busy; my boyfriend and grandma were craving smoothies. The interior is always charmingly quaint and rustic. I love that they display local artists works on the walls and have a diverse employ. The place was busy when we got here...I was about to roll my eyes and say \"not again\", but the cashier, cook, and food runner made me stay.  They all had smiles on their faces and stayed cool during a busy rush.We got about $50 worth of food, juices, and smoothies (well worth the price).  The food was good; my boyfriend couldn't stop raving about his chicken Caesar wrap or his tropical passion smoothie.  He wants to come here everyday, now! I enjoyed my steak fajita wrap, but I felt like it was missing something. It still tasted great though. I guess my last visit before this review was a fluke; I bet I caught them on a bad day during a super busy rush...I manage a restaurant...I know how it is.   Either way, I will be back!
