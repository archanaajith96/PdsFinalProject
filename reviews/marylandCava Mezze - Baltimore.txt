It's all tapas so expect to share and sample the menu. My friends and I ordered all of the veggie options and it's a great option for vegetarians. It's super trendy and has cool art along the walls. The dark interior makes it moody and a good spot late at night. The drinks are great too - they make their ginger beer for the Moscow mule and there's another good cucumber drink that's refreshing.If you go for brunch you absolutely have to do their deal of all you can eat and drink (sort of - you pay $0.25/mimosa). I've never had anything except great service here. Definitely make a reservation though."}, {"review_id": "cw-yZh86_8K1QEEIA6yaxw", "user_id": "4kmfWahEwb_iIDD95z4ilg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Meh. I just didn't see the luster and excitement about this place. We came during the evening, on a week night, and it was dead. Not that that mattered, because I was just hungry. The atmosphere was cool and trendy, so I can see why the younger crowd would enjoy it. It's the food that just really didn't impress me, and for the price point, it's just not worth it. Very so-so. Everything is served tapas style, and while there were some interesting flavors, nothing blew me away. And almost everything we had was fried somehow. Maybe that was the luck of the draw on our part in ordering.Follow me on my way to Foodietown! britneygfoodie.yelp.com"}, {"review_id": "orp7jZGEqRiUsVp4xW15kA", "user_id": "xwbSZ7yF3jcwvwNCWZMZEg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Went here last night on a double date with another couple. It was good! Of course, we had to start with the saganaki after seeing other tables order the flaming cheese. You really felt the heat off the flames when the waitress did it! Definitely a fun experience. Plus, it tasted great! What can be bad about flambéed feta with lemon?Then we got a bunch of plates to share:-Opa Opa Shrimp:  This was the one that I was most excited about, but it wasn't that great. The shrimp were tough and the dish overall did not have much flavor. Sad face.-Roasted Cauliflower: Loved it!-Brussels Sprouts: This was my favorite dish of the night, believe it or not. I wasn't sure how the greek yogurt would pair with them, but what a great idea! Outstanding.-Fried Chicken Sliders: These were really good! The bun was soft and doughy, and the toppings were crunchy and perfect.-Chicken Souvlaki: No bueno. These were very dry and tough to chew through.-Lamb meatballs: Very rich, but very good. These had a ton of flavor, but again I thought the meat was a little dry.I also want to note that the staff were extremely accommodating to someone in our party with a shellfish allergy. Apparently most things on the menu are either fried in the same oil as shellfish or put on the grill where shellfish go, so our friend could not eat anything that we ordered. Not even the roasted veggies! We were very surprised by this. He got a seperate salad and then the kitchen made him the short ribs with special pan fried potatoes that were sauteed in their own pan and not in the fryer oil."}, {"review_id": "58jXJgn6WFOM0xxwGQr0KQ", "user_id": "V0c-AS2FFCeSaV-3JfG5vA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Before leaving the city on my last trip to Baltimore, the husband and I had dinner at Cava Mezze on Fleet Street. I'll tell you right away; it's wonderful for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. I must make sure that my guy has options whenever we eat out. This place was perfect! Many delicious options, and the wait staff were cool about us asking if any items were cooked with animal products (like broth or lard). They were very accommodating here. Here are the items that we (or I) ate and would recommend:VEGETARIAN ITEMS: -- Tzatziki dip (Greek yogurt, cucumber, garlic)-- Crazy Feta dip (whipped feta, jalapeno)-- Village salad (tomatoes, English cucumbers, aged feta, bell peppers, kalamato olives, red onion, oregano, vinaigrette)-- Mushrooms (roasted, turmeric butter, metaxa brandy, oregano, garlic, kefalograviera)-- Roasted Cauliflower (crispy chickpeas, goat cheese, spicy dill vinaigrette)-- Spanakopita (hand rolled in house, spinach, feta, leek, phyllo)-- Falafel (crispy chickpeas, cilantro, olive hummus, honey oregano vinaigrette, spinach, arugula)NON-VEGETARIAN ITEMS:-- Shrimp (grilled, split pea puree, dill, lemon)-- Crispy Pork Belly (sour cherry glaze, cauliflower turmeric puree, hazelnut spice)-- Lollipop Chicken (honey, Greek yogurt, walnuts)Also, the interior of the restaurant is very modern and chic. It would be a great place for a date or a meal with friends.

I was in Baltimore for a friends birthday and brunch is always a given on a birthday weekend and he did the research and suggested Cava Mezze. Here's the deal: all you can eat for $35 and then mimosas are 25cents each!  Sounded like a great deal to me! We were seated right away, but we did have a reservation. Our waiter explained how things worked...the $35 all you can eat menu consists of tapas you're free to order throughout your brunch however you want. I think there was a rule about how many simultaneous plates a person could order at once? Or maybe just a suggestion? The limit didn't have any effect on our experience. The mimosas and food were flowing. I tried:*breakfast salmon: this is a must order! pita with feta cream cheese and smoked salmon, we went through three or four plates of this *greek yogurt: I'm never one to order yogurt but I felt like should try as many things as I could and this was some of the best fruit and yogurt I've ever had..the fruit was fresh and the yogurt rich and delicious *skillet cake: these were small pancakes that had an extra delicious fried taste to them, the chocolate adds a nice touch and this is a good option for those who like sweet breakfasts *village fritatta: more like an omelet than a frittata in my opinion but no complaints on that. It was stuffed with spinach, feta and leeks...so good, the table got at least two of these *chickpea hash: these were pretty good, not amazing, but I also may have been getting full. The rest of the table had some things my non meat eating self couldn't indulge in like chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits, steak and eggs...everyone was so happy with this brunch. We definitely hit the mimosas a little hard too but at $0.25 each it only added a dollar or two to the bill. The service was great, some items were slower to come out of the kitchen than other but it's not like we ever sat there with nothing in front of us, and the waiter did keep us posted when things were taking a little longer. Who knew a Greek place would have such a great brunch! This will be a must stop for me the next time I do Baltimore."}, {"review_id": "P0TxtGz_CD71iG8TFaa0BQ", "user_id": "p5sRfw_mDHha3JXf7akIOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Pita pita pita pita rockin errwhere rockin errwhere.YOU MUST GET THE SAGANAKI. If you don't like cheese- go home. Great place for people who love variety and sharing and good for moderate sized groups- obvi it's a tapas place. 2 dishes per person is sufficient. Plus you get pita bread with a spicy tomato spread and olive oil to start off regardless of what you order. I wouldn't say Cava Mezze is expensive, but it's also not cheap eats either. It's in between, but you do get what you pay for in terms of quality and nice presentation AND all DA PITA YOU WANT. Service: great! No complaints. However, we did come at a very off time so it was very dead. There are a LOT of tables and I imagine during peak days/times it gets super busy.Saganaki- it's AMAZING and it's a show- just order it and you'll seeBlack eyed peas- surprisingly one of my favorites!

The zucchini fritters have a sauce made out of mint, dill, and tzatziki that paired together nicely! Then we ordered the pork belly and the scallops risotto. The pork belly was my favorite!

This one is more brightly lit and casual atmosphere. The servers are all attentive, down to earth, and fun. My favorite mezzes on the menu are the saganaki (they bring this cheese to your table and set it on fire in front of you!), spanakopita, scallops risotto, lamb chops, and gyros.

Enough said.Located on Fleet Street in downtown Baltimore, Cava Mezze offers a super-casual restaurant environment for patrons looking to enjoy phenomenal Mediterranean dishes. The portions at Cava are small, which means they're perfect for sharing (tapas-style), or for pairing (i.e. one meat, one vegetable, etc.). Either way, you really can't go wrong. From the salads to the vegetables to the meats and seafood -- everything is extremely popular at Cava Mezze, and for good reason.During my recent visit to CM, our kind waiter briefly explained the tapas-style menu to us, and provided us with a few recommendations and personal suggestions. While we glanced over the menu -- and peeked at the food on tables around us (I mean, everything just looked and smelled SO good!) -- our waiter brought some (complementary) delicious, warm pita bread and accompanying dips for us to snack on. WOW, it was love at first bite already...and we hadn't even ordered! Ultimately, a short time later, my boyfriend and I decided to each order a salad, a meat/seafood option, and to share a vegetable. To specify, I ordered the Village Salad and the Chicken Slouvaki, he ordered the Beet Salad and the Scallops (at our waiter's recommendation), and we shared an order of the Roasted Cauliflower, as well. It was the perfect amount of food -- we were full, but not too full, and everything was was utterly delightful. The salads were decadent, and filled with quality product identity; the chicken and scallops were cooked perfectly; and the cauliflower was simply amazing! Our primary conversation during the meal simply revolved around how delicious everything was! :)If I had to change one thing about Cava, it would be the venue, itself. That is, it's covered with hard surfaces (the tables, the walls, the floor, etc.) -- meaning it can get extremely loud. A good setting for groups or friendly get togethers; not necessarily the makings of a romantic date. Still--it made for a great Saturday night experience with my boyfriend, and I most certainly hope to return!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cava-mezze-baltimore-baltimore-2?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
