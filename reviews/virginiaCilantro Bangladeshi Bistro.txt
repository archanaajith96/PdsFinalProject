Lunch is your best bet because they have a large variety to choose from already prepared. If your having trouble with a selection definitely ask whomever is working what their suggestion is.One of my favorite things about this restaurant is how clean it is, you can tell they take pride in keeping things tidy and I'm sure that reflects in the back of the house just as much as the front of the house."}, {"review_id": "_8_vlrK1-xwstqujRXPnKg", "user_id": "V7nH5O-2fdF27tZWkIBJeg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I've been hearing so much about Cilantro and I've lived close by for about 4 years and finally went in late on a Saturday to try it. The food was delicious!!!My husband ordered the Jhaal Beef. So delicious and tender, but it was spicy. A little too spicy for my husband but perfect for me. It will make you sweat a little lol. I ordered the shrimp malaikari and it was very good. Not spicy but flavorful. Definitely could taste the coconut milk, and it was kinda sweet. We also got Alu Chop which was very good as well. It's like a fried potato cake stuffed with a meaty filling. The entree came with a very small salad of cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onion, and a large cup of water. There was a case with different canned/bottled drinks you could purchase. I'm not sure if they had fountain drinks or not. The food is amazing. However the inside is small. There is maybe room for 20-30 people to eat inside. So if you have a large group, you might have to call ahead to let them know; I'm not sure if they can accommodate you but I've driven by and seen groups inside. The restroom was clean."}, {"review_id": "wLJtYs_Jx-nqGbGrraj3HQ", "user_id": "IAqCB48k6QkSfWn8ZttmSw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "first time taking out on a vegan spot this 2018, they had other menu with meat as well, I had 4 veggie dish, I had spinachw/lima beans, okra w/potatoes, cauliflower, eggplant w/ tamarind and a soup for $13.50(including my tip for to go)its for lunch, kinda pricey for me, usually if its only vegetables, its a littlecheaper than the regular price, the veggies was good but there is an after taste i dont know maybe the oil that they used or maybe the spice, they are similar to indian but indian was more flavorfull. I love to cook on different kinds of ethnic cuisine, if ever i will cook it for myself my $13.50  would have been a better quality fresh vegetables that I can buy. Dont get me wrong, this is only for my opinion. They are family own resto, so give it a try and tell me what you think."}, {"review_id": "zWkiNUptVaC6ZUUKkk4U6g", "user_id": "u8ybdg4OLkRXgkzR42PkSg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/5/2017", "text": "Sooooo.... my coworkers and I was near and decided to come here for lunch and I'm glad because it was on my bookmark list. The parking space is small as it shares the lot with the convenient store next door but it was pretty spacious inside. The staff was very helpful in answering all our questions since we were all clueless on what we wanted! It's cafeteria style, in which the food is already prepared and you just pick what you want.  I tried a little of everything from my coworker's and I must say it was all good! It's curry flavor, some spicy, and some meat dishes use cream. It wasn't over overwhelming, so if you are used to this kind of spices and flavor you will enjoy the restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "Z3IacTjBviHtmkDNNJlOyQ", "user_id": "4pAKe2UGh3A3-gtSJC1-nw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/2/2017", "text": "My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this amazing hole in the wall restaurant on the way to the Botanical Gardens. We have never tried Bangladeshi food previously, so we were open to trying something new. The place is small, but there is a good amount of seating. The staff was very welcoming when we entered. We weren't familiar with the food, but the nice gentleman at the counter explained the menu thoroughly to us. The menu is small, but contains good choices (even a vegetarian option). I ended up deciding on the shrimp malaikari and my boyfriend ordered the shahi chicken. We also ordered roti and alu chop. I knew we were about to have a great meal based on the aroma of the food. Every single thing we ordered was delectable!! I can't wait to go back to try more of their dishes!!"}, {"review_id": "kyeSAjj2F1bKngx-p6Y7NA", "user_id": "DvufwoK7dborG73iLJVxDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/16/2017", "text": "Ok ...DElightful,Delectable,DELICIOUS. You can smell how great your foods going to be before you walk in. The owner and staff are courteous and welcoming. The restaurant is small but the flavor of the food is huge. I actually contemplated moving to Bangladesh after my first bite! Try the curry goat and coconut shrimp.... it's excellent. The perfect combo of curry and spice. I also had the veggie medley which included potatoes and squash, very savory. I really like the layout of the food. You are able to split your order so that you can try two dishes at once. Apparently this place is all the rage. I had the pleasure of meeting Norfolk's own Mayor Kenny Alexander and he definitely enjoyed his meal.

The owner is so friendly and will remember you, even on your second visit.The shrimp is amazing... consider yourself warned though, if you get that with the pulao rice, you will be bathing in butter. It's delicious, but we felt a bit greasy afterwards. On my second visit I got half shrimp and half shahi chicken and that felt much more balanced-- I also went for a long walk afterwards.Fresh squeezed limeade is wonderful, as is the rice pudding (I forget the exact name).Some of the earlier pictures show much lower prices than they currently have.

I've never tried Bangledesh food before but it was the perfect blend of spices and slow-cooked meat that literally melts in your mouth.

My girlfriend is Bengali and her mom makes great authentic food. Cilantro's food was pretty comparable. I got the goat curry which was full of flavor. The goat was tender and cooked to perfection. I also got the dahl which was also full of flavor. The place was in a pretty out of the way location, but definitely a find in Norfolk. I didn't expect to find good ethnic food in the area. Another note is there was definitely a fusion aspect between Indian and Bangladeshi. There was a noticeably spicier take on the cuisine than is normally in Bengali cooking. Pricing was respectable. Average pricing was in the low teens. $10-15 I would estimate.Good value for great food. Definitely a must go."}, {"review_id": "xjVLK82Yl8pwUJyTSnglyA", "user_id": "pMW8yW41XuXFuJb0ngNzZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "The food here is to die for!!!
