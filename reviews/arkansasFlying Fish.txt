I was shocked that there was a line out the door at 4PM! I thought I was going to beat the crowd then. Nope. But it moved, and the food was good enough that we were not upset to wait. You order up at the counter (grab a menu and decide what you want) and wait till your buzzer goes off, then go up to grab your meal and head back to your table. Plenty of seating, even with the crowd.Grab complimentary tarter sauce, cocktail sauce, ketchup, onions, and lemons.The atmosphere in the place is so fun with all of the bass on the wall - both singing and taxidermied catches, it was a big part of the reason I wanted to come. Come for the weird decor, stay for the food. +Whole fried snapper vera cruz - a tasty and unique meal, nice presentation, took a while to prepare.+Fried catfish and shrimp combo - had to get catfish while down south, the breading on this fried basket was incredible - made it 'snappy' for an extra flare. +Got a side of vera cruz sauce and it was great to dip pour over the snapper, dip the catfish in, and generally eat as a soup as well.All seafood was cooked perfectly and we left very happy.Pro tip:+Parking in DT Little Rock is free after 6PM and on weekends."}, {"review_id": "saqa_uNXxT8WtI8TOXTndw", "user_id": "nTMztAQ3Dq63Xb3taedhyQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I would go out of my way to eat at Flying Fish again. My family and I were traveling in Little Rock AR and had heard that catfish was a specialty in the area. We went to the popular local restaurant called Flying Fish. We arrived about 6 p.m. Already people were lining up out the door. The wait was not that long to get to the counter to order. We got the 2 piece catfish basket which came with two hush puppies and French fries. We substituted grilled zucchini and squash for the fries. We got a buzzer to tell when food was ready.  We got generously sized catfish filets that were breaded in cornmeal- so good!  The hush puppies were very good but a little smaller than some that I have had in the south. The grilled zucchini and squash was perfectly cooked so it had a slight crispness. My only disappointment was that the veggies had cooled off by the time we got them.  That is why I gave four stars rather than five. We ordered a side dish of fried Okra. I had never tried it. It was good, but I tasted mostly the breading. We topped off our meal with peach empanadas (fried pies). They were crispy and had good size chunks of peaches. The decor was fun too.  Walls were filled with pictures of people fishing and \"Billy Bass\" plaques. Customers signed and decorated the pictures and plaques. I found it fun that locals in line were willing to help us newbies figure out the menu. I thoroughly enjoyed this unique place."}, {"review_id": "cElNH4wSMjzY_iKm1pWYow", "user_id": "XIDHp_Bs__wKRbPyXcghLQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "Lots of seafood options from fried catfish to grilled trout to crab legs.Best hush puppies....hands down.

The restaurant is adorned with photos of people's catches and taxideremed fish (still can't tell if they're real or not). The front of the restaurant has a nice garage like window to have a nice view of the street and there's the perfect amount of seating that when you place your order there is open seating.We got the 2 piece grilled fish, crayfish chowder, and gumbo.There was more than enough food for 3 adults and a toddler.For the grilled fish we got the salmon and trout butter style. Not too greasy, but a tad bit on the dry side for the trout. Excellently deboned and nice grilled vegetables with a lemon sauce.The gumbo was not quite what we thought it would be, but still nice. The chowder was a hearty thick and spicy bowl of soup and I would definitely get it again. Overall 4 stars since it's good but not great and nice family atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "tZ77tvP9s0pp_eTfnAmhOQ", "user_id": "LLK0G9Q5IaOmHy35nq8B8Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Bit of a long line, but it moved relatively smoothly.  There is a large menu to choose from and 3 flavors. I selected \"snappy\" which in my case was not flavor related as much as it was well cooked, over cooked to my taste. Missing expected seasoning flavor. I had the shrimp, catfish, oyster platter and it was ok. I added habernero and pepper and tartar sauce to get some flavor. There isn't any \"OLD Bays\" any where to be seen. That should be added to the table, like yesterday. Large beer selection chilled. The crab-legs were ok. You should skip the calamari. Overall this is a ok place if you are out exploring. Not somewhere to go out of your way for. I would recommend a effort in some seasoning, or maybe it was a off day."}, {"review_id": "g9bwE15a17dciwAqB4xRQA", "user_id": "SJ0k6NQzsRCXJe1Fs7WijQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "I don't know if I've ever been as nervous standing in line to order food as I was at Flying Fish. Everything looked incredible, and since I'm rarely in Little Rock I didn't want to make a mistake. I went with the grilled grouper and a cup of gumbo and needless to say, my fears were alleviated. Everything was incredible, yet somehow the least thought about things -- grilled zucchini and squash -- might have been my favorite. I love everything about this place. If I ever open a restaurant I will get sued because it will be exactly like Flying Fish."}, {"review_id": "j4TaJkkR-MZoKDyc3D9-Tg", "user_id": "32hMcxaohQrPBbNi5HRIeg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I came to Flying Fish many years ago, 2007 I believe.

There was a line that started outside but moved smartly and when our turn came we ordered shrimp and chicken and shrimp and catfish combos. We got our flashing buzzer and found a table and waited while taking in the unique decorations, which consisted of the largest collection of singing mounted fish we have ever seen. We got our food and began to enjoy one of the best meals of our time in Little Rock. Be ready, the large shrimp are butterflied and the Flying Fish cocktail sauce is fantastic requiring you to double or triple dip the shrimp to maximize your consumption of the shrimp and cocktail sauce. The catfish - tartar sauce is second to none and the chicken strips were top shelf. We had the fried jalapeños which we great because they had all the flavor without the massive burn. Highly recommend this seafood place."}, {"review_id": "OufCogXptyTGE_GgJ1UKkg", "user_id": "kPgNVSxXnhkyWBkqTcW45g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2017", "text": "WHOA! Being the southern-fried seafood snobs that they are, my parents would absolutely LOVE this place! After an unfortunate (early closing) incident at Gus' down the block (boo hiss), we decided on Flying Fish as a dinner alternative. But \"don't cry for me Argentina\"... It was obviously meant to be as I've had this place bookmarked for a while now, and we LOVED it! EVERYTHING was DELISH! (How can that be? Like, everything.) I couldn't stop eating. We had po'boys, calamari, catfish, chicken tenders, and jumbo shrimp! I like that their seafood is seasoned very well, and not fried too hard. The batter is the perfect consistency for the light crunch that I like on my fried seafood! I didn't get the chance to photograph mine or the hubby's plate if that tells you anything. We went in for the kill immediately. (That never happens)[Sidebar: I have to randomly shout out their sweet tea which was perfect! Great flavor, and not too sweet--just right!] Last point: Usually at seafood joints, I never eat my hush puppies because I save them for last and that point in the meal I'm either too full or just not interested. Well, tonight I was BOTH (full and- I tried to be- uninterested) but I had to taste one because everything was so good that I was kinda' looking for the \"catch.\" (Don't judge) Yep, and in pure pettiness it all came down to a friggin' hush puppy! (lol) Well, I bit half, fell in love, and ate both. See... literally Ever-Y-Thing was great! Who does that?! Long story, short... I loved my dinner at Flying Fish, and I'll be back-- hopefully with my parentals in tow. They've got to get a load of this!"}, {"review_id": "b_hp_Kvc8EShHG7zxiE32Q", "user_id": "uyAxpy0SIZ8SJTO8LUFzng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Well I came to see the Billy Bass Adoption Center and stayed for the food!!
