Cozy with a warm ambience and buzz, which is especially pleasant in the winter.  It is hard to find a seat sometimes, since the space is small and narrow.  Good mixed crowd.You can also order food from the uncle nicks nearby."}, {"review_id": "VhNtvJnJ3vtDI3Ce9yUZlg", "user_id": "_tHSAp8CgI14if0rnD2aHw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2016", "text": "It's a very small space and features fairly basic tables and chairs...but there is a fire place and a huge selection of beers on tap.  The staff knows about beer too so they can provide guidance to help you find beers you might like and don't know about.If you like a variety of good beers and want a simple place to enjoy some drinks with friends this is a go to joint in downtown.  Not quite a pub feel but gives you some of the same at a much lower price point, that's a win in my mind."}, {"review_id": "sqhBd2w7J4SuxRlXei3XqQ", "user_id": "YQ7jD5Wl-Y6mtdUvfCfOIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/6/2017", "text": "Awesome micro pub bar!  This place had a wonderful selection of craft beers from all over.  They had small batch beers, seasonal beers and even some local Rockford stuff.  We will be stopping back here again soon.  Smaller pub with a comfortable cozy feel!"}, {"review_id": "sIIYWM61klA2xclA8NaRAA", "user_id": "RkgwgvTEu9BkHjEcOOP7MA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2017", "text": "Amazing craft cocktails and craft beer.

Take advantage of their interesting selection of ridiculous beers at great prices while you can for who knows when Uncle Nick's patronage will cease, this place will vanish and next thing you know you're paying ten large for a beer cause there is a gargoyle on the bottle or clown shoes or some other nonsense.

It's a good bar with a wide selection and great prices. On draft they have a lot of the local and/or popular craft beers. Their selection rotates, but usually only to other local/popular craft beers. You hardly ever see one that isn't a staple in any of the local liqour stores. (Bell's, Founders, Dark horse, Avery, Flying Dog, Rogue, Two Brothers,  etc) They also have some imports. Service is hit and miss. Sometimes I'm served quickly, other's it's a slow long wait. This place is a night ender. With the average beer having a higher ABV than what most people are used to, you don't hit this place early unless you want to get thrashed.

My fiancee and I both have family in Rockford and visit pretty regularly. I gave my cousin a ring to see what he was up to and we met up at the Oasis. I was completely in shock at the selection of beers and moreover the price that they were being offered up for. The staff was knowledgeable, friendly and capable of making suggestions based on the drinkers preferences. The ambiance has a warm and welcoming lounge feel too it, which on the right night could border on romantic. That being said, if a date is what you're going for I wouldn't recommend making your stop at Oasis late at night or on a weekend, the decibels jump up quite a bit.I don't think I'm being insulting to any native Rockfordians here, but places like Oasis that offer a degree of refinement and culture are as welcome as they are rare. It's great to see the potential of a frequently written off city carry it's pulse through establishments like this. If you're in Rockford, stop here for a drink, it'll be worth it."}, {"review_id": "tdFViKqZ2eP0zcP8wqbWxA", "user_id": "6ImKvwZzCTfD2kI6Pt4g5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/14/2012", "text": "Awesome beer. Arriving outside at night, we were unsure whether or not we should go in. Yeah, it is a little shady. Once you get inside, though, it's rather nice. A very small bar, there are maybe 7 tables and ~8 seats at the bar. The food is delivered from across the street (a fast food place, Uncle Nick's I think). We liked the food. Not expecting anything fancy, we were very impressed with the place. This is a great place for some awesome beer, which is exactly what we wanted. No TV's, so no watching the game, just some amazing drinks and quiet talking atmosphere. We loved it; 5/5. Expectations were exceeded. Glad we found this bar. Oh, the bartender was very cool, too. The beer is cheap, too, for what you get. $4 for specialty draft imports is incredible."}, {"review_id": "_FFuhw3sHMFPSTwWIEFJqw", "user_id": "omEGMij0h_rja-BFbofHBg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/27/2013", "text": "Very good bar.
