Although it doesn't taste very authentic, the food tastes good and is reasonably priced. The owner and staff are friendly, your order at the counter and they call your name when it's ready while making sure everything is how you want it. The interior needs a face lift, it looks a little dated and the seating needs new upholstery. Overall the best tasting Middle Eastern themed restaurant in the area.Pro's+Fresh+StaffCon's-Interior"}, {"review_id": "oY9y5ijSsXOjry514tL08Q", "user_id": "Oczs8WWm45yVWdn6M32h6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Friendly atmosphere, fresh food, and full of loyal customers. Walking into Manna Mediterranean Grill, it doesn't appear to be anything special, but everything after that is a great experience. The staff was super friendly and engaged me in conversation. All around you could see loyal customers that knew their way around. Finally, the food was great. I had a falafel sampler that cane with tabouleh salad. It all had great flavor and made me decide that I need to come back and try some more of their food!"}, {"review_id": "O5hMQ61ez6usBZKCDQpCCg", "user_id": "EWvKGHWJw9EwnSSOvddqHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "The food here is incredible. I lived in Evansville for five years and moved to Florida for four years. Upon my return, I immediately had a craving for Manna. The food has remained consistently delicious as well as the friendly owners and staff. A must for people who are visiting or want to try something new. I always get the chicken shwarma. They even have a drive through."}, {"review_id": "cskw-hQMGz4A3CJRTXoFxA", "user_id": "s4BMPW8VV-ELjDwV6zjWCQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "If you want Mediterranean food you will be satisfied with Manna.

Go here at least once a month. Normally get the vegetarian platter, comes with hummus, baba ganoush, pitas, grape leaves, falafel, and your choice of salad. Gyro is also good.

The owner is Syrian and brings the flavors of his home to the area. The hummus is made fresh daily and I haven't had stuffed grape leaves this good anywhere in the United States by far. The mixed grill is wonderful, as are the shawarmas, but the lamb kebabs are my favorite!"}, {"review_id": "YPK5MsdFroSl53yLamwj_w", "user_id": "_ltg7d0OKtOH0hk5qXkefw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/27/2017", "text": "The food is average.
