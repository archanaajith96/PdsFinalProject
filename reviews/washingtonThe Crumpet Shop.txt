We arrive as they're closing, and running out of crumpets, so we're offered \"employee crumpets\", the less beautiful crumpets that they don't sell to customers. We're ecstatic, we came for the taste, not the look of the crumpets. Our choice of toppings: the maple butter.It's amazing! The crumpet is both soft and crunchy, the maple butter is sweet and flavorful. Win!The shop's staff are superb: friendly and enthusiastic about their products, their quality, their provenance. As the customers slowly filter out we chat about all the things, have a chance to try their tasty chai, and make plans to return someday for their savory crumpets."}, {"review_id": "kvoSWqULnNjuKUEjgRffhQ", "user_id": "RJqSpP4P8LQohlZDb5-s0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I love this place mostly because I love crumpets...I love everything about them. How they taste, how they smell, how the melted butter pools in the holes...I even love how the word just rolls off my tongue. Say it. Crumpet. A beautiful word.Now onto the staff that work at The Crumpet Shop. These people are gems. Seriously. If I lived in Seattle I would get a job there just to be close to them. They are kind and quirky and funny. Totally my tribe.I am a purist so I liked the crumpet with butter, but I did taste the Maple Butter. It was from Vermont which is why it wasn't the best. Everyone knows the best maple is from Canada. I won't take a star off for that tho...but they should really look into importing some of the good stuff. Their crumpets deserve the best."}, {"review_id": "CuVwauf4__QW0SfQW7_zHA", "user_id": "xUoK9KmxHK7wKOXdDSruMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Arrived 10 min before closing for a crumpet with ricotta and lemon curd.Ridiculous.Delicious.So glad I let my coworkers convince me to try!"}, {"review_id": "52mQDDxLjH0IUhKXnCNgyQ", "user_id": "SsgDGJWBNvefjY0z8XsVCQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "For those of you wondering what a crumpet is (I understand most of you already do...), crumpets are... English Muffins!There were not a lot of shops open to eat so early in the morning here at Pike Place, but this is one of them... and there was a line already too!There are numerous options for your crumpets and we went with the following:WILD SALMON placed salmon spread and cucumbers on top of the crumpets.EGG AND CHEESE on the crumpets are also available.Their SCONE WITH LEMON CURD is VERY GOOD. That scone was fresh fresh freshly baked and the lemon curd was not too tart.The TEA is pre-brewed and available for self-serve from several thermoses. The MOCHA and the HOT CHOCOLATE are good.There are a couple of tables with chairs in the small space as well as a counter with stools underneath. We were unfortunate enough to have been surrounded by non-morning people (I am being diplomatic considering their awful attitudes) frustrated with the customer-chair ratio at the time of our visit, but this has nothing to do with the shop."}, {"review_id": "l_qOT5hmDmzIbBVWxgDl_Q", "user_id": "CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "The crumpet shop was one of my favorite pit stops in Seattle. I got the robs favorite which was absolutely delicious!!  It comes with their smoked salmon cream cheese smear and a green egg with English cheese and tomato. The green egg is a pesto infused fried egg. It sounds simple but eaten together it was delicious!!  I think the salmon smear was my favorite part. It was savory and fresh.  I guess Seattle is known for its smoked fish and it's probably the best I've had. The space is a little small so getting seats might be hard but it's really worth it to come here!   They make their crumpets in house and they have a bay window where you can watch the process. It's quite interesting. Prices are cheap and service is good. Next tome I go I'll be sure to try their sweet ones as well."}, {"review_id": "Vmh4VM28Xlf8UvL2saR5cg", "user_id": "8PzeF5qcFg07ii0KaK2FUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Overall: 4.3/5.Pretty solid crumpets.

Very cute decoration along with fresh crumpets and a nice staff.From the outside and side window you can see all the behind the scenes with them making the crumpets. Very cool watching them make it fresh.Located at Pike Place Market. Came here at 8am and there was no line, seated right away. Order: Green eggs and ham and Egg and Salmon CreamCrumpets were so yummy and fluffy. The toppings complimented the dish very well. Pretty light breakfast if you only order one dish, so I woud suggest to buy 2 dishes if you want to be really full. They also have a cafe and offer drinks as well.Overall I love this place and would come here again for breakfast when I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "JT3HnGriQeCSYN2MauJX7A", "user_id": "7ZXWYo-3qS_fiodtUPz70Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I've no idea if these are similar to English crumpets or any comparison to the ones The Queen has with tea, but the ones at The Crumpet Shop are awesome!

The space can get a bit tight but there's seating against the wall and at the bars.They have a variety of sweet and savory crumpet choices. I went for a ham with tomato (forgot to add egg) and a raspberry preserve with almond butter. The latter was soo delicious. It was like having a grown up version of PB&J. MUST TRY!

Weekday morning, you get the regulars.  People finding a moment of calm before beginning their hectic day.  They read the paper, talk shop with the employees, and know that it's only going downhill from there.Either way, you're ordering their delicious crumpets.  Not quite a biscuit, not quite a muffin or a bagel or a crescent, the crumped is warm and fluffy and substantial and light.  I got mine with the lemon curds (none of that cream cheese or butter nonsense) and it was amazing. Like eating the bottom half of a lemon meringue pie--but not nearly as indulgent.  The wife got some jam and liked it so much that she insisted on coming back a second day."}, {"review_id": "NnBnHY0aGxl7S1Mx6RKi8w", "user_id": "plOtZruZJ-rxF7VCgeS40A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "On the one hand, this place features sometimes-long waits for food that's pretty straightforward.

The best crumpets I have ever had and complemented with out of this world goodness. They ranged from simple to more fancy and damn were they good. The Vermont \"Life Changer\" earned its name and it might be what I would request for my last meal. Cream cheese, maple butter and crushed walnuts- It really took the show. I also sampled the lemon curd and ricotta, nutella and creamcheese, and the pesto, tomato and parmesan. All were very good, although I wished the lemon curd was more lemon-y. The atmosphere was super cute and nice although small and crowded.

My boyfriend wanted to try crumpets here since he saw all the raving reviews on Yelp. We were one of the few people there at 7 am, so yay for no lines! :)One of the workers recommended the green eggs on top of smoked salmon cream cheese (not entirely sure of the exact name of the crumpet). Definitely unique style of eggs - I can now say I finally tried those green eggs that Dr. Seuss was talking about LOL! I believe the eggs are made with some kind of pesto sauce, so they're this green-ish color and then they're topped off with a big slice of tomato. I only tried a couple of bites, but each bite was packed with so much favor! All the different ingredients definitely compliment each other very well. Very glad that I tried The Crumpet Shop, definitely one of the more unique places to eat at Pike's! Next time, I'll be sure to grab my own and maybe try one of the sweet crumpets!"}, {"review_id": "ruUJEHdS2E8cX0Nf5hw18w", "user_id": "6AtlFGbu3Ul2aCxCV4eNMQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Overall: Has to be my favorite quick bite place in Pike PlaceAmbiance: This place is cozy and small.

It literally melted in our mouths. The other crumpet that I want to try is crumpet with English cheese and pesto and cucumber.Drinks: I am not sure what drink options they have.
