Thanks to seeing Rachel's recent yelp pictures I decided to go and I'm glad I did! Not much to say but this is my first real bakery visit and everything was delicious and we will be back. Hazelnut praline brioche and Mardi Gras cheese cake were bomb and different worth a visit when you're down here! I believe the items change everyday so that's really refreshing!  Good vibes !!"}, {"review_id": "uPhSJAzCRhBhibucNefmDQ", "user_id": "roiM9QkHDukEVaLegYZetA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/31/2017", "text": "If I could give this place 10 stars, I totally would. This California girl fell in love with a cafe in MISSISSIPPI of all places!  The cafe au lait was a perfect balance; the sweet & salty cookie (that comes with all their cafe drinks) was divine; the ham and cheese soufflé was just the right size; the pastry cream brioche was delicate but yummy. I took home a small cylinder of Macarons (I think it contained around 15 mini macarons) and my husband finished all the night I got home. -___- I also had to (HAD TO) get some of the sweet & salty cookies as MY souvenir. I'm savoring each one, eating 1/2 a cookie at a time. ((I don't wanna run out!!! ))All around great bakery and cafe. I would recommend this place (and the fondren general area) to all of my friends and coworkers)."}, {"review_id": "70Gt0mlsiS5k1J5yVNS-hA", "user_id": "iL6zXb7iZ_TByhkt4im3hw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Great authentic breakfast spot, a rare gem in Jackson.

For the macarons, I was especially fond of the blueberry--second best thing to eating the fruit off the bush--and the chocolate and peanut butter, which is my personal weakness.Can't wait to return to sample more cookies and snap up some heftier desserts!  Luckily, I'll be up in the area more often than usual.   For those of you balking at the price, macarons would seem pricey anywhere.  For example, in NY and other larger North American cities, they are about $2.75 per and up, and in Europe, you'll pay about the equivalent.  But, you might say, we're in the 'Sip!  That's true, but today I got three little lovelies for $5.  I don't mind paying for quality pastry; life's too short to eat hydrogenated palm kernel oil and HF corn syrup day in and day out."}, {"review_id": "pLrs3rVHs1cA-JxPGXkEvQ", "user_id": "2qKOL7C7WbG_M3EOWvTFxA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/19/2015", "text": "When I am traveling for work I miss my sweetie pie. Sometimes I take her back a little somthin' from the place I was, to let her know I was thinking of her. Well, nothing says \"I was thinking of you in Jackson\" like ... French baked goods? Eh...ok, they aren't the most \"traditionally Southern\" bites I could get, but crunched for time and after a hunt proved to be tough to secure more authentic delicacies, I went with some goodies from La Brioche. Two really nice young ladies helped me out. They agreed that macaroons would likely not hold well....and recommended a variety of other sweets. I went with the orange peel cookies - these were really good. The wife appreciated the little keepsake and munched them down when I got home.Whenever I am in Jackson, I'm usually in Fondren so I'll stop in here again on the next go around and get a little something...for me this time ;D"}, {"review_id": "1G_V5vrcRLACY0Da1VmZRg", "user_id": "q00BHF0Ix9Doj8zfKPky5w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/7/2017", "text": "The best macaroons can be found here.

On the one hand, their confections are really amazing. I was first hooked by their macaroons and stayed for just about everything else. Their gelato is much-needed in Jackson but isn't quite perfect.  The prices are high. Combine five star confections, pastries and atmosphere with three star prices and some borderline three or four star gelato, you've got a four star spot.Get your pastry and coffee in the morning or stop by for a tasty sandwich for lunch.
