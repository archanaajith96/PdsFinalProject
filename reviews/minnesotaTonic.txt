Friendly service and awesome interior.Loved: Our smoothiesKale chips (sooo crunchy!)Grown up grilled cheeseDecent:The hummus platter (it was good, but for $10 was very similar to something I could make at home for half the price)Black bean soup (it was fine, just...not amazing)I also appreciated that the server was happy to allow a substitution in the smoothie. Thank you so much!Lots of space and a few big tables that are good for groups or groups with a stroller. I think everyone can find something here.

They are unique2. Everything tastes greatCompound all of this with friendly service and uber healthy menu choices (and black salt!) And you have a customer (in me) for life!

As you walk in, you may help yourself to fruit-infused water. Sit the counter, or grab the booth in back with all the throw pillows. Do order coffee, and a fresh-squeezed juice, which are made according to recipes designed to boost energy, or reduce inflammation, among others. Everything on the menu is terrific; I especially love the breakfasts, with the fresh eggs and properly thick slabbed bacon. Pepper grinders and black salt are on the table.Very nice service, good music.Expect to Shell out a good penny, and not regret it one bit."}, {"review_id": "lnFlvPTS60GNN23NddSZyw", "user_id": "cnohx8UN5XyC7Evg2zX-3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/21/2017", "text": "This place was a great find during our week long stay in the neighborhood. It has everything you need if you are looking for delicious food that is also good for you. The prices for take out are a bit high (they charge quite a bit for take out plating silverware etc) but we avoided this at least once by sitting inside.We found street parking very quickly during the week at lunch. The inside ambiance is awesome and I love all the green!! The chairs were surprisingly very comfortable. The service was excellent. The food was delicious too. I will say that it was hard to beleieve the bathroom was at the bottom of a flight of stairs. I say this because this is the Mayo Clinic area and there are tons of people here for  evaluations and treatment with lots of needs. I think lacking an accessible bathroom is problematic but maybe if you ask the staff, they may have a solution I'm not aware of. The fresh juices were great and if I'm ever back in Rochester, I most definitely plan on coming back."}, {"review_id": "yaaZEtUg_03_lxuOyeHs7w", "user_id": "aasHIo4HfTSEbHi1MKsd1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Overall a pleasant experience!! Starting: Great Bison soup special! Even though it was kinda hot outside, it hit the hunger spot. Continuing: green mango mojito with almond milk instead of coconut water! Tasted wholesome (loved the avocado taste) although the prices area a bit steep.

I happened to have my dinner there and had spicy peanut sauté with salmon. It comes with a choice of soup which was black bean soup in my case. I really liked the black bean soup which had a distinct flavor to it. Then the peanut sauté was superb, it had a blend of sweet and spices into it. This is dish is a unique signature of the innovative culinary skills of the cook which is worth appreciating. Finally I had red velvet torte with strawberry rhubarb - I did not like their dessert at all, which is why I am giving this place a 4 star. Otherwise they have a fantastic juice and smoothie bar, nice interior and a friendly staff. Take home message - great food but not to so great desserts."}, {"review_id": "l5_jgCuoodw2yqqfEdNNOA", "user_id": "0PM5oFKO29sZmL5efmHxug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Food was amazing, one of the best scrambled egg i've ever eaten.

A vegetarian and brunch lovers dream restaurant. Get a juice... and they might even charge you less if you just slightly customize one of their originally recipes ($8 vs $10). I got the Easy Being Green and traded apple for ginger and jalapeño. Perfect kick balanced the rest of the juice which was kale, cucumber, celery, an alfalfa sprouts. I also got the avocado & sprouts wrap. Garlic herb wrap, hummus, spinach, red onion, toasted sunflower seeds, alfalfa and olive oil. All around yum! I was so full I saved half for later and they gave me a to go for my juice which I finished the next morning.

I am a Mayo patient and had to be eating only particular foods only to prepare for my fasting for a bunch of testing I was having.

We barely made it because the sidewalks were so icy, but it was so worth it.I was able to choose a wonderful idea that filled me up and enjoyed two of their different juice blends.
