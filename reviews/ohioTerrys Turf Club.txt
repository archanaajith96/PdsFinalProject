I give it a 5 star review because it doesn't disappoint. The burgers are outstanding served on a big fresh bun. The menu is loaded with quality toppings. Plus plenty of other options if you don't want a burger. But do yourself a favor and get a burger.Good beer choices. Plan on waiting if you go during dinner time.And if it matters you might have to sit with a unknown customer due to table sharing.Please go and you will enjoy."}, {"review_id": "meRfwSFoPFM0HOJtWSOCqw", "user_id": "Xvv0P_0B57LoyGrVHGG_8A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "So.. who doesn't love trying a restaurant they see on Diner's, Drive-in, and Dives? Yes, I'm a Triple D kind of girl and love to try locations I see on there when the opportunity presents itself. I can say some of the places I tried on Triple D have not been that hot. However, I'm glad to report Terry's Turf is not one of them. I enjoyed their food and the location was super cool looking with all the old school lights/signs. I love how the menu is designed for you to create you own burger. It list a bunch of ingredients categorized so you can have the big you desire. I ordered a beef patty, with caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese, bacon, mustard, mayo, and ketchup. I also ordered a side of fries. My only complaint is they cook there burgers med-rare. I was a little nervous of all the pink on the inside. I prayed over it and ate it anyway. However, I ordered my 1-yr old a beef patty and nothing else. I made them take it back and cook it more on the inside as I was not going to let her eat a less cooked beef patty. This burger came out and was stacked higher than my mouth could open. Lol. I honestly didn't know what to do. I picked it up and attempted to taste whatever I could bite. It was definitely juicy and full of goodness. It was flavorful and I enjoyed it. I ate my fries with their Dill sauce and I enjoyed it. It was different but I liked it. I also ordered my daughter a side of Mac & Cheese. The Mac & Cheese was a little different. I didn't really care for it, and neither did she as she did not eat it. It was their cheese sauce you can put on burgers basically mixed in with noodles. It wasn't that good in my opinion. My daughter and I also liked that they have peanuts on the table when you are seated. We both ate a lot of those before our food came Overall, I enjoyed Terry's Turf and had a good experience."}, {"review_id": "_7rB1V-x1YsTffwlGTxXzQ", "user_id": "DecL6pewHz6H9h14Z3397w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Fun place, but the burgers were a little overrated. I'll start with the good...the staff was very inviting and our waiter took the time to explain how the menu worked which was very helpful to us first-timers. The decor is so fun and unique with various neon signs covering the entire place, inside and out. The build your own burger menu was great for people who like trying different topping combinations. Now the not so good... although the wide variety of toppings available were great, it was a little overwhelming and I had a hard time deciding what would go well together. I ended up ordering a fairly basic burger which kind of defeated the purpose in my opinion. The burger can also get very expensive since each topping costs extra. Only a few of the basic toppings are free. The burgers are also so unnecessarily messy. They have a message in their menu that you can't use a fork and knife to eat them. We tried, but there was absolutely no way we were going to be able to eat it without cutting into it. Even after cutting it apart it was so messy that it was no longer even appetizing. Overall, a very fun experience and definitely worth a visit, but don't get your hopes up."}, {"review_id": "nv1FieGXxHKxRluHj2hhNA", "user_id": "fNzgaewYge8DK2qtTPZzog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Quaint place with loads of neon signs and nostalgia everywhere!

My husband is from Cincinnati and he raved about this place so right when we got off the plane this was our first stop. A little local restaurant divey looking spot but so cool. There are tons of neon signs, old and new that are interesting to look at. We went during the day so they weren't all lit up. I'm sure at night it would look neat. Inside is not very big. Luckily for us we got there and it wasn't too busy. Usually my husband said the wait time is an hour or two. Kids loved that you could throw your peanut casings on the floor (they are used to going to places where we say don't make a mess) lol. Staff was so sweet. This is a family owned business so I believe there were all family members working. When they take your order they ask your name and do a great job of remembering who you are. Also there is not one single person helping you, they all do. They don't have tables to themselves they help everyone. Now the good part...food! There are so many way you can create your burger. I recommend getting it with some kind of sauce. We had ours with peanut garlic and it was so juicy. They also have a wide variety of cheeses to choose from. Our kids said hands down the best burger they have tried and I couldn't agree more. When we are back in town we will most definitely be hitting this spot up again!"}, {"review_id": "VEStJNKSjzy3BizZoOdaQw", "user_id": "32Q6YhYEBYWf8GhCy4MGIQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "We drive from Dayton at least every couple months to get a Terry's fix.

First thought after we left- sorely disappointed. Let me tell you why-But First..The pros: I really liked how the hostess met us outside on the front porch. It was very inviting and helped to clear up any confusion about seating ourselves, where to go, etc.-the staff is wonderful! They are all so friendly and during our visit, we had a handful of them stop by our table and say hi. They seem to enjoy being there.-peanuts were waiting at our table for us (which my son loved) - immediate seating (maybe it was the time of day we came)Cons- I think we were anticipating at least a few burger combinations that had already been put together. The entire menu is a \"build your own\" type of thing. The issue is that most of the sauce combinations aren't your normal ones- it's hard to know what will go with which one. -price: we got two burgers, only a couple of toppings, waters, one grilled cheese for my son and a side of fries. Our bill was $40! There are many other burger places that have fun combos that are less than $13 a burger. All burgers start at around $9 and every single topping is extra (besides one of two basic cheeses)- lack of kids items. This is a family place but there was only one item that would be good for kids, which was the grilled cheese. There would have been no way I could order a burger for my 4year old- they are huge.Overall- the place is fun with nice people, but the burgers are very overrated. Maybe we just couldn't figure out the right combo but that was part of the problem.What we ordered: I got the burger (with basic toppings- onion, light mayo) with Swiss cheese and the \"burgundy wine with wild mushrooms and truffles\" sauce.My husband got a burger with basic toppings and then added cheddar cheese, pineapple, bacon and the fog horn leg horn sauce. He disliked it so much that he only had maybe 4 bites."}, {"review_id": "sg1HwadGPR21jcBRhjdp7g", "user_id": "x2N8rsfVW9uIuWQHjb7gnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "Firstly, I wanted to thank Alex for  recommending this restaurant. We came here on a Saturday night. I was expecting a long wait to get seated, but we got lucky and got a table right away. They have peanuts on tables to snack on while waiting for the order. Our hamburgers were delicious! I got mine with a pineapple and some burgundy sauce. My husband didn't order extras so as not to distract from the taste of the hamburger meat. He said that it was the best hamburger he ever tasted.  The hamburger meat tasted different  somehow. When we asked what kind of ground beef they use, we were told \"from a cow\".

But, I was put off by the familiar feel of the place and the waitresses. I know they are supposed to be friendly, but they are also supposed to be professional. I just felt like I was at some one else's Grandmother's house for dinner. Even the small, cozy, overly warm bathroom gave me that impression.

In the infinite war for best burger, locals always narrow it down to two places. Terry's and Zips. They're like 10 minutes apart from each other. I always go with Terry's. There the burgers are huge with a whole gang of optional toppings and sauces you can choose from. The charm of the place is one of a kind. Very dive bar type of place. When I have family or friends come in from out of town I always tell them to check this place out. Ok... having said all that. My only gripe with this place is that the burger doesn't have a lot of flavor. Like the meat needs to be seasoned more. Just my opinion.

On arrival, it was not at all what I had envisioned. Old business signs, neon, etc graced the outside. Unique atmosphere on arrival.Walking up to the door, greeted by a gentleman asking how many in the party and for a name.  Gave it and he suggested we go in, get a drink and come back outside and have a seat for a short wait.  Fortunately, we got there just in time. Another 5 minutes delay and we would've had a much longer wait, as the crowd was growing quickly.  It took only about 7 minutes for us to get seated.Server was on the spot quickly, answered any questions we had, then left us to decide what we were going to have. It was a bit noisy, but, it was getting busy and it's very casual, so folks were eating, laughing and enjoying themselves. Bar was busy, too.Started off with beer, which they have a good selection of. My wife had a raspberry martini, which she claimed to be very good.  Appetizers we selected were the grilled asparagus and fried provolone. Both very good. Asparagus was grilled just right, not over or under done.Three of the four of us got burgers.  In the menu, it states to NO cut the burger in half, \"You can handle it\". These things were . well  BIG.  No exaggeration, the meat patty was almost an inch thick and about 4 1/2\" diameter.  You can get banana peppers and onion grilled as well as the typical toppings.  A variety of different sauces and a wide selection of cheeses.I got a side order of fries. My wife got Onion rings. Enough fries for two people.  Both the fries and onion rings were hot and very tasty. Not greasy at all.Our server checked on us regularly.  The atmosphere was, as mentioned, casual. Lots and lots of neon beer signs and other odd paraphernalia from earlier days and most from the Cincinnati area.We will most definitely go back. Recommend earlier than 6:30pm unless you don't mind waiting around 20-30 minutes for a table (all tables were high top tables).  Peanuts are available while you wait.  DO NOT FILL UP ON PEANUTS!!  The portions are big and you'll want to eat it all!  Save room for your meal!"}, {"review_id": "LIk31zsRHj5ikXODV22BTA", "user_id": "GGAQrj0psD7ETTrezAb-5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2016", "text": "Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger!  Yuuuum-O!  If you love a good old fashioned cheeseburger then hit up Terry's!  It is really hard to beat a hot off the grill burger with some cheese and a few minimal toppings.  Grab some fries and a beer, sit back and enjoy.  A few things: Call ahead - especially if you are going on a weekend - just to see approximate wait...be prepared to wait - it is worth it.Grab a handful of peanuts and enjoy while you wait on your burger.Keep your burger simple....there are lots of toppings to choose from....but at least once when you are there....keep it simple to enjoy the actual flavor and simplicity of the burger. :-)Enjoy the atmosphere - I love the neon - this is always a topic of conversation for newbee's.This is always a go to when we have company in from out of town!"}, {"review_id": "TEgc2NybR-XlPSAg-GA63w", "user_id": "-kCxMXN0_kOoQuGbSJk53Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "Everybody keeps raving about this place, so I decided to check it out.

I chose the burgundy wine with wild mushrooms and truffle and since I like mushrooms and truffle alot, I was really looking forward to it.
