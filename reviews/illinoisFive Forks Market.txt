The ambiance was lovely and the decor was great. The music was clearly an alphabetical list from someone's iPod or be computer, which I would say could be improved. The food was delicious and the wine selection impressive! We ordered a number of items on the menu to share and our server was very helpful with making our selections and deciding how many orders to get for each option.We especially enjoyed the cheese board, hummus tray (with turmeric was quite delicious!), and Manchego cheese crostini. We ordered a bunch of bottles of wine and were able to take home what we did not finish in a to-go bag. I highly recommend this place and will return if I'm ever back in Rockford!"}, {"review_id": "TnTvZz_m7BMDSg_-qv3Ung", "user_id": "09QcQYf_t1NEq_AkjJuABA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/23/2017", "text": "This place is super! I would have never found it on my own if it weren't for Yelp. I met up with my friend from Chicago here since it was a good halfway point between Madison and Chicago.First of all, I was amazed by the wine prices. I got a glass of riesling for only $5. Isn't that great? It was a decent glass of riesling too.I ordered the Salmon Salad. The salmon was perfectly cooked. There was also a citrusy taste to it, which I loved. There were pieces of fennel in it. I like fennel a lot!I'll be back and I hope to try some other things!"}, {"review_id": "Flt_7rXFf-OV_bv6m2zsig", "user_id": "Xoetf_bcE5U6o9IBzlJMWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/7/2017", "text": "Found this place while up in Rockford, saw good things on Yelp and we went. The food was amazing, as was the wine. The service was also amazing. I'd want to make this our monthly date night spot if it wasn't so gosh darn far away. I can't say enough about this place.

We ordered the featured panini with the five forks salad and the turkey chipotle panini with fries. The turkey chipotle panini was a lot better than the featured one. The chipotle sauce on it was a great touch with a hint of spice. I also love that they bring bread and oil/vinegar to your table ahead of time. I've also been here for dinner and it was delicious as well, I would definitely try their crab cakes! Another great thing about five forks is their wine selections, they also sell it by the bottle AND they don't overcharge you like other restaurants do! They even give a percentage of wine bottles sold to a charity..so it's basically a win-win for everyone!"}, {"review_id": "mhk4JeOa7VRSBaXvwk5F_Q", "user_id": "jihxtuVVdowIfiKwNtuapg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Pleasantly surprised at the quality of food that you can get here in Rockford. From the appetizers/tapas to the main course everything was flavored perfectly and nice and hot when it came to the table. My group especially enjoyed the fact that you could get a bottle of wine for under $20. My only regret was not discovering this place until the last part of my work trip."}, {"review_id": "u9TFlPF0bdvHNdqAc_KppA", "user_id": "Pvx2qXSzzc-9gxRQ7lpo_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "This was an amazing find on Yelp!!  When you make a reservation they place a sign on the table welcoming you!  Scott was our waiter and was so helpful to answer our questions and make recommendations.  The crab cakes and bacon-wrapped dates were amazing small plates!  For dinner we had Pork Ragu with Fuscilli pasta and Salmon with grilled Brussel Sprouts.  For dessert, I highly recommend the Napoleon and Pistachio gelato!  Simply amazing flavor combinations and the presentation was truly gourmet!  A new favorite restaurant for sure!"}, {"review_id": "F6AjJkrfKF4_ucXImwaZqA", "user_id": "k39vmETGp6X6Gi_mblPT6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/2/2017", "text": "I only hear great things about this restaurant. My friend decided to take me out for my birthday and this is one of the few places I have never been in town. She says they have really great food and I usually trust her judgement on food. When I arrived, the place had already dimmed the lights and made the ambiance more of an intimate feel. The wait staff was really nice and tentative, which is a plus because I feel a lot of servers can't read body language and this place was great about it. The menu is pretty small but i feel that they make dishes based on whats in season and that is fine by me. We ordered a few smaller plates such as shrimp and Napa cabbage, crab cake and corn fritters, and brussel sprouts. I wasn't too sure about it, but she helped me change my mind about the vegetable and I can honestly say I like them now or at least the way Five Forks makes them. I also had the shrimp and bacon risotto which I will recommend to everyone. They gave you 3 large shrimp and the rice was perfectly cooked with the bacon. We also decided to get the strawberry creme brulee which was very delicious. The strawberry pieces were very subtle and did not over power the natural brulee taste.Overall, the food, the customer service, and  the ambiance all came together to make a great dining experience for my friend and I. We will be coming back for more in the near future."}, {"review_id": "UTi-nOlv5Rp_UiLE9R65Jg", "user_id": "1BSa49vSWdqvWjyvi269DQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "One of the best places to eat and drink in Rockford!  The atmosphere is very comfortable.

This restaurant has been always a must-to-stop place for me when I have business in Rockford. We were there for dinner and it was a day that we felt left out. Gotta ask for dessert menu...check please....no refilling water....no recommendations...no spending time with customers. Not sure what was going on? Saw some reviews had the same comments. I went there with my friend and by the time we walked out the door. We brought up the same thing....\"Did you feel like it wasn't great like before?\" Lol. Maybe there were some changes in management? Passion? Drive?Not sure though. Anyway, my excitement has gone down...sad."}, {"review_id": "iLaedmILvcrG_dGucxAuaQ", "user_id": "wouQapwvBzp6S8rKYPnECg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "amazing cocktails and small plates.

I opted to sit at a table instead of the bar and service was very different. I ordered my salmon dish and it was bad enough to make me write an update to my last review. The salmon portion was very small and dry. It was also lacking in sauce. The mushroom and leek mixture was cold while the very few pieces of potatoes were piping hot. It's as if the chef made the mushroom mixture and then realized that potatoes hadn't been started, and then found that there was only one potato left....I'm all for gourmet food, but $19 for this dish the way it was presented and prepared was a rip off. I hope this was just an off day, but a $50 dinner for sad salmon with two glasses of wine just leaves a bad taste in my mouth."}, {"review_id": "XzoQ8WJVKv6IcMh0lid2Ig", "user_id": "3RNBGnMyasSI2N8b_pisDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "I had the halibut and squash it was wonderful.

Sadly this was the worst dining that I have had in a long time! We first ordered the manchego crustini which was ok and it went downhill from there. The salmon was too salty and the beets purée was so odd and I love beets. The Brussels sprouts were the worst I have had, I love Brussels so much, they were hard and horrible. The steak which was quoted to be 6-8 ounces but was 4 ounces on a good day. The jambalaya was the worst thing on the menu by far, so salty, tomatoey spicy but without flavor and my husband who will eat anything could not finish it!"}, {"review_id": "X9q8Emy4WAF5XfMWB4byFQ", "user_id": "mRlxBKqPSambDQ-ZPzxcQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Yummy food.
