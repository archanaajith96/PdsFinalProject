Sloppy customer service. Our server was attempting to bring us our juice but after a hopeless search, she left it on the counter for us to get. No one cared. The food was shockingly tasteless. The flavors were just not there. The Highway to Kale salad was warm but underwhelming and tastes blah. The Bollywood bowl was horribly awful. The chicken pieces in it were cold, chewy and inedible.

On the plus side, their food is consistent, healthy, and priced okay. So I've eaten here regularly.That being said, I've eaten here dozens of times since they first opened, and am constantly blown away by how rough around the edges the experience continues to be. Whether it's long lines while they don't put a second cashier to help out, being interrupted mid-order so the cashier can answer the phone and start dealing with the phone order, receiving the wrong item, etc, it goes on - I've yet to come here and have the visit go without issue. This last time, we wanted to get extra napkins while eating, only to find there were no napkins anywhere on the tables, or on the floor at all. I went to the counter, where I waited for several minutes before someone came over and then told me they're trying to reduce their paper waste and that napkins are only behind the counter. Basically, just wanting to use an extra couple napkins became a laughable 5+ minute process. Seems like a pretty basic part of eating at a cafe is the ability to use a napkin without it being an ordeal. It just kinda illustrates how the customer experience has never been something they've struck me as excelling at over my visits.Anyway, I feel like eating here on occasion, and would more if it wasn't such a consistently unimpressive experience each time I did. Good food though!"}, {"review_id": "JHmT0fsLO5JzPHtsYzbv1A", "user_id": "V985yOjZFlhek2wFJjsebA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Going to try to keep this short(er) and sweet!:I think Laughing Planet Cafe is a success because it's been consistent every time I've been. There's nothing worse than wondering what variation of a dish you might get. I love having a healthier option in Midtown and I absolutely love their bowls. Try their Thai bowl or Bollywood bowl!Being able to make anything on the menu meatless with ease is super nice. Their flavor combos are right on and I love the number of options they offer as toppings/sauces for their bowls and burritos like Cholula, chili sauce, sriracha, nutritional yeast, liquid aminos and so on. Ordering at the cashier and grabbing your number makes it fairly quick and a great spot to grab a casual meal.

We had the tufu Thai bowl, the Korean BBQ pork bowl and a roasted vegetable quesadilla.With all three dishes, the flavors were simply delightful and tantalizingly complex.

Soy Ginger braised pork, kale, roasted delicate squash, fluffy steamed jasmine rice, pickled daikon, carrot, and beets, with a miso-orange sauce. I started to enjoy each component separately but finally gave in and mashed it together. Flavor level 10 unlocked!Seriously get in and eat this bowl now. I'd actually eat another one for dinner!

Tried the Harvest Bowl as recommended by the cashier, who was so kind and helpful and wonderful - which is why I'm giving five stars (see below). The Harvest Bowl was delicious. Even without the dressing, the veggies were flavorful and vibrant. Add the dressing, if you want a spicy garlic pick-me-up. It's really good either way. On the whole, the food is a solid 4.5 stars. They deliver what's expected: feel-good food. The .5 extra goes to fantastic customer service. She was friendly and authentic. Very accommodating! She subbed the tempeh with some brussels they had on hand to suit my request. I also got a chocolate hazelnut cookie (gluten-free, vegan). It was so-so. Next time I'll just get an extra Harvest Bowl! Btw, the burritos looked really good and seemed a popular option with the dine-in folks."}, {"review_id": "wVzm8z_1i_ZTbNHueGEfpQ", "user_id": "oT_q0nuh6lDe6LG_HierWg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "One of the things I stress about reviews is that if you've had one bad experience it shouldn't spoil every other experience you've had that's been good. So for me, I've wanted to like Laughing Planet for so long, and ultimately, I would have to say it's not at the top of my recommendations list from several visits I've had.I love to eat healthily, and I love great ingredients. I think that's the first key to Laughing Planet's success in town has been their great ingredients. This is what I appreciate about them. But unfortunately, the biggest miss for me is when putting those ingredients into action. I've had hits and misses every time I've been here. Usual favorites of mine that I won't eat here, and then things I'd never try that I ended up loving. The consistency is what I wish I had with Laughing Planet. Specifically, food that took incredible ingredients and made better profiles out of it.Additionally, on my most recent visit, I ordered a bowl to-go. Service was friendly, but ultimately I waited very long for my order. Longer than 20 minutes, which I wouldn't generally complain about, it was just an addition to some negative experiences I'd like to share. BUT, the bowl was very good.Overall, I wish I could give a better review, but because of several experiences, I have to say 3 stars. 3/5 food, 4/5 location, 4/5 service."}, {"review_id": "GPiGhvsyQiPHcpRA3NDCug", "user_id": "hWCMjfymhc1p8EIeoKRikg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I've come here multiple times with sooo many different people that have an even wider difference in tastes...

First I love that they offer vegan options, tons of items on the menu can also be modified to be made vegan. They once had some kind of drunken vegan red beans on special and they were super delicious.  (Please add them to your regular menu!) They also have a Bollywood bowl that has a delicious sauce that I love, however they have changed the ingredients since I have first started to eat here and I'm not a big fan of the chickpeas, I will definitely sub out for black beans next time I order it. They are always very accommodating to all our requests. I had a build your own taco bowl the other night and it was amazing... However, sometimes at night the food comes out cold, like just came out of a refrigerator cold. If you order the weekly special bowl as a burrito, they charge you for the price of the bowl but it is not as much food as you would get in the bowl. If you omit the meat and tofu or tempeh offered they don't give you extra beans or rice to make up for it, instead you just get a super tiny burrito. On one occasion the server noticed how small my burrito was and said she would remake it, only for it to be filled with about a cup full of guacamole! Not only did it make the food ice cold but it was awful... We have recently started coming back and the food seems to have improved. I still rate laughing planet with 5 stars because they have a unique variety of options for all diet types, they offer vegan cookies, and when they get the food right and it's hot, it's goooood!*****************************************************updated review as of 12/9/17 Came in with my husband for two diy taco bowls no pork and no cheese, sub extra beans and rice... we used our laughing planet stamp cards since we had two filled up... so technically dinner tonight was free. So far so good. We wait for our food to come out and it does rather quickly. (They don't really have to cook anything for the bowl just assemble and deliver). The corn tortillas were cold to the touch and the inside was broken pieces of tortilla... my husband asked for replacements with no issue, although now we have our food getting cold while we wait for fresh tortillas. They forgot to put lettuce on our bowls, I request some on the side. By the time our new tortillas came out, our food was not hot. These bowls are almost $10 each, and we basically get steamed rice, black beans, pico de Gallo and guacamole. Super disappointed in our food this evening! We are not really sure why this place is always hit or miss, especially at night time. Btw, it's a Saturday night but they only had 3 other tables so it wasn't busy. Bummed about our dinner this evening. The gal who took our order was super helpful in trying to fix everything but it puts a damper on things when you have to keep getting up to request things that should have come out correctly to begin with!"}, {"review_id": "rCoH5N_CjWilq1qinjYQyw", "user_id": "PmPomRc8p_918r5tVoh5Rw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "So so sad the autumn bento is gone.

Super healthy, creative and colorful concoctions that taste delicious. My daughter and I both tend to try the vegetarian version of the weekly or current seasonal special when we go and my husband is a creature of habit- he gets the house-made veggie chili every time. On our most recent visit, I decided to go with something off of the main menu, the Cuban burrito! There is a Cuban restaurant in Southern California that we used to go to called Versailles. I loved their vegetarian dish of black beans, rice and fried sweet plantains. When I took my first bite of the Cuban burrito at Laughing Planet, it brought me back to Versailles. It was really that good! A yummy combination of black beans, plantains, yams, rice, pico de gallo and chipotle BBQ sauce.... delicious! I have attempted to recreate some of the Laughing Planet dishes at home to no avail. Until I get them down, I will continue to be a regular here."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/laughing-planet-cafe-reno?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
