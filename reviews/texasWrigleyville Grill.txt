The bun was soft and complimented the perfectly prepared weiner. On top of the hot dog was relish (bright green), onions, and tomatoes. Everything combined for a wonderful experience.I also ordered the pork gyro. The bread was the appropriate texture and density for gyro. The pork was moist and held great flavor. The tomato on top appeared freshly cut, as did the onions. The taziki was very creamy. It wasn't tangy, more greek-yogurty.The staff is extremely friendly here and it just adds to the great experience. Definitely recommended.Soft drinks are neither Pepsi nor Coke, but rather Hawaiian Punch, RC Cola, and IBC on tap (amongst others)."}, {"review_id": "H02r_LjOBovBTHCAz2qV_g", "user_id": "teI7QTbSLvWdybSMl3905A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Sorry been eating Chicago dawgs all my life , this has the right Chicago ingredients, but not how they combine it , they know they are not putting enough tomato on the dawgs , a \" sprinkle of red \" too much relish , not the right combination of onion and relish and tomatoes making them taste sweet with the relish  .., should have slices of  tomatoes not \" red sprinkles \" Seems they are saving on the tomatoes and overpowering the dawg with sweet relish Texas friend took me there to try it , the dawg was good as a hotdog but it's not a true \" Chicago hotdog\"  as it's combined Just google Chicago hot dogs which gives you idea of how a dawg should look .

They have two large high top tables that sit about 10 or so people and a few other low tables. There's great photos on the wall all about Chicago, which is where the owner is from.They serve hot dogs, gyros, sandwiches, salads and sides. We asked the young lady behind the counter for their popular items but couldn't answer all of our questions since it was only her second day. She did her best and got answers for us. On this trip, we tried the Chicago hot dog, the famous Italian beef hot dog and a pizza puff. You can order these by itself or as a combo. We sub the regular fries to chili fries for only a $1 more. The food didn't take too long and they bring the food directly to your table.The Chicago hot dog was really good but rather small. I wasn't too fond of the Italian beef hot dog even though many people recommended this. I had the sweet peppers (for $.50 more) and the sauce on the side. It may have made a difference because the beef didn't sit in the sauce for too long to pick up more flavor. My kids liked the pizza puff, it was like a hot pocket but better. The chili cheese fries was good. We didn't finish everything so we asked to take it home. A container cost $.25 extra but you can ask for a foil and paper bag at no cost.The young lady and owner came to our table to check on us and clear our table. Everyone was friendly and that's what makes you want to go back to an establishment."}, {"review_id": "jc43lXDBZYAKHB0ZfkM4EA", "user_id": "k2RPYM69kQRKuVlK97H6JA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "You know a Chicagoan by one of a few ways -- their favorite deep dish pizza place, their favorite baseball team, and how they like their Italian beef (dipped with giardiniera all over, always). The owners of Wrigleyville Grill are straight from the Midwest's Best, and I should know --- I'm from that part of the U.S. While the menu is straight out of Chi-town, you will have to wade through the odd tourists to get your Chicago fix. Note to those new to Chicago foods --- please, please, please don't talk about that one time you spent a layover for 4 hours. (It doesn't count).I am fiercely loyal to Maxwell's Polishes, Lou Malnati's, and Portillo's, so I cannot with all earnestness give Wrigleyville my wholehearted 5 star rating with those top dogs roaming around the food scene. However, given the rarity of seeing Chicago food represented in San Antonio, I must give credit where it is due. The Italian beef with giardiniera, my preferred order with a heavy-handed pour of fries, is absolutely the best. Am I willing to pay nearly double for it than I would have in Chicago? Absolutely, because it is so difficult to find in San Antonio. The food, I can definitely vouch for.The owners are avid Cubs fans, so my fellow White Sox buds, play your cards right here. Know your territory, if you get my drift. The decor is quintessential Chicago deli feel, and if it were not for the Alamo Brewhouse just outside the doors, I would have felt quite at home.Definitely worth a visit if you're feeling a little homesick as a Chicagoan."}, {"review_id": "i_ArgS-khzF0KHyB_9xYMw", "user_id": "04tSWe_sxI_BdhsfgV6dow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Very friendly staff and provided me with recommendations.

New York and Chicago have their pockets of authenticity but that is a little far to go for food. Randomly stumbled upon this place and wow! The owner is Greek and stays true to his roots making a real Gyro  with real pork. None of this spam-ish looking \"lamb/beef\" concoction that you almost always find at \"Mediterranean\" restaurants. This tastes like home. The place is clean. Kid friendly. The Chicago style hot dog is great. The Greek Salad and fries are a perfect side.

My Chicago friends swear on the authenticity of this place, I couldn't confirm since I only flew over Chicago, but I do like their Italian Sausage, it is very fulfilling.

I really did like my Chicago dog (without the relish). The pizza puff or I call it pizza pocket, because it reminded me of a hot pocket, was meh... wouldn't order it again, but would eat it if there wasn't anything else. The fried mushrooms were gross. They were fried perfectly on the outside, but old and slimy on the inside. I love fried mushrooms and these I ate about 4 and threw them in the trash. So why a 4 star when it should be a 3. Two things. The cashier pretty much read the entire menu to me. She gave great explanations and was very friendly. The memorabilia was cool. Yes I said it. Right out of the mouth of a Cardinals fan. Cool place, nice location being tucked around the corner from Twin Peaks. I would come back to try something different or maybe back for another Chicago dog because it was delicious."}, {"review_id": "2iy7rWQsyA-m8rUAUC9kYQ", "user_id": "jCwMSHrjiYg6HXunnrufUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Really good food !

So when my wife and I found ourselves in San Antonio and saw Wrigleyville, we just had to go and check it out.We were flying out the next morning and have already turned in our rental car so when I checked out Yelp and it said our hotel was about a mile away, I knew we would walk there. Why not take an Uber, Lyft or taxi, you say? Nah, us (former) long suffering Cubs fans are used to pain and suffering...the long walk would just make the food taste better...or so I thought.We arrived around 8 PM, close to getting \"hangry\" after a long, warm hike from our hotel. After perusing the menu, my wife ordered the Chicago dog combo and I ordered the Italian beef. The lady behind the counter proceeded to ask me what seemed like 20 questions about what I wanted on my Italian beef...and being \"hangry\" by this point, I went ahead and just changed my order to another Chicago dog.The Chicago dog was close to what I remembered...although I recall not as soft a bun...something more substantial. The hand cut fries were on the money though. My wife, who grew up Minnesota, tried the iced tea and it was way too sweet for her tastes...guess their iced tea wasn't quite Chicago style.Dinner for 2 was a good value at less than $12. I asked about a military discount and was told they don't offer it. Oh well. All in all, a decent experience and it was good to see all those Chicago sports paraphernalia up on the walls."}, {"review_id": "3WQWxWWDApG1BBXOsTx9kw", "user_id": "5w-ly0Vln0imraXKn4nZEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/24/2017", "text": "Now his is an interesting story how I found out about this place. I meet the owner at a TV station and tried one of the hotdog's there and it was great. So I said I will come by and try it in the store as well. And that's where I am now.The staff is very friendly and let me test the beer before I choose to get some. The Goose islands is a nice beer and if you like beer you should try it for sure. I got the full loaded hotdog and it as well was great. This is hotdog heaven if you ask me and if I ever make it to Chicago, this is what I will compare it too. Now the hotdog buns are a story on it's own as they get them from Chicago shipped, not sure if they get dropped from an airplane or how they get here but they are great and as I am going to make a Texas style dog on the weekend when I can not visit this place, I just bought a box of hotdog buns as well. Not sure if this is a menu item or they just sold me the box as I told the owner at the TV station what my plan is and that his hotdog buns are the perfect buns for my plan, but I got them and this would give them two extra stars if you ask me, oh wait, you just asked me as you are still reading my review.Ok long story short, you need to visit this place and get a Chicago hotdog ASAP, and a Goose island as well."}, {"review_id": "sPHURC4RB3EgluoRfwXHQg", "user_id": "ZUn6GjjkWcpGQIUhRBy7bg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Friendly staff, helpful to newbies, decent menu options, food wasn't bad, nice decorations and not too tacky; they charge extra for a to-go box (unnecessarily cheap), the entire time we were there they played the same infomercial on the TV, and one of their customers had to wait 5 minutes at the front counter with no help.
