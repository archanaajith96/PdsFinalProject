Nearly everything is the same except this location has waffles and cooks the homefries differently. I enjoy Charlie's homefries better, but it is just my preference and these were good as well! I also enjoy the Charlie's atmosphere better, yet once again it is not because Margies is bad. Parking is a bit difficult and confusing, but once you get into the restaurant you will have a breakfast you can't forget!"}, {"review_id": "ccz1nW5KX19tIVpRgW_BsQ", "user_id": "pW9LvtC-hZ0PRAOUn7aZ2A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We returned to Margie's Dream this past Sunday. This experience was much different than the last.We sat in the back- the booths are next to overflow refrigerators which cooks come out and take out what they need- well the smell that came out from that frige- OMG- it smelled like something died in there- sour rotten milk smell. Also- looking up- to see all kinds of cobwebs in the corners (see pic). NOT a clean place. Service was also a disappointment- coffee was not refilled and ordered items was not delivered.I am taking this place off my rotation."}, {"review_id": "c-yJJ6dQF0En7OLrxJdBVA", "user_id": "cMDbSh3CGfal56oYjBFIEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Best diner I've found in a while - definitely worth stopping by.  I absolutely love hash browns - I think they're very hard to find in New England!

Two degrees outside....nonetheless, this was the place to be. It is a small dive, much like a mom and pop place. I had the hot chocolate and it was really good, the whipped cream and Christmas sugar stole the show. The main star was the camp fire skillet. This had hot sausage, sweet sausage, jalapenos, hash browns, pepper Jack cheese and eggs. Everyone needs to try this!!!!! It was spicy just the way I like it. The staff were super friendly and glad we stopped by. Don't forget to try the potato pancakes, it's like fried mashed potatoes,so flavorful. It is indeed a dream."}, {"review_id": "EPk-ulzsej4Ts4MfroKL6A", "user_id": "klVArEc1ufXy_qcoFoUOSQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2017", "text": "Excellent breakfast place.*Note: there is a $10 minimum for credit or debit card use.I fully intend to go back and absolutely expect to bump my rating to five stars. The service today was a slow, but the place was full and a five-person party walked in and placed a to-go order immediately before I got there. I spent about an hour there when I typically expect to spend half that at a diner, so the timing is what kept it from five star for me.The eggs benedict were fantastic. The eggs were perfectly poached with a nice runny yolk (though you could order it hard if you prefer) and minimal if any water, they didn't skimp on the delicious hollandaise, and the ham was excellently grilled.For my side, I had the potato pancakes. I was expecting something akin to a latke: shredded potato base. Instead, it was more mashed potatoes griddle-grilled into a pancake with a thin layer of crust on each side and a mushy interior. It was far superior to what I had been expecting.  It was also very flavorful, excellent alone or dipped in the hollandaise.My hot chocolate came with a \"dash of Patriots colors\" because of the Super Bowl tomorrow. That made me smile, both the comment and the jimmies on the whipped cream. That's the kind of atmosphere here - casual and very friendly. The staff was pleasant, but so, too, were the other customers. It was a very cordial atmosphere, reminding me of the show Cheers.Again, I fully intend to return and definitely expect to bump it up to five stars."}, {"review_id": "rghgDIZlKFNqQTy7VPzNzg", "user_id": "oWx7A9EEkptOn1RuQTWC5A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/16/2017", "text": "What a great little find in Manchester.  Seems to be almost a converted house into breakfast joint. The breakfast portions here are large and delicious and the service was good, especially being a busy and rainy Mother's Day, our server was attentive and kind and my coffee mug was always full.  I ordered one of their breakfast skillets which was awesome, I think it was called the caveman and had steak tips and sausage in it. The reason for 4 vs 5 stars on this place is it is very small and there is not much room. with the rain there was a crowd of people all pushed to the back corner, which is also where the bathroom is located. on a sunny day this wouldn't be an issue as people could wait outside but being poor weather you kinda get the feeling to hurry up as people are watching you and waiting, just be aware of you are going on a day with inclement weather. There is a counter area and I think maybe 5 booths."}, {"review_id": "Uc-fT3yAvOvvfDmbM44vIw", "user_id": "QpB2bjFjLYYKHemg1-Weng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/2/2017", "text": "Good breakfast/diner joint. Friendly staff, decent food, good coffee. Currently my number two breakfast place behind The Red Barn diner in the Manchester area. I've had plenty of meals here. Go with the hash browns or potato pancakes for a starch. Their hash isn't really special just your standard run of the mill so if you're looking for homemade hash this isn't your spot. Otherwise everything else is good. The only negative thing I have to really say about this place is that a lot of the food just seems under-seasoned I find myself using the salt shaker a bit, especially on the eggs. Not a bad spot, clean, friendly, decent food, and of course good coffee."}, {"review_id": "zP6MbvpMti9XO0OyGVUW6w", "user_id": "pALZ7UVlhhTrLLMleGopQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/3/2017", "text": "Food in abundance!

It's everything I need in breakfast. Although I've only been here once and tried one meal, I can eat that every weekend. Perfect amount of veggies, meat and SPICY! [insert fire emoji here ;)]. So satisfying that I don't even care if this restaurant looks like a crammed living room. No but it really does. If you're at all claustrophobic.... Maybe just come alone and take up the whole table? Idk but you should just go. The entrance is so tight that you have to walk to the back of the restaurant (which is admittedly only like five steps away because this place is that small) and wait next to the bathroom (bad for two reasons - 1) it's not pleasant in general & 2) people keep asking you if you're in the line). Despite the space constraint and next-to-the-bathroom wait, I'll endure it all and return for more. All the other skillets sound amazeballz so I'll def have to go down the list and check them all out!My friends got some special deviled Eggs Benedict, western omelet, breakfast sandwich and pancake. All was well except for the pancake apparently. I didn't try it myself but I guess the pancake wasn't fluffy and potentially over-cooked. Won't let it hinder my skillet love tho :*"}, {"review_id": "QXygMcvLkamCsqsYM98JfA", "user_id": "cctZ5e0OLd1g0jNdRk5Buw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/27/2016", "text": "This is a hidden gem diner located in the industrial area of Manchester. We followed the GPS after finding it on Yelp but because of the area, we almost started to doubt we were heading to the right direction. However, the GPS was right and we found a small blue residential looking building converted into a diner. It's a nice homey place with warm and friendly service, and the food blew us away. We really didn't have much high expectations so we were all pleasantly surprised by how every dish we ordered was excellent! The Florentine Egg Benedict was amazing, for this price it's a steal($7.29)!!! It was just as great as my favorite egg Benedict from Restaurant L'Avenue in Montreal, which is more expensive anyway. But what we loved most was Camp Fire Skillet, it was perfectly seasoned with a nice spicy kick to it. It's too out of the way for me to come again but I would love to eat here if we happened to be in the area."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/margies-dream-manchester?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
