Sorry, kind of. Frankly, I'd go there on occasion as well, much singing and dancing!If, however, you hear the word \"gyro\" and not only know it is not pronounced as in \"gyroscope\", but also find your mouth watering at the thought of lamb and beef, with garlic and at least two \"secret ingredients\". If you think of drinking the beautific taziki on its own. If you think, \"a half order\" of French fries should be more than enough for four people. And most importantly, you are hungry and wish to not be, for a while, welcome home. Welcome to the Greek House.The gyros are thick stacked with the thinly sliced ultimate meat on a stick. Thin slices which still drip with juicy goodness. I've spoken already to the greatness of the fresh made daily taziki sauce. And the pita, while a normal enough, is perfect for holding the hot mess in your hands.Go on a game day (boomer) and find the restaurant wrapped with people, unless you don't mind missing kickoff, when the place is nearly empty. But worry not, even in that holy moment, still the Greek House shall serve you with pleasure.Some people make the mistake of purchasing a gyro or two to \"take home\". They may not realize the sea of traffic the are about to wade into. But many's the time I've seen someone at the wheel of their car, parked by traffic, digging into one of their \"take home\" sandwiches. Only, maybe this was their plan, no need to stock in provisions from some gas station with the smell of Greek House filling one's senses.The prices go up from time to time. But no matter the price for your gyro, it's the most meat you've had for that money, and it's high quality and delicious. The store has changed ownership, and I miss both of the original owners, who have pictures hanging on.a couple of walls, but the new ones haven't messed anything up much, and there is double the seating there used to be, so they have that going for them."}, {"review_id": "a6LO4x3OOpmA3oHPJuXtrA", "user_id": "c1vOINMzNjMKYuPSpVORHg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I want to give this place 5 stars for the size of the portions, the taste of the food but the cleanliness and atmosphere deterred me.

I've been coming here for the last 15 years and it is THE PLACE for gyros. I hold every gyro I eat to the Greek House standard. In the last couple of years they have changed owners (the previous owners were a family from Greece that went back every summer). Luckily, not too much has changed since the passing of the torch. There are only a handful of items on the menu. I usually get the child's plate and add pita. This is the smaller version of the gyro plate that would feed 2 adults lol. The gyro is thinly sliced and nicely flavored. The pita cut into triangles and heated on the griddle. Their tzatziki sauce-perfect balance of yogurt, cucumber, and garlic. The plate comes with a mini side salad that's also delicious (kalamata olive, feta, onions, tomato, and a herb oil dressing). Their fries are from a frozen batch but offer a nice complement to the entire meal. I make it a point to stop in every time I'm back in town. You definitely should as well!!"}, {"review_id": "-nDnTTI_evJX36_t3_eUEQ", "user_id": "wGQ04PPsSCWb_Tlap5PT8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2017", "text": "All of the yes. I was a non traditional OU student back in the day but that doesn't mean I missed out on the staples of my college experience. Thankfully, the Greek House was a regular for me. I walked in tonight after setting up for a MATHCOUNTS competition and immediately felt at home. It's a small space with a very short menu because why mess with greatness? When you walk in you are simultaneously at the order counter and in the dining area. This is a CASH ONLY place, but if you forget, there is an ATM onsite that charges a hefty fee, of course. The food, oh my lordy, the delicious food. If you're starving or sharing with another hungry person, you can order the gyro plate and have enough to share. The child's plate is plenty of food, especially if you add pita. Food comes out fast but plate by plate if you are with another person because they serve their food hot and fresh. Again, it's a small space but so worth crowding elbows!"}, {"review_id": "XuDO4g6gn0encez3CgN8Eg", "user_id": "sCSX64l4EkV4e4DaQfKnqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "This place has the most delicious gyro ever!

You either pick the gyro plate or pita sandwich, and although it's probably not the best Greek/Mediterranean out there (maybe even 2nd place in Norman) it's definitely one of the best value meals in town. Experienced visitors order the kid sized platter or you could also share the platter and even the sandwich for a just few bucks each, just remember, it's only cash and don't even think about using the on-site ATM. All told, because of the consistent quality, authentic tzatziki and pita bread, quick service, inexpensive meal, and large portions, Greek House should continue to satisfy scores of OU students and Norman locals for 30+ more years."}, {"review_id": "wKm7MIWljKw-GQA_AOsxQg", "user_id": "Mho6gO8tJ5QQ3ZSruhBjBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "I liked the food there.  If you order French fries be prepared to share them with someone.  Also make sure you are really hungry because they will load you up with food.  The meat and sauce were very good."}, {"review_id": "7kIUoq_jeCG02K9WZ9kbGQ", "user_id": "AGCjUwJHUh0u1TvT-CrxhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "Fantastic food at a fantastic price.

This place has been in business since the early 80's and was sold about 3-4 years ago to another Greek family who have tried to keep it as Antonio and Helen did. The new owners know that they have hard core Greek House fans and they wanted to keep them and yet offer a bit of updating for a younger group. I feel that they have been successful in their plan as the place is still busy all the time. I get the child's plate with extra pita. This comes on a smaller plastic plate with fries, salad and gyro meat as well as a small container of tzatziki. You'll need to order you a side of pita as it doesn't come with it. There have an adult version that comes with the same only larger portions and pita. You can order it no fries, double salad as well. Place your order at the register, get your own drinks if you're doing soda or tea. They do have beer and that will be brought to your table. Get your drinks at the drink stand & find a seat. Its a small restaurant with tables for 2 - 4 seating. The new owners have opened a small area off the main dining area for over flow and have rearranged the tables around to give other seating options. Your food will be brought to you by the effecient staff. You can either clean up after yourself (trash can behind the curtain) or not. Other things added by the new owners is an ATM (they take checks and cash), freshened up the decor with paint, curtains. One thing I do appreciate they have done is to honor Antonio and Helen who retired and moved back to their Greek homeland. They keep a picture of them in the restaurant and when they recently took a trip to Greece, they visited them, made a video and posted it to their facebook page. That means alot to this frequent guest. They have added a Fiesty Feta Cheese appetizer to the menu. Feta Cheese mixed with spicy spices and served with what can only be called as fried small pita chips. Both are good and we usually get the 8 oz. size. This is a good value for the price. They pile the plates high with gyro meat that they freshly slice off the cone and salad. Fresh salad, not bagged in plastic salad. The salad comes with onions, a sliced tomato and dress with greek dressing - oil & herbs and a cube of feta cheese (2 cubes on the adult plate) and a greek olive (adult plates get 2). Parking can be tight, but there is a parking lot behind the restaurant across the alley you can use."}, {"review_id": "tZ1KvnEVp8mEjv1ihDjiyA", "user_id": "0_3KQG5DnBAxG6O8CC1t3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/11/2015", "text": "I stopped in here for lunch on a Friday in November. A friend of mine who is an OU alumnus has always raved about this place, but, despite my being in Norman on numerous occasions to visit my in-law, I've just never gotten around to trying it.  So, I finally did.Gyros was good.  Huge portions and thus a great value. That's the one thing I've heard about this place over and over is the huge gyros they serve.  I think the Tzatziki could be better, but outside of that I enjoyed my food very much.  French fry portion is huge. Two people could easily share a small order of fries.Service was friendly. Clientèle was friendly.It's what you expect from most gyros shops when it comes to atmosphere and décor. Too many tables crammed into too small of a space.  A kitchen that makes use of the space it can, but doesn't appear particularly practical, and so forth.  This isn't some upscale Mediterranean restaurant.  It's a typical dive gyros place.   The heat coming off of the vertical broilers at the front counter was astonishing.  It's rather nice on a cold wet November day, but it has to make this place rather uncomfortable on a hot August afternoon.If you like gyros then bookmark this place for your next visit to Norman."}, {"review_id": "LIWyMPhCisfCoZQQGxzc7g", "user_id": "9N8hd9SAsu8QApCIvSi4cg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Best GYRO in the world!  Big portions and the place  hasn't changed since 1992.

The platter also includes fries which looked yummy. We also got a Greek salad which was simple and tasty.   Hummus was so good with the homemade puta bread!  I can't even say how good the  baklava was. There are no words.
