It's in the Asher Building which has been looking for an identity. The coffee shop is upstairs in the lobby of where a church used to be located and now large private civic space. What I like about it is it's very quiet in the early afternoon. The plain coffee is pretty good and not expensive. I'm thinking the baristas are also part of the meeting room set up crew. There is an elevator, if stairs aren't useable for you."}, {"review_id": "Xcwhm-perc2QTdBNuxGIpA", "user_id": "UxFvZH_EfhC6qyUMLikS-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2017", "text": "Cute little local place upstairs in the Asher Building.  I had a double espresso latte that was outstanding.  There were a three locals having their morning coffee, and we had an enjoyable conversation with them and the lady behind the counter before we hit the road Westward.  WINTER WARNING.  The city of Cheyenne does not have a single snowplow so roads and parking can be difficult downtown.  The Depot has a parking lot across the street.  Warm up at the Coffee Depot before you start your day."}, {"review_id": "PCU6zzXtWx-pgzKtsfC1yQ", "user_id": "hebNAr83JMzUs2UKMmHm3Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "I had a pretty good Mocha while my SO had herself a Chai tea that she enjoyed. The location is kind of wonky being on the old main street of town, but worth taking a detour. My only beef is the hours. 7 p.m. is way too early to close especially for those of us that do stuff like Little Theater at the Atlas. I would have stopped by numerous times recently if they'd been open after a play finished up."}, {"review_id": "OzmAW0duu6FdRjo0lnV_Zw", "user_id": "8oaMvcV0Qt3F_Cv_hpgoYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Cute coffee shop, super friendly service, and good coffee! The owner (I'm assuming she was the owner) was friendly and visited with us about our trip, where we are from, and told us a little bit about herself, and her family.

Crystal knows her stuff right down to the perfection she applies to her vanilla bean frappe. Note: it has espresso shots and freshly ground espresso beans in it.  I'm not even a frappe girl and I'm hooked. More of a purist? Her small 1 shot latte is also absolute perfection. I cannot tell you how happy I am to have stumbled across this little gem. I feel like I finally have a go to place in Cheyenne that won't disappoint. Can't wait to try more food items as her homemade biscuits and gravy taste like they're made by angels. Edited to add: I have since tried more food and her sandwiches are delicious! Two words- homemade bread."}, {"review_id": "CTqQAWY-3r05nNiA9lXb7A", "user_id": "ZRnsUs9q6DbeJbOLjCY4ZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/26/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Ok, raised my rating here a lot because of Jennifer being such a lovely and pleasant lady attending the Barristas duty every day. Always excellent Americano and honey here. Also saw a breakfast sandwich this morning made for another customer and it looked good. A number of nice lunch sandwich things available and made in their kitchen. Jennifer was so nice about an incident. First day I came in, I forgot to pay. Dang. Got that corrected second visit."}, {"review_id": "JwYrn8DR_AGjScNyrKXjZg", "user_id": "xX2hpAdlLgRkknOQjnB5jA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/6/2017", "text": "We had a quick lunch and it was wonderful.

Friendly service. Monti crisco was grilled and not deep fried which was great and not greasy.  The turkey cheddar croissant was big and delicious.  I'm not a sandwich guy but both sandwiches looked and tasted good.  I will have to return in the morning sometime soon and try the coffee and breakfast sandwiches."}, {"review_id": "FmWDY2I8o5Mz__psne_OZA", "user_id": "WhQ2hmqRDxfu4WkamevGOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/16/2017", "text": "You know that place that you find on a road trip that you wish you could bring with you?
