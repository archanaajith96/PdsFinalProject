It was so crowded, if you have more than 4 people be prepared to wait on the weekends. We had 5 the wait was about an hour a half but we found 2 bar spots and the gentlemen with us just stood behind us and we ordered all finger foods to be safe. They also have cafe seating on the other side which is first come first serve but it was pretty full and the one table that \"open\" still was covered in food and dishes so did not want to chance it in case the occupants were just out smoking or to the restroom. The beer selection was amazing. Such a great variety and I really enjoy how detailed a one page menu can be!! They really nailed that! As for the food, we ordered the truffle fries which were amazing, definitely can't go wrong! We also ordered the nachos, I do not eat meat so I did not enjoy them but the boys loved them! They said they ran out of chips before they ran out of toppings which NEVER happens with nachos. So great to have every nacho loaded up and plenty of chicken was visible so totally a good deal. We also ordered the shrimp tacos, they were just okay. Not a lot of flavor at all. The shrimp its self had zero flavor, nor did the street corn on them, there was a pineapple salsa on them but I only tasted it in 1 bite out of three tacos, they definitely needed a kick. So new rule, stick to Barrio for tacos and Townhall for beer and atmosphere!"}, {"review_id": "eKqpRsSh8_ZliqR9_YGApg", "user_id": "w5aFZ5SxEg4Hl3cd8PlARA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I gave this place a try again on Saturday 14th 2018. I didn't receive good service the last time I was here. I sat in a different area in the bar. The bartender was very nice and attentive. Wayyyy better than the last one. Man when are they not busy??? This place was packed at 1pm. I should of known since it was a Saturday in Cleveland. I wanted to use my 25$ gift card I received from the owner for my bad experience last time. It was well worth it!I ordered the unsweetened mango ice tea. Boy was that good! I order the full monty on the brunch menu. Holy deliciousness!! A complete organic meal! Root Vegetable and larden hash, sweet potato purée, Brussel spouts, poached egg, spinach, and maple berry sorghum thick cut bacon. Geeez so tasty for being healthy! Applause! I plan to come back to try more! Prices are decent. My total check was $16.20 not including tip. With the gift card it was all free! Thank you Townhall for the gift card and making such great healthy food. It was good fuel before my yoga session! I totally recommend this place but come early because there will be a wait unless you can snag a bar seat. It's worth the wait. Great atmosphere for groups or being alone. I like to people watch and this is a good place for it!"}, {"review_id": "uIGZ1q_fgi_l1602c1Umlw", "user_id": "Fj2TxzExnThgT5nRVWwFyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "I love Townhall. I seriously need to come back because if loving TownHall this much is bad then I don't want to be right...lol.NON-ALCOHOLIC DRINKS selection - out of this world. So refreshing for a non-drinker as myself.FOOD -- Out of this world. So local. So fresh. SO tasty. The first time I came here, I met up with a friend and ordered a Salmon dish with vegetables. My friend and I split the truffle fries. I also ordered the green matcha drink. The salmon was well done and sooooo good. Those truffle fries were DA BOMB!!! The drink just topped it all off. I was so impressed with my meal. I came here again on my birthday (October 20, 2017) and ordered the vegetarian burger along with a Turmeric drink. YES, YES, YES. As a meat eater who has eaten plenty of vegetarian dishes, I definitely loved this one because it was full of flavour. Protein fix? Check. Birthday cake surprise? Check. The staff sang happy birthday to me and brought the most delicious mini cookie/ice-cream dessert. I was in heaven. And oh, I love the seating outside with the little fireplace. VIBE -- good vibes only. I remember coming here a third time in December to hang out by the bar with some friends. Although I don't drink, the vibe was cool enough where I didn't feel awkward. The whole inside is huge with TV screens by the bar and music playing which makes a party here fun.P.S. They have a brunch buffet which I haven't tried but I saw the display back in Dec. 2017 and all the toppings for pancakes and waffles looked so yummy.P.P.S. -- It gets very crowded here but the both times I came here (Fall 2017), I was outside where it was less crowded so the crowd didn't affect me. The 3rd time I was here was in Dec. 2017 because a friend from out of town was visiting and she really wanted to come here. That time around, I was inside at the bar and WOW, it gets packed inside. Try to arrive early.Check out this place for locally sourced and healthy food and drink options. You won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "elvehUQpCUaYNBANAJNIAw", "user_id": "XFpODt7ZHf_pxZxHU8XmZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "I love this bar.  I want to meet my friends here and I want to watch football games here and drink the fantastic beer offerings, fresh and dietary forward cuisine offerings.

It's basically a salty, belly warming soul renewal beverage of all that is Cleveland.  It's just one of the many treasures this place offers and it's why I will keep coming back. Brunch is becoming a thing everywhere, but Townhall has the Cleveland market cornered. Socially forward, politically local and just a great place to be.

I was here recently on a Sunday and let's just say they were packed to the gills. We were seated swiftly given the rush and the service was top notch.

I wish I remembered the names of the two gals so I could thank them again but honestly I was blown by how efficient cordial and detail oriented they were. The food has always been stellar and there are no complaints there, they always have healthy options plenty of vegetarian and vegan options so that is always a plus. Overall excellent place to eat at, great for groups and yes it will be crowded and noisy but if you were here for a quiet dinner for two then let's just say you'd prolly leave madder than a wet hen!"}, {"review_id": "JpHuKARLVdaAtrpfhpvQRA", "user_id": "SZJIHMuYCoJmSIKV8osK-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Awesome place.

We walked in and walked towards the back where there is a counter where we could order. We ordered the nachos and some garlic fries. We were given a number and got to pick out a table. We picked a table towards the front next to a water station and some board games. The water station was cool because you could pick from different types of water which is pretty much unheard of. This is the only place I have ever been to that has this feature. The games were cool too. We did not play any but did glance at the cards for the never have I ever and enjoyed laughing. Our food came out quickly and we were very happy with our choices. The garlic fires were heavenly and just the perfect amount of garlic that if I asked my husband to smell my breath he wouldn't keel over and die but you still got the flavor. The nachos were a perfect mate as the flavors of those all mixed well with the fries. They were loaded and delicious! Our food was gone in about 15 minutes and they were a great 15 minutes. The restaurant had a cool vibe and I know that if I lived in the area I would want to be a regular here. I know I could see myself enjoying all of the drinks they serve along with trying so many different items on their menu. Overall, Adam and I were very ahoy with the decision to come here and we would totally come back again.

They offer a wide variety of standard, paleo, and vegan fares so you can find something for anyone in your group. They also use organic, responsibly grown ingredients and their prices are reasonable. We have had their street tacos which had tons of flavor, Thai peanut bowl which was rich and extremely filling with fresh vegetables, and their drip coffee which is apparently tested and free of mycotoxins (I learned something here!).I definitely recommend the food but if you want a quiet, relaxed atmosphere, do not come here on the weekend.

I can finally review this place based off of food and not only their bar night life. I am pleasantly surprised about their Monday night vegan offerings. I am personally not vegan, but my friend was visiting from out of town and she is. What I did notice is that many of their Monday night vegan offerings are actually on their regular menu, so if you missed Monday you're not exactly out of luck. The vegan milkshake was superb, but I did find that it had a bit of an aftertaste I did not like. But then again, so do a lot of alternate type of foods. My friend also loooooooved the jack fruit \"pulled chicken\". Like I said, I eat meat. So of course I ordered the Korean BBQ flatbread. UHHHHHHMMM. SO. GOOD. I ate the whole thing, no regrets.

They told us there were still three groups ahead of us. Then they told us about the cafe side where you order your own food and seat yourself. I understood people where enjoying there time, so it was a longer wait, but I wish they would have told us right away about the cafe side. We didn't know that was an option and we would have went right away.I did love the fact that you give your cell phone number and they would text you when your table is ready.Once we ordered our food it came out very quickly. I got the leg day smoothie, which was absolutely amazing. It was very tasty and had a great texture. Then I also ordered the zucchini pasta. It was delicious with all the different vegetables.
