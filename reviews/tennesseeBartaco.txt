Tequila cocktails that slake your thirst? Churros that make you cry with happiness? Then this is the place for you.Our amazing, super chill waiter led us through a food journey that was absoLUTEly wondrous. We started with guacamole and cocktails, got a couple more starters/sides (the plantains and arugula-tomato-corn salad, which were both lovely), and moved onto tacos. I got the duck, rock shrimp, and pork belly. Oh dear god. The rock shrimp was good, the duck was great, and the pork belly was incredible. I saved a bite of that for last!To finish up we had the churros. Good god, these churros. And their chocolate dipping sauce. The friend I was with finished off the sauce literally just eating it with a spoon.So. Good. No other tacos or churros will ever measure up. I'm ruined for life. Thanks, Bartaco."}, {"review_id": "xoNYdW7I3NWlUw-MxrdAjA", "user_id": "OT-0VdNkBh0HOQm1apHGNw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Bartaco has been a joint I've been wanting to try since first discovering Nashville was a cool place to travel to. Love tacos, love margaritas, love outdoor seating, this place was right up my alley. Decided to come here with a group of 13 on a Saturday afternoon for a Bachelorette Party. They don't take reservations but they are affiliated with some phone app my friend had where you can put your name down on a list and they'll estimate how long the wait will be, something like that. We showed up around 4 and within 20 minutes or table was ready. The table was small, tight, we were a bit on top of one another but it was fine. Our waitress was great, friendly, outgoing, recommended items to us and let us know how many of each thing we should order yada yada. You ordered on a piece of paper and handed it to the server so we put four girls orders on one sheet to make it easy. Our server recommended we start with chips and a salsa trio consisting of guacamole, roja salsa and verde salsa. The \"chips\" came out as large circular discs and they were inedible. Honestly, it looked like an entire salt shaker was dumped on top of each disc. If you came in here with a normal blood pressure, you're leaving with hypertension. If you come in here with hypertension, you may need an ambulance. Asked our server if she could bring us some corn chips without salt and she definitely had never been asked that question before because she said she wasn't sure and then never came back to let me know if it was possible or not. Needless to say, we were all trying to rub the salt off of these chips onto the floor and still it was impossible to eat. The salsa trio was okay, the guacamole was nothing special and the salsas were really really spicy. The place was busy so our server forgot a few drinks, forgot to take a few girls' drink orders but she was nice. Their menu looked awesome, they had tons of options for vegetarians, vegans and gluten free. However after the salt fiasco with the chips, I   was worried that was going to be how all of the food was. The tacos were served with corn tortillas, you could sub our flour if you wanted or put it on a bed of lettuce. The tacos are SMALL. Probably should go for 4 or 5 if you plan on leaving satisfied. Some of their options were fried and some weren't so definitely ask if you're trying to stay away from fried food like I was. I  went with the chicken pastor and the red fish. The red fish was super super bland, which shocked me after the salty chips. The chicken was good but nothing out of this world, just okay. Additionally went with an ahi tuna rice bowl, which was a great choice. Served over brown rice with raw onions and peppers topped with your choice of meat. This was definitely a good option, seasoned well and filled me up. Two tacos and a rice bowl would be a sufficient meal in my opinion. Friends got a variety of tacos, their mushroom was a hit and they also had lots of different kinds of fish, pork, cauliflower taco, etc. Their marg was tasty. They didn't have a skinny marg option, or at least the menu didn't indicate that they did. This place is definitely a cool place to hang out; loved the interior, the bar was hoppin' people were outside just soaking up the sun, eating tacos, drinking beers loving life. They only had two bathroom stalls, which was a pain in the butt because the women's line always had at least six people deep. Was disappointed in the salty chips because it takes away from the whole fresh ingredient, healthy option. Get some chips without salt and I'll for sure be back."}, {"review_id": "KfBygsBklyLQsYS7qrgqIQ", "user_id": "WhqG_9cfE6HM9Z_ts81xBA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Oh noooooooo....I'm so sad to have to update my review and take away some stars after my most recent visit to Bartaco was beyond disappointing. I'm pretty stubborn about demanding a visit to Bartaco every time I'm in Nashville, but now I can no longer confidently recommend this restaurant. Stopped in for an early lunch on Saturday and beat the crowd (whew!) so we were immediately seated outside. Our server was quick to come over and asked if we had any questions as we looked over the drink menu. Given the patio seating and the sunshine, I was in the mood for something light and tropical. Our server recommended the seasonal caipirinha, which he described as \"sweet and fruity\". I'm not sure if he got the description wrong or the bartender made it wrong, but I took a sip and sip it out. Extremely bitter, nothing sweet about it. I had to send it back. Next came our large guac, still my favorite thing on the menu. The chips, however, were far more salty than I remember. I agree with other reviews that said the chips appeared to have salt dumped on them. I had to dust them off as best as I could for fear of my blood pressure rising. Then came the tacos that I love so much...or at least used to. My FAVORITE is the pork belly taco, so naturally I ordered 2 without hesitation and 1 fish taco, which I have also had before and liked. The pork belly has always been extremely tender and slow roasted. Either that has changed or I got the bad luck of getting in both my tacos what I would call the burnt ends. I mean they were rock hard and crunchy, not at all the texture or taste I was expecting. The fish was also not as good as I remember and too heavy on the batter. It seemed the quality has substantially decreased at Bartaco and I'll have to keep exploring to find my new go-to lunch spot in Nashville."}, {"review_id": "Gp0sQMIFkoppfJmSNSucMQ", "user_id": "mYJW4-M4tcRygSwdT3A6Ww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Nashville is a foodie lovers dream!! If you are visiting I highly suggest you stop at Bartaco. It's super trendy and nautical themed. They do not take reservations, but you can call ahead 30 minutes and put yourself on a waitlist. They also have free parking around back! We arrived on Monday around 5:30 and were seated and greeted by our server right away. She was very helpful with explaining the menu items and making recommendations. One thing I didn't like about the menus was the fact that they didn't tell you what all game with that item. For example the chicken pastor came with small chunks of pineapple, but it doesn't say that on the menu. It just says chicken pastor. I'm very detail oriented and I like knowing what all comes on my entree. When you know you want to order you mark it on a sheet and place it on the clip for the server to see and they will come right over to pick it up. Chips and salsa are not freebies here, but they do have a nice variety of salsa for you at the tables. They do not serve Pepsi products here. Which is something my mom always gets when we go out to dinner. She ended up getting sweet tea and I ordered a ginger mint tea. I knew they were going to be freshly made, since all of the alcoholic beverages were hand crafted using real fruit. I didn't expect the tea to come up in a giant carafe. The tea's were $3.50 each and for as many glasses as I poured it was well worth it. They even give you to go cups to take some home. I never had ginger mint tea before and it was extremely refreshing! I highly recommend that one. For our meals - mom ordered the cauliflower bowl and I ordered the duck taco and chicken pastor (dark meat). The cauliflower bowl comes with bell peppers, two scoops of brown rice, roasted cauliflower, onion and a special sauce (a little spicy). She loved it and it was a recommendation from our waitress. I added a side of diced pineapple with lime juice (highly recommend adding the lime juice). The duck taco came topped with white onion and was a little on the tough side. None the less it was still very flavorful. The chicken pastor was a little on the spicy side, but cooked to perfection. These tacos are tiny, so order accordingly. Overall, I was very happy with my first Bartaco experience and wish we could get one of these restaurants up in Pittsburgh!"}, {"review_id": "rf9tRByYtE61eUbvgrlZaA", "user_id": "khkh__4Zljf68UkZboR5PQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "I've wanted to try Bartaco since I first visited Nashville. It was Cinco de mayo weekend when we went so the wait was a little long but it wasn't crazy. They do let you call ahead and put your name on the list for seating & you just need to check in once you get there to let them know you've arrived. Once we got seated, the waiter explained their ordering style to us & got us started with some apps (which came out very quickly). The tacos, wow, they are tiny, but they are GOOD. You can taste how fresh they are and their menu has a wide variety of different options for the meat lover and the non-meat lover. Even their salsas and chips were extremely fresh. Lastly, their outdoor seating is wonderful, its very comfortable and super trendy.

I've never been to Captain D's, but I imagine that's how the fish tastes. The batter was greasy and no seasoning. I took one bite of that and moved on to the cauliflower taco.

That said, with at least 15 locations in 9 states, Bartaco's Nashville location succeeds by delivering delicious food and drinks, while feeling like a trendy-yet-casual, local, neighborhood hotspot.I'll start with the drinks: when it's nice out, I crave open air and a tart, citrusy cocktail. Bartaco provides both of those, with their front patio and garage doors, and their seasonal range of margarita flavors. #protip: if you like heat, ask for fresh jalapeño to be muddled into your margarita of choice. These are some of the best craft margs in town.For a place that serves designer tacos, the price point isn't confusingly pretentious like you'll find at other upscale Mexican concepts. I'm usually good with a shared app (the guac and tostadas app is on point) and 3 of their small, 4-inch tacos. Taco fillers range from more traditional (chorizo, carnitas) to more innovative, fusion items like the falafel or the sesame ribeye. And don't overlook the three house-made hot sauce bottles available on your table.The overall experience and look-and-feel are rounded out by an interactive pencil/card menu system that your server can't wait to tell you about, clean white interiors with blue and wicker accents, and blue and white gingham uniform shirts to match. The vibe is almost coastal. But with tacos.

Every time we pass by there's always a wait so we made an effort to go before the lunch rush. It was a beautiful Spring day in Nashville so we sat in the spacious patio. We had a couple of greeters, and even some help us since it was our first time. We ordered a small guacamole, tuna poke, assorted tacos, and a side of street corn off the cob. Love the whole crunchy tortilla served with the delicious chunky guac. Out of all the tacos, the pork belly was the best. I also had the cauliflower and the spicy chorizo, both were good. My husband enjoyed 3 out of his 4 lettuce tacos - pork belly, tuna tatako, baja fish. Roasted duck was his least favorite. Street corn was good, but could of used a bit more cayenne. We did not enjoy the tuna poke, which was highly anticipated. It was accidentally left off, we had to ask to for it. However, the staff was incredibly helpful in getting that out right away and even took it off the bill. It may have been the rush to get it out, but the tuna was incredibly salty, drowned in the soy sauce marinade. It was also missing a crunch element, like those crunchy tortillas. But overall, we enjoyed most of our meal, experienced wonderful service in a great atmosphere. We'll definitely be back -  I didn't even get to try dessert!

We have tried to find a worthy competitor, but they just can't them. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, this is not the place, but you should eat here anyway.We have tried a combination of about everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed. My personal favorite tacos are the chorizo and the pork belly ( the pork belly taco I truly believe is magical). For the sides, you can't go wrong with the corn (on or off the cob) and the not-Mexican-but-don't-care plantains. I'm a Miami girl, plantains are appropriate any meal regardless of what type of food it is. They are perfectly sweet and caramelized. If you've seen my reviews before, churros are always ordered, and their churros here are delicious.Their drinks are pricey, but they are top notch and they like to get creative. If you are getting a margarita, you can see them squeezing the juice fresh for you. Last time I was there I had a drink that involved watermelon, smoke and mezcal and it was amazing.If I haven't praised Bartaco enough, I will at the end here say they also have amazing service. I am allergic to cilantro, the first time I ate here someone accidentally put it all over everything and they were so apologetic and eager to imeediately make it right.
