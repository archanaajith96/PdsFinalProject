That is not really what they are, but what they do well is combine flavors to make a unique taco with unique ingredients. I've tried almost all of the tacos and can actually say I like them all even though I have my favorites. If you're wanting to stick to something safer and closer to tacos you're used to I'd say go with the Old Skool Steak Asada or the Buffalo Chicken. Also the Malasadas and Salads are definitely worth a try. My only complaint about 180 is that there isn't very much seating for how busy it gets alot. They just recently added a bunch of new sodas to their options that are pretty good. Id recommend trying the Pineapple Cream soda if you're feeling a little more adventurous."}, {"review_id": "tQRHA3UXNb2TGCpHNceRow", "user_id": "OdjsVzBPHL6S7CU2YTD1fQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "These are the best tacos in Utah County. I grew up in southern California so I know pretty good tacos! I have to preface my statement by saying they are not the most AUTHENTIC tacos, but they are creative and delicious.The menu changes with the seasons and there are always new and interesting bites to try. The quality of food is great, very fresh and always plated nicely as well. They're downright delicious. If I'm craving something a little different, I know 180 won't let me down.The only reason they do not get 5 stars from me is that they are a little on the pricey side, without being terribly filling. $7 and some change for two tacos is a bit expensive in my opinion. Still, I keep coming back, if that tells you anything! Give them a shot."}, {"review_id": "qla3EnQXKtQj_qPrernvdA", "user_id": "RzMPWgRdsa8uvPbI96XAQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "I might be remembering wrong but it seems like they used to have even more types of tacos.

Such great tasting tacos, and unique flavors that really gives this place an edge over your 'normal' taco places. That being said, let me explain more:this isn't your average taco joint. They have unique flavors that are not constrained to your normal recipes of 'tacos', however they try to be fun and throw in other things, such as asian, Polynesian, and other meat flavors. It really comes together in the form of a taco and tastes great.With that out of the way, I have only been there once. It's not an amazing place to me, but a good place. I had their Mac and Cheese, which wasn't your normal Mac & Cheese, but with Chimichurri sauce. Not my fav, but it was good. Wished it was creamier, or something.Then I had their Friday special, which was a delicious al pastor taco.ALSO THEY MAKE THEIR OWN CORN TORTILLAS WHICH IS A HUGE PLUS IN MY BOOK.Go guys, your stomach will thank you if you can handle."}, {"review_id": "k8u5oHZ36Bo6rFlj7sR75g", "user_id": "_qyc12pZ97-BuE6NI5Z9DA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "WIN. I really liked this place. Especially since we walked in and asked each other \"I don't know.. should we stay or go somewhere else?\" So glad we stayed! This place is perfect when you are looking for some flavor, like a real kick in the pants, wake you up sort of flavor. We tried the buffalo chicken, korean bbq pork, and the old school asada. I thought all the tacos were all really wonderful in different ways. I think the asada was a bit dry, so I asked for some salsa and that definitely completed it. The buffalo chicken was dripping in flavorful sauce and the korean bbq was my favorite. I really love Asian flavors and I think they were spot on with the trifecta of salty, sweet and umami. My husband couldn't get enough of the buffalo chicken. They are smart to assemble the chicken last minute, so the breading stays crispy. We also got some of the tater tots. Definitely a funky spicy flavor! We really enjoyed it though. Here is the skinny. If you love spicy flavorful things, then this is the place for you. If you like trying new flavors and having fun food combinations, then this place is for you. If you're one to not color outside the lines when it comes to food, then I would look elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "KLsZJpEuzTOgosIRwbsGVA", "user_id": "zQYQDK4OQsWRt9BU6KobJw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "I'm gonna jump on the same train as a lot of other reviewers.

The atmosphere was pretty good too. I got the 2taco plate. What I liked was that I could get 2 different flavors of tacos. So I got the old skool steak asada and the bbq pork I believe.

Great flavor, just wish it wasn't spicy. It's a really mild kick but I'm not a fan of spicy so I still would have preferred without. Would still totally get this again though because it was that good. Old Skool Steak Asada - Also really good, a lot more typical tasting mexican-style taco so not as exciting, but still yummy. Everything was really fresh tasting and they don't scrimp on guacamole, which was much appreciated. The beef was flavorful, and I liked it more than I thought I would (I'm typically a chicken fan)."}, {"review_id": "yltnaiDBHhJNzHh4Xzog9Q", "user_id": "cv1OTXjf0EzA2aq5TrC5Og", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "Very friendly staff! But the tacos and chips weren't all that. I have to say the tortillas were my favorite though. They were very thick and fluffy. I tried the falafel tacos and the falafel was very flavorful, but sort of dried out. The chips and salsa we ordered were super thick and greasy. It took a lot to take a bite out of them as it wouldn't break off like a normal tortilla chip would."}, {"review_id": "IRfUboh_O-pWiJ2AAqTr5w", "user_id": "NdNbiOdY7gqYm17R9gHKNg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "My wife loves this place.

It was cold, tasted old, was extremely under seasoned, gave me a horrible stomach ache and literally made me sick. It was EXTREMELY over priced. Good idea but it could've been so much better. I'd been waiting to try it and finally went with a friend, we both had such an awful experience, and couldn't even finish our food. Waste of money.
