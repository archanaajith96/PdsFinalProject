The French and Creole heritage of St. Louis is under appreciated; most think of New Orleans for that food and atmosphere.  If you'd never been to NO and you spent an evening at BOB then later found yourself in a The Big Easy gumbo house, you would be forgiven for thinking \"This is just like Broadway Oyster Bar.\" Or vice versa.The service hustles to serve you. The kitchen has serious chops regardless of how fast the orders are coming in. It's popular, pulsing with people on the weekends. There's a variety of fun live music booked on the year round patio space.Food: seafood flown in daily. Outstanding recipes. Execution that would make the Spanish Inquisition envious. You get what I'm saying. Get there.I finish with a photo of Lovie holding a tray of BOB bluepoints that we devoured. Lovie has delicate hands, not lumberjack hands, so marvel at the size of those shells.  I'm a Maryland boy raised on Chesapeake oysters. These were the biggest I've ever eaten.

The food is really good, and they have some interesting items on the menu (think alligator cheesecake).  The environment is really cool. Think if New Orleans and the City Museum had a love child who dropped out of culinary school after a year. They also have events and music nights, which really adds to the appeal. And please don't leave without trying the bread pudding. You're welcome. Cons: The waits can be long, I've had some iffy experiences with customer service, and I would skip the mixed drinks (they can be a little watered down IMO). I'd also avoid if you don't like/can't handle spice or seafood, but it's a Cajun restaurant, so that's probably obvious."}, {"review_id": "HItt_Mkx8UC5x_e6lIUF8A", "user_id": "im0jrhHE2uIxmfnYou1IQg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "I visited here for lunch. I wasn't the most impressed, though the server and staff were cordial.My great phone makes this meal look better than it tasted. I ordered the lobster mushroom pasta. The plate costs $21... but i could taste the freezer burn \"fake seafood\" taste of the lobster, and the pasta/sauce was bland. I love seafood, frequent a lot of businesses, and really love to cook, so it becomes easier to spot when something is a little off.I also ordered a lemonade, it never came.After observing others dishes, the crab cakes and jambalaya looked as though they might have been better choices. As I said, the staff members were cordial, and while inside you can tell it can be a great evening location to dine and relax atmosphere wise. But the food wasnt great.I will give it another try this month, and let you know how it goes."}, {"review_id": "AeqR6M1IQSRBE_vgy-hlrQ", "user_id": "3efMTDumo2gJwBQ-U_qVDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "3.5/5Stopped by BOB for a solo meal when I was visiting. Came in on a weekday for a late lunch and was a bit flustered since no one was around to greet me and I wasn't sure if I was in the right place. I ended up sitting on the outside patio and a waitress came and helped me. She was nice but seemed really busy so it was hard to get water refills or the check.I ended up ordering the Oyster Medley which included 2 of the Bienville, Rockefeller, and Cardinale and the Alligator Cheesecake.Oyster Medley: Was a bit disappointed that the oyster dish at the oyster bar was the let down of the two items. It wasn't bad but honestly each type wasn't too distinguishable and the cream just covered the fresh oyster flavor. Not bad but I wish I just had 1-2 oysters instead (3.5/5)Alligator Sausage & Shrimp Cheesecake: Was not sure what to expect but damn was this good. Definitely something I would have preferred sharing cause it was extremely heavy. It's not exactly too creamy or too salty at once but it gets to you after a while. Definitely worth a try if you can find someone to share with (otherwise it's just a bit too much after a while) (4/5)Overall I mostly enjoyed my meal here and there's a ton of other items I would love to try. If I'm ever back in town I'd definitely consider coming back."}, {"review_id": "lGg50RwrevTJlHYTHDCAlA", "user_id": "4XN3SYSQisDhnC_eVkyjvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "One of the Most AMAZING places I've ever had the pleasure of eating at.

It's not just a meal (or an oyster snack), but a true experience in STL. Located right downtown next to the stadium, I can only imagine how popular and crowded it would be in the warm months! Luckily, I was able to go during the 'off-season' when it was far less crowded but still equally as fun.Indoor space and outdoor space and also some in-between space on the patio with open windows and heaters - you have your choice depending on how you feel like eating. It's a true dive bar: decorations all over the walls, slightly uneven floors, wooden stage for local artists, oyster shells on the floor, and lots of cold beer on tap. Home run all around!I went for the lobster mac n cheese - to die for! It was so creamy, so rich, so full of chunks and so good I didn't even want to share :) And of course, the obvious must-order: oysters! Incredibly delicious and fresh and yummy. I opted to pair it with a local IPA from 4 Hands as well, because when local, I drink local.Overall, the staff were welcoming and friendly. Very helpful in giving menu recommendations, very attentive, and full of hospitality. I can't wait to frequent this spot more in the summertime because I can't think of anything better than cold oysters, crisp beer, and hot sunshine!"}, {"review_id": "BRYTStrbZWeXX3xYgP7fQA", "user_id": "TcbV7Mdc0jqxZlYtLCBTAg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "This place is fantastic. I can't believe the wife and i have waited so long to return here given its proximity to Belleville and easy location. Not to lie at night it looks a bit sketchy but we felt safe. We got seats on the patio where. Good one man band was playing. The live music totally sets the mood for a New Orleans experience!  Make sure you plan your trip when someone will be playing. We started off with raw and cooked oysters. Both were fantastic. My wife prefers cooked and I go raw. We were both pleased. For entrees we got the tacos (crawfish?) which were fantastic and I got the jambalaya also fantastic. Everyone in our party of 4 was pleased. Service was excellent as well. She was there when we needed drinks and stayed away when we didn't. I appreciate attentive servers who let you enjoy the environment and not ask 20x's how everything is!When you have an itch for some live music, tasty food and an excellent experience don't hesitate to head here."}, {"review_id": "4ZqMReFgsULU-AbA-nKaZA", "user_id": "7OqB5jRA0mQwQNgKNcKyLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "What a delicious dinner tonight! We came here as a pre-Birthday celebration. Waited less than 15 min which was impressive for 8pm on a Friday. Our server Laura was attentive, sweet, and made our experience enjoyable! We got the oyster sampler as an appetizer, the swordfish special, the shrimp voodoo tacos, and famous bread pudding as dessert. Everything was so amazing and we are overly stuffed.

I have always wanted to try it out and I'm so glad we did. They don't separate checks. The waitress will take multiple payments but you have to tell her how much to run each card for. Kind of weird. I ordered the ahi tuna salad. It was amazing! I ate the entire thing. I also got one of my cousins crab cakes. It was so delicious. My check was about $30 after tip. I also had a glass of wine.

Breaded/Fried shrimp tossed in a spicy sweet sriracha sauce.  Prince Edward Island Mussels- The mussels were not very fresh.  Would've been really good had the mussels tasted fresh. Broadway Shooters- Oysters in tomato and horseradish in a shot glass.  I expected the oysters to not be as fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised. Makes me want to try the raw oysters. Crawfish Mac and Cheese- I think this was the star of the show.  The medley of crawfish and cheese was amazing. Chicken and Andouille Gumbo- I wouldn't order this again, as I felt that the mac and cheese overshadowed it.  I really want to give this 4.5/5 stars.  I took my friends here when they visited me from California and we were all happy with this place.  Service was really good.  I could have done without the Prince Edwards Island Mussels and the Gumbo though.  They do something called preferred seating, where you call to call to reserve a time at the restaurant, and when you arrive, they will put you as #1 on the waiting list. It's nice because it eliminates the extra wait from waiting for customers who reserved to arrive."}, {"review_id": "Z03sBHJW1NqxziF0Nirk3w", "user_id": "bGFDEgpnRgJOW_qAGi3zQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "It was iight, I had a shrimp PO boy, never had one, but for a sandwich it was decent, wasn't a lot of excitement to it (like a sauce) ya know!...but it was decent and I'd love to return to try some other things on the menu.

He had a groupon so off we went. This review is for lunch although I believe they have the same menu for dinner also. It was a beautiful day so we were able to sit on the patio. We looked over the menu and made our choices. We decided to share the oysters Rockefeller. They were delicious. The cheese covering them was amazing. He went with the lobster roll with Parmesan French fries.  Not your traditional East coast lobster roll.  The roll was filled with lobster and had a mild Cajun sauce on it. He said it was delicious. His Parmesan fries were outstanding and I would get those the next time I go. I chose the crawfish enchiladas.  It came with a side of jambalaya. The enchiladas were filled with crawdads and were nice and cheesy. The jambalaya had sausage, shrimp and pork(?) mixed in. The only thing I wished for was that the rice could have been cooked a little longer. It was a little hard and chewy. Would I come back here?  Most definitely. There were so many things I wanted to try. I'll catch you on the flip side."}, {"review_id": "0ABxCFMgFYOS1Z2s7H3Wlg", "user_id": "ZxKmq86HzWmBuqFaCekPWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "On point!

Outside, rustic, graffiti laden. Like an outdoors Gino's East. Good service. Waiter kept my beers full and was very attentive. Food, less than impressive. Had the soup de jour:  Crawfish and Shrimp Chowder.   Nice base, but too many taters and spicy, NOT!  Their menu warns you about their food being very spicy. Must have a lot of pansies in this town, because there was nothing there. Biggest disappointment, and my main reason for coming, was the band. Went to see Bottoms Up Blues Gang. After a bit of Googling, I came across a great blues track they did, complete with horns, precision and keyboards. Well, apparently on Mondays, those guys have the night off. Turns out it is a gang of 2. Some guy playing acoustic guitar and some broad singing, whistling and playing a kazoo. Reminded me of Saturday morning Looney Toons. They tried to play Arlo Guthrie's Alice's Restaurant, but couldn't get by the chorus. Good thing BBs is next door. I am cautiously optimistic I can find some good music and spicy Creole on a Monday night.Oh yeah, on their menu and on the back of their work shirts it says \"Leave your attitude at home\".   I think I have a pretty good attitude, but guess I did leave it at home when I got here and had to listen to this crap. But wait, there's more!  The wind changed direction and now the putrid smells of White Castle are lofting onto the patio.   Good thing they serve they crawfish in buckets so they can be used to puke into!"}, {"review_id": "QlQVZ6JDVIXRCrTl94o6Ug", "user_id": "sb5B3nQTzDt7Qzeo2jaPrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "THE BEST SEAFOOD IN STL!
