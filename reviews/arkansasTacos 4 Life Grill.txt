While they do offer your traditional beef taco they also offer you the opportunity to take your taco taste buds on a wild ride with a plethora of flavor profiles. Looking for sweet? Shrimp Tacos. Looking for a little spice? Fish Tacos. Looking for sweet and spicy? Korean Beef Tacos. It's a pretty simple format - You can mix an match Tacos from the menu to create your own meal. I typically go with the \"pick 2 special.\" You pick 2 Tacos and get your side for a buck. I'm a fan of the rice for my side.Don't forget to try the chips and queso. If there are just 2 of you the individual size queso will be plenty for both of you."}, {"review_id": "glmGhS-bSHKZw57NoCLNSw", "user_id": "WrawTNgkfemHR1zKFoV-Uw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Absolutely delicious!

For every meal bought, they donate one meal to a hungry child. The charity they give to is \"Feed My Starving Child\". So impressed with their generosity! I just did take-out for my first time, but will definitely be back to order in. The customer service I received was great! You order at the front and they will \"buzz\" you when your food is ready. Casual dining style. The interior is fun and unique.The food that I ordered was delicious! I tried the chips and guacamole, the counselor tacos, and the fried chicken tacos. I can't wait to come back and try more! Just by looking at their menu and the items I tried, you can see that their tacos are unique. Not your typical mexican or tex-mex place. Check this place out!!"}, {"review_id": "Wv5MFLNVSCJNUkHOtU5H1Q", "user_id": "LvhgLYTcHGMCXLy3fyUnGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "Friendly staff. Explained the menu.

There are plenty of places to get tacos but when you eat a taco here they buy a meal for a hungry child. But sadly to say I found the tacos to be mediocre. The ingredients are fresh but lacks the flavor my husband and I were expecting. We both ordered the mango habanero and it was ok but I couldn't taste the habanero at all and there was very little mango. We also split the Cobb salad and that was also underwhelming. We ordered it with the cilantro lime vinegarette and the flavor just wasn't dazzling. But I am giving it a 4 star because I believe in their mission work."}, {"review_id": "C0nZj0iEwbGITq_vCSutYQ", "user_id": "JDgXG334AxrHU4btwzJ_Kw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "What a fun environment!

Tacos 4 Life came to the rescue. Started with the trio (salsa, guacamole, and queso with chips), finished with 2 tacos: mango habanero chicken and crab cake.

The inside is funky and quirky while not being obnoxious about it. Good place to meet for lunch. First time I was here the place was spotless. This time I had a little bit of trouble even finding a table cause there were trays on every one... the employees were just standing around, so I wish that it would have been a little more tidy considering. But I digress...My favorite part of course is the cause!! For every meal you buy, they donate a meal. Nothing better than a place that gives back. Yum yum yum!
