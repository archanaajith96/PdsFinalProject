And yes, I'm one of those dorks that loves designs in the cup. They get me. They also have a few bottled craft sodas around, which is a big thing for me. There's a bar also which seems to be stocked with good local brews and some adventure too.Their food menu is pretty exciting. I ordered something one day not expecting anything but mediocre coffee house offerings. I was wrong. Their sandwiches and their wraps are more than just basics slapped together. They care about their tastes.Brewhemia is a perfect compliment to New Bohemia as a neighborhood. The owners do things with the space, the menu and the service that just screams innovation mixed with a tradition of community involvement and good service."}, {"review_id": "5w4nOj3_MksF7qTu78ZQyw", "user_id": "NpEFJfIRflxQs_vPzFMrDQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Omg, I love this spot! Being from out of town, We met my cousin here for coffee & breakfast, and I had THE best (as my sister calls it) \"hipster toast\" of my life!I attempt to avoid eggs, dairy, and gluten, so breakfast can be a tough meal to eat out, if you don't want oatmeal. I was able to eat a yummy breakfast here! My avo toast consisted of:gluten free breadavocadothe BEST sautéed mushrooms, peppers, and onions I've ever eatendiced tomatoes sunflower sproutsReason for one less star? It cost me $9.00 for just one slice of toast with those fixings! Feedback to the business? Find a balance between recouping your costs + making profit vs. overcharging for alternative food options. That being said though, I will definitely go back and pay $9 for hipster toast the next time I'm in Cedar Rapids"}, {"review_id": "JesU5aOHV3BhbrYUxdxSrA", "user_id": "Z5W674ZiMpM5ZIIajzt87w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Each time I visit Brewhemia, I have enjoyed my food and my drink immensely.

You walk up to the counter, order off the chalk board menu and sit yourself at a table of your liking.  When your order is ready, the food is delivered to you.  However, if you have ordered a drip coffee, it is self-serve as are the refills, which cost $1 each.  As their name indicates, there are passionate about their coffee.  My FIL takes his coffee seriously and instantly fell in love with their tower coffee which is a slow process cold brew. I had a dirty chai (chai latte with a shot of espresso) and I thought I thought it was excellent. My husband did a cappuccino and really enjoyed it as well.For breakfast, I ordered a simple croissant sandwich with scrambled eggs and cheese.  It wasn't anything out of the box, but it was made well and the ingredients were fresh.  The star of the sandwich was obviously the croissant which was buttery, flakey and warmed to perfection.  My husband and FIL both ordered the Mother Earth Omelette (green pepper, mushroom, onion, celery and cheese).  They liked their omelettes and commented on how perfectly the veggies in the omelette were cooked.  All in all, the breakfast items we had were good.  For the ease, convenience and quickness with which you can be in and out go a long way for us, especially when our toddler is in tow.  I look forward to going back the next time I am in CR and giving them a try for lunch, which also comes highly recommended by my MIL."}, {"review_id": "jTv-YosqrND4DkSXsBHAxQ", "user_id": "tJB46F5gSq7pbv3Xkx_KoA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Perfect chai latte!

Would it fade to the background along with most other coffee shops?  Honestly, I thought the food really stood out. The menu was diverse enough to be interesting and the food was surprisingly good.  Most of the time, your neighborhood coffee house only has muffins and croissants to choose from.  Perhaps they venture to the edge risky and include some kind of pastry.  Not Brewhemia.  They offered a number of really tasty sounding breakfast dishes as well as lunch sandwiches.  I had the breakfast burrito and found it not only to be incredibly tasty but much bigger than I thought it would be.  Of course, a coffee shop is only as good as it's coffee. I am very happy to say that the coffee certainly did not disappoint either. The only reason I did not give this five stars was that it took nearly 30 minutes for our breakfast sandwiches to be brought to us."}, {"review_id": "EGOCQiWCspQ9fU5PiTou3g", "user_id": "ii_VC2a9Gxvy7cOlUpfvrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/18/2017", "text": "What a wonderful spot to grab a coffee after browsing all there is to offer in the NewBo Market! This has become kind of a tradition when I'm up in Cedar Rapids. Even if I'm several coffees in for the day, I can't turn down a chance to grab something here. I haven't had a chance to try any of their food, but all the photos on Yelp and Instagram make me feel like I need to move that up to the top of my list. I really love their chai, lattes, and vanilla lattes. The service is speedy and the baristas are kind, talented humans.

I've tried the chorizo quesadilla (excellent and spicy if you ask for it that way), the parm crusted grilled cheese (phenomenal if you're a cheese lover), and the alambre burrito (the ultimate hangover cure). I've never seen a big line, and the food has always come out quickly. Although it is often packed, so I'm not sure how well bringing a big group at peak time would go. They clearly also do a brisk lunchtime to go business.They offer a \"fast lane\" for those just looking for coffee, which I think is brilliant. The coffee is apparently quite good, although I found the hot chocolate to be a bit underwhelming (it tasted more like hot milk than hot chocolate).

Absolutely delicious. Had caramel flavored latte. Friend ordered biscuits and gravy. She said it's the BEST b&g she's EVER had. A little sweet and a little kick. Also ordered the eggnog latte.

The location:  they moved  down the street to a larger, more beautiful location.  The menu has expanded drastically offering hot breakfast (the breakfast sandwich is AMAZING , I prefer mine on a croissant....or for a healthy and delicious option, try one of the beast bowls).  There are also lunch options.  The kitchen closes at 2 so you are out of luck for dinner.  They also have beer on tap and cocktails. Again,  many changed, yes...but one thing remains the same.  The coffee is still, hands down, the best I've had in the state of Iowa.I've had only positive encounters with the owner...  I think she remembers me from our Aug '16 encounter, but neither of us have  brought it up.  She treats me with respect and appreciation...just as I've seen her do with all of her other guests.  We'll just chalk that day up to the stresses of relocating a business and move forward."}, {"review_id": "lzXw4FsWNjWCGRgwtSgqxQ", "user_id": "9ojE-trVdE3qySbW8a_pBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2016", "text": "Oh my heck!
