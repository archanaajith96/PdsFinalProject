That struggle ended when I was introduced to Biga Pizza. It is about as good as the pizza from New Jersey and New York. The menu offers quite a few specialty pizzas as well as other items but my husband and I have only had the pizza and a couple of exceptional salads. We go here for the pizza.The crust is just the right mix of thin and chewy. He gets different toppings and I generally get cheese although one time I tried the fig and prosciutto and it was to die for. I just have a thing for good, cheese pizza. And that definitely can be found here.There are different sizes and they will let you order a half and half which is great for a couple. It makes for an affordable night out. We have found that a 12\" pizza is perfect for us with a couple of pieces leftover for lunch the next day.The salad we had the other night was a mixed greens with a slice of warm brie topped by a cranberry compote and almonds with a honey wine vinaigrette. I would eat that salad every night it was so good.Service is always friendly albeit at times slow when the place is crowded but when the food is this good you can handle a touch of slow service. The efficiency and smiles make up for it. Water glasses are always kept filled."}, {"review_id": "2b0gLmbvhscJlybGiOdxkA", "user_id": "t915J2Cz0sMYQk-nEwA0Ng", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "A pizza place for locals, which this non local was not impressed with.  We called around 6:00 pm on a Friday night and the guy on the phone said they were not busy and we did not need a reservation. Upon arrival, the place was packed with a few tables open for reservations. When we told the hostess that we called and were told that reservations were not needed, she looked at us shrugged and said 'people come through the door, what can I say, it's a 25 minute wait.' Her attitude was beyond belief and a negative taste had already been put in my mouth prior to even sitting down.  (We would have had no problem waiting if she would have responded differently but the attitude - unbelievable) About 15 minutes later, my dad asked if we were next and again with an attitude she says 'yeah you're next' turned away and rolled her eyes. Seriously?! How can you have an attitude like that?  You're the hostess for a local pizza joint not Le Bernardin, completely uncalled for and extremely bad brand representation. The pizza was decent. The ingredients were fresh, the dough although thick had a nice fold and it was not greasy. Coming from NY we're serious about our pizza - overall we were satisfied.  The Caprese salad was a bit different but good, we were surprised with how fresh the tomatoes were. The waitresses were also quite nice and attentive. Oddly enough, the guy who we spoke to on the phone brought us one of our pizzas. He actually apologized for telling us that we did not need a reservation and had to wait which was very nice and proved customer service and appreciation does exist at Biga. I wonder how he found out that we were the ones that called and ended up waiting.....It's all about first impressions - attitude can make or break you especially in the restaurant business. Regardless if you're a local or just visiting, customer service and appreciation should be given to every patron and should start the moment the customer walks through the door. Due to the hostesses behavior, it was an unfortunate experience. I can understand why this is a local spot however, if you're from out of town and visiting, I would not recommend Biga."}, {"review_id": "BYtGHVN-0Dzt1IJCAPfhpw", "user_id": "N-uM-ng9ItCwy55GJZoj_g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This is a must stop in Missoula.

Biga Pizza has a smallish space and, considering what terrific food they serve at such attractive prices, it's often very crowded. They do a great job making room for guests as seats become available and they do an even better job making tasty thin crust pizza and making you feel welcome once seated.

I mistakenly ordered a white pie, which are not usually my favorite. But the Pompeii, with ricotta, spinach, red peppers, and garlic, was fantastic. The crust was a little unevenly cooked, but the more well done side had a great char and lots of crust bubbles.The real strength of this pie was the quality of the toppings. The base was a layer of creamy ricotta - perhaps the best ricotta I've ever had. Clumps of spinach were a little crispy from the oven. And the hints of garlic were at just the right level, rather than being overpowering."}, {"review_id": "oEYuNR_BrfF_7oy1sVCw3A", "user_id": "4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "I stopped by here a couple of nights ago with my wife and her parents for dinner.  We had been recommended Bigas by the property manager of our Airbnb.  We arrived to the restaurant at shortly before 6 PM and were quoted about an hour wait.  We agreed to stay and the wait ended up being around 45 minutes.  The inside of Bigas has a bar with a giant wood pizza oven behind it and is rather small with seating for around 50 if you include the bar.  The walls are decorated with some crazy art as well as the numerous pizza awards that they have won.For dinner our table decided to split a large pesto pizza and then went with a large that was half fennel marmalade, bacon & Gouda and half Sicilian. After probably around a 45 minute wait our pizzas were brought out to the table.    The first one that I tried was the fennel, bacon and Gouda which was quite good.  Due to the fennel being a marmalade it didn't taste like black licorice at all and instead had a sweet flavor to it which paired nicely with the salty bacon and cheese.  The crust on this pizza was also very good as it was crispy and had a good bite to it.  As a matter of a fact all of the pizza that we had here had the same delicious crust which was nice.  Our Sicilian pizza was also good but the best of the bunch was the pesto one.  The pesto for a sauce was amazing and gave a great basil flavor to every bite.The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I really enjoyed all of the pizzas that we tried here and boy is their crust good."}, {"review_id": "xOkwhWtGKhCOQykmqiy5_w", "user_id": "U1QyHoZ1cO5TqSOvX7le5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Hands down The best Pizza in Montana, no doubt about it.

It's a nice little place , has maybe 60 seats and alcohol. The prices aren't bad, the servers on the surface are pleasant enough.I tried a local favorite, the Quattro Formaggio.  Fresh mozzarella, gorgonzola,raggiano,garlic,olive oil. I don't know why this is popular.  It was a limp pizza dripping with grease and oil, and short on flavor. The crust edges were cooked, noy crisp and the rest of the crust was not cooked through. As I was at the counter and could see the oven I timed how long they cooked pizzas.  Not nearly long enough. A 16 inch loaded pie was cooked 5 minutes. 4-5 minutes seemed to be the norm.The pizza is 12 or 16 inch. I ate the 12 inch and was still hungry. No toppings and thin crust isn't filling.Everyone there seems happy enough but I wouldn't go back, not for pizza anyway. My server was disinterested, checked on me once, and I found the piercings and hoops in her lower lip distracting and unappetizing so it's just as well. (Not an indication of her as a person nor am I questioning her choices. I found the piercings unsettling others may not. )The pizza makers are behind the counter but wanted nothing to do with customers. Wasted opportunity to create an experince. If they can chit chat with each other and the servers they can do it with customers that are 1 foot from them."}, {"review_id": "v4V7m2QtOWlJEA9hwScJgw", "user_id": "vf1c4eqpNGweHQqJcjShFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2017", "text": "We went in search of the best rated pizza place in Missoula for our short visit to Montana.
