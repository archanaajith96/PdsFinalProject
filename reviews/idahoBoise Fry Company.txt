I recommend the classic, with the po-balls. But I've yet to try one of the French Fry options that isn't awesome. My only frustration with this place? It takes people such a freakin long time to place their order. Newbs are especially irritating. Too many choices for most people to handle, so they just freeze. May I make a suggestion? Stand back at out of the way, watch a few of us pros place our order while you make your extensive analysis of the menu board. It's really not that tough, and you're aggravating those of us who know what we want and are drooling all over your back!"}, {"review_id": "i-ANtyV62r-ovQPZWKxf9A", "user_id": "ECrbUFtTBAsxpuhL5JMSZg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I've never laughed so hard at a burger in my life. My wife unwraps her burger and I can't stop laughing... I can't even look at it because it's too hilarious. She glares at me while she pokes at it. I think whoever took our order mistook \"I want a hamburger\" for \"please find a huge tub of mayonnaise and empty it all over some brown paper. Then wrap it... Oh ya, and could you throw some other burger looking ingredients on there just so it kinda looks like a burger?\"  I took a picture and it still cracks me up every time I look at. HahahahaWhen my friends ask what we should eat I say, \"I know just the place!\" Hahaha \"How about a burger?\" Then I show them the picture of this masterpiece of mayonnaise. Sells em' every time . Thanks for the mems Idaho Fry Company. 10/10 will come back again... for the fries... or a weeks' supply of mayo.

I've been in Idaho about four years. Before I moved here, I had a somewhat ethereal, intangible thought rolling-around in my otherwise empty head, \"Well, at least the french fries will be good.\" Wrong!I don't get it. Here we are in the potato capital of planet Earth, and good french fries are hard to find. This is becoming a huge mystery to me, right up there with, \"Is there intelligent life in the Universe, including Earth?\"So, when I saw the \"byline\" for Boise Fry Company, \"Burgers on the Side\", I thought to myself, \"Eureka! At last!\" Wrong, again!There are little menus available near the cash register, which are entitled, \"How to BFC.\" In other words, an instruction manual, which narrates how to go about ordering at BFC. Okay, fine.Fries being primary, and the burgers secondary, STEP 1 is to order the fries from a large assortment of choices in small or large portions: russet, gold, laura, yam, sweet, Okinawa, or brussels sprouts. Then the cut: regular, homestyle, curley, chips, shoestring, or po'ball. Then, as STEP 2, you order your burger: beef, bison, turkey, or vegan.Then, your topping: garlic aioli, spring mix, red onion gastrique [SIC], tomato, special sauce, or lettuce ... then, an \"add on\": cheese, bacon, babanero, an extra patty, and/or a gluten free bun.STEP 3 is to order a drink, which can be a craft beer, a local wine, or \"house made\" sodas. I don't drink alcohol, so, I cannot comment on the \"craft beers,\" which have become a big thing these days.And, finally, STEP 4, dessert, which can be a rootbeer float or a donut. A donut? Why would anybody, anybody --- except the most obese who waddle amongst us --- want to eat a donut after fries and a burger? The only reason is to be certain that we consume all the basic food groups at one sitting: Triglycerides/fatty acids, carbohydrates, and sugars. Customers get to choose their own style of sodium and sauces after the fries and burger are served. These delicacies are available at a dispensary, which rivals the control room of spaceship Enterprise, \"I'm givin' her everything she's got, Captain!\" So, I ordered a beef burger, with lettuce & tomato, a fountain drink, and small portion of russet fries, cut \"homestyle,\" which is supposedly a thicker cut than \"regular\". This came to $11.79, including tax.Kindly refer to the image, attached here. Looking at this image, you may be able to understand why, when it was served, I had high hopes. The fries, in particular, looked as though they were gonna be delicious, what with that nice, deep-fried color and all. I was hungry, and my mouth was watering. What a disappointment! (PS: The little holes in the serving platter are there to accommodate the little paper cups for the dipping sauces, and such; kinda clever.)As appealing to the eye as those fries might have been to the naked eye, the taste was left somewhere, but where? It's kinda like having just seen a film, a film which \"just misses\". You know: You watch the film, and can't help but wonder if some of the best scenes were left on the cutting/editing room floor.The fries were soggy, mealy, all-but tasteless, and no amount of their special salts would relocate and resurrect the long-lost flavors. I ate most of them (but tossed some of 'em), because I was hungry, but I cannot say that I enjoyed them. Bummer!Boise Fry Company states that their supply of potatoes and other ingredients is seasonal. So, maybe I just got a bad potato, I dunno.The beef burger was okay, not great, just okay, but I am not complaining about the burger. It was well within the confines of \"acceptable\" ... with only lettuce and tomato, it was a back-to-the-basics-burger, which is what I wanted. And, oh, I ordered it cooked \"medium\" and it was cooked just right. Albeit with low expectations, this is all to say they got the burger right.Oh, the fountain drink, lemonade, was okay too, nothing special ... just your common, ordinary machine-dispensed drink. I, somehow, managed to miss-out on their advertised, \"house-made sodas\".Most Yelp reviewers seem to think that the Bison burger, that's buffalo, if you don't know, is the way to go. So, I may try that the next time and, yes, I will give the place another try. The place MAY have potential but, from my point-of-view, I am still searching for the best fries in the greater Boise area, at least for now."}, {"review_id": "nWTOT_utz8wLKx_DRkHYjQ", "user_id": "fdHRuoVQJ-7hhGowOFpX_w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Tater tasters paradise.

Beef Burger Meal ($9.40): Toppings of the burger will depend on what you choose - I went with The Original which was spring mix, red onion, tomato, and garlic aioli. It was a good burger but nothing great - the buns were subpar. Added bacon to the burger (+0.75) which made the entire burger just that much better. The combo includes a drink and small fry or house salad.For my fries, I ordered four smalls - russet, purple, gold, and laura. I had the cashier choose the cuts of the fries for what he recommended.
