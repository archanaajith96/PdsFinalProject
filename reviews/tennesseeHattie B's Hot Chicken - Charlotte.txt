It took us about an hour to get there, but we made it. I've seen it on Triple D so since then, I've always wanted to make my way here. We went on a Sunday because it's the only day they serve waffles. We got there 30 minutes after opening and the line was already out of the door. We waited in line for about 30 minutes so it wasn't that bad. Food came out shortly after and everything we ordered was delish! I strongly suggest ordering some peach cobbler. It was the perfect way to end our meal!I'd give this restaurant a 5, but there was a slight error. I had ordered 1 large dark meat plate and 1 large dark chicken and waffles plate. We received our order and noticed we were given white meat. I then checked my receipt and they rang me up for white plates instead of dark  I know I should have checked the receipt after ordering but it slipped my mind.

There is an extremely busy Hattie Bs in midtown, but this location only had a small line. They moved quickly and efficiently, which we appreciated. They also had a ton of seating and cute themed decor. My friend and I decided to split a 3 piece chicken tender meal, since that's what we had at Prince's. We had the pimento mac and cheese and the Southern Greens on the side. We went with the mild after our experience at Prince's, though I will say it was nice that Hattie B's had a heat chart on their menu. We should have gone with the medium because the mild was a true mild, not much heat at all. I think Prince's chicken and pickles were better, but Hattie's had the best sides! The greens and mac and cheese were both super delicious. I also loved the banana pudding, though it was a bit sweet, it had everything I love - pieces of bananas, nilla wafers, and whipped cream. While I think the chicken and pickles are better at Prince's, Hattie's would be my preference for overall experience. The service, speed, sides, and dessert took the experience over the top for me."}, {"review_id": "32mniJlfzsM2cZikgnmnSw", "user_id": "RV4SO0oL5ZOtLVnipyL5GQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "We came to this one because it's normally less crowded than the other location.

With a visitor in town, it was a no-brainer to take them here over the holiday weekend. We arrived at this location a little after six on Monday night, and there was only una persona in front of us in line. I like this location so much better than the midtown one because regardless of the time, you know the wait is going to be shorter than whatever is going on over there at that tourist trap. Without the busy rush, the staff were super friendly and were able to chit-chat with us while ordering! He helped us decide which spice levels to get, which beer to order based on our preferences, and even informed us about spirit animal parties which I now know I need to get to one ASAP. I decided on a sandwich, and originally ordered medium. After he told the boyfriend HOT was tolerable with the sandwich components, I was sold and changed my order. One HOT chicken sandwich, with a Jackalope and pimento mac and cheese. The boyfriend had the same, but crinkle cut fries instead. The sandwich was everything I dreamt of and more. The chicken was yet again perfectly crispy on the outside, without being greasy, and juicy on the inside. The bread, creaminess of the coleslaw, and acidity from the pickles helped to balance out the spice level of the hot (oh, and all the ranch I dunked my Sammy into!) I love how the ingredients come together to form perfect bites for all of my taste buddies. The mac and cheese was good, but underwhelming compared to the magnificent sandwich. Shockingly, the fries were crispy  and well-seasoned. I always doubt crinkle cuts, because they remind me of limp school lunch French fries, and I never expect them to be anything more than that. Hattie B's proved me wrong. How was the hot? It was definitely hot, but on the sandwich it was tolerable. I'm not sure I could handle it on its own, I still felt it in my ears after we left. But I sure do love this place and cannot wait for my next meal there."}, {"review_id": "F2DGljbVcXJqIjQuu1AS-w", "user_id": "wod4nYLpZR60Ap5k0D2_iQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Yes.  I stood in line for about 40 minutes for fried chicken.  My friends and I went to the Charlotte location around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon.  I figured the Midtown location would have a longer line and also fewer places to sit.Standing in line was not terrible.  It was a mild Spring day--no rain, no super hot sun, light breeze.  Someone from the restaurant came out and took beer orders while we stood outside.  I'm not sure if their liquor license allows for that, but oh well.  It was a nice touch.You stand in line just to place your order.  They give you a number, you pick out an open table and then wait about 15 minutes for your food to come out.  It is torture just sitting there hungry and watching all of this awesome looking food go by every few minutes.  Then you start to doubt your order and hope that what you ordered is as good as what just came out of the kitchen but landed on someone else's table.The staff was on top of things.  The tables turned over pretty quickly.  Most people seemed to get up and leave behind a mess and a Hattie B' employee was on top of wiping down the tables so that people had a place to sit.  There was plenty of seats inside and outside seating too for the overflow crowd.We had plenty of time to ponder the menu while standing in line.  All four of us went with the Small White--a chicken breast and wing with two sides.  I got the black eyed peas salad and the collard greens.  Both were really good.  The salad had a nice acidic tang to it and they peas were cooked perfectly.  Not too hard and not mushy.  The collard greens were delicious as well.  I should have ordered an extra side of the greens.  Others at the table got french fries, coleslaw, baked beans and the banana pudding.  The only negative I heard was that the coleslaw was not creamy enough.  The chicken.  There was a lot of discussion about how hot to go.  Two of my friends went mild.  My fiance went with medium.  I went with hot.  Anyone who knows me knows that I like spicy food.  I wish I had gone with the Damn Hot chicken.  The hot had a nice little slow heat but to me, that's about it.  I didn't sweat.  I didn't tear up.  I didn't need massive amount of liquid to cool down.  No heartburn after lunch either.   As for the chicken breast, the breading was light and crispy even with all of that sauce on it.  The chicken was moist and delicious.  It was worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "NGi7kHoF-erE5M8FmEL6-A", "user_id": "-boyAT-5i6HyD7IZxDOccQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Guys, I consider myself a foodie and have been leaving reviews with TripAdvisor, but lately I have been using Yelp to check out places, so I figured I join the Yelp crowd! - I always try to be as honest as possible.

(not everyone is a food lover ya know).I whipped out my yelp app and found a number of hot chicken joints but Hattie had glowing reviews and pics had me drooling.

I do want to say the spiciness level is definitely toned down compared to the more mom and pop places. I ordered medium as my friend had told me the hot was too spicy for him. This was my first time trying it, so I didn't want to be so ambitious. Either I can handle a lot spicier than I thought, or Hattie B's turned down the spiciness level.I did try Bolton's a 2 days later and found the chicken there to be more tender and a way lot spicier (ordered mild).

Believe all those Travel Channel specials and Food Network shows that have featured Hattie B's! This place is for real! If you have not yet had the most pleasurable experience of chowing down on some actual Tennessee spicy fried chicken then you may need to make your airline reservations this instant so that you can go to Nashville and eat this amazing regional type of fried chicken! Having visited Nashville for the first time earlier this fall, I knew that I had to find a place that serves some of this city's best-known food item. I was directed by several locals to two different spicy fried chicken joints. I was told that one must go to either Prince's or Hattie B's. As Prince's was closed the day I was there Hattie B's was the obvious choice. Hattie B's currently has two locations: 1) the original location which is smack dab in the middle of the main drag (where all the country western bars are) and 2) the second & newer location, which was the one that I ate. The newer location is just a short Über ride away from downtown and from what I was told it is much larger, has a cleaner ambiance, shorter lines, and quicker more efficient service. We ate here on a Saturday before a Kansas State v. Vanderbilt football game; therefore, the line was literally out the door and into the parking lot and almost down to the sidewalk! Ya, we had to wait about 30/40 minutes before we made it to the counter to order but it was well worth the wait and I would do the wait again if it meant I got to put some of that Nashville fried chicken in my belly!There are roughly 5 different levels of heat/spice at which you can order your fried chicken. My lunch mate and I both ordered the medium level but we sat next to a couple of guys that ordered their chicken at the \"shut the cluck up\" (the hottest) spice level. These gentlemen were literally in tears with runny noses and full-fledged hiccups as they ate their volcanic chicken. I, on the other hand, only had a mild case of the heat tears as I devoured the pleasurable yet painful three piece chicken finger dinner. The crust on Hattie B's chicken is super crispy and from my knowledge of fried chicken cookery, (once upon a time I worked at one of Kansas City's most loved chicken restaurants, Stroud's) I believe that they must marinate the chicken in some type of buttermilk wet-mix for at least 24 hours, then they coat the chicken and deep fry it, & then when finished in the frier the chicken is tossed with the customer's preferred level of heat and sauce that will then heavily coat the crispy chicken.It must also be known that it's not just the chicken that gets five stars here but the sides (the several that I tried) are all fantastic! The standout sides were: the collard greens which were laced with bacon chunks and stewed for many hours, the mac & cheese which was just really good classic macaroni and cheese, and the fried pickles/okra served with a yummy version of their house-made ranch dressing! Lastly, do not forget to order a large sweet tea as it goes perfectly with the spice of the fried chicken!Honestly, I think this is the best fried chicken that I have ever had the pleasure (and pain) of eating! You can tell that this is a well-run business, from the chefs to the counter staff and bus-persons to the management. This is apparent by the cleanliness (but not sterile) ambiance of the store, the speed at which they are able to get people in, fed, and out of a ridiculously long line, & the superb level of quality at which the food is still served. This is a true story: as soon as I was done eating at Hattie B's I started to plan (in my head) my next trip to Nashville to return for my fill of some Hattie B's & maybe next time I'll get to compare it to some of the other well-known Nashville chicken shacks like Prince's and Pepperfire. Don't worry though Hattie B's, you were my first and I will always be ecstatic to walk through your doors and eat your chicken any day of the week!"}, {"review_id": "NPM71ni5HVIe-d93Pvojrw", "user_id": "FsLHspoG9dOTarpajn9ubg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Literally our 1st stop in Nashville.

I'm personally not a big pimiento cheese fan but this worked perfectly! Even our lil man loved it. We may have to go back before our brief trip is over.

With the Sunday lunch crowd, the wait was about 50 minutes. At least for more than half that time I was in a covered area. I got the 2 piece dark chicken combo. Very important decision is what spiciness level. I chose medium chicken (level 3 of 5). The range is from Non spicy to Shut the Cluck Up. My choice of 2 sides were cole slaw and baked beans with bacon bits. The slaw needed dash of salt and had some big thick pieces. The beans were delicious. You order at the counter, get a numbered table sign and eagerly wait for your food to arrive. I wouldn't eat the bread that soaks up chicken. Looked oily and soggy. Medium was right amount of spicy. The chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly. The fries were great, spicy but kinda salty. Ours were also served at room temp. They easily gave us a fresh new batch. Hattie's has sweet tea naturally and brewed tea. Unlimited refills. Great friendly, customer service. Clean place, with a few t.v.'s showing sports. Big parking lot, too. Be aware there is a SEPARATE LINE for TO GO orders!! I felt bad that the guy in front of me only realized it after waiting so long. :(And make sure you try the banana pudding!!

Prince's is more of a fresh chicken and dry rub type of flavor. Rocky's is just....not Nashville lol. I hear so many black people prefer Prince's over Hattie but I guess I'm not in that number lol.
