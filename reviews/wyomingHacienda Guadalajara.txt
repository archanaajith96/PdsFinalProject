If you're craving Mexican, Chipotle or Qdoba would be a better way to go. I ordered a mole` chicken burrito. The tortilla was store bought, chicken was dry, mole` was watery. The restaurant is cute though. Plenty of seating and nice colors.So, if you were looking for a restaurant that could feed lots of people who can't taste anything anyway, this place would do."}, {"review_id": "GHFSgj4Q0qKuEHo5xpo78Q", "user_id": "5o_DqiEfbkRVN_btwDH33g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "This Mexican restaurant was amazing all the food was delicious. I had the enchiladas with the cheese sauce on top and it was the best enchiladas I ever had. I went to this place both times I was in Wyoming and had to bring the family with me. My family and I are big fans of Mexican food we all left happy and full. Also their margaritas were delicious. We all had desert also my favorite was the fried ice cream. The family also had the cheese cake and flan. Great atmosphere not to loud you can have conversation with who you are with. The staff was very friendly."}, {"review_id": "hiM_V0cHBoh4gTP7AwZUPQ", "user_id": "s_BmfMGtt8cwN__VP4L_UA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/11/2017", "text": "Stoped in for a quick bite. Ordered a fajita burrito before dinner chips and salsa comes with beans as well. Burrito arrived very quick on lava hot plate. Bathroom was presentable. The goodPrice for the amount of food that arrived on my plate. The salsa The bean dipThe chips Order arrived at table correctly including all requests The tortilla was fresh with all the correct stuff in it.The not so greatServer was nowhere to be found to ask for more chips or fill up water glasses. Never checked back in to see how everything was. My plate had a tun of cheese on it. I like cheese but this was 1/2 and inch thick in a few places this made the whole plate swimming in grease. (Not appetizing at all)Inside the burrito was an entire stick of butter. It was so rich that with every bite I could feel my arteries clogging. (I'm known to finish an entire meal in mear minuets) it was dripping off every fork full. I could only eat the meat out of it.I would return. But I would be sure to order no cheese (or on the side) and no beans my plate was swimming."}, {"review_id": "IsbG7ztj5d8CXUlmvoIySQ", "user_id": "0_5Qvupoc9HvfRQt-xIp8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Always one of my favorites when in Cheyenne!  Food is fresh and well prepared.  Friendly service and great atmosphere!  Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "_AKXwZbfoR_2bRmBTGsEDg", "user_id": "s18TpnHsLkV3-7bj0c1icQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/6/2017", "text": "Ordered the fish, reasonably priced large serving.

They were packed. The service was fast enough, considering their loading. Chops were great, salsas good. The cheese quest was good, the red salsa a bit sharp and watery, but ok. The sopa de albondigas was excellent, the quesadillos great. Their tortillas were most excellent,  as well.  Definitely recommended.

Nothing that you couldn't make at home. The only thing that would impress me is if they had fried flour tortilla chips instead of bland corn chips. Depending on what you get, most of the meals look like a blob of beans and cheese to be honest. It kind of reminded me of Casa Bonita with a dash of Taco Bell."}, {"review_id": "ArKhwgoxy91mqW_mQC_zRw", "user_id": "peruOcRlT6ahDi0XCP3jSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/19/2017", "text": "Fantastic food...curt but quick service.

The rest of my family loves Mexican, so they know food Mexican, from Cheyenne to Florida!*****The parking lot is misleading, but so is any picture of real Mexican food. It takes a lot of Photoshop to make any Mexican dish  look good. But this place is as good as photoshopped Mexican food.The chips are fantastic and they give you more then just salsa which is great for someone like me who can't stand spicy.(why am I at a Mexican place? Cause this place is amazing).Walking in its kind of overwhelming. In a very great colorful and beautiful way. It's tacky and cute and no chair looks alike. Even the ceiling is interesting.Tables were clean.Booth was comfortable, (not pushing you forward like most booths).They also serve dinner all day long! This place can fill any hungry guy.Waiter was quiet, but when I asked a few questions about spicy and his favorites he was very out spoken and content to help.Food is decently priced for a good Mexican place.My mother ordered a platter that was big enough for three people and it was $13. Not only was it huge if was amazing. (If you don't like spinach, get over it for this dish,  it's worth it).Now, last, but not least. How do you pronounce the name to this place?!?"}, {"review_id": "_LfWiSwnuy7NR5U81GhL3w", "user_id": "BpptcjOwMYfaR3mRq8pdtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/13/2016", "text": "I eat a lot of Mexican food, and I can honestly say this is some of the best I've ever had.
