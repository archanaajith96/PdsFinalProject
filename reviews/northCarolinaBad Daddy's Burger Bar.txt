We were seated quickly and I was so excited when  I saw the food other people ordered. Basically, this place went beyond expectations and blew my taste buds out of the water. I got the badass burger (medium rare) with sweet potato fries and everything was AMAZINGGG!! The medium rare was done perfectly and I've had a good amount of burgers that it's actually pretty rare to get this done just right but this place did it. The sweet potato fries complimented the savory flavor of the burger so well that my taste buds kept rejoicing with every bite. It was also huge that I had trouble holding it after 2 bites but that speaks to just how great the portion size is so might consider sharing if you're a small eater.My friends got the mushroom burger and I believe the bacon cheeseburger on steroid. Both commented this was probably the best burger they've had so far and we got the truffle Parmesan fries and tater tots. The tots were just okay but the parmesan fries hit the spot and we all raved about it. Price wise, this place is a great deal if you get the combo with the burger so absolutely recommend this place if you want quality burgers at a great price and incredibly friendly staff.  GO HERE AND ENJOY!!! :D"}, {"review_id": "duEqEMSKbo_300gIUDMcDA", "user_id": "4CRqqtRltEsW3kWSfSf9rQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "This place is unabashedly a burger joint. It has burgers, shakes, fried sides, sports on the televisions... all the usual trappings. Fortunately, it's a very GOOD burger joint! That brings two of it's biggest downsides: They are popular enough to be very busy (despite having outdoor seating to provide more tables) and it's INCREDIBLY noisy inside during their peak hours.Still, the pro definitely outweigh the cons! The burgers are well-cooked (and the cooks do understand the difference between medium rare and medium) and there's a veggie burger that goes over well with my vegetarian wife. In addition to that, there's also buffalo burgers and NC local, grass-fed beef, turkey, chicken, tuna etc. Really, there are nearly an infinite number of combinations on the 'make your own' menu. I like bacon (their jalapeno bacon is delightful!), chipotle mayo, onion straws on a lettuce bun.We usually get the fried pickles for an appetizer though their onion rings are a worthy option either as a starter or on the side. The truffle aioli topped french fries sounded better than they were but they weren't terrible, just not to our taste.They have LOTS of beers, including locally brewed ones. As the designated driver, I have water and one of the tasty gourmet milkshakes... typically the Chunky Elvis. But, like the burgers, the shakes can be made to order. (Also the salads, but who goes to a burger place for salad?)While not a good 'date' place and it's almost impossible to hear yourself think (unless you outside), we go here on a regular basis. Oh, if you have a dog, the outside patio is dog friendly!"}, {"review_id": "GUCY9xzCmTWbEICPJzzPvw", "user_id": "MmQv7nXo3EKVW6ZbFBZ08A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "I'v always been a fan of Bad Daddy's and this location does not disappoint! We went in on a Saturday and idk if they they are slammed every Saturday for lunch or because the NCAA tournament was on, but it was a mad house. It was a bit too cold to have the patio open, but to help with the wait they were serving people out there who were interested. We only ended up waiting around 20 minutes, but the wait estimate did get to over an hour for some people. Parking was a bit tricky, but as long as you don't mind walking a bit you can always find something in the Seaboard Station lot.My husband and I usually always get the Sam I Am burger. We really have a hard time branching out and trying anything else. We just love it! The burger and egg were cooked exactly to our liking. The tater tots are always a solid side and they come with a smokey bbq sauce, the house made chips with ranch are also a good option. Although our server was slammed she was always there when we needed her and on top of everything. We will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "lDoa8MeQ4hY5K1TI4cY2VA", "user_id": "onTXGMvAjRA-17YwX-9I7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "After my last review, a manager reached out to me about my experience. He ended up sending us some coupons for free burgers and asked that we give it another try. Our server was great and came to check on us often, even though it was a pretty busy Friday night. I tried the Oreo shake this time and it was sinfully good. I ordered the magic mushroom burger which was absolutely delicious. If you like mushrooms, I highly recommend it! My husband got western burger, which he says was the best buffalo burger he's ever had. The tater tots were pretty salty, so I think that the fried things we had last time (the fried pickles and the fried onions on the burgers) collectively led to everything being too salty for me.  Overall, it was a great dinner. We'll definitely be coming back for more burgers in the future!"}, {"review_id": "vgNu48mqXL_10nimzJliJw", "user_id": "MRpBPTpc68hIsh0jWSSG9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "We came in at 9pm and we were sat down immediately.I really liked the atmosphere.

The dollar value is good. When the place is packed it can be a little load as everyone is trying to talk over music and each other.There is one problem with the Raleigh location.

Enough food that we brought leftovers home.  Skipped dessert although the shakes sounded good.  Both locations have good food and service but I'll go with north raleigh location as Seaboard was really loud and very crowded."}, {"review_id": "1QTFlOzsvYUjXI5M2Hv2tA", "user_id": "T0rKLwua6zQR3m-d09yoPA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/3/2017", "text": "Bad Daddy's is a great place to go with family or friends on football Sunday.

He ultimately apologized, mailed me a coupon for a free burger/fry, and asked me to come back and try again - and recommended trying a more standard burger. I regret it took me longer than I intended to get back, but my second experience was markedly different (and had no warning that I had any previous experience). Server was on point and checked on us regularly. This time my burger and tots came with a dipping sauce that was delicious and which I didn't realize I didn't get the last time I was in. For my burger, I took the recommendation and opted for the bacon cheeseburger on steroids at the top of the list, which boasted thick and flavorful jalapeno bacon AND applewood smoked bacon, as well as Monterey Jack cheese and a bacon mayo. This was probably, hands down, one of the best burgers I've eaten in my life. It was cooked perfectly at the requested medium, was perfectly seasoned, juicier than you could imagine, and everything was perfectly in sync with the bacon theme. While this meal didn't cost me, due to the coupon, it honestly surpassed any burger I've had in the Triangle area and certainly redeemed my first experience here. I'll certainly be back (sooner rather than later), and I'll bring more friends, because this was worth sharing! Major props for a hugely improved experience."}, {"review_id": "qdtq4OInF-GcNxDMv4agSw", "user_id": "kb_u-B0ViGJlqhbHFhjvqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "How's the new year resolution?Whether your still trying or have given up, they have something for you.

This is my fourth time eating at Bad Daddy's. My boyfriend and I had some errands to run in downtown Raleigh, so we decided to stop here for lunch. We are never disappointed; every time we eat here, we get consistently great service and delicious food. My boyfriend always orders a burger with nothing on it, and fries. He says that the meat is so good, he doesn't want to ruin it with toppings. Say whaaaaaaaaaaaat??! That's a rarity, y'all!! I always order some variation of their turkey burger. This turkey burger is probably the best I have ever had. In fact, the meat is seasoned so well, I often forget that I'm eating a turkey burger. On this visit, I had my burger with American cheese, mushrooms and Bad Daddy sauce with tater tots. What is in this \"Bad Daddy's Sauce\", Bad Daddy's??!! It's a MUST for your burgers and tots!! I love it!! We have also tried their homemade potato chips with homemade pimento cheese and onion dips, which was very good. Bad Daddy's has a great selection of beer and drinks too. You can't go wrong with Bad Daddy's!! We always leave happy and full."}, {"review_id": "RBeHgxkZnq6kLG-LvPNCIQ", "user_id": "imnImDsqb-fxrUeuDRnpZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Bad Daddy Burger in Raleigh names #14 best burger in the US!

However, I think this location is my least favorite because it's ALWAYS so packed - doesn't matter if you come in at lunch or a weeknight dinner, it can seem really cramped. Whenever you go somewhere that's super busy, small things always tend to fall by the wayside as servers are only one person and can't be perfect while serving that many people. It's just not as enjoyable of an experience when the service and food prep is rushed. Also there's really no waiting room at all if you have to wait for a table. BUT I keep coming back for those delicious burgers. Well, burger... because I always order the same thing. The BadAss burger is so good! I love the horseradish sauce they put on it. It's always a solid option. But just a warning... it is huge and very messy. You cannot eat this burger with grace so don't even try. I usually order it with a 7 oz patty instead of the 10 oz one it comes with and I still find it difficult to even eat the burger! Their sweet potato fries are delicious as well. Bad Daddy's is a great casual spot in the downtown scene.

The only con is that they don't take reservations, but I've found that if you go during off times that you won't run into too many issues with waiting.
