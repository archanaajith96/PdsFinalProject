Refilling everything from the sugar bowl to our coffees continually & checking in on how we were doing. Our breakfast was delicious with great sized portions. I had the Breakfast Flatbread. The pesto and mozzarella was richly flavored and bacon good quality too. The pancakes were ridiculously thick and fluffy. Quite possibly the best pancake I've ever had. *Highly recommend! Can't wait to come back for dinner in the future"}, {"review_id": "4R4U9aOfW8aMTSzyMMZxew", "user_id": "pbRj6QndaslnwnDxOoFkKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Came back last Tuesday and again...blown away by the food!

Good Italian restaurants are immediately revealed  in the attention to little things; The olive oil for the table was cheap, not even sure if it was olive oil. Shameful. Pared with a solid homemade focaccia. Go figure. The caesar salad was outstanding--a few squeezes of needed fresh lemon juice knocked it out of the park. Here is the test...meatballs. (Think Siena, Anthony's, Avvio) What a disappointment! Horrendous. Inedible. (And this was their featured appetizer!) Right out of a bag from BJ's thrown into a red sauce. The pomodoro sauce--right out of a jar. My wifes dish of veal, chicken and SHRIMP in a Marsala sauce--yuck! What is \"Tuscan\" about that dish? LOL! Nice little place--BYOB was cool...unfortunately they need someone who knows what real Italian food is."}, {"review_id": "GWXEdxh6gUHUOh3pBGpWQg", "user_id": "CUfFGtezQ_23BoNMR7zs7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/13/2017", "text": "Came here for brunch and everything was darn tasty.

After work on Friday I was craving Italian but didn't want to stay in Providence and also didn't want to go far from home. I'm so glad I remembered Sophia's!  Knowing it is small, we called and make a quick reservation before we went, and on arrival, we were seated promptly. We brought a bottle of wine from home, since it's BYOB, and the whole experience was lovely. We skipped appetizers (gladly accepted seconds on the bread and oil though - delish!) and went straight to entrees. I had the scallops and risotto and my husband had the clams and linguine. Neither of us left a bite on our plates!! We weren't going to have dessert but when I saw the bread pudding on the menu I knew I had to have it, and it didn't disappoint. Just a great meal in a nice, neighborhood establishment. I'll definitely save myself some trips to Providence or EG and pop in here more often!"}, {"review_id": "eC-1d4sWn28tts56AT0WBA", "user_id": "RtziTqYw7JpqRqZtm4my0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Tuscan Italian is my favorite and this place did a superb job!!  Atmosphere is very clean and comfortable.  Service was perfect and the waitress was kind enough to gift me the remaining bottle of white wine she had because I did not realize it was a byob place.  Food was cooked perfectly!  Flavor great.  Definitely would go back again."}, {"review_id": "rg7vN07jxJS1Z52w4D0O_A", "user_id": "yJeMm6uT1Caary74NMpLNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "This place is amazing!!! Me and my boyfriend have been here 3 times in the last 2 weeks... once for dinner and twice for their Sunday breakfast. Dinner was amazing, we split the muscles which were the best weve had. I got the Salmon and my boyfriend got the scallops. Both were perfect. the BYOB part is awesome too. Kim was our waitress every time weve been here and shes a peach and the service is top notch. the breakfast here is amazing... their pancakes are crazy good and so is basically everything. will be returning many times and highly recommend!!

Because tables had been reserved, we sat at the bar and Caelob was our server. He was wonderful, really friendly, attentive and funny. We started with a Caesar salad followed by Shrimp Fra Diavlo and Pasta w Clam sauce. Both were absolutely delicious, cooked to order and perfection, and the portions were generous. The homemade focaccia bread and olive oil with roasted garlic dipping sauce were also great.  It's a cute little place, suitable for large groups and or friends or couples. I would recommend calling ahead for reservations on the weekend, as it was quite busy. Also, it's BYO!
