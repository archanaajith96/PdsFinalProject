It was way too much food for one person.  The pho was flavorful, but ended up tasting bland next to the banh mi.  I'll be honest, I'm not a huge banh mi fan... but this place was good!  I also tried a few bites of the curried chicken banh mi which was also tasty! I would definitely come back.  Service was friendly and quick on a weekday lunch."}, {"review_id": "lSUIPhFdQHo1j6vaFlec3Q", "user_id": "FkviJjErkulsl-m2OadZJQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "The interior is what you would expect from a Pho restaurant. The staff are super nice and helpful. They are also very accommodating. The food on the other hand lacked a lot. I only ordered avocado rolls and spring rolls but they were terrible. The lettuce and bean sprouts looked very old and tasted awful. There was an odd flavor in the spring roll I couldn't figure out. I feel like it's super tough to mess up spring rolls but they somehow managed to. The pho might be decent but doubt I'll return to find out."}, {"review_id": "TYmOV8XvW02oqsi4ujz67w", "user_id": "qgOnkdFGKhxQ5lxIpGdqCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "The food here is great, and a good value. Could use a bigger fountain drink size. Could stand to run the air conditioning a little more (they don't kick it on until the ambient temperature is upper 70s) but hey, they're from a hot country. I've had phò, bun ga nuong, and banh mi, each with a variety of items (my work orders from here a lot) and it's all consistent and good. They have a special that's a banh mi with two fried eggs on it...will it change your life? Idk.

The  pho has never disappointed, the broth has good flavor and they go heavy on the meat and noodles. The Banh mi sandwiches are legit as well. I have only ever gotten the avocado one. But it is flavorful and the bread has the perfect amount of crunch and softness to it. The downfalls can be that sometimes it is busy and they don't have a lot of people working so it can be a little slow. Could be slightly cleaner as well in my opinion. If you are in need of a good Banh or so pho then this may be a good option, but I prefer to get it to go."}, {"review_id": "DcVnofqwHGOj1n2lQf673Q", "user_id": "VWv1hF_7WBaayXGcTuYQgA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "The food was decent and basic, served it's purpose.

The toppings are proportional and consistent while the bread is never too hard. I always get a few sandwiches while I'm here. The go to is the Short Rib with the kimchi, it's succulent and sweet at the same time with a tiny hint of spice (ask for jalapenos, they happily oblige). Then I go with the Garlic Ribeye (basically a steak sandwich but loads better with that pickles carrot daikon and jalapenos). Or the House Special which is essentially what typical Bahn Mi should be (I like to this one for the next day, tends to be more flavorful).  For the vegetarian inclined, the girlfriend had given the thumbs up to the Vegan and Lemongrass Tofu (her favorite in the state also, she's now got a few friends hooked on them as well)Do yourself a favor check and check this place out if you are tired of hard burnt bread, inconsistent amount or taste of toppings, and over paying for the \"vibe\""}, {"review_id": "sU1QgrDqZKfl88GFyMAyTA", "user_id": "n521hKNopxJQugQaIRUqGg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "Great place for pho to go or quickly.

I love having this restaraunt. It's such a health alternative to so many other food groups.
