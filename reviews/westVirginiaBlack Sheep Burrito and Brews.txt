Unique flavors that don't seem to make any sense on paper, but I haven't had a single bad experience   here. Favorite tacos are: brisket, chicken, beet and tempura avocado Not in the mood for tacos? The quesadillas are quite delicious, too. Same goes for most of the fare, but trust me. Get the tacos. Brunch is worth coming back for and waiting if there is a wait. My only problem is that they took away the orzo salad- I want that back, thanks."}, {"review_id": "7fKKBR8w51CfzYK3-gKVaQ", "user_id": "V3mQJ_oA_wWnrZGPO-J-aQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Despite being terribly disappointed that the Hawaiian taco is now missing from the menu. I highly recommend the salmon taco as it is excellent.  This time around I tried the avocado  which turned out to be superb. Overall the menu here is quite unique and is something that is not easily found anywhere else . In addition it is paired with Charleston Brewing Company and provides some of the most unique selections of ales around.As for the restaurant, the staff, facilities, and pretty much everything inside and out is clean, well-kept, and looked after and loved by the city of Charleston."}, {"review_id": "PQ-RK-cDX_C7NujWyVSung", "user_id": "ek1vAUCyu-CQU2sZlbWRpQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "I really want to like Black Sheep. I really do! However, I just can't recommend it. This place tries very hard to have a hipster vibe, through the decor and even their menu. I actually dig that about Black Sheep, but at the end of the day, the food has to be good.... And that's where they miss the mark. Don't get me wrong, it's not awful by any means, but with a lot of the unique items offered on their menu you'd expect that their entrees would be bursting with flavor. They're not though, and in fact I found most of the food I've had there to be rather bland. I've been to Black Sheep 3 times now and hoped that maybe the experience would improve. Unfortunately, it didn't improve at all. On my most recent visit, I decided to order the salsa trio for the table. The trio consisted of Pico de Galo, Black Bean & Corn, and Fire Roasted Tomato. My friend and I both agreed that the Fire Roasted Tomato was the best. The Black Bean & Corn wasn't terrible and the Pico de Galo was pretty standard. I'd probably just order the Fire Roasted Tomato instead of the trio if I had it to do over again.For my entree, I decided to keep it simple and go with the Baaa'd Ass Burrito w/chicken. I chose to have the Pico and \"Death Sauce\" on the side, and I'm happy that I did as the \"Death Sauce\" isn't very good. In fact, it's not even all that hot (I like hotter food). The Burrito itself was rather boring. Chocked full of rice, with a little bit of chicken and cheese. The Lime-Siracha crema was fairly non-existent. So all in all, a fairly unspectacular meal that was consistent with my other trips here. Needless to say, there probably won't be a fourth trip."}, {"review_id": "lr942g0gz99tBKb6omXxRg", "user_id": "sx7Vz9diETOcho1yWAGddA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Stayed in the city overnight on our way to VA and decided to give this place a try since it's local and gets good reviews. The food and beer was good, but our service wasn't great. Most of the staff seemed really friendly but our server had a gruff attitude and it was clear they all wanted to leave, even though we came several hours before closing. They were already putting all of the chairs up and sending people home because of a tiny sprinkling of snow. Typical Virginian mentality of \"I just saw a snowflake! Close everything!\" They even sent the host home and started turning people away...on a Friday night, no less. Really? I would have been frustrated if we had shown up later and couldn't get in because they decided to lock their doors well before their posted closing time. I have to give them props for their menu and willingness to experiment with flavors. I really liked the Asian-Mexican fusion items on the menu. I don't think I would go out of my way to eat here again, but it's a solid place to try if you happen to be in the area."}, {"review_id": "TZ7Fw-1-3fH-O6EWKUYeMA", "user_id": "vfbMzNYONKthoibxjBrLQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Stopped in while on the road for vacation.  I ordered  the flock of tacos, all were delicious.  My wife got the General Tsos burrito, which was decent.  Samples a couple beers and got a pint of cloud machine, which was a delicious hazy ipa.  Cool atmosphere right in downtown and attentive staff.  You can see through windows from the bar into the brewing area.

Here are the two Burritos I've tasted:1) Breakfast- This thing is mammoth and out of this world if you are into breakfast burritos. This one has Bacon, Scrambled Egg, Lime-Sriracha Crema, Black Bean and Corn Salsa, & Monterey Jack. It has tons of flavor and is very filling. Highly recommend. 2) Bulgogi - I'm a big fan of Korean food, and this burrito is so unique! It's not something I would have every day, but it was also delicious. The staff here were great, and the service was fast. Both times I came here for lunch it was fairly busy, but we never had too long of a wait.

Always. I was so thankful for Black Sheep that night, because I didn't want to get stuck eating just plain ole lettuce. So I went to Black Sheep and got a salad with plain ole lettuce that was loaded with deliciousness! Tofu, beans, roasted red peppers, cashews, all in the Black Sheep salad. It was so flavorful and filling. It's great that this city in WV has great dietary accommodations for vegan, vegetarian, gluten free...I sat at the bar and got a local beer as well, had some good conversation with the people at the bar, and it was so nice! I'm one of those people that absolutely doesn't mind going and sitting by myself. I may be a little nervous going to a bar surrounded by others, but the people here (some from town, some not) were super. I didn't break the bank coming here after a meal and a drink.

Tso at any Chinese place just because I love it.  I expected a burrito with the same type of fried chicken medallions covered in sauce, but it was actually grilled chicken...Essentially a regular mexican burrito but they added General Tso sauce to it which came out kind of weird.  My order was for carry out, so I didn't have a lot of interaction with the staff but they seemed nice."}, {"review_id": "3tEgGtz-k7CfTURXiD1oPQ", "user_id": "dSGs7NshcDQnayEDx1McHg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Ordered burritos to go at the bar.
