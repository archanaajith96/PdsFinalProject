The Kunafa they have is excellent I have had a lot of kunafa in my life and this is one of the best. I like coming here when I miss food back home, it's great coming here and my friend loved it. I haven't tried the other things they have but they all looked delicious except I can't help but just stuff myself with that cheesy dessert.Would I come here again, absolutely. It was worth the stop in my 4 hour ride."}, {"review_id": "eOY_CH1MnPXvQy_eObI2Hg", "user_id": "l0cLj74yfShexrfP-erQzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Great dessert place and open late! The kunafeh was delicious and not too sweet. Sometimes I feel the syrup makes it too sweet, but Alhamadanya is just right. I also got a fried dough item filled with custard - very delicious. The owner is so sweet! The space is small only 3 table and counter space for 3."}, {"review_id": "_z6gmqHdIlcfXatKO3nxYg", "user_id": "51QE3k7tlbYB1Dzx2OLD2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "What can I say but that this is by far the best mideastern pastry shop in the area! I'm literally obsessed with this little Iraqi pastry filled with the creamiest, yummiest custard ever! I'm not ashamed to say that I could eat a whole tray of it! It's that good! And don't let the location throw you off. Inside is a heavenly delight with friendly and generous owners."}, {"review_id": "fCnFVqMryyrC9x2kXIH3HA", "user_id": "IrPzTz8WxbIDZQ3wdV4aBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Very good place!!

It was absolutely delicious to have a plate of this stuff. The portions looked small but with the sugar water on top, it was like eating the tastiest brick!Ok that's not the best way to describe it but it really is a heavy dessert. A great night cap if you can handle it too. They open very late, something past midnight? Which is crazy convenient for anyone looking for a dessert late at night. The place is tiny too, it won't fit 10 people and even when it's empty you still feel that you don't have much room to walk around. Not a great place to hang out in, but truly great knafa to eat quick or take with on the go."}, {"review_id": "kRfz8Qy--_b5JHkCEzSCzQ", "user_id": "qKkPVNs46SYvmnpk6nnxzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Very good sweets: We bought the Jalebi, Baklava, almond cookies, Kanafeh with syrup.

However, most of them have reached their peak. They just don't taste as good as they used to. Sometimes they are dry too. Al-Hamadanya stayed true to their customers. The flavors of their sweets (i.e. Knafah) have not worsened, and the customer service is still A1. Every time I visit, I am offered a free sample sweet. If you have a sweet tooth, or itching to try some Arab desserts definitely DEFINITELY stop by here. You will not find a better shop than this."}, {"review_id": "6M8-Hp6zZIyUb5XkpjPGkQ", "user_id": "o1dy7Lf4TdwRoVI8AP2eiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "My husband and I loved this place!
