My grandma makes an oxtail dish back home and this is exactly what it reminded me of and with the tostones it was like my grandma had cooked it herself, so this definitely gave me a feeling of being back home sitting in my grandmas house enjoying a meal prepped with love.  The food was so good that later the same night I took my girlfriend to eat here, she isn't the most adventurous eater and she even loved it.  She had the brown chicken with rice and peas and maduros (she loved it), while I had jerk chicken with those amazing tostones and one of cheesier Mac and cheeses around.  Do not be afraid of trying this island cuisine especially not from here it's delicious. Oh! the dessert is great too I'm not a pudding fan and I actually thoroughly enjoyed the banana pudding from here. Hope this helps."}, {"review_id": "Hug6g9JtzsBBTmIjyGlsfQ", "user_id": "SnfkD8KSvK7syoEQN2ItWw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "So I've been seeing all the rave reviews for the Cutlass Grille and decided to try it for lunch. The place is clean and has a beachy feel. It's too dark though. I couldn't read my menu without the light on my phone. I tried the dark meat lunch special with two sides: Mac and cheese and friend plantains. The food came out quickly. Let's start with the sides. Both were a decent portion, without being too big.  The Mac and cheese was good. The fried plantains we're also fine. No complaints for the sides. Now, let's get to the chicken. The jerk chicken tasted great. It really was very good. The problem was the amount. When the server was delivering the place to me, the first thing I noticed was how little chicken was on the plate. Of all things, THAT was the first thing I noticed.  And it gets worse. Once I started eating the chicken, I realized OVER HALF the chicken on the plate was bones. Maybe even 2/3 of the chicken was bone.  I can honestly say there was less than a tablespoon of actual chicken meat on the plate. I asked the waitress if this was the norm and she said yes. I actually am quite disappointed, considering how good it was. I would have given this place 5 stars without hesitation, if it wasn't for the complete lack of jerk chicken in a jerk chicken meal. I feel slightly ripped off."}, {"review_id": "1GB8GBatR_TCg39kgaP6Fg", "user_id": "nZKnG2KEen3pM6Y2BxBoDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Haven't been in years but remembered how good it was and had to return.

My friend and I came for lunch. It wasn't full and we were seated fast. Specials were listed on the chalkboard. I got curry chicken, collards and fried plantains. Friend got stewed chicken, rice and peas and collards. Food came out in about 5 minutes! My food was delicious. And it was dark meat, a big leg and a thigh cut in half. Plantains just as sweet and succulent like I was in the Caribbean. Our waitress  was attentive until she dropped the check off and them she disappeared for about 20 minutes! We were trying to hit the mall before we went back to work and she messed that all up. Finally she comes back, I give her my card and she's gone another 12 minutes. Not sure what was going on with her, but no worries; next time I'll just sit at the bar. Lunch special was only $10."}, {"review_id": "ldPD3P3iG-LiCu0KxdZNbw", "user_id": "bmWgE02eCyCFXlMbF-bUrg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Hands down the best jerk chicken in Hampton Roads! Cutlass smokes all their meats so the flavor is booming & the white meat is very moist & tender. The Mac & Chz is baked but very creamy & has a spiciness that I can't seem to put my finger on, it's probably a spice from the islands that I'm not used to but I love it! If you eat in you also get some warm bread that you definitely need with the jerk bc it is pretty spicy. I really love this place"}, {"review_id": "iWmr5wxsRBqju15RhIAUQw", "user_id": "rOnUyEY3MlRDe-tPEHLYlg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "I've only heard good things about CG and decided to try it myself. This is my second visit as I didn't want to judge too soon but they have consistently been GOOD! They seat you promptly and the hostess and servers on both occasions were cheerful and pleasant. First visit we just missed the lunch specials by 10 minutes  so I headed to the dinner menu and was not let down by my selection. The curry shrimp, plantains, MAC n cheese we're sooooooooo good! My cousin ordered the jerk chicken white meat with collards and MAC and again it was bomb. On the second trip I went for the jerk chicken and she had the oxtails, my hubby did the jerk chicken sandwich and my cuz in law did the red snapper .. everything was so flavorful. This will be a regular spot for good, Jamaican food. The service was nice and the atmosphere cool.

Told father in law to get the brown stew chicken. He didn't listen. He got brisket. He said it was eh. Mother in law is smart. She listened. He tried hers and said he should have gotten that. Why don't men listen to women?! My son LOVES the Jamaican rice and peas. And the macaroni and cheese. Or maybe I love to make him get it so I can steal bites. Go to order - brown stew chicken with Jamaican rice and peas and macaroni and cheese. Order it. Trust me. Actually don't. Cuz sometimes they run out of the brown stew chicken, and my whole day is ruined. My whole week. And I'm not me when I'm hungry. They added lamb chops to their appetizer menu and those are so flipping good. Probably the best best best lamb chops ever. WARNING. They are spicy. My father in law is the biggest weenie with spice and they were definitely too spicy for him , but he kept eating them anyway!!! Please keep these forever."}, {"review_id": "Y5R6pb0faL7KiiThYtvPRQ", "user_id": "gN6Shiw0ep_1x55LTURDdg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "I ordered take out from here yesterday. I was super excited to try out a new Caribbean restaurant being that it is my favorite style of food. I saw all of the stars for this place and could not wait to try it. The woman I spoke with over the phone was polite. When I got there to pick my food up, I was shocked that it was already done being that she told me it would take about 15 minutes, and I got there in about 5 minutes because I was already in route. The atmosphere was nice and they had an open bar.When I got my food I was disappointed. They definitely do not give you a lot of food, compared to other Caribbean restaurants in the area. I ordered jerk chicken with one side. I LOVE Caribbean food and I know good/authentic Caribbean food when I taste it. The chicken and rice was very bland. Had zero flavor, even with the gravy on top of my rice and peas. The chicken was dry as well. I wanted to go back but I had an appointment to attend. I really wanted to like this place being that it is a close Caribbean restaurant by my house. Maybe they were having an off day so I will give it another try in the future."}, {"review_id": "RjfZAW9a4QjwcCpc_h_sNQ", "user_id": "aTHvXRF8zH-DRRmT48XoXw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I'm a regular here and The owner is so nice he comes around and speaks too all his customers any problems you have he will address.

As we came in, we were greeted nicely and were promptly seated. We noticed the very unique decor and it was really cool! There were things that screamed out authentic Jamaican place and it was a cool dive place that presented that. As we were making small talk with the waitress, if I remember correctly since this was awhile back, is that the owner has various locations.We were all hungry so we decided to split an appetizer and we got the Tostones Nachos. Um, yeah there was nothing left and we completely demolished it! It wasn't like any nachos we ever had as there were less chips as the plantains were the \"chips\". It was filling and something that we all enjoyed together. My friends also got the coconut water and it was unlike any water I've had before. It was refreshing and sweet with the texture of flesh being amazing as well. I managed to resist getting one and just sat there sadly with my water.Our dishes all came in and all of us got the same thing except my one friend who got the Curry Goat and it was what I expected. It was tender and amazing curry but the gamey-ness was still present. He said that it reminded him of authentic Jamaican food so that was good enough for us as we took his word for it. We all got the brisket and sides. I got the macaroni and cheese with some green beans. Um, yeah it was all amazing! They gave a good portion of brisket to the point where I was surprised. It didn't taste like Texan barbecue which is okay because it had it's own flavor! The macaroni and cheese was fantastic and I couldn't get enough of it! My friend didn't finish his so I obliged to help him. If I were ever in town and this is within driving distance, I would definitely visit back again! I can see why this place is popular and my mouth misses that food I had as I think about it."}, {"review_id": "-om_VW_OLoLoyUQXlJq9gw", "user_id": "qpRfrQVIhAjdVCZL_zQqwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "They never disappoint.  Staff is always friendly and food is outstanding.  You definitely will not walk away hungry.  Plenty to eat on the plate.  Recommend this place!!"}, {"review_id": "AkbC_SEcEZci-fAZzo1XlA", "user_id": "i3D8K968pfnYQ6Q_Ec8Hgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/11/2017", "text": "I love this place !!!

This place was fairly full for a late lunch; it was around 2PM when we arrived. When my water came out it had a fly in it.. i informed our waitress and she just took my drink and didn't apologize until she gave me a new one..To start, I got the mini beef patties and these were very delicious. The crust was light, flaky and crispy and the beef was just so tasty and juicy. It came with a some sort of island dipping sauce which was great as well. For my main entree I got the curry goat which I thought was okay; the only I remember was that the goat was a dry and I couldn't finish it bc of that. The service was okay and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely come back and get those beef patties again.
