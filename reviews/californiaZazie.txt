I recomend to try to grab a table on the back patio- its gorgeous! They have heaters and it is covered for the colder days. Truly makes you feel like youve stepped out of the city and into the countryside somewhere... that is until you look up and see the surrounding typical San Francisco victorian buildings. So casual here, and it is so cozy! Mimoas here are delicious, but so is their coffee (which is always served in cute little bowls). I always order a cappuccino with cinnamon and honey on the side. I have never ordered anything here i didnt like, from their coffee cake, to their benedicts, scrambles, or even their granola.... everything deserves a 5 star rating. If you havent been here yet, what are you waiting for? Its also close to GGP and Haight street, so its a good place to stop if youre checking either of those out."}, {"review_id": "WVTo_N-wjzo-AgjdS5Xjdw", "user_id": "DZvKl9yXLDobhI2mdTFICQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "The wait for brunch is expectedly long because SF peeps looooove their brunch. My friend put our names down early and when the host called us, we were waiting on a couple of people. He then made a comment about not liking liars, which I found a little rude. But I think he thought it was funny? The service was quick, the waiter was nice, and the food was amazing. The New York scramble (pictures below) had good portions of salmon, eggs, cheese, etc. (nothing was overwhelming). The mango mimosa was unique and delicious.

I still think about those fluffy, delicious pancakes. Also, Zazie's prices include tip which is awesome for convenience sake and for workers' benefits! Cherry on the top of a perfect brunch.

Hype: lived up to. Expectations: exceeded. Bellies: distended. Come with full pockets and empty stomachs; leave with full stomachs and empty pockets. Omelette du jour: it's not a huge stretch to think that putting garlic in things will make them taste better, but somehow in my life no one has ever put garlic in my omelette. Buddy, lemme tell you the difference it makes. The Portobello mushroom and tomato within were unabashedly garlicky. If you choose the fries instead of the salad, you'll be rewarded with gorgeously crispy potatoes and FRIED GARLIC. I LOVE garlic. I LOVE crunchy things. I LOVE paying like 18 dollars for an omelette, wondering how you can charge that much for one slab of rolled egg, and then allowing the sweet stench of garlic to wash such economic worries from the mind. Ahhh. French toast Tahiti: gushy and sweet and gooey. Pain de mine: French toast with orange cinnamon batter and fruit. Sounded like a blast, but it didn't taste as impressive as the description sounded. Skippable. Service: awesome. Come early cause the wait is something fierce. We got there at 9am and waited about 10 min for a table of 2. Cost:Coffee + omelette + 2 different slices French toast = $56 for 2 people = $28 per person, no tip necessary, and while it is far from a cheap brunch, the satisfaction of an amazing meal and knowing the staff have health insurance, dental benefits, and a 401k make it an expense you can bear with.

Come here before 10 am on a weekday to snag a spot all by yourself. I had the back patio to myself. By 10:30, the place was full of an elitist hash: the junkie rock n roll couple visiting from la, the 1st year UCSF med school couple skipping anatomy for a quick upscale bite, the old paleo conservative in the corner drooling waiting for his latte and dreaming of Ike Eisenhower and the quiet French backpackers cursing American \"portions\" and still confounded by the trump-macron bromance. I had the divorceé Benedict's: bacon, fontina cheese & avocado. I told the waitress I loved the roasted garlic cloves in the home fries. She told me she hates it when the other patrons don't. I told her that they should be deported from the Bay Area. IFinished with a slice of the French toast tahini which was stuffed with banana purée and topped with caramelized bananas. Thank you Zazie. Oh, and now a word from them: __+++++Zazie+++++__ is tip free! Our menu prices include a living wage, revenue sharing, paid sick leave, fully funded insurance, paid parental leave & 401(k).

It was a nice day outside so we walked around. We finally got seated in the front booth area (which is a little awkward because it's right in the window). We started with a few of the mojitos (wow, they have quite an extensive selection) and the seasonal cinnamon roll. The roll was fantastic, soft, moist and flavorful. The service was a little inattentive (probably didn't help that we were way in the front of the restaurant in the window/nook area. I ordered the eggs vincent. The dish was good, it was essentially polenta (which I'm typically a fan of). My sister was a huge fan of her eggs benedict. The brunch menu is quite extensive, especially the eggs benedict section if you're a fan of that dish. I'm not sure if this place was good enough to warrant a visit back with a wait of that caliber (maybe 30m?). It was also relatively expensive - probably because they offer incredible benefits for their employees and they're tip free. I'd recommend giving this place a shot if you're in the area and trying it out for yourself."}, {"review_id": "DVZBZaxb-rPRt7QlgAY-OQ", "user_id": "CsyV3FeUNujVcvqe6kMnFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "I went to Zazie for a dinner with a couple of friends for the first time last week. It is a super cute restaurant with a really great ambiance. It would make a cute date spot for sure. They also include tips in all of their pricing so there is no need to tip at the end.They have a great selection of wine and have really really tasty mimosa combinations and I'm not talking about your typical traditional mimosas these have wonderful exotic flavors. For dinner I ordered the Le Canard Piallat which was a beautifully cooked duck leg served with potato salad and haricots verts. It was simply delicious! We then opted to all share a dessert and we chose the Le Deux Cremes. It was a chocolate pot de creme and creme brulee. Both were very rich and super yummy. Overall, I definitely want to go back to Zazie, I definitely want to hit it up for brunch. The service was great and the food was amazing!

It's a small little place and I believe they have a garden out back. From the small glimpse I got, the garden looked beautiful and I am sure it was because there was a wedding reception going on. There was quite a wait to be seated inside. You sign your name in and they will call your name when there are seats. I recommend coming here for a lunch date for 2 to 4 people. Seating is pretty small and mostly for 2. They can put tables together, but I'm sure the wait would be a little longer. The seating in the front of the restaurant is first come first serve, so you don't have to put your name down for it. Just grab the table as soon as you see someone get up. The service is amazing. The staff always checked on us.  Boyfriend got a omelette. It was the special for the day. It was filled with sausage, mushrooms and some other things. I was too focused on my food to remember his. It was tasty though. Food wasn't too salty. The omelette did have a little run in the middle, but my boyfriend lives for that. I got the crab Benedict. It was delicious! You can ask for 1 or 2 eggs. It comes with a side of salad. They do not skimp you on the crab meat. It's pretty light and the salad goes really well, which left room for all the sweets I ordered. We got French toast Tahiti and miracle pancakes. You get to choose how many slices of French toast or pancake you want. The French toast came with caramelized bananas and in between the slices of toast there were some crushed walnuts mixed in cinnamon. It was pretty delicious. Definitely got my French toast fix. Appreciated that it wasn't that sweet and that the center of my French toast wasn't a soggy texture. The pancakes though!!! The miracle pancakes are really a miracle. It had poppy seeds and a lemon sauce with strawberries! It was freaking to die for. It's perfection! It's everything! I believe it was part of the special menu. I'd go back just for that! I'd go back for all of that! As for the drinks, I got the chai tea with almond milk. It comes in a big ol' bowl! Loved every bit of it. It wasn't too sweet and it was just right. The boyfriend got the lemonade soda thing. It was just the right amount of tang, but my drink was greater than his drink. Overall, really great experience. Definitely recommend to go."}, {"review_id": "_3aZ9WlOHjN-Go2IO9YOew", "user_id": "8bHVd-Nhssr5e7J7nYfSbw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Found this cute little brunch spot before visiting the Cal Academy of Sciences nearby.  Enjoyed a yummy meal in a beautiful setting.Parking and Seating:  Since the restaurant is in SF there is not designated parking, but we were able to find street parking just a few blocks away.  The interior of the restaurant makes you feel like you've been transported to France. It's adorable decorated  and has a very cozy atmosphere.  We asked to sit on the back patio, and if the weather is good I totally recommend it! It's a small space cloaked in vines and greenery, and it's absolutely beautiful. The perfect spot for a nice quiet brunch.Vegetarian options:  There were quite a few yummy options to pick from.  To avoid having to decide my friend and I decided to share the Eggs Vincent (grilled corn cake with spinach, avocados, spicy goat cheese, and poached eggs) and Fresh Lemon Ricotta raviolis.  The flavors were simple but well balanced, and it was overall a yummy meal.  I do wish the portions were slightly larger for the prices, but otherwise I had no issues with the food.Cocktails:  I would definitely recommend this place if you like mimosas with your brunch because the widest range of options and some of the most unusual placer combos I have ever seen.  They infuse their mimosas with flavors like mint and elderflower, and instead of using juice they add small scoops of sorbet. So refreshing! We ordered the special \"Magic Mimosa\" which contained mint and green apple sorbet, and it was so delicious! They will even let you customize the flavor of your mimosa. The options are endless.Service:  The staff was nice and attentive, and the service was all-around very quick.I'll be keeping this spot in mind for the next time I'm in this part of the city.  Definitely want to revisit to other mimosa flavors"}, {"review_id": "jZK1aAFzqw0vicmCCtAgqw", "user_id": "r-Ef5OYdAdvIDKw18wlBNQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "We got lucky and came on a Monday morning and were able to snag a table outside right away. They don't tip here so the prices are pretty high but ended up spending about the same amount as we probably would anywhere else. The food was delicious! I'm omitting 1 Star specifically for service. I knew that our server was working really hard so I don't think it was his fault. I'm guessing they were understaffed in general but...We waited for a good 15 minutes before being able to order even a coffee. Once we did order it was another 10 minutes or so before the coffee reached our table. Typically you get coffee right away. And at no point during our meal were we offered refills on the coffee... maybe they don't come with refills but the cup is pretty tiny so I went through it pretty fast.

Although the menu says tipping is unnecessary, we always do. The thing we love about Zazie the most is the freshness of their food. I was surprised that they even make their own condiments! We usually order the St. Trop: smoked salmon Benedict & the La Mer: Crab Benedict. I believe most of there savory dishes come with a roasted garlic, which we absolutely LOVVVVVVVVE!!!(who cares about garlic breath!) Takes the flavors to a whole other level!As for sweets, the miracle pancakes are great but the French Toast Tahiti is bommmmmb.com.

I came here on a Tuesday for brunch at 11am. We were seated right away, with our choice of indoor or outdoor seating, which was lovely. I mean, this is expected for a Tuesday anyway, right? Anyway, my friend and I ordered food within 10 mins of getting there. We didn't receive our food until 11:40am!!!! Omg. Mind you, the restaurant is only 50% full of customers. So basically, half empty.Not only that, but the food was disappointing. I ordered the Genevieve scramble, which comes with black forest ham, white cheddar, and haas avocados, with your choice of toast and home fries or salad. To be honest, the scramble was too watery and cheesy. A weird combo. Usually avocados can save the day, but they barely put any. Maybe 1/4 of a small avocado. The home fries were too crispy, slightly burnt. The service was frustrating. Yes, they were extremely friendly and seemed to love their job. However, why the hell did it take half an hour to get our food?! The whole restaurant was NOT even slammed at all. It seemed like the cooks in the back were on their 30 min lunch break. And why did it take another hour to get our check?! I wish they were more attentive to us. I don't know WHY they AUTOMATICALLY include service charge when their service is ABSOLUTE CRAP. If I am paying for your health insurance, and automatic tip, I expect top of the line service. It says on their website that, \"All of our menu prices include a living wage, revenue share, paid family leave, fully funded health & dental insurance, paid time off, and a 401(k) with employer match for all of our hard working employees.\"I should have complained that their employees are NOT hard working. It is employees like these that expect high wages, great benefits, for sitting on their butts while working. I know another job for them; it's called an office job. It also says on their website that they're, \"Proud to be tip free.\" There is nothing prideful about providing employees work where they can just act however they want, while still receiving tips regardless.Never coming back here."}, {"review_id": "hXDt-JeQUQwrZDDK-xrk5Q", "user_id": "1msVg_B-Ef6K814sQDOTPA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Zazie has a super cute ambience and fresh food, but I waited upwards of 40 minutes for my food on a Friday afternoon at 11:30 AM.

On the flip side, I've heard a wait of 1-2 hours is expected and we waited about 15-20 minutes -- but the total waiting time for seating + food was probably the same in total, so were we really that \"lucky\"?My party of 3 ordered:Tahiti French Toast ($18) Omelette du Jour ($18)Eggs Benedict - Albert with 2 eggs ($21) I appreciate that the French toast and eggs Benedict had options to pick 1, 2 or 3 piece(s)/egg(s) because most brunch places always give me too much French toast and taking leftover French toast just isn't the same. Otherwise the ingredients were obviously fresh and the potatoes were super good! Wish they had been more generous with their potato portions and not sure if I'll be back, but I heard the back patio is super pretty so maybe if I'm feeling brunchy I'll give Zazie another shot.

Service was spectacular.  Prompt delivery of food and drinks, with friendly chatting.  Food - we had a simple salad with goat cheese, the polenta squares, and white trout.  The polenta sat in an awesome tomato based sauce.  The trout was cooked perfectly.   Lemon cake to share - incredibly good.  We sat outside on the patio under the canvas cover on a night when it rained - monsoon-like rain.  The wind blew rain onto us diners. We didn't get too wet and it added to the outdoor patio experience.  If its raining, shoes your seats wisely. I highly recommend Zazzie's.  An economic note - Zazzie's advertises that it pays its staff a living wage, provides medical and retirement benefits and so on.  They do not have a tip line on the CC bills.  No tipping.  I like that Zazie's has built a business model that charges an amount to pay for staff benefits and a wage that does not require tipping.  I did not consider the cost of the meal to be out of line with other SF restaurants.  I do not like when restaurants (like some in, for example, San Mateo) add a surcharge to the bill to cover minimum wage increases or other mandated costs.  This is a cost of doing business in a city and state that has decided to be \"progressive\" and the restaurant has chosen to do business there.  They should all do as Zazie's has done - get over it and charge what is necessary to make a restaurant in a high cost of living location work.  I applaud how Zazie's is making the economics of having a business in SF work for them and their staff."}, {"review_id": "iW4ozO6-GJQQ-M2tdFGCFA", "user_id": "9GXefqyQmPT60SbNZ2Ufvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "My fiancé and I have been planning on trying this place out and decided to try this place out on a week day since it's packed on the weekends but OH MAN was it packed on a Tuesday morning!!!
