It's a great place for average bbq and long lines. Ever since it made it in one of those cooking shows I've always wanted to go. But it's all hype. You could find better bbq in run down shacks along memorial drive for half the price. Parking was the worst. Your literally crammed into random spots. So if you have a nice car and don't want dings I wouldn't recommend it. The ribs had a beef jerky texture to it and Mac and cheese was so dry. Our server kept forgetting to refill my sweet tea. We asked for the check and waited and waited and waited. Finally flagged down another waiter and he got the waiter to get our check.

Service - immediately greeted upon entrance, text option to let you know your table is ready but the host offered us to sit at the bar to avoid the 25 mins wait for party of 2 indoors. It's a small bar, like maybe 8 seats max but the bartender was so fast and efficient at multi-tasking and making drinks for the whole restaurant. Every time food was delivered, the person would say enjoy and it was ready so fast!!! Food - omg the brisket was so tender and flavorful, gotta order it fatty! Jalapeño cheddar sausage was good, you can taste the melted cheddar. Ribs were decent. BBQ sauce was yummy. I liked it mixed with the spicy BBQ sauce together for a kick and tang. I almost bought a bottle home to Cali but didn't want to check my luggage! The jalapeño cornbread is also worth trying with real jalapeño and corn pieces, and the honey butter complements it very well. The brisket chili was really good. The Fox-a-roni (Mac and cheese topped with stew) was good....unique but I think I would have preferred trying the stew and Mac and cheese separately. The stew overpowered the Mac. Drinks - Though they have a wide variety of drinks on the menu it would have been extremely helpful if the beer list included the specific type of beer versus simply categorizing. I had to google what \"Sweet Water Blue\" was. Which was a wheat ale enhanced with blueberries; it paired well with our meal! Note - if you are to order the combo plates and if you wanted the jalapeño cheddar sausage, do not order it as an item! Because 2 items are $18, 3 items $25, $4 items $30 and to add the sausage as a solo item it is only $4. So my point is we would have saved $3 if we got 2 item combo plate and added 1 sausage for $18+$4=$22 rather than $25 for 3 items. Hey, money saved is money earned!!"}, {"review_id": "iCKN89Ckq9mOtJZzSsM-3A", "user_id": "xl9Rcs-cW9Vt4140HR03nA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Holy crap.

Definitely one of the highlights of my trip was those ribs. Every bite was so flavorful and juicy, and the meat fell off the bone effortlessly. We had a lot left over, and we made sure to freeze them for the ride home. The beef brisket was also good, but so disappointing compared to the ribs. It was slightly dry and not as tasty, but still one of the best I've had anywhere. I probably should've ate the brisket first and then the ribs. We also got some sides, which were pretty tiny. I enjoyed the mac and cheese and the tater tots, both were really solid. Fox Bros. puts West Coast barbecue to shame. It's well worth the visit! If I were to come again, I would try the pulled pork and wings, but I'll definitely order the ribs a second time."}, {"review_id": "CDJpauEL1GT8Rx7s9GmyLw", "user_id": "1N4HNCbMIead4r_22jseHw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "If you are in Atlanta and craving BBQ, suggest heading over to Fox Bros BBQ.  The vibe and restaurant look & feel are like a Texas BBQ joint and the food will feed your crave.  The owners grew up in Texas so this definitely contributes to the Texas inspiration of the place.There are two Fox Bros BBQ locations in Atlanta, if you are looking for sit-down table dining. be sure you hit the 1238 Dekalb Ave Ne location.  The other location \"Fox Bros.

I would've loved to try the fried okra- but they use fresh not frozen, and it's currently out of season- cannot wait to go back and try them!My pork had A LOT of fat but no biggie- just picked it off. super moist (hate that word) meat. The BBQ sauces were good- the spicy one definitely has a kick! loved the spiced green beans- super tasty. The fries are hadn't cut and weren't crisp or soggy but just right as goldilocks would say.The chicken they have is smoked and usually served as a half- not pulled.I would for sure recommend here to others with the stipulation of parking and crowds."}, {"review_id": "GRPACmGRnN_ri2hW8ZbbTA", "user_id": "JW5W4OZCohTvZlRF1jzrTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Very cool spot with great service, very good beer list and pretty good bbq. I came here on a Monday night and it was packed. I grabbed a stool at the counter in the bar section. That area was first come first serve. The bar itself was small and had about 6 chairs. But the space was pretty big with over 20 tables indoors and over five tables outside (with heat lamps). I ordered the two meat combo with brisket and ribs, with baked beans, mac and cheese and cornbread. The food came out in like 15 minutes. The ribs were amazing. They were so soft. They literally came right off the bone. The beans were well flavored and tasted fresh. The mac and cheese was delicious and super cheesy and creamy. I didn't love the brisket. It was chopped which was weird. The portion I got was fattier than any brisket I've had. Other than that the meal was great. And I got a whole lot of food for less than $20.

He also order the only burger they have on the menu. It was ok nothing to fancy about. They didn't rush us out after we finished eating.
