It's in a little neighborhood of little Italy.Ask for the best pizza they got and they'll answer in a snap of a finger. Also got CPR pizza which I have no regret. Got meatballs on the house which was cool.Can get busy- little loud inside. Will definitely go again once I burn these calories off- ate too much."}, {"review_id": "nBzuJd0Eg47Gx1m9i5jVAA", "user_id": "cM18DJYdmxjqj3zc97Huxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "As if finishing every last ounce of the pizza wasn't enough (don't be a quitter people, finish what you start!), we got the chocolate hazelnut Nutella cream puff balls...and all I can say is GET THESE!!!!

And rave reviews from the wisdom of the crowds?!?Everything was a winning combination, but for whatever reason my experience just felt... milquetoast (or, should I say, milquefocaccia?). I met up for supper with a friend who is a long-time Baltimore resident and had great things to say about Joe Benny's. The restaurant, which is nestled in a traditional Little Italy rowhouse, was practically empty so we were served right away. It's cute and cosy, with a big blackboard menu behind the bar and several intimate tables. We got a nice table-for-two and set about pondering our cheese-and-carb laden fate. I opted for the Firore ($14), meatballs mixed with plenty of red sauce and cheese on fluffy focaccia. The focaccia was soft and bouncy, and the portion generous - but I just couldn't see what about my Sicilian-style pizza gave it that 5-star oomph. When I'm craving pizza but not willing to wait/spend, I'll heap Trader Joe's marinara on some naan and top it with melted mozz + veggies. I'm not a good chef, but my focaccia tasted like a slightly better version of my MacGyver-ed pizza. By the time I was full, I had about two leftover slices to take home (it is pretty darn filling), but I don't think it lived up to the price tag.We also ordered both flavours of cream puffs offered at the time (chocolate hazelnut and lemon cheesecake). They were, like the focaccia, tasty but not special. They don't have a full kitchen, so our server just popped the puffs out of the freezer to thaw. Unfortunately, our balls were still a bit frozen in the centre and the pastry puff seemed stiff with freezer burn. :/ Unsure if they're made fresh in-house and then stored, since the kitchen is tiny. Either way, adorable neighbourhood joint with comfortable, unpretentious food. Personally, I was mystified by the hype, but maybe I'm just missing something?"}, {"review_id": "mo0FSAC1FgvYFYtK1_gmwQ", "user_id": "GlTfRqnb2vDP6-zsZas5ew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Wow the meatballs!!!

Well let me tell me...IT DID!!! We got here close to opening right after 5 on a Thursday evening. We knew the place was small so we wanted to make sure we could get a seat. The pics with the bench seating are old, they now have individual high top tables passed the bar, and it works great. Of course we all got pizza, I got the plain and simple made spicy; friend had the Angie, and her daughter got the Fiore. My pizza was delicious. Thick bread, right amount of cheese/sauce ratio, and the charred edges were divine!!! I tried the Angie (minus the meat since I don't eat beef or pork) and it was amazing!!!!!!! Next time I go back, that's what I'm getting without the prosciutto. I didn't try the Fiore because there were meatballs all over, but they both said that was super good too!As if finishing every last ounce of the pizza wasn't enough (don't be a quitter people, finish what you start!), we got the chocolate hazelnut Nutella cream puff balls...and all I can say is GET THESE!!!!

Expect to wait 30+ mins. This is a small place.The food is phenomenal. The meatballs were dense spheres with a juicy balance of veal, beef, and pork. They maintain excellent italian seasoning. The bread is buttery and crumbly with an loose crumb.The pizza had massive light and fluffy focaccia that is just oily enough and well seasoned. The sauce is sweet and savoury for a perfect complement to the bread. The sausage was a bit small and crumbly and could have been more widely cut but the flavors were complex, savoury, and tinted with fennel. The pepper were soft. Joe Bennys was excellent. Definitely go and try their balls and pizza. This place is legit contemporary Sicilian homestyle food."}, {"review_id": "8kCyRbBsB2EWBpbD3908PA", "user_id": "Tppsm2sCAAlPFrkt_Bj4ug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "This hole-in-the-wall pizza joint with amazing appetizers and tight seating due to the high demand for their Sicilian pizza is truly a must-try.

Got seated right away and the wait staff was extremely friendly and offered a bunch of suggestions because I'm so indecisive sometimes. After deciding to go with one of the more traditional pizzas on the menu and the sangria I was really impressed with the quality of the food and the house red sangria. I also liked the fact that some of the menu items were named after people or places in the city.

We were going to forgo the appetizer but food networks advertisement of burrata made me get it. The meatballs were good and I'll have to try the burrata again but dang I kept on reaching for the bread that it came with. I knew why everyone gave this place so many stars.

Once we got inside, the service was excellent; our waitress was quick to take our order, and made sure we all had plenty of water. Also, we originally ordered 2 plates of meatballs (3 meatballs on each plate) to split between 6 people, but when 1 more of our friends joined our table, our waitress voluntarily brought out a complimentary meatball so that he wouldn't miss out. Our whole table was very touched by that small gesture. Also, we stayed until 10:30pm, but they in no way tried to rush us out at all. The food was delicious and very filling. We ordered several different flavors of foccacia bread to share. My favorite was the Angie, which was topped with arugula and prosciutto.
