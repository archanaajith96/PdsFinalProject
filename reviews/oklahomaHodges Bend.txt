This is one of those rare bars where it's possible to be productive, while simultaneously relaxing. I love studying with a red in hand. There are a few tables in the front and an outlet, with booths the rest of the way down the place. Those booths don't have outlets--if that's something that matters to you. The WiFi works fine and I've never had trouble connecting or a spotty connection. I recommend their burger; it's enough to split with someone and has a wonderful runny egg inside. It is pure joy and the fries are great too. The mac and cheese is likewise good. Honestly, everything I've tried has been good. I got a rare cocktail the last time I went and I can recommend the Polynesian one for fruity/sweet cocktail lovers. You can't taste the alcohol. All in all, a great place to talk, relax, or even study (shout out to college students everywhere!)."}, {"review_id": "qc2j9gHgYuvSuEJcY_olDw", "user_id": "lNPpc8qufXNyooXHKq1sXQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Great coffee, really great vibe. As others have said, it has a very vintage, old feel in a good way. Love the floor-to-ceiling bar with the record collection in the middle. Seems like a great place to get a drink (whether coffee or alcohol) and get some work done, or meet with friends or clients. This will definitely be a staple for me when I visit Tulsa."}, {"review_id": "inqGdyLcV1MNKPCDdjmnnQ", "user_id": "ARtIt8mfeCL-TJwhIXQbEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Such an inviting space with a warm, Bohemian ambience.

I read about it on a food and wine \"places to eat in Tulsa right now\" blog/article. I am only here in Tulsa for one night (for work), so I really needed to bat .100 on my choice. What a grand slam. This place surprised me from inception- the vibe, design, and decor are like NYC and Austin had a baby bar. Very fun place for meeting a friend, coworker, group, for a date, etc. The cocktails are curious, adventurous, and experimental. I really enjoyed my mezcal cocktails. They also have a nice selection of wine and beer. The food was, besides being masterfully prepared in a food truck outside of the facility, quite stunning. The burger and the shepherds pie--especially the shepherds pie--really stood out. The Mac and cheese was good not great (but spoon me some more pie and fries please). I always like to try new places each time I visit a city, but it's going to be hard to not come back here the next time I'm in town."}, {"review_id": "L_gazLu7tEHTKVTngf0g8Q", "user_id": "-2HBkCef8G6V6W6_eVJtPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "I went to Hodges Bend with some friends to see another friends jazz trio play on a Monday night. The ambience is nice as are the waitstaff. My only complaint is the prices. There really aren't any \"less expensive\" options. I have been here a few times but this will never be a place i frequent.  I'd rather have a couple of glasses of wine than have to nurse one the entire time I'm there.

By day, if you're looking for a cold or hot brew of any variety, a light snack or a place to work that doesn't have the craziness and teenagers of Starbucks, this is a great place to both get work done and meet with people. There's plenty of comfy furniture and booths and tables inside and out to set up shop in and get to work!By night (or happy hour) or even by day if you're that kinda person, this bar has some of the most incredible bartenders in Tulsa. Seriously, even if you think you don't like something, put your trust in their very capable hands and enjoy the result! I've come out of Hodges with a new favorite drink multiple times, and I've also enjoyed things in my cocktail (like egg?!) that I NEVER would have tried some place else.The space is a bit crowded when it gets really hopping at night and there is only street parking, so I wouldn't come here with a huge crowd on a Friday night expecting a lot of space. But if you're a bit more intimate as a group, its a great place to be!"}, {"review_id": "mh_Z488sc3KuKqhzFx7Ubg", "user_id": "ZZiERi-RToZQ-lu4KuE-3g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "First I will say that it took 20 minutes just to get a drink.

I've been here many times for after hrs and the ambience and atmosphere never let me down. The bartenders are definitely more than that. They take pride in their drinks, sorta like art personified to the palate. Great music if you like a little jazz and relaxed atmosphere. The food is also very good. Try a nice panzanella salad or etouffee, both are delish! Don't forget to check Jazz Mondays at 9!!"}, {"review_id": "LyzrlKIf_SkKydVn96mMDQ", "user_id": "WC9Kz1Gw8v9UxvEAJfSeQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/8/2017", "text": "Stopped in for a drink and possibly dessert.

Wait wait before you throw stones at me.  there was no flash, I was not blocking any doors or pathways. I was sitting in my seat the whole time I was taking photos and I was taking photos of my husband. (Yes the interior of the establishment was unavoidable part of the photos) There was no sign that says no photos or pay $20 to take photos. Now I expected to see no photos in the yelp reviews of this place but I see bunch so people are either willing to shell out $20 to take the photos here or we were somehow targeted? I would love it if someone can shed light on it. we did not want to argue with the barista and ruin her evening and ours further. I agree with all the other reviewers about the outstanding ambiance, coffee and cocktails. The vanilla latte I had there was arguably the best and we will probably go back there again if we happen to be in Tulsa downtown.

Hodges Bend had a luxurious but accessible ambiance to it that I absolutely loved. It was bustling on a Friday night, but fortunately my friend snagged us a cozy table in the back. Said cozy table included a great view in front of the bookcase holding what appeared to be a fine collections of tomes and records. Both food and drink were plentiful and delicious. I ordered the Form and Void, a bourbon-based cocktail that was perfect for sipping and savoring. For food, I ordered the mushroom steamed buns as well as having a few tastes of my friends' meatless poutine and mac 'n cheese. Comfort food and cocktails? Yes, please, and thank you.My only complaint was service was a little slow, but that's understandable when it's hustling and bustling.

From morning coffee to drinks at night, it could rightly be called the East Village version of Chimera, but without food and a level up in class.When I'm in Tulsa this is my standard Saturday morning work spot. Environment is a perfect balance between chill and fancy. The seats in the back are quiet enough to make an isolated work environment (my default choice), but there's also always a group of cool people chatting in the front and around the bar. Pick your vibe and hang.Coffee quality: Note that Hodges serves Topeca coffee, which definitely isn't the best. I always find that it's too acidic. Come here for the environment rather than for the quality of the product."}, {"review_id": "1OsMO34HZj0BjuK9f7zSVA", "user_id": "vrAQLKdTaXyfr2xlyJrmGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2017", "text": "Stopped here on the way to the airport and absolutely glad I did.The place has awesome decor and was very inviting like a nice speakeasy.Initially I was just planning on getting an iced coffee but I'm so glad I chose the Irish Coffee instead!It blew me away and was definitely one of the most delicious drinks I've had.I highly recommend this bar and their Irish Coffee!"}, {"review_id": "EoJ_qFDiIA0M0DmhhZPlTw", "user_id": "9jk4X1St6Sdm2uEYeZWKtw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2017", "text": "Hodges is a cool place to grab a drink while waiting on a table to open up at Bohemian.
