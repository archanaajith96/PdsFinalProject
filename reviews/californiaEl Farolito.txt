I recently moved to New York, and you don't know how many times I cried at a Mexican restaurant because it'll just never be the sameeee.....Nothing, absolutely nothing compares to El Farolito unless it's an actual place in Mexico. My boyfriend and I always get the burrito and super quesadilla. The super quesadilla is cooked to perfection here. The carne asada is nicely marinated, extremely juicy and the ingredients is wonderfully simple. They don't put that extra sh*t like LETTUCE....People who put lettuce in my quesadillas I just send it back. Blasphemy! And the quesadilla is nicely toasted, so every bite you get a nice crunch and the richness of the meat, sour cream, salsa, etc. Wonderful spot. And they open late at night. The only thing I suggest to not walk alone late at night to this place. ALSO, cash only."}, {"review_id": "2IFudb7sOGz2_Inc-78-wA", "user_id": "pOLqrWCflFJUwXNCOX_sow", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Just your basic Mexican joint, the tacos are large portions but the burritos lacked meat.I got the regular cabeza burrito with extra guac and I was definitely filled up but it wasn't the most amazing burrito ever.

El Farolito confuses me. It's cash only, dinghy, smells of pee near the entrance, with dirty tables that make you want to take a bath.The food looks delicious, inviting and worthy of the long lines you battle, in this cash only joint.The guacamole was ok, salsa was interesting - they have a free salsa corner for customer. You order your tacos, quesadilla or whatever you fancy with the sides and protein that you crave, and  you get called when it is ready in about 5-10 minutes.Trying to find a table is harder than it looks, however you can get lucky if you throw your jacket while waiting in line - slightly douchy but this food requires you sit down. Overall the food was decent, not the best by any measure, but a taste of the vibrant, chaotic, mesmerizing Mission."}, {"review_id": "Jkw_L52_EgoRdQeHGRZb3g", "user_id": "y-xnIeYdLh0HlPws6_wYgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We came back (not drunk) for more food!I had a Regular Taco with Carne Asada ($2.95) and shared a Suiza (Carne Asada Quesadilla) for $4.75.The taco was delicious! I loved the flavorful chopped meat. It came with 2 flour tortillas, but I think I probably only needed one. I feel like I can easily eat 5 of these. So we totally thought the size of a Suiza was the same with a Super Suiza, but without Sour Cream and Avocado. Wrong! It was not only smaller in size, but the carne asada was not chopped; literally a piece of steak meat in between two tortillas. I did not enjoy this at all. The meat was tough and when I bit into it, the entire piece of meat just pulled out...Also I don't want to sound mean, but the singer in the restaurant was making eating at the restaurant awkward. He came over to our table and pushed his money bag in front of us and wouldn't leave until money was given....ughsAnyway still like this place and will be back for more!"}, {"review_id": "zELZQtOo9izoCtOF2EUniw", "user_id": "s0Q7yyqa8jfsPzw8KbRvUA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I can see why this might be a popular place to check out when drunk, but other than that, it didn't really strike a chord for me. I've definitely had better Mexican food before - especially in LA. The carne asada burrito was a bit too tasteless in my opinion. It was massive (which is nice because you get more bang for your buck); however, I couldn't even finish half and ended up eating my friend's quesadillas instead. The quesadillas were huge and decent tasting, but I think I would've preferred them thinner and crunchier."}, {"review_id": "bpPZqy_hcAepP9Ehqu1Nxw", "user_id": "oULYOe4aDw7Iapzti3Bdjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "They make a breakfast burrito that will blow you away.  If you can deal with longer lines and a dirtier establishment you will be rewarded."}, {"review_id": "JNPv1zD9ehCfqX5JNeBezg", "user_id": "6lS5-2TYITCAL2snIqMx7g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "This place has food that rocks.... the store is crowded, so be patient.

Usually I go to Taqueria Cancún, but when I got there this past Saturday they were closed for construction! So, 4 more blocks down I looked at El Farolito as they were bookmarked as another spot to go to.  Let's just say, your seating here is limited, however people are in and out of this place. We had a group of 5 when we came here and even though it was a long walk from where we came from, everyone was satisfied in the end after tasting the delicious burritos. I ordered the chorizo and carnitas tacos, along with a super Al Pastor burrito. Let's just say I was too confident in hungry I was. I didn't finish the burrito, but got it to go. However, the tacos were absolutely delicious. All the reviews that you have read about this place, it's true. It's great. It's super convenient too as it's right next to a bart station. If you want a great mission burrito, check this place out."}, {"review_id": "QQeI0sI7uV0ki1a1jy6f5g", "user_id": "25sFVhGgZq0pQ-uZRtCKqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "8 years after first stepping into El Farolito and I'm still here!

Went here for some late night drunchies and it totally hit the spot. It was a little past midnight and there was a bit of a line, but nothing too major. I ordered the quesadilla para dos and split it with a friend. Honestly, this thing is monstrous! You might get away with splitting it with 3 people if you're in the sharing mood, lol. If not, just split it with 1 other person as intended. As far as flavor goes, this has to be one of the best, if not the best quesadillas I've ever had! The carne asada was so flavorful, as was the cheese. The fat chunks of avocado were yum as well. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars (I'd give it 4.5) is because I ordered a carnitas super burrito as well, and it fell a little short of expectations. While it was a good carnitas burrito, Guadalajara down the street's carnitas burrito blows it out the water. But, I hear the carne asada burrito here it to die for, so I'll try it in the future and adjust my rating accordingly, lol."}, {"review_id": "jnJeoAWU0utusDyro1xJ4Q", "user_id": "S6TGSH7fmxP_dPzeueeGlQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "(Cash is king here)Big line always, but definitely worth the wait to get decent Mexican in San Francisco.

My friends enjoyed the Quesadilla Super Suiza, Super Buritto Carne Asada, and Carne Asada Torta. There compliments consisted of \"this food is beautiful\" \"I'm stuffed but I'll order another one right now\"\"the salsa, something about the salsa is doing it for me\"\"this is fire\"If those comments don't make you walk over to El Farolito right now, I'm not sure you can be trusted.

It's not a fancy or anything, but it really hits the craving, especially after a night out. The salsas are excellently made, and nice and spicy, and my friend got some tacos that looked great as well.They are cash only I believe, but I guess that's just part of being in the Mission."}, {"review_id": "mLvrpt-h9JDO1_gZCLjFEg", "user_id": "ZEeUr17mIuhuwDuWYNEu0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Solid, darn near amazing Mexican food.

I had the carne asada super burrito with no tortilla and my husband had the super chile relleno burrito. Both were amazing! Truly, thru far exceeded our expectations. Then as we were leaving and taking pictures with ominous ATM out front, the security guard comes over and says \"Hey are you guys into sports?\" We replied \"Yeah, we were mad we missed the Celtics game today! No where to watch it!\" (Side note: Heck no I'm not paying for cable! We've got that fabulous antenna on 3 smart televisions and Wi-Fi in the house, I'm good!\")So,  Mr. Security Guard pulls us inside the Farollito Bar next door which is equipped with 3 big screens with all the basketball games plaguing!
