Tim was super knowledgeable about everything that was offered, between the flavors, the sauces and even the SOJU! He was extremely personable and really helpful to us BBQ newbies. We shared the beef bulgogi, beef short ribs, seafood soup with udon and the clam soup with ramen. First, the flavor of the marinated beef short ribs is definitely the reason to come back. Bulgogi was good too, but I'm a short rib kind of girl. The soup! YOU HAVE TO ORDER THE SOUP. It's perfectly seasoned and has the right amount of spice to it. The noodles were also great. I prefer the ramen over the udon. Kind of wish there was an egg in it. Definitely a must try!"}, {"review_id": "De6CAGxRMuCX9JsTUstn4g", "user_id": "u3PCaHsDW-f2nDGwU4-bKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "I was not aware that this place was a small chain. My wife and I previously had the So Gong Dong in Duluth so my expectations coming in here were pretty low. My wife, kids, and I came in while visiting family in Montgomery. We had a party of 10 but we were seated immediately I assume because it was a Wednesday. The place is situated in a pretty large strip mall so parking was an ease. I had the dumpling tofu soup and my wife had the seafood tofu soup. We also had a side of the Korean ribs. The sides were plentiful and our server made sure that they were refilled promptly. I can honestly say the tofu soup here is some of the best I've ever had. There were not stingy with the number of dumplings in the soup and the heat of the hot was enough to make me perspire just a little bit. We all left thoroughly satisfied."}, {"review_id": "50bEpAGvlEanGuC2xjDhSg", "user_id": "LwWIDgHpKWhPpgll32T3_Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "3.5 stars.I've eaten here multiple times, and I remember when it was still Arirang. I get the tofu noodle soup with pork every time, which is a huge bowl with the most tofu I've ever seen in a dish. I always get mildly spicy. The water they serve here has a tinge of sesame in it, which I used to hate until I ate something spicy. They go pleasantly together. I had to dock a star for the short rib. I just wasn't impressed! It seemed to lack usual flavor."}, {"review_id": "-Zs5TrOMUMn9Th055ho1xA", "user_id": "fcLlY2UX-pctau-RNwEBxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "This is our favorite Korean restaurant in Montgomery!

The people were very pleasant and the gentleman tried working with me on something to eat. Ended up going with the tofu kimchi soup.  While I was waiting on the food, he bought out some water for me and asked me to have a seat. Small thing but a great touch.I was very pleasantly surprised to get to the hotel room and find three orders of banchan in my meal!!  Bonus and super tasty. The kimchi soup was crazy good, with a good level heat and some savory spices. It was served with a decent size order of noodles.  My only ding is that for takeout orders, they should put a little oil on the noodles as they were all clumped together.Great food, nice people, excellent service."}, {"review_id": "uhDQqAEM_HrQ9An68NWQ7A", "user_id": "vy0ULfIT0WPe8bw6lmSBHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "We came to Montgomery for a business trip.  It was after 9pm and decided to grab a quick bite.  We have only had Korean once and wanted to try it again.  Holy Moly!  Not disappointed at all!!  The Beef Bibimbap with the Fried Dumplings was healthy and flavorful!   Fell in LOVE with the Spicy Korean Sauce!  We will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "sfH6CY5KNMoVQpe43jAUHQ", "user_id": "m-IZMSO_Y-tG9PLJE18Plg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "Food was delicious. We called to make a lunch reservation in case they were packed and they were very accommodating. There was kind of a language barrier with the servers, so it would've been nice if they explained the 'service call button' to us as there were a couple of times we wanted more Ban Chan (small appetizers).We were immediately served the cold barely water and it caught me off guard every time I took a sip because I was anticipating water. It also took a while to get a to-go container after we had asked for them...I had the beef bulgogi and tried my friends chicken bulgogi and the short ribs. Everything was delicious! I especially liked the pickled cucumber Ban Chan, wish I could've taken some home with me.

The first time I came here I didn't realize they had regular drinks you could order. I thought it was just the barley water or beer lol. That was definitely a communication fail on both me and my server. But the food is always good and sometimes they give you different types of kimchi and sides. Next time I go I need to see if they have more of their potato salad. It was very good. I've had their tofu noodle soup which is great, but right now I'm in love with their clay pot/plate dishes. They give you a lot of food for your money and I usually have some to take home with me.

I'll be honest I didn't have high hopes for Korean food in Alabama. But, I was unaware of there being a very large Korean population due to the proximity of the Hyundai and Kia manufacturing plants. Now for the food. I ordered pork bulgogi and steamed dumplings. The dumplings were cooked just right with the dough being soft but not mushy and the filling still moist on the inside. I've had better dipping sauces with dumplings but these were good enough without it in my opinion. The pork bulgogi was served pin a hot stone sizzle plate, and came out steaming hot. The flavor and texture of the meat were excellent, I would have preferred more spice but for those not used to the spiciness of Korean food it should be plenty spicy. The sides were good, with some kimchi (not too sour like at the end of winter), cucumber kimchi (a little sweet), bean sprouts, and a type of picked diakon I haven't had before. All in all my meal was excellent and if I'm ever back in Montgomery I'll be eating here again."}, {"review_id": "n1jej7i2f3XCOd55TEWFxA", "user_id": "C9SwWN9fb0l_qV-rFO74qg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "My prayers had been answered and i found the place for Korean soul-food!
