I used to go nuts over the decor. The food always good... Now that I'm older, I have mixed feelings. The last two times I came here, I had horrible waitress'. They were more worried about how they looked and flirting with, well every male in the place. I know a woman comenting on another woman flirting. Shame shame. But it was my 9 year old daughter that caught the waitress' behavour. Than of course the rest of us caught on. It was obvious that she didn't want to wait on a table with kids. But I remember being a kid and the waiters being excellent. So what happened? Is it just a generation thing?...

The eggplant was perfectly cooked and rolled in their ricotta cheese and baked with Mozz on top. The red sauce tastes like your Italian grandmothers Sunday gravy. The arancini were just as great as I remember them being when I visited Rome a few years ago. Deep fried rice balls filled with peas and cheese... how can you go wrong?The salad to share could be shared between 4 people so BEWARE if you aren't that hungry. The dressing is a traditional homemade Italian, and good news...they sell it right there in the restaurant! Lastly, the margarita pizza is perfectly thin and crispy. The tomatoes are fresh, the cheese is delicious and the spices bring it together.

The restaurant is always busy and packed so I highly suggest that you either get here early or are in no rush to go anywhere. The atmosphere is wonderful and the wait staff are excellent.

It was definitely packed at lunch time and clearly a popular location. My friend recommended it because it's a favorite amongst the locals. So we stopped in and wow. The place is pretty big inside and has a side room area that houses a full bar and plenty of tables too. The servers were super friendly and quite frankly all staff were helpful and had great personalities. The food came out fairly quick despite the crowd. The salad was great and we ordered a small pizza, which I would say most might equate it to a medium or large at other pizza locations. It was amazing. The crust was perfect and the toppings were a plenty.

But it was good pizza. The restaurant itself is huge. Almost a block's worth of space, but still, strolling in at 6 on Saturday, there was already a wait. We did find a couple of seats at the bar, though, and ordered right away. The place has a neighborhood restaurant feel. It's warm, comfortable, the staff knows the regulars, and they serve sliced bread with butter pats before your meal. The bathrooms in the bar are quite fancy. The hand dryers are built right into the sinks. (keep this in mind if you find yourself wandering around, looking for a place to dry your hands.)The pizza was good, but I've been spoiled with amazing pizza. We also ordered the calamari which was good, but not great. If you're in Springfield, this might be your best bet. If I find myself there again, I will likely go back. But I wouldn't list this in my top 10 pizza places. Maybe closer to 13."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/redrose-springfield?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
