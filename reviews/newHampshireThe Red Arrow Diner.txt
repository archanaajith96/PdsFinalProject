Their burgers are solid. Red Arrow offers their own signature burger and a few others, but it's a ton more fun to opt for their highly customizable burger bar instead! You can start off with fresh ground beef or choose an alternative such as turkey, veggie (vegan-friendly red quinoa) or chicken-fried steak burger. Toppings are sorted by price point and cover everything from the usual accoutrements to crab cakes and fried mac & cheese. I'm not sure if the buns are Red Arrow are made in house or purchased from elsewhere, but they were damn good.-Cakes slices are comically large here and I certainly got my money's worth. My carrot cake lasted 3 days lol. It was also a bit dense, but I still enjoyed it. The frosting almost tasted like marshmallow so that was different."}, {"review_id": "x3rRtnpDeUazHnzQRshN1A", "user_id": "9ZmuiqO2bqKrQdIA8XP2pw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Really wanted to love it. I am a big fan of diners and local businesses. Wait was great, chicken and rice soup was a meal unto itself. Having just had a breakfast the night before at a Lowell diner we were both didn't want breakfast, this might have been a mistake on out part as the breakfasts looked great. Anyway I ordered open faced turkey sandwich w mashed and my honey got the turkey club. The turkey was Soo dry. We are talking Christmas vacation turkey dry. My bf ordered extra mayo and made his into a BLT and I ate a lot of potatoes. When the waitress came by to ask if we wanted anything else and how the meal was we mentioned the dryness. She asked for the sandwich which turkey meat we ordered.as if we were given a choice. BF said however it came we weren't offered various cuts. Mine had different types of meat and was only marginally better. Disappointed in the lack of any offer to come back again etc."}, {"review_id": "bjQPiHongGJGbFpaH4GE5g", "user_id": "VUSuNGNEUmf7Jn04d4qYaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "This is definitely one of those old, nastlgic small town diners. It's tiny. There are 4 booths and a row or stools at a long counter. There were groups that came in but left due to lack of seating. The place was packed at 1AM on a Monday night. But the service was fast, the people nice and the food was good.I ordered the Crabcake Benny, with pan fries. It was really good. I tried to finish it all off, but there was no way with all the food. If you like smaller portions you could make it into 2 separate meals or split it and be just fine."}, {"review_id": "uF1cwHq7gY_P5_vshvf8Og", "user_id": "z1z8fZ-NS1uomgoRkuFOpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Came here on a recommendation from a co worker and I'm glad we did.

How hard is it to season your hamburgers and ask your employees to put smiles on their faces! Note to customers I saw the waitstaff taking napkins and just wiping off counters no sanitary spray was used there was nothing used to clean the counter from the prior customer and the utensils were placed on a dry napkin in front of you but the counter was still dirty from whoever sat there before you and whoever coughed on it."}, {"review_id": "GVLVBlSAQ6YlbYga5vec2w", "user_id": "ZrtbSd1O-XaGc86xZ9Ni9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "Diner delight!  If diners are your thing, this place will do it perfectly. Cute, cozy, and yummy. Come hungry as the portions are large. We had chicken parm, stuffed peppers with homemade beans, and a Philly cheesesteak omelet for lunch. With chocolate brownie cream pie and Moe's mocha frozen coffee for dessert. Everything was top notch and seriously tasty. Left overs came home with us. What pushed this to five stars is the friendly, fast service. And the pie. We need more true diners all over the place.

I always get the Queen Dinah which is pretty much 2 of everything for breakfast. Prices are right but the food is a step above what most diners serve in my opinion. Parking is tough. Can get crowded durring popular breakfast hours and on weekends but well worth it. They have pretty much everything on the menu from liver and onions to chicken parmesan. They also have some really good pies you can order by the slice or pie to go. Plus you also run the chance of running into Adam Sandler when dining here !"}, {"review_id": "K-LSWxQru48rU-yg6mIJQA", "user_id": "LlCH__Y4Z5--APow89Tu5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/1/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We stopped at the Red Arrow Diner on our way in from the airport.  It is always a treat to see this iconic diner.  This is their flagship location - everyone in the know comes here.  We were warmly greeted by Ellen.  It is easy to see why this place is crowded all the time.  The service and food is top notch.  The menu is quite extensive and reasonably priced.  I enjoyed the corned beef hash with two eggs with wheat toast.  My husband went for the \"Stan the Man's Favorite - two eggs, bacon, and rye toast.

Absolutely wonderful food, I don't think I've been disappointed by the food once out of the 20+ times I've been. Only once was I disappointed by the service, and to be honest we were in a bad state ourselves and didn't have the morale to cook our own food, so maybe it was just translated into being massively confusing for the waitress. It happens. My boyfriend used to go there more frequently just for a few cups of coffee and a chat with the waitresses. They really do know and love their regulars.Since we left, we've been trying to find an emotional replacement and have yet to do so. Note on crowds: Yeah, this place is popular and tiny (compared to todays mega-restaurants, anyway). That's part of the charm. If you go at 10am on a Tuesday, you can probably get seated right away. If you go for Sunday brunch, or late at night when the bars are emptying out, it's gonna be crazy. Just like any other restaurant. And if you wanna sit at the bar, prepare to cozy up and get to know your neighbors :)Oh, also to get to the bathroom you have to go through the kitchen. I only went once because of this. The cooks get a kick out of it and will say hello, but it's kind of stressful."}, {"review_id": "7sjECWVvWAYgk300DjIrpg", "user_id": "_NDbY_dIVHSnuXEycvfT3Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Stopped by at almost 2 AM , And it was actually pretty full.
