I went for many wing nights in my day and it's always a great space to stop in for a good beer from their giant beer list.My go-to sandwich has always been the McMinns Chicken Dance. Spicy chicken, an egg, lettuce, mayo, on a bun - with their signature chips... so. good. I always get this when I'm doing take-out, and frequently still get it when I'm in the restaurant. The salads, known as head-wiches are full salads! Friends tend to love these as you can get everything possible in a salad there! The potato skins are a great appetizer, and the burgers seem to be favorites of friends too!They've recently renovated with a great outdoor space and updated bar area. They also have their beer to-go and souvenirs in the upstairs loft area."}, {"review_id": "ZrkAZIoxh1yV2gH_pkZ_yQ", "user_id": "dRk7Hhos49RIdf7WWjrZ9g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "I think the best way to describe this place is bar food, elevated. They feature a massive amount of options, wings, burgers, headwiches (a sandwich the size of your head), salads and awesome starters. I tried the cheesy bacon fries, spicy parm traditional wings, and Reneè's red hot and blue burger. Diet starts tomorrow. All so good. The French fries have a delicious seasoning on them and the portions were great.Fat Heads is known for their beer after all. They offer a long list of seasonal and year round brews that you can order in flights or by the glass. The Fat Heads hop juju and Hefeweizen were so tasty. If you love variety you will love fat heads. The menu and beer list are diverse enough to satisfy just about everyone and with most entrees priced under 12.50, it won't break the bank."}, {"review_id": "gNwwvTcFRW3C139zewpFeQ", "user_id": "RVagGrcHdy1HB7-_c9ywZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Shoutout to the bartender who sat with me while my drunk ass loudly brainstormed whether Fat Heads was a Cleveland brewery or a Pittsburgh one. We ultimately decided that the beer is from Cleveland, but the food is from Pittsburgh. Whether we're right or wrong doesn't matter. We used our intellect and teamwork to arrive at our well thought conclusion, and I refuse to hear any other theories or ideas about it.Now that we have that settled, I'm sure you want to know about the food and drink. Consensus: it is gooooood. My friend and I ordered some much needed apps. We had frickles (fried pickles), shrooms, bacon and cheddar fries, and the original smoked wings. Sriracha thousand island and horseradish accompanied the fried veggies, which was unexpected and a delicious touch. I am the sauce queen, so you can take my opinion as canon. The fries were cooked well, but the cheddar cheese sauce tasted like lukewarm cheese whiz. It's kind of like they decided to play Philly with the fries. Someone's thought process had to have been \"Okay, we hate Philadelphia. We're the better Penn city. How do we show it? Ooh, I know! Let's take one of their star food items, make it gross, and toss it on one of America's greatest foods!\" That's totally fine and a Pittsburgh type of thing to do, but you could warn a girl first ya know? But okay, move over fry-wreck, I need to talk about wings. MMM wings. I may be considered the sauce queen, but I can appreciate a properly cooked smoked wing. You don't sauce a dry wing. That would be an abomination on both my sauceland and the domain of my ally, the smoker. Luckily Fat Head's is aware, and gives you the option of order extra dry rub on your smoky deliciousness. No sauce here buddy! These wings are huge; they are the full wing, after all. We ordered a 5 piece, and considering the other apps we had, were very pleased with our choice. Had we ordered more we would have left a lot of food on the table. I don't know about you, but I hate wasting good food. The beer is as varied and plentiful as you can imagine. Fat Head's is an excellent brewery, but the saloon makes the smart decision of offering other Pennsylvania crafts so you have to attempt to make an educated decision. Then again, in my head, there's no such thing as a bad beer, but there are some beers that I absolutely adore and some that I'll drink because it's given to me. (I'm looking at you, Bud Lite.) My friend had the Blueberry Ale, which is one of their more famous beers. I'm not a fruity beer drinker, so I went for their Shakedown stout. At 8.6%, this was not a good follow up to all the high ABV stouts I had earlier, but I like to keep some things in the family, ya feel?Fat Heads is a great option on the South Side, and if you've never visited before, you'll find yourself have a lot of places to choose from. Just do me a favor, and make time to stop in for a fat pint."}, {"review_id": "NEzVpvy4BnJz7A6DOQs8Xg", "user_id": "UsmTxWbobLsI6WR1Db0W7A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "When you travel you always EWTLE (eat where the locals eat!) Definitely the sandwich shop locals flock to! Huge headwiches (sandwiches the size of your head) and great beer selection. Bumble berry IPA is a local favorite! The menu is loaded with burgers, sandwiches, sides and wings. I had the Cuban which was a take on the great South Florida treat. Slightly different, it doesn't replace the classic but not bad if you're in need of a fix. Why three stars? Parking and location. Carson Street is the biggest PIA and so is the South Side.

They don't have as many vegetarian options as if like, but they have a \"made in house\" black bean patty that you can substitute on any burger. I ordered takeout and got their jalepeno bacon burger with a veggie patty & no bacon. (Woman on the phone said that was from an old menu, but they made it happen anyway). I was pleased that they went off the menu for my order, and it was delicious. The sandwich was pretty spicy, but goat cheese really balanced out the heat. I also enjoy their buffalo cauliflower. Can't go wrong with that! This isn't the place for a light meal, so if you're looking to fall into a good coma, and have a nice beer selection, this is the place to go."}, {"review_id": "uy4aAfhTPDyoWtUxB9Jycg", "user_id": "ZwzQ4ebnyQKEEifUL66vwg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/6/2017", "text": "First time visiting Pittsburgh and luckily was with a local.

The mix of brisket and pastrami is perfect. AND THE GARLIC PARM MAYOO! Man was that so good! The hot pepper kraut really added a nice bit of spice and crunch too. Pro tip: get a side of ranch to dip your chips in! Beer wise, they have so many on tap that if you can't find something you like, the problem is you. I almost always get one of their beers because #drinklocal.Just some housekeeping things: there's a lot across the street and street parking all along Carson St. they recently remodeled the place and the downstairs didn't seem to have as much seating as before.

I'm giving this a four star review because my Pittsburgh salad came out with no french fries and that's a pretty big faux pas. To be fair they did bring me out a side of super fresh really delicious french fries that I've been ate with ranch dressing, so not all was lost. The wings here are super good, as is the brisket salad-they smoke their meeting house and they certainly do a good job. The sandwiches are just incredibly huge, totally splittable, actually everything on the menu is totally splittable unless you're in the mood for a serious eating experience quantity wise.Are usually go for lunch just because going to the southside any evening during the week is a circus.

For some reason they decided to cover 75% of the restaurant and bar in subway tile. Doesn't exactly scream \"Fat Head's\" to me, but oh well.The star here to me is, and ways will be, the beer. I definitely don't come here to try another brewery, and stick to Fat Head's beer every time. The top choice being Hop JuJu when it's available, but I've rarely had a FH brew I didn't enjoy.For the food, it's top of the notch bar food. I know some people enjoy huge portions, but can't say I do. However, I've adjusted my ordering here to accommodate. Personal favorites are the fried pickles which arrive in a basket with 2 sauces and basically 5lbs of pickles. And for the entree, smoked original wings, every time.Now my MAJOR gripe: I hate nowait, I hate that Fat Head's uses it. We showed up right at the exact time listed with 1 table ahead of us, but when we checked in we were told we still have to wait. Why was that an issue? Half of the patio and restaurant were empty.

We both decided on burgers. I ordered the smoky burger and she ordered the gluten free triple bypass burger (and substituted the beasty BBQ sauce for the smoky BBQ sauce). Both burgers were juicy and flavorful, and the fries they were served with were solid. We were both pleasantly surprised by the gluten free bun. The portions were very generous. We couldn't finish and had to take the remains to go. Our waitress was friendly and the service wasn't too slow.I'd definitely go back, but I'd probably have to prepare my stomach ahead of time.
