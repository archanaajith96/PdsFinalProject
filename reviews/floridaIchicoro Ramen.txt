Good music bumping from the good sound system. First time I've seen brothless ramen on a menu. I got the Tonkotsu ramen which containedpork broth, chasyu asado, menma, scallion, ajitama, mayu, beni shoga. Tasted so good. I was satisfied with how the combination of ingredients went well together and balanced so perfectly. This was a great meal for the late night I worked. They have a good selection of rice bowls as well. Also the extras are on point, they have grilled pork belly, citrus grilled shrimp, applewood smoked, seasoned and poached eggs, bamboo shoots, toasted seaweed and two types of spicy sauces My friends had the Brothless ramen and they said it was okay.

It's a hipster hangout for sure (guys, aggressive hip hop at loud volume isn't always the best choice of music. Try some variety), but the food is superior. I would say their largest flaw is that sometimes they let the broth simmer down too far and it can get very salty, but that's rarely an issue. They char the pork belly a bit before placing it in the soup, which is indicative of those little extra steps that make it a cut above. They have tasty but notably overpriced cocktails, and nice specials that definitely keep the ramen-head coming back for more. Finally, I can scratch that ramen itch when I'm not out of town."}, {"review_id": "pNuP2XmybYTJ6Rxqe6e35w", "user_id": "nWRDqA-XXdju1jOMnN7QcA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "The TONKOTSU ($15.50) 4/5 is made with pork broth, lots of pickled bamboo shoots and half of a seasoned egg (what happened to the other half and where'd it disappear to...not into my stomach!?), which were my favorite and tucked underneath heaping pile of ramen and not soggy or over cooked. I would've loved a bigger piece of pork belly and for an extra $2 ordered a poached egg (Bland & boring, hit the snooze on this and skip it next go!).TSUKEMONO ($5) 4/5: Fermented cucumbers with crunchy vinergery dikoin radish, a nice starter and snack.CARDIA ISLANDS ($10) 4/5: Ginger is one of my weaknesses and luckily for me, this Hibiscus Sake cocktail had a nice amount of it, good tasting where it left sweet tastes and wonderfully stroong alcohol wise! ATMOSPHERE 3/5: The music was rather odd for an Asian establishment with hip/hop music beating loudly and is my jam, but didn't feel right in this seating. I felt the space was crammed tightly with many tables with little room and lacked chi or an overall balance.The portions are on the smaller side, more than I'd want to pay as Susan and Boon noted. Yes, I'd come back since the food is tasty, but not often and be prepared to spend $16 - $20 for bowl of ramen if you add additional toppings to it (You've been warned!)!"}, {"review_id": "lG5mUa3L3TE-MnAQBffnZg", "user_id": "ez_0ZOmof9vuacg0qZy8qA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "This is gonna be a short review lolAfter watching a great musical at the Straz I was totally starving!

What we liked: The broth wasn't too oily or heavy and was seasoned well. The noodles were perfectly al dente and the soft-boiled egg was tasty and complemented the rest of the bowl. What we didn't like: The pork belly was really thick so it got over cooked and dry. There were also bits of minced pork in the broth which I assume was to enhance the flavor but it actually strayed from the authenticity of a traditional ramen bowl. It lacked some of the \"basic\" add ons like chopped garlic and chili oil. We had to ask for those items and were charged a $1 each at the end. Which, had they told us earlier, we would not have gotten. But aside from the service, what's most important is the ramen, which we liked. I'll definitely come back to try the shoyu ramen."}, {"review_id": "606Nlifcn53F6vQtROC05g", "user_id": "d80M4k8plKu5WVrJh6osAg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "This place has good ramen but booya in st Pete wins the blind taste test. They always have wait time unless you pick very least popular times. The atmosphere is pretty hip and has a cool vibe to it.Again parking is tight even with the extra parking lot next door. Our table ordered the mushroom ramen, spicy kumuchi and tsukemono. The food was good but not that great. The broth for spicy kumuchi had this overwhelming pork taste to it. The mushroom ramen was the better one here but again it wasn't like super delicious or anything. The appetizer was actually my favorite among all three."}, {"review_id": "0GYsFoonHx0bMhZIMWBVRg", "user_id": "8Nd-oRuDp_4U5vwd715iCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Wow what a treat! My sister and I wanted to try something new and loved the flavors in what we got. I almost had ramen envy when she let me bite one of the mushrooms in her ramen--which was delicious and a bit sweet--but my tonkotsu was off the chain!!! The broth was nice and thick with tons of flavor and my seasoned egg was probably the highlight for me. With add-ons, the meal can get pricey but it's worth it for a treat! Can't wait to come back again! One thing that is a bit annoying for women is that there are no hooks under the short tables for purses, but what can ya do."}, {"review_id": "sdSdiFFJSriR-0mavP_cvw", "user_id": "mGiUnXUc9iX_WAha4I5QNQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "What draws me into Ichicoro is the atmosphere, but I can't say the same about the ramen.Expect a price range between $14-16 for a bowl of ramen because, sorry to break it to ya, these aren't Cup Noodles. Despite the four times that I have been here, the ramen has not been more than average for me. The Shoyu and Tonkotsu broths are too salty compared to other ramen that I have had) and the meat quantity that you get in ratio to the noodles are not worth what you're paying for. However, others that I have gone there with said otherwise so have a try if you're that curious.Located on Seminole Heights, the restaurant fits into its own little nook. With very little parking right in front of the building, you have to opt for street parking. As you walk in, you have access to the full bar which has decently priced cocktails and a special Kirin Ichiban foam machine. The actual dining area itself is small with an open kitchen view. If you've been to Ippudo NY (a popular ramen shop in the City), you'll notice that the greeting before you are seated and the atmosphere is​ similar. Dinner time may not be the most ideal time for quiet talkers as it gets pretty loud.To conclude, I tend to recommend this place to my out-of-town friends and family because I always hope that to have a better experience. However, for me personally, I have not seen much of a change that could make me give this place four stars."}, {"review_id": "BlqfNCNQGxb3p1Q25ftF7A", "user_id": "G9P3h7ZGdbdc_Zt6IKC2vQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "This ramen was pretty good. The broth was a little saltier than I like, but everything complimented each other well (I got the \"popular\" ramen - the servers will know if you ask). We are limited in ramen in the Tampa Bay Area, but I lived in NYC & travel a lot, so ramen is hard to win me over.  Maybe it's almost unfair to write this review....The music is awkwardly loud. Even with someone right across from me, on a 2 top table, we had difficulty speaking. Sake based drink list for the alcohol drinkers.

Dinner menu just offers a few more things, for instance I notice more things under snack menu and 3 more choices of ramen. I got karaage to share with my hubby, which is bite-sized fried chicken with some delicious spicy garlic sauce, and tonkotsu ramen with extra toppings added like poached egg and nori (toasted seaweed) with spicy sauce 1 (jalapeno yuzu kosho) on the side. I liked everything except the grilled pork belly. I wasn't a fan of pork belly being so dry. I thought the spicy sauce 1 had a nice balance between jalapeno and yuzu kosho. It wasn't exactly spicy but a hint of citrus flavors from yuzu and jalapeno added more flavor to soup. It's always busy and crowded here, but the service is pretty quick once you get a table. I would definitely come back!Tip: here's one rookie mistake I've made. I tried to add extra toppings based on what wasn't listed on tonkotsu ramen I got. The description sounded like I wasn't going to get an egg and nori in my ramen, so I added those to my toppings, but of course every ramen bowl will come with a seasoned egg and nori..oopsie! So get it only if you want extra. Lastly, the spicy sauce comes plenty to share between people, so just order one."}, {"review_id": "CxLxAG0qd8LVXlzncup59Q", "user_id": "4BOIofr9AqGSGoyTLTgoJA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Overall a solid ramen joint. A bit of wait for dinner and parking was limited but you can park along the street nearby the restaurant. The music was loud so everyone was talking pretty loud and the tables are really close in proximity. So not a place for a quiet intimate date. More like a friend gathering type place. Both broths were savory and really good but lacked the x factor to make it a 5 star. The fried chicken was also good but on the heavy side and salty. Service was adequate. In the end, it hit the spot and we will likely be back next time we are in Tampa."}, {"review_id": "3F1JZTYmEdg-0fvbcUlE-A", "user_id": "XzFjXsPjn1Y5_WLZ0HFCWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "I can't believe I haven't reviewed this location because it's been a while since I been hooked!

Do not skip the appetizers they are all yummy, the shredded steamed bun and the  friend chicken  karagee  are my go to apps.

He had a rumble in his belly, a pep in his step and a determination to fill this abyss.He traveled far and wide to the land of Seminole Heights where he found a hidden gem. At first glance this gem appears to be a car garage turned contemporary hipster meets dapper gentlemen (think GOT Brienne of Tarth meets Ellen Page in building form)Upon his arrival he was met with Spicy Kimuchi ramen, karaage (Fried chicken), and \"Ropa Vieja\" (shredded beef) style steamed buns. This hipster, joint in shining armor served the most appetizing, eye rolling, toe curling ramen. A must try. The Karagge isn't your run of the mill fried chicken. Try it.

The portion size for the ramen was about average. I did end up ordering a poached egg and extra pork. The broth was creamy and not overly salty.

I love the original bowl so this was great to have, but it wasn't the best I've had.The second time I came was around 6 PM and we had a party of 4.
