The sausage pastry was good, but the tomato basil soup blew it out of the water! Rich and creamy and herb-y, this soup was perfect. I'm not always a \"soup person,\" but I ate every bit of it. The caramel cookie waffles were just as good as all the reviewers say -- just the right amount of sweet with a thick layer of gooey caramel on the inside.This place is popular! The line was long, the seating area was a bit crowded - but ordering was quick and everyone who wanted a seat, got one, it seemed."}, {"review_id": "TtfZJDwKOhvY_t752GV5ag", "user_id": "NZP66j_6UEZ46Q0HUov7yw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/22/2017", "text": "I and my uncle stopped here from out of town and we fell completely in love with this place and the people. The food was absolutely excellent and the customer service was the best we have ever had!The tall bearded cute chef guy in the back had this strong silent type vibe going for him and omg he is so cute and can really cook. We will definitely be coming back. The food is really fresh and it appears that everything is made in house, nothing tastes artificial or frozen. The price is great, the seating area feels like something in a movie and the people that work there are just awesome, kind and considerate. We watched as a few of the workers helped older folks from their car that's too awesome.  Cannot wait to come back and enjoy this remarkable experience again!"}, {"review_id": "m3_WX5p0d6cWjAIYXgsIxg", "user_id": "BdAB1yosGmxU6IwV37sPmw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/19/2016", "text": "Great deli.

Service was very friendly. The owner was delightful and very helpful. Although I wanted to open a package and consume them right then and there, I refrained and packaged them neatly in my luggage. Once I got home, though, all bets were off. Beware: They are addictive. I ate two cookies before I knew it, and then told myself I could eat half of one more. Then I ate the whole thing. I don't even regret it."}, {"review_id": "oNqdXO90FYjlbMDnqBr5dg", "user_id": "fkBStErrrRS5fD-8zWmH_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2017", "text": "A lot of people don't know that this place makes the BEST carrot cake in town.They're known for their signature Carmel waffle cookies which are addictive (and I don't even like Carmel or cookies) but if you want to impress, buy their carrot cake.I haven't had their other baked goods or eaten here but I would come again."}, {"review_id": "0aQFj0-RS5PxwMBJXGXz1A", "user_id": "-97V2Vl0Hn8kmFoSgeksEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "This is NOT a breakfast spot this review is for their baked goods only. I came to try their breakfast because of the 5 star rating and they were under a breakfast category. Upon arriving I quickly realized they had a very small selection of breakfast items and what I had, the special I think, which consisted of a bagel \"steamed\" eggs and melted cheese was not what I was expecting to eat for breakfast that morning. Due to our limited time we decided to stay however our breakfast came with a cinnamon roll and it was delicious. Decided to try other pastries and was surprised at how tasty their pastries were. Took some to go and had a fantastic brunch with what we purchased. Again do not go for their breakfast stick to the pastries. I had the S'mores cappuccino which was delicious. Did not have a opportunity to sample their sandwiches but they had options."}, {"review_id": "g91lkVsr7Xe3Er3CEm_fHg", "user_id": "cHqvt0EpftND8X-4nO1ERw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/2/2017", "text": "If you're from Billings you know.

People around Billings always talked about \"caramel waffle cookies\" I just HAD to try.  When I saw that it was a stroopwafel (that is what we Dutch call them), my heart skipped a beat! They are delicious caramel goodness, that go great with a cup of coffee.  This family-owned bakery has been around for over 30 years, serving up excellent traditional Dutch-baked goodies like their Dutch pastry of flaky, buttery crust surrounding a spiced sausage roll (saucijzenbroodje), a mix of pies and cookies, and lunch specials like soups and salads.  They also sell imported Dutch pantry items (of which I may have cleaned them out of), and traditional gouda.  This place is always busy, but the line moves quickly!"}, {"review_id": "wUUr5WcwnttmwrHW4OSalg", "user_id": "iDbhVDSUqkl_MIh3k62Eqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2016", "text": "This is where the excellent stroopwafels you see on gas station counters all over this area of Montana are made.If is also an awesome, unpretentious, neighborhood restaurant with simple yet delicious soups, sandwiches, and pastries.
