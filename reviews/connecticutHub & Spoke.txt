Friendly staff with a great atmosphere, food and drinks. Favorites were the brussel Ssrouts (Lou's way), the flat iron steak and the buratta. The brownie sundae and banana cream pie were delicious. And the Scotch/Whiskey choices and prices were fantastic. With so much to choose from, we'll definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "oEek-2-lgi219QwHyIQApQ", "user_id": "iVw9RmKzlfgOnBlOwwVrzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "(I'm just the stenographer for this one, but agree with everything as written).Mr. H: A little slow on the mixed drinks but they handled Easter very well. The mimosas were so heavy on the champagne that after two I hope **** shares the driving back to Boston. The new shrimp and grits were a standout - they didn't hold back on the Louisiana flavor. The cold salmon wasn't that crappy grocery story variety and the oysters were plump and disappeared real fast; btw did you know you took the last one, Sue? I wish I had that recipe for bread pudding. Maybe it's on their webpage. The servers were all really hustling, and it's good they included a gratuity because a lot of people don't tip for a buffet.Did you see how the kids were making statutes out of the dessert chocolates? We finally found a brunch where they ate enough to cover whatever it cost to feed them.D**n we forgot to make a reservation for Mother's Day. Would you mind calling them, Sue?"}, {"review_id": "K2mQXN08lr_1yyLKeoyNfg", "user_id": "fiZzdD7UbIRz190KtAhgGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "This seems like an all around good spot.

We went for a late lunch on a Saturday and the place was not busy at all. We were immediately seated and given menus. The restaurant has a nice bar area, dining area and a larger room for bigger parties. The decor was bright and pleasing. The waitress was especially helpful in explaining their menu and offerings. I settled on a beef brisket sandwich and my girlfriend had the Spanish Chorizo Board. The chorizo came with some cornbread which was delicious, the chorizo had a very nice bite to it as well. Very good and filling. The beef brisket sandwich was very tender and juicy, it was the perfect size. Overall we had a great time at this place and will definitely go back. At the table they had an advertisement for their brunch which also looked good. Stay tuned we will be going in the near future."}, {"review_id": "QKBJ7PjjLUVXt7XUWLrXug", "user_id": "TrUNk8VVyLaa1yJH-WZm8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Excellent.  One of the best meals we have ever had.  Such a nice laidback vibe and super friendly people.  There were three of us, and we ordered three tapas to share-- shrimp ajillo, pulled pork arepas, and crab cakes and then two cutting board items --flat iron and branzino plus a side of smashed creamer potatoes for sharing.  Then we added one more tapas--the wings because my husband saw them go by.  Everything was incredibly flavorful and expertly cooked and sauced.  Can't wait to go back.  LOVED IT.  Party in the room next door so got kind of loud around 9pm but didn't bother us--doors were shut.  Oh and desserts were yum too--try the banana cream pie with chocolate crust!   They smoke their own sausages too.   Hard to decide because everything sounded amazing.  And they take reservations so no waiting around for an hour!!"}, {"review_id": "aRl8zAcshXbcC0Sgn518OQ", "user_id": "kAWYwBjLkSmIFSdTnC0-Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "My new go-to place...great food and love the atmosphere.  Enjoyed the BBQ pork in particular.  Order up on the small plates to try as many things as possible your first visit."}, {"review_id": "tl8z5QfKatxgcZAtMhD4zg", "user_id": "ypOkmdi7ldmzh6lyplQTyA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2017", "text": "I came here for lunch on a weekday, and it was not very crowded. A couple people recommended this place to me. As many reviewers have shared, the service is attentive and the servers are knowledgeable about the specials and rotating beers on tap. I love that they have Aspetuck Brew Lab beer, which is brewed just down the street. My friend and I shared some tapas plates. We had the shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, and the ribs. I enjoyed everything, but the shrimp and grits was especially delicious. They were cheesy, and the  Andouille sausage was perfectly seasoned. The menu is American and southern comfort style. I'm looking forward to trying brunch in the future. They have bottomless mimosas, so I'm all in."}, {"review_id": "Di5BR19OK-u5bPQnVF1u3A", "user_id": "8jlfCKiSxztEDm56ahrJRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "This restaurant rings all the bells.  Very nice staff, appeals to families and and everyone else.

We got outside seating which was really nice. But omg the wait. We came after brunch so honestly there was one other person inside. I got there an hour after my friend and we were ready to order because she had to leave. I got there around 3:30 ish and we left at around 5:15. They apologized and told us that they were having technical issues (for my drink) ?!? I assume the bottle opener was broken? I would have happily ordered something else--but this is fine. Which is fine. They brought out my friends margarita. I waited on mine for another 20+ minutes. They took our order and we were stuck waiting again. The fastest part of this entire ordeal was eating the food.If we weren't stuck waiting for majority of this Trip I would have given it a 5 star. I'm particularly critical because brunch was over and the place was empty. Literally 2 people max inside and us. There's no way we should have had to wait for a combined hour+.We will try this again during the actual brunch. I enjoy this chicks company so if we pause to say what the heck! You know it took a little too long for an empty restaurant."}, {"review_id": "szsX3pW3i2gdpSjAATYVMg", "user_id": "2-cPC4WXqz1cpH5Pjww01g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "Not as happy as I thought I would of been.

In fact, very ordinary and I wouldn't go back for dinner.  Had a shrimp po boy, which, while the shrimp seemed fresh, didnt taste like much. The bread was meh, the salad in the sandwich was sad looking and the fries on the side were also forgettable. Prices seem fair when you first see them, but for the quality of food they bring out, the price is just right or even too much. The bread pudding for dessert was bad, no complexity, just big chunks of soaked bread with overly sweet caramel sauce. I regretted ordering it, and left most of it uneaten. The most annoying thing is that this place seems to turn into some cheesy pick up place at 10 pm, when they push the tables aside, get the disco ball rolling (I kid you not!) and have obnoxious drunkards grinding up to one another while you try to finish your meal. Our server even suggested we go to the bar to finish our meal so they could move our table as well. Gee, thanks! This wasn't even a weekend night (it was a Wednesday). I had read and heard great things about their Moscow Mules, but it was super bad: couldn't taste the alcohol at all. It was just a watery, sweet ginger soda basically. I ordered another drink (a twist on a Cosmo I believe) and that was good, but I wouldn't go back just for that. Too many people pushing you at the bar, you have to scream yourself hoarse to get yourself heard, etc etc. Little Pub, while it's a chain, is much better quality at the same price. Go there instead!"}, {"review_id": "DE2ttP9XeTVc5p8Vd5zQ5w", "user_id": "o0sO3oZEU5vsUCsm2K2apw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Tonight's dinner was a disappointment. Appetizers were awful and the main course was just bad. I like this place and have been many times. Their local craft beer selection brings me back and the owners are nice.  But, the artichoke dip was terrible. I ordered a medium rare hamburger and it came back well done.  Fries were not fresh.  The owner was nice, said it was the new waitress and gave me a burger to go but it was was basically uncooked so I threw it out when I got home. The food has never been great but it's been adequate. Tonight was a big disappointment.  You have to get these things right if you want people to come back. This is restaurant basics 101.

They had a delicious lentil soup and a squash soup. They always are changing them up! The chicken California sandwich was great, the chicken was crispy with avocados and a delicious sauce. The cheese curds also great I did not love the side salad dressing, a bit too mustard-y for me. I also think its all a little over priced. It is $13-14 a sandwich and you have to pay extra for fries or a salad ($2). The owners are great. They are always walking around welcoming people and making sure you enjoy everything.

Moments later she was at our table, chatting with us about all the wonderful choices. We took her recommendations across the board. The pulled pork arepas - four crispy disks under bite-sized stacks of pork beneath an avocado and EVOO dip. The house-made kielbasa with red cabbage sauerkraut (also made in the kitchen). The Brussels sprouts, sauteed and coated with a light balsamic reduction and crispy chunks of pancetta. After our meal Lou - husband of Jennifer - came out to greet us and talk about his food.
