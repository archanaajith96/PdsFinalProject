It was a great experience, the service was probably the best service I have received in the states. The food was great. We started with the Crab Cake which was wonderful. We also did the cheese tray selection 2, wasn't a fan of all 3 cheeses but the one Dragon was really good. My bestfriend ordered the Amberjack fish for her entree, the fish was very fresh and well season. I ordered the Veal Chop, the chop was delicious but I feel it lacked seasoning. I cant forget while we waited they brought around a Chef sample of octopus on a tiny spoon, just a bite. WHOA! the best bite of the night, the flavors were out of this world. We also had dessert ( dessert flight and fried peach pie) none of the desserts were overly sweet. My favorite was the mousse and she really liked the key lime pie. Overall it was a great experience and I will definitely go back!"}, {"review_id": "vDT6lf-vppd2x_CyBGMkbw", "user_id": "lgVLBf_kloHe2mphcWx79Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "I grew up in the South. The Deep South. I left when I was a young man. Now, I visit episodically. And when I visit I often feel like a person venturing into a museum - inquisitive, but detached. However, my last couple of trips to the South have shown me a new side to my home. There is a crazy rich culture of food evolving in the darnedest of places. Columbus, GA and Epic Restaurant epitomizes this fantastic foodie culture. I so enjoyed my meal. I sat at the bar and swilled some great wine with a nice assortment of small plates - I sort of made my own tasting menu - and a relaxed atmosphere. It was awesome! I can't speak highly enough for what the owners, chef and team and front end of the house are doing with their amazing corner of the world. They have found a way to blend the wonders of modern foodie delights with great southern charm and hospitality . . . and it totally works!"}, {"review_id": "_ncvRLkSjzv-OLmygMk6RA", "user_id": "qUCHmPvFz3CLg_PtKpYg6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "My husband and I were so happy when we found this gem in the downtown area of Columbus Georgia. Came here for dinner with my husband while visiting the area, and we were pleasantly surprised at how nice the interior was. We parked a little far away and walked, but they had parking spaces next to the restaurant.We made a reservation for weekday dinner, and there was not too many customers yet for early dinner around 5:30. Did the course menu, and I have to say the shrimp and grits, foie gras with bacon, dessert menu and everything was fantastic. I have attached the photos, and it will make more sense as to how nice the presentation was with good portions. Not to mention the service was also excellent and the price is very reasonable.We didn't come here for any occasion, but I think this will be a cute spot to come for an occasion if you happen to be in the area :)"}, {"review_id": "81ip6wtq1B3jg5zeefD37Q", "user_id": "Oc5Jvu4QtPmsCLG0OUHT2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "My most favorite restaurant.  My husband and I skip out of town and hit this place as often as we can.  The food is amazing but the service is truly epic.  The chef is absolutely amazing.  If you have not tried Epic you are really missing something special."}, {"review_id": "6jCkMavAmlzeZSqeYpqhxw", "user_id": "5-ezUbEwWYnibc6y3J1CTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Everything about this place was perfect.

I choose this spot out of all the other ones that were located in Uptown Columbus area because by Yelp pictures, it reminded me of the restaurants back home and it wasn't Southern food. I feel like every restaurant here since it is Columbus, GA has some type of Southern dish and I'm not really a fan of Southern food, sorry. Anyways, we made reservations and when we walked in I was really excited because the ambiance was really nice, the place seemed well decorated and it was fancy. So far, being in Columbus,  I have not found ONE restaurant that I liked so it was a big deal. We didn't even know this place was a four diamond restaurant until we saw the award on their wall. The service was amazing and I even told them I am 20 wks pregnant so they know I can't have certain things and they took care of that in every dish. The bartender even made me a non alcoholic beverage which was surprisingly good! I drank all of it! They give you bread and butter while you wait which was good, we wanted to eat more but had to tell ourselves to put it down so we can finish our main entrees. My hubby and I shared the butternut squash soup which was so good! My hubby ordered their lamb dish and I ordered the wagyu short ribs. For our anniversary dessert we chose the caramel apple cheesecake (this was the best part). Overall, I thought the food was pretty good for being a four diamond because we've been to places where they are four diamond and the outcome wasn't that great but this place was actually really good. I'm happy I found a place here that I actually liked and can go back too. Yay!  :)"}, {"review_id": "aV5ZIAJ7STbJN7ovB1ITSA", "user_id": "IsQvbtGcCHS7scaqbN034w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "In Columbus for the weekend, went to a couple of recommended restaurants.

We love good food and like to try high-end restaurants wherever we visit. We found this place when we lived here a few years ago and have made it a point to squeeze it in our schedule every time we return to the area. The service is phenomenal. The chef is very good at his craft, but he is also a master at food service. The wait staff monitor the table closely and ensure that the entire experience is well-orchestrated for flawless service. The food is amazing. The menu rotates often, so we have never had the same meal twice. The chef puts together bold flavor combinations and executes it well every. Single. Time. We have never been disappointed with a meal or with the service we have had. Epic is a little pricey, especially when compared to the local area. However, given the quality of the food, the service and the atmosphere, the prices are completely fair and worth every penny. This is a perfect place for a romantic dinner date or a nice dinner out with friends."}, {"review_id": "8yYa6dJz40C9hsdp-Hc1-Q", "user_id": "PdTEiN5vXZrPTvzGGhYRlw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2017", "text": "My fiancée took me to Epic for our first anniversary - the entire experience was absolutely phenomenal! The restaurant is very aptly named \"Epic\" - the dishes were creative and innovative and most importantly they were absolutely delicious. Mocktails that are a perfect flavor combination are available for those who do not want a drink - the staff is very polite, respectful and professional and the lay-out gives you the feeling of privacy even in the middle of the restaurant because the tables are not crowded close together and the restaurant is very visibly clean from ceiling to floor with chic yet romantic decor.The meal, as rumored, is a bit costly but it's more than worth it to go at least once - it's not just a meal that is being paid for, but an entire dining experience where the focus is on you as the guest. You will not find yourself waiting at any point for any service be it another drink or just a question - the staff seemed to be so highly trained that they are able to anticipate your needs as they arise and they work so well as a team that it would almost seem they are choreographed.  After our meal we were given a tour of the kitchen where the restaurant also hosts a chef's table that can be reserved for dinner - and eating at the restaurant I'm not sure if reservations are required but I very much recommend calling ahead to schedule one in that it is not a casual dining experience.The entire experience of Epic goes beyond the culinary masterpieces that are served, the Wagyu beef was incredible my fiancée greatly enjoyed the tartare, but the entire meal from appetizer to salad to entree and the extra yummy mocktails was above and beyond any other restaurant I've ever eaten at. Everyone should experience Epic at least once because it is truly so much more than a meal, it as an entire wonderful experience unto itself and I know my fiancée and I will be returning."}, {"review_id": "yTHapJMygyLsr3AmLwGk3g", "user_id": "FLTBIWcog89ttvVrwNTi9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/14/2017", "text": "This is a good restaurant for a small city.

My date and I both did the 7-course meal special offered by Epic on the holiday. We had an 8:45 reservation, but didn't get seated until 9:15. They was plenty of space at the bar though and they had a great drink menu. Now for the food. Throughout the 7-course meal, we were really only impressed by 2 or 3 dishes. It just seemed like everything was a little under seasoned. They also skipped a course and had to bring it out later after we already had our pallet cleanser. The atmosphere was awesome and the service was pretty exceptional - minus the skipping a course snafu - but it was very understandable due to a busy night on Valentine's Day. It's just difficult to give 4 or 5 stars for the experience we had, especially since our bill was over $300 for the two of us. We expected to be blown away.It is hard to find bad reviews about Epic by other people though, so hopefully we get a chance to try it again and able to leave a better review."}, {"review_id": "tsRWnbvJB37p96fVH3TmAg", "user_id": "fnXf8PZHTvQdFZn2M_aFlg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2017", "text": "Love this place.

We arrived 15+ minutes early for our reservation at 6:30 and she explained that she didn't want to overwhelm the server which is totally understandable. +1 The bartender was also incredibly friendly while we waited for our table, as well as he came and checked on our table a couple times. They have a great craft beer selection, which for us \"beer geeks\" was a pleasant surprise.We sat down at our table at about 6:20pm (we would have happily waited until 6:30 if need be). The server started off very friendly and obviously very knowledgeable about the menu, the chef's concept, and made some great recommendations. I did feel like his demeanor changed slightly once we told him we wanted to do the Pre Fixe menu however we did add a cheese plate to start with. We ordered the cheese plate no later than 6:25 - it did not come out until 7:40 with no explanation or even having our server stop by to apologize for the wait. I understand sometimes artisan food takes time but a cheese plate? Cut cheese, place on plate. The cheese was fantastic but gone too soon as we waited another 30 minutes for our first course, which were absolutely amazing soups. When the soup was dropped we ordered a half bottle of La Crema to pair with dinner which came out pretty quickly. Shortly thereafter our main course came out, he ordered the cioppino and I ordered the chimichurri steak. The fish in his dish was overcooked, as well as I had requested my meat rare and it was medium (not even medium rare) and unfortunately had a lot of gristle. I understand you can't see the inside of the meat to see the gristle but I'd presume at a restaurant of this caliber you'd know the meat was overcooked (I also completely understand mistakes happen). After the food was dropped we would have remedied the situation (as much as I hate sending food back) however our server never came back to check on us and we were starving at this point. Why I am upset at the level of service is that the two tables closest to us were getting checked on constantly and yet we felt ignored. I have worked in the hospitality industry and completely understand being slammed but instead we felt like we were treated as \"second class\" citizens next to the other tables. I feel I should note we were dressed to the nines as once a month we dress up and splurge on a date night to take some time for each other in our busy lives. When our main entree plates were taken away we asked for the check with dessert as we'd been at the restaurant for going on 2.5 hours and our server seemed taken aback by this request. The desserts were incredible but at this point we had been at Epic for nearly 3 hours and just wanted to get home. I do want to note our water glasses were never empty, the woman refilling was on it, thank you!I'm lucky enough to have grown up in the Bay Area in California and I've been to some incredible restaurants and know generally what to expect and I am very understanding as long as there is communication to what is going on. I want to tell myself maybe I went to Epic with too high of expectations but it was recommended to me by a good friend who has been raving about it and feel maybe we sadly just had an off experience but returned home feeling \"buyers remorse\" for lack of a better term. I always go into my reviews as if I was the business owner I would like to know positive negative experiences to always improve.Date night restaurant search continues...."}, {"review_id": "cd2w5Nc8kOhD8wlFehG3Yw", "user_id": "qrsK3cuL2_umcm_8CDvKsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2017", "text": "A unique experience in a unique atmosphere.

We are accustomed to nicer restaurants in Atlanta having just moved from there (Bacchanalia, Optimist, Aria, Bones, etc.) and were looking for an opportunity to try out Epic. We did the 8-course New Years Eve special ($125 per person). The food was delicious, but some of the portions were too large. For an 8-course meal, it was too much food and made it hard to enjoy various courses. Below are thoughts on the dishes: The first course was a Salmon/Eel \"Preface\" which we literally licked from the plate. Very creative. The second course was a Scallops dish with pancetta, mashed potatoes, and a salad which was a pretty hearty appetizer, but delicious. This was probably one of my favorite dishes. Third course was a Ricotta and Buretta Pasta, which kind of tasted like a good home-made bowl of pasta. Well portioned, but pasta is very filling so I may suggest leaving this out of an 8-course meal or incorporating into one of the heavier entrees. This was followed with bread + olive oil (more filling). Fourth dish was a Red Grouper + Crab which was cooked well, but was a large plate. Portions were a little too big with this but it was delicious. Fifth Course: Oddly enough, this may have been one of my favorite dishes. It was a sour apple sorbet with pop-rocks on the top. The sour apple sorbet was amazing, and the pop-rocks were a nice \"travel-back-in-time\" touch. Sixth Course: I had the filleted beef with foie gras. The meat was cooked perfectly, but it was a huge cut of meat. I had to pass off about half of it to my husband (who ordered the lamb and felt his portions were fairly large too). Because I was so full by the time they brought out this plate, I really didn't enjoy the rest of the side items of the dish, which included celery root, winter greens, espresso onions, and truffle croquettes. Seventh Course: The cheese plate was okay. I am not a huge goat-cheese fan, and the crackers that were given with the cheese were nothing special. The jams were delicious though, and I enjoyed the Brie. This was my least favorite course. Eighth Course: The banana bread was dry, albeit yummy. They covered them with bruleed bananas and a chocolate ganache, but after being so incredibly full and noticing the bread was dry, we kind of picked at it versus enjoying it. The Sommelier (our waiter) was fantastic and incredibly knowledgeable of his wines. We were impressed with the bottle he brought out for us and enjoyed it thoroughly. The only bummer about this night was how expensive the alcohol was. I'm not sure if alcohol was marked up due to New Years Eve, or alcohol is generally expensive at Epic, but our bill was over $500.00 total (food + beverage) which seemed absurd, seeing as we have dined at similar restaurants for 6-10 course meals, each gotten more alcohol, and paid less than the $500.00 we spent at Epic. I guess the Sommelier played us for fools with an expensive bottle of wine, which kind of stinks. Two glasses of champagne cost us over $50. I'm not sure I would be back. The bill kind of put a bad taste in our mouths, but in general the food was good and it is definitely a fine-dining restaurant in a town that is slowly emerging as a foodie scene."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/epic-restaurant-columbus?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
