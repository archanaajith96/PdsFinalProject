From the pizza, to burgers, to chicken and waffles, I've never had anything I didn't like.For brunch your meal comes with a mimosa, screwdriver, or Bloody Mary. The chicken and waffles is my absolute favorite. There's bacon in the waffles, and the fried chicken is perfectly crispy on the outside and moist inside. For dinner, the entire menu is tempting, but don't knock the pizza. They have a brick oven in the back and some great options for toppings. Also, the rotating draft list is great. There is always a great selection of craft beers."}, {"review_id": "7AGGKKgxYQk_val3F3mhBA", "user_id": "8rph_A-q3xw-jLl4Q3w4Xg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Food was pretty good, and the portions are very generous!  Atmosphere is okay, the floor wasn't level where I was sitting, so that make for a rocky meal (pun intended)... lol. The appetizer dish we ordered (ribs with asian sauce) was flavorful, and the meat came off the bone nicely. It was also a huge portion. One person could probably eat the whole thing as a meal. I ordered the hanger steak with seasonal veggies. I ordered it as medium, and it was more medium well done. Flavor was good though a bit chewier than I had anticipated. The mashed potatoes that came with it were flavorful and fluffy, but could have been a little creamier (maybe I just like mine really rich). The veggies were underwelming, but otherwise fine. The Russian Imperial Stout that I ordered was really delicious and apparently from a local brewery. I could have gotten another, but I was so full, there is no way I could fit anymore in. The staff was pleasant and the service was decent. We had to flag them down for a few things, and they move a little slower than I'm used to seeing on the east coast, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Overall, a decent place, I would go back if I'm back in the area."}, {"review_id": "Y64l376Dg3dEywIvw0R0Og", "user_id": "KYgulrjFeQIKFF3YOK9M4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Have eaten here around 20 times, the food is consistently fantastic. My wife and I have had burgers, pizzas, chicken pot pie, mac and cheese, and most of the appetizers. Portions are generous and the menu has creative takes on the classics. Additionally they typically have a few nice craft beers on tap.My only knock here is that the service is very hit or miss. Last time we visited our waitress was almost nonexistent and we had to continually flag her down for anything.

Came here to catch up with two college friends on a Thursday night.Let's start with the worst part: the service was subpar, the place was completely empty and it took forever for us to get the waiter to over come over.Ordered some house wines ($8/each) which were good. We shared the cauliflower veggie balls ($14) which were delicious. They had an Indian spice type of flavor, with the texture of a crab cake. Would definitely order again.For dinner I got the shepherds pie. Absolutely DELICIOUS. Best shepherds pie I have ever had and I've eaten it at many places. Definitely worth the ($18).Can't wait to come back with my boyfriend!8.5/10"}, {"review_id": "1GC3ad1ryefrwMuNLW3TIQ", "user_id": "Z8MQ8HXITQj0715Nmia2yQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "Highly recommend this place for Happy hour.

I've been missing out!What we ordered:- CRAB CAKES (appetizer to share): Delicious! The arugula salad was fresh, and even though there were only two crab cakes, they were both fairly large. - TWISTED BLEND BURGER with side of cut fries (my entrée): Honestly, one of the best tasting burgers I've ever had. Never have I ever had a burger made from a brisket, chuck, and short rib blend! You were still able to taste the distinct flavor of each cut, but they all blended and complemented each other extremely well.  The patty was huge too! I only wish it was juicier. Since the patty was so big, I couldn't fit it into my mouth (LOL) and wound up having to eat it with a fork and knife. But each time I'd cut it, the patty would crumble and fall apart. The flavor of the patty itself was delicious, but I wish it would've stayed together. The burger came with cut fries which were super yummy! Perfectly crisp and had a great flavor to them. Wish I knew which oil and seasonings they used so I could make my own hahah. If your entrée doesn't come with these cut fries, I'd recommend ordering them on the side.- BRAISED SHORT RIB GRILLED CHEESE (friend's entrée): I didn't try it myself, but she said she loved it! It was so packed with short rib that she was already full after only eating half and doggy bagged the rest.- TRIO OF CRÈME BRULEES (dessert): The trio came with three mini ramekins of crème brulee - chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry flavored. The sugar caramelization of each one was perfect, and the vanilla one was delicious by itself. Alone, the chocolate one tasted too rich/heavy and the strawberry one tasted too sweet, but TOGETHER, bliss. It tasted like a gourmet chocolate-covered strawberry!- S'MORES PIZZA (not sure of the actual dessert name because I didn't take a picture of the dessert menu and it's not online): Nothing special if you've had s'mores pizza before, but it was good. We both preferred the crème brulee dessert over the s'mores pizza, but we couldn't say no to Nutella!The staff, including the owner (or manager? we weren't sure), was also very nice and checked on us often to make sure we had everything we needed.Overall, it was a great experience and I'd love to come back. I hear their brunch is excellent!"}, {"review_id": "clsPbUT7wvhHCZjiwDpsYg", "user_id": "LBaApMu8K4AED-ALwaLrlQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Well, we all couldn't stop talking about our night out at The Twisted Elm, but for all of the wrong reasons. Between the horribly painful hour and forty minute wait for our food, to the missing orders, dry and tasteless food, terrible service and rude cook, the entire event was a downward spiral. When someone decides to be a chef or a manager of a small business restaurant, you'd think that hospitality would be at the forefront of what they do. Not going to find that here. Mistakes happen, and we are all human, but owning up to it makes a world of difference. Almost a half hour passed of two people not receiving their dinners, one was totally wrong and had to be adjusted. After speaking with management and suffering through an unfortunate hockey puck of a burger, we were all ready to leave.The waitress told us that they'd be sending out dessert. No one wanted to stay any longer than we had to, so we just asked for the check. Guess what? No comped meals. No discounts. Full bill! Naturally, we brought the bill back and told them that was unacceptable for what we were just put through. As we gathered our payment together, the cook stared at us from the doorway with his arms crossed and a scowel on his face  Eventually, the waitress returned with a discounted bill and we gladly paid and left. Outside, we went to all say our goodbyes to the birthday boy who had his night ruined. We had the best farewell from the cook. He stared us down through a bay window as an intimidation tactic! We were baffled by his lack of professionalism and will most definitely never return."}, {"review_id": "Zj67BjiGzpJ684Z6PSQ9aA", "user_id": "leRLXOKGMabfmIYf27jVRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/8/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Still consistently great food!New drink menu and specials offered.

Dinner took over an hour to be served after appetizers were cleared.  When dinner was served two of the orders failed to arrive. After 10 or 15 minutes the two missing plates came out, but one of them was incorrect. When two people are forced to watch and wait while everyone else receives their meal it tends to destroy the entire atmosphere. Finally the mistakes were amended, but when we finished our meal and received the check there was no form of apology or compensation. After we complained they deducted 20% off the bil which we thought more than fair. At no point were we rude or disruptive in the dining room or to the staff. They were extremely dismissive with us when we did complain and after things went wrong.When we left and paused in the parking lot to say our goodbyes,  the chef stood in the window of the restaurant, glaring at us. His intention was clearly to make us feel uncomfortable. It was unpleasant and  awkward.We all understand that mistakes happen. The way they are delt with is what truly matters.

We were started off by two types of bread that came straight out of the wood fired oven that alone was great but with the butter was outstanding. Next my mom ordered the special cream of mushroom soup which was rich and hearty with large pieces of mushroom. A large bowl for $8 was well worth it. For entrées she got the fish and chips which had a great beer battered coating but I found was a tad on the oily side and I ordered the short rib sandwich and swapped out the regular fries with duck fat fries.  The fries were nice and crisp outside and creamy inside with that decadent flavor of duck fat coating them but not greasy. The behemoth that was the sandwich was filled with shiitake mushrooms, caramalized onions, cheddar and a chipotle aioli that rounded it all out. With the meat so tender and flavorful inside and the thick grilled bread barely holding it all on the outside, I had a hard time believing I was in a small pub on a dark street across from a factory. As if all that wasn't enough, my mom saved room for the Louisiana bread pudding with whiskey sauce. Unlike the rest of the food this was a small dessert that was more cake like than a bread pudding. It was topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and whiskey sauce and a side of fresh whipped cream. I had a couple of bites and found it to be really good but disappointed it wasn't what I call a traditional bread pudding. All in all, this meal was far better than expected even though I had seen so many great reviews on here. Service was also very friendly so I will surely come back to try more of the menu."}, {"review_id": "uSXIG4bUDa0GqrXkV6wlaQ", "user_id": "cY3yTiW8KIlUHA4hLXBTJQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "I wish I could give 3.5 star rating. I made reservations here for a birthday yesterday- small parking lot but the interior was pretty nice. It was laidback and casual and the servers were very efficient. They kept refilling water and clearing plates without being asked. As for the food, we ordered the Spanish shrimp a d the chicken and waffles. The shrimp were plump and juicy drenched in a very flavorful savory sauce with chorizo accompanied with crunchy buttery crostini. I very much enjoyed this dish- it took all my will power to not sip up the sauce. The chicken and waffles were also delicious- the waffle itself was so soft and hinted of maple syrup. I think they're could be less bleu cheese. Not bad start. When the entrees finally came around I was excited. I ordered the Icelandic cod. It was beautifully presented and I was excited to dog in. The accompaniments were delicious, I wish there was more sauce though. The fish itself was eh- the skin wasn't crunchy even and it was over cooked. I didn't mind though because I just mixed the buttery roasted Brussels sprouts and salty potatoes with all of it, the flavors danced in my mouth. Overall I was happy with my experience, however my sister and mother did not like what they ordered. Hence the 3 stars."}, {"review_id": "xwoyi1J5onSzan7rEbW3fA", "user_id": "qVU_i71hz2AQ2wD63kFLdQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Love twisted elm! Such a great menu! Different Dishes!

A friendly group came in 15 mins after us and they were eating there appetizers and we just got our drinks. Overall I'm very disappointed with the service, especially when the owner AMBUSHED us practically on our faces to increase the tip. It was embarrassing and unprofessional. But  crappy service gets a crappy tip. Although I did increase the tip to whopping $40 to his demand, I think it's important to tell everyone of how disgusting it is for an owner to demand a higher tip even after explaining to him why the crappy tip was given to begin with.Keep in mind we got there at 5:30PM it was NOT busy, and we walked out at 9:50 PM and we were 1 hr late to our movie we had pre planned."}, {"review_id": "byDBq0XPo4P6ZFYGJwdhHQ", "user_id": "8Zocr6jVED5JQEBvqwEBZw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/1/2017", "text": "Great bartenders/staff. Good beer selection. Food is so/so. Stopped in during a random Tuesday and sat at bar. Quickly greeted and provided a beer & food menu. Their are about 12-15 seats at around the half moon bar and a few high tables as another option. Decided , based on recommendations, a local IPA and their BRAISED SHORT RIB GRILLED CHEESE (shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, chipotle aioli). I loved what ingredients were in the sandwich but the actual braised short rib was like a pureed version which was a little disappointing. I am used to shreds of short rib but this style wasn't for me. If that's your style, go for it. Also their needed to be more mushrooms and onions...The fries were delicious though. Parking also is a bit tight. They also give you the option to park next door which is a bonus.
