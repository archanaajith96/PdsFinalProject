I had the hungry Hawaiian special which is basically the beef, pork and chicken platter with two scopes of rice and mac salad. Everything about it was great. It was definitely a generous portion.The beef rib was good; it was not too charred and bitter. The chicken was good, definitely not dry like how some places can screw up chicken. You can taste the hint of the bbq flavor coming from the meat.My favorite had to be the pork.  One bite of the Kalua pig took me back to the image of roasting pork on the sandy white beach in the island. This really is the closest thing you can get to the real thing.Another thing I did not expect was the service. It is a family run restaurant which I always adore. The service was extremely welcoming and friendly. I felt very welcome there and they were very attentive. I really love the \"island hospitality.\" You'll get your money worth here. I'm so glad to have some island food in Augusta."}, {"review_id": "6JASgcnK3ZndeizCbuXEyg", "user_id": "tjIdhD3ySprBHrhbnNK2aQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I had a taste for bbq and I HAD to have Hawaiian bbq!!! I originally wanted to order the BBQ combo, but they were out of ribs, so I ended up getting the Hawaiian bbq chicken with all my sides as rice.Getting out of my car, I could smell the grilling. The place was packed the afternoon that I went and it took about 25 minutes for my call in order to be ready. I know perfection takes time and the cook everything to order.The chicken was soo good, the sauce was served on the side, and the portion was more than enough for me to eat."}, {"review_id": "95PsD10SG4gsCHuaWUCmNg", "user_id": "89rtLB5aoGVBbo7BRG262w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "I love it here. I'm from Hawaii and it's the closest thing we have here to local food. The service is always so great. The people that work there are very friendly and know how to spread the aloha spirit. The food is very good as well. I've tried everything, but my usual is the mixed bbq plate.For first timers that want to play it a little safe and have never had Hawaiian Style BBQ before, I would recommend the mixed bbq plate or the chicken katsu.Chicken katsu is basically just breaded chicken and comes with a dipping sauce. The mixed bbq plate comes with rice, Mac salad, bbq chicken, short ribs, and teriyaki beef. Keep in mind that Hawaiian bbq marinade is more on the slightly sweeter side of bbq unlike the typical southern bbq.

Even on a Thursday afternoon a few days after Christmas, this place had drawn big groups. Our table ordered barbecue chicken, garlic shrimp, and garlic chicken with scoops of macaroni, rice, and some cucumber kimchi. Sweet tea all around, plus a can of Aloha passion orange juice for me.The tea was straight candy, sugar with a little liquid added. Fresh, cold, and delicious, but hardcore. I switched to half & half after a few swallows.No trace of the meats and sides remained after our lunch. We ate every bite, cleaning our plates. The garlic chicken was crispy, juicy, and well sauced. The macaroni salad was delightfully moreish. The steamed rice was a warm & welcome balance for all the flavors. My companions raved about the shrimp, and the barbecue chicken looked as tasty and succulent as the garlic chicken.The service was very attentive despite the crowd, and other employees were friendly and engaging in the spirit of aloha. I will definitely be returning whenever I have occasion."}, {"review_id": "D90TsGR9qnBEB6BIQ5D72g", "user_id": "BxtDRGSI-vvxj9TG7MEuaQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/19/2017", "text": "I heard about this place on yelp and had to tryThe building is obviously old but they did a pretty good job of outside decoration. The inside is decorated Hawaiian as well and there is sufficient seating. The place seems clean and the staff was very friendly. They have genuine Hawaiian canned drinks that are very tasty. The food was well cooked and prepared but I sensed a lack of seasoning on the pork. Macaroni salad was good but I feel like they were holding back on the rice I think this place could use a little more flair to fit into the Hawaiian theme but that's just an opinion."}, {"review_id": "aSTuPaCXxFIRWcbLJ8NBqw", "user_id": "czL9OwTtTzQvRZv42Dza5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "I was pleasantly surprised - or AMAZED - to find authentic Hawaiian food in Augusta.

We have loved everything we've ordered, but the favorites have to be the Spam Musubi, garlic chicken and the short ribs.  The dry rubbed steak and the beef teriyaki are delicious, too.  You absolutely can not go wrong.  And don't forget to add a slice of coconut cake or two... it's so good.  I look forward to going back to Augusta just to eat here.  Also, the people that work here ( the owners) really are so kind.

FOOD: 5The garlic chicken is everything. It is a must if you visit this place. I will be honest and say that I have no other Hawaiian restaurants in my repertoire to compare the authenticity of this place to, however, the food here (whether Hawaiian or not) hits all the right places in your mouth! We also tried the noodle soup and short ribs, both of which were just as good!PRICE: 5+Cheap and proportionate. The price ranges between $6 - $16 depending on whether you bet the half portion of the regular portion. My friend and I both got a half portion and shared the noodle soup. If you'd like to try a wide variety then sharing a bunch of smaller entrees may be a good idea!SERVICE: 5Oh , the sweet Hawaiian ladies! Our server's name was Hallelujah, she was so friendly and caring, we really enjoyed her energy! All the staff welcomes you and treats you as if they already know you. We really enjoyed the environment of this place.BONUS: They were playing the movie MOANNA over and over again!!
