The flying dutchman really brings out the green chile and swiss components. The pico de gallo and avocado also make it lean towards a fresh taste. I tried my hand at the secret menu (thanks Howie!) and landed with a caprese that had spicy italian as well as bacon which was a whole different experience especially with the balsamic undertones. I was in a hurry so I carried out but did notice a microbrewery next door:  beer + hotdogs = happiness.

Today I had the Real Chili, which came with white cheddar,green chili,onions and tomatoes.  Fantastic hot dog!! May I make a suggestion, eat it with out putting catchup/mustard on it. This way you get all the flavors from this dog. My side with this hot dog was the crunchy onion.  Lots of flavors going around in my mouth when I took a bite. Fried onion strips dusted with ancho chili and UHDC chipotle mayo. Wow! Great food all the way around.  It takes some time to get your hot dog because all hot dogs are individually made so don't be in a hurry when you go."}, {"review_id": "GimhgCcBlDxgzMN1QPCPQw", "user_id": "GjuJHc9dRFAz2ZBen1s5tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "I've been meaning to try this place for quite some time.

Because my sentiments for this hot dog shack are... exactly, precisely, completely in every way the same as they were the first time I ate here: this place is fly.I don't get how people can be so uppity about spending $5-8 on a gourmet hot dog and totally care less about a $5 latte. Good is good, and UHC serves up super creative concoctions that completely satiate my inner caloric demons, I lean on stating these bad boys are a bargain. UHC is the reason I drag my ass to the gym; my last visit featured a Flying Dutchman: Italian sausage, green chile, hot sauce, pico de gallo, swiss...I shouldn't write reviews. This is agony. I want a frigging hot dog now. Today I packed a salad for lunch. In tupperware. Okay, onwards. My tummy is literally growling.Another reason to growl: UHC has really yummy fries, you can get 'em covered in badness, queso and \"The Other Chile\" and blue cheese. And really good mac & cheese. And you'll probably drop $12-14 on a full meal, whatever, it'll put a big smile on your face. The employees at UHC also consistently stand out: attentive, they greet you as you walk in, they're working hard to please your tummy. Now, on to that salad... I can't. I just can't do it."}, {"review_id": "fSIsBLtk-Nm-TXRSePafug", "user_id": "M_eVz2iVlGB95cw-iJ70PA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "Great meal great first time the food is very enjoyable anything that you pick from the menu is going to be different and interesting and will have a load of flavor even the sides are very different Flavorful as wellThe atmosphere is a little plane that you really go for the food This is great for a night out with the boys before some drinking or just needing a comfort meal therapy,  this will definitely make you full I just recommend to get a large drink"}, {"review_id": "5qKXhi6IIEDSqGZ2BoRg-A", "user_id": "T7ECqhV5hzTlJpxHpyC6JQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "Let's be clear - I'm not a hotdog person.

A little on the expensive side...The two dogs were around $7 a piece...the standard soda fountain soda was $1.95 (?).  So $16 and sports on TV - stadium prices?????The restaurant is one of the first stores in a new shopping center.  Hard to find (a little).  I hope that they last until the other stores fill in and provide more traffic.  I was the only customer in the store at 640PM on a Sunday night...not a great endorsement.Good Luck!!  I will check back in on my next visit to the area - we will see if this review can be updated at that time."}, {"review_id": "VOBSLcjr_P-acG5bjI-BSA", "user_id": "ekDObg89-br5ec4Ks4EGfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "You have to love the number card.

The moment we finished our gourmet dogs, I was thinking about the next time we can plan to visit for more! We ordered a mini sampler (usually offered from 4-6pm only) of the BLT&A, real chile, crafty dog, banh mi, rising sun & other chile ~ and an order of the bleu cheese, chive & truffle oil fries and rosemary & garlic fries with delicious dipping sauces...SO GOOD! The quality of the meat is superb, and the fries...so far my favorite in town...totally. Plus, you can substitute grilled tofu, turkey frank, guiness soaked brat, italian or polish sausage, beer battered cod or an eco dog on any Urban Dog....Loved the atmosphere and exceptional staff who truly care about your meal & absolutely delivered a 5 star experience. In fact, they went out of their way to make sure I had a 5 star experience. I really wanted to try their mini sampler, which is only offered during happy hour, but it wasn't happy hour, it was about 11:30am, and they hooked me up with two samplers anyway just to give us a chance to experience it. They made every effort to craft our samplers with finesse and made some wonderful suggestions that we were not disappointed with by any means.

Adam and I had just come home from Chicago, and decided we needed another hit of that famous dog, so we looked this place up. We were so excited with all of the choices that we each got two things... I tried the rising sun tofu dog, which oddly satisfied both my 'dog and sushi cravings, and I LOVED the one with beets, goat cheese, and mint! Sincerely one of my favorite things I've eaten in ABQ in a long time. He got a Chicago dog and the New York dog with sauerkraut and mustard. He was very happy with those. We shared a beer and some fries as well. It was nice that this place had some good beers on tap, I always appreciate that. The fries were okay, just fries, nothing special. The guys working there were very nice and did a great job making our food. My one suggestion I have to really put it over the top for me, is to have an actual veggie dog as an option. I am grateful for the tofu, but a veggie dog would be the bomb! :)"}, {"review_id": "lozZTMUcnPIExx2G4cJ93w", "user_id": "uvRIWLVsIOEHmxz8h8TWxA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "AMAZING HOT DOG!Urban Hotdog's Food Truck catered a friend of mine's wedding.

It's a little hidden, so don't be discouraged if you don't find it the first time. Tonight we ordered the BLTA, Le Bleu, and Cheesy Dog as our entrees with a side of truffle fries. It was spectacular. The BLTA was a truly fantastic hot dog. It was crispy from the bacon and lettuce, and it was refreshing from the lightly shredded cheese and diced tomatoes. Everything complimented each other perfectly.The Cheesy dog had wonderful textured mac and cheese, though I do wish the cheese was much more sharp. Nonetheless, it was delicious and we enjoyed it immensely. I was almost full before finally getting to the Le Bleu, so a review of that later, just know the bacon on the hot dog was crispy and light. Loved it.Everything was reasonable. Honestly thought they would be more expensive. So I really want this place to succeed, and I will support it by eating here often!
