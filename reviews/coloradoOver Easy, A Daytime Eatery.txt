I am very critical of places with Mexican options in different states and was pleasantly surprised. We felt bad for arriving 30mins before closing, but really wanted brunch. I believe i got huevos rancheros. (Don't quote me) The tortilla was actually thick kind of like the masa of a Gordita, my mouth literally said \"yaaas\". Also shared the French toast with the lemon sauce, delicious! Overall good experience!"}, {"review_id": "rfoDra1HhWDYmra8MWlwoA", "user_id": "kbiTY4Yp2rr6R3UdRM4Z8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Hands. Down. One of the best breakfast spots I've been too. I had a taste of EVERYTHING that landed on my group's table (from stuffed french toast to Southwest Benedicts) and I enjoyed every bite! My tip to you is to try as much as you can.It doesn't stop w/ the food though! Their drinks are also very good. I recommend the Maui Waui as it's flavorful jet packs a punch ;)Some of the older yelp menu photos are slightly outdated as a couple of their items were removed so I've uploaded a new one."}, {"review_id": "Zr3IxsAjkM2tnlHDbeKNeA", "user_id": "pFaUyvkb857nyBDeD5bECg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "I love there food! Being in there can also make you feel upbeat with their energy!The reason I don't give them 5 stars, is because when I took my friend on her 21 birthday there to start the day off with mimosas, the bar tender not only refused to serve her, even though she had all the paper work(!!!) but she refused to get us the manager when we asked to see them! After that bad experience, it took me a couple of YEARS to give them another try. The bartender this time was super friendly and helpful. Hope you guys got rid of that other lady - she was very rude! I only wish I remembered her name. I think it started with a D? Destiny or Denise or something? As I mentioned, it was a long time ago now."}, {"review_id": "wTf2Qko1BvjotFdcqnW5cg", "user_id": "7ozjoLD1rQBsRS_gx0mdBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Sooooo yummy.

I came here on a busy Wednesday and had a a large plate of the Crispy French Toast and their House Blend coffee. I loved the raspberry coulis that came with it and felt that it really balanced out the savoryness of the plate. The only thing I didn't love was the taste of the corn flake coating. It was just a little heavy and fell short in flavor for me. Their local coffee was delicious!! If I wasn't going on a hike, I would've definitely accepted our sweet server's offer to give me a refill for the road! I also shared a loaded hash browns which was deeeeelicious!"}, {"review_id": "jXwwpwCBV8aFfr_GmZvzDA", "user_id": "j2kVpPUkb0_HFHqd0NUElQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Favorite brunch to get in the springs! Peace, love, pancakes flight are so delicious, especially the hawaiian one, very flavorful and so light and fluffy, sauces were great! The avocado toast is very fresh and love the bread that comes with it. The Award-Winning Buttermilk Biscuit & Sage Sausage Gravy is a must try! The best biscuit and gravy i have ever tried. The sage is definitely a kick in the gravy and it smells amazing. The biscuit is crunchy and light. Weekend is always crowded and the place is pretty tight if you have a big family, can't really move around much. Great lighting all around with the view of the mountains. The Staff was friendly and helpful! The fresh juices is a nice way to start with as well, the cure and ginger splash will make your eyes popped!"}, {"review_id": "NKUkEXng8JsNJHD4B56OCA", "user_id": "XlrhaNv4cvc4y5_X7QZgBg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/15/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "UPDATE! Over Easy, A Daytime Eatery, is still \"As good as it gets!\"Recently after spending Labor Day weekend in Colorado Springs (mainly for Labor Day Lift Off) my girlfriends and I found ourselves hungry and in need of brunch.Our first attempt to nosh on all the brunch-fare here ended abruptly, as we were unwilling to wait an hour to be seated. That's right folks this place is POPULAR - so plan your visit wisely. The next day we went back at 7:30 and were seated within fifteen minutes. What a difference a day makes!Star 1 - The space is still ultra trendy and very intimate. Did I mention there's brick on either side? Well there is - and I love it! Great modern art and rich rustic woods everywhere. There's even a couple tables outside for those warmer Colorado days.Star 2 - Our server Dana was the cutest! She was so friendly and mixed up a delish Bloody Mary! She made some excellent meal recommendations and checked on us just often enough to ensure our needs were met, but not enough to be bothersome. Star 3 - The eats are still excellent! I chose to nosh on the Biscuits and Gravy. So tasty! Apparently their Biscuits and Gravy are award winning. I can see why! The portions were huge and tasty. While my other brunch-goers had a side order of Biscuits and Gravy and the Breakfast Tacos. I have to admit that I had some SERIOUS entree envy over those Breakfast Tacos! They were perfect! Def going to be checking those out next time.Star 4 - I know that the point of a \"Build-a-Bloody\" bar is in fact building it, but sometimes I just like my boozy beverages brought to me. Dana mixed us up the BEST Bloody Mary! It was strong, spicy, and garnished with sooo many tasty things (celery, banana pepper, green olives, okra, and more)! Have you ever had a Peruvian Sweet Pepper? Neither had I until today. It was so good!! Plus they have a variety of other boozy brunch beverages too!! Maui Waui Mimosa or a Colorado Sunrise anyone? Plus they offer some tasty juice blends for those seeking a non-boozy refreshment.Star 5 - The pricing is on point! $5 Bloody Marys?! Yes please!! In fact my total for my brunch was a mere $16 before tip. Wow! Can't beat that.I know I will continue to come back after my adventures in Colorado Springs to nosh on their delish brunch-fare and partake in the build a bloody bar (even though I always end up asking my server to compile them for me)!"}, {"review_id": "7aiaixUJnJKs-OBzebCP8Q", "user_id": "Mty83rcWAcDDNUwl7OFT6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "The waitstaff was incredibly gracious and friendly while we were waiting for a table.

Oh you want details? How about I walked into this place at 9am on a Monday and there was a slight wait for a table, the place was buzzing with people. I took a seat at the bar, which has a beautiful view of their big fancy copper espresso machine. Seeing as how it was a real lever espresso machine I had to try a cappuccino and I must say it was delicious and drizzled in dark chocolate, what a wonderful little treat to start my meal off right.The menu was tough... as in it was hard to narrow down a choice. I ended up with the Southwest Benedict which blended the beautiful creamy flavors of eggs benedict with the spice of green chilies and chorizo. It was served on masa/tamale with a side of hashbrowns and will not disappoint. The d√©cor was also very warm and inviting despite the industrial vibe of exposed brick and large mechanical structures on the walls. This will be my go-to breakfast place whenever I find myself in Colorado Springs and it should be yours too!"}, {"review_id": "4vuo0r4mWhEhQ5fmBiLiyw", "user_id": "0e2ThozXjUKll8k2FAlNsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "Another great breakfast in Colorado, Springs!Found this place via Yelp and was pleased to see there was a wait (no one wants to eat from a restaurant that's not in demand).

I ordered my daughter a mickey pancake and they forgot to decorate the face but they quickly corrected it with a brand new pancake (I know because because my daughter had already taken a bite out of it, lol).

This is why no matter the city, state and location - it's always on point. Might as well give them those 5 stars as a default rating. Josh, our server, was everything a good server needs to be: attentive, polite and provided us with great dining experience at this particular location. Stay awesome Josh! If you never been to Over Easy - your loss, this place is great for breakfast and brunch lovers such as myself. They serve many different kinds of mimosas, bloody Marries, boozy coffee and fresh juices. Whatever your taste desires. Everyone would enjoy their drink choices. My absolute favorite from them are Egg Benedicts. Can't really eat Southwest one because I can't have spicy food, but all other ones I've tried were terrific. Today I had Tuscan Benedict with salad instead of hash brows substitute. It was delicious! Very good combination of you want to get full, but not have too many calories. Topped that with lavender mimosa and my morning became from great to perfect. Highly recommend Over Easy downtown Colorado Springs if you haven't tried it yet. It's absolutely one of local favorites. All ingredients are Colorado grown, so what other way you know to support local more than going here? This is for sure one of them."}, {"review_id": "kWi1kec17tICJe9UnMAlDg", "user_id": "HXl4gCq4UDPNZ7ubHlSg7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Consistently good.

Was somehow easily able to get parking up front; settling into a table for two with no wait.Waitress quickly showed up and let us know about the bloody mary/mimosa specials. Man, do people really drink that early on a Tuesday? Instead, got a regular coffee to start ($3ish) and the Egg White Delight ($10). Excited for the relatively healthy meal; though when the eggs showed up, hash browns had replaced the fresh fruit it was supposed to come with. No matter, the browns were delicious - well seasoned and toasted. Eggs are slightly runny, filled with somebody and peppers... satisfying with the sourdough bread. Coffee is strong and flows with free refills. Service here is great as the waitress was jovial. Would like to come back some day to try those drink specials."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/over-easy-colorado-springs-9?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
