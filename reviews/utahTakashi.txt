We ordered everything that the sushi chef recommended (the octopus, fresh scallop, salmon, toro, sardines) and also had the large sashimi plate. It was all fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. For the hot food, we had the pork belly which was outstanding; sato soup which was good (although there was a hair in it and the waiter corrected the complaint immediately and apologized); and the tofu (a little moist).For dessert, we had he flourless chocolate cake with Japanese stout gelato. The cake was okay but the gelato was outstanding.The decor is modern and eclectic with fun art everywhere.This place is outstanding overall."}, {"review_id": "zZcdiDMFO5MqrXa_7W5ddw", "user_id": "JR81t2I75xK9huZ33dQ5UQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Definitely one of the best places for sushi in SLC.Must try: Sake Tataki, Lady in Red and Black Cod NigiriAlso enjoyed: Braised Pork Ribs and the Willie ChiliCeleste was great. such a great waitress!!!  Didn't like the Gyoza.

I did not expect to be eating sushi in Salt Lake City, but this sushi was very good - fresh and delicious. I tried the aji, saba, hotate, and seared sablefish nigiri, as well as the salmon/scallop gunkan. The sushi rice was perfect: slightly warm, well vinegared and not too sweet. The prices were very reasonable ($3-7 for a standard order of two pieces of nigiri). I also tasted the miso eggplant (delicious) and the steak (not as Japanese but the flavors were great). They have a large selection of cocktails, mocktails, beer, wine, and sake. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the service. We both felt like our server was annoyed with us the entire time and she kept trying to take away plates. I will definitely be back though, the next time I am in Salt Lake City, since the fish was so good."}, {"review_id": "S0yxHpQaFewBTUmOSlyxxg", "user_id": "2TwqTjcg_57gow6E7XSdWg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Gah. I kind of just sat here and looked at my phone debating if I wanted to give it a 3 or 4...First off, service was great. Came in a party of 10 and honestly, it's tough dealing with large parties. (I am a server as well) Second, the food. I ordered this Combination - Haiku. It had the Teriyaki Chicken, Salad, Spicy Yellowtail roll, and 3 fresh Tuna Sashimi. For the rice, you have the option of choosing BBQ unagi rice or steamed rice.I actually was surprised by the quality of the fish. Kudos to that! The Yellow Submarine was also fresh. The portion of rice and the fish was well balanced. I hate sushi spots where they over do it on the rice and I get full off that. There was this Yuzu,Ginger mix sauce for this roll - that was GAME CHANGER. I mixed that sauce for my salad cause it was bland. The boyfriend ordered the Flank Steak. The server did not ask us how it would like to be cooked so the steak came out well done... which is not the right way to eat a steak. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend any meat plate there. Get the sushi!The rolls that everyone ordered seemed pretty good, not gonna lie. You know what? I'ma bump my 3 star up to 4. For Utah standard, I think yall did it."}, {"review_id": "6FWDoFBfbfmiFwCTtWq1UQ", "user_id": "Z1yy2pa7G3JB7JWJfmeg2A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Good sized sushi bar.  Only bummer is that they are constantly busy with the restaurant orders, and not as focused on the bar patrons as most other sushi places. So if you expect a conversation with your sushi chef (which I do), you may miss that part of your dining experience.Good overall vibe.Great prices.Good fish.Interesting flavor combos if you are in a non-traditional Japanese mood.Poor sake recommendation, but great beer list (all cans/bottles, no draught) with again, good prices.Weak wasabi - that was a sharp disappointment.All-in-all, it was enjoyable, affordable, and I left satisfied."}, {"review_id": "12GiyHf0sLdDNSdPw9c4og", "user_id": "LMPWMy_kvHjlUzVQ_9jz6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "It was our last day in Utah, so we decided to dine here for lunch since we were all in the mood for some Asian cuisine. The restaurant seats a lot of people and it was pretty full for a weekday! I love the lanterns and hanging branches they have for decor.We ordered the shrimp noodle soup, imagine roll, sake tataki, strawberry fields roll, tuna tataki, and 2 scoops of the black sesame and Stout gelato for dessert. The soup was kind of salty for us, but the broth was pretty good. I loved both of the tataki dishes we ordered tThe sauces were very flavorful! The imagine roll was also delicious, however, I didn't like the strawberry fields roll very much. The fish it came with was not to my liking, but the strawberry gave it an interesting twist. The scoops of gelato were big and very creamy. Both flavors were great and the Stout was surprisingly yummy. Service was very quick and friendly...I'm glad we were able to give this place a try."}, {"review_id": "hi2HwTCL78lxEOkjCD3F5g", "user_id": "f7rboYujQLfvvVAaQqhCEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "Sushi is my go to food, and being from Seattle I am very spoiled with exceptional sushi. Takashi is in line with Pacific Northwest sushi, it's that good. I had an imagine roll and fell in love with it. Great presentation and flavor, you will not be disappointed. The service is top notch too. I sat at the sushi bar and watched them make my food. The attention to detail, knife work, and presentation was great. Inside the restaurant is very modern and lively, you can tell it's a very hot and trendy place for people to have dinner (I was also there on a Friday night at about 730pm).  I will be coming back for sure to try the rest of the rolls, they all looked amazing as I watched them come out."}, {"review_id": "u6-bfWNweeP2ndyWKytpxw", "user_id": "7hElQBiE_x2HZk6yJMVgNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Being in the middle of a high desert valley, you don't expect Salt Lake City to have sushi this fresh. Takashi has by farthe freshest fish, second only to what I had in Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market.All the fish chef Takashi Gibo uses are either local or flown in fromprivate import. The flounder is an uniquely acupunctured fish to maintain optimum freshness. We had an Arctic char sashimi with skin on that was melting in your mouth. The toro tartare with truffleoil was creative but the heavy taste of the truffle oil overpowered the delicate taste of the toro. The amberjack was delicately sweet, so was the Ebi. The Uni was creamy and light. The Unagi was perfectly seasoned. Another hit was the seared sablefish, the lightly charred top layer wasjust perfect.The recommended Panna Cotta dessert offered a pallet-cleansing finish to a memorable dinner. The Panna Cotta's  delicately creamy texture was a sophisticated departure from more common desserts. It was dressed with truffle flakes and sea salt contrasting and enhancing the creaminess of the dessert. Thin pear slices, subtly marinated in Grand Marnier, accompanied the dish. The elegance and precision of the dessert was a memorable, classically Japanese, finish to a very fine dinner.This place will not disappoint as chef Takashi has been around for awhile in the Salt Lake area in the business. I will definitely be backto try the other staples on the menu next time I'm in town like thesquid leg, wagyu beef and monk fish liver among other things."}, {"review_id": "aPfHwVP_rezeUt2uPk8YcA", "user_id": "d4mMElL1_ZUTDD_GUPXvHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "The food is really good!

The japanese place downtown had some of the best sushi in this State that I have tasted.The box sushi was excellent, as well as the regular Nigiri Sushi and the tempura here. As a whole, nothing I had here was bad, nothing I had here was sublime, but everything was very well done and presented, it is quite consistent. This place is solid, there always seems to be a wait, and the parking behind after hours is $6.30 but it's worth it.

We ordered miso soup, the flank steak, and the sunshine role. The steak was very tender, and for me, just the right amount of spice. It also came with a green salsa, that made the taste even better. The sushi roll was great. At only $10, there's not a place where you can find a better $10 roll. We didn't have to wait to get seated, as we came around 5:30 PM on a Thursday. I was in a party of two, and we felt a little crammed along the extended booth seating, right next to some other tables, but it wasn't too bad. I also was wondering why they didn't have refillable soda, but those were my only minor complaints. Overall, fantastic place to eat, and not very pricey, neglecting the rumors that I had heard beforehand."}, {"review_id": "husJrvE0pAIiP0mIkTRI3Q", "user_id": "VXy6eNN0Cl2cx_zX15KRtw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "We've came here multiple times, first few times were good.

The food here is AMAZING! They definitely have some of the best sushi that I've ever tried. The service is great and atmosphere is cool. During the busy times, the wait can be over an hour and a half but I think its well worth the wait. They also have a bar where you can grab some drinks while you wait. One thing that I noticed is that each \"sushi master\" prepares their sushi their own unique way. I ordered the torched sablefish on two different days and each had their own distinct taste. Eating at the sushi counter is my preference because it gives you a chance to meet new people. I also tried a Asian beer while I was there that was pretty good. I went to this place twice in 3 days and I'll probably go back before I leave the city and head back home.
