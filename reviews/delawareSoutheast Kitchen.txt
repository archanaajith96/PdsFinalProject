The chef owner takes great pride in food and of his eat-in customers (the place recently introduced BYOB w/a $1pp corkage fee -- how could you beat that?!). Everything is fresh and made-to-order, and its taste shows. You cannot go wrong with whatever you order, but there are a few must-haves:  Steamed Kitchen Dumplings, Tom Kha Gai coconut milk soup, Drunken Noodles are our personal favorites. BE AWARE that if you try calling in to order for pickup and no one answers, it's because they are too busy to pick up the phone. They will not sacrifice the quality of their food if they don't have the ability to answer your call or the capacity to prepare your food because the kitchen is too busy. So try calling again or just come in. It's completely worth the effort. #2thumbsup"}, {"review_id": "xdJ5gVNPM7kqDjTzHX_EWA", "user_id": "usioe8SoUySOGn4XYhNcdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Fast service & great Pad Thai.

I liked the Thai and Vietnamese options that they have. This is my favorite \"hole is the wall\" type establishment that is always great to find. From the outside you wouldn't be blown away. The food was the highlight of the experience. Enjoyed curry and pad Thai. Dumplings were great as well!Service seemed a little relaxed like the environment but it did not let down.

This place is small and off the beaten path but I'm so glad we got to try it. Although some of the dishes are on the smaller side and a tad more pricey then most Thai and Vietnamese places I usually go to they make up for it in flavor. Each dish we ate had intense flavor and we enjoyed each bite. We didn't wait long in between each dish and although it's not really kid friendly unless your child is use to these foods. Grilled pork and rice is. A good option for them if they are picky eaters. I would definitely come back here to try a few other dishes."}, {"review_id": "tstqXtEsLqGniYiDA5i1lg", "user_id": "v2UfhkSLfRKykW72ZyQBmQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "There are only a couple of places to get a hot bowl of pho in the city.

They have around 6-10 tables and an almost open kitchen. The restaurant is quite tidy with big TV screens displaying some amazing food.The servers and hosts are professional and courteous.The food is really good. We ordered -Chicken Green curry - We asked for level 4 spicy and it was really hott and spicy. The ingredient of the curry tasted fresh and was just awesome.I would give 4.85/5Drunken noodles- Agin level 4 spicy, which was bit too much for noodles , but did not taste bad.Would give it 4.7/5Just be wary about the spice level. I guess a spice level of 3 would have been just great.Overall a great experience !"}, {"review_id": "EzG8TVCCQa9iFmJwZrsZuQ", "user_id": "3Av38uh8aHDvZMV_1eojQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "I was in town for work and was getting the craving for some good Asian food. I did a quick search and was able to find this place as one of the higher rated joints around. I made my way over on a rainy afternoon to grab an early lunch. The joint itself is not very big nor was it overcrowded despite being near lunch time. Parking around the area can definitely be tricky so something to consider if you are trying to make your way over especially since there are other business around that would also compete with the parking space. The floor plan is open with tables on both sides of the room heading straight to the kitchen. The owner was in the joint that day and he was very friendly throughout the process while giving me recommendations on what to order. I was actually going to order a few of the rolls for an appetizer but he recommended the dumplings by stating they were handmade and fresh. I decided to go with the dumplings and a Beef Salad served with the vinaigrette chili sauce. I ordered everything to go and was able to bring it back to continue working. The salad was good and standard with fresh veggies cut up and the beef was char grilled well and with good flavor. The vinaigrette sauce was good for me but I could see the flavor complex being difficult for some people as it was very strong in the way it layered in flavors. The dumplings were in fact good and you could tell it was homemade. The soy sauce was also good and I recommend the steam as it cooked well and made me feel healthy as well haha. All in all, a good spot in Delaware and definitely appreciated the owner's friendliness and recommendations. Definitely worth a visit."}, {"review_id": "Z14kUvRpPG4UgWiMLW4y6Q", "user_id": "HtlsbKPBwOPkOXnFuQLlhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "We will be back! Spicy scale is out of five. A two is an American medium spicy and is how the dishes are served by default; they are more than willing to customize the spiciness of any dish. My only concern is the size of the place. I would imagine having to wait on a Fri / Sat night. Fortunately on a Sun afternoon it was not a problem.

Came here after reading the yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. We ordered the chicken wings. I was nervous that it was going to be spicy but it was not as spicy and i was glad because I could partake.  :) The wings were crispy with a thai sweet and spicy sauce. There was some spice. I came hungry so i ordered the Bok Choy side as an appetizer that is made with garlic and oyster sauce. I really enjoyed them. They had a crunch and the flavor was good and seasoned well. For my main dish I ordered the Vietnamese yellow curry with rice and it was delicious. Everyone in my party ebjoyed their dish. The service was excellent and everyone was very friendly.

The food here is so good that It's addicting! I ordered the drunken noodles, the tom yum kung (shrimp). The noodles I enjoy without any veggies or meat so that I can be enjoy it with the sauce. The tom yum soup however surprised me, it was just bursting out with flavor, with a nice little kick. The heat level was just perfect. You can tell that they take pride in their food and that is the extra step that makes good food into great food. I came in here with my family and I tried their dishes as well. I would definitely recommend you try the tom yum.
