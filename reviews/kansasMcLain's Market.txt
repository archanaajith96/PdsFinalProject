(Think smoked turkey coupled with red pepper spread and cayenne mint jam on whole wheat toast. It's to die for.) Their newest location brags a full service drive thru and it's tough to find parking on Saturday morning because it's packed to the brim with people eagerly awaiting their market bowls for breakfast or smoked turkey sandwich for lunch. (Pictured below.) Their patio is the perfect spot to bring your dog and hang out with the kids while awaiting your meal. I've never had a bad experience at McLain's and their food and service is consistent, no matter if you're in the classic and cozy Waldo shop or it's more modern and sleek counterpart. McLain's is my go to when surprising friends, family, or coworkers with bakery treats. They've maintained the classics and I also love that they use local vendors to make their delicious food. They have successfully grown in both size and culinary selection but definitely haven't forgotten their roots and for that, I give them five stars!"}, {"review_id": "O8h4EoCwmIyf42WggzbjOw", "user_id": "dTl-jk5OojEeKC-rSgTWrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "Um...Yes! We just finished breakfast at McLain's and we think it's our new favorite place. The atmosphere, price, freshness of the food, and flavor were all absolutely on point! I got the Avocado Toast and my fiancé ordered a breakfast bowl. They were both light yet filling and tasted amazing. Also, the coffee was super yummy."}, {"review_id": "F1sILMlI0Wl9_T-iJwYj7g", "user_id": "D_OUPbdXLX2ony6ZCtWMJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "I love the pastries, and the breakfast bowl was very good. They have coffee and espresso drinks (including various flavors of shatto milk for a fun latte) as well as a refrigerated case of other drinks. They have a table with little knick knacks to purchase - locally made candles, mugs, tea towels, etc. The inside is very cute, with lots of wood and other natural elements. The outdoor patio is super cute too. Great spot if you're in the area!"}, {"review_id": "bs9v1uq6IFf_wQr0p6IlDA", "user_id": "dYjq7knhdELnYlT-2RouOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I can't believe I've lived here for about 1.5 years and I hadn't heard about this place! I came in on a Friday morning and ordered a pineapple danish and the market bowl. The bowl was great--fresh, satisfying, and not overly filling. This pineapple danish situation needs a lot more publicity. It was incredible. They really know what they're doing with these pastries! I will absolutely have to come back! I wish there weren't so many people in there . . . who are all these people hanging out on a Friday morning? But it's crowded for a reason I suppose. So good!

Modern, rustic, and cozy all at the same time. We just popped in for a quick treat. My daughter had a cookie and I grabbed a latte and some of their protein balls.

The managerwas took our order and he was fabulous so was the sandwich I had however when I went back to get a pastry bag for a leftover cookie the girl at the counter was so incredibly unfriendly and rude just like my last customer service experience when I was in. I don't know that I can give this spot a third try I think I will go to the original location."}, {"review_id": "1WbQUMu9qxyYmHDHWzSXbA", "user_id": "JNsqWkJYI6NdCiAsBJ4V8A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Love McLain's so I was excited to check out this location.  I really enjoyed the rustic meets modern design when you walk in and this place was booming for a Saturday afternoon. I ordered a vanilla latte and I really enjoyed my convo with the barista.  Sadly, I did not love the latte as it was a little too sweet for my taste but I might return to try something else....like a mini cheesecake!"}, {"review_id": "1Uf26GQxOg-HqHXEob_Vxg", "user_id": "pZMpGNjRMUp6awL7CuXxeg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "Decent lunch place.

I've been wanting to visit for a while now.  I stopped in to grab something to-go for work.  I had the CBS Sandwich.  It was so incredibly good.  The fries were top-notch too.  Better than your average fries.  I've heard their chips are good too, I will try those the next time!  The customer service is wonderful too.  When I told them it was my first time they sent me with one of their classic almond cup cookies.  Oh my goodness, so good. I'm glad I only had one because I could eat 20 of them.  I noticed they had mimosa pitchers for $12 and a great breakfast menu.  Looks like I will be for breakfast.  And possibly to pick up a cake for my next family gathering! The bakery goods looked a-mazing."}, {"review_id": "OBO7WT8Byny2V4Z7bc5VnA", "user_id": "5sYJaT7Bg72h_3A53dz-gg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "The food, coffee and atmosphere is amazing!!

The brownies are my favorite and I appreciate the owners caring so much about their product and the people they serve! 100% delicious and everyone is so nice and cool. Thanks McLain's for making me a believer again! Also I worked at the one on Gregory.

Not a victory in that I got a relatively inexpensive, healthy lunch and got to try a new spot, but more of a victory I set foot inside one of the best bakeries in town and didn't walk out with a dozen pastries.If you've ever tried any of the pastries at McLain's, they're damn near irresistible, so you'll know that it's a major challenge of your personal discipline to pull this off. But enough about me dodging calories, this was a nice new spot that I tried specifically for lunch on a jam packed, brisk Thursday afternoon.The space is nice, but it was l-o-u-d. The sound bounces off the industrial-by-design walls and makes it tough to hear.The menu is small for lunch but you've got lots of good sandwich and salad options. I had a cobb salad that was traditional but has loads of differing fresh greens in it. No lightly browned iceberg lettuce to be found here. It was really good, and the dressing was flavorful and not overly thick.A nice new spot and I see why people like it. I'll keep being a regular at the Waldo location due to proximity, but it's good to know the 'burbs are home to a solid, local spot."}, {"review_id": "n-AXtFpf8FVAqFHIRQDX_A", "user_id": "WySqqgj2d8mODRP8QTmPJQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/2/2017", "text": "Since late last year, I discovered McLain's Bakery. It only took one muffin to get hooked so needless to say, the market location did not have to try very hard to win my vote!Of their sweets, I have tried a muffin and fruit-filled pastries - the lemon and blueberry. The pastries have a slightly off aftertaste (like plastic?). Never mind that, the orange muffin is delicious! I would try more, but if you come later in the day, it's like looking at a Thanksgiving turkey after dinner -- slim pickings.If you need more substance, try the Falafel wrap (offered with made-in-house potato chips or an apple) - the winning ingredient being the sweet potato quinoa in this to-die-for cucumber dressing. That wrap is out of this world!The market is beautifully wrapped in a redwood (?) paneling. Once inside, it has a rustic modern feel - very clean with ample seating. The extended hours are appreciated so I will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "oYEXgffz80_Q6ye4D2mbOg", "user_id": "fZNAFrbk78RRVR-BKlfdCQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "The croissants are amazing I had a breakfast burrito and Tim had the farm and they were both very good we took croissants to go and haven't tried the mini cheesecakes yet but they look delicious as well"}, {"review_id": "yCBQ2Vxgrz_t3pMTJ2QYtw", "user_id": "NNf4_G-alJcLvokTv9zg2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2017", "text": "If you've been waiting to check out McLain's Market... wait no longer.  I haven't made it here for breakfast, but the lunch menu (while small) is great!  I've tried most items but keep coming back for the Cobb salad and Chicken Bacon Sandwich (CBS).  Work is really close by and we've made this a go to spot, especially if we have out of town visitors.
