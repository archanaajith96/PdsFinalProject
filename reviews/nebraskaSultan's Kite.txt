I have tried just about everything and you can't go wrong with any item on the menu. The chicken is always tender and flavorful, the meat on the rotating thing is also  legit. The falafel was pretty tasty, but not my thing. All the portions are big enough for my wife and I to split. The crew there is super nice, place looks clean, and usually don't wait long for my grub."}, {"review_id": "SjAhHudrQljsmm2PL12q2A", "user_id": "PrpS423c4c6PK60vVYsbrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "One of the best gyros I've ever had.

Plenty of options from salads, to rice/curry, fries, baklava, and gyros. The portions are big and the prices are very very reasonable. Multiple meat/vegetarian options as well as multiple sauce options for any meal. I'm not crazy about their potatoes, but that is a personal preference. You can call and order ahead or order in the restaurant, either way they are quick. It's a healthy option for dining that also is delicious. I would highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "VN36s20o2bH5gPuCXIZAWA", "user_id": "Wvjnoh9-qFGzPh9s6o2zTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Yummy tandoori in Lincoln, Nebraska, of all places!  Fast hot and tastey.  Naan bread.  Good salad."}, {"review_id": "AKmgIYvqdyAXHAeaGJCC_A", "user_id": "lunEyDZI0A6ExUizWq3nBg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "Brightly lit narrow storefront on O Street in downtown Lincoln.  Simple menu is listed on the wall, and the ordering process is depicted with signage behind the order/serving counter.

The Sultan's Kite was just down the street from the campus where we were taking pictures at and the reviews were great, so we gave it a go. Definitely didn't disappoint! The gentleman at the counter was super friendly and helpful. The food set up is like qdoba in a way--you choose your style of food, protein and veggies. I had the rice bowl with chicken schwarma and my husband had the naan wrap with chicken. Both were really really good. The mild cream sauce was delicious as well. Didn't grab any additional sides. But we did have the baklava. No regrets there! That was the perfect ending to a quick and yummy lunch."}, {"review_id": "I9AYPyxpw7n7ZZw7zDn61Q", "user_id": "lf366C2179D0q3qDu6xBGg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "This is a place I like to frequent.

The falafel salad, chicken shwarma salad, chicken tikka korma over rice (which includes a small salad and tzatziki sauce), and the lentil soup are all excellent!! I also love the potatoes :) I have not tried the gyro meat because I prefer chicken or meatless options. I have yet to try the baklava either, but I think about it every time! (I will need to try it very soon!). The staff are always quick and friendly! I have noticed that the onions for the salad are now cut bigger than they used to be, so I now order without onions...but hey, if that's all I have to complain about then that's fine with me!

Sandwiches from a national chain? nope.  We were lucky to find Sultan's Kite the first time.  Even with a line the service is fast.  I get to the counter and am overwhelmed a bit by the choices so I decide to get a Falafel wrap and some potatoes. Holy shit!The wrap is perfectly grilled as the Falafel is smooshed from its' croquet form and the lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and sauce is administered.  The spicy is vegan and the Tzaziki is on point.  The wrap is big enough to fill me up, but I still have golden steamed potato wedges.  Perfect and savory.  Maybe get a soda to offset the alcohol I had.I repeated this scenario many times over the years we spent in Lincoln.  It got to the point where I would know that I could not finish my meal so I would opt for a Hummus plate.  Drizzled with Olive oil and sprinkled with Feta.  I opted for the olive to be omitted.The cooks had seen us so many times that if I came in solo, they would ask where Wifle was.  Conversely, they would tell me if Wifle came in without me.With the choices on O St, Sultan's Kite is still providing great food and service"}, {"review_id": "D2JYTO8-F6UD_zAkfTP17g", "user_id": "DcFlCrhPCdUxN2FHGuKVsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2017", "text": "food was spectacular, and there was a lot of opportunity to customize the order.
