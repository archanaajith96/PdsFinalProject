There is so much hype, but it is actually worth it. You do have to plan a bit in advance for a reservation on the weekends, but everything here is so worth it. I loved the lobster roe noodles (because duh....), but I really love getting the ever-changing fish items they have. The menu is constantly changing with the seasons. One time they had a massive tuna collar served with watermelon that was absolutely incredible, so come with an open mind. Also get dozens and dozens of the Island Creek oysters. I'm sure all the other ones are great, but this is the Island Creek Oyster Bar! My sister hated oysters until she came here, so if you think oysters are slimy and gross, give these a go. I love you so much, Island Creek."}, {"review_id": "tRUmnLFuBGRbkGe7o2AxGA", "user_id": "hjEM55eOsYCVur-BXCknnw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Wonderful food! Prior to that, the hostess and bartender were both rude. Being from out of town I wasn't sure if I was being sensitive to 'East coast manners' or lack there of, and then I continued to encounter somewhat friendly wait staff everywhere else. Service was great once we were seated. Our waiter continued to warm up over the course of our meal.We tried a handful of oyster types. All of them were delicious!

We ordered the following to share: 1) Lobster roe noodle - tasty! One of their signature dishes.2) Black bass - tender fish, fresh caught, good flavors, not sure if it was entirely cooked all the way3) Oyster sliders (3 orders), $5 each. Good alternative for those who don't want raw oysters.Friendly hostess service, they stored our suitcases in the coat room.

Once was with a reservation for a nice evening and the other was walk in during marathon Monday. The service was great both times. You have to start with the oysters. The waiters are very knowledgeable so don't be afraid to just ask for half a dozen or a dozen and have them choose for you! It does add up fast. We split the clam chowder. It is very bacon based. More so than other Boston chowders that I am used to. I think I prefer Legal Seafood chowder or Atlantic Fish Co best. It does have small pieces of biscuit in the chowder. It would have been nice to have a biscuit on the side you can dip into the chowder. I got the shrimp tacos last week. For 17$ and Island Creek I expected more than just two small tacos on a plate without any sides or plate decor. They were very plump and delicious shrimp - but for $17 I was expecting a little more effort. The drinks are also pretty good. I got the pina pi√±ata. They fill the glass to the brim with ice though - so the glass doesn't really have that much drink in it."}, {"review_id": "VziwDj388dVRyZjZwnP5PA", "user_id": "w15NByGsVedQLmpydJ7gPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Loved everything here!!! Must make a reservation 24 hours before. Luckily, I only waited 30 minutes for a table. I orders various oysters and all were delicious. I couldn't get enough of them. I love how large their selection of oysters around the coast. I think I tried more than half of their selection. I tried all their ceviches on the menu. All wereGood except the scallop one. I'd skip that one next time. The lobster and short rib pasta is a must. Pretty much all their appetizers were great. I also got their crispy sea bass. For the price, it was a great deal with the size of the fish and how fracking good it was!! Usually I skip on desserts but this place blew me away with their Boston custard filled doughnuts!!! The other chocolate dessert with coconut ice cream was amazing.

I just knew I needed to try it for myself!This place is a very short 30-second walk from the Kenmore train station. My friend and I arrived right when it opened at 5pm and were seated right away. We immediately noticed the mountain of oysters chiling in a bath of ice! They looked delicious! Sadly, my friend and I aren't fans of oysters. Once seated, we were given sourdough bread and honey butter. OMG! That honey butter is LIFE CHANGING!!! It was sooo good! It was very sweet and I have a huge sweet tooth so I thoroughly enjoyed it.Before even looking at the menu, which is quite confusing and not very descriptive at all! I knew I wanted that delicious clam chowder. It was described as having chunks of clams, potato, house-cured bacon, and topped off with mini buttermilk biscuits! I could not wait to try it! At $11 for a bowl, this was pretty steep so my expectations were pretty high. Once the food arrived I was a bit disappointed...First off, when I think of clam chowder, I think of thick and heavy. This was much more soupy than expected. I also thought the chunky-ness of the soup would be chunkier(?). I hope that makes sense! The highlight of this dish was definitely those buttermilk biscuits! They floated nicely on top of the soup and were sooo flavorful! They were very buttery and flaky and the soup came with 3! I savored each one of them! My friend got the fried fish sandwich with fries. Her fish portion was very generous and the fish itself was nice and golden brown on the outside and moist on the inside. Although I enjoyed the fish, the bread was soggy from having too much sauce and the sauce was very overwhelming. It was a spicy tartar sauce it was too much spice! Overall, I can honestly say I found better clam chowder at other places in Boston at a much cheaper price. I do understand this is an OYSTER bar and we were literally the only ones not eating oysters. Maybe we came here for the wrong thing? If you're not an oyster fan, I wouldn't recommend coming here."}, {"review_id": "VOYFLqGi9KFQrqPvgQxxFQ", "user_id": "hWDybu_KvYLSdEFzGrniTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "I had a massive craving for seafood this evening and decided to go across town for it. Totally worth it!Hostess could have been a bit warmer but I was definitely not dressed to impress this evening in a dripping wet hoodie and jeans. She did honor my OT reservation though and I was immediately seen to a two-top table. As well, the waiter was a bit understaffed. Friendly but understaffed.I had two oyster sliders to start. What did I say? I said \"OYSTER SLIDERS!\" A slider-sized sandwich with a large oyster that had been breaded and fried, with a bit of white onion. Holy goodness, these were awesome. Big recommendation from me.For main course, I chose the lobster roe noodles. Not because I wanted a plate of pasta (linguine made with lobster roe) but for the ginormous pile of protein that came with it. Three or four massive pieces of lobster (I had to slice them in half!), shrimp, braised short rib, mushrooms, Brussels sprouts and the right amount of cheese. Maybe a little buttery but it was heavenly. Zoom in on the picture I posted. It was terrific.Great location, practically on top of the Kenmore T station.

The interior is classy and modern and the atmosphere is perfect for dates, business meals, and special occasions/get-togethers. I like how the place is not as dimly lit as other dining locations of similar style. For the food, the seafood and oysters are consistently fresh. I love and always get the salmon tartare which is well seasoned and goes perfectly with the side of crispy chips. The clam chowder, while I've had better elsewhere, is still delicious. It's creamy, not too salty, has bits of bacon, and is good for those who prefer thinner chowders. I've also probably had the best fish and chips in Boston here. The fish is definitely high quality, moist, and flakey. If bland, you can season them more with their collection of different vinegars and hot sauces. Another recommendation is the lobster-roe noodles which you should definitely try at least once. It is an interesting but perfect combination of grilled lobster, braised short rib (super tender), brussel sprouts, butternut squash, oyster mushrooms, and noodles, topped with pecorino cheese. The lobster can be a little tough, but I like how there are actually chunks of lobster and they don't skimp out on it.For dessert, I recently had the flourless chocolate torte with almond ice cream(?), which was super luxurious but absolutely delicious and nicely personalized for my birthday. It was a surprising combination of flavors, the chocolate with the sauces, nuts, ice cream, etc. Most importantly, I'm impressed by the service which has been consistently top-notch. There is always constant bread, honey butter (yum), and water refills and the waiters are attentive. They divide and plate the food nicely if you're sharing with someone else and aren't annoyed by it. If you make a reservation, they can add personalized messages to the menus which they print new daily. For birthdays, even if you don't order a dessert, they give you a plate of chocolate/fudge with candles. All in all, I highly recommend checking out the Island Creek Oyster Bar if you're craving seafood and are searching for a pleasant dining experience."}, {"review_id": "oYynaiyJpzihB6G-YG3luw", "user_id": "NJOspTE_Ms-b8ACPKY73Ww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "Amazing oysters elevated by great service.

He offered insightful food recommendations and also delivered some perfectly crafted cocktails. The Island Creek oysters were so good we had to get a second round. Simply spectacular. We also sampled several other oysters and they were all extremely fresh and each had their own flavor profile. The scallop crudo was simple, but satisfying. The monkfish main was also a very tasty dish. The oysters were definitely the highlight though.

They could benefit substantially from a brunch menu. A bit on the pricier side for a lobster roll in Boston at ~$30, in a city where lobster rolls are highly commoditized, but hey, must be a dank lobster roll. I had the fried oyster po' boy, which was adequate in flavor and dressing. It may have been potentially due to the the time of day and lower volume, but our server was highly attentive and let us stay there well beyond the end of our meal to keep chatting / enjoying the modern New England chic atmosphere and beachwood bar furnishings. If timing permits, I recommend arriving earlier in the day (before noon).

And if you have you been searching for the best clam chowder in Boston?!? So have I, and I thought I found it at Yankee lobster Co, until I visited Island Creek. Wow, the chowder is incredible!!! ¬†In fact everything on the menu is incredible. This is by far my favorite restaurant in Boston. The oyster sliders are amazing. Best 5 dollars you will ever spend. They also have a lobster minestrone, which intrigued me. It is something I have never had before and now I wonder why? Lobster in a minestrone?! It's delicious. I want to try to make it at home. It's a luxurious take on an easy, common ingredient soup. Another stand out was the crusted fish. It's flakey, soft, and flavorful and comes with the most delicious vegetables. There is a small amount of broth that had some hints of spicy to it. I couldn't get enough. I also had the \"green horizon\" cocktail. It was spicy and so so good. It's always a disappointment when a cocktail claims to have a kick and it doesn't. But the \"Green Horizon\" didn't disappoint. There are so many things I want to try on the menu. In fact, I haven't even had the oysters! And hello, that is what they are known for.

OYSTERSWe had the Island Crew, Moon Shoal, and Wellfleet Petite oysters. As someone who doesn't have oysters often, I thought they all tasted wonderfully fresh and reminiscent of the sea. CRISPY OYSTER SLIDERSFried oysters on a brioche roll, with chili lime a√Øoli came highly recommended, and did not disappoint! The only regret was how small these appetizers were, and how quickly they vanished.LOBSTER ROE NOODLESAbsolutely climbing on the bandwagon here, the noodles were incredible. Portions of grilled lobster all over the gaff, oyster mushrooms, topped with pecorino cheese. Almost hidden underneath it all, some tender braised short rib. Excellent all around.GRILLED MAINE SALMONFriend had the salmon, and found it rather satisfactory. He's not the most easily impressed, so that much I'll take.BANOFFEE PIESome of us (myself included) learned what banoffee pie was that night. If you like toffee, banana, or both, you will love this!Fantastic spot I will recommend to all my classy friends.

We were able to walk-in and get a table around 7:00pm on a Wednesday. The restaurant is on the smaller side so I would suggest making a reservation. We started off with oysters and left it up to our waitress to choose some for us. She made a great selection of Island Creek, Aunt Dotty, Ichabod Flat, Moon Shoal, Wellfleet and Fin De La Baie. From there we selected our favorites and got another round of oysters. We then ordered entrees - I had the lobster roll with fries and it came with a side of coleslaw. It was a huge severing of lobster meat and the fries were wonderful and crispy. Since it was a birthday celebration we ordered some dessert. I ordered the Apple cider donuts.

Everything about the space, environment, and food was absolutely superb. Ok they brought out the complimentary bread and butter and I got super hooked. The butter was fused with cheese and had a sweet aquired taste to it at the same time. It made me want more.My boyfriend and I ordered 4 types of oysters: island creek, moon shoal, row 34, and pink moon. The island creek was definitely my favorite because it was meatier and more flavorful than the other three. The other three were definitely a bit more neutral than island creek and was perfect for those who do not like that salty ocean taste that some oysters have.I ordered the salmon pate with oyster sliders and my boyfriend ordered the lobster roe noodles. I literally went to heaven when I took a bite of the slider. The bread is so crispy yet soft and buttery. The fried oyster had that nice smooth crunch too. The salmon pate wasn't anything special.
