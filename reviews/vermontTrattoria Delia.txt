The space is quiet, small and comfortable and would be great for a large or small evening out.The octopus appetizer was good.  Octopus is always a risk.  In this case the octopus was a bit bland but the red sauce and arugula packed a nice little punch.  I followed with orecchiette which was a lovely traditional dish.  Very simple and comforting and just good.  Everything that I would want in a solid comforting Italian meal.  Recommended!"}, {"review_id": "ffNQdrbvURXXnSKuFf6KdA", "user_id": "8PVVfJhSNLhjVZD5i45c-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/20/2017", "text": "My wife and I found this gem 16 years ago and just went back with family.  Unbelievably!!!  Great staff and some of the best Italian food I have ever had."}, {"review_id": "eGhDU0k5i2ZQtTdYcOLjVg", "user_id": "Zjvn9kVb_v8ampvBkTkl7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "This place never disappoints!

Always love the ambiance here.  Service is pretty spot on for the most part--some servers better than others, but that is usual. Food is fantastic, especially the house-made pastas. Pastas definitely stronger than their entrees. Anti paste board is fantastic and a great value. Get the panna cotta!!  Would be 5 stars, but their entrees are overpriced in my opinion."}, {"review_id": "y227pISU6v8r8Fsx3ms0qw", "user_id": "ydWY2UIprQdPNOZFOXS70A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/27/2017", "text": "Excellent service,Love, love, love the herb butter (that accompanied the bread).

I can't believe I didn't review before now!!It's my go-to for Birthdays, Special Occasions, or when I just want a Real Treat!I've heard people say, \"It's expensive!\", but that's because they don't order right!All the plates are good sized, ample portions. When we go, and we are big eaters, we go with 3 people and get 1 Starter,(Antipasti), 1 Pasta,(Primi) and 1 Entree, (Secondi). then it's quite reasonable and we usually don't have room for desert.The Mushroom Tagliatelle is always Fantastic! Never had anything but great food and service. (We went once when they were swamped, and the wait was made up for by many apologies, and a glass on the house.)Now I'm hungry... and in MontP.
