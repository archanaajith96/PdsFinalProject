What first caught my eye was seeing the host outside holding a tray of pizza. The greedy person in me thought, wait, is that a free sample?? Crossed the street and to my pleasure, it was. Long story short, the Margarita pizza was DELICIOUS. The flavor combination of the sauce and cheese was superb.  Everyone was so friendly, from the host to our waitress Anna and all of the staff inside. We dined outside, which was lovely. I'd definitely give them a visit when you're in the area. I'm looking forward to trying their Happy Hour special."}, {"review_id": "A8vQ5UhMcdxI26rGOkpsOA", "user_id": "pXW-3dWN__UPpuP-p9mmPQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Came here on Saturday night around 8 pm and it was PACKED! We luckily had reservations though so we're seated quickly by the nice host. Their portion sizes are pretty good, so it's definitely a restaurant where you could share a couple of dishes. We ordered the fried calamari and arugula mozzarella salad to start. And a vegetarian pizza, a Margherita pizza and a cannelloni for our mains. Arugula salad was fresh and light, mozzarella was super fresh and soft. And the fried calamari was equally fresh and delicious but the pizzas weren't anything to write home about. Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad, just not great and a little soggy. Luckily the cannelloni made it up for it. Packed with fluffy ricotta and mozzarella was the perfect pasta to share. Service is pretty fast too! Would definitely want to come back to try their other options!"}, {"review_id": "9CTMu7nDRQm97JIOxrYvuQ", "user_id": "KXWtYmO4Q9Q6CmF35gOCDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "I discovered this restaurant after seeing it listed as one of the restaurants to visit in the Pocket Washingtion DC guide in Lonely Planet. I am so glad we decided to visit! I have never been to a more authentically Italian restaurant than here. There was a gentleman with free slices of pizza standing just outside to entice customers to come in. Amazing.Everyone who interfaced with us had an Italian accent and could speak it fluently - some customers were also Italian and would have conversations with them, as if we were in Italy.The owner himself stopped at tables and asked how everyone was doing and how the food suited them. He was such fun! He even sat down with us and read the guide entry about the restaurant when we told him that's how we discovered the restaurant. He made some comedic comments on it.We ordered the Calamari E Zucchine and the Il Canale Neapolitan pizza. My dining partner and I loved it all. The calamari was SO GOOD (perhaps the best I have ever had). Highly recommended (we only ordered it because the guide recommended it). The pizza was authentically Neapolitan, with ingredients being imported from Italy/Sicily, including some from the owner's hometown! The pizzas here are certified by the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana. VERY COOL. While the pizza didn't blow my mind, it was just an amazing dish and really satisfied by woodfired pizza craving.In conclusion, I would recommend this place to anyone - families, dates, college kids, etc. Awesome to have some certified authentic Neapolitan pizza with a really friendly atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "OxR8WPWdg3f0L9eQN_GXoQ", "user_id": "hFB1VZ_C6K-geZMmPM5IEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "There's a ton of italian places in Georgetown and Il Canale is known for its homemade pizzas, amongst other dishes. It was super packed on Saturday evening. Most people have reservations. They were putting up new tables around the restaurant so we did not have to wait long for a party of 3. We ordered the calamri, Margharita and La Regina pizza.The bread that came with the meal was just alright. Calamari was good though - generous with the lemon and crunchy skin. The pizza has a thin, soft crust and came out hot and fresh. I definitely recommend the Margherita pizza!! Prosuitto was a bit too salty for me.  Service was attentive and quick!

The pasta is cooked al dente (which I love), but I assume the chef would cook it through more if you requested. Of the gnocchi bolognese, carbonara, and salmon pasta, (though they were all delicious) I would highly recommend the salmon pasta! The salmon flavor didn't overpower the other flavors and the pasta was cooked to perfection with the sauce. My favorite, hands down!SERVICE: The service here is fantastic from their hosts to their waiters. Our waitress Nina was super helpful with giving recommendations for food and wine. AMBIENCE: It was super crowded when I was there (probably because it was Valentine's Day, haha) but I would make reservations beforehand! There was a familial-vibe to the restaurant with the Italian decor and warm welcome. This would be a perfect place for a first date or the twentieth date because of the great service and the intimate setting!"}, {"review_id": "KW4-uI-Q4Ffkgk9fSbj0jw", "user_id": "gekp2Z5I4vPGf2NeFnZX2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Been here two more times.

We were seated promptly and our whole mean was complete  (check includes) in about 40 minutes.My friend got the margarita pizza. It was fairly large and looked lovely. I ordered the mini panino classico. The menu claimed that it came with roasted potatoes and a small salad. However, when the dish arrived, this side was French fries (not really roast potatoes, lol). My main issue was that the first time my food came out, it was cold. It was also missing cheese, which is a key component of a panini. It turns out that they forgot to toast my paninis before bringing them out. Not a huge deal, but I had to wait a bit while my friend was eating. When my food came out the second time, the food was just sort of warm but still good so whatever. Since I checked in on Yelp, I got a free cannoli  (two actually). They were very good and pistachios. Also, while I didn't have anything to drink, several people had wine and it looked like they had good options. Overall, I definitely would come back from dinner and this is decent stop for lunch if you want fast Italian."}, {"review_id": "sRERpC4iob8qoqAkXpVElg", "user_id": "4MAMk_BUZUGQ_ieSoPDf2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "An excellent stop for lunch.

The ambiance is loud for sure, mostly from the family friendly restaurant style so there's usually a good balance of adults and children. Main attraction was their pizzas, but my girlfriend and were super hungry so we started off with the Breasola, which was quite delicious! It the air-dried cured beef wasn't too salty and the thinly sliced beef!We decided to order the lobster ravioli too and this was ABSOLUTELY delicious! The pasta skin was so soft/fresh and it was stuffed with a really creamy lobster filling too. There was a good amount of actual lobster too. We also ordered the ll Canale, which was loaded with Tomato sauce, imported buffalo mozzarella, ricotta cheese, prosciutto di Parma*, eggplant, cherry tomatoes. I prefer the pizza crust/bread to be a little more hard cause it was a little too doughy for me, but it really depends on how you like your pizza. It wasn't so doughy that it made the pizza taste bad, cause the pizza was VERY flavorful. Overall, I'd def. come back to this pizza spot. There isn't a huge amount of food choices, which to me is good cause they can make each dish consistent and delicious!  Don't forget to check in so you can get your free Cannoli!"}, {"review_id": "FVoDQ7J_-LkW-FN94H1VFw", "user_id": "H_o8enPPikzVRF4X51aI3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "This is my very first time visiting Georgetown and my friend introduced me to il Canale. The food is not what I'd expected I would've had since there are many tourists here and I'd figure that food won't be good. il Canale proved I was totally wrong about them. We had a mozzarella salad, a pizza and a seafood pasta. The mozzarella was so delicious. The texture was so perfect and the prosciutto is not so salty but sweet and tender. The pizza is perfect for individual to enjoy. The crust is so crispy but yet not hard to chew. The toppings are combined perfectly. But I would prefer scatter the basil and prosciutto all over the pizza instead of just lining on top. My friend is not so in to the pasta, but I love it. The seafood is so fresh and the pasta is cooked perfectly. I would also like to mention the service here. The waiters and waitresses are very professional. They came to our table and taped up our water glasses as often as they can.

Went here with the family on a Friday night and this place was PACKED! We made a reservation beforehand and showed up a bit early but they sat us within the first 5 minutes of arriving. There were a ton of people waiting for a table but they do a great job of getting people in and out (while still being able to enjoy the food) so don't be deterred if you show up and there is a long wait-it definitely won't be as long as they say. A good mix of tourists and locals/popular spot for college students to bring their visiting family members when they can pawn the bill off on their parents. We had 5 people and got 4 different pizzas and 1 salad. Looking back, we really only needed 3 pizzas because they load on those toppings. My mom and I enjoyed the Dog Fish IPA that was on tap which were a perfect pairing with pizza. With a check-in on Yelp, you get a free cannoli dessert and our waitress even brought us 5 mini ones so each person in our party could have one. What service!

Example A: il Canale. il Canale is fine. The pizza is good, but pricey. The pasta is nothing to write home about, and pricey. I actually surprisingly really like the salmon with mashed potatoes, even though it's a simple dish I could make at home. But they really pack the flavor in this dish.

This place is known for its authentic Italian pizzas, so I had high hopes. The pizza was definitely good, but nothing that exceptional. The toppings, which included pepperoni, sausage, and salami, were kind of clumped together near the center of the pizza and a bit scarce in other areas. Also, the toppings fell off the slices easily after picking them up. The slices are also too big to eat comfortably. The portion is very solid, though $20 is a little pricey for pizza.For dessert, I got the Panna Cotta, which was very tasty. It was made with coconut milk and had coconut flakes around it. The consistency was ideal.The service was fantastic. The waiter and waitress that served us were very friendly and attentive. It was my friend's birthday, so they brought over a free cannoli with a birthday candle and we sang happy birthday. Also, I got a free cannoli for checking in on Yelp, and the waitress actually brought over 5 cannolis for the 5 people at the table. The cannolis were of slightly above average quality.The service speed was good, even though the restaurant was very busy. Despite the large number of people, it was not overly loud. Because of how busy the restaurant is, I would recommend making a reservation. In addition to the main seating area, there is a bar too.Overall, il Canale has good authentic Italian food with great service. The food is a bit pricey, but I am glad I went here. I would recommend il Canale to anyone looking for tasty Italian food and is willing to pay a little more than normal."}, {"review_id": "eSYOCD1kkRfbeKlirvV8UA", "user_id": "-TddDqBlYxc-PomcKbyfRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Best pizza in DC!

I enjoyed the fact that the menu only exhibited italian dish names as it gave off a quaint cultured feel for the restaurant but ultimately it was a bit more difficult to order. My favorite pies were the Margherita pizza and white pizza (forgot the name). But my favorite dishes overall were surprisingly the bruschetta and the foccacia bread appetizers. The dish that surprised me the most was their cannoli! Before my visit, cannoli's were quite revolting imo. But il Canale and their chef do an exceptional job in preparing their cannoli. I noticed that all their dishes were of top quality and freshness. My favorite aspect in all the dishes was the mozzarella cheese as seemed to be the most fresh.

It's located on one of the side streets off M Street in the Georgetown area, so def. a good area for lunching and walking around afterwards to burn off all the calories from the delicious food. We got to the restaurant around 1PM and we were one of maybe three other tables, but before we realized it the place had filled up quick. Guess folks in that area prefer later lunches. Friend and I shared the steamed mussels (Impepata Di Cozze) and enjoyed it a lot. Mussels were cooked just right, not chewy. Dipped all the bread we had in the sauce, and then asked for more bread. For my entree I got the seafood pasta (Scialatielli Ai Frutti Di Mare) and oh my goodness...it was so delicious. The sauce is a bit on the \"drier\" side, not in a bad way, it's just enough to coat the pasta and the seafood. The pasta itself was thick and not like anything you'd be able to find at grocery stores, but it was also light, regardless of the thickness. Seafood was cooked just right.I made the reservation for this meal through Open Table and on there I'd indicated that this was for a birthday, so at the end of the meal our waiter brought out a cannoli with a candle on top, super cute!Also, our waiter was very sweet, nice, and attentive. I tried to order using the dishes' actual names and he didn't laugh at my butchered attempt at Italian so, win.
