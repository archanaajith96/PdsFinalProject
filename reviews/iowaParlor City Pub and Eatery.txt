We got the mozzarella sticks which were ok not awful not amazing. My husband got chicken strips and cheese bacon fries which he didn't enjoy and felt sick from he thinks maybe the oil in the fryer was old. I got a salad and the spicy chicken sandwich. My salad was amazing, we both wished we had gotten large salads because it was so appetizing and so tasty. I felt energized after eating it. The spicy chicken sandwich was good, a bit too large for my taste and the bacon was soggy so I didn't eat any of it, the Cajun sauce on the sandwich was very flavorful and the chicken was nice and crispy. My husband felt my chicken sandwich was better than his chicken strips so he ate some of mine.  We would come back and probably just order salads.  Highly recommend the raspberry vinaigrette on the salad! Service was great, decor was cute and booth was comfy."}, {"review_id": "x1T6qrLzisTd3etGpBmt4w", "user_id": "To0GTLW5MGZwOg5TxxZIQA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "9/6/2016", "text": "Not much seems to be open in Cedar Rapids on a Sunday, particularly if it's Labor Day weekend. We had a handful of places we were thinking about trying before coming here and none of them were open. I don't want to say we settled, because this was on the list of places we thought about coming to for dinner, but it was somewhat of a default option.I'm glad we were seated in the other bar area in back because the front portion had live music and it was really loud. I don't want to say that's good or bad, but not what we were looking for a the time, so the quieter eating area was much more our speed that evening. You also have an option to sit outside on their patio that's between the two covered buildings.We waited a bit to be seated but it didn't take too long and drink orders were taken immediately after we sat down. I got a beer flight, which was quite substantial at four 7 oz. pours for $13.75. They have many beers from which to chose and a lot of options that I hadn't seen elsewhere.My friends and I started off with the Onion Rings and they were pretty good. They are thick and were warm-hot. We were able to eat most of them right away without burning our fingers, which was nice at the time but maybe should have been a warning of what was to come from the kitchen.My friend got the Juicy Lucy with fries. Her husband and I ordered our own Rib Eye steak dinners that came with Seasonal Vegetables and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. It was a long time before our food came out, but they were pretty packed and that was expected. What wasn't expected was that the fries were cold, the mashed potatoes were cold, and the veggies and steak were just barely warmed up. The second steak didn't come out with our meals and we waited. We waited a long time.When the waitress returned with the other order, it was smothered in onions and mushrooms, which isn't how it was ordered. This is when I asked her to have them remake my meal and we let her know about the fries (the Burger was the right temperature probably since it's stuffed with melted cheese). And even though it took a lot longer for the second steak to come out (the order was placed at the same time as mine), we found it was also not very hot. So this is when we decided we were done.My friend tried to find our waitress in the restaurant but all the waitstaff was running around and busy. I was finally able to flag her down when she came by us again. I informed her that I'd prefer my meal not be remade since the the second steak had come out cold (and I think a few other tables were experiencing similar issues but I can't verify it), even after pointing out to her that the other meals hadn't been that warm, and especially since the order was wrong. She asked how we wanted it handled and something to the effect of if we wanted to be discounted. I told her we wanted the steak meals to be removed from the bill since we wouldn't be eating them."}, {"review_id": "mFsl98KxC1RlFKKTTKh9Sg", "user_id": "piowfUG1AWdMYhQ0AI20yQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/22/2017", "text": "My wife and I stopped in here to enjoy a burger and sample some great craft beers.

But I wasn't thrilled with the service or menu. The waitress taking my order was very stern and reminded me of a drill sergeant, not someone I felt comfortable asking my questions about the menu to. I will say though that her \"no bullshit\" attitude got the job done and perhaps in a busy pub where she's being asked to cover too many tables, that's the best approach. The breakfast menu, tasty classic midwestern fare, didn't offer very many options, and there wasn't a single vegetarian dish. What?! There were several hashbrown skillet dishes which all sounded tasty but were all very meaty, and the only omelette was a build your own option which asked you to pick your meat and then pick your vegetable. I ended up ordering the shipwreck hashbrown skillet and substituted the meat out for broccoli. I was served a meatless shipwrecked as I asked, with broccoli garnish spread across the top. Not quite what I had in mind but it was still tasty - really, you can't go wrong with egg, cheese, hashbrowns, and a hefty dose of Cholula hot sauce. I'd go back for beer and apps because the atmosphere both inside and out on the back patio is great, but I was disappointed that they didn't offer a single vegetarian option."}, {"review_id": "v6TnF2gA_bl_y2DvxI97kQ", "user_id": "AAqCWD6MLM2sA8CTJLvZsg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/25/2016", "text": "We went on a Sunday afternoon, it was a beautiful day so we sat on the patio, very nice ambiance. Not sure if the were short staffed but the service was slow, albeit pleasant. I ordered the blackened chicken salad with bacon, the flavor was ok but the portion was too large. I ordered chipotle ranch dressing that was more of a sandwich spread than a salad dressing, meaning it was too thick for a salad and had more chipotle than ranch flavor. We had fried dill pickle chips because why not? They were interesting, the batter they were fried in had dill in it, didn't understand that but they tasted ok. My husband got a Memphis sandwich which is BBQ pork with coleslaw and he really enjoyed it. He ordered handcut French fries with it that had so much salt it was visible and rendered them inedible. Our server graciously bought us another order of fries with less salt. The Bloody Mary bar is a great concept and for once I actually enjoyed a Bloody Mary out that had the right spice that I like, but I was a bit concerned about all the hands dipping in the olives, pickles, peppers, etc so I steered away from that. Overall, not a bad experience and I would try it again but without the patio seat and the Bloody Mary not sure the food is worth it."}, {"review_id": "O9HHGIEn_YOqkpPue_QJOQ", "user_id": "4A_SOiUgnH8acYZN7TvKvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/21/2017", "text": "We were seated right away, but didn't like our seats.

I'm greeted quickly as I settle at the bar and have a beer menu in hand shortly. I get the feeling my previous review has prompted a bit of an attitude shift, which is welcome. It's hard to tell since I'm a known factor now, and I've come to know some of the staff who were mortified when told of my previous experiences at the bar, so take it as you will.   The couple sitting next to me found a very long hair in their juicy lucy burger. It happens but I've got to mention that. I've also posted a photo that should really tell the story of this establishment overall : not a reflection of the employees but the management. That photo shows the hole in the tile above the single urinal in the mens bathroom. I first noticed in October of 13, took a photo back in January and still in mid-april they haven't made any effort to replace a single large tile directly where male customers stare for several minutes while in silent contemplation. The bathroom feels like an afterthought (broken soap dispenser and dirty sink area) and it wouldn't cost more than $100 to replace the tile and grout but they tried to cover it - poorly - with some metal beer signs that have since been pried away from the wall.If you want a decent rating you need more than food, you need more than service - you need to present your establishment properly as well. It takes two hours and two hands to replace tile and they've ignored that for at least 6 months...what else has been neglected behind the scenes?I dont have anything personal against Parlor City, I want it to represent the best my hometown has to offer... but I cannot honestly recommend it as a top-flight establishment when it relies on one-star reviews  before management notices there's a problem. Shabby bathrooms and hair in the hamburgers? No thanks. 2 1/2 stars for improved service, a long ways to go for a full three or more. For the price ($15-20 per person for food and one beer) I expect more.I was also told there were drink and food specials but didn't see any mention of either anywhere. I really want to like the place but aside from the beer selection I simply cannot recommend Parlor City."}, {"review_id": "tVsgZYIiFFe26EO-CYzKSw", "user_id": "RJw5WkFp6eMjTZYnt3saTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/19/2016", "text": "I went here today with a group of my co-workers.
