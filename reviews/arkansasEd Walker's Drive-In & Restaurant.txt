There used to be pictures in the hallway, and a painting of the restaurant from when it originally opened in the 1940's. The pictures could have been put together in a collage, but I think he just threw them away, not caring what they might've meant for some folks.The food isn't bad, but it's not fairly priced. More than $10 for a sandwich?! Plus, if you want to eat small, and ask for an extra plate... it costs a dollar. It's greed, and in my opinion, it takes away from the tip for the waitress. When you have loved ones in the hospital, food isn't cheap. I guess next time I'll go to Burger King or Wendy's."}, {"review_id": "5-SB9EpcyfMYq39uTJFKQQ", "user_id": "RbRC2-_iO_dcw8pG-neBaQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "A gem out in Fort Smith!  Ventured out to Fort Smith today and came across this diner by chance.  Great food and great service plus a fun retro atmosphere.   Can't go wrong with their French Dip.  Had a sample of my wife's and it was delicious!  I had the Toms Hot Chicken which was a chicken patty breaded and tossed in Red Hot sauce.

Razorback Burger is probably the best burger in town.... hands down!!  Club Sandwich was beautiful to look at & eat. The Fried Mushrooms were hot & juicy.  Only complaint..... I think... were the fries, they should have cooked a few more minutes because I prefer my fries a bit more done.  Over all EXCELLENT!!"}, {"review_id": "6GiVOWhAtSZsX3585gdH2A", "user_id": "deEZ_4JTV2S_dwUsVvBTEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "Just had one of the best hamburger steaks in the area!

The place is old and so has that feel of the past that adds to the experience. I decided to go for the French Dip Sandwich & fries. It was very good. The reason that I didn't rate it higher, was not because of the food. It was because when I walked in, the place had a faint smell of.... maybe spoiling food. There were no tantilising smell as in a normal restaurant. I decided to try it anyways and was very glad I did because the food was very good.Hopefully the smell was a drain problem or something that was a one time deal. The other reason for not giving a higher rating, was because it seemed a bit pricey for a diner who is no longer in the happening part of town. I paid $13+ for a drink, sandwich and fries (not counting the tip) which was adequate portions but no large portions as one might expect for that price. I plan to try it again because the food was wonderful & I liked the old time feeling the place held but hope the smell is better."}, {"review_id": "qXL3jyK_Je5vosmBEJXSUw", "user_id": "BCPpeaORmcDQ1JGgEaHVAw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "Ed Walker's Drive In has a nice old fashioned diner vibe, the same you'd see in movies. The servers are extremely sweet and nice ladies that will make sure you're taken care of at all times. I and 9 other friends reserved a big table. The wait for the food was not fast, but not long either, roughly 15ish minutes.I got what the diner is famous for: the French Dip, a baguette sandwich with cheese of your choice and roast beef. Although just a hint dry, dipping the sandwich in the juice makes it melt in your mouth delicious. Overall great food and great service. Definitely would drive by here again!"}, {"review_id": "Vw8txVzIsWnRXmtcIENLNg", "user_id": "vTZYK2Z9UkP7SVDNNLd0Dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2017", "text": "Driving through late at night and found it while looking for a hotel and thank goodness we did. It is an experience that must be had. We ordered the French Dip with fried pickle chips and finished it off with a piece of peanut butter pie. The french dip was like no other one I have had. It was popping with flavor with meat so tender, I could not believe what I was tasting. The pickle chips were quality; they would make any southern proud. The pie was good and a nice treat to end a delicious meal. I was just passing through Fort Smith, but if I am ever close to that area again, I will be back for Ed's French Dip."}, {"review_id": "8uso2dYp7rrexroq05nvow", "user_id": "WwVzSqZykBtKkSK0mkAy0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2017", "text": "This place is a little slice of nostalgia in the heart of Fort Smith, Arkansas. Came through town while on a road trip and needed some food late night. So glad to have stumbled upon this little gem. Ed Walker's is known for its French dip, so the choice was obvious. And, I'm pretty sure it was the best French dip I've ever had. The roast beef was tender and juicy, the au jus rich and peppery. If I had to make one small critique, it would be the bread. Instead of using a soft hoagie-type loaf, use crusty French bread instead. That's so much better to soak up the juice. Regardless, the sandwich was delicious. Also ordered a side of fried pickles, and I love how the restaurant gives you the choice of either chips or spears. No self-respecting Southern girl would eat her fried pickle chips any other way! But, I appreciate them giving a choice! While I didn't have room for dessert, I did order a piece of the peanut butter pie to go. I ate that for breakfast the next day, and lordy it was so rich and creamy and good! They had several other pies and desserts in various cases. You could probably come here just for them! If you're ever in town, make sure to stop in. This place is 50s kitsch in a French dip sandwich -- both you won't likely ever forget!"}, {"review_id": "Y1raDGkZReMPmWK8zF8KSw", "user_id": "70mH6WOn8vqtQ_Wklgbe2g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "Daily Blue Plate Specials. My favorite is Thursday's special. It is turkey, dressing, potatoes, green bean casserole. It's like a mini Thanksgiving meal. They also have pretty good desserts. Just be sure to ask how long they have had them. Like most, the cakes get a little dried out after a few days. Overall, most things are good.
