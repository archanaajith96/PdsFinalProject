While people wait to be seated, they can browse the new fully illustrated Harry Potter books, or read about the history of the sufferage movement. The bookstore section doesn't look that big when peeking into the front windows, but it is deceptively comprehensive. The wafting smell of food makes browsing the cookbooks more fun as well. Given the size of the space, I was very impressed with how thoughtfully the books for sale had been chosen, even to the point of feeling curated."}, {"review_id": "Du0qlhBSddh_ID0hYvvgog", "user_id": "HBGPBZoQ3rS-mUUWaW6Ruw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I finally made it back here after a long absence and I still love it.  The atmosphere is great and the staff are charming.  Shout out to the young lady who told me about the wonderful benefits of the pineapples which accompanied my French toast. She was sweet and quite the charmer.  The bartender at 10:30am on the Monday morning that I visited (don't judge me) was a cool guy. He seemed to genuinely be a very kind-hearted person.  You don't meet too many people like that in the \"real world\" these days.  Service here is pretty quick and the food is still amazing. I'm going to add this place back to my DC rotation.  There's a pretty nice beer selection so I'd likely come in for a happy hour trip sometime.  I also trust them for their soul food selections so I'll certainly do dinner here again sometime as well.  Whether you come here for brunch or just come to read a book, do come and relax and enjoy."}, {"review_id": "uu5IQZ6VEweIniA4uvIwUA", "user_id": "s5FMlSB4QBTX75K1wDHJiw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I went back and forth on what to give this review for multiple reasons and overall I think it faired in the middle due to the overall experience. No matter how much I want to like this place it fell short in some areas and it just couldn't get there, unfortunately. I found this place by doing a search for Vegetarian options near me and found it had gotten good reviews, not to mention the menu looked good for my husband ( who's not Vegetarian) as well. So, it was on the list of places I must go while in DC. Upon entering it was extremely busy and almost looked like we were walking into a  Barnes & Noble. Now don't mistake me, I liked it, it had a comfortable vibe and a art like feel in some aspects, yet in other ways the way some items were displayed made it seem to retail like.... My biggest complaint upon entering was the lack of air conditioning!!!! It happened to be much warmer this particular afternoon and with that many bodies the place was warm, almost uncomfortable where you debate to walk out. We continued to take our seat... we sat by the extremely baking windows. The young lady that sat us was not the most friendly, but did tell us our waiter would be with us shortly. That he was. Though not friendly at first to the point of almost seeming annoyed he had another table to wait on, he did warm up. We even went with his recommendations on meal choices. I had the Vegan BBQ bites and Brussels spouts. To drink I ordered the lemonade. The lemonade was rancid it tasted like it had been out for a week it was so awful!!! The manager happened to be passing by and I let her know I replaced it with a green tea. That ended up tasting like soap! I let it go and just ate my lunch, eventually i just drank it. The Brussels were some of the best I have ever tasted!! They were moist yet crispy and extremely flavorful...fantastic! The bbq Vegan wings... they were good, not great. The sauce made the vegan wings soggy. I would have preferred them more crispy and not soggy. My husband had the lamb burger and he absolutely loved it along with the bean soup!!! So, my take is that this place is an amazing concept and has awesome potential!! Maybe we caught them at a off time, I don't know. I will try this place again because I want to love it so much! If in the area I think it's definitely worth trying."}, {"review_id": "luPnEkXqBFFWnaZ9M_HiRw", "user_id": "LG9pEWEJiwj8S3_ZaIPZMg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "A lively, yet somehow, cozy brunch spot.After eyeing diners eating in comfy chairs for a few months, I finally decided to visit Busboys and Poets! To begin, I loved that I could add my name to the waitlist via the Yelp app. Seriously, it was so convenient. I got a text when my table was ready and it prevented any unnecessary confusion between us and the hostesses. We were seated in the coach row with a comfy chair on my side. The table was a little low- like a real coffee table! For my meal I ordered the Mekhleme (my friend got it too!) Super flavorful and I appreciate that it was mostly beef and tomato sauce and not an abundance of potatoes in the hash. As a lover of plantains I couldn't resist ordering a side. And while these two dishes didn't necessarily go together, the fact that they are both on the menu at Busboys and Poets should indicate how diverse their menu is! There is something for anyone to eat and next time I would love to try a lunch salad, as those looked refreshing and flavorful!"}, {"review_id": "8k9zp6J0upnOuMQvXXZ4hA", "user_id": "zg6LAy9gGLVH9JtcYP9gJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Liberal and progressive food spot and bookstore.

Huge and beautiful restaurant. I had the poached pear salad with chicken and I devoured the entire thing. Super filling but light and delicious. My companions had burgers and fries which all looked amazing too! They had a lot of vegan options which is awesome and all of their food is great quality.

We went to Bus Boy & Poets on our last trip to DC and loved it. The whole bookstore/theatre set up is pretty original. The bookstore is stocked with lots of ethnic books which I can totally appreciate. Very hard to come across some of these books in a regular bookstore (if you can even find one anymore). I can't remember what I had for dinner 8 years ago, but I definitely remember the bread pudding. I didn't want to be that person to drag everyone else somewhere for dessert, but when the hubby and his aunt insisted we go for a drink/dessert, I was game. Very much enjoyed my dessert."}, {"review_id": "KCs6o-LD5mkcwNgKaCjj1w", "user_id": "6Jz-SAiZba0QmgrTQy2vUA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "This place is the most choatic and lively restaurant I have been to.

We were able to get on the waitlist in advance (but it wasn't long -- 25 minutes for a party of 5) around 2pm. We loved the vibe of the place -- from the bookstore in the front to the music that played throughout the restaurant. We chose to partake in the brunch specials -- $5 mimosas (just ok) and $8 bellinis (much better). We also ordered other drinks -- most notably the \"If You Like Pina Colada\" which was delicious. They were reasonably priced, all around $12. I had the Sweet Potato Pancakes w/ Scrambled Eggs & Turkey Sausage. The pancakes were very good and I appreciate that they serve 100% maple syrup here. There was a slight mishap where a hair was in my eggs, but they were immediately taken away and replaced with what appeared to be a larger portion of eggs. The rest of my party enjoyed their food and there were no complains. Eden, our server was super friendly and attentive. Busboys is definitely worth a try!"}, {"review_id": "yonmmEQa21rGZq9KvCLOtw", "user_id": "mN8fyBuA6ruTOg7BXIcQ7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "BEST.FRIED.CHICKEN.EVER!The front of the restaurant also has a bookstore, super cute.

On a Friday for lunch we didn't have a wait but on Saturday for brunch, we joined the Yelp waitlist for the ~20min wait around noon. I got the poached pear salad which was so yummy and my friend got the avocado panini which was also great. The brunch menu was more limited in its options and the food was okay. We got a side of the sweet potato pancakes to investigate the hype- and I don't recommend it, it was average.

For starters, they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait or send someone to put your name in ahead of time. The Mekhleme, or Iraqi corned beef hash, reminded me of beanless chili sprinkled with a few cubed potato chunks and two eggs cracked in the middle. I adored the mini skillet presentation. The hash was a little salty for my taste and ultimately felt a little heavy for breakfast. The Florentine benedict was pretty standard. I wish there was a different option for a potato side; house potatoes, in my opinion, are the saddest breakfast potato preparation. Not particularly crispy and not particularly flavorful. Fortunately, they'll let you substitute fries. After giving this place a second shot, I guess I just don't understand the hype."}, {"review_id": "Buc0bmhFwG5zDBsFoWSr5Q", "user_id": "8FQzr-OHXLdqTWtrzAkoog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I finally made it to Busboys and Poets! It's beautiful! You are greeted by the bookstore and the bar and hostess. It was a Monday a little after 12 noon so the restaurant wasn't crowded. We were seated promptly and our server Malik introduced himself. My mother ordered the Pomegranate Lemonade and I ordered the Hot Cider, since it was a little chilly and rainy outside.The Pomegranate Lemonade was delicious and the Hot Apple Cider was perfect! I would definitely order both again. I then asked the server for recommendations and he was very knowledgeable. I went with the Blackened Royal Sea Bass Sandwich with Tabbouleh. My mother ordered the Crab Cake Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries.  My oh My! The Sea Bass Sandwich was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the bottom bread got a little soggy so you may want to ask them to toast bread a little more, but the wet bread didn't bother me because the fish was so good And such a great portion. Yes yes yes to tabbouleh. The Crab Cake Sandwich was tasty. However you will get more garnish and bread than Crab Cake, which is fine if you don't want to be stuffed. It allowed my mom to finish every single sweet potato fry! I'll be back Busboys & Poets!!!

My goodness. Yassssss~ within the past year, I became vegetarian but my bf has not. So this place was perfect for the combination of us. We both are breakfast/brunch lovers so we only looked at that menu. They had sandwiches and such but we were there around brunch time as well. On the menu, they have the meat and vegetarian options all on one menu. But if it gets confusing to look at, they have a separate menu that shows only the vegetarian options. The place itself was pretty cool because it was a restaurant but when you first walk in, it's a bookstore. Both me and my bf ordered an omelette with home fries which are basically roasted red potatoes. He ordered the western omelette which has ham, mushroom, cheddar, and wheat toast. I ordered the Oaxaca omelette which has black beans, cheese, pico, guac, and toast as well. With any omelette or egg option, you can ask them to substitute with egg whites as well. Everything was perfect tasting and the amount was beautiful as well.
