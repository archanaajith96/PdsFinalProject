There is a huge sign outside of the shop, you can't miss it. Street parking is available, we lucked out and found a spot nearby. The inside of the shop was packed with customers... my husband and I felt super rushed to make a decision as the cashiers called out to us for our orders -_-I ordered the Cheese Steak. I liked how the meat was finely chopped and perfectly cooked, but I was disappointed in the lack of cheese. They definitely do NOT skimp on the meat. The bread was good too, very soft and it soaked up the flavors of the steak. I was given a side of hot peppers, they were a little too salty for my taste.Overall, I would recommend this spot if you want a meaty Philadelphia cheesesteak with a TINY bit of cheese -_-"}, {"review_id": "pFhRmYZO_TqdXJM5q81RNg", "user_id": "cyKbqeO-HM7rarA4vYof5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I went to Philadelphia specifically to try a few cheesesteak restaurants.  My expectation was the sandwich would not only be better than the \"Philly\" cheesesteaks I had in any other state but would taste way better.Dellasandro's is what I expected.  Bar none, the best cheesesteak I had in Philadelphia."}, {"review_id": "PiM7T3NSl1Us97P6QLV3bA", "user_id": "Xstf9n7v8rSOryJAuY2S7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "The first thing you notice when you unwrap the foil around the cheesesteak is those massive onions. The meat at Dalessandro's is very finely chopped. The American cheese we got on it was all at the bottom of the cheesesteak, making the distribution a bit off. That's pretty much the basics of Dalessandro's. It's a big cheesesteak, a lot of meat. For $9, I'd say the price of the cheesesteak is pretty solid. I wouldn't say taste-wise it's the best, but it's decent.

I went on a mini cheese steak tour into the city with my friends, and we went to eight total places. My review will reflect my opinion of only a basic cheese steak with choice of cheese, and in comparison to each other. I'll additionally disclose when I went to each place, to consider how full we already were.Stop 1 of 8. For 11 in the morning on a Tuesday, this amount of customers that came to this place truly spoke testament to how popular and well received this place is. It was packed, hectic, and had the vibe I looked for in a Philly cheesesteak place, and definitely did not disappoint. It had nice big onions and a ton of meat. Though it was our first stop, it was my second favorite, and I will definitely go again. I highly recommend it."}, {"review_id": "LaspS83GLgu371ordq52OA", "user_id": "hRaY78CBo75BFCTcgZM9Eg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Look, if you come to Philly and need to get the AUTHENTIC cheesesteak, come here. I was recommended by a coworker who lives a few minutes nearby when I visited on a weekend visit for Royal Rumble and had to not leave this city without going for the real thing..totally worth the long line and wait! Now here's the big thing in our digital age, BRING CASH. They have an ATM on site but this place is truly tiny and on the Sunday I came here it was literally less than elbow-room to scoot on by after placing an order and waiting in the back..waited no more than ten minutes in a SUPER CROWDED place. I had the classic with American cheese, onions and lettuce on mine..it was well worth it! The fresh, hot, deliciousness when biting upon this sandwich was well worth the claustrophobic area with 50 people inside! As previously mentioned this is reasonably priced and will return here when I come back to Philly in a year!"}, {"review_id": "O0Ga1bnzVr9oqGTCm-w7BQ", "user_id": "eG1Tur78lGPRLPysNSzadQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "D'alessandro's is absolutely legit. A no nonsense small corner joint serving up huge, soft hoagies filled perfectly tender and juicy beef. Actually filled is an understatement. These things pack a load of meat. The toppings are numerous. While most places are traditionalist, D'alessadros gives you the freedom to add all types of extras. The fried onions add the perfect balance of sweet and crunch. Ok I have a confession that hopefully won't get me shunned: the first cheesesteaks I ever had in Philly were at....Pat & Geno's. In my defense, I knew they were tourist traps before I made the leap. But sometimes you do things for the sake of ticking the box on the bucket list. For what it's worth, those were terrible cheesesteaks. Easy to see why this is a Philly fav: Super speedy service, fair prices, and food quality beyond reproach.

I stick to provolone with onions but they have lots of options (Whiz, sauce, chicken cheesesteaks, etc). The service was great and you can tell lots of people are regulars here.

Large Amoroso roll, including a plentiful portion of well seasoned chopped high quality steak, fried onions, peppers, and all the fixings you can think of. This place does it RIGHT!

Got myself a whiz wit and left with my stomach full and one of the best cheesesteaks in the area...hands DOWN! Sandwich came in a soft roll which I believe was from ambrosos, and if you don't know what that is, it's got a reputation around the area and rightfully so as the top bread rolls. The hot cheese whiz made the sandwich irresistible, with that gooey cheese. Meat is diced finely and a healthy portion of rib eye. Service was fast and it gets packed in there, so I'm happy with the turnover time. Little bit of a hike since it's in the outskirts of the city, but def worth the trip."}, {"review_id": "QuKHc_lnaXY0XZxxfiNB2w", "user_id": "efoFHUP08msKW73LPkZxWA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "I really really really wanted to like this place.

I was so excited to try this cheese steak that every.single.one.of.my.friends RAVED ABOUT. I take one bite of the steak and....IT IS SO BLEND AND WHAT IS UP WITH THE ONION? I was so disappointed. I ended up putting crap load of pepper and eating it. I don't want to discredit this local restaurant AT ALL because I think at the end of the day, this place is famous for a reason right?
