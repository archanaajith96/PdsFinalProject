It was perfectly made and that herb butter spread put it over the top. I enjoyed every second of it. The place as a whole is super clean with a great atmosphere. Workers are all genuinely nice and helpful. Too bad i'm only in town for business but this place will surely become a required stop during any future trips to Anchorage."}, {"review_id": "p6HTd_MvHTKBhu8ADISYQg", "user_id": "PcgtOrx8nNChB__ccEPPDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Yeah, it's a chain, but it's a rare chain that manages to cultivate a little of that \"local vibe\" we all crave.I don't eat much bread these days (low carb diet, long story), but I often fantasize about the bread here.I mainly used to come here for the sandwiches.

Fresh bread that you can taste test, the employees are very friendly and helpful, and you cannot beat the quality and taste. I had the roast beef and provolone on Asiago sour dough bread. My husband had the Bacon and Egg breakfast sandwich. We also took home fresh baked salted caramel cookies and cinnamon rolls. Full and very happy!"}, {"review_id": "0w937R8Qzmhf1XK9UrO4Og", "user_id": "ctWAuzS04Xu0lke2Rop4lQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 - # 68/100If I have to live on bread alone, I'd choose to be stranded inside GHBC. I've seen their ad when I was in LA and bookmarked it as one of my places to visit while in Anchorage, AK. Located on Benson Blvd. past Denali St. this place bakes bread daily and most of their loaves get sold out sometimes even before the end of the day. Employees are upbeat and welcoming, offering huge slices of bread to taste. You can choose from whatever is on the bread board, or even if there's another kind you'd request for a taste, they'd happily slice a piece for you. I have a sweet tooth so I ranked my faves accordingly. So far I've had the Cinnamon chip and it is my number one, followed by white chocolate cherry, then cinnamon swirl, fourth is the cheese garlic, followed by Parmesan Basil rustic, and lastly Woodstock. The last one is a whole grain bread with nuts. It was good with a smear of butter. Love this place, hopefully on my next visit I'll be able to check out their sandwiches."}, {"review_id": "3qV3LApiMBDCMEYyd_PJWQ", "user_id": "WENuF0uX5MwKa--iedoSMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Why get a tiny salty almost stale loaf of bread at the local grocery store when you can have this stuff!!!

The store is clean, bright, and well-organized, there's a good amount of seating space, and of course you can get a generous sample from one of the breads they have for the day. There are many bread varieties, both sweet and savory, as well as other goodies like cookies and cinnamon rolls.Unsurprisingly, Great Harvest gets crowded during lunch (12:00pm-1:00pm especially). You may have to wait a while if you order a sandwich, but I think they usually come out in a reasonable amount of time. The only reason I don't give them five stars is the prices of the sandwiches are pretty high. Most of the sandwiches are $10 minimum for a whole (you can buy halves as well), and you have to pay an extra dollar for specialty bread. The sandwiches end up costing more than most of the loaves of bread which doesn't make sense. Thankfully, you can get a punch card that gives you a free loaf of bread or sandwich after 12 purchases, and sandwiches do count for punches (at least the whole ones do).Price aside, the sandwiches are delicious. The ingredients are fresh and they have a good variety of meats, vegetables, and cheeses. The fresh baked bread is the icing on the cake, so to speak. The sandwiches are quite hearty and filling so I can often get buy eating one half for lunch and saving the other half for later.I can't come here too often for the sake of my wallet and my waistline, but it is a nice treat once in a while. If you have a carb craving you'll find something to satisfy it here."}, {"review_id": "ESsA8abiZqqv34aRte2lUw", "user_id": "4qdmAKOx6gfhcIWZUGKxng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/16/2017", "text": "I found out about this place from a news article from Insider & APPARENTLY it's local to anchorage.Had to cum thru. Well they give you a free sample of a screw ton of random breads they got for the day in the front counter. Along with butter & honey to slather on em. Honestly I didn't even buy bread I just asked for a big ass sample of cinnamon chip & purchased myself some coffee. The ambiance is awesome. Better then some bs basic $tarbucks Y U C K. I sat down with my bread sample and coffee. Read the Anchorage paper. Finished my joe. Got another free sample of yummy bread. And drove eating MORE bread lol.So yea in a nutshell. Yum. Who doesn't like free samples lol.

This was our first visit. The minute we walked through the door we were offered a slice of bread. We tried the cinnamon chip and white chocolate cherry. Both of them were really good and warm. Slathered on a little butter and looked at the menu. We ordered three sandwiches and a loaf of the cinnamon chip bread. (It's so soft! Not too sweet and perfect for French toast!) All three sandwiches are pictured. Two hot and one cold. I had the Alaska chicken. It's like a fancy zesty chicken salad with a hint of sweet. Super good. Seeing as it was our first visit we didn't know what bread went with what, so the girl at the register gave us some suggestions. I took her advice and boy am I glad I did. All of us smacked and gobbled down our choices so greedily we didn't get a chance to taste each other's selections. As far as cleanliness goes, compared to every other establishment I've gone to here it's the cleanest. I understand the snow and ice and mud can weather a place down and I've had to get used to the fact that not every restaurant will be squeaky clean. I felt like I was back in Eugene again. It's so bright and well lit, not cramped, with tables to sit and benches to wait. The customer service was amazing and the food was so good. This will definitely be one of my go to places while I'm living here!"}, {"review_id": "YfWpzoZWJM9z86kRGzbOJg", "user_id": "oz-OCgV3XUY3yTgGsyEcUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "Great selection of fresh bread and a gread spot for a hearty sandwich!"}, {"review_id": "xQ8p7mfVblIj59tW4odd5A", "user_id": "3MAfVdNv_obiutN1zN2WpA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "The peanut butter chocolate bread is terrible.

When I came in, I was offered a sample which I tried but I am extremely disappointed to realize that they charged me more than the $8.75 price listed on their board and website. I also wasn't offered a receipt, so not sure why I was overcharged so much. This bread was already a treat because it's so overpriced - regardless of us being in Alaska.
