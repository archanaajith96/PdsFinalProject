I've been let down one too many times with places that receive over-the-top reviews, but failed to deliver. This is not that place. First, the tea leaf salad. I was hesitant to even order this. I mean, it's a salad, so freakin what? But it was wonderful! Very light and refreshing, and I loved the contrasting flavors.We then split the Oh Noh Kauswer (coconut chicken) soup, and mint chicken. The soup was AMAZING. Honestly, the best I've had. I would return solely to have this again. The mint chicken was just delicious and spicy. Yes, there is usually a line, yes there are so many other places to choose from on this street alone.

My cousin has been raving about this place and I finally had the opportunity to enjoy the awesomeness that is Burma Superstar. If you're a foodie, this place is for you! So come hungry! I heard that they get mad busy around lunch time, so I was a bit nervous as I made my way over past opening time (opened at 11:30). I got there and was shocked there was not a line out the door. In fact, we would have been seated earlier had we been a party of 2 and not 3. I tested out the Yelp functionality of adding myself to the wishlist (first time doing this! Won't be my last). We were seated in 15 minutes. That gave us time to enjoy the people watching on the benches outside and they have free tea. The inside is pretty small. They sat us at a teeny tiny table for 2, but we were so ready for lunch we didn't even care. My concern was mainly around deciding what I wanted to eat and figuring out how we were going to fit all the food we wanted on the table. But not to worry! We made it work! Here's the run down of the food, don't judge us! We go hard. Thai iced tea: honestly, was not impressed. It was not really flavorful. But not to worry because I ordered a back up drink! Fresh ginger lemonade: SOOOO GOOD. Chicken Samusas: the sauce is killer. The flavor in these are really good and different from Indian Samosas I've had. Spicy crispy chicken: this is so delicious. It's the perfect combination of tang and spice. Just enough garlic in there to not overpower, but seals the deal! Deep fried string beans: OMG THE BEST STRING BEANS OF MY LIFE. So much flavor with the garlic and the chili sauce. Such a clutch decision to order! Walnut shrimp: really good but not fried like the ones I usually have. Honestly, was so full by the time this came I didn't have much of it. But the portion was massive! Burmese style fried rice: the texture was a bit unique and there wasn't a whole ton of flavor unless you put some of the sauce from other dishes. Lots to choose from! So again, come hungry! The portions are large."}, {"review_id": "N7Fu30NwmTTkEu9WxSAp8A", "user_id": "zCldSfeKfwosgpvNC1il6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "There's honestly no greater love I have than Burma Superstar... and I ain't exaggerating. Great service, great food, long line - all marks of a restaurant to stay for a long azz time. - TEA LEAF and MANGO salads - must gets, everything blends so well together and the server asks if you've had the tea leaf salad and explains the components and starts the mixin'- MANGO CHICKEN - the tanginess of the mango brings out the flavor of the chicken - WALNUT SHRIMP - the preparation is a bit unexpected; the shrimp are fried and there's sauce in the middle which is not like an Asian way of doing the dish by any means, but it's DELISH - BUN TAY KAUSWER - pretty spicy not gonna lie, but really delicious. I also would rec GARLIC NOODLES which is not too oily and has the right amount of citrus to still have the garlic flavor come thru- EGGPLANT & TOFU CURRY as well as the SESAME TOFU - great alternatives if you don't want meat and the way they prepare their eggplant is not soggy by any means FOR VEGETARIANS: i met with my cousins one time and one of them was a vegetarian, so highly recommend the samusa soup - fills you up and is just nice to have on a colder night!** GET THE COCONUT RICE, it goes with everything and the coconut is so damn fragrant.

Curiosity got the best of me. I checked on Yelp and found it to be very popular among the locals. Fast forward to today, we finally got the chance to see what the hype is all about. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed! We got some input from our waiter and of course my favorite source, Yelp. We ordered the Tea Leaf salad, Platha and dip, Fiery chicken and pork with pickled mango curry all with a side of Jasmine rice. The Platha and dip is a deep fried layered bread served with a coconut curry sauce. It was over fried and became a hard oily mess. Dipping into the sauce helped soften the bread but didn't win me over. Tea leaf salad had a beautiful presentation. It has a fermented paste mixed with crunchy nuts, seeds and fresh lettuce. The fermented taste was a turn off. However, the redeeming factors are the nuts and seeds which gave it a nice crunchy texture that was quite pleasing. The salad overall isn't bad but I couldn't get over the fermented taste. The Fiery Chicken bear resemblance to Panda Express Kung Pao Chicken. It's savory with a bit of a kick from the dry chilis. The best dish out of all that we tried today! Pork with pickled mango curry was the most interesting. I have never had pickled mango in any soup or stew. It had a turmeric flavored broth much like an Indian curry. The pork and potatoes were nice and tender. The dish was ok. The good thing about this dining experience is that the service was friendly and attentive. Ambiance was casual and was reasonably priced. With over 6,000 reviews, I went in with high expectation. The flavors were subpar and nothing impressive. Having said all this, I would like to pay it another visit in the impending future as there were many other interesting items on the menu I'd like to try."}, {"review_id": "NUEK3TddbIC2aS3QRP19aw", "user_id": "oKJevuXAzmARhDnjau0-TQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Burma Superstar doesn't really need another amazing review but here it is anyway.Burma Superstar is awesome.

They have this convenient texting system in place that texts you when your table is ready. Thankfully, we checked in a little early with the helpful and pleasant host at the front and found that we could be seated 15 minutes earlier than expected.Since it was a special occasion and it would be awhile till we would come back, we ordered a few of the most popular dishes and one that a Burmese friend recommended: Tea Leaf Salad, Oh Noh Kauswer, Classic Burmese Chicken and Shrimp Casserole, and the Coconut Rice.The Tea Leaf Salad: flavorful (slightly tangy, nutty, and refreshing). The $12 salad can feed two.5/5The Oh Noh Kauswer: A little too creamy for my taste (was really expecting a soup and not a curry). I enjoyed the mixture of spice and coconut flavor, however, and the purple onion helped balance the creaminess of the \"soup.\" The chicken was tender and flavorful from absorbing the spicy coconut broth. The crunchy wonton pieces on the top added a nice finish. The noodles were enough for two people (if you're not planning to order too much on the side)4/5Classic Chicken and Shrimp Casserole: Wow I LOVED the shrimp. First of all, they peeled the shrimp. They PEELED the SHRIMP! I've been to too many restaurant where they deep fry the entire shrimp, shell and all (eh). The shrimp was plump and juicy while the breading was perfectly crispy. The chicken was okay. It tasted slightly marinated in some type of soy-sauce based seasoning. It was nice to have it fall off the bone, however, since it was so tender. The basmati rice that came with it was slightly herbal and lightly seasoned.3.5/5The coconut rice was well...coconut rice? I wasn't sure why so many were impressed by it? So I guess it gets a 4/5?The dishes we got were on average between $12~$19/plate.The service was superb. We had three different waiters/waitresses coming at us during the night, and all of them were professional and friendly. Many would show us what each ingredient was and how to properly enjoy each dish. It was kinda amazing, but their timing was impeccable. Every time we finished a dish, it took less than two minutes (literally) for them to bring the next dish. They were really observant and accommodating.The ambiance was nice: dim-lighting, cozy,clean, and thematic (the whole Burmese culture showed through the deco). Eh the only annoying thing were the two tables on each side of us that were loudly declaring that \"I've probably had more *** than anyone else in this room\" and comments along these lines...Not Burma Superstar's fault, but part of the experience...Anywho, our experience and the food at Burma Superstar were overall good!

The server will prepare and toss and serve the salad for you tableside with all of its wonderful, fresh ingredients (including squeeze the lemon to dress it). Another favorite of mine is the coconut rice, which does an excellent job of complementing the savory, hearty rice flavor with an ever-so-subtle sweet hint of coconut to liven up the taste. Other than the incredible tea leaf salad and the coconut rice, everything else is good not great. There are many curry and beef dishes that are on par with many other good restaurants in San Francisco.

Sweet but not too sweet/overpowering, perfect with any one their other entrees Burmese Style Beef Curry- Very tasty and comforting! Meat was tender.

Was. Amazing!  The lamb was perfectly tender and flavorful, and cooked well so that it didn't have that typical gamey lamb taste.  The spices and chili peppers used in this dish were like a punch in the mouth - bursting with flavor and packing a nice heat (although I would have liked it spicier!)  If you come here, you HAVE to get this - best dish we tried by far!Fiery Chicken (4/5): This was almost as good as the Chili Lamb.  Almost.  The chicken was perfectly tender and I enjoyed the stir-fried vegetables, which added a nice crunch.  The sauce and spices, much like the Chili Lamb, added another great dimension to this dish.  My only complaint - if you're gonna call it \"Fiery,\" I'm expecting it to be SPICY!  My 70 year old Mom wasn't even breaking a sweat!Coconut Rice (5/5): Yeah I know what you're thinking.  \"Whaaat, Eric, you're rating RICE as 5 stars?\"  Hey, I'm Chinese and I love my carbs, what can I say.  The Coconut Rice here is so fluffy and has just a subtle touch of sweetness from the coconut milk.  It also has a strong coconut flavor without being overpowering - and it complements the spiciness and savory flavors of the Chili Lamb/Fiery Chicken PERFECTLY.  It was so good we ordered two trays of the Coconut Rice!  (and I ate 80% of it... carb loading for a marathon is my excuse)OVERALL: 5/5.  If you find yourself in a similar situation as me with only one restaurant in San Francisco to eat at, you can't go wrong with Burma Superstar!  The food was delicious and had lots of amazing flavors and spices.  My first time eating Burmese food but definitely not my last - count me a fan!"}, {"review_id": "DgFkuB9G7BJIZLMYj4MNRQ", "user_id": "kKTcYPz47sCDH1_ylnE4ZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "To say that I fell madly in love with Burma Superstar and Burmese food generally at Burma Superstar is a complete understatement.  I fell head-over-heels-crazy-in-love with Burmese food here.  If I lived in SF, I would visit this place EVERY SINGLE WEEK (at least once a week).  Since visiting this restaurant, I've sought out and eaten at every Burmese restaurant in the metro DC area.  This is how powerful and lovely and wonderful this restaurant is!  It is the BEST restaurant I visited in 2017 (hands down) and I cannot stop singing accolades about this place.  It is simply perfection.  We visited for lunch during our trip to SF in May 2017 and loved the experience!  Even during a weekday lunch, they were PACKED and we had to wait a few minutes (totally worth it). Once we got to our table, we started ordering several dishes, ALL PACKED WITH FLAVOR. OMG. We ordered the following:-Tea Leaf Salad (peanuts, fried garlic, sunflower seeds, sesame, lemon, tomatoes, fermented tea leaves, etc).  This is a signature Burmese dish and was beyond extraordinary here.-Samusa (beef)-SuperStar Noodle Salad (Burmese noodle salad with bean thread noodles, tofu, cucumbers potatoes, papaya, chili sauce, fried onions, and cabbage)-Steak Kebat (Wok tossed steak with onions, tomatoes, green chilies, and mint leaves).  Ok, this dish was an absolute game changer for me in 2017.  It's the reason I crave beef now. It's the reason I fell in absolute love with this place.  I cannot stop thinking about this dish and I have sought it out in so many places!! -Sesame Beef (strips of beef lightly fried with a sweet and tangy sauce; topped with sesame seeds).-Coconut Rice (SO perfect!  It wasn't too sweet or overpowering.  It was just perfect).Absolutely perfect!!!
