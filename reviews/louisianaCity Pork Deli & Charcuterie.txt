I highly recommend City Pork's BBQ. So there I was standing in front of a sign with a pig standing on a knife,  thinking about the sandwich I was going to order and then I walked inside. The smell is Sauce! The smell is Wood. The menu is plentiful for a carnivore.  I had a pulled pork sandwich called \"the big pig\" and it stands up to its name. It's at least 1/2#, if not more, of pulled pork that's is both firm yet yielding. Smoky but also piggy. Fantastic. They serve it dry. Or maybe lightly sauced with a bottle of their City Pork sauce that you can pour on. That sauce is slightly spicy but not hot. It's flavorful!  Baked bean side was huge !!  It also had smoked bacon that was there's in large chunks. Great accompaniment. !!  Ice tea to wash it down. And I'm back on the road. ILL BE BACK!!"}, {"review_id": "0eJf3NMGzc2hVpMppArdzg", "user_id": "BOmM0ce6_ek_9PlpYV24Rg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Absolutely LOVE this place! We (the fiance' and I) always enjoy the Friday night \"all you can eat\" events where we can get out, have top-notch food and experience new dishes and tastes. There's always something different and everything is cooked to absolute perfection. We always choose local eateries over chains as often as possible and we are truly enjoying making this a \"Friday night date\" event as ofent as possible. There is certainly bang for your buck and such delicious food."}, {"review_id": "SPXjVglDZhZ67L0aSWHbDw", "user_id": "TipdWsV3k1gSfwMB6ZNEVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "One of my favorite brunch places in Baton Rouge! The cashiers and staff are always friendly and knowledgeable. The food is always delicious - The Hangover, Grits Bowl, French Toast, BELT Sandwhich. EVERYTHING. It did take us awhile to get our food but the cashier came to our table to let us know they were short staffed and apologized for the delay. He also offered us a bacon and chocolate chip cookie for our troubles (which we took and was also delicious).

Excellent brisket and pork. Portions are substantial but not huge. Their sauce is thin, sweet, and tangy with a mild heat. The brioche bun for the brisket sandwich was delicious, as are the pickles. Sides: potato salad is excellent, bbq beans are delicious but different: if you're looking for classic bbq style beans go elsewhere. I wanted a bit more from the house made chips, though: many of them were tough like they'd spent time under a heat lamp and even the crisp ones were lacking in flavor. THIS IS NOT YOUR GRANDMA'S TEXAS BARBEQUE, so if you go in expecting huge portions of predictable flavors, you're gonna have a bad time. Overall, we'll be back."}, {"review_id": "8T39VI7GfYK-821jh0BlsA", "user_id": "0pTkjr5QYjpOCixKNs051Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Went for brunch with my family yesterday.

We came at around 3 and was met with a pretty confused counter service- aka they didn't know when happy hour really was, didn't know how to make the drinks etc. All good though- they figured it out. We ordered the burger and the 3 meat bbq combo.  Food arrived lightning quick which tells me that they have the meats waiting to be served as oppposed to reaching into their smoker and cutting it fresh. Brisket was passable, but was clearly served from a warming tray that had been left sitting in sauce. Not really my idea of good brisket. I want nice thick barky slices- not thin roast beef. Flavor was smoky but again- just lazy serving style. Maybe they don't have the volume to justify fresh slices- but it was a fail. Ribs were fatty and quite tough- i know good bbq aren't supposed to fall off the bone- but there was no discernible smoke ring and you were left gnawing on gristle and fat. Mac and cheese was bland and flat and the cheesy potatoes were forgettable.  Burger was ok- nice bun- but the meat itself was thin and steamed as opposed to charred. It was again clear that these patties are formed before hand and did not deliver that charry grilled bite that you're looking for. On top were some ok sauteed onions- but the whole thing was just very meh. If you want to know what a good burger looks and tastes like- try chimes- they cook it to order-   Drinks were fine- but don't think i'll be back. If you're gonna be a bbq place, nail that- if you're gonna be a charcuterrie place- nail that- but shooting for average in all directions makes austin a dull boy.  next."}, {"review_id": "MKGXjl90IFfTeaq9gaqQ4Q", "user_id": "p3WgkX2d-4ZhF0NHULXo6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "I came here for brunch with a few friends and it was such a great experience. The menu is unique to the restaurant and they incorporate their famous BBQ into the majority of their breakfast/brunch items. We started with a block of hogshead cheese that you can purchase from the deli fridge. It was absolutely amazing. It's made in house so it's super fresh. Yum! I got the Texas melt (add bacon, because bacon) with a side of corn grits. The size of the sandwich was surprising large for a brunch portion, as I couldn't even begin to munch on the second half. Hooray leftovers! In addition to great food, there was NO LINE! We were able to order right away and our food came out pretty fast.

The cashier was very friendly and knowledgeable, giving us recommendations. We order our food to go and she gives us our coke from the cooler. We sit down to wait and read ome of the free magazines from the stand. The cashier brings us some delicious spicy cheddar cheese while we wait. We notice we have been waiting a suspiciously long time - Like 30 minutes. The cook comes out and starts asking the cashier questions about the order. Saying things that make it obvious he has not even started making it. I was ready to just say we were going to leave but my friend really wanted to try the sandwich he ordered. So we kep waiting and the cashier comes and apologizes and says that the cooks were switching shifts and the cook that left 10 minutes earlier just decided he didnt want to stay and make it but didnt tell the new cook about the order. Disappointed with the overall in store experience but i have to say, the cashier had great customer service and the food was good."}, {"review_id": "sZz9PhyAsj2kWfh6P7HWEQ", "user_id": "ove7z1hTlip9rwGRrzsuyg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/15/2017", "text": "**Follow up: the pulled pork was delicious!

Cuban was good. Fried Mac n cheese balls were ok. Not delicious. We were underwhelmed for the $50+ spent.

My girl ordered the Cubano sandwich (Good) and we both shared the Pork Nachos (I recommend this because it was the best thing). Overall we had a great experience and the staff was great.
