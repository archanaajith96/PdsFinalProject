The barbecue is pretty good - I always judge a place on its salad and dreamland has a solid bbq salad. They also have a couple enjoyable sides like homemade potato chips and onion dip and fried okra. The location is good, right in downtown, near the river front. The atmosphere is casual, though they have wait staff so it's not a \"hole in the wall\" type of bbq joint. Best of all, they brew the old Railyard beers...or they are Railyard now. Not sure. Either way, a good selection that can please most crowds. Prices are very good - $10 for a big salad with lots of meat. $5-7 for beers."}, {"review_id": "A5iF7FrdBPkbXh8KrfQ6Ng", "user_id": "b6cc6aggKSCiIoCDLP2GpA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Cool place. Got excited when I saw the smoke stack. This place was pretty good. I've been to many BBQ places around the country so although I give it 3 stars, it's not a bad thing. It's just that I've had better in many other places. Menu was good. Pork and chicken only. No beef choices if you're looking for beef. Not the place. Ribs had a nice smoke taste to them.  They didn't fall off the bone but they had a decent pull to them. They were a little tough but too bad. Pulled pork was a little dry to me. Had a decent taste. Their smoked sausage was great. I'd recommend that if you come here. Had a great snap when you bite. Baked beans was good. Nothing special but a nice compliment.  And the Potato Salad was excellent. All in all. It's a good place to come and have a great dinner with your family and friends. Not the best BBQ I've had but still really good."}, {"review_id": "WqZ3KsRA2oo9hrGurTsyNQ", "user_id": "dIWD89dHoC_rmnjNw5m3eQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Dreamland barbecue restaurant nested in the center of downtown Montgomery. There is very little to no parking because it is so busy. We ended up parking in a parking garage about 2 to 3 blocks away. The restaurant was very crowded in the wait for a table was about 40 minutes. Now I should've prefaced this with we had a group of close to 20.  So in retrospect, the wait wasn't really that bad. One seeded we were sitting in the middle of the restaurant and the ambience was definitely that a barbecue place. There were so many people there though it was hard to see everything.All the staff in the restaurant we're genuinely happy to see us. Unfortunately, with the table the size that we had they only assigned us one waiter, which was definitely not enough and he was overworked. He missed a few of our orders and then the wait time for the food was even longer. I do not blame the waiter (per se) because management should've assigned at least one other server.We ordered lot of different dishes pretty much one of everything on the menu (a slight exaggeration, but not by much). I ordered the big daddy nachos (which were not so big at all) and need to ultimate bar-b-que combo plate (ribs, sausage, and barbecued pork) with mac & cheese and fried okra as my sides. The ribs were outstanding no doubt about it, the sausage was good, and the pork was more like chopped pork with some sauce (not my favorite). Both of the sides were also good and I would order those again.Overall, the barbecue was good, but not great (I'm a Texan we love our barbecue!). I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for good ribs, like I said they were outstanding."}, {"review_id": "a3IQ_I4C1IvxVrc9tjwoeg", "user_id": "AJQTXsWoOMZRmDIbRUZ4Ag", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Ribs and banana pudding were excellent!

I really love the chicken here. It has a nice smoked chicken flavor. The service was quick. It is one of the better BBQ restaurants to go to in AL for those with food allergies, because they do not put soy sauce in their red BBQ sauce.

The ambience was excellent  and the place was full. We ordered the  two and three meat combo, which comprised of ribs, chicken and sausage. The food had no flavor. The ribs were cooked on an open fire with no seasoning. The sauce was a lifesaver, even though it didn't help. Even the cold slaw was bad. They just poured it out the bag no mayo or anything to give it flavor. I must admit the service was great and the waitress was very nice, she even bought a sampling of their banana pudding, which was horrible .  A message to the cook season your meat and you can make millions, learn how to make southern banana pudding and it will be a hit.
