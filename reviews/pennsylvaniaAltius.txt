Service is top notch and while the restaurant is very busy, you'll feel as though you're the very important guest in the room. I chose the cauliflower steak for dinner and before you eye roll me - wait. Altius absolutely nailed it and if you can imagine that much detail being given to vegetable based dishes, imagine what they are doing to your steak. I'm not sure what is more beautiful...the view or the dreams I've had of my dinner ever since.  You'll be treated to a tasting of popcorn at your table. I didn't even know I liked (ok...love) truffle popcorn, but I do. I'm now obsessed with it and you will be too. Only visit Altius if you want a dinner experience that will delight you and a truffle popcorn obsession to follow."}, {"review_id": "5ZIHIJ-MCA2PY5iDSMAM8A", "user_id": "GSMFNKyjgfuG5Cxw3B5HLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Boy, was I oblivious of how great Pittsburgh is! It was a short trip, nonetheless, well lived. They have so much to offer besides all the Steelers Fanatics! If you are visiting, this review is for you. If you are a local, this review will make you proud. Now, I will say...I am Carolina Panthers Fan, but the boyfriend is a huge Patriots Fan....so I hope he doesn't read this, but can your Steelers please maintain the Super Bowl Record (it is a Tom Brady/deflated ball/ and the Carolina defeat in SB 2014 hate thing)?Anyway, back to the restaurant and Incline....take the incline to Altius, it s a $5 round trip. It is a must do, take your time to absorb the reason why they exist and why there are only two left from seventeen. I truly appreciate maintaining a part of history with its integrity. As you walk out of the Incline station, Altius is to your right. Very short walk. I promise, I could have been eating a cup of noddles and been super happy. The views make you have that feeling, as you are basically overseeing the entire city, all three rivers, the stadium and the incline. Although Altius wins for location already, their food wasn't short. They live up to their name, high standards for sure. The food is great. Everyone enjoyed every bit of it. They have several caviar options and a great craft cocktail selection. The service was so professional. Our sever knew each dish in and out.

We came here on a Saturday night for dinner to celebrate a birthday. They won't guarantee window seats, but as others have said, each floor of the  restaurant is pretty small, so you have a nice view from any table. We however, somehow lucked out and scored the corner table!I had very high expectations for the food here, and while it was good, it didn't quite live up to the hype.I started with the lobster bisque, which was delicious! It's all puréed so it's very smooth and creamy without any chunks chunks of lobster. As my main I had the duck. I really liked the sides that accompanied it, but the duck itself was tougher and less flavorful than I expected.I found the food here to be very heavy, and not in a pleasantly full way, but more of a I never want to eat again way. My dinner partners felt the same, so much so that none of us had room for dessert, and we ALWAYS have room for dessert.Nevertheless, as we were celebrating a birthday, they brought out a lovely plate of chocolate and truffles. Definitely tell them if you are celebrating an occasion!Overall, the view is amazing and the service is top notch. The food is very good, but for the price I would have expected it to be better. If I were to go back, I would likely skip the appetizers (or at least share with someone), order a different main, and try out their dessert menu"}, {"review_id": "MyNkfuhmouum_VeRlxi1xQ", "user_id": "IOXQOxexcp_UJ_3izfnZBQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "ALTIUS is a panoramic restaurant on the top of Mount Washington, a large Hill looking over Pittsburgh. It's a very elegant place over two stories with 180* glass bays. Service is very good. The view is excellent, but over Pittsburgh of course. The wine list is interesting and not too pricy. Appetizers are affordable but main course are really expensive ($40 to $56). Quality of that food ranges from average to good. Too ritch. Desserts way too sweet as sadly this is the case in most places in America where \"harmonious sugar balance\" seems not to have sinked yet. Clearly it's more a place I would recommend for the view than for the plates as it's good but no more than that."}, {"review_id": "H2qufvs0skBjwK0ZGhW9CQ", "user_id": "ktUxDtUAtoc3fgCopW9LLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Altius sits atop Mt.

The entire meal was delicious, and unlike some fancy restaurants, we left feeling very full & satisfied. Pricey but absolutely worth every penny.Our feast included:- Complimentary truffle popcorn (so good!)- Lobster bisque (amazing, served in a really neat way tableside)- Complimentary one-bite mini \"pancake\" with champagne cream and caviar (a nice treat)- Gourmet bread with honey butter & sun-dried tomato pesto (possibly the best part)- Duck and filet mignon (pretty good and fantastic, respectively)- Complimentary birthday chocolate truffles (lovely, though they did come after our waitress asked if we wanted dessert, and we thought the special occasion had been forgotten -- but it hadn't been!)- Complimentary chocolate chip cookie bars to go in cute little bagsCan't recommend this place enough. Make sure you dress appropriately, have money for the valet, and make a reservation! The Duquesne Incline is right next door too, definitely worth checking out after your meal."}, {"review_id": "0dFxjfmp66OqsBGtQtRq5A", "user_id": "6pPWq24LUX-GXYqaOuJdnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I came here for a one-year anniversary with my girlfriend and I can't think of another place that would have provided a better experience in the entire city.

We ended up having about 4-5 courses overall with free ranch popcorn, mini pancakes, and a range of different types of bread to start off (plus a complimentary cookie bar at the end). The lobster vanilla bean bisque was presented very nicely with it being constructed in front of you and contained a broad range of flavors from candied chestnut, to croutons, vanilla bean, and then the orange cream. Everything was very well balanced, and the Ora King Salmon may have been the best I've ever had. My girlfriend had the Duroc Pork Chop, which I was fortunately able to taste and I'm in disbelief how such a thick cut of meat could have so much flavor evenly distributed throughout. The purple mashed potatoes were a nice touch and seasoned well.

She was fantastic. Unfortunately, she and the view from Mt. W. were the saving grace of the evening.  View, services, atmosphere were all great, but I expected more for the food.Give them the benefit of doubt, it was Sunday and there was a big event happening, so maybe they were busy.Jumbo Lump Crab Cigar was alright. The crust was thick. The side dishes were really good, but the Crab Cigar itself was a bit let down. For a $19 starter, I guess I expected more crab meat and thinner shell? (king crab legs, maybe?)Entrées we had a $45 fish (forgot what it was) and $55 ribeye (21 days dry-aged).  The fish was so-so and the steak was fat and under-cooked. Should have just gone for scallops. I think the Brussel sprouts were over-cooked. (see photos)For desserts, we had White Chocolate Macadamia Ball. They ask you to video it, but honestly, it is not that video-worthy. Yes, hot sauce melts the chocolate ball. This is not 1997, just do it. Secondly, the table light is overhead and when you pour the sauce over the dessert, the hand casted a shadow over the ball. The lighting makes recording very difficult. Saw this happened to like 3 tables. Overall, I actually really enjoyed the evening.  5* for services, the view, the atmosphere. Maybe 3* for the food that night.  Certainly had better food at this place (it was a Thursday).  And will be back."}, {"review_id": "MbRp8uC6Vyg_WmGMv1S3TQ", "user_id": "qZeh_8N7YHosWTmEHkrypA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "A bougie place with a really great view on Mount Washington.

The restaurant is beautiful, the view is amazing, the service is good. Everything you want before you order dinner. Unfortunately, the menu is needlessly complicated with ill-pairing sauces and unnecessary ingredients. I'm not interested in how many items a restaurant can list on the menu's descriptions. I'd prefer restaurants which execute great taste while practicing restraint from the pantry and spice rack.Three additional reasons Altius received a 3* rating from me... which I rarely do since many people consider 3* to be poor.1. Everything was heavily over salted. One diner in our group sent their meal back for this reason. The rest of us dealt with it.2. No Italian red wines by the glass, in fact their wines by the glass were all together uninspiring.3. I want to see Altius up it's game.

A very unexciting, boring dish even for me who like Cauliflower a lot.  Not only lacked any combination of vegetables, it also lacked any flavors.

Altius is contemporary in decor with tables spaced comfortably apart. The service is attentive, friendly and efficient.  Both servers during my visits were extremely well informed about the menu and the chef's specials.  While enjoying a pre-dinner drink, a cone of flavored popcorn is delivered to the table.  Also before dinner arrived a shooter of soup was served in tiny glasses.  Deliciously warm on a single digit winter night. During our two visits we have enjoyed the Charcuterie, Salmon, Scallops and Allen Brothers beef.  Each entrée was prepared to perfection and delicious. Accompanying the check was a parting chocolate truffle - a nice touch.  Altius is an outstanding restaurant showcasing excellent food as well as a gorgeous view."}, {"review_id": "l7NmogPvtavMcUeDd2V3kQ", "user_id": "GvttvpDroFphQ8t_vYlJYw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "I stopped here for dinner a few weeks ago and must admit i wasn't overly impressed.

The lights kept flickering which made you feel like you were in a bad disco.  The tables were spaced nicely, so it didn't feel like you were on top of the table next to you; however, I will absolutely express my unhappiness with my seating arrangement. We were sat at the only table that required you to sit side by side, not across the table like most are use to. i felt completely disconnected from the person i was dining with because we were talking to the side of each others face. I understand that some people like that setup, but i do not. It completely ruined my experience here. I'm not blaming Altius, but it was a horrible night to go to a Mt. Washington restaurant because the view was masked by a thick cloud of fog. The wait staff was really kind and attentive. I ordered the only vegetarian option on the menu and honestly have no clue what the chef was thinking when s/he concocted it. I ordered the Cauliflower steak with cauliflower puree and pickled cauliflower. Certainly there are other vegetables that could have been incorporated that would've went along better. i love cauliflower, but a cauliflower trifecta was not satisfying."}, {"review_id": "b1Gf3e99v5ADEJDKJoPwOw", "user_id": "xLJhiR7QIbLTFWX6FzUQ7A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/4/2017", "text": "While visiting Pittsburgh, I discovered that this city has become a quite the foodie spot. The first place I visited was on a top of the Mt. Washington with a spectacular view of down town. The first floor had some simple interior, large windows, and lots of wines on the wall. It was actually nice and bright. Without much color or artwork, it was rather monochromatic and modern.We had a business dinner setup upstairs, so off we went. The upstairs seemed smaller than the downstairs, but it still had good amounts of seating. The windows were really  big here too, giving the customers a beautiful view from up above. And yes, the view was pretty amazing, you got to see the bridge, downtown, and even the tram called Duquesne Incline taking people up and down the Mt. Washington as well. Super cool! Since we were having a business dinner, they had a semi-secluded space, where it can be used as a private event area. The walls were made out of glass, so we still had a nice view of the outside and it did not obstruct from the natural light coming in and flowing throughout the dining area.I started with a cocktail called Missed Connection, very refreshing. It had nice strawberry and ginger flavor, and had nice sweetness to it. They brought out nice amount of complimentary bread for the table, three different kinds: dinner rolls, onion breads (?), and foccacia breads. I had their foccacia bread and it was super tasty! It was one of the best foccacia bread I've ever had!The dinner was pre-set, three course. I chose She Crab Bisque, Chilean Sea Bass, and Carrot Cake. They were all super fresh, high quality, and delicious. Much better than I expected. Full of flavor, very nicely plated, and I enjoyed them all.The staffs were really great, very patient with our large group. They were friendly, polite, and we were well taken care of.

A group of us made a reservation at Altius to celebrate a special event after hearing all the good things about this restaurant from a friend of ours. All of us aren't from Pittsburgh, so it's definitely a plus for a restaurant to be just a few steps away from another Pittsburgh's tourist spot like Duquesne Incline as well! The restaurant is also a popular spot, so make sure you make a reservation ahead of time. We were lucky to even snatch a table next to a window for early dinner, but even then our reservation was made a few months in advance.All of us ordered different dishes (I ordered duck breast) and, frankly, I was super happy with my food that I literally cleaned my plate (nothing left on my dish at all!). The duck done so perfectly that the skin was crisp but the meat still tender and it went well with the puree/vegetables (including an edible flower) that came with the dish. Best of all, the meat didn't smell or had awkward chewiness to it at all. I also tried other people's ribeye and lamb rack and thought the plate presentation was great and meats were cooked well (although I think the ribeye was slightly more towards medium vs. medium rare that we ordered). What I love also is that they have awesome complementary items such as fancy bread (to your choosing), complementary amuse-bouche (strawberry-pistachio mousse, house-flavored popcorn and truffle for you to try as well!Overall, a nice, upscale dining (and if you scored a table next to the window, with an awesome view, too!).
