The sushi chefs are so quick and creative. The restaurant gets very busy and can get packed during the lunch and dinner peak times. The hosts and hostesses are very spot on and have great customer service. Even though they are busy, they will still tend to you and get you what you need. There is no teppanyaki grill, they cook your food in the back of the kitchen. But the food experience is still awesome. Depending what day it is, they have sake or wines on special. There is also lunch specials for sushi and bento boxes. I love going here for the sushi. And they also have non-alcoholic drink specials like boba tea, Thai tea, and Hong king iced coffee. I love their drinks."}, {"review_id": "j17LgOameXbRE-vLqI9czA", "user_id": "9cJge8fOR-WoKPyS-g8lEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/24/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Would have gotten a 5, but no Teppan yaki and no bar drinks (only wine, beer and sake).  Good: The quality of food was AWESOME. If you are an avid sushi and hibachi eater, you'll be pleased. Sampled nigiri, sushi rolls and a steak and shrimp plate from hibachi. All fantastic. Bad: No bar or teppan."}, {"review_id": "KUnfpEaM4aX5QUveuw-CGw", "user_id": "O2Ik-AU7b3X-O1Mg8sJ64g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "I apologize for being late on my reviews. I decided to try this place out when I was in town last week for lunch. It was a very nice restaurant and very hidden. I had ordered the hibachi shrimp with the  dragon roll sushi. I enjoyed everything except for the yum yum sauce. It just had a different taste compared to other restaurants.

They also serve Ramen. The chashu is good though I hope that the eggs are prepared as Ajitsuke and not just hard boiled. Having said that, it is not their specialty but I think that they still serve the best Ramen in Montgomery. The Ramen from another Japanese restaurant is so bland and the chashu is more like bacon. The price is very reasonable! I will definitely come back! Please find a Ramen chef from Fukuoka and put up a separate ramen restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "YIHgXyPZUlple9qGWufwyw", "user_id": "iY7KU4ryy4ZpLNn6SLey4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "This is the best Japanese restaurant in this area! Tonight we had excellent experience here. I had sashimi regular and my wife had a Texas roll and AL roll, we also ordered Edamame and fried calamari for appetizers. Service is good and friendly. We had some miso soup before the meal. It was hot and very tasty. My sashimi tastes very fresh and portion is good. I also tried Texas roll, it is fantastic. After meal we ordered some tempura banana for dessert. My wife just love it. We had a good time there and we will definitely come back soon!"}, {"review_id": "nq1BzKHqDzIItNHozR7voQ", "user_id": "NxKSN9fLxvc4aU-DhgSgQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Always a big fan of sushi, got recommended by a friend from work.

The wait staff is always very nice, my daughter loves this place. They are helpful with suggestions on how to best enjoy your dishes in an authentic way. But also have dishes for people who are a little more trepidatious about sushi/Japanese food. My only complaint would be they need a little more light in the dining area, unless that has something to do with keeping the fish fresh."}, {"review_id": "3A8pOMBpZXGYR2Yvxmux2w", "user_id": "ljlelUeXkwhGUDlIi2OnvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Excellent sushi!

The waiter and waitress are very nice. I often order Texas roll, pink lady roll and golden nest roll. Rolls are made so creative. They also have some noodles, which taste great!

We had a new server who forgot about us. We got the baby octopus salad and the sushi love boat for 2. The baby octopus salad was good but some was still frozen. The server forgot our soup and salad until the boat came. At that point I only wanted soup and my husband only wanted salad. The boat was good. Fresh fish. Very tasty. We were even able to change out a roll that was a little more expensive for one we didn't want.

I can honestly say this place definitely lives up to their reviews. We order 2 chicken hibachi plates, 1 beef teriyaki and 1 chicken katsu.  Everything tasted great and authentic. We also received all the sauces for the tempura and gyoza that comes with the bentos.I'm originally from Hawaii and have been looking to find a Japanese food place that tastes like it does in Hawaii. Who knew I'd find it in Montgomery,  Alabama!!
