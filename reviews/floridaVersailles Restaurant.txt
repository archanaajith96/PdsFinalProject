The waiter didn't even address me, but instead talked to my friend in Spanish which I unfortunately could not understand. I ordered a Cuban sandwich which would have been good if it was hot, my french fries were also stone cold. When I asked the waiter for some french fries he just glared at me, didn't say a word and the fries were never seen again. My friend sad her food was good but also cold.The bakery on the other side of the building is worth going to for some delicious pastries to take home, just be prepared to wait!"}, {"review_id": "mieyr8GydQi_tp1aiZcA9g", "user_id": "wkklbFK50TTkd1GJXXAntA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Meh, I am not having much luck with the Cuban food here.  This was my third time ordering lechón and it also came out dry.  I need to stop ordering it.Dacquiri was delicious!"}, {"review_id": "gwOLEI8vrpFojTtj4ANHqg", "user_id": "uHAZD_jPIZxHZAz4qFFHyg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I had heard from a few UBER drivers that this was the go-to restaurant in Miami and was a must try. My experience here definitely did not disappoint, although I think my expectations coming in were much higher given the build up. Our group of 5 split a few different dishes to try a little bit of everything, but I think we all agreed that the paella was by far our favorite. It was perfectly seasoned and the broth that it was cooked in enhanced all the flavors in the dish. Their skirt steak with the chimichurri sauce was also really tasty and perfectly cooked. The ambience of the restaurant is good for families and groups, but I wouldn't come here if I was trying to have a romantic dinner with my significant other. It can get on the loud side because the place is so big and there are so many people that can fit into the restaurant. The only point of compliant I had was that it was FREEZING in the restaurant. We came in with our sundresses on after a day of sightseeing and the AC was blasting directly above our table. We asked our waitress to turn down the cold, which she did, but it was still pretty chilly for the remainder of our meal."}, {"review_id": "lVL6fqid-C9silYmRIss3A", "user_id": "C7qczjBIVlJaUmvSGJdoFA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "My group stopped here before our first day at Ultra. Apparently this restaurant has a lot of hype so you know us tourists had to make a stop. Still had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table of 5. Once we sat down I had to order a Cortadito. I ordered TWO of those lol.Croquette Sandwich (Ham/Cheese) - I wasn't a huge fan and slightly disappointed. The sandwich itself was too dry for me. I tried my bf's Cuban (I think it was the Our Famous Cuban Sandwich) but it tasted way better than mine. It had a lot more flavor and wasn't as drying. I kind of wish I ordered something with sauce/meat/rice. You can never have \"too much sauce\" ;)We also ordered the Cod Fish Fritters for appetizers and I do remember that was good!"}, {"review_id": "SkTAot7XXfPq4xpA8f9gjw", "user_id": "-S1KvpmUM8Sx60UimmufxA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Following the Marlins game on Easter Sunday, Versailles Restaurant jumped out at me on Yelp.I first want to comment on the service. It was top rate. I was able to get seated right away, the waiter was very attentive, and he was focused on quick service. From taking the order to delivering the goods, I was very pleased.The steak I ordered was perfect. It melted in my mouth. It had a good flavor to it. Very satisfying. The dessert, a chocolate cake, totally hit the spot. It was a good experience, and I'm glad that I made my way to the place, which is one of the more popular places to eat in Little Havana.I'm certainly looking forward to trying other items on the menu."}, {"review_id": "gxcxVBfN_hSNkP4EmPK-BQ", "user_id": "4x1k8wmK9O597YB4W1nnbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "High trafficked, touristy but large portions, reasonable prices and friendly service.

I think I would have enjoyed it more if it had a bit of spice to make it more memorable. Sangria- We ordered a pitcher which was plenty for 3 people! The sangria was delicious, sweet and had a good amount of fresh fruit!

The best part is it's affordable. I've been here several times and keep coming back. It's a relaxed atmosphere and almost a dinner type feel. No need to dress up. They do have a small live band/group I think on the weekends which was nice. The staff that I have had has always been good and friendly but usually Spanish is their first language. I think this adds to the atmosphere and they still speak good English. The food...this is the star...it is awesome...I usually get the imperial rice which has chicken in it. It is really really good. I've had other menu items such as the ropa vieja and others...all have been excellent. For desert we had tres leches which was great as well. I got the sangria which I  used to think was great...it's still good but I think after having sangria in Barcelona nothing really compares...I'm now tainted I guess...it's still good...I've also tried the mango daqueri which was really good and made with fresh fruit.For the prices and quality alone, this place is easily a 5 star!"}, {"review_id": "vDsbZHyt_l0C0OjeyuQnyw", "user_id": "5BpJEC8YVi80ecWT5CtlfQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "A must stop for Cuban food when you're in Miami!  The line may look long but don't worry the restaurant is huge with a quick turnaround (plus you can get a snack at the bakery if you're hungry)---yuca fries: a yummy crispy side to share---ropa vieja: so delicious!!

This place is so popular you can see myriad of tourists and tour buses dropping unsuspecting tourists at this place every day.This place is so not the it, it may have been at one time, but it's not anymore. My God this place was borderline bland. I knew something was wrong the minute I walked in, all I saw were old Cuban's whos taste buds have diminished long ago and unsuspecting tourists.I ordered their calamari and fricasse chicken. This is the first Cuban restaurant I've been to where I wasn't served complimentary bread.The calamari came out way to fast, it had a deteriorated taste as if it had been sitting in the freezer to long. The dipping sauce was just grated tomatoes that weren't even grated well, it was truly pathetic.The fricassee wasn't that bad, but it seemed to have been spiced down for the unsuspecting tourists looking for \"authentic\" Cuban.The plantains looked like Jack the Ripper got a hold of them, and the rice was not presented uniformly. It looked like they just slapped my food on my plate and rushed it out to me.Even though they had myriads of servers and \"table watchers\" the service was spotty at best.My advice, don't waste your time at this place if you are looking for authentic Cuban, there are so many other good Cuban places around if you search."}, {"review_id": "3KlWQSgOwWzUFzdMoFnmZw", "user_id": "p5kO-OzEgA0EtdHSdzKUeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Most delicious  Cuban food  ever! This place lived up to its reputation (and exceeded its yelp rating of 4 stars...in my opinion this is easily 5 stars). It is located on  \"calle ocho\" (a famous Miami road for Hispanic culture).

The restaurant atmosphere is causal and not too stuffy, and the food is great. Portions are large and the price is low...what more can you ask for. I ordered the Ropa Vieja, my husband got the imperial rice  and my mom had the pollo ajillo. For dessert  we got the tres leches. Drinks included daiquiri and sangria. It was all on point.

The ambiance a bit stuffy, but not intolerable. Our server was pleasant. The food was good. I highly recommend the chicken, and odds are you won't be able to finish it because you'll be stuffed. Their beans and rice are okay. I tend to like black beans more. The chimchurri they use on their steaks etc., is refreshing and light. I was also impressed by the yucca. I had to snag I think it was the guava empanadas on the way out. Had to tend to the sweet tooth.

I was expecting lunch to arrive so I waited until they were finished serving breakfast. In the mean time, I ordered their cuban expresso and visited their bakery. I had their cheese rolls, potatoes meatballs, and guava rolls all equally amazing. For lunch M, I highly recommend getting their steak dishes especially the churrasco Versailles.

Food ordered:1) Calamari - The dish was rather cold and mushy..2) Ceviche Tropical - Usually I only order ceviche when its squid but surprisingly the fish went really well with the ceviche! It was super refreshing3) Classic sampler - white rice, yuca, fried plantains, ground beef (overall, I feel like this entree allows you to try everything so its a good place to start if you are overwhelmed by the options) 4) Criollo sampler - yellow rice, fried plantains, shredded beef with tomato sauce (I would probably choose this over the classic sampler. The meats have more flavor.)5) Special cuban sandwich - ham, pork, mustard, pickles (Meh.. I had better cuban sandwich before.
