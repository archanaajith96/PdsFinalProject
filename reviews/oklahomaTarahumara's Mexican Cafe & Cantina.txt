(And good flan is a great thing. Believe me -- food of the freakin' GODS.) Too bad I can't have it right now . . . damn keto diet and all.The mole here is excellent, too -- a traditional, northern Mexican mole Poblano. (Yup -- deep, nutty, rich, and cocoa-laden, with just enough spices to be piquant but not \"hot, hot, hot.\" The perfect savory dish for a cold evening. Comfort food, mija -- comfort food.)Great patio for warm weather dining.Expect long lines and loud fellow diners -- this isn't the place for quiet, intimate suppers, people."}, {"review_id": "A3qxxfKIAwn-iByU75nipQ", "user_id": "ts3PXAL80WgUNlsVGOkR4Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "Pros:-complementary queso-great fresh salsa-complementary mole-great food-tremendous serviceCons:-long wait-margaritas just okay-didn't care for atmosphere (personal preference, others may love)-no empanadas on the menu?!?! Blasphemy.I had the flautas and my boyfriend had the prime rib tacos. Mine was great and my boyfriend said he'd ordered better things off the menu from here. All in all I'd recommend this place. Only regret getting to full not to order dessert!

There was a short wait. However you could head up to the bar and get delicious drinks and a fantastic greeting from Jacqueline (as I did). I was blown away with professionalism and warm hospitality she offered. My drinks were made quickly and tasted oh so yummy. Once we got to the table the green sauce was super awesome and the salsa / cheese dip went down quickly as I couldn't get enough of it. We looked over the menu and wanted to split an entrée (Chicken fajita burrito)because we didn't want leftovers... however they explained the set-up charge .... I then ordered an a la carte item (chicken soft tacos)...no big deal. And we took a togo box home. (Jose our server) The service was lightning fast and I truly felt like a valued customer! Side note don't forget the sopapillia!!!  Thank you for being awesome!We will return!Respectfully,BryanMoore Oklahoma"}, {"review_id": "OMQUo5ySRXeG6j5RTSfRwg", "user_id": "v7qbfKtm-dF7lLJH92CCUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Miguel gave us awesome service!!!1st time here for me and I will definitely be back!!!"}, {"review_id": "AOabu6gBlRcJ05gjC1QjCQ", "user_id": "c1vOINMzNjMKYuPSpVORHg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Went to eat with friends.

The green sauce is awesome though!! It's not a green sauce like tomatillo sauce, it's a creamy avocado spicy sauce, be sure and ask for it!! My meal was good.  I ordered the shrimp with peppers and tomatoes.  I order shrimp frequently and this was good shrimp.  Although it's rare for these Tex-Mex restaurants to have a full bar, they do.  The mixed drinks are about the same - mediocre.  The service, however, was outstanding!

Those items don't come complimentary with Your to-go meal order. They charge like $2.50 per side and that isn't the market standard for Tex-mex restaurants in OKC metro. I can't think of one casual Mexican restaurant in town that has this policy. It's annoying and honestly when I get lunch to go during the week I bypass the best Mexican food because I don't like this upcharge for items that are free if you dine in. The food off the menu is consistently good and I have tried everything from ceviche, taco salad, tamales (these were cold though), to spinach and avocado tacos. The inside service is good too - always fast once you are seated usually friendly. Go early at lunch and dinner to avoid the wait."}, {"review_id": "SgdlRudHW9i7ZTKKNkC9sA", "user_id": "G8dGH2ln53sqf-qniCl-Ow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2017", "text": "Easily the best Mexican (texmex) in Norman. The food is always amazing, the margaritas are delicious, and the service is IMPECCABLE. They are SO fast, just know that your food will be on your table in lightening speed. They are a well-oiled machine, constantly bussing, cleaning, they never stop moving! There is always a long line of people during peak hours but people get in and out quickly, so just grab a margarita and sit on their cute patio while ya wait! The perfect margarita in a martini glass is GREAT and strong! I'm not a huge margarita fan but this is one of the best, anywhere. The fish tacos are my go-to, but everything I've ordered has been great! The corn instead of beans is a delicious alternative. The fajitas are very good. PRO-TIP: ask for the spicy green salsa (complimentary) and their carrot relish. The salsa is hot and YUMMY!!"}, {"review_id": "cUTBcSH5KjF_qmc0Qy4rXg", "user_id": "h-485Os1uur0k2yEf7PI-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/31/2017", "text": "My boss took me here for my official last day of work for summer break.

Best Mexican restaurant! Their queso and salsa is just the way you like it! Queso is real cheese and taste great! The salsa not too runny more chucks and homemade just like the queso.

This place was hustling and bustling but the wait time was only about 15 mins.  While we waited in anticipation we scooted up to the bar and ordered a modelo \"sloppy\" this is a MUST at any tex mex in Oklahoma.  It's fresh lime and pulp squeezed along with salt on the rim in a freezing cold goblet.  Makes for a darn tasty beer.  Also can be enjoyed with any Mexican favorite beer like Tecate. The menu has pictures that don't do these dishes justice.  Every flavor profile was spot on.  Prices are reasonable and the crowd is lively. This is a must while in town. *pro tip* you can order lunch portions at dinner time and still have plenty left over for lunch the next day!"}, {"review_id": "2VJZcCtsUkioVVc9cjqzkg", "user_id": "fYh5tWqy8bXqcmJfzbRL5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "LOVE LOVE LOVE this spot!
