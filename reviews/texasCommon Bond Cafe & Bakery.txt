I love the life-loving vibe that this establishment offers. Everything I have tried here is lovely. My favorite thing to get off of the menu is their ham and cheese sandwich, which comes on a croissant (*buttery flaky crust*). My favorite dessert to get here is their oh, so popular kouign-amann (pronounced queen uhmon). I have also tried the plain croissant, chocolate croissant, chocolate chip walnut cookie, and macarons. They are ALL wonderful, and I would definitely recommend or reorder all of them.Funny story, I bought my mom a bag of coffee beans as a part of her birthday gift and I didn't pay attention to the price the person at the register said before she swiped my card. I was a fool for that. Later when this transaction showed up on my bank statement, I freaked out because my meal was close to $200. When I called them like, \"Yooo why was my food so much?\" I discovered that their bag of coffee beans is $125!!!!!!! WOW. I wasn't even mad about it because it was of course my fault for not paying attention but mannnn, be careful that the pretty packaging doesn't distract you as you wait in line.If you come here, I'm sure you will leave satisfied!"}, {"review_id": "Esom8TTlXJzb6VhZighrxg", "user_id": "wRfG3M0BqLkT49VbTVjg7Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Visiting my dear friend in Houston, we had farewell lunch here. We all fell in love with this place. Flat bread with mushroom and cheese was amazing. Chicken torta was spicy and flavorful. French onion soup wasn't the best I've tried but surely yummy.  And of course, you have to try their pastries. I had Nutella croissant - GOOD!Lavender latte - Mmmmmm!Definitely recommend this hip spot if you are around."}, {"review_id": "zdf3o2D7rqLal9Tqag1LIA", "user_id": "J2JIo5RO8fkjWBONWWod8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "This place is bright and airy with floor to ceiling windows that that allow you to watch the world go by as you enjoy your coffee. There is outdoor and indoor seating as well as ample parking. There's a large selection of pastries, cookies, cakes and food to choose from and everything I had was excellent. From the pastries I tried:- Sticky pecan bun (can't go wrong with this)- Kouign-Amann (think croissant crossed with muffin)- Chocolate chip and walnut cookieMy favourite was the Kouign-Amann and I'm definitely going to hunt this down when I'm back in NY!Coffee was also good albeit the portions are on the smaller side."}, {"review_id": "AndN7S9Cf5guaRM7APgnJg", "user_id": "mRQpQ9xxSi7VWC2zpCvs7w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Came on a weekend afternoon and this place was packed. The parking lot is small and difficult to drive thru when guests of other tenants are also fighting for a space. It gets worse when trucks have to make a stop to deliver to these businesses too. Don't be surprised that the line is out the door and there are no tables (not even the bar seat) left, so get there early to be safe if you're meeting a friend and plan to dine in. It is really tempting to buy all the delicious looking baked goods as you make your way down the line to the register and pay. Since it is hard to find a table to stay and enjoy the goods, I took mine to go and will have to grab brunch there next time as a reattempt. The pistachio croissant was good, with a nice and flaky exterior and moist and well layered interior. The flavor was on the sweeter end and although there was probably a teaspoon full of pistachio filling inside and green colored striped outside, I thought it was quite coconutty. The kouignn amann was delicious but also sweeter...especially on the exterior. The slightly crunchy and sugary outside lead to a buttery and flaky inside. They definitely make a great kouignn amann but I prefer mine a little less sugary. I also had the boston creme pie kugelhopf, which is essentially a boston creme donut tucked inside a cake...does that make sense? It was a unique texture and if you like chocolate and vanilla pudding...this is for you.Overall a good bakery that serves some nice breakfast/lunch options despite being a little pricey. Looking to try more than just the baked goods. Everything is nicely packed in a bag for you to bring home too."}, {"review_id": "qj3ge6BWrH83pPhvY-8KHA", "user_id": "QfoIC-oZaHqjFRK9ng3Ynw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "I see why this place is so popular! It's insta-worthy and tasty.Common Bond is a bakery in Montrose that serves up pastries and basic-sounding but not basic-tasting cafe foods (salads, soups, sandwiches, etc.) The interior is light and airy with tons of space to study inside with outlets or chill on the al fresco patio with friends.You order cafeteria-style so you have to walk past ALL the freaking pastries before paying the cashier at the end. I walked inside with the intent of buying one pistachio croissant pastry but ended up also ordering a goat cheese and beet salad and an almond croissant for tomorrow morning.  No regrets, though. The pistachio croissant is the most recommended item. It has a pretty green swirl through it so it looks really good on photos. The first bite was delicious- slightly nutty and pistachio-y with a sweet kick. However, the marginal utility of each subsequent bite diminished faster than most readers' tolerance for my nerdy jokes. Moving on! By the time I got halfway through the pastry, the croissant tasted overwhelmingly sweet. So I recommend splitting one with a friend. The beet and goat cheese salad was money! I thought it was possibly the best beet and goat cheese salad of my life. They had three types of beets (red, golden and the swirly kind,) leafy sprouts, crushed pistachios, soft goat cheese, crispy croissantinis, and a sweet balsamic drizzle. To top it a off, they sprinkled a spice of some sort all over and it just MADE the dish! It tasted like five spice or cinnamon or cloves. It was sooo good.The almond croissant was also so good! Almond croissants are my go-to pastry but only if they have almond paste inside. This one has almond paste. The croissant was crispy on the outside but fluffy and soft inside. The almond paste was sweetened just enough and it wasn't cloyingly sweet like the pistachio one.I really enjoyed Common Bond and I wish they would come to Los Angeles- I know they would do very well.  If you find yourself in Houston, definitely make a stop here. I recommend getting the beet and got cheese salad and the almond croissant."}, {"review_id": "8jkq0b6KkkV9p4cT89fSCw", "user_id": "fafQY-OvIFOO0ail09Mvgg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "The pistachio croissant was screaming my name when I stumbled across this place on Yelp. Common Bond has been in my bookmarks for way too long. So of course, I was beyond excited when we just happened to be in Montrose and decided to stop by after getting coffee next door at Agora. Beware that parking is almost nonexistence. They have a small lot in the front but don't count on it. This place is always packed! Your next best bet is street parking. When we walked in, the line was almost out the door. However, it wasn't too bad and it moved quickly. They have every goodies imaginable. As you go through the line, just point out what you want from the display. They will give it to you on the spot. They have a variety of desserts. A-must is the chocolate chip cookie and the pistachio croissant. The cookies are super chunky with bits of walnuts inside. I love the pistachio fillings inside. Just the right amount of sweetness. The blueberry cheesecake is also a-must with its rich flavors. There was a few cakes on display, ready to buy. The cakes were beautifully decorated, one of them was a unicorn theme. Great choice for a birthday cake. They also serve lunch and dinner here with coffee and lattes. Water and utensils can be found by the windows. They have a good amount of tables to sit. Overall, I'm loving the baked goods and desserts here. An ideal place for breakfast or brunch."}, {"review_id": "rS6RFk3cWkhpQ65T_8Aqig", "user_id": "_XwyBtwwTDesSAUchHEjZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "There are two kinds of people in this world: those who prefer thick and chewy chocolate chip cookies, and those who like them thin and crispy.  I'm in the former school of thought and I think the latter opinion is completely wrong, but I guess it's a free country.The chocolate chip walnut cookie at Common Bond is right up my alley.  It's got a nice ratio of chunky chocolate chips to cookie dough, a chewy texture with a slight crisp on the outside, and if you ask them to heat it up in the microwave prior to serving, it becomes 5x better when you break open that cookie and are engulfed in a liquid magma flow of chocolate.Levain Bakery and Dominique Ansel in NYC are still my top two (in that order) for World's Best Chocolate Chip cookie, but Common Bond's cookie is still pretty damn good and definitely the best I've tried in Houston.  My only gripe with the cookie itself is that they could improve the ratio of chocolate to walnuts (not enough of the latter).Aside from their cookies, Common Bond also specializes in other baked goods and carbo-licious delights, such as baguettes, croissants, macarons, and they've even rolled out lunch and dinner menus as well!  I'll have to come back again and sample some more items from here... the only problem is that lines are always crazy and I absolutely hate parking in Montrose, so I don't think I'd go out of my way to come back again.OVERALL: 4/5.  If you can deal with the lines and parking situation, Common Bond is an excellent bakery with some really delicious treats and baked goods.  If you love chocolate chip cookies, theirs are definitely worth checking out as a heavyweight contender for the title of \"Houston's Best.\""}, {"review_id": "CJEktgYX0EBwb_-KkZtRug", "user_id": "dLJ2S7a0z-75In9HcrGMRA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "I liked this place.

We came on a Sunday morning and were surprised to find a spot in the very small lot next to the building but we're not surprised that the line extended beyond the inside. It did move quickly, we were able to order within about 10 minutes. We got the chocolate chip walnut cookies based on reviews. I haven't eaten mine yet but my SO reports that it's just a regular cookie. No better than just grabbing one at Whole Foods.For breakfast  I had the French toast which looked really pretty but didn't do it for me taste wise. I liked that the bread used for it was really thick, but they cooked it too long which made it difficult to eat. He had the Shrimp and Grits which he reports as just regular, nothing special. Meh.

I've never tried anything here that I didn't like. On my most recent visit, I got an almond croissant, the Herb Crusted Lamb Chops, and the Beef Bourguignon. The almond croissant was perfect! It was so flaky, crispy, and not overly sweet. There is a ton of powdered sugar on the top but you can easily tap off the excess. There's a a bit of filling inside too! The Herb Crusted Lamb Chops were divine. The potatoes and carrots are perfectly roasted and the sauce is amazing. The Beef Bourguignon has so much flavor as is surprisingly filling, but is a bit on the saltier side."}, {"review_id": "3M9DVNaQ5u_E3ldhFSFpIg", "user_id": "zxn9ZlFJKTTddjF6Du7rRA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "My favorite lunch place, such a great and varied menu, salads, sandwiches, flat bread, specials.. everything I have had has been delicious.

You stand in line to order your food before securing a table. Be prepared to wait in line for a while and on weekends it can wrap around the building.

The line is long and wait time is really bad at times.  The parking is limited to the small parking in back of the store.  And the patisseries are a bit pricey for my taste.  I ordered the plain blue berry muffins, which is just plain nothing interesting.  I compare to the muffins come out of the COSTCO box.  For the price of one I could got 12 and it taste almost the same.  I guess you paid for the location.  The ambient is really nice.  But I don't know if it is worth the price."}, {"review_id": "lertcaXPw6UlKnYvuBtJYQ", "user_id": "Zti-TPYGsNtISkAnlgWlww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "A good place for some baked goods.

When you enter the store, you'll most likely be greeted by the long line. You'll get in that line to order, pay for your food, and then go find a table. The restaurant itself is not the most chic places in houston but it'll do the trick. There are outdoor seating for those that want to bring their dogs.
