Everything is made from scratch....EVERYTHING!!! I have literally never tried anything on the menu I didn't like! Eggs Benny...good! Waffles and crepes...good! Omelets...good!

Also, that was all it was....just 2 pieces with nothing more, no sausage, no bacon, very sad and I don't like leaving a restaurant still hungry (and I don't have a huge appetite).My husband had an omelette which was okay, but he said it was just that...OK.  I will say their coffee was very good and because of that and the excellent service and staff, they get 3 stars.  After paying the $25 bill (and still being hungry), I have to say this was very disappointing."}, {"review_id": "353deqSdzo2o3G3kJE71eg", "user_id": "MbnEXuQhTDcNuRlYtxH-PQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "This is one of the best breakfast places I have ever been in. The staff were very warm and helpful. The food was excellent. I went with my daughter and my sister, who is on this special diet. The server was suggesting things to her and was in no hurry to get our order. The place was 3/4 full and they had more than enough wait staff. Very excellent breakfast.

French toasts...any kinds...never disappoints. Fresh squeezed orange juice is awesome...if you don't mind spending $3.25 for a small glass. They have the machine at the back of the restaurant. I had their coffee and this is their weakest item in the menu. It is VERY watery, and not much of a wake up coffee. Plus there is only unflavored creamer. It was so busy that I did not want to ask for flavored creamer like french vanilla, hazelnut, etc. I spent almost $40 for breakfast with my son...yes, just the 2 of us. For the amount of money we spent, we did not bring a to-go box; which I really like. I don't like the super big portion myself. However, compared to other breakfast restaurants around, this place is too expensive. I don't think I could go out every weekend with my family of 4. The wait was also too long. However, the people are nice."}, {"review_id": "TVyi72izfjmwezGuXGWfRA", "user_id": "4i0aKrvwY3qcfS9wR2zGUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "We love the griddle, it is our go to place for brunch. They have amazing crepes and omelettes. The orange juice is as fresh as you can get! Must go to place. If you go on Saturday or Sunday make sure you get there early or be willing to wait 40 minutes to an hour. I would say unless you are totally starving it is worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "duQzcUFbcWgIfl0rCLskUw", "user_id": "27ocFgaTnAMJwTgcVWkaKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2017", "text": "Love, love, love this restaurant! If you are looking for a spot to have some great morning food, look no further than The Griddle. Be warned, this place is no longer a secret in the valley which means that there will be a bit of a wait but it is so worth it. Personally, I recommend trying their Breakfast Croissant which is an egg, ham, and cheese croissant-style sandwich. This will give you enough room to try one of their dessert style breakfast which includes their Peach Crepes. Highly recommend this yummy goodness. Guaranteed great customer service, your coffee cup will not be empty longer than two minutes (it's almost like they know when you need a refill). Great place to bring friends and family from out of town to show off one of the valley's finest breakfast restaurants.

It was a soggy mess and didn't have a good flavor at all. When I pointed it out to the server she sympathized but didn't discount it or anything.My husband ordered biscuits and gravy with two eggs and hash browns and a side of ham. The biscuit was dry and flavorless and the gravy was bland. The eggs and ham were perfect. The hash browns were a little undercooked.The kids' menu left much to be desired. The \"hot cake,\" for example, is literally one hot cake with no side. Both my kids ordered two flavored hot cakes off the regular menu. I will say the hot cakes looked amazing and fluffy and wonderful. My son didn't touch his but I just don't think he was hungry. My picky daughter ate about half (so I guess the kids' order would have been fine!) but she really liked it.Improve your customer service and some of your food and maybe we'll be back. Meanwhile we'll stick with Shari's for family meals."}, {"review_id": "cOQ6YJP3IGBi-Ni2m69blA", "user_id": "QQRbp2UbfAIZqIwOgchDDg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "Average.

We were seated right away and our drink order was taken pretty quick.  I had orange juice which was freshly squeezed in the juicer across the room.  My colleague got a hot drink that came out in a huge mug.  We ordered the biscuits and gravy and the crepes.  Both our meals came with bacon.  Plates came out quick with large portions.  Food was sooooooooooo very good.  Overall, Staff is attentive to needs, very friendly, customer serivce oriented. Food is hot, fresh, made to order, and tasted delicious!Will for sure be returning with my family!!!"}, {"review_id": "kTSONnaLq3JNyPJksGepQg", "user_id": "LyjDL89AvZchPeC-VCizaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "We LOVE The Griddle!
