I was brought here by a local expert,  and my Airbnb host also recommended it.  From the outside,  it looks like a southern building from the 1960's. The parking lot is unmarked and very busy.  The line was about a 20 minute wait,  but they have delicious coffee for you to drink as you wait.  In the back,  an old man harnesses the sound of a keyboard with his jazz melodies and sweet art dances on the walls.  The artwork is all from local artists and a shop in the back with various goods. The staff were quite kind and we were seated before I knew it.I ordered the skinny chicken,  which was a combination of grilled chicken,  spinach,  and scrambled egg whites.  It was quite delicious and I didn't feel like I had to go run a marathon to make up for it.  We also ordered the \"our B.E.S.T. French toast sandwich.  Spinach,  tomato,  eggs  bacon,  in between two pieces of French toast. But what you really should have at this establishment is the comfy chicken which is supposed to be the bees knees.  People literally come here for that chicken from all over the country. Highly recommend this place.  Please check it out!!!!"}, {"review_id": "m_NWdMBY9qA97vps69BhSQ", "user_id": "px_6P9U4HTTjX5i9_qH7mw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "This is absolutely one of my favorite places in the Atlanta area. The first time I came, it was recommended by a local. I have been a few times since then and they never disappoint. If you're looking for good, down home southern cooking, this is the place! I was trying to figure out my favorite dish from their menu, but I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the selections. The breakfast tacos are awesome. French toast...YES! Those Fried Green Tomatoes remind me of the ones my grandmother made when I was a kid. I usually get breakfast when I go, so I think I will start exploring the lunch menu...The only problem with this place is that it is ALWAYS PACKED and there is barely anywhere to park. I would suggest getting there early or taking an Uber or Lyft to get there."}, {"review_id": "0HXIkerSQv9TMwNLll2EyA", "user_id": "PMMcGelLIQEF_7mILSBkJA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "Tried the comfy chicken biscuit and it did not disappoint.  The fried chicken was super crispy without being dry.  The flavor was on point as well.  I can't remember the last time I had such a fluffy and well made biscuit.The portion was just about right.  Anything larger would have induced some serious food coma and prevented any meaningful form of physical movement.Also tried the salmon patty and outside was crispy, but inside still retained that flavor and moisture.  Just the right amount of breading without making the whole thing too dense.Parking situation could get a bit tough, but there's nothing wrong with parking a bit further down the road and walking here.  Could use a longer walk after that chicken and biscuit anyway."}, {"review_id": "2glSVFljqtOAfQ6lN9gezA", "user_id": "U6PDOKsk1ZuaV3vJaY-Z8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Food was great, prices even better.

Homegrown gives me a very familiar feeling; a traditional southern diner just does that to you. The hospitality is pleasant, the service is fast, the portions are huge, and the food is affordable. Oh, I guess it should be mentioned that the food is exceptional. You southerners don't know how good you have It. You roll out of bed and you have a comfy chicken biscuit readily available. Juicy pieces of crispy chicken, sitting on an open faced buttery biscuit, all smothered in gravy.

It is located in Decatur and may seem a bit run down, but inside you'll find great food and hospitality that the South is known for.If you come here during peak hours, I would expect to wait at least 45 minutes. This place is always packed around lunch time and on weekends. I've been here around 4 times, but only eaten here twice because of hour plus waits. There are about 30ish parking spots around the restaurant and once they are filled up, you have to find street or curb parking.The inside is full of life, always hustling and bustling with waiters and hungry people ready to get their food. The walls are covered with art by local Atlanta artists, it really contributes to the homey atmosphere of the place. If you get bored waiting for your food, you can also take a look at the shop they have in the back, featuring a collection of quirky assorted items, some by local Atlanta artists!Service is always top notch, servers are very polite and welcoming and are very helpful with suggesting things from their large menu. Food and drinks come out very quickly after ordering. At Home Grown, you pay at the front register, don't get stuck at your table waiting for the server to swipe your card!Home Grown's menu is full of all the comfort food you could possibly ask for. Portions are huge and prices are very reasonable in comparison. The Grant's Stack, Comfy Chicken Biscuit, Billy Boy, Chili Cheese Home Fries, Mashed Roasted Sweet Potatoes, and Sweet Tea are the standout items from their very extensive menu. If you are feeling brave, ask your waiter about the Cage Fighter. It's a secret menu item consisting of several pancakes, fried chicken, gravy, and a couple of other things I don't remember, but it's enough food to feed a small village.If you live in or are visiting anywhere in the Southern United States, Home Grown is absolutely worth the trip to get a delicious taste of home."}, {"review_id": "wCQIYUSnPzrQU37BdA7Tsg", "user_id": "NlJXVOhbzhHIJFobjTmO9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "Amazinnnnggggg Service!!!!

When I saw there was a vegan option, I had to go! My brother and I waited for about 30 mins at 11am on a Sunday morning before we were seated. I ordered the \"Award Winning Vegan Sloppy Joe\", and waited patiently for it to arrive. There was no doubt in my mind that what was placed in front of me was a Sloppy Joe, but it did not look award winning. The plate was sad-looking and bare, leaving me to wonder if they had forgotten something. Certainly, the presentation was not award winning, but maybe the taste was. As I bit into the Sloppy Joe, I could immediately taste a tangy BBQ flavor. The texture was spot on and the portion of the Sloppy Joe was good. I wish there was more depth to the flavor though as I felt it was missing something. I also think my meal would have been improved if the plate didn't look so sad upon arrival (see pics). Overall, I think Home Grown is not a place vegans go to by themselves, but somewhere to go with a group of omnivores who don't want to go somewhere with a tofu scramble. Service was wonderful and the ambiance is relaxed. Parking can be a headache - the lot is always full and street parking can get difficult."}, {"review_id": "mAyp6bpES-VFser1xZfAFA", "user_id": "G1h1gHD9q31P4b-sIBoz6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Fresh, hip, cool, in a funky neighborhood, Home Grown even has a catchy name.

While dining here you're likely to see a surgeon, politician, rapper, hairstylist, blogger, police officer, firefighter, and the person that's planning to open the first dispensary in Atlanta. In other words it's diverse with GREAT food and service. On this particular visit I opted for one of the local favorites, the Comfy Chicken Biscuit. With that I added two cheese eggs+homes fries with onions and peppers. Food came out fresh and needless to say the portions are huge. If you're not in the mood for breakfast they have several other items on the menu that will not disappoint. Be sure to get there early because the lunch crowd is no joke.

There is a pretty small private parking lot behind the restaurant, but few perks of waking up early are no waiting line and hassle-free parking. We were seated immediately and I noticed a small thrift/gift shop hidden in the back of the restaurant. Breakfast menu is served all day long, lunch menu is served after 11 PM, and brunch menu is served on weekends.***[Lunch & Brunch Menu] Fried Green Tomatoes (with horseradish sauce - $5 tax included): Tomatoes were lightly fried with no sour tomato aftertaste. The horseradish sauce didn't taste like horseradish at all and it was more like a ranch dressing (more salty than I would like).[Breakfast Menu] Comfy Chicken Biscuit (open-faced with fried chicken covered in pork sausage gravy - $11 tax included): This dish came with lukewarm chicken and biscuits. Good gravy and tender chicken with light breading, but biscuits weren't very fluffy and tasted slightly cold (at least biscuits didn't taste bland).***A very solid breakfast place in Atlanta - their pork sausage gravy was very savory and I did not leave a single drop of gravy on my plate!"}, {"review_id": "Ma3YReOHlnQxxgk3BD6nlw", "user_id": "BOh3_pP0Di-txZomArm4yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I don't know why it has taken me so long to review this place.  This was one of the first spots that I had breakfast at when I moved back to Atlanta.  I had the comfy chicken biscuit the first time and this last visit I had the catfish.  The chicken biscuit is definitely Southern comfort food.  It's a combo of 3 great things that the south is known for (fried chicken, biscuits, and gravy) all smooshed into one.  The flavors of each individual​ item could stand on its own ​but combined they form a beautiful Trinity​.  The service is great too!
