Not really Peruvian but who cares if the food is amazing, right?!!! After living in Los Angeles for more than 10+ years and moving back to Charleston, SC a couple of years ago. I MISSED  what I call \"West Coast Tacos,\" which is basically meat, onions, cilantro and a side of lime. Pollo Loko makes the BEST tacos. Add a little Verde (Green) sauce on the the taco, it's MIND Blowing!!! WOW!! The guacamole and chips are really great too!!Happy Eating ;)"}, {"review_id": "bYMzwFCTOZn_73Mb27W7vA", "user_id": "6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I just love tacos and after seeing tacos on the menu I just had to have them.  I got the tongue, chicken, pastor and steak tacos.  They arrived a few minutes after I ordered them and they looked delicious.  My favorite was the pastor which was nicely spiced pork and so tender and tasty.  I also liked the steak and tongue also as they were both very tender and pretty tasty. The chicken was unusually tough and was my least favorite.   I added the tomatillo salsa to the tacos and it was very a tasty addition. Wish they would have put some Queso Fresco on them to add to the flavor.    My work buddy got the Loma Saltado which was very tasty.  I got to try it and the beef was very flavorful and tender.  He liked the food so much he brought his wife and a couple of friends back that evening for dinner.  The inside was nothing fancy and was simply decorated but did look very clean.  The service was very good and the server took good care of us.  The price point was on the high side but well worth the occasional treat to get the good street taco craving taken care of."}, {"review_id": "saMDk2brD-Hi-rRFh5f-2g", "user_id": "QNEz180CIo1BopB_ZqKH5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Wow what a amazing little place, friendly service and just great little taqueria.  Had 4 tacos after a long day and it really hit the spot. 2 pastor, 1 steak and 1 chicken.

They were running a limited menu because of the coming tropical storm, but the staff was friendly. The chicken we tried was excellent as was the rice, beans, and salad. We paid a little extra for tostones and were impressed with the quality of the food.We ordered a whole chicken and it was enough to feed 3 people although it normally is meant for 2. The chicken was moist on the inside and the skin was delish. The location is definitely not very inviting as was mentioned by other reviewers, but I would say Pollo Loko has that mom and pop vibe going pretty well. Overall, a solid find in North Charleston that I would recommend. Would've loved to try their Mexican food because it looks great, hopefully one day in the future."}, {"review_id": "zNTtvXmoo1QimniRVdFh2g", "user_id": "bCmlx4dPDt1HA32_uc67kQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Traditional and tasty.  Very authentic food and same with the atmosphere.  We sampled traditional dishes including, the chicken, sausage, pork and beef tongue.  The sausage was the least favorite of an otherwise delicious meal.  They were out of avocados so we missed out on their homemade guacamole.  The fresh pico de gallo was a nice substitute.  The loud rap music from the kitchen drowned out the preferred traditional music that was playing.  However, that in itself took me back to trips to central and South America."}, {"review_id": "rtep_zp66bcL6FkB6s2zpg", "user_id": "fuaMlZMm-Gwby3pYpYItbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2017", "text": "I came here solely to try the chicken. Quarter chicken was larger in portion than any other chicken specialty places. It was super juicy, tender and flavorful.

The sign is so worn down that you couldn't be sure if this is Pollo Loko or part of the restaurant located next door. The location is a bit sketchy at the night, but we were comfortable once we entered the restaurant. The fried plantains were my favorite! The yucca fries were crispy and the Lomo Saltado (mixture of beef, fries, tomatoes, onions and rice) was moist and flavorsome.

I first heard about it from a friend of mine and became more interested as I looked at the pictures on Yelp (if I don't get hungry from the pictures, I probably won't go). Man! My friend was right. It's a small dive that I pass by all the time and didn't notice until now. But they serve up some amazing Peruvian food.I stopped in for a to-go lunch and ordered the pollo tropical which had chicken, cheese, pineapple, and onion with tortillas on the side. It also came with pinto beans, yellow rice, and cabbage. I loved everything! So flavorful. Each bite danced in my mouth. That might be an exaggeration but I need you to understand just how amazing the food is.  Also, my order came out very quick! One of the ladies gave me their card and told me I can call and order ahead next time as well.There was a ton of food left on my plate after I was beyond full. They definitely give you your money's worth. I have enough for dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow! I'm definitely coming back. This may be my new go-to spot!"}, {"review_id": "HdBxwALRQWZAxC4IhmcT3g", "user_id": "3cLIri05SWjX2KpcQK6_Lg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2017", "text": "Pollo Loko was a welcome surprise. My mother had just finished up some local business, so we were looking for something local that seemed unique, and Pollo Loko fit the bill. It's a little off the beaten path and is definitely a hole in the wall (frankly, those are my favorite kind of places), but the food was satisfying and well worth the asking price.My mother had the Lomo Saltado, thin slices of steak, cooked with tomatoes, red onions, spices and served over french fries with a side of rice. The amount of food was plentiful and it tasted delicious (the steak itself tasted very similar to a similar steak preparation my Cuban grandmother used to make, minus the fries).For me, the lengua (cow tongue) taco has kind of become my baseline indicator of any restaurant that has them on the menu. The best I've had are at Real Mexico in Columbia, SC, but these may well be the best I've ever had. The only downside is that the minimum taco order is 5, which means you need a hearty appetite if you're going solo. The lengua was cooked very, very well, soft, juicy and tender, but with a bit of char to the edges of the meat. Each taco was absolutely packed with it. Served with cilantro, diced onion, lime wedges and sliced cucumber, these were the tacos I was looking for. Throw in a cerveza Victoria, and I was a happy camper. The red sauce that was served with the tacos was delicious as well...not as spicy as I was hoping, but very flavorful and a good addition to the lengua, onions and cilantro in the tacos.If you're in the Charleston area and looking for some Latin American food, this is a great place. I kind of wished I had tried their chargrilled chicken, which looks amazing, but the tacos won't disappoint. You'll need to keep your eyes peeled to see it, because it's easy to miss (I drove right by it, and I was looking for it) as it's in an older, very unassuming strip mall. It won't win many awards for the setting, but the food more than makes up for that."}, {"review_id": "B9c3-2ZPPt4hFLEfPWHB_Q", "user_id": "NF0gkH5iOt1zZjErKgv2HA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "It took us a while to find this place due to the fact they don't have a sign up???

We drove past it twice before finally spotting the old signage which blends in very well with the building itself. There are two options...you can order at the counter and wait for your to-go meals or you can seat yourself in the dining area. We opted to sit down. There was only one server for the sit down side. He was VERY nice and helpful.  He was taking care of 4-8 tables by himself, bagging up the take-out items, switching back and forth seamlessly between the Spanish/English speakers and I was impressed. We got several different dishes including a basket of fried plantains for appetizers. Everything tasted just slightly bland but with the house sauce much better. They do also have a kids menu FYI. And the price was right. It would not be fair to compare this place to a Minero or Americano...different food goals and demographics. It is more similar to Santi's just in a different part of town and less crowded.

One of my best friends recently got back from a long trip to Columbia and after hearing her stories, I was eager to check out this style of cuisine myself. I decided there is a direct correlations between the sketchiness of the exteriors and the deliciousness of the food served inside when it comes to North Charleston eateries. Don't let the worn out half-written sign on the outside fool you. Pollo Loko is real deal Columbian and authentic in the sense that the majority if not all of the clientele appear to be Spanish speaking residents of the area. Wanting to get the full experience, my friend and I decided to order the Bandeja Paisa platter, which came complete with Columbian sausage, charcoal-grilled chicken, beef, Yuka, beans, rice, avocado and sweet plantains. The platter was plenty of food for the two of us and all for only $14! While the beef was somewhat dry and tough, the chicken was juicy and charred and the sausage- spicy and flavorful. A disappointment of Pollo Loko was that the restaurant was out of many staple dishes I was hoping to try- like the arepas and the Tres Leches cake.Overall I recommend heading here if you are looking to try a new style of cuisine for an affordable cost. Get the Bandeja Paisa if you are like me and love trying a little of everything!"}, {"review_id": "D1JGSJKbO3IRoQEzM_03Xw", "user_id": "s0vpBB24NC5G40iNDus-Ew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "The location is not great....be aware.
