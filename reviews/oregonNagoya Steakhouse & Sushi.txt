You never know who you'll be sitting with or which chef you'll get. You can also tell the veterans by the applause of their tables and the flaw execution of culinary flare! I can't complain and butter makes me happy! My kids have a smile on their face and they want sushi too. Oh, don't forget the Japanese sodas with the marbles you have to push into the bottles! I want the steak and shrimp. You can get scallops and lobster. Of course they have chicken and some savory veggies! Everyone will be happy! Their clear broth soup is a signature and I am a fan of the creamy Asian dressings! By the end of the night, I tip this culinary genius as he just brought my family together enjoying a moment with stranger who are now friends after this experience! Try it once and make your decision. Great to have now in Salem."}, {"review_id": "dwWeLnvznPX0E7MMpo3I2Q", "user_id": "eTfib1CTjhnMlQVi8kMfkQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update: Nagoya has added to their awesomness by adding RAMEN to their menu.

Very poor service from our server, sushi was semi-warm and upset my stomach. Saki was the only thing we enjoyed. Bartender was very friendly, because I know he knew that our server was giving us bad service. Not to discriminate, but very young staff preparing sushi, I am sure they do not have much experience preparing good sushi. Sushi in Salem Center Mall food court is much better compared to this place."}, {"review_id": "GSqwDhuwyprTEZBUE-vRqw", "user_id": "YxXMNk9pe0PmxKoqjUK5MA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Just had Poke Salad, Sashimi appetizer and Tuna belly.  Everything was delicious and and very fresh.  Will eat here again."}, {"review_id": "whn16rMJKsI9K2NkZX2_tQ", "user_id": "pZDXUSsYqWjJq5k3_ovEjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "First time visiting this place. The sushi was good. I ordered the sexy girl, sweetheart, wasabi, and paradise roll. The sexy girl was good with strawberry. The sweetheart was one of my favorites because of the fish variety and freshness. The wasabi was not strong with wasabi so I wasn't as impressed with this one. For the name, it should be wasabi strong and it fail short. The paradise roll is fairly sweet. It's good but a bit more sweet than I fancy. The sake selection is ok, but a bit expensive. My biggest dislike is the hibachi is very burnt smelling. I'd suggest better ventilation. My clothes wreak of burnt and fried food smells. Not only did I have to smell it so strongly sitting in the sushi section, but the smell on my clothing hasn't dissipated after a few hours."}, {"review_id": "b-ZUCdoOyjNcmPQWtVQdww", "user_id": "G6nc5qIGRuSzpehjpVsQqA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The hibachi side was decent, the chef was friendly and entertaining but felt like he was just blasting through the dinner as fast as he could go even when the place was empty. The meats were a little under cooked probably because of rushing through it.Gave the sushi side a second and final chance. My God the blandest tasting sushi ever! Probably why over half the rolls are spicy but still doesn't help. Whoever thought putting sautéed mushrooms and onions on a sushi roll should be shot! Freaking disgusting!! Can't believe I was talked into trying it! Don't go here for sushi!"}, {"review_id": "9q-j2pX7ydj8qKp8WcNfig", "user_id": "j4_1iTRs5VCXtEJbuSf1EQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/20/2017", "text": "Walked in and was promptly seated. There is plenty of parking near this restaurant!I placed my order and then the wait began...I came around 1:20pm and didn't get my sashimi dish until 1:35pm then I didn't get my filet mignon dish until 1:50pm. The wait was long, but the food is pretty good!The sashimi came with 7 pieces and each was a generous portion. All the fish were fresh, tender, and melting in the mouth. The price super reasonable during lunch $12.The filet mignon was cooked to my like, just over sauced. It was a little too salty so I just wiped some sauce away.The food is definitely good, but the wait causes me to question if it's worth it.Lunch specials are very affordable!"}, {"review_id": "Ebx52s-FLKh8VurhsxTDmw", "user_id": "sx_Q-gtd5PJutOMcLFrBQQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "At times it is really busy and crowded.

I invited 15 folks to attend his birthday dinner.  Upon arrival I checked in and there was no reservation.  When they asked who I talked to, I told them it was a guy and that I called on Tuesday.  The two girls behind the desk both rolled their eyes and said 'oh, that explains it'.  they never did elaborate on what that explained.  However, they did seat us on the hibachi side, which was not ideal because the seating there meant we had to be at two hibachis...not the most beneficial for a birthday dinner.  They were also non-apologetic about losing the reservation, and my entire group had to stand in the waiting area for over 15 minutes.  Very unhappy.  Upon being seated we had to wait another 15 minutes before anyone came for drink orders and then there were all sorts of excuses as to why the drinks took so long.  After ANOTHER 15 minutes the wait staff finally took our meal orders which was finally prepared at 8:15 p.m after arriving at the restaurant at 7 p.m.   The chef's for both sides were entertaining enough, and the food was tasty, however, that did little to make up for the long wait time and losing the reservation.  The management of this establishment should have stepped up and at least offered us some compensation for their screwup and long wait time.I am not sure I would recommend this establishment for any groups larger than 2 as they don't really seem to have their act together.  It will be awhile before I return."}, {"review_id": "H8gdenEfN9jXnUtu7xuOcQ", "user_id": "lZNZNgmy8zXXuNmQrqbyUw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Dislike their customer service.

(05/20/17) They have two areas to dine in. The other is the hibachi area which was very full and smelled wonderful. We ordered three sushi rolls. Our waitress was very helpful and pointed out a few items that are on many diners \"must have\" list. We tried one which was the Salmon Lover roll which was very good. We had the Mango Tango roll and so far is my favorite!  We also ordered the Sexy Girl roll. I have to say this roll was very good also. But, I must comment on the menu. It states that the Sexy Girl roll is topped with crab meat. It is KaniKama- imitation crab meat.  I can't complain about the roll. It was still delightful. But I was expecting crab.  All sushi rolls were fresh and cold. Flavored well with the different sauces, not overwhelmed by them. Another thing I noted is that they did not use nori - seaweed to wrap the rolls. They used soybean paper. As we began eating I noticed the flavor of the seaweed wrap was missing. I looked at the menu and saw it says \"wrapped with soybean paper\". If you stay away from sushi because you don't like the flavor of seaweed then this is the place for you! If you check in on Yelp while you are there you can get a free edamame appetizer or seaweed salad. We picked the edamame, my fav.  24 hours later, I wish I was in Salem so I could go back!!!   ~Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "sqEo4g-T1F1f0S056oMVWw", "user_id": "1K2asM6YOYfGt0EhKlAi7Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Food is good sevice is soooooooooo SLOW !
