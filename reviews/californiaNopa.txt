The menu features a balance of mainstays (burger, rotisserie chicken, moroccan vegetable tagine) and new or rotating dishes. Ingredients are always fresh, and flavor combos are always 100% on-point. As a relatively recent vegetarian, the ONLY meat dish I miss in my life is the Nopa-burger. But they more than make up for it with flavorful vegetarian options!Service is always friendly, and the high ceilings mean you can have a conversation without yelling, even on the most crowded nights. Is it hard to get a table without a reservation? Yes, hi, hello, welcome to San Francisco! So, if you have a larger group or want to ensure a private table, make a reservation. If you're a party of 2 or 3, and don't mind bumping elbows with a stranger, community/bar-seating make it possible to have a delicious, high-quality meal without planning days in advance."}, {"review_id": "_MqnqdoW4bDfamWC83fHbg", "user_id": "XrzkP-EPpql8cis-GlQ57A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Hey!  I'm the 4685th person to review Nopa!What else can you possibly want to know about this restaurant?I would simply reiterate that the service here is excellent.The people here are professional, happy to be there, hard working and proud of their work.Standouts once again were the hamburger and the pork chop.The  flat bread with calamari and the bucatini with a rabbit sauce were delicious too.They have an extensive wine list, full bar and some creative beer choices as well.Nopa is an another example of when SF really shines and makes you proud to live here."}, {"review_id": "MJC-xoFASUPPbEK9N780fw", "user_id": "XmEywucVDyUP9VJ4SXGjzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Nopa has everything I want in a restaurant: positive energy, good people watching, good service, and food that can be surprisingly good.Avocado toast has been improved since I last had it here.  Now the ample portion of avocado is served over bread that has been warmed and can be cut easily.   And the shiso, tangelo, and walnuts atop the avocado made for an interesting plate of food.Roasted halibut came with mushroom panna, zucchini, and frisee.  The fish was perfectly cooked and not at all dry.  It put to shame the dried fish that I had at Frances the next evening.  Nopa is competitive with the best restaurants of the city."}, {"review_id": "ZVcFxwPxQP3QlDQ_Jk9ZPQ", "user_id": "PZOf15ZMAjmvRTRe2p7W1Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Everyone said Nopa had the best brunch in SF, so I made reservations 3 weeks in advance.

Custard French Toast - (10.5/21) Candied Cara Cara Orange and Poppy Seed ButterEveryone said this was the brunch item to get! This shouldn't be classified as a french toast in my opinion. It was super eggy and fluffy. It was good, but nothing memorable. Butter Basted Eggs - (17) Tasso Ham, Braised Greens, Butternut Squash, Danish Rye and Scallion Cream CheeseToo many flavors going on! My mouth was so confused! Also, $18 for two eggs? You're joking right? Wood Grilled Hamburger - (18.5) Pickled Onions, French Fries and Pimentón AïoliBest thing we got! The fries are the best I've ever had. Super airy and crispy. The burger was heavenly too! Super juicy and flavorful. Oh man, I would order this entree again in a heartbeat.

The burger lived up to the billing! The burger is served pretty plain, with just a perfectly medium cooked patty (or however you'd like), cheese, and a bun. Lettuce and plentiful pink pickled onions are on the side, along with ketchup, aioli, and a heaping helping of wide french fries. The aioli was amazing on top of the burger and for fry dipping. My friends warned me not to eat too many fries with my burger because I would get over-stuffed... it was hard to resist.  At $18.50, it's one of the cheapest things on the menu.Wasn't a fan of the Grilled Broccoli because of the lemony flavoring and the huge stalks, but everyone else loved the order."}, {"review_id": "_QeD6mDS7qGhd1DSJJsS9g", "user_id": "W5spiZ9GhAJDtdiYbnBN4g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Brunch - Came at 10:30am PT on a Saturday thinking I was early and there were already half a dozen people in line without reservations waiting for a table.  Thankfully, they allow you to start putting your name on the list prior to 11am.  That said, even though I was the 3rd party in line, there were no tables available.  I had the option of the communal table or the chef's counter, so of course I picked the counter!  It was a little extra special watching the chefs cook our food in front of us.  Must orders:  Soft scrambled eggs w/ pepper ham.  It also came with a biscuit, which complemented the dish quite well.

Arrived at 6:00 and the place was already packed to capacity. We got seated upstairs right above the kitchen, which gave us a glimpse of the operations below. Our appetizer orders came out really quickly and then there was at least a 25 minute gap before our entrees was delivered. Now the dishes we liked:The country pork chop was definitely a crowd favorite and justifiably so.  It was very tender and juicy.  The kiwi cilantro salsa was a great compliment. The lamb sugo with polenta was also tasty. The spaghetti with pancetta and romanesco with cooked al dante and had a good cheesy flavors similar to a carbonara; but we wished the portion had been bigger.The roasted black cod was buttery and was my daughter's favorite.The braised rabbit with mini shitake mushrooms was also pretty good.  It tasted like chicken.  :-)Now the not so good dishes in our opinion:The duck rillette didn't have much flavor and the texture was a little too smooth for my taste. I prefer a rustic dish like a rillette to be a little more chunky. The smoke brisket, while super tender, was a little salty and basically tasted like corned beef. The creme fraiche panna cotta was very soft, almost runny. Not the texture I'd expect. The sesame brioche donut had the texture more like bread, johnny bread to be more specific, instead of the lighter and more airy donut. The wife is a donut lover and was disappointed. The \"rocky road\" sunday, which was highly recommended by our server was just ok. For some reason the ice cream didn't taste very cold. One other thing that caused me to deduct from the rating was I noticed one of the chefs routinely tasted the food with a single spoon and continued to plate the food with it after he had put it in his mouth. I would expect that from a neighborhood diner; but, at a fine dining place like this I'd expect the chef to have a separate tasting spoon that never touches the food to be served. It was off-putting to watch."}, {"review_id": "xpMcPwqY61v-PTbup20auQ", "user_id": "XEu_Vvm976MTqeiIu9HfbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I thought dinner was good at NOPA, but brunch threw me for a loop because that was truly mind blowing.  Phenomenal. Worth the wait. Worth the price. Get the french toast. Ok I'll actually use full sentences now. Here's your weekend brunch strategy for NOPA---arrive around 10:20. They open doors at 10:30 and there will probably be a line when you get there but stick with it! At 10:30 they let everyone in and you can get your name on the list for the community table really easily. Then you can grab a coffee or mimosa at the bar and wait until they get you seated at 11. I don't know why they don't seat you at 10:30 but 30 minutes is hardly a wait considering some of the other SF brunch destinations. We ordered the custard french toast which was truly one of a kind. It's soft and sweet and melty and perfect and just get it. You can get one or two pieces so it's great for sharing as an \"appetizer.\" I had the baked eggs which are cooked with a chunky tomato feta sauce with pesto and israeli cous cous and crusty bread. Phenomenal, and not greasy or too filling. My friend had the basted eggs which came with amazing sauteed mushrooms and greens. Such an exceptional brunch experience, I didn't even care that I spent $52 (also got the blood orange mimosa). My only slight complaint is that they don't have gluten free bread which wasn't an issue for me, but my friend couldn't have toast with her eggs which I found surprising for a hip SF restaurant. But I love gluten and this didn't impact me at all. This brunch rocks, get there quick.

We were able to be served drinks while waiting though, which was nice!Food we ordered:1) warm goat cheese with crostini-- came with slices of apple and a cinnamon caramel-like applesauce on top of the cheese. Crostini were insanely crunchy and tasted amazing with the cheese and applesauce! 4.5/52) fries-- hot and crispy fries with 2 different sauces. 3.5/53) Pork Chop-- delicious!! Presentation was beautiful, but the dish itself tasted even better! Bf was really happy about this. 5/54) Fish Stew-- so many different kinds of fish, clams, and other yummy seafood!

But then our French Custard Toast, Black Pepper Sausage and Creme Fraiche Panna Cotta came out, and they did not impress. First off, the French Custard Toast was way too thick and soggy. I think it would've tasted A LOT better if it was cut in half and was a bit crunchier. We only ordered 1 (you have the option of ordering the full size), and good thing we did that because it was extremely filling. The Black Pepper Sausage was my least favorite. I couldn't eat more than two bites. It was very dry. Yuck. Oh and beware, the sausage is HUGE! (It didn't look too appetizing lol) Luckily, I took it to go and gave it to a homeless guy outside. For the Panna Cotta, I was extremely disappointed. I'm usually a HUGE FAN of Panna Cottas - I get them everywhere I go but i think they put too much topping on this one. It was way too sweet, you couldn't really taste anything else except the walnut brown butter crumble."}, {"review_id": "n65cQuMOSHY2AqY8Rq3J-w", "user_id": "xVtdDu-V3_roVaM6O2Iv4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "The pork chop was delicious.

This one was recommended by our waiter.  Neither of us really eat pork chop but this one will blow you away.  I've never had pork chop this tender, moist and juicy inside (way too many overcooked pork chops)- it almost reminded me of lamb texturewise.  The beans were very savory, the greens added a decent bit of bitterness, and the persimmon was a nice, light, sweet touch.  These dishes, in addition to a glass of red wine and a beer, came out to under $120, which, for the quality of food, seems reasonable to me.  Highly recommend visiting here if you want a good, Californian restaurant (seasonal, local ingredients)... and highly highly recommend THAT PORK CHOP!"}, {"review_id": "KpedHPcrYh7h6Eg0Gm-VRw", "user_id": "DWGMG-UdGyEPNokF9ATHRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Wow!

What I get is \"I would recommend going a bar and getting another drink\". Umm?I said - its ok I'll wait for a bit. I waited until 10pm. Feeling ignored while I wait in a corner. I was asked by another hostess \" can I help you\", and as I start responding saying I have been waiting since 7.30- she just left!!! At this point I decided I wanted some food and it didn't matter if it was from NOPA!
