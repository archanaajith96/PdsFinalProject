Mexican toast consisted of a griddled honey oat bread topped with sauteed banana, smoked pork loin, 2 eggs (over easy for me), cheddar and then smothered in mole sauce. Sounds crazy right? Like, crazy bananas. Well guess what? It is, BUT it totally works. Will be back again!"}, {"review_id": "61PfvrDnF79LW0hupSIGqw", "user_id": "WbgjzXvvUGcmkRDEaKPUpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/27/2017", "text": "Mmm, this was one of my favorite places on our entire trip to New England. This restaurant boasts a friendly, eccentric, sort-of western theme with so many unique and interesting menu options, it's hard to choose.I ended up getting the Haystack Hashbrown with Smoked Salmon, capers, sour cream and green onions which seems to be a pretty popular dish. It also came with a small bean salad and I got an extra fried egg with it. It was such a perfect combination of flavors - the warm hash brown with flaky, smoky salmon, cool sour cream, crunchy green onions and tart, salty capers. Top that off with a fried egg and you couldn't possibly ask for more!Service here was excellent - very friendly and very quick with everything. I wish I lived close by because I would be here every week."}, {"review_id": "Lxt8_7kPwljwb7hNKhPDkQ", "user_id": "5XpKCQyWK7hEJzEMHPrsbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "We were looking for quirky breakfast and we found it.  The waffle + gouda + prosciutto was great.  Waffle +  bri + mango + honey was top-notch.  1/2 piggy in blanket + gravy + 1 scrambled egg on side hit all the right spots.  5 Stars"}, {"review_id": "0DShKch2jrm7ib43HDQ3pQ", "user_id": "YtUPFP3tC9tCVqNcD5nQSg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "This is my absolute favorite place in Burlington. It is comfort food with a delicious twist. The cowboy coffee is seriously the BEST cup of coffee in town! This place only serves breakfast and lunch, and I have never had a bad meal with either.

After about a 20-minute wait we were seated in this adorable, quirky, will-never-forget restaurant for a very late breakfast. The menu contains a smattering of all sorts of funky items, which made it quite difficult to choose something. They have stuffed pop-overs, pigs-in-a-pancake, spaetzle, you name it! The chef's colorful history is probably what makes the fare so unique, so if you are up for something different, this is your place!I ordered the Eggs Cassidy, which is basically a ranch-style Benedict. Two sweet-ish corn cakes topped with a brisket-like chili, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. On the side was a little spinach salad with black beans. The great thing about this place is how quickly the food was served. After we ordered the food arrived in about 5 minutes. I do wish I had ordered a cowboy coffee or some milk + maple syrup (mmmm...), but we were geared up for a day of dehydrating activities already. Too bad this place isn't open on Mondays or we would be back again tomorrow!"}, {"review_id": "zf-fHW3ME990DuOZ6LAq6A", "user_id": "duMY5V6JYKedcze-Eh1yYA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "Food was good, but they serve instant coffee and it's like drinking water with some coffee beans waved over it. ‍"}, {"review_id": "i471g3Fn50xXWPEKZ1YVPA", "user_id": "6qoQcJrkG7IbZCIGxwRZ1A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "Delicious.
