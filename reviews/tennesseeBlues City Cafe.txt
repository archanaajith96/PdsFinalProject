That's becoming very common at many restaurants I've been at recently. However here it took over 15 minutes just to get some water to drink...The atmosphere is very Memphis-y! It was very unique and enjoyable. I got the chicken strips with a side piece of catfish. They are famous for their catfish and it was yummy! The chicken was good and crispy and the serving was big. My friend got a rack of ribs with green beans. I tasted the ribs and they were very good. The rub was unique along with the glaze. I liked them. He loved the green beans too! The other friend got a dozen garlic shrimp which she enjoyed! They looked delicious and came in a mini cast iron skillet.We had a great time but it took forever. I would like to go back but can definitely wait."}, {"review_id": "dOgBVv4kP334Lu87dyIE0g", "user_id": "Orq1uZjMG-6_wnzhE2JHnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Upon entering you are immediately comforted by the aroma and the setting .

From the location on Beale street you cant miss the giant lite up sign. We were escorted to a room where a Blues band was performing. Our seats were fairly close to other dinners which makes it a bit hard for servers to maneuver but you can't beat the proximity to the  band. Eating BBQ, drinking a sweet tea, and listening to a live blue's just a few feet in front of me was definitely the Memphis experience I was looking for. My husband truly enjoyed it. He tried the gumbo and said it was one of the best he had. If you want to dine here, I highly recommend taking advantage of when theres a band performing and sitting in the stage room."}, {"review_id": "CvC3CZFw4ZXQGXxSRDb9yw", "user_id": "5u8op3jpkU-EzlyzNCPtUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "On our first night in Memphis, we came here.Memphis is all about the ribs,right? Well these ribs were just okay. But the catfish?!!!! OMG!!! so fresh,so delicious. I thought about it the whole time we were in Tennessee. the coleslaw was delicious. I didn't like the beans (maybe because beans and ribs are my forte). It took awhile for us to get our food, even after reminding the waitress. It made me rather restless, to see others, who ordered the same food and came in after us getting their food first. That always makes me feel some kind of way."}, {"review_id": "8bsq9tg_ht-t9ss_p0ZsNw", "user_id": "V3MobZ-Bvg-hnp7Y-QPcOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "We were in Nashville for a week, and decided to switch it up and drive to Memphis for the day, just to switch things up. We were literally only in the city for a few hours. After starting our journey at the Civil Rights Museum, we went to Ernestine and Hazel's which was a great decision. We ended up talking to one of the regulars at the bar and I told him we were planning to head to Rendez Vous. He made a face, and then told us to go ahead there. He said it wasn't the best BBQ in town, but he likes the atmosphere. I was looking at him like u don't care about the atmosphere tonight - I'm here for ribs!!! Two of his friends walked in a little while later,  who were on some BBQ board, and continued our conversation, arguing about where the best BBQ was. As you can imagine, I'm sitting there frantically taking mental notes. The consensus was GO TO BLUES CITY CAFE.We walked there anxiously, unsure if we should blindly trust our new friends. As we approached it, we saw a diner style place with  a bouncer outside and I was like I dunno...my friend asked the doorman if we were going to be satisfied, and he very confidently said it'd be the best BBQ we've ever had. I ordered the half rack with steak fries, baked beans and coleslaw (because you know, vegetables are important). Before I even started on the ribs, I dipped into the baked beans and my eyes were already rolling to the back of my head. OMG! I don't know what it was but it tasted like there were bits of pulled pork mixed into the beans which is genius, easily the best baked beans I've ever had. And the ribs.....omg. Without a doubt, the best barbeque I've ever had in my life. It was worth the trip to Memphis just to have tasted those ribs. They were perfectly flavoured, messy/wet just the way I like them and they were cooked perfectly, just rolled right off the bone, I could actually eat them with utensils. Amazing. Honestly, worth the trip to Memphis just to have some of these ribs.I'm so thankful I walked into that bar and started a controversial discussion on ribs. One of the better decisions I've made in my life :)"}, {"review_id": "p9EcCvXAId4IWfz5gj4ETA", "user_id": "c6CklxjggRSwVkouPklXGg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Amazing ribs!

Honestly.  I wanted to like it.  But I'm not coming back.   Several years ago I was there on business and my buddy and I went for ribs.  The table next to us got hot steaming ribs and they looked delicious.  Our came out and they were lukewarm, the grease had started congealing on the bone under the meat and it had the texture of chicken.  I had to chew the rib meat like a chicken breast.  It was way over cooked or under the heat lamp too long.  We asked our server for ribs like the ones next to us and were told that they were all cooked together so it's likely be the same as we had in front of us.  I said where I come from ribs shouldn't need to be chewed like chicken breast and was told that here in Memphis that's how they do ribs.  I said that's ridiculous and we walked out.  Try two...   the server was nice and friendly but the ribs were over cooked again!   Like waaaaay over cooked.  Charged like burnt ends from brisket.   The sauce was the only thing that saved them to the point that they were edible but I needed three glasses of tea to get through the rack they were so dry.   I'll not be back.

The gumbo was delicious- spicy and flavorful and I highly recommend! It comes with a slice of bread and has plenty of rice so it's quite filling.We also ordered a rack and a half of ribs which were definitely falling off the bone. They were fatty but that's ribs for ya. My SO got the plate which had ribs and catfish and he said it was all \"good.\" Helpful, eh? I have such a good review because we came on a Friday night, we were immediately seated and the service was probably the best I've experienced. Swift and friendly! It could not have been better.

I came here once with memories of delicious Memphis ribs in mind and a flight to catch. I only had about a half hour before leaving for the airport and it was mid afternoon. The server, who was on his phone when I arrived - refused to let me sit at a booth, despite there being only a few other diners there.He just didn't want a solo diner being all comfortable in a booth. I understand if the restaurant was busy, but it wasn't at all and there were only a few people in here. That put a bad taste in my mouth. He was also on his phone and I had to flag him down to take an order since I was in a bit of a hurry.To his credit, things improved after. Ordered a full rack with half to go. Came out quickly and was tasty and delectable. Ribs were definitely fall of the bone tender, while they may be the best ribs on Beale St, you're bound to find tastier options elsewhere, but it's fine in a pinch. The sides were good and they packed my to go order well while splitting the sides which was appreciated.Food is pretty good. Ribs are good. If you're in a pinch, it'll definitely do."}, {"review_id": "0sqbq4gHVaLuCDUp6AZFRg", "user_id": "QKhR0SQW-Oc4-Rg0i6umMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "We went on a very busy night on Beale and were not disappointed.
