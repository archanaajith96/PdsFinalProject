I have eaten Watonga Cheese curds most of my life but never had the opportunity to eat them fried. This week, circumstances put me within 2.3 miles of the Mule so I told myself \"Why not?\"  The Mule is tucked away on a little quiet street with a couple of other eating places as neighbors. On the outside it has a simple design, which I am sure appeals to the younger generation.  There was some outside seating that people with dogs in tow were taking advantage of. I had parked on the North side of the building because to me that appeared to be the entrance but as I got closer I saw signs to enter on the west side.When I entered the building, the first thing that I saw was the hostess stand which had its own unique look and the somewhat open kitchen.  To the left of that was a long bar with TVs and shelves lined with alcohol. The dining area was further down left of that although wall running along the wall where I had entered had several tables with bench seat on one side and chair on the other running the length of the wall.  On that same wall were two huge menu boards, one for drinks and one for specials. It was about 4:30 in the afternoon and there were only a handful of customers.  I liked that. I also liked the cozy feeling the atmosphere gave me...not too quiet and not too loud.I was immediately greeted by the waitress who quickly seated me (I hate it that I can't remember her name).  She recommended the special and gave me a few minutes to look at the menu.  I looked at the menu and there they were, the whole reason for my being there...Fried Watonga Cheese Curds. I decided on them and a sandwich (called Sandie on the menu) named the BCLT consisting of Sourdough Bread, Pecan Smoked Bacon, Gouda, Gruyere, Lettuce, Tomato, and Mayonnaise. I added Avocado at the waitress' suggestion for a minimal extra charge. She then advised me that it came with a side so I added the SPINACH SALAD which consisted of Fresh Spinach, Red Onion, Blue Cheese Crumbles, Pear Slices, Candied Brittle Bacon, and Balsamic Vinaigrette. Since I was already being bad calories-wise, I added a Coke for good measure.The Coke and the fried Watonga Cheese curds came quickly. They were a generous heaping, helping presented on a paper lined plate, accompanied by sides of Marinara and Ranch dipping sauces.  My first bite was without any dipping sauce and as the deliciousness spread through my mouth, I knew what all the fuss was about.  I tried the Marinara sauce but it tasted like Campbell's Tomato Soup without water added so it got pushed to the side but the Ranch sauce had a good flavor and complimented the fried curds.  I had to stop half way through because I knew if I finished them, there would be no room for the other entrée items I had ordered.When the sandwich and salad arrived, the presentations was very nice.  The salad was fresh and, although a bit heavy with what seemed to be oil combined with the balsamic, still delicious. The combined ingredients provided a unique pleasing flavor.  The bread on the sandwich was thick and it had been grilled on both sides.  It had been cut in half which made it easier to handle. I was only able to eat half the salad and one half of the sandwich and as I boxed everything up, I was smiling because I knew what I was having for lunch the next day.I paid my bill which with tip included was about $22, reasonable considering I was getting two meals out of it. As I left the building, I was able to capture several photos of the entire.  All in all, I really enjoyed finally eating fried Watonga Cheese curds and my overall dining experience at The Mule.  I would highly recommend both to anyone in the Oklahoma City area."}, {"review_id": "caURmNqB4lLgvgafnTuejw", "user_id": "OmOOzGKYwPUxyG4_xMFFRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Omg this place is the coolest little millennial exposed beams, Edison bulb, fusion sandwich, crafted cocktail joint. I'm obsessed. In the start of the plaza district, it makes a very inviting stop for a Friday night, opening up the opp for many possibilities. The wait was about 25 min on a Friday night, which was worth it. We just grabbed a few drinks first. I tried the Okie mule first and immediately loved it. It's sweet and tangy with a little kick, but refreshing. I tried their mimosa and some other 'sweet' drink but they weren't really sweet-mostly just tart. I thought that stirring it would get the sweetness mixed but it didn't. So I just stuck with the okie mule.I ordered the macaroni pony-Mac and cheese and pulled pork on toast-with a side of onion rings. I usually hate onion rings but omg these were amazing. And that sandwich was heavenly! It was a little cold when we got it but idc still delicious. The service was okay. The bartenders were amazing, but our server had a bit of an attitude about me not liking the 'sweet' drinks. I made all my friends try them and they all said they were tart so I know I wasn't just being difficult. I would definitely come here again though."}, {"review_id": "XpypxHaAQJ-cLX1-z1QqPA", "user_id": "rkhwpka73uKjWYipwaxOzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "Gourmet grilled cheese?

They know what they're doing! They have a great balance of flavors on each custom creation. I split the Caprese and BCLT with a friend. Both were delightful, but the Caprese was my favorite! More than enough sandwich for one person. The seasonal side was delightful, but my friend said it could have used a lot more Brussel sprouts. The sandwiches took a little long to cook at 4 in the afternoon, but don't let that prevent you from going. The food is worth the wait! You can tell they're cooking it just right.

The second stop of my three evening tour of the Plaza District, and it may have been my favorite. The decor is a little divey without being downright shabby, striking a nice balance that makes it feel comfortable to be in. There is a nice outdoor seating area as well. First up for me was an old fashioned with Basil Hayden whiskey. It was a nice example of the classic drink, and definitely not skimpy on the booze. Next up was a plate of \"Okie poutine\", a delightful arrangement of well cooked, fresh cut fries, topped with Watonga cheese curds and white gravy. I liked the white gravy variation on the classic Canadian original, it definitely lent a Southern style to the dish, and it tasted great. For the main course, I selected \"The Cortez\", which was a fairly easy to actually hold sandwich featuring jalapeño cornbread, braised short ribs, Peperoncino cheese, grilled jalapeño, caramelized onion, and spicy aioli. The cornbread isn't really what I'd classically call \"cornbread\"; it was more of an actual bread texture with a flavor and a bit of texture of cornbread, so don't expect it to be like Grandma's. Having said that, it was quite good, and the combination of it and the other ingredients, particularly the tender short ribs, made this a very tasty sandwich. A cup of tomato soup procured for dipping wasn't as inspiring as the other dishes here, so I mostly just ate the sandwich by itself. Overall, this was a very nice meal, and I'd definitely come back to try some of the other \"sandies\" as they're called on the menu. Definitely get that Okie poutine when you go, though!"}, {"review_id": "_7qllRny6CHZ1kXcIS5EAw", "user_id": "MgTtMcZ-DpAXhyvxzWDOTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/4/2017", "text": "Can't believe I haven't reviewed The Mule yet! My husband and I usually come on a weekday evening for dinner and sit at the bar. They have a good selection of local beer, as well as several versions of the Moscow Mule cocktail (vodka, ginger beer, lime). My favorite is the Dark and Stormy (with rum instead of vodka). The ginger beer they use has such a bite, so good! If you like a sweeter drink, probably not for you. All of the \"mule\" cocktails are $7, which I think is a great price.For appetizers, we've tried the Okie Poutine, Stuffed and Baked, and the Fried Cheese Curds. The fried cheese curds are the winner by far! They remind me of chedd'r bites from Sonic (which I used to eat ALL the time back in high school), but turned up a notch! The breading is light and crispy, the cheese is melty and soft, and the marinara and ranch dipping sauces are tasty. So good. We get them every time :pI don't think you can go wrong with any of their sandwiches. They are all hot, grilled sandwiches, with bread that comes out with that perfect crispiness. My favorite is the Herbivore. This is how you make a veggie sandwich! The beets and mushrooms give it meatiness, it's flavorful and has some heat from the jalapenos. One of the side options is a \"seasonal\" side, which changes every week I believe and is usually something similar to a salad. I usually get this and have never been disappointed! Most recent I had was spinach, grilled peaches, walnuts, a bit of brown sugar, white wine vinagrette. The onion rings ($0.50 more, worth it) are also great!On our most recent visit we decided to try the one dessert the have, which is a grilled dessert sandwich (again, perfectly crispy bread) with nutella served with salted caramel ice cream. YUM. Reminded us of something we'd see on Chopped, creative and sticking with the sandwich theme!Just throwing this out there, The Mule is not necessarily a \"healthy\" sandwich place. Pretty sure that perfectly grilled crispiness The of the bread involves some butter ;) But everything is so delicious and the service is great, this is our splurge meal every once in a while!"}, {"review_id": "Y5ydyOLyfRRoOCVhwrX6Eg", "user_id": "QPlCf7ydYg3K1unR1AX4VA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "Holy yummy!

There was a twenty minute wait, which was reasonable considering how busy the surrounding Arts District (read: it's really one street) was. The first thing to know about this restaurant is that they really specialize in sandwiches--which they call sammies--and cocktails. If you're not trying to eat a sandwich, you probably don't want to come here. But they do offer a nice variety of sandwiches and drinks. I ordered the Fancy Pants, a chicken sandwich with Brie, gruyere, and a light balsamic reduction. The contents were good, although the wheat bread was a touch on the dry side for wheat bread. The burro, a tequila cocktail with ginger beer, was an ice and unusual combination. Overall, a chill vibe, friendly bartenders in a fun area."}, {"review_id": "tS8lf-LvJA7vMKFx8jCxyg", "user_id": "8VGBTuOayGboYguPOaHwhA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "Oh... that's good soup.  No seriously, the tomato soup is creamy, not too acidic and with a nice spicy kick at the end.  Like I said... oh.. that's good soup.  Was there with the family and we all had different sandwiches but only had the tomato soup at the table.  Everything was fresh, full of flavor... next level soup and sandwiches than the norm.  Parking in this area is limited considering how many shops and restaurants are on this block.  Give your self a few extra moments to find a parking spot.  Go in, eat good food, and drink a libation from a glass cowboy boot while being watched by a stogy evangelical holding a bible (it is a picture).  Décor: 4 out of 5Food:  4 out of 5Drinks:  4 out of 5Service: 5 out of 5Cleanliness:  5 out of 5"}, {"review_id": "SSQQvlXbbTdWSiud_wMA-A", "user_id": "bfF4P80GZ4vJn5ienaaw8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "If you're into melts then step right up, have I got the place for you \"The Mule\" is great for two things, melts and beer.

My boyfriend and I heard great reviews about this place and came here for brunch on Sunday morning. Our server was great at being patient with us in deciding what we wanted. They have such different options for drinks so it look a few minutes for us to decide. I ended up getting a mimosa to start, but my boyfriend got the Salty Seahorse and I ended up getting one of those as well it was so dang good!!I got the FYDH and he got The Cortez Burrito. Y'all...... I have no words. The food was impeccable, fresh, indulgent, hit the spot, and deliciously stupid. I try to eat well most days, but definitely decided to throw out my low-carb preferences and ate some of my boyfriends burrito. It was stuffed with eggs, short rib, and potatoes. It had this incredible cheese sauce on top and I wish I could have ordered a side of that just to dip things in. My FYDH was perfect. That egg, cheese, bacon, sourdough combo is what the heavens are made up of.I definitely will be back again and I might try to come out of their brunch time just to try other aspects of their menu.
