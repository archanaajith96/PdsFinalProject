Well, how to rate, depends on which to compare with. The service is quite friendly, nice interior, cozy, and free rice soup. We had steam dumping for app, which tastes okay, but obviously manufactured, Thai fried rice and yellow curry beef for entree, probably cuz we had much better Thai food, the rice doesn't really distinguish thai, no difference with any other vegies fired rice, at least should have some basil in it lol. The yellow curry sauce is great, pretty authentic but the beef is really too dry and chewier, (egg and corn starch simply do the work) and not much vegi for garnishment, need some greens, you can see in the pic.The sticky rice desert is pretty good, with fresh Mango and coconut sauce on top. Anyway still satisfied with this place,"}, {"review_id": "0f1WTSzJijgZqYpYsu2Ivg", "user_id": "Mz6W0zIhAr1qnrx4JMQScQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "Taste of food is very fresh, less oil and suitable for Asian people especially Vietnamese.

The servers were very attentive and used a team service model that actually works (it sure doesn't at Chili's). My drunken noodles Thai spicy were definitely Thai spicy. It's not a good meal if it doesn't make me break a sweat. I may have even hiccuped a bit.

More limes reduces the sugar, fish sauce adds the earthy pungent punchiness.Happy to have found this place. 4 stars for a suprising find here.

The green curry is delicious though not as potent as I would have liked. Service is generally quick and friendly and the prices are fair for the location. It's not a destination restaurant but definitely worth dining at if you're in need of more flavors than Cheyenne generally offers."}, {"review_id": "1j9irOKYGLsDQfhDvl6-aw", "user_id": "SHPlvhZ8TlYNRfvj9WrQ3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "Love all their Curry's  and their mango sticky rice.

The chicken curry soup is phenomenal. Pineapple fried rice and Yellow Curry hit a spot that will make your tummy smile. You want to know the best thing on the buffet though? The fried chicken wings. Are. You. Kidding. Me!!! I swear they are in a league of their own. You'll wonder why KFC--a place that is built around fried chicken--can't get it as good as these little drummies on a flipping buffet. Here's the real scoop though. If you're the kind of person that skips the soup on the buffet because you want to get as much shrimp crammed in your face as humanly possible... you need to rethink your strategy. It's all good here--soup, sides, shrimp, everything. And for the love of everything, don't skip the little table in the end where you can add peanut sauce, crushed peanuts, Thai chili sauce, and other goodies to your plate. Experiment and live a little."}, {"review_id": "1qr3gHZFwgJpXWpSNh8aQQ", "user_id": "9IcqCzh6RygDTxD51KIQ5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "This is the best Thai food in Cheyenne!
