We rarely eat in the north area anymore and decided to try this spot after finding it in a Google search (honestly, after finding out Doe's had closed - we were driving 526). The owner was so personable and we really enjoyed browsing the market as we waited for our lunch. We ended up leaving with two full shopping bags!The schwarma was amazing... Eating with a plastic utensil is rarely so satisfying. I could eat that plate every day! The rice was exceptional, and to say that about rice, it has to be true.I sent recommendations to my brothers, who work nearby, and they also raved about it. They also gave props to the kibbee, which we did not try on our visit.When near Tanger, EAT HERE! And don't skimp on the pistachio baklava!"}, {"review_id": "kTxB2Aw2g1rGvWiu0C-SDQ", "user_id": "utubOC6HjpgqN6Judy7wzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This small Middle Eastern store and deli is a diamond in the rough. As authentic as it gets. The owner/proprietor is humble and gracious when everyone enters his business. His market is a small-ish sampling of Middle Eastern foods and ingredients. The deli menu has the key Middle Eastern dishes one would expect. There was nothing we tried that wasn't absolutely fresh, delicious, authentic and better than any other place in the Charleston area. This place is the real deal folks. Unassuming location, hidden in the shadows of Tanger. Persevere to find this place and enjoy. Great kibby, hummus, tabbouleh, gyros, Jerusalem salad, falafel. Walk in the door and inhale the Middle Eastern spices.

IT IS BEHIND SAKE HOUSE. Anyways.I'm glad we persisted and found it. It's a hole in the wall kind of place, 1/2 grocery 1/2 restaurant. The menu is not exhaustive but I guarantee you could order anything from it and not be disappointed. I perused the shelves of the grocery while we waited for our food and had to resist loading up on spices and tahini (all great prices, definitely the place to buy spices). The korma was delectable. Hummus creamy and delicious. The rice was great, we spent half the time eating trying to identify what spices were used in the rice. Of course we had to get baklava for dessert and oh man it was so yummy.  I ordered stuffed grape leaves and he forgot to bring it to me (I didn't get charged for it) but I was fine with that since I was full after eating my meat and hummus. Definitely adding to my rotation of lunch spots :)"}, {"review_id": "wx-dJQh9iMmNK_YJAeIjqg", "user_id": "PX9bwc7WgE5Dcdjz-VQWCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "Went in and asked the cook to make me what ever he wanted.

Came here for lunch. This place is in a shopping complex across from the Tanger Outlets. A little hard to find even with GPS. Look for the Sake House, its next door. Very small, only a few tables. Very authentic middle eastern food. Order at the counter. The menu is hand written where you order. Not a large menu but nice choices. Gyro platters, falafel, sharwma, hummus, kebabs, salads, pita sandwiches. Prices are fair and portions are large. Most come with sides. I ordered the chicken platter. Delicious! Two large chicken kebabs nicely flavored served over rice. Came with a salad of cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, onion. AND the most delicious hummus I have ever had. Very light and creamy texture. Great pita bread as well. My friend had the falafel and baba ganoush which was excellent as well. Very friendly owners too. The place was busy and I can see why! The Other side of the restaurant is a Mart. There are several aisles of authentic type middle eastern spices, sauces, condiments, sweets, coffees, teas. Also a freezer/refrigerator with  prepared foods to take home. They sell hookahs and tobacco too! I will be back to try more items on the menu!"}, {"review_id": "vpXyAMOgwLYn1mzVtrcd0Q", "user_id": "pvbW8vJPyH1B3xrgh6RGOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Best falafel in town!!!

Restaurant- we got the veggie mix and falafel platters, both of which were very good. The menu described zucchini in the veggie mix and it was absent on the plate so that was a bit of a miss. The rest of the food was spot on. Grocery - great variety of interesting food stuffs, reasonable prices. They served everything on styrofoam which cost them a star...there are so many eco-friendly alternatives out there.  I was excited to see goat meat in the freezer section but it had serious freezer burn which is another reason I didn't give a 5 star. Overall- I'll definitely go back for more!"}, {"review_id": "CddXFrtSzAjXHWY7BI1Jcw", "user_id": "dDfuaCmUPkKfICgUXBSLVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "You won't find this place on GPS.

Seriously I have not had falafels this good since leaving Israel.   They were so wonderful, just the right amount of crunch on the outside and warm, seasoned fluffiness in the inside.

Everything comes straight from the middle east. The best selection you can find in Charleston.We got drinks out of the refrigerator (both middle eastern, sugary sodas) that were delicious. We then each ordered one of the special platters and both were delicious. The portion sizes are big, and the food came out quick and hot. They do serve it on a Styrofoam plate, which did not bother me at all, but do not expect a fancy set up. We finished our meal with a piece of baklava each, which we were advised was the \"best ever\". It did not disappoint. The pastry was flaky, the inside gooey and sweet, and both types (walnut and pistachio) were awesome.The only complaint is that the price turned out to be a lot more expensive than what we bargained for. For our meal, the total was $38, which seemed a bit excessive considering what kind of atmosphere there is. We looked at the bill and realized that the drinks (which do not have prices on them) were more expensive than we thought, as well as the baklava."}, {"review_id": "BpMJ_xIyTURc3bDv0d9o9g", "user_id": "oByk6ejEXR4sGSwX9IUkRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/20/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Don't be fooled by the entrance this place is a great authentic find.  Seems off putting as you walk in but the gentleman that works here /own this place is humerous and very friendly. The seating is deli style seating with a grocery aisle behind you.  We sat up front and ordered 2 falafel sandwiches with Jerusalem salads.  The salads were very tasty and well made and flavored.  I'm used to the veggies diced a little more but that's just aesthetics and had nothing to do with the taste of it.  The falafel sandwich had what seemed like the same salad I just had with taziki sauce inside a soft half of a pita bread. Can I say that every bite had a taste of warm falafel that was soft on the inside with a little crunch in the outside. We ended up getting a sampling of hummus with olive oil and baklava both a pistachio and walnut.  The hummus was to die for.  Although the pita samples he gave almost broke my jaw (considering I just had surgery yesterday) but I'm glad I had some of the pita bread from my sandwich left and used it to scoop up the hummus.  The baklava was good but it didn't seem home made to me.  The pistachio was a lot harder to eat than the walnut one.  All in all this place is worth the try.  I'm definitely coming back to try the kofta as soon as I can."}, {"review_id": "G3gFYkRG4JRGkBVmivs51g", "user_id": "ptGOjQFFBBUijBoIBpEayg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/17/2016", "text": "I've had the stuffed grape leaves and they're excellent.

That out of the way, I walked into Jerusalem Mart and Deli and was greeted SO warmly by the guy behind the counter. A smile that said, \"wow am I glad your here\". What a great feeling right. I ended up ordering the falafel sandwich to go. I was walking around the store just looking at the variety of goods, and out from behind the counter comes another pleasant face. He is equally as polite and started up a little conversation with me. $7.99 for most of the sandwiches, which is not up there, but paired with fries and a drink, its $10. Its filling and was definitely delicious, but teetering towards the $$ category. If in the area, definitely worth visiting.
