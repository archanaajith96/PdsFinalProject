I was up the night before looking for events to go to on Facebook and this spot came up for Springfield Restaurant Week. Not having eaten German food in a while and I wanting a reason to get out on CT I figured, why not? It was a great experience, my server Leah was great, and what a great restaurant with a lot of character. For my appetizer I ordered Pretzels with cheese sauce. I've had better cheese sauces but the pretzels were very good. The cod for my entree was delicious paired with the butter noodles. I squeezed a lemon on top which made the dish taste extra good. So good in fact that if I didn't add the lemon I don't know if the dish would have tasted the same. The lemon cake I had for dessert was probably one of the best lemon cakes I've ever had (no lie). I was topped with drunken blueberries & raspberries (soaked in Jim Beam) with a whipped cream frosting. The drink I ordered, The Bee Sting, was a great drink with the right amount of sweet and tart.I totally see myself visiting the place again, hopefully the next time to eat actual German food."}, {"review_id": "3eaSjWxP2_5yonIy41rVzg", "user_id": "ltKlP4ldeLiq4XnDrBKVdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Great food from appetizers to dessert, great German beer selection, great waitstaff, great atmosphere.  It is downtown, so parking can sometimes be a  little tricky, but they sometimes have valet service, so I've only ever had trouble finding a nearby spot once.I don't have any specific recommendations, because I've never ordered anything I didn't really like.  It really is all good.  Just try to get in towards the beginning of dinner service rather than the end, because they have run out of the more popular items many times I've gone there.It's a great choice for special occasions or large events if you're looking for someplace to host a larger gathering."}, {"review_id": "GQvbIUzchjrxdI0uKrAA9A", "user_id": "hBcycd0fm8c8RzLdtgEQGg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Time capsule magic. A true old school joint serving up the best pretzels freshly made with a gooey cheesy beer sauce, horseradish forward mustard served along with fried Camembert cheese and a whole array for killer options for mains. Let me also be clear that they have an awesome beer selection that's extensive and their staff are hilarious and service feels like you're eating at someones home. The mains I would gladly order again, lamb shank-just insane. Falls off the bone and was succulent and rich in flavor, sausage platter with your choice of sides along with their milanese which was perfectly crispy and didn't fall apart. Great ambiance to grab dinner with a group of friends or a family meal."}, {"review_id": "a22LLC1fVWFfWhe8Gmsegw", "user_id": "gi74jab2urkL3z2Ru5rt9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "This place is just off the charts amazing. Went here for dinner after a dance conference my daughter had at Sheraton in Springfield. In addition to the pictured item we also had the Bavarian giant pretzel and a fried cheese as and appetizer. The girls both ordered schnitzel one Jager the other Viener. We had a few desserts. Food was amazing. I would quicker go here at about 45 mile drive than the one that's less 10 minutes from my house. I hope my kid has another conference up there just as a great excuse to go back."}, {"review_id": "2kroa6ji0gfCrj-DxaqzCA", "user_id": "Zwjb6xl2zzdw1AOwfh46-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/29/2017", "text": "Was in the area as medical student rotating at Baystate. Came to Student Price at least a handful of times. They have great German food here. This is what I've tried;Schnitzel-made in house fried crispy while still incredibly tender and juicy on the inside. Absolutely fantastic.Spatzel-comes with a lot of the meals as a side. Made in house. Very tasty and goes great with all their mains.Sausages-made in house. Very big and generous portions. Tasted a little cold to me so I think it would be reasonable to ask them to pan fry (or however they prepare it) a little more.Chips-made in house. Absolutely recommend. Very good, think, and crispy. Order this and enjoy. Pork shank-as a caveat has skin on and pretty fatty. Huge portion but after the fat and bone not that much meat. I personally would not order again despite this being one of their supposedly popular specials.Chicken tenders-juicy and has some sort of special batter that made it a little different. It's a good appetizer!They also had a special fish with risotto that was super nice. I don't think it's on their menu but if it is, it's worth a try!Tatertots-very generous portion as a side. Fried crispy.Come here for great German food! Highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "8BaqJIfYjkI1nPZvwxF2bw", "user_id": "fgMm10gARSTZi9JB_UVHiA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "Planned a date day for my hubby and this was where we started. What a cute place! Lots of authentic decor, very spacious. Another perk is they validate parking at the lot on the end of the street. I got a coupon at The Big E for a giant pretzel and it did not disappoint! It really is the size of your head with a side of beer cheese and honey mustard for dipping. It was very good, but pricey at $10 (glad it was free lol). For lunch, I had the wurstplate--Bratwurst | Knackwurst |  Boar & Cranberry Sausage with a side of sauerkraut-- I don't even like sauerkraut but theirs is excellent. Matthew had wiener schnitzel, large portion, really nicely done. Service was excellent, would definitely return!"}, {"review_id": "1T-ct73_rqneT_GbbJZMNg", "user_id": "uCKxYka9s9fPynfsvN8iag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "I came here for dinner while I was spending the night for work in Springfield, and it was a great spot.

Pretty much everything on the menu is great. Last time we had jumbo shrimp cocktails, potato pancakes, brussels sprouts, and of course the fried cheese (pro tip: if it comes in a triangle or square you know its the good stuff). All of it was superb and a step above most other places downtown and in the surrounding areas.It is hard to try to capture an institution in a review, so you're better off just visiting yourself if you ever have the chance.

So we asked for the check, she was apologetic and we appreciated the sentiment. The giant pretzel is exactly that and pretty decent. the mustard wasn't half bad, the cheese sauce is a bit to rouxish and not cheesy enough for my taste. The candy apple martini I ordered wasn't exactly candy apple... couldn't put my finger on it though... wasn't terrible and quite frankly was the most appealing drink on the list. I had an incredibly hard time picking something to eat but went with the knockwurst on a bun with tots. The BEST part of my food was the bun it was toasted PERFECTLY!!! The tots were just that with a gross half sour pickle on the side. My husband ordered the Mac and cheese spatzle which was parsley heavy mixed in the spatzle, he thoroughly enjoyed it I thought it was ok. He also got the cucumber salad as a side which was incredibly sweet..... I had heard this place had gone down hill and I'm sorry I didn't heed the warning. The decor is pretty and on point, the bathroom was clean and the sink was actually pretty cool. Be warned parking is a pay lot, assuming there is an attendant you will pay even on a weekend. But if no attendant you might skate away free from charge!!! There is not at this time an automated pay station. You can also feed a meter on the street, which were uncovered when we walked in and covered when we walked out.  Knowing what I know now, this would be a spot for beer and share plates from the app list."}, {"review_id": "OAVf0f6BETQ8ty1w5tiIcQ", "user_id": "dGni31SIdODnpG2RHG8qDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Spent a few days in Springfield with my mom and began yelping places to take her out for her birthday. German food is always a great option and this place definitely should not be missed.We started with the fried Camembert cheese and a bratwurst. The cheese was not overly fried and not greasy, making a perfect starter. The bratwurst was one of the best sausages I have ever had. The meat was perfectly seasoned and juicy!Mom had the pork shank (delicious) and I had the jager schnitzel. Both were fantastic.

I don't remember what else we had but I do remember saying and thinking that maybe the people that hyped this up really knew what they were talking about. Parking sucked, it was street parking and the area it was in didn't seem that great but I have no idea because i don't know the area.
