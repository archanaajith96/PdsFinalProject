Before the dishes, we were offered biscuits, and they are actually amazingly tasty. I have to admit that I alway eat too much bread before my actual meal, especially for the ones like Skinner's loft. Highly suggest the wild mushroom pizzetta, the warm bread, cheese, and mushroom taste amazing. The crispy pork belly has great cilantro pesto sauce, but the skin of the pork belly is a little bit too hard (it is definitely crispy). I didn't like the chorizo & cheddar dish, since it is too salty and the potato crisps is a little soggy. spicy baby shrimp rigatoni is quite tasty and it is not too spicy, so don't be scared and give it a try.We didn't order any drink since it is a Tuesday night, but the menu seems has some interesting options. Moreover, this restaurant has some specials, one thing caught my eyes was the lobster ravioli, probably will give a try next time. I understand that there are many restaurants around the Newark street area, and you might pass by this one and didn't pay attention. However, it does worth a try when you want to have something different.Note, when my friend and I were there, we actually saw larger groups go upstairs. It seems they might have more space there."}, {"review_id": "fSWXsP9oUX7_yEgnxiDflg", "user_id": "ExVdMMgUKftrRZLJo2lwkA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "The space is gorgeous.

We were seated immediately upstairs during peak brunch time on a Saturday, outside seating was also available. The atmosphere of this restaurant has a ton of great character, cool decor, and I loved that each table had unique bread plate settings. We were immediately served a bucket of 6 fresh biscuits with butter and blueberry jam and they were amazing, and way better than getting a regular bread basket. I even googled the jam to order some for myself it was so good. I ordered the steak tostada and thought it was absolutely delicious and a fair price. Would love to come back to this restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "x9d8741iD9eg2SybVUalgQ", "user_id": "0OAgYgtiVWMFWOQKmmLe4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This restaurant has a great location and excellent atmosphere.

The braised pork belly and fried eggs was plain. Felt like pork belly, eggs, and the grits were cooked separately, there is no theme taste to it.

The huevos rancheros and the tostadas were the highlight of the meal. Flavor was on point the portions were good and prices on point. We also loved the small muffins that come at the beginning of the meal. They tasted freshly baked and were a perfect start to the meal.Unfortunately they lost some points when the server just dropped the check while we were still eating. We were planning on ordering more drinks and maybe food but felt rushed out so we left.

I came here for brunch and ordered the eggs florentine-- poached eggs were well done and the salmon was not fishy at all. It came with a side of home fries which was more on the crispy side (the way I like them!). I also had the chance to try the crispy braised pork belly and fried eggs and the skin on the pork was so deliciously fried! Also, the biscuit and muffins that came, in the beginning, were definitely delicious as well.Cost: For brunch (if you decide to treat yourself to some afternoon drinks ;P ) are very reasonably priced for the quality of the food. There is a range between $10-$22 per plate.Environment: The restaurant was busy (which is always a good sign) but we were lucky to snag 5 chairs at the bar! There seemed to be an upstairs as well. Service: Even though we ordered brunch through the bar, the bartenders were very nice and provided very quick service. A placemat was set right away, drink orders taken, water refilled when empty, etc. Uniqueness: Definitely a place I want to come back to for brunch because I want to try all of the dishes on the menu! If you love breakfast food then this place should be placed on your bucket list when visiting jersey city."}, {"review_id": "FpEQj8luedgsNNDiwSUT3g", "user_id": "pfjxtVrBq3TyYCABiKIp3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Skinners loft is beautiful and the food is very good. Service was fantastic throughout our dinner. We had a reservation and got seated immediately. We sat by the window and were able to carry on a conversation without distractions or chatter in the background. We loved the way they serve single glass wine in a decanter to pour at your own discretion. Very elegant and helpful for wine lovers. We shared tapas, side of brussel sprouts and Mac&cheese. We also split a vanilla gelato for dessert which was great too. The menu was on the small side, but when the food is done well, it works. Overall, a really good meal and we will visit again to try out more of their menu!!"}, {"review_id": "YZgtIRB-uAa7Qx-zB63Hhg", "user_id": "wM-bRxBCH2T5lWG8AZntCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "One of my favorite restaurants on Grove Street.

Atmosphere is enchanting and not one of those places where you have to scream across the table for your friends to hear you. The food was amazing. We ordered the turkey chili nachos, calamari, salmon over some sort of cauliflower purée (pictured), Cobb salad, vegan crab cake (pictured), fish and chips, chicken with chorizo sauce. Of course also had to get dessert, vanilla gelato (pictuand three layer chocolate cake with ganache. Highly recommend. Great date spot or a place to catch up with old friends. Bar on the first floor also perfect if you're just grabbing a drink. I can't wait to come back in the spring and experience their rooftop. UPDATE: went back for brunch. The brunch menu has something for everyone from super simple things like an omelette to a killer chicken salad club. Amazing atmosphere and service per usual. It's def a hot spot if you're going to brunch so there may be a wait but it is well worth it"}, {"review_id": "RwrGerFjwqMsagO0poADBg", "user_id": "nHcYx_TFBxjd77rpiCQ0WA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "Great little gem We had a delicious breakfast experience, I had the tostada plate and I must said it was a winner !

The restaurant was warm and cozy.  Dark stained wooden furniture and antique decor that made me feel that the restaurant has been there for over one hundred years. The restaurant was at the same time casual though. I enjoyed the eclectic mix of music they played. Food:  I chose something boring. I went for the burger with kale. The pattie was okay. I liked the cheddar cheese they put on top of the burger. It was flavorful and not salty. The fries were tasty and likewise not over salted. The kale was delicious; it tasted of olive oil and sautéed garlic. They had quite a few beers on tap. I went with the wheat beer. I regret not going for the filet mignon! Next time!  All in all, I enjoyed my meal.

For the roof, I suggest reserving and specifying that beforehand. Excellent service on a Thursday evening.I like my drinks spicy and they totally delivered with their Spicy Margarita- spicy indeed, but not so much to kick my ass. From their Small Plates menu, their Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls with a carrot/celery filling and a blue cheese/ranch sauce and their savory Short Rib & Rye Toasts were so tasty! Then from their Sharing Plates menu, their perfectly Fried Calamari came with so many tentacles- my fave part! I was in hentai heaven! From the same menu, their Short Rib & Lentil Chili Nachos were good but the bite-ability of the pomegranates kinda threw me.Though I got a little sweaty sitting outside in 95-degree weather, with food, drinks, and company this good, I didn't mind one bit.**Restroom is on the second floor."}, {"review_id": "cA6dT5N3dC5sGNPjvqc-cA", "user_id": "Jp2MX9axcgAV2eeE-Qx08w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Been around JC for about 4 years now, and Skinner's is still one of the favorite places to go.

Online it says that you have to reserve a table through Open Table, but I found it funny that there weren't any tables for the time that I wanted (I don't trust Open Table), so I called. They took my reservation over the phone, so FYI if you call they'll mark you down.My reservation was at 5:00 pm for 5 people, but we were in the area around 4:00 pm, so I just thought to ask them if they minded if we came to eat a little early. I always ask if they are ok with it because I know the restaurants don't like it when you show up early, but it was 4:00 pm on a Saturday. The manager (?) said yes very happily, but when we were seated they weren't ready for us (completely understandable), but what he didn't have to do was tell us \"Sorry for the delay, but you guys came early so we're completely thrown off.\" First of all, I asked if it was ok and he said yes, but then he complains to us that we're early, so I thought that was very rude. Also, they should have been ready for a party of 5 to come in whether it was my family or not because there is a table in the dining room that seats 5 people.Our waitress was also not the best. She was just going through the motions and you can tell that she did not want to be there. Whatever she did it took her twice as long as a normal waitress to do, meanwhile the place was not busy at all, after all it is 4:00 pm. Besides the staff, the food and drinks were very good. My dad got the muscles and beet carpaccio salad and said they were excellent. My grandma and sister got the shrimp and pancetta sandwich, which was good but they said that you couldn't taste the pancetta. My boyfriend got a burger and it looked good with crispy fries. I got two small plates. One was the short rib and rye toasts which I liked and the buffalo chicken spring rolls. The rolls were crispy, not oily and just amount of heat. Overall, the food is good, the staff is not that great and if you make a spontaneous decision to go there earlier than you requested DON'T, just don't."}, {"review_id": "CJUcIwV0I0pxBQnD1k0GHg", "user_id": "1ZFOZV7zA-6yZFZWoZSwxA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/31/2017", "text": "We came here on a Saturday night around 8pm. The rooftop was filled, so we were seated in the outdoor area. The interior looked nice, wooden stairs and brick walls. Now the food: - lobster gnocchi: it looked great. It had bright red color from the lobster and sauce, plus the yellow from the corn. Taste-wise, the first bite was not bad. The gnocchi had the right texture and the sauce had a hint of lobster. The issue with this dish was the lobster. It had only one claw and it's the tiniest claw a lobster can have. Plus it wasn't even chewable and it tasted bland. The rest of the dish also had bits of lobster that tasted like overcooked crawfish. It's overpriced for a dish that costs $24. - filet mignon sliders: solid dish. The filet tasted good, but could use a bit more seasoning. The mushroom tasted great with the garlic. The shoestring fries were awesome."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/skinners-loft-jersey-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
