We got the pad thai, kee mao, street noodle #1, and the pulled pork belly steamed buns.Pad Thai was super delicious. Street noodle #1 was also very good, chicken was fried perfectly. The pulled pork belly steamed buns were good but for $7 you only get two, so I thought that was a little pricey. Cash only!!They give you large portions for the noodles. I don't think most of their prices are too bad considering how much food you get. Plus it's super delicious in my opinion."}, {"review_id": "s48_WzpKAdyi4NxshNrzWA", "user_id": "LX18SF9iQC06DBpS_TQFVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Craving Thai in downtown Pittsburgh? Noodlehead is here for you! :DNever would have thought that I'd be able to get legit delicious Asian baos (bread buns) or noodles at a cafe called Noodlehead, but whaddya know.Being a hipster spot, the wait here to sit can take some time. Once you're seated, service is pretty fast. Pulled pork steam buns || $7Tender pulled pork & crisp cucumber slices wrapped in two steamed buns. Rather pricey since each little bun turns out to be $3.50. But if you have the cash, these are definitely tasty snacks you'll savor. Pad Thai with Shrimp || $9.50Nice portion of noodles, bean sprouts, and shrimp. The noodles are cooked perfectly al dente with a nice chew. Loved the sauce and dish overall. Would definitely recommend ordering this as an entree."}, {"review_id": "NTcH716mzwaj40xsoMkaow", "user_id": "0l3oz_xOFR4Itpc4ahMFWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Delicious food and the soups are very well priced! $6.50 for a large bowl of delicious noodle soup? Can't really beat that. However, they only have 2 soup options. We got the love boat and although it says it's in a spicy broth, not the spicy lime broth, it seemed to have a lime flavor as well. For this, we only got the 2 spice level and it was pretty mild. Good flavor and overall a great dish.We also ordered the $9.50 street noodle #1 with the thai fried chicken. It's a rice noodle dish with a light sauce on it so it doesn't sit heavy or make you feel groggy. It's refreshing and the crunch of the bean sprouts and chicken adds some texture. Again, got the level 2 spice and it was again, pretty mild. Lastly, we ordered the $9.50 chiang mai curry. This dish is honestly more like a soup with the amount of curry they give. The curry wasn't super thick but definitely not the same as a clear broth soup. The coconut flavor isn't overpowering like it is at most other places, but it's still there. It comes served with like a crispy, dry noodle on the top. It adds a crunch but is a bit hard to eat since they don't break apart that easy, but there are also the soft egg noodles in the curry itself. It comes with plenty of chicken and it's a very filling dish. I ordered it with a level 4 spice and the heat builds but it's a great kind of heat and flavor that you often find in thai dishes.Overall, the food was amazing, but their menu isn't that large. The dishes have the traditional thai flavors and it stays true to that and that's probably what causes the menu to be a bit smaller. The seating isn't great. They only have a couple floor-level tables and they seem to be for larger parties, the rest are high-top tables with tall stools. Also, keep in mind that they are CASH ONLY, so make sure you have cash on you, although they say they have an ATM on site for those who need it."}, {"review_id": "mKCloSlPRhsCsDBq_gGF_Q", "user_id": "KcjLcdus-XWt6E9uJeHONA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Cash only!

I came here because my friend who is familiar with Pittsburgh and it was an amazing choice.My friend and I arrived about 5 minutes before they opened and there were already a few full tables so I recommend getting there early because it was packed by the time we left.The food was incredible, I got the Love Boat and easily substituted tofu for the meat it came with. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The spice levels on our two dishes were mixed up by accident and the waitress quickly brought us new dishes without any issues which we really appreciated.

First word that comes to mind when I think of Noodlehead. Fantastic food, awesome atmosphere and superb service. I couldn't have asked for a better experience my second time coming. Oddly enough, we sat in the same exact hi-top as the first time we visited. The results were the same if not better. The pork dumplings were served what seemed like seconds after we ordered and were hot and steamy. Order one of the noodles (Pad Thai is everyone's favorite but I suggest See Yew). The spicy meter is spot on (1-5, 5 being the spiciest).

First off, it's CASH ONLY but they have an ATM in the restaurant. They are also BYOB. I came here with my friends and we all had a fabulous time. They do not take reservations and will only seat you when the entire party is present. We came here on a Thursday night and it was very busy, but we had a group of 8 and were seated at the back of the restaurant within 5 minutes because the large table was available for larger parties. My friends have all been here and some of them get Noodlehead once a week! I decided to finally try it and the food was delicious! I eat a lot, but the portion size was large and more than fair for the price. Because I knew the portion size was large, I had Pad See Yew with tofu and I split it with my friend. We ordered a spice level of 4 out of 5, but I actually had to add more sriracha (I love very spicy food)... I recommend that if you are sensitive to spice, you order less of a spice level because you can always add spice but not take it away. My friends and I also ordered the Cold Lemongrass Honey Iced Tea, which is only $2.50 and came with free refills. I highly recommend you get the tea... it was one of the best teas I have ever drank (not too sweet but flavorful and delicious). The service was a bit slow and the waiter was not the most attentive, but the restaurant was busy and the food made up for it. If you don't have time to wait, I suggest ordering takeout!"}, {"review_id": "Leeuioxpbv6uAPnlKFvoWQ", "user_id": "DosPs0fkIbXOFWBkrB9oaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "We got there 15 min after it opened and there was already a wait.

If you're not familiar with the area, you may be circling the area for parking on a week day, but it's worth it. This place is CASH ONLY, so don't forget to grab a few bills before coming in. Not sure why I would label this trendy, but it does embody that kind of place once you step inside.Since I came on my own, seating was a breeze. I sat at the window at the tall seats on a shared thin table. Kind of funny to be chowing down while people walk staring at you. Pay them no mind as you stuff your face since the food is wonderfully flavored.I got the street noodles #2 and steamed pork buns. There's 2 buns per order and they go pretty quick as an appetizer. Nice way to start the meal. Then you're greeted with a steaming hot bowl of fresh noodles topped with fresh tempura shrimp and bok choy. The noodles are plentiful and it seemed never ending after awhile. I vaguely remember getting a little bit of spice in my noodles and my nose started running by the middle of the meal (a good sign). Just be sure to keep getting your water refilled, but the spice level is on point here.If I lived in town, this would be one of my go-to comfort foods.

Noodle head serves Thai noodles all for $9.50 each as well as two options for $6.50. I always get the street noodle #1 when I come here with the Thai fried chicken and leave so satisfied. The crunch on that fried chicken is what really sets it apart from fried chicken that I've had before. I've also tried the green Thai curry linguine which I probably wouldn't order again to be honest as well as the beef noodle which I loved!! My friends have gotten the Kee Mao (similar to Drunken noodles) which is also very good. I love the rustic low lit ambiance and the servers have always been so kind every time I've come. Sitting is limited and there's almost always a wait on the weekends during lunch or dinner time but I've never had a problem with waiting. Millie's is right next door and the perfect place to stop by afterwards to cleanse your palate which is what I usually do every time I come here. Perfect place to bring a friend who is visiting Pittsburgh for the first time!
