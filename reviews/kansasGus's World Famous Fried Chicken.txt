A quick Google search and 15 minute drive later I found this gem opposite to the neighborhood Walmart. Suffice to say this is the best fried chicken i ever had ! Ever ! Never have I scraped the bone of a chicken wing so hard. Completely non greasy, perfectly fried. spiced and juicy chicken. Cannot say more. Go give it a try if you haven't been there. The place also has an awesome outdoor seating best enjoyed on a summer evening. Plate meals gets you two standard sides (baked beans and slaw) and the meat served on a slice of bread. I replaced baked beans with server recommended mac and cheese. Both the sides were fantastic. I wish I didn't order the pecan pie which was cold and can be avoided. Go for the chicken and you will be amazed."}, {"review_id": "2_asd21-yzipG1psFqtUyg", "user_id": "_V4zN6qhA5_d3saHh4Zpuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "To be honest, I never knew about this place until I recently went here for the first time. It's a nice location in Westwood Kansas City, Kansas. Their sign is very noticeable and lots of spaces and parking. When there's a good crowd, you know it is a good place to eat. I tried their drumsticks, wings, fried pickles, fried zucchini, and their mac and cheese. They have a good menu for their drinks as well.Everything was delicious. The chicken is perfectly breaded in a slightly spicy batter what has just the right amount of kick and the meat is still tender and juicy inside as well. If you love fried chicken, this place is definitely worth a try."}, {"review_id": "ZX4TEpAL5DaMmpbPu3B_1A", "user_id": "a3WA6HXw61qNN0_MgbaAWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had! Everything my dad and I tried was amazing! This was my first experience having Memphis spicy chicken and it packed the perfect amount of heat! I opted for the chicken tenders, at the recommendation of our waitress with mac and cheese and fried okra as my sides. The fried okra was amazing - perfectly crispy and well flavored! My dad had the wing special (5 wings) with collared greens and baked beans. I was able to taste the greens and they were so good - so much flavor from the bacon they were cooked with! My dad said the wings were some of the best he's ever had! We were almost too full for dessert, but made room to try the coconut pie and man was it good! Definitely not what I expected, it was toasted coconut and perfectly crispy!The space was great - I'd love to go back on a warm day and enjoy the patio! The staff was all incredibly friendly and helpful. They provided some excellent recommendations, and we plan on going back to try more of the pie, the catfish, and fried pickles!"}, {"review_id": "3D1Zv6z1DxdnU536JuppGw", "user_id": "AlSBCu8h2m_8hbk_XZ6EUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I'm hooked! The chicken IS excellent! The sides are also delicious, but the PIES are a must!!! They even make their own vanilla bean ice cream!!! Whattt!!! Whatever is in that seasoning must include crack, because it's addicting! Even if they put it on their ice cream and pies, I'd prolly still order that too!

I've had Gus's In Memphis and it's always been a go-to when I am there. I was thrilled to learn KC has one as I travel there more than Memphis. The staff was great and super friendly. I started with fried green tomatoes which had just the right amount of coating. I had a chicken breast and collard greens. The chicken was super moist and had just enough kick of spice to burn on your lips. It was also hot! Steamy hot when you pulled the meat apart. My side was collard greens. Is that real bacon pieces I spy mixed in? Why yes it is. They were really good...and I'm not a collard green super fan. I finished off with some chocolate chess pie-a southern delicacy. Mmmhmmm.  Can't wait to go back. Super casual place."}, {"review_id": "ZwbGuyvIxqoHRufrU5J7dQ", "user_id": "PJcABPX0DpCKvOL1S4X9lA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Came thru on a hunp day and was eager to try out the World famous bird....There's indoor and outdoor seating.The interior is well kept and clean.

The fried chicken is southern so it has a spicy kick to it. The same is true for their chicken fingers. I recommend getting their beer specials-- I got a 32 oz Stella Artois with a glass to keep for $5.

I'm not sure what kind of breading if any they use on their chicken but it was so tasty, super spicy but tasty. I would have preferred my wings cooked a little longer but I still tore them up. I ordered greens and Mac and cheese and both were equally amazing. Neither from frozen or boxed. I think they should do a cornbread or biscuit instead of a piece of bread, but whatever. The breading on the fried green tomatoes was a little to thick for my liking but it was still really good. It's hard to find a place that serves them, so I'm happy to have them when I can. The ice tea was perfectly sweetened and they have the BEST crushed ice. They give you a souvenir cup to take with you as well. Service was awesome, I didn't catch the servers name but he was very attentive and personable. He made jokes with us, suggestions and kept us laughing.

If you don't enjoy eating jalapeño slices from a jar of lit gasoline, then you'll hate yourself for trying to get past the skin, and into that juicy chicken meat. It's really hot. Oddly, the chicken fingers aforementioned do not share in the same sadistic, temperature-centric exercise in tastebud recklessness. Get those; they have spice, but on a scale of 1 to God Damn, they're about a four, and the bone-in chicken is squarely on the Good God Damn side of things."}, {"review_id": "whUHyDv_8VaDORdEOpL0MA", "user_id": "p17OzLJ8tEDWvCI7gQqQgA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I can't say that this is a true review, since I got mine to go and it was cold by the time I got home, which is about 20 mins away.

I love the kick you get from the spice and each bite is so jam packed with flavor. The perfect amount of crispiness and juiciness. What more can I say?I got the two piece dark meat and a side of baked beans and potato salad. It was under $8 so that's not too bad at all. The sides were OK though. Nothing special.

There's not much more that I can ask for, and at Gus's, I don't have to. The menu at Gus's is simple: decide which parts of the chicken you want fried in their thin, crispy and slightly spicy batter and the sides you want with it.  They have some good ideas for combinations for you, but they make it so easy to get just what you want. The chicken is delicious. It's not a heavy batter like some other \"K\" brands. It's a thin batter that is barely there, but holds in all the flavor punch that the chicken and spice combination has. While it has some light spice, it's more flavor than heat.The sides are down home delicious as well. Mac 'n' cheese and fried okra are my go-to sides. Always hot and fresh, the fried okra is perfection while the mac 'n' cheese is creamy and tender. Your food is served by some very attentive and friendly staff on paper plates, plastic cutlery and styrofoam bowls. It's not fancy, but it's not trying to be fancy. It's just trying to be good.At a lot of places, the chicken tenders are the best thing on the menu. For my $2, I'm picking a leg from Gus's. Tender and juicy dark meat with a bit of crispy spice in each bite.Get your grandparents and bring them to Gus's. That way they'll know you love them."}, {"review_id": "X6YHoYf3gOX-jowujDqdEQ", "user_id": "iIybo3ySC_I_JkWvvIMsIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Who loves a good comfort meal? Well if you do, like me, then this is your place! The chicken is absolutely delicious and served with a variety of sides to pick from... I recommend the fried pickles (you will not regret it). I was really impressed going in with the service there as well. We went on a Sunday afternoon and got seated and waited on but our waitress kept coming in to check in on us and make sure we had everything we needed. I also love when they give their suggestions as well on what to get, it worked out for me. I started out with a Root Beer Float -- HIGHLY recommend because why not enjoy an all out comfort food meal? Then got the fried pickles and the white chicken meal with a side of mac and cheese and coleslaw. I really enjoyed it and the meat was super juicy which is ideal. I thought the coleslaw was super yummy but didn't absolutely love the mac and cheese but maybe because I like mine super cheesy! I did also taste the potato salad and I could easily eat a whole bowl of that too myself! I will definitely be back for some more soon!"}, {"review_id": "JfSFCXbiyoFT76_RrqfUuA", "user_id": "Rb8MjLq3qUG5SP99FNTVVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "it's hard to argue Gus isnt some of the best chicken in the area! everything is made to order.. crispy with the right amount of spice! this is one of the few places in town you can actually have fries okra and green tomatoes!!they had a special today, buy a Stella, get the glass free! and the beer was $4!!!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/guss-world-famous-fried-chicken-kansas-city-5?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
