No matter that we ordered at the counter, took a number and patiently waited. This place was amazing. So very good. Totally over and above what we were expecting. My partner ordered the fried chicken burger and regular fries. Holy shizballs. I snuck many fries and I'm not a fry girl. These were freshly cut and crispy. Yum. I ordered the Cobb salad with steak... also friggin amazing. Whoa. We both looked at each other and stole that \"Holy sh*t... is yours as good as mine?\" And that said, we should've known. The Yelp reviews are off the chain - and they speak truth! The place was packed as well, with inside and outside seating. We will be back. We will happily drive..... and wait, if needed. Dang Gina, this was good!"}, {"review_id": "lx-_8yHzb82qzxCM_5fOxw", "user_id": "zQSiunA7C4i4oiNmekiy4g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "For the price , it's not a bad deal. We ordered the bistro fillet and the onion bliss soup and the short rib.Kinda weird tho, as soon as I order my fillet as medium rare my hostess says that \"it will look well done but it will actually be medium rare\". In my head I'm thinking \"How is that even possible?!\" Well our food came out pretty fast, really fast. So I'm thinking maybe the food is cooked in advance already. When my bistro fillet came out the hostess was correct though. It did look well done but it was tender. My boyfriends short rib was to his satisfaction. It was on a massssivve bed of mashed potatoes. Like a ridiculous amount of mash. The onion bliss soup was decent. But the layer of cheese hardened and wasn't gooey or stringy as I'd expect it to be.Well the food was good and okay. I'm glad it came out fast but suspicious on the quality as it probably isn't."}, {"review_id": "JzoOKXmcv4ca1e-gAd1ZIA", "user_id": "lt7bNHl-TXziny4FETu8nA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "My kind of fast casual! Lots of healthy and not-so-healthy options for all your food moods. They've also got boozy things, including frozen margs which I was pleasantly surprised about. I was here for lunch on a snowy day and didn't partake, but it's definitely good to know where all of the frozen tequila is within a square mile of my house. Chop Shop is a fairly large restaurant and gets even bigger in the warmer months with the addition of their pretty patio. While I was just here with one other person, I could see this being a good spot for groups because of both the size and diverse menu options. They've got lots of comfort food like meatloaf, burgers, and french dips as well as things on the lighter side, like soups and salads. They even have a pretty extensive kid's menu! I went with the Super Chop salad with short rib--super yummy and filling. Prices are a little high for Denver ($17 or so for a salad with protein) but seem pretty fair based on the quality of the food. Parking is not the easiest--I'd look for a spot off of Colfax if you can find it. It looks like Chop Shop both caters and delivers which is pretty convenient. I'll be back for a frozen drink soon!"}, {"review_id": "YrV5wzj_Jj-AqsZz-Elh3g", "user_id": "_bfAc3JR6d03oVLqiYKtQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "I don't know if maybe we were extremely hungry or what, but everything was gone from our plates within minutes -- perhaps the food really was that good! The short rib was delicious, and fried chicken was wonderful as well. The fried rice was on point.

Veggie burger with a side salad. So bomb!! Also ordered the Brussels sprouts which weren't my favorite but the burger was absolutely delicious!!  My mom got a side of their onion rings and the Asian salad which she really enjoyed the salad dressing and said the onion rings were pretty good. She also got a frozen mint guava margarita which I tried and thought was delicious!!  I would go again for the burger and margarita"}, {"review_id": "D21B0oAxNwyU-LQ6c9Ex2w", "user_id": "nuYC-Xr2VYuD-ZR_Kk6y6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Flew into Denver late at night and needed to make my way to boulder. I was hungry so I fired up yelp and found this gem. Parking can be a little tricky as there's no parking lot, so you need to head into the neighborhood. Which didn't seem to be too big of a deal, but I could imagine that this could be an issue during busy times. The whole menu sounded delicious, but the bacon wrapped meatloaf caught my eye. The main draw for their food is that everything is cooked sous vide style. The meatloaf was perfect and the bacon was a perfect textured touch. The the mashed potatoes and the onion rings were a nice side and everything had lots of complementing flavors. I thoroughly enjoyed every single bite of his meal. This place is a must visit if you're ever in the area, or even if you're not! The staff was very friendly and helped explain the menu. I'll definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "aGgAbHc1TL5TLveVOB9COg", "user_id": "rpstwmxYejbW_ig-ZZuXog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I loved this place! It looks like it would be a fast-food restaurant but it is definitely NOT! If you're in for some great gourmet like eats where you don't have to dress up all fancy and pay an arm and leg for, this is the spot for you! The ambiance is laid back where you can order at the front and they bring the food to you. There is outdoor and indoor seating and no pets allowed in the outside seating. We started off with the French onion soup that was excellent with a touch of their homemade croutons. Then I had their 48hr slow cooked short ribs with mashed potatoes and carrots and it was amazing as the meat fell off the bones! The portions was big and they did a split plate for our entree with no extra charge and we were definitely stuffed! For dessert, we had their delicious banana cream creme brûlée and I wanted to order another one. That's how good it was! I couldn't remember what cocktail we had but I just remembered that it was refreshing and yummy. I attached a photo. I cannot wait to be in Denver again because I will have to try other dishes on the menu! It was our last meal before we headed home to Texas and it definitely did not disappoint! =)"}, {"review_id": "la_UWFpUf1cZtOZqciZJEA", "user_id": "i1MbMKdN_UkZPusB5i63QA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I'm trying really really hard to eat healthy and 100% not a salad person. To the point that Mad Greens is the only place I consider a go to salad place because of the options available to me. So the other day I was in search of a great salad and I kept hearing about this place, a friend of a friend worked here...also they sous vide which I'm obsessed with, who doesn't love meat perfectly even and tender? I got a southwest chicken salad and subbed the white balsamic dressing. Part of the reason I dislike salads is the dressing normally isn't my thing.... the white balsamic I had here has me on the hunt for one I can use at home. so good! I ordered a small salad that was delicious and filling, although next time I'm finding a way to get an order of fries! They looked so good! I'll be back, who knows I may go back this weekend."}, {"review_id": "03eTddRoX1p9yGgbghwnmQ", "user_id": "wAdJGoQxCj76U3n1eBTQ2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "Fun, fast & friendly. For an order at the counter & take a seat joint, the staff was very attentive and checked in with us frequently. Hubby and I chose this for our pre-valentine dinner.  We both had the marinated filet which came with toasted potato wedges and peas & carrots. Put the traditional American tastes out of your mind..this is mostly with an Asian flare. It was very good, and we could have shared one filet, the portion is generous (dinner tomorrow).  We started with their roasted Brussels sprouts in a Lompoc sauce... delicious and filling.

All I can say is AMAZING !  I wanted a good filet and it was wonderful. We went after the lunch rush and there was no line. The food was cooked to order.  My fiancé had the Fried Chicken. It was crispy, sweet and delicious. It came with Swiss chard w/ bacon and cheesy polenta. It was out of this world! (I am getting this dish next time) My filet was a little over cooked- I asked for medium, I specifically asked for pink in the middle and there was very little - (I wanted pink) it still had good flavor but maybe she or I need to understand a little more how they cook their meat.  It is starved with roasted potatoes, again were a little dry and carrots and peas with an onions sauce. If I would have just had the chicken dish I would give them 5 stars. I will give them another chance to make thing right. Plus there is so many good looking things on the menu"}, {"review_id": "zFLYRu6maN077V4IpxRlVw", "user_id": "q7Es2ojyDdEj541y0TSXXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Great quick food joint! I came here on my last day in Colorado before flying back home. You order up front at the counter, get a number and they deliver the food to your table shortly after. I ordered the grilled bistro filet and the crispy brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts was DELICIOUS! The sauce on it was amaaaaziiiiing. If you are a fan of brussel sprouts, GET IT! I loved the char-crispiness of it. The grilled filet was also delicious as well. Very tender and flavorful. The chimichurri sauce was perfect on the steak.

Let me just say the food is really good (especially for the price you pay). But! I wasn't blown away. We got the steak or something or other plate, and although the steak was very flavorful, my boyfriend and I both ordered medium rare and got medium well. We're very passive aggressive though, didn't complain and just kept eating. Like I said, flavor was there, just over cooked. Potatoes weren't anything special that's why the 4 stars. They were a little soggy and not very well seasoned, I kept using the \"chimichurri sauce\" but even that was scarce. We also had the mango calamansi margarita. BOMB! You have to try this. Very different, fresh and tasty!I'm a hard critic to please, and not everything on my plate was to die for.

We ordered the 48hr smoked short ribs and the Southwestern salad. Absolutely amazing, both of them. Very fast and super tasty food with a great presentation. The only thing I disagree on is that the restaurant is leaning more towards the $$$ category here on yelp, not the $$ like it is currently listed, based on price. Small ribs, large ribs, a large salad and 2 sodas was $55. It might not be fancy inside like other $$$ restaurants but the food definitely has the gourmet presentation and the unfortunately the price too  Still, highly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "dT1CO9QGCaGwln_RbF3Z1g", "user_id": "PV3e1QsflcUeHWrZSb7dXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "This place is never a disappointment.
