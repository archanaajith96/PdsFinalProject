I'm all about love for our Very Stable Genius....I had the Arctic Char, and it was perfectly executed. It's difficult to find this on too many menus so I was pleased when I spotted it on the menu. The chef cooked it as well as it could have been. Tender, perfectly seasoned, crispy skin. And fresh. Stocked fish pond in the back lot? Maybe.The staff was all superb. From the hostess to the wait staff, all were friendly and prompt, but not too prompt. They went above and beyond. I was running really late to get to a concert (Lewis Black....give me a Hell Yeah!) and they managed to send me out the door In style...I would say more but don't want to get anyone in trouble.There was lots of Mayo Clinic money here, on this Friday evening. I suspect this is a restaurant rich donors are brought to when Mayo Execs want to wine and dine them to extract a check written for a million or so. I'm not sure why they let me in the doors, wearing my Ray Troll \"Fish Worship, is it wrong\" T-shirt, But they did. God bless them and their crazy good food.Keep on Rockin' in the free world."}, {"review_id": "Pm2t-YjjsRnaD3BIuxMdjQ", "user_id": "f-Ifm8NjQFpwleOE7Um4Rw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Our waiter was kind and attentive--first rate.

It's one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten in. Let's start with the ambience. Smooth jazz as background music, beautiful décor that's inviting and calming at the same time, so one does not have to rush eating. The service was impeccable. The waitress came right away and help me sift through the menu to put together a vegetarian dish since I am vegan. The chef sent over a delicate salad with frisee lettuce, thinly julienned carrots, some other types of greens and tiny crunchy roasted seeds of some sorts that all melted in the mouth. Alongside was perfectly cooked and seasoned asparagus. Later came the wild mushroom risotto, another dish that was cooked to perfection.I had a wonderful, palate-pleasing experience that was delicate, tasty and not over filling. Highly recommend it."}, {"review_id": "zxPKTByQLamfQA2N94SEvQ", "user_id": "OY1PwbIbNvm_rALKna9noA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Not your typical hotel restaurant.

This is hands down the best meal I have had while in Minnesota.. I started with the crab cake and it was pure crab meat so so so filled with flavor and for dinner I had the Insginia Scallops, blow your mind amazing perfectly cooked and so so so flavorful. The only thing is there was no side dish that came with the scallops and I feel for 37.00 for an entree it should have at least one side and it needed something a rice or potato some kind of scratch. My waiter Jeffery was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu, he provided excellent customer service"}, {"review_id": "VJCIm65Yw8pA0VKKwAHOug", "user_id": "EjzUbdaVaoFw3zCp0T2rjw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/12/2017", "text": "Ambience is pretty casual for an upscale establishment. Superb service from the server.The lobster bisque was expectedly good. Just right.The filet mignon with the additional side order of scallops is pricey but worth it. The filet mignon was cooked just right. So tender and so so juicy and the size was HUGE. Very generous portions for the upscale restaurant. The scallop were amazingly pan seared on one side but still so...it just melted away in my mouth!Hub's Icelandic Artic Char was also moist and delish!!! Bread pudding for dessert. Highly recommend because we wanted to lick the plate. We didn't but I know we both thought about it. Well, okay. I definitely thought about licking all the plates. I only deducted a star because the scallops were slightly over charred. Huge scallops and it made me sad that the charring took away from the experience."}, {"review_id": "C0jBdQggJ_fwNChcE4ZeWQ", "user_id": "rsQWeMSICVUip-pNazzsgw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "So disappointed. I had been looking forward to eating at Pescara. The service was both slow and rushed. Took forever to have the order taken, forever for the appetizer to arrive, and forever again to receive the worst scallops I've EVER been served in my life (and I'm no spring chicken.).   The scallops were dull grey instead of that beautiful luminescent pearl color one expects.  And they were served in a sauce based with some type of terrible oil - completely inedible.  Save yourself!  The kale salad, once received was pretty good and the restaurant is beautiful."}, {"review_id": "gtXzixZEkK_WF6kIUUWczg", "user_id": "FTY-5YX_sMGpyNpZP6Txaw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "A must when I'm in town.

I am usually not very excited about this trip (who would be excited about going to a hospital), but it is less awful knowing that I will be able to eat at Pescara!! I love their concept-- you order the fish (selection of daily \"fish\" that are all fresh), and then you choose how you want it cooked, and what marinade/sauce you'd like it cooked with. You can then choose whatever side you'd like.  The fish is always cooked just right, and the servers always have great suggestions as to what to pair it with. If you can go with more than just yourself to Pescara, do it, so you can order more of the sides to share. I usually order the Brussels sprouts and I love them, but the asparagus is also really good!Overall, Pescara is consistently good, and a surprisingly great restaurant for being a hotel restaurant. I highly recommend it, but make reservations as I've seen it get busy. The service is great, with servers who are attentive when you need them, but not allover you constantly that they just bug you to death! See you next year, Pescara!"}, {"review_id": "-cNZ83yXIoZ_X_YK5U2G8Q", "user_id": "ZqB271uTh0KrrbIL5bzCqw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "I liked Pescara but I think it's a little overpriced for what it is.

I have had multiple breakfast & brunch buffets as well as dinner once. I am glad I found this place which made my stay in rochester little more pleasing. I will break down the crucial points about Pescara below -:1. Location - easily accessible through skyway from neighboring downtown hotels. 2. Breakfast - is only $12 which is a great deal if you consider the quality of food they provide which includes  the usual sausage,ham, bacon and scrambled eggs. Their gouda hash brown is very popular and really tasty. They also have chef-styled eggs,biscuits with sausage gravy. Fruit bar, juices, multiple bread collection. Best part - they provide freshly made buttermilk pancakes, french toast and waffles which are very sumptous. 3. Brunch buffet (Sunday 10-2, only 17$) - This is a steal as per my point of view, they have the usual breakfast menu plus some delicious add-ons. They have smoked salmon (nice), shrimp ravioli and best of them all lobster bisque. Too good to be true right, wait there's more they provide chocolate torte and bread pudding as desserts and trust me both are superb.4. Dinner - I ordered cioppino and it was very delicious. It comes with variety of seafood in a tomato gravy and it was very pleasant to my taste buds. Finally I ordered a chocolate torte which equally good. Dinner can be a bit pricey, but food is great. Writing about all these dishes has made me hungry. You should check this place out, You would love it."}, {"review_id": "mJnctXt15T1GXM_tBO8Dug", "user_id": "ymVB9uYVgclg417KDSPYqw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "We were really looking forward to this meal. I had an appointment at Mayo, of course. After a long week of tests and such, we were hungry for some good seafood and this was said to be the place. Settled in and had a superb cocktail and lobster bisque. This was truly fantastic and, if we had stopped here, we would be giving it five stars. Next we shared a Caesar salad with plenty of anchovies. This, too, was excellent. Lightly sauced and the anchovies were mild and delicious. The main course was where the wheels let go. We order the $38 halibut to share. It arrived with a fuss and the server just dumped it on the table with two plates. Said he thought we'd want to split ourselves. That was a tad rude but not that big of a deal. So we tried the halibut. It was in a fond Blanc sauce. The sauce was quite good but the halibut was over cooked and dried out. They had one thing to do which was to cook the fish right and they blew it. This restaurant is in the Double Tree hotel which maybe the best and most reasonable place to stay in Rochester. So they have a bit of a captive audience. The meal started out so good but we just can't get over how they simply ruined the $38 piece of halibut. It started out so well, I guess I'd give them another try. Next time, I'll tell them if they ruin the main dish, I'm not paying for it."}, {"review_id": "fDMEmq8qsR12vo7jVQnIZw", "user_id": "3d4fac-e3Plyib8QUEmHNg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/7/2017", "text": "This place is a little overrated (at least from their express menu).  I have been here a few times during lunch, and nothing's really ever jumped out at me.  Tuna Sandwich:  Nothing really to write about.  I was expecting more since it's a fish place, but it was just a standard tuna sandwich I could have made at home.Lobster Bisque: Too thick, but not terrible.  The flavor was good, but really it was just too thick.Tacos: I got this because I have heard people raving about it.  I didn't see what all the hype was about, but I am from Texas so my standards of tacos are a little higher.  I think they needed a better salsa to pull it all together.  I wouldn't rush out to eat here again."}, {"review_id": "7G1VulvuhE26ZkG35qoRKg", "user_id": "QDzMM2YcB0LDLJVHDqrz3g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "Ive been here a few times.

Had Salmon and another local fish, (don't remember the name) which was excellent. Small tossed salad to share was great and plenty for two. The tuna tartare that we both ordered, never came so can't review. Suddenly the main course showed up and when we asked about the tuna, waiter apologized that he forgot. I asked if we could get any sides right away with our main course as we didn't order based on the fact that we were having an appetizer. Was told we could get the side of mushrooms right away. Wrong. After trying for ten minutes to get the waiters attention, (he paid attention to every table but ours) the mushrooms arrived after our meal was finished.

I've always enjoyed coming here. It was never my idea to pick pescara as I think there are more exciting restaurants in Rochester but I go with the flow. I've never had anything I absolutely loved here and the ambiance is a little stuffy for my idea of a good time, I like more casual places. We came with a birthday party of 8 people. They have a new chef with a changed menu. My go to crab salad is gone, as is the ever popular seafood platter.I had the lobster bisque this time and it was pretty good. My husband and fellow Elite had the halibut with a side of Brussels sprouts. Which came with a hunk load of bacon- which we don't eat, and don't expect from a traditionally vegetarian side. Anyway the waiter took it back but was rather rude about it. It still appeared on the bill, although no one took a single bite out of it.. We inquired about that and the server's answer was \"you ordered it so you pay for it\". I wonder, if we had said we didn't like the taste and took the dish back, would it still appear on the bill and we would still get this treatment? I highly doubt the same treatment would have applied if here were middle aged in a suit that night. For a place as classy and overpriced as pescara we expected more - better service and dishes that wow. Failed on both accounts. Thank you Pescara, but we will not be returning, and definitely not bringing any out of town visitors here. Luckily Rochester has a lot of other options where you leave with more pleasant experience."}, {"review_id": "tiGtWAomeYScF2w4-9WtbA", "user_id": "BJndoZ1Zr6x1AST-5d8HAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "We arrived at the Doubletree today and decided to dine at Pescara due to the convenience and the reviews. Well folks, this is a no brainer, if you are visiting Rochester, going to the Mayo Clinic or live here treat yourself to a delightful experience. Trenton was our server and did not disappoint. He was faster than a speeding bullet, everything was delivered at record speed and was exactly as described. He was very knowledgeable and was so accommodating when requests were made for dietary restrictions, so friendly which made our experience so much more enjoyable. We had the ahi tuna tartare and a salad, quinoa veggie salad all of which were delicious. We would have tried other fabulous options but pre-test restrictions prohibited us from doing so, going back tomorrow night. The restaurant is very pretty, if you plan ahead reserve one of the tables with comfy chairs on window. All the staff were wonderful! Run, don't walk to Pescara to have a nice evening.
