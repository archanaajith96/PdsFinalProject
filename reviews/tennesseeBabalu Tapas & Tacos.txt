We were in a rush and they provided us with appropriate seating to get us in and out as quickly as possible but clearly did not compromise a morsel of the food. Can't say enough good things about this place. We sampled a few things and love them. We have a Pescatarian in the family and he was happy with the variety of food on the menu as well as the carnivores."}, {"review_id": "2xuD61lHzX3L-cIPnwg_QA", "user_id": "SJNWe0Fw_s6X5I41TKd1wg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "If it had not been for the wait on my dining partners food I would of given a five star rating. This being said we did arrive at 5:30 this evening (Friday).PRO: We started with the calamari appetizer. The texture was perfect. The flavor was great. Go lightly on the sauce served on the side. The flavor was wonderful but can be overpowering if used in excess. We ordered thee tacos. 1) Carnitas 2) Carne de Cerdo 3) Camarones. All thee were delicious. The grilled shrimp was my favorite.The sweet potato fries were impressive. They were fried and salted perfectly. This is the only time I have had sweet potato fried that I liked.The lamb sliders were amazing. The perfect mixture of spicy and sour. The toasted buns gave the sliders a nice texture.CON:  The wait for a table was twice as long as we were quoted.The lamb sliders took almost an hour to get to the table. All other food had been consumed for quite a. While before they arrived.Our server (Sophia) was delightful. She was visible stressed about the amount of time the sliders took. She sent over a manager (Dee) without being asked. He was also very apologetic. He removed the sliders from our bill and offered dessert. We did not take him up on dessert. Normally with the wait time I would of given this establishment a two star rating. However, with the amazing quality of food and service I had to give it four stars. This is a shame. I would of loved to give them 5 stars."}, {"review_id": "G8syNGQTVZ8EW7Lp_18rOQ", "user_id": "YzGDHAhPJX_xc6wzWsPmzg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "I've had the catering from Babalu a few times. It has always been good, but until recently I hadn't been to the restaurant. I remedied that on a recent Taco Tuesday when I started fixating on table side guacamole.The place was pretty packed, but our party of 5 was seated quickly inside.We started with the guacamole, but did not add jalapenos or bacon. We did get an order of fresh veggies to dip, which is a nice option to offer.The guacamole was awesome and the fresh, warm chips were wonderful.I ordered the daily Margarita - a strawberry sriracha version that was fresh and not too sweet.For my entree, I got a taco special - one grilled red fish and one vegetable, with a side salad. The fish taco was good, but the one big piece of fish was harder to eat than, say, shredded. The veggie taco had intense flavor and was my favorite.Service was friendly, but a bit slow."}, {"review_id": "8WdAjzKx54LRUQk4qroz7w", "user_id": "7Ogw1uT6k7vkf1xOtmNuUQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Great guacamole and nice veggie and seafood taco options. I'm not a fan of the tortillas. They're bland and don't hold anything inside the taco. $2 Taco Tuesday isn't a bad deal if you don't have a problem with the tacos. Thea served water to animals on the patio from the same container she served our table.  It wouldn't have been a huge deal if the dog didn't lick the glass serving container.

The pictures looked great so I decided to try it out. The location is great! The service was amazing and the prices are good (came in Tuesday and they had $2 tacos). The food was not my favorite. We got the guac, the melted cheese, calamaries (were good), soup of the day--cheeseburger soup, and several tacos. The tacos were not very tasty. I tried 3 different tacos and would probably suggest the pollo or redfish."}, {"review_id": "Bt7Li-xNYYKE4tznM5Rlww", "user_id": "Tm_-fewsHX9leG6ijxh69w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Came here to celebrate some accomplishments, and I'm glad I tried it. I really like the design of the place and the seating was real cool. Now the food... I ordered the cheeseburger soup of the day and it was WoW! And the cheese queso was also very good with some chips. After that I ordered guacamole, which they make in front of you and that was delicious. Now the tacos I thought needed some work because the braised beef was definitely missing flavor and the shrimp was missing flavor. I'd prefer the fried chicken taco and the fish taco, but the braised beef I couldn't even finish it just bland. It's a very good place to come get some drinks hang out with friends, I would definitely be back but I would order other stuff off the menu to try I would skip the tacos. Another reason I would be back is because of the service, the people here are fantastically nice and attentive!"}, {"review_id": "DNNRvMihrmL4oHc21KKLFw", "user_id": "K4CrSL9qIOBGeM-2Xm-F4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Loved the ambiance of this restaurant!

As I planted my keister in the seat, I was greeted by the familiarity of some friends. Myself and one other girl at the table had never been here before.The server was Lex and she was very kind and helpful, she even provided bottle service for us (even though it was just water).The guacamole is their true calling card, everyone donates their kidney to have just a drop of this stuff. It's ten dollars per cauldron and they make it in front of you.All in all I give four stars and I challenge you to try it out and see what you think."}, {"review_id": "4HudkHsOQV5r3kInup7rIQ", "user_id": "ma9t1nYaDCH7pjTPJ9zhNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Our service was excellent (during a busy lunch day for them).

As a downtown resident, I'll often pop in to local places and get lunch to-go on my way to work and had yet to give Babalu a shot.I was really pleased with their lunch options; there were several great choices and all were reasonably priced. I had heard good things about the Baba-Burger, so I landed on that with a chopped salad on the side. My order was taken and delivered quickly, and it also included a little bag of chips, which I thought was a really nice addition. I'm giving three stars because, although the flavors were excellent, there were menu elements missing from the burger (forgot the caramelized onions and only one very small bit of avocado)  and it was pretty overcooked (well, plus). Lunch was decent but kinda missed the mark for me."}, {"review_id": "_Q_8UfuOrbPdtQsxhl4Ixw", "user_id": "Scf0XhaRwqae8Ng9rs2bQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I'm surprised this restaurant isn't a 5 Star!

Our server, Claire, was spot on but what she had to deal with was beyond annoying for us as diners.  We went in for a beer and the touted Guacamole, when we began asking about beers, she had to advise us that MOST of the beers were at the bottom of the tap and each one we asked about was out.  We finally found one, each, that was available and ordered a 14oz apiece.  We ordered, the Guacamole was made, and we had completed the app and never saw a beer.  Claire came back several times apologizing for the delay and let us know there were 9 tickets ahead of us.  We finally cancelled the beer, she apologized implicitly for the drinks never getting to the table, understand this was 25-30 min after ordering, no drinks.No apology from any manager, whatsoever, no one other than Claire having to bare the brunt of an obviously mismanaged, unstocked, high priced - very average restaurant.Needless to say, this diner will not be returning to Babalu to be ignored again.

So I stopped in for a quick bite during Happy Hour. Cam was the bartender and he is excellent. I started with the seasonal margarita which was a mix of five citrus juices served on the rocks with salt. It was light, refreshing and simply Devine. So I had two! FYI, the happy hour prices are fantastic! I ordered the table side guacamole which was so fresh and delicious. One of the ingredients was sundries tomatoes which I had never seen before. I also had the carnitas and grilled shrimp tacos. OMG they were amazing. I wish I wasn't leaving town because I would eat here again tomorrow! The presentation of all the food was really well done and the taco seasoning was tangy with a little spice. A perfect balance!

It was citrusy and just a little sweet.  Yum. And then there is the bread pudding,  my love, accompanied by coffee-flavored whipped cream.
