I ordered a small Sweet Carolina pizza with sweet local Italian sausage, sweet pepper, mozzarella and ricotta.  As wonderful as the toppings were, the crust was a real treat...thin and with a nice outer edge.  I was not drinking, but there was an interesting craft beer selection.  This will be a stop next time I am in town."}, {"review_id": "LWZjIfLfsCtxrQgWxAdXvw", "user_id": "uHWoMSw-4X9zwzVbouFnDA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Sticks and Stones is a Jekyl and Hyde kind of place for me... I have had both great experiences and bad experiences over time, so it has to average out to three stars overall. This is in both food and service. On busy nights, it is downright deafening in there, and usually at this time the pizza quality goes down a bit. More likely to get a partially burnt crust on the bottom, which I understand is part of their \"style\" of pizza, but sometimes it gets excessive. I have had much better experiences at lunch, when there aren't so many people jockeying around the bar.They do have a lot of interesting pizzas and toppings, and some of their appetizers are original and delicious. In particular, they have some very good chicken wings, and the fries are the tops. They do use seemingly fresh ingredients, which drives up the price tag a bit, but it isn't unreasonable by any means. It only feels that way if you happen to come on a bad pizza day.This duality makes it not one of my favorite places to go, but sometimes when I end up there I'm glad I came. Again, I suggest a lunch trial for your first time."}, {"review_id": "c_eYrC9uez0NZjIZIqvwPg", "user_id": "0UGF6LE3b68IzOhXfEYYGg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Had a very poor experience at this restaurant.  Me and my party put our names down with the host and got a 30 minute time estimate.  When we came back 25 minutes later to see how much longer we were told our name was never put down and there was no way to accommodate us.  We ended up going to Lindley Park Filling Station across the street which was great.  I'd recommend that over our experience at Sticks & Stones."}, {"review_id": "8_VysTHpz9pjQPk_0jaO5A", "user_id": "oE61jYul-FJSCoJrITosWw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Another beautiful day another day on my motorcycle. If you own a motorcycle you'll understand if not you don't know what your missing.

Stocks & Stones is more then pizza, you can get a salad, burgers or breakfast, who knew. I ordered a small sweet Carolina pizza.

This is one of the new style of pizza joint, gourmet or whatever term you favor, all kinds of \"toppings\" (I expect M & Ms and Captain Crunch to be a choices soon, if not here, then elsewhere), mix and match approach, and a variety of weird, specialty pies that many will swear they find delightful and tasty, with an amazing, new depth of flavor - food version of the Emperor's New Clothes - all it needs is the latest craft beer, perhaps something with a hint of turmeric, or better yet, lacquered pea shoots!This is not a place where you you have a relaxed comfortable meal - the place is small, it is prone to be noisy, and the tables and chairs are not at all comfortable, and some are more than a little unsteady. The service is a bit unfocused, even when the table population is rather light - you know, still getting things ready to open 20 minutes after you're open!We went with a small Margherita Pizza, and a daily special - a slice of Pepperoni Pizza and a salad with Blue Cheese Dressing. Thought maybe the salad would come out first, but it all kinda lazied out together, a few ticks on the slow side. The Pepperoni slice was nice, but not exceptional, and the salad was nicely busy - sprouts, seeds, carrot, radish, and several types of greens - you know the kind, looks very healthy until you load on the Blue Cheese. Seriously though, I liked the salad - would just suggest that the salad be on one plate and the pizza slice on another, that way you don't end up with Blue Cheese on your pizza, or pepperoni in your healthy salad!The Margherita was a bit of a fail - while the overall taste was good, the cheese had not melted enough to adhere to the crust, thus movement was an issue, a matter of eating on the run almost. All in all, not enough good here to make a serious statement for returning - going with 3 stars but feeling a little shaky!"}, {"review_id": "2zZsmY73tFh3A1GFy1RiAw", "user_id": "VnHK0vcO2FbFxHzaJ7ZCEQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "I've only been here twice so far, once for lunch and once for dinner.Lunch: ordered the lunch special (you pick 2 style) - I went with the dance all night & fries (only reason I didn't get a slice is because I am also having pizza for dinner tonight, but I should have gotten a slice anyway...regrets). Dance all night was fine, but way too much dressing. If you get this, beware you should ask for dressing on the side. Fries were 7/10 - loved the rosemary flavor but the fries are on the skinnier side, which I am not a huge fan of. Total bill: $7.42 (and you can get soda or tea with that pick 2 lunch special).Dinner: I came with a group of family friends on a Friday night - got here around 9 pm (or later). The hostess said it would be a bit before we got seated, but we ended up being called within 5 minutes. We got drinks and lots of pizzas to try/share. Great beer selection! I loved all of the pizzas I tasted, so I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. I loved the magnolia mountain. Pros: Lots of unique pizza options for people who love pizza / have adventurous palates. Great beer options. Outdoor seating available! Cons: Salads are meh and if darkness bothers you, it was super dark inside during our Friday night dinner."}, {"review_id": "8yMawHur_TIwT0eAta2baw", "user_id": "q1kbqjao7jHcorNlUZ8gGw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "I love this pizza place, its local and it has a very relaxed atmosphere.I ordered the Firecracker and expected to have a little spice, so I was let down there, but other than that the pizza was still amazing.

The names of the food were fun!!!!! The Rip Off, A Kiss Before I Go, Heartbreaker, etc.  2 Suggestions -The outdoor furniture wasn't safe!  The table we sat at had a broken piece of wood and the back of a nail sticking out.  The 2 tables weren't leveled.  One had a stack of coaster and napkins under it.  As for the other table, our friend had to put his foot underneath it until we could get a big stack of napkins to put under it! -The food was tasty, but the very last item to get to the table was the salad!!! I felt like my pizza was dry and could've used more shallot cream sauce.  The chicken on it was dry as well and I had to get a side of ranch to put on top. The ranch seemed home made and it was delicious!1 Overall ReviewOverall, we enjoyed our experience at Sticks and Stones.  We hope they consider replacing the tables so that way no one gets injured!  We had delicious food and a fast/friendly staff."}, {"review_id": "UtRCNCJBfgSRBORADJZ-Zw", "user_id": "3-u-McIwzrsoq_Aas6W0Yw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Great atmospheres and deliciously wonderful pizza!
