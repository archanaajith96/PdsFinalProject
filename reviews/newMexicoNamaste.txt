Anyway, my non-ET parter and I were hungry for some Indian food... flavors of this world.  SO, we rolled up to Namaste.  I expected to find maybe a Yoga class or something but it was just food.We were greeted by a nice man and given great recommendations about the food. We got two kinds of Tikka Masala - lamb and chicken. We did a blind taste test (ask the waiter not to tell you which dish is which. Trust me.) We could def tell which was which. Great food, awesome prices, yaaas."}, {"review_id": "tMeJdVBt1azQMZd5YmkhPw", "user_id": "_gFjmSSnpHjiK19n6lUfUQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Great buffet.

The staff was wonderfully friendly and accommodating. The interior was lovely, and as for the food...mahvelous! Larry suggested I go for the buffet, and I was not disappointed.Fresh and bright flavors, the meatballs were SO JUICY....I filled up my plate with noodles, namo, spinach pakora....and the chicken makhani was absolute aces!!! Lots of vegetarian options, the naan bread was deeeelish, and the accompanying condiments were perfection. Love me some tamarind.It makes me so happy to have such a great place to indulge my indian/nepali cravings here on this side of the grid. There will be many more visits here, you can count on that!"}, {"review_id": "f1csCFFt65Iw4hYGKVzxxw", "user_id": "APx20b9etKLY0HDovgSrMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/1/2017", "text": "As we walked in, we were welcomed with a warm greeting, Namaste, a sweet smile by Sandhya Gurung, and heavenly aromas wafting from the kitchen. Namaste means \"I bow and respect to the divine spirit within you,\" used in India and Nepal to greet each other. The term has many meanings -- my favorite is, \"I honor the Spirit in you which is also in me.\"Namaste Cuisine of India and Nepal was started August 2008 by Shree Prasad Gurung, his charming wife, Sandhya, and brother-in-law Hem. This family-run restaurant is the first Indian and Nepalese restaurant in the Duke City area. The room is quite lovely, the staff quite friendly, and the service is exemplary. But this is true of many Indian restaurants here. What sets Namaste apart from the pack is the food, and that's why we go there.Aah, the food! The spicing is delicate and the sauces are complex -- never over-the-top shouting at you, \"I'm Indian, therefore cayenne-hot.\" The balance is so close to being perfect that you can taste everything -- amazing in this Enchanted Land of Chile.The menu is not so huge as to be overwhelming. But you will surely find your favorites here. Chicken, lamb or goat, seafood, biryanis, vegetables, and much more. Tandoori, korma, vindaloo, tikka masala, and more.The buffet lunch is a fine way to sample many of the dishes on the regular dinner menu. Among my buffet favorites are Saag Paneer (perfect), Chicken Tikka Masala (with dark meat -- my favorite way to prepare this dish), and the Meatballs, which are melt-in-your-mouth tender and as delicious as anything Indian you are likely to encounter in this city. But nothing's perfect -- the Tandoori Chicken was a tad too dry.I think that Namaste is the very best Indian restaurant in New Mexico. I awarded it my Best Newcomer of 2008 Award and It sits in 8th place on my Albuquerque Top Ten List. Consistently great."}, {"review_id": "vnn3uV5F28sWko8lUgXF-Q", "user_id": "XZA4Wdt_EoLtiSxeSkXg4w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "I visited Namaste on a weekday lunch to try the lunch buffet, as I've been looking for a good Indian buffet in Albuquerque. I got there a little early for the lunch rush and the restaurant was mostly empty with a very friendly waitress.The buffet was a bit limited on variety, but everything I had was very good. The price was also lower than expected for a buffet, and everything seemed pretty fresh.Overall a good choice for lunch on a workday, especially since it's fast and inexpensive."}, {"review_id": "fSS4ocSxvE6OKp1Z1GVf_g", "user_id": "NWThWdXtMNxDZ-K_p-hPzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/26/2017", "text": "My husband I love to eat here!

Namaste's food is authentic, delicious, and out does half of the places I tried in my travels. Their buffet items change daily, and you can see their daily buffet menu on their website. They have a large variety of vegetarian dishes that are so complex and delicious with their assorted spices and flavors. It's easy to understand how so many people in India are vegetarian. They also have this pickle mix that is a must try. It has ingredients like lime rinds and okra and though you might not think that sounds appealing, it's an amazing accompaniment to their dishes.        They also have these little donut things called gulab jamun that I'm addicted to. Every time I eat these, it takes me back to my visits to India and the little quaint bakeries that I frequented after falling in love with this dessert. One time I bought seven dozen of these things and packed them in my suitcase... and they don't travel well. They are made with milk, so you can't really keep them unrefrigerated for two days of travel. Anyways, gulab jamun are the size of donut holes, but much heavier and are soaked in a light rose water and cardamon syrup that I would drink if I knew nobody would see me doing it. They don't have them everyday, but if they have them out you should try them.      I wish they had a breakfast buffet even just on the weekends. Indian breakfast is to die for and I think it would go over good here."}, {"review_id": "dKyRdcKOhVuWp1__2bAtHQ", "user_id": "cJ3PnIsfYFhC0RRVdHKbPg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/20/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've been here about six times, and it's always been lovely. Today I went with my three-year old son. Normally, kids are free. When I got the bill, there was a $5 charge for his meal, and so I inquired of the woman who brought it kindly, stating that he's always been free before. Maybe she thought he was older than he is. She then proceeded to scold me, that his original plate of food was too big, and that because he didn't eat it, it was waste, so she charged $5. She took it off, but continued to make scolding comments. I took all of one plate of food. So did he. Neither of us went back for seconds. On his plate, there was a very small portion of a variety of different items. It was a lot of food. But it's also the way you introduce new foods to toddlers- expose them to different tastes and have them eat it and figure out what they like. As it was, he ate all his bread, pakora, aloo gobi and dessert, half of his paneer, and left most of the rest.Again, it was a single plate of food. I ate only one plate of food. Are adults charged extra for leaving food on the plate? For multiple plates? Are they shamed for waste? I loved this restaurant, but I won't go back to this location because of the scolding and self-consciousness."}, {"review_id": "ksCfKnQCNk0WcezcQdhBBQ", "user_id": "pTfMD_JrBFgFbMt2e2ixlQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/23/2017", "text": "Decent food but a little pricey for nothing amazing.
