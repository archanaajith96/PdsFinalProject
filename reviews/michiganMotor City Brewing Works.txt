Located in downtown Detroit, this building is KIND of difficult to find, but don't give up. They have plenty of parking options and the inside is very cozy. I tried three of their beers (all were around $4.50 - amazing price) and loved each one. I had the Honey Porter, Ghettoblaster and their IPA - the Honey Porter ended up being my personal favorite.They also offer up a delicious menu. We didn't end up eating there, but I was told that their pizza is superb! So the next time I'm back I'll definitely be giving it a try."}, {"review_id": "BQOIojd8WNq_XkbXXUkiOg", "user_id": "MEYWD3nf64p3INCsJ5KOaA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Canfield Street, between Cass and 2nd, and just a 9-iron off the Wayne State campus, has become quite the hip strip as Detroit transforms itself from the ground up.  Shinola's flagship is here...the Jolly Pumpkin is here...Royale with Cheese is on the next block and other interesting shops are popping up out of nowhere.  In this same block, set back a bit from the street behind a parking lot you'll find a great little craft brewery (and winery???) with a menu full of some very creative tomato pies. It's a small place with maybe a dozen chairs at the bar and another six or seven 4-tops tables. This Friday lunch hour, it seemed like every seat was occupied by 12:20 pm by regulars and others who keep the Motor City Brewing Works in their regular lunch rotation. My colleague chose the BBQ Chicken pie while and I created an interesting custom pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, double red onions, Quattro Formaggi and a tasty Tomato Herb sauce. The pies came with fresh and outstandingly tasty ingredients. The pepperoni, clearly showed it's pedigree by curling up in small, quarter-sized half round cups like only quality 'roni can. The mild Italian sausage carried a pleasingly sweet taste. The 'Works' also offers its own brews and even some wines they craft locally although we didn't sample the libations on this visit. Cool place in mid-town...I'll be back to try a different specialty pie next time."}, {"review_id": "7l5dFkeVBEZ174sY9B_uXQ", "user_id": "koyt5zJLVI6W4c_bLxX5JQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Really enjoyed my stop at this place after catching some March Madness Games at LCA. This place is a little tucked away, but it's got a cool vibe and looks like it has some outdoor seating when the weather is nice. We sat at the bar so we could watch more basketball, and had an overall great experience. TONS of good beverage options here. Whatever your preference, there are sure to be a few options that work for you. We tried three food items: The wings, the hot crab dip, and a pizza (The Godfather). Everything is done in the oven as they don't have a fryer on the premises. To me, this made everything taste great. The pizza is delicious. They are all personal size pizzas, but you can share if you're feeling generous. The crab dip is really good with a nice little kick. It comes with some toasted bread. The staff will gladly give you more bread at no extra $$$ if you need to scrape the bottom of the barrel. The wings were also very good. They were large and the sauce had great flavor. Everything is very fairly priced. So if you're ballin' on a budget, this is a good option."}, {"review_id": "LGf4eD-Dg_McAnZlTMjd-Q", "user_id": "pD7rL5MWRk_GURxoMYnstg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Very unique little spot in Detroit. My boyfriend and I can stopped by here recently for a drink and a snack. The place was PACKED! However, we got a solid spot at the front bar which was lovely. The bartender that served us should really have his own reality TV show, he was quite the character. I took a star off because of the beer selection. A little weak and not too many options on tap in my opinion."}, {"review_id": "-_x6MsrnuDna7h65zQsm4w", "user_id": "wzy_B0nc9qseyrlZLH6PIA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Walking through midtown we heard some music..we followed our ears to an opening.  Looking inward we could see a guitar player in the distance.

Highly recommend the Motor City Mule - fresh ginger taste and micro-fizzy delight. The pizzas are imaginative, delicious, and very quickly prepared.

The weather was really nice out and they have a pretty awesome outdoor patio with plenty of picnic tables. There was plenty of room for our large group on a Friday night. They also have a rooftop patio that a couple of my friends checked out too. You order your beer inside and can bring it outside with you. If you order food, they give you a number and bring it out to your table. They have indoor seating as well. They have lots of great tasting beers. I had the honey porter which was tasty. Most of their beers are lower ABV, Ghettoblaster, their most popular beer is only 3.8%, and most are around 5%. Some of my friends tried the Amber Saison, IPA, and Bohemian Lager. The Belgian Tripel sounds interesting, brewed with rock candy and is their highest ABV beer at 9.2 %. Most of us already had dinner before at Traffic Jam but a few members of our party got there later after work and ordered pizza which looked and smelled phenomenal. I will definitely have to come back to try their pizza. Great beer, awesome outdoor patio in the summer, and great location in the heart of Midtown, not too far from Jolly Pumpkin, Bronx, Traffic Jam and Old Miami."}, {"review_id": "8FQ1zIV7x4fVIxlH4CY7hg", "user_id": "d6HqHX-L5ooVjlVMqRlJFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/17/2017", "text": "Beer is yummy!

The chalkboard has several seasonal options that are not on the regular menu. Not sure if they do flights, but if you're into good beer you've got a table of healthy people who want to taste everything... get one of each and have a communal tasting.Their pizza menu has some flavorful highlights including Mary Did Have and the Roasted Pear & Fig, which is especially appealing to Gorgonzola lovers. If none of the pizzas appeal to you, you can always build your own.What's cool is that produce used on the pizzas and in the salads is grown nearby at the North Casa Community Garden."}, {"review_id": "-0HUtbLH_vZ515vvGMwdow", "user_id": "f2ba-VDOpatAnuDef-KlKQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "Hmm interesting layout of a place was the first thing that came to our mind. At first, we parked on the street, but didn't realize we could just park in the parking lot right up to their entrance (there was an available space). Go here in the early afternoon, before many people were there... it was pretty dead. A hostess came over and greeted us, and we asked about sitting outside, but never mentioned the upstairs outdoor patio, so we decided on the bar at first. We ordered a pitcher of beer, and then were talking about possibly sitting outside (beautiful day in Detroit). The bartender informed us about the upstairs seating (full service) and we looked at each other wondering why the hostess never offered that area to us. Idk, the whole interaction just seemed weird at first.Anyways, we walked upstairs and sat down (the hostess didn't take us up there no doubt). At first, this really skinny guy with super tight and very, very casual clothes walked by the table and said \"hey guys, how's it going\"?, and we responded normally as anyone would, but honestly I didn't even think he was our server based on what he was wearing and how awkward he seemed. Then a girl came out a second later, and that's how we knew they were both our servers (he was being trained I'm assuming). Anyways, the whole entire dining experience, the male server was super awkward and just didn't seem to know how to interact with guests well, but regardless, our food and drinks were great. The two pizzas we ordered were delicious, but I do wish they had an option to have one large pizza instead of ordered more individual-type pizzas. It just makes more sense for those who want to split a pizza. Also, during the course of our meal, he would forget to bring out water (even when we had to ask) as well as some other few things that I can't remember right now.I did like the seating upstairs, but wish it was a little bigger and had more going on up there. There wasn't any type of music going on, and it just seemed like such a dead place. Maybe it's because of the time we came at, I'm not sure... but it just wasn't lively! Oh, I also found the water glasses to be a little funny since they were so tiny! Talk about a classic hipster nouveau type ordeal where water glasses are practically a large shot glass. Just make them bigger and normal sized for crying out loud!"}, {"review_id": "dSnJ1oa-rDJLmdcxGw8X9w", "user_id": "jDeXeAYn4pcpQZS6ZxdqIw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/31/2017", "text": "If youre wondering whether or not to go here or Jolly Pumpkin theres no debate, GO HERE. Check my review on that place if you want to know why I don't recommend them. I usually drop by here to have a Ghettoblaster and a Mary did have. Ive had almost every pie on the menu and theyre all good. The pear and fig is pretty amazing as well. They also have some good appetizers too depending on what you get, and they also rotate a few in and out from time to time. I love that they have olive oil, red pepper, oregano, parmesan, salt and pepper on the table so you can dress the pizza how you want. I wouldnt recommend coming around dinner on the weekends because for one they have extremely limited parking that they share with Traffic Jam, and two, it's fairly small so theres usually nowhere to sit and when you can, its kind of cramped. But their beers are A1, try the summer brew when they have it! Waitstaff is usually cool, sometimes not, depends who you get. I wouldn't bother with the wines, beer is what they're good at here!"}, {"review_id": "QTTGK7W0_NdnZJNPiI-fYA", "user_id": "3FnJJ4SGtHOWUuuv0v0z7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/3/2018", "text": "A friend treated me to a giftcard so we stopped here for a late lunch before heading over to the Pistons game.

I think that speaks to how popular and how great this place is. We were seated at the bar area, which was actually cool because we had a direct line view of the pizzas being prepared and baked. We ordered 2 pizzas: Mary Did Have and Sopla Fuego. And we also got the artichoke dip. I loved the unique pizza combinations offered here...and you also have the opportunity to build your own pie. The Sopla Fuego is absolutely AMAZING. Do not let the topping list scare you (i.e. habanero sauce, jalopenos). It isn't spicy at all! Mind you, I love spicy so I may not be as sensitive to heat as others, but yeah, try this! Mary Did Have was also really tasty. We loved the dip...the bread was toasted perfectly...not hard at all. Great experience!There is free parking behind the restaurant. It is a little strip of parking lot located right off Prentis. If you can't find it, you can definitely park on the street (metered)."}, {"review_id": "9hDjR0VAz_CqwyWQoXsQsQ", "user_id": "L3pN1Q8vunD9MJeoVRbT6g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "Good pizza and Beer place.
