He was our server and he definitely knows his business at the Yard House. This was our first visit and we had tons of questions about the food & drinks menu, house favorites. Tyree was knowledgeable and patient, taking time to answer all our questions and making recommendations based on a few of his favs! Tyree was professional, personable, articulate and very attentive, despite that fact that he was covering multiple tables on this busy evening. There were so many options to choose from, but at Tyree's suggestions, after he inquired about our likes and dislikes, the Mrs selected the Jambalaya and I had the Nashville Chicken!Boy oh boy, were we impressed with both dishes. Tyree stated that their Jambalaya was bursting with flavors and he was right. The fluffy jasmine rice topped a very flavorful, spicy combination of shrimp, sausage, and crawfish! I had fried boneless chicken with a fried sage garnish with a jalapeño honey syrup that I poured all over and POW, my mouth was in heaven!I really loved this restaurant from the ambiance to the service and food! And you guys know I don't willingly give 5 stars, so I must've been thoroughly impressed! Whelp, Tyree and the chefs behind the scenes made me a fan of the Yard House! I will definitely be back! Until next time, this has been a terrific Fatboy Adventure!"}, {"review_id": "tOa2ePWLDjnZAgmNAzkS2A", "user_id": "KWJ1balzwjmOxtK3hikIGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in the town center.  Almost every time I go, I get the moo shu eggrolls as an appetizer and the brownie or chocolate tort for dessert.

Within a minute or so of being seated, our server Brandi was at the table.  She was great to work with and quick as well.  The first order of business was the drink order.  I had gotten a sweet tea this time and my mom got a ginger ale.  The drinks came back quickly and then asked if we were ready.  Since my brother said to come for the appetizers at happy hour, that's exactly what we did.  We ordered the Onion Ring Tower, Spinach Cheese Dip, Queso Dip, and two orders of the Blue Crab Cakes.  At the time of ordering, I notified our server about my allergy to mushrooms.  A few minutes later, the manager Chris came to the table to check on us and let me know that they checked all the items we ordered had no mushrooms in it and they would avoid cross-contamination, which they did well with.About 10 minutes or so after ordering, the appetizers came out to the table.  The first thing I tried was the Onion Ring Tower.  Those were great, as they weren't hard to chew and were cooked just right.  The next thing I tried was the Spinach Cheese Dip.  This appetizer was amazing.  It tasted great with just spinach and cheese (first time I've had one in a while that didn't have artichokes).  The next thing I ventured to were the Blue Crab Cakes.  They were also amazing.  They were cooked perfectly and they didn't contain fillers that you could find at other places.  The last thing we had gotten that I tried was the Queso.  The Queso was great as well.  They gave you a soft bread and chips to use with it.  After that, I went back and forth enjoying each of the appetizers.As we got full and started slowing down, the manager came back to our table to check on how everything was.   Everything was actually very good and said we could ask for him to check on us when we come back again.  Shortly after, our server came back and asked me which dessert I wanted from my birthday.  I chose the Crème Brûlée.  The dessert was very good and they even had happy birthday on the plate (my birthday was in December, but the coupon was good until January 2nd).  The Crème Brûlée also included bananas, which was a nice touch.Overall, this was a great experience and will definitely come back again.  I look forward to that next visit.  However, I might just stick to water for a drink since the non-alcoholic drink prices are a bit higher than other places.  If you're looking for a nice place to have lunch, happy hour, or dinner in the Town Center area, this place is definitely worth checking out."}, {"review_id": "ixMB63cc2GIqMpG49iN6zQ", "user_id": "qTOPqeg6jkBHqpcLG3JpSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "I've been to Yard House around 6 or 7 times being that it is right around the corner from our place. My husband loves their NY strip sandwich and I love their Parmesan fries and tacos. Today I went with my coworkers on an office appreciation lunch. There were 10 of us and one waitress. Amber helped our table out for lunch today and did a fantastic job. She was attentive, thoughtful, memorable, got the orders correct, and even went above and beyond by knowing what it was we were about to ask or getting us read for the next step of the meal. When she came around to do drink orders, I wanted to know if hey had the angry orchard rose (yes it was for lunch! Don't judge!) As I hadn't tried it but heard great things. She mentioned that it wasn't one of their normal drinks but that there were some new drinks they were debuting Monday and she thought that was one of them. She checked on it and was right about them already having tapped it and I was very happy! It's nice to have someone help you who has a great attitude, is knowledgeable about what's available and what's good, and does it all with a smile. Thanks so much Amber! The whole table loved you :)"}, {"review_id": "xvAqt3wt3-_19_3E2ZLPKw", "user_id": "2GMMS-zN5-e3LVBqPTfDGQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Busy for a Thursday evening, service was fast though, I had a wheat beer, pretty good, and the fish and chips were pretty tasty too.

There are so many food and drink options to choose from. We started with the calamari and the poke nachos. I never order calamari if it's just the rings. Luckily, their version included the crispy tentacles cooked to perfection. The poke nachos were amazing, just enough spice with thinly sliced fresh jalapeños. My only complaint was that I wanted more. My son had the Nashville Hot Chicken which looked like a version of chicken and waffles but served with sweet potato pancakes instead. I had the ahi tuna salad lunch portion which was the perfect size. I can't imagine what the full version of this salad would be like. To end the meal, my son had a mini brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and the words Happy Birthday spelled out for n the plate with cocoa powder.

The texture was gelatinous and the only thing really tolerable was the guacamole on top.My meal was accompanied by rice and beans... or that's what it was supposed to be. The rice was dry and flavorless and I honestly don't have the words to describe the weird beans they served... I tried to mix them together to make it better but it couldn't be helped.

Don't get me wrong, there's no real reason as to why I've been avoiding Yard House. It's more like, I just didn't want to be a part of the yippy trend and hang out at what seems to be the largest pub in Town Center. I'm also not a big fan of chains, for quality reasons. Let me tell you right now, those excuses definitely won't stop me any longer. Every time I manage to go here, the place is always filled with people. I don't think they ever slow down. So keep that in mind if you're not a fan of crowds. It could be a few minutes for you to get a table. especially during the evenings and weekends. Service is usually pretty quick so you don't have to wait with grumbling tummies for too long.So interesting twist, Yard house can be whole30 and paleo compliant! Just gotta make sure you ask to modify their servings up a bit. Also, they are Vegan friendly! Anyways, the food here is pretty great! I usually stick to the appetizer plates since they are pretty big and can fill you up pretty quickly. The poke nachos are so good! Wontons with poke seems so simple but so freaking delicious. Top that with their truffle fries and you're good to continue on with bad choices for the rest of the evening.  I'm not gonna say much about the drinks because there's a ridiculous amount of drinks here. Their mules are awesome! The beer selection is endless. Yard House is really a great place to hang out with friends, catch the game or make new friends with strangers who sings birthday songs for you. It's not the best there is, since their service can sometimes be a hit or miss, but the endless options for drinks and finger foods keeps everyone and their momma coming back!"}, {"review_id": "3kbkOPDZTTTYT3IWYsDL-g", "user_id": "pKqChgMYyB3frqfva6l5eA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I usually get great service from here but that is during the week when everyone is at work.

Wasn't too much of a fan before, (see previous review,) but I guess I was ordering all the wrong things!Still not a fan of shoe string fries, so as much as I love truffle fries (truffle anything, for that matter,) I'll pass on theirs just because they're just too skinny to me. But you know what I did fall in love with? Good Lawd - their Poke Nachos! We ordered sans all the spicy stuff, even though I'm becoming more adventurous and dabbling into spicy foods, because I wanted to try it in its sesame and soy goodness. Everything about this dish is perfect, so I'm gonna order this forever. I mean, each time I come. I also recommend their \"California Roll,\" which is anything but traditional, and oh-so-delicious. See pics!Fiancé usually goes for the small Mac-n-Cheese bowl, which is a good portion! He always gets some type of beer also; he's a fan of craft beers.

I seriously wanted to shine the flashlight app from my phone. I'm like dang, I don't need dark, romantic or nice ambience to tinkle. I would love to come back for the cheaper and awesomely priced reverse happy hour (cheap food and apps after 10pm,) but that's just too late for me to hard core grub.
