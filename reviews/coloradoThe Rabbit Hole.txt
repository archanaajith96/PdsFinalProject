We loved the decor and art, the entire place was done really well!We ordered a lot of things, and it was all amazing.  We had the pork tacos, and an arugula/goat cheese/dried apricots/cashew salad.  Both of these starters were great options!  For a main course, I ordered the filet with the cheddar bacon risotto and asparagus.  I ordered the steak medium, and it came out really over cooked.  They did fix it quickly, and brought me another FULL PLATE!  I will also say, the 2nd steak might have been the best steak I've EVER eaten.  I'm from Texas, not everyone can do a good steak.  This chef NAILED it!  My husband ordered the scallops and risotto, and he opted for the potatoes over broccoli, and his was also perfectly done.  100% will be on our must visit restaurants while in town."}, {"review_id": "NkAaXdiKarkKE4hMVTIjEA", "user_id": "G9P3h7ZGdbdc_Zt6IKC2vQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Unique and fun decorations. The seafood pasta is pretty good - overwhelming amount of peas though. There's 2 shrimp, 2 scallops and about 2 lobster claws. While good, i don't recommend sharing or you might leave hungry. The rib entree was also yummy - cooked perfectly. They have fun drinks to try.

I've debated about whether it deserves three stars or earns 4, and I'm going with 4 based on a few points. We enjoyed the novelty of the entrance & restaurant theme, Alice in Wonderland. The food and service were, overall, quite good too.We were seated and served our drinks, and then we ordered two appetizers-- the fried mushrooms with buffalo cauliflower sauce and the duck wings. The mushrooms were gluten free and pretty good. They had a lot of breading on the outside, which isn't really my thing, but the sauce was great! I didn't personally try the duck wings. They weren't gluten free and they were, according to my husband, a bit on the sweet side, which isn't my fave. He reported, however, that they were very good in his opinion.For dinner, I ordered the filet with asparagus and a risotto cake. It was perfectly cooked to my desired temperature, and the sauce and risotto cake were excellent accompaniments. My daughter had the truffle mac n' cheese, which she loved. It was a huge portion! My husband had the chicken dinner. It was fine. Nothing to write home about and quite rich, but it hit the spot for him."}, {"review_id": "9G0hyNxXUUtXH2tom_VprQ", "user_id": "6x4zsQC5_IjGi4X5hQQhcA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "I'll start by saying the ONLY reason there were stars at all was because the food was good. The service however was AWFUL. We waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order and then moved to the bar where we waited another 10 minutes. We were two of the six people at the bar. Two tables walked in after us and had food before our order was taken. Just after our order was finally taken a regular walked in and got food working five minutes. The bartender was more interested in flirting with him and talking about an incident that happened the night before than waiting on anyone else. The bartender and another server (?) we're doing shots behind the bar. Two kitchen staff walked out to get liquor, twice. Maybe this was why service was slow?? The prep cook was filling his hand with candy then throwing it in his mouth in between preparing food. Yes we were sitting right in front of the window. There were 8-10 servers and it should've run like an well oiled machine but it was far from it. I was so looking forward to eating here. I bookmarked it weeks ago for a fun three day weekend and was so disappointed with the service and self absorbed wait staff. The food was the only reason I gave it stars. It's good but can't overcome being ignored and treated poorly."}, {"review_id": "GJ3Kzpd9Syv1BnAipe3rcw", "user_id": "ZxLwoAuBX-OJ8uMxTG4mcw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "I like the Rabbit Hole, it's solid. It showcases an interesting and agreeable menu with excellent drinks and martinis. I could have ordered 3 or 4 items, and any of the drinks, it all looked very appealing. I had Rabbit meatloaf, with smoked tomato Demi-glaze. Good 4/5. I had to turn down the pastry rabbit stew, the jalapeño fried chicken, and the bison burger, which I will order next time. Service was great, and the waitress was very personable , you could tell she liked working there, which is always a good sign. The prices were good for the quality of the ingredients and the homemade nature of the food. The ambiance and underground element are fun too, though it does get loud. Make a reservation, this is certainly a place that can get filled quickly and there's no real standing room/waiting area. I could see myself going back for a get-together with friends, or, a date night, and I recommend this place.

I had the buffalo short ribs with cherry and it was everything you want in a fine dining dish. Other hits were the truffle cauliflower Mac and cheese, as well as the fillet.

You enter through a small door in the middle of the sidewalk with a red neon sign which ominously reads \"The Rabbit Hole.\" The door leads down a flight of concrete stairs down to the basement establishment known as The Rabbit Hole. Sitting down this quiet bar and restaurant quickly offers up both quirky ambience and an interesting menu filled will unexpected pairings. I had the brussel sprouts with bacon sauteed in maple syrup. I was a bit skeptical and although they were a bit sweeter than I would have preferred I did enjoy them. I also had the mussels in a white sauce with small shavings of parmasean.

It's underground with an entrance almost like a subway station, which is pretty cool. The decor is Alice and wonderland themed but was sort of over the top for me. Kind of cheesy. Our meal had its highs and lows. The pork belly tacos were awesome with mango slaw. It could truly be big enough for a meal for one person. Then we had the chicken, burger, and the  mushroom risotto dish. The mushroom risotto was great, the chicken breast with mashed potatoes was good, and the burger was less than mediocre. It was totally over cooked and even with the jalapeño jam is had no flavor. The cocktail list was gimmicky and martini heavy. I opted for wine which was really good. While my meal wasn't great, I know the other people in my party mostly enjoyed theirs. It just isn't for me."}, {"review_id": "zMhdXCHNx4hLUeUptp8vyQ", "user_id": "Fd3GvZTer-2_EwMzL3ptAg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/24/2017", "text": "I had heard about this place from my local work colleagues and so was excited to try it out. We made a reservation (VERY highly recommended) and they could squeeze in our party of 6 on a Monday night which made me super happy. I loved the entrance - in fact a few of our party actually walked by it and then had to come back and down the rabbit hole steps. Also a note about the décor  - I loved the Alice in Wonderland theme and the murals on the walls are highly imaginative and the layout did remind me of a rabbit warren, so 5 stars for getting it perfectly right, without going into kitsch-land, for the theme.So, I had checked out the menu prior and was pretty sure was going to get the Bunny bites with berry mustard as my starter and then then Rabbit \"Hare\" Pie with Cheddar Leek Panade as my side. However after our waitress explained that the Butcher Block for 2 ($38) was a tasting menu of sorts and would include the buffalo ribs, the duck, the pig, the chicken, the hare, bacon jam and 3 different kinds of sausages, I was sold and convinced a co-worker to go halfsies with me. Gosh - that plate of food was massive and if you are on the Atkins or Paleo diet, probably perfect for you. I enjoyed this a lot and my fave pieces of meat were the ribs and the hare as well as the sausages. I wasn't a fan of the chicken and duck as much - the spices on those just didn't stand up as well to the other pieces on the plate. However with our best efforts, we couldn't finish off the food on that butcher block and honestly, I reckon 4 ppl could share that easily - I would even suggest getting this dish as a starter!!!  It's also very definitely massive value for money.And speaking of starters - I made the mistake of indeed ordering the Bunny Bites (a bit too tough) and the Colorado Wild Mushroom starter which bit into the tummy space left available for the Butcher Block too!We didn't have any space in our tums for dessert and waddled out 2 hours later with very full bellies and a doggy bag - very glad I got to eat here and check this place out while in Colorado Springs!Yelp 184/2017"}, {"review_id": "qYXmi6xVQs3un7Y9bfBVyQ", "user_id": "wF23osRylpYzSTA-qVKSng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I had the hamburger and it wasn't a typical one.
