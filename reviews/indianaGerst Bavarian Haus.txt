I've eaten often at the Nashville (TN) Gerst as well. Their in-house Gerst beer is good (by American standards), but the food at both locations not quite as good (by German standards). Non-German food they do reasonably well. girlfriend loves the huge salmon salad.

I have been trying to get my hands on one of these for years. It was delicious - and so was the Gerst Amber I had as well. I started out with the potato pancake, sided by apple sauce and sour cream. The crispy cake brought the right amount of heat. I opted for the catfish sided with white beans, corn bread, mashed potatoes, and - of course - sauerkraut. All absolutely perfect, even more so covered in hot sauce. The meal wouldn't be complete without an apple streusel with vanilla ice cream. Perfect beginning to end!"}, {"review_id": "oBUhsDNIyEKKcWRKu5GrEw", "user_id": "d5bqRsw4CGukrT_lLYtGDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "What can I say that hasn't been said already? This place is a unique German restaurant. I've tried a few different German restaurants in the Midwest, and I've never found another that is as good as this one, at least as far as the German menu goes.The inside looks like they grabbed every Bavarian souvenir they could find - which isn't a bad thing. I'm fairly low maintenance when it comes to service, but I found them to be very attentive and friendly.The food itself, I always get a sausage combination platter, because I can't decide on which one to get. The portions are generous, so I end up going home with leftovers every time. You can't go wrong with any of the potato sides, but I would highly recommend the German Potatoes. Yum yum!"}, {"review_id": "1jmfAe9hhfEsDdkrh3l2SQ", "user_id": "Oczs8WWm45yVWdn6M32h6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/13/2017", "text": "Last night I went to Gerst Haus for their restaurant week special.

Inconsistency! The worst thing a restaurant can do is to change the way they make a popular dish. We went to the Gerst on a Friday night wanting their wonderful catfish. In the past it has been our favorite. On the particular night someone was trying their version of the catfish breading and it was an epic fail!!! It had an odd texture and flavor which was a real turn off. It looked like there were several different spices or herbs in it.
