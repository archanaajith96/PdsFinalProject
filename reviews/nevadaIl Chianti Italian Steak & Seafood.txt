Chef Rudy has skill, passion, and a clear love of cooking.Chef Rudy greets and chats with you to make sure you get what you want. Today they were doing their brunch menu, but the chef whipped up an on the spot alternative for us, a pork belly burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was outstanding topped with pork belly, cheese and  a freshly fried egg. The sweet potato fries were fresh and perfectly seasoned. The service was friendly, and quick."}, {"review_id": "95BX063ggICqYEHhJ2OWcg", "user_id": "03iMNggjXP2tOkfih15ccA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Culinary explosion. I forgot how wonderful this place is. A terrific family restaurant with fantastic flare for favor and exceptional service. The lumpia egg rolls have fantastic flavor as do the adobo mushroom and dates albeit rich. I have had the cioppino which is fantastic especially if you spice it up. The chef is incredibly talented and can tailor every meal to your taste. The wine selection is fantastic. They have an incredibly fantastic pasta dish that is made in a cheese bowl drenched in fresh flavor. They have great specials throughout the week and on Mondays you can even book private parties to cook with the chef.  Make sure you put this place on your bookmark for any night out.  You will be back again and again."}, {"review_id": "WEI71tqVVQdi_h1r_Rmtkg", "user_id": "zFBcBstgo4gPMqwcYo9gvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Awesome Italian food all around!!

The chef is super friendly and came out to check on everyone. We started with the caprese and the lobster bisque. The caprese was done with fresh burrata cheese and perfectly ripened tomatoes. The bisque was tasty, especially when paired with the fresh breadsticks.My husband had the adobo nation, which is a braised pork belly and chicken dish. The flavors were beyond expectations. It's served with a risotto. He was really happy.I ordered the Linguini alla  Mediterranean. The seafood was perfectly cooked and tender. The flavors of the pasta and sauce were fantastic. This visit reminded me of my trip to Italy.

Dimmed lighting with Sinatra music playing in the background.....gives me that whole Chicago/New York vibe. We told our waiter this was our first time here and he gave us a quick run of the menu, specials of the day and some of their popular items. I ordered the beef and cheese tortellini and my boyfriend got the veal vesuvio. We both were highly pleased with our entrees. Food came out pippin hot and portions were plentiful. Enough for leftovers too. We will definitely be returning...there were other entrees I wanted to try...like the Chicken Parm or the Carbonara Della Nonna.FYI, restaurant is closed Mondays so plan accordingly. Smaller sized restaurant so you may have to make a reservation if you're planning to come with a big party."}, {"review_id": "4LBojWAo7nAqnzBRJX2clQ", "user_id": "DwIIgSGzmB43hFgvnowVZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "DELICIOUS! Chef Rudy, Rose, Roger, and their team are amazing! Such wonderful hospitality and the food is divine. I've been here 3 times and loved everything I've tried: the signature carbonara made in the peccorino cheese wheel, lobster bisque, fresh breadsticks, bruschetta, eggplant Siciliana, and the list goes on. My personal favorite is the chicken piccata.  The service here is extraordinary and Chef Rudy is so passionate about his food and his guests' experience in his restaurant.

You walk in a customer and leave as family. Had a celebration dinner last evening. Lamb chop and Pork Belly appetizers are sensational. Pasta Mediterranean, a second time winner. Veal parmesan the best ever. And the Cheese Bowl that finishes off the pasta is just incredible and my little grandbaby gets to be Chef. Portions are very substantial and there is a great ambiance. We've been back four times and this has become our favorite place. Ask for Rose as your server. She is just so attentive and fun. Chef Rudy is so personable and makes you feel right at home."}, {"review_id": "33nxAA1CI3eQgs2Uatxwlw", "user_id": "PMhXA72gh7GgqlSWPTQMmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/29/2017", "text": "One of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a while!First off, the ambiance is nice. It's a small restaurant and when I went last Saturday they had live music for dinner that really set the tone. The small restaurant also provides a very community feel to it. People interact with one another, it's lively and friendly.Service was great. Our waiter was great and gave us some great info regarding the specials and dishes. I'm 20 so I can't drink, I asked if they had anything like a Shirley temple, which they didn't, but what he basically recommended was a virgin sangria and it was great. I loved it. Basically it was sprite with sangria mix and fresh fruits. My parents ordered sangrias as well (1 red and 1 white) that were apparently very good as well.For appetizers, we tried both the calamari and the adobo mushrooms. Mushrooms were amazing, the sauce was amazing and had some dates in it that gave it a little sweetness. Calamari was good too, but the mushrooms were undoubtedly my favorite between the two. For dinner, my mom and I split the special: prime rib with green beans and scalloped potatoes for 36$. They split it for us in the back and it was so much food. They brought the plate and my mom thought that's how it normally came until they put down my plate. It was really yummy, prime rib was tender and cooked well, greenbeans had lots of garlic.My dad ordered the adobo nation which was super yummy as well with lots of chicken and porkbelly and my little sister had the fettuccini alfredo and a bowl of clam chowder.Chef Rudy also came by to talk to us, which was so nice. Apparently they do cheese wheel pasta on Wednesdays and Thursdays which I have to try sometime. Being from the Philippines, he and my parents were talking about where they're from and the influence in his food.Also, definitely get the dessert. We had the limoncello (lemon gelato on a fried wonton) and the lava cake. Both were amazing, the lava cake was the best I've ever had, rich and creamy. The limoncello was refreshing and just perfect.We'll definitely be back!PS: the bread is amazing too, kinda reminded me of pan de sal."}, {"review_id": "tqAxI8g7VMJ2XGjq9_t1xQ", "user_id": "svpKGag7nAo9wFtnbbzVBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Omg!
