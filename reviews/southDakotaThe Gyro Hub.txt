Popped onto Yelp to see their reviews. We ordered the humus appetizer & 2 the original gyro with Turkish rice. Yummy!!!! The appetizer was served quickly with very warm pita bread the humus was excellent. Our gyros came out warm and filled to the top. The meat was excellent and the white sauce was just as good. This was my first time ever eating Turkish rice, it was excellent presentation of it was beautiful. I will return this place!!! I'm pretty impressed."}, {"review_id": "I-a3tqS_zwTRfNpAaa5ksw", "user_id": "8YH20ntOaqVPmUL9_70bQQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "We had the salad w8th gyro and it was really good!

We had been on the road through Wyoming overnight and had to sleep in the car. We found a hotel and hit the streets looking for food. We love Mediterranean Food so we had to give this place a try. Decent size store front to restaurant. Seemed to be family owned. That or everyone really really liked each other. Food was great and authentic. I had the Iskandar Platter. Gyro meat with a homemade tomato sauce and rice. Meat was tender and I could have ate the sauce by itself. The others had falafel sandwiches. They looked more like platters since you couldn't close the sandwich because there was so much food.  They loved it. We also had grape leaves. Some if the best we have had. Try it out. You will not be disappointed. Great quality and authentic."}, {"review_id": "-KeM4W9N1Rxt-6Ur-8i4BA", "user_id": "l77EEmygr-9lvlg2869WXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "This restaurant caught my eye and I decided to try it.

Surprised to see Mediterranean food here and with 5 stars, no less! We went for it without hesitation. After 4 days in SD we needed a good salad and veggies. I'm so glad we did, our group had the gyro salad, a chicken gyro and a falafel salad. All were AMAZING! We live in CA in an area with plentiful Mediterranean chains and this one beats them all. If you live locally or are traveling through, do not hesitate, head toward the Gyro Hub!"}, {"review_id": "cUPP_kSzhobLQdOxIlSMDg", "user_id": "zQ67ZocL2Lzg-kzq6aJUeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "We love this place.

We ordered 2 gyro boxes and a kids meal the gyro boxes are the exact same thing as a kids meal for 3 dollars more! The food was cold (possibly food dudes but I've never had an issue with that before) all in all my first experience at the gyro hub was not a good one and I will not be back. Paulys pizza makes a incredible gyro compares to what I was served today... I will say the dolmathes were absolutley delicious tho."}, {"review_id": "Nid-lIr3V9s4u8wxfat5Jg", "user_id": "1eeWM0J51PTNolvhzt2xoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2017", "text": "Cozy little place. 5 stars because I was not disappointed.

Upon walking in we had to stand in line for a little (came about noon). It didn't take long for it to become our turn. I went for the original gyro and my husband had the same but in a combo that came with a gyro, a side (went with Turkish potatoes -yum!) and a drink. Was about $20 for both.
