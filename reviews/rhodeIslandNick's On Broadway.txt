I left beautiful 65 degree CA weather for 30's here in Providence. My wife and I came here for breakfast and it was delicious ! We ordered the followings:- Some salad with pumpkin seeds. The wife said it was delicious. I'll just have to take her word for it. -I ordered the traditional benedict but included a sausage patty. They let you add all sorts of protein between the delicious biscuit and poached egg. All you have to do is ask ! DELICIOUS! - Extra crispy bacon and home potatoes as a side. Both very tasty.- OJ, fresh and very tasty with some pulp in it. The meal ended up being about 50 bucks with tip. Not a bad start to our day. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a breakfast/ lunch spot."}, {"review_id": "_ydRTN8zxNDn1eAQPm12cQ", "user_id": "VAHMWLwFMCcWvn_bg1Mwyg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "What sets Nick's apart from the collection of restaurants on Federal Hill is their consistently exceptional service. Whether you sit at the bar or in the dining room, you will be tended to with the utmost care. The appetizers are a great start to your meal - sometimes, they are my meal entirely. The chicken liver patê is an experience on its own. The hot mustard mixes so well with the chicken spread and creates this delicious flavour that is somehow better than the sum of its parts. The drinks are delicious and reasonably priced, a perfect compliment to the delicious food. You also get a palette pleasing amuse-bouche, often a deliciously light soup along with a bite of bread topped with some well-tended-to veggies. For those who care, the food is locally sourced whenever it can be. Whether it's for dinner or just for drinks, find a reason to venture out to Nick's."}, {"review_id": "-eifgkEeaLhafBtdVq32TQ", "user_id": "ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "I really didnt want to review this place but yelp suggested I did, so here we go. I remember why i never come here honestly. The location is great and the restaurant is very NYC vibes. Too bad the food and service don't match up.We walked in and was greeted and sat by the bartender. We were greeted by a girl with glasses and longer curly hair. I asked for vegan options but she didn't mention a lot. I read on yelp they were accommodating it's why we chose here. After all the \"options\" all I ended up getting was a side of breakfast potatoes.....Those weren't even good at all. Skin was tough and potatoes were hard in the middle with no flavor. Seriously that's all I got and I couldn't even eat that. Hot sauce just made it worse. I won't even go into the other people at my tables food. This is just about my meal.The water glasses on the table are soooooo small the server should be attentive or leave a craf on the table. I was without water many times. Then my partners coffee was bone dry not refilled until he actually had to get up and ask for it. The server actually came to refill my water once and literally had the ordacity to put the coffee pot next to my partners cup and not even realize to fill it. We were so puzzled. My friend comes here a lot she grabbed the bartender who usually waits on her to help this server out. She also told me I could have had wayyyyyyyyyyy more to eat there my server just didn't tell me all the vegan options. At this point after waiting 30 minutes for horrible potatoes and finding out I could have eaten more, I just left. My partner and friend finished their sub par meal without me.When you have to get another server to help you because yours is taking all her attention and effort and putting it into the 8 top that sat down. Suddenly the 3 top doesn't mean anything anymore. I will not be back here anytime soon. I could write more but why even?"}, {"review_id": "jahissJvFXnw7MRLFHcZMg", "user_id": "oiaaMu6kud2VU3l8hGtyaQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "I loved this place.

The seasonal veggies and fish filet were unbelievable. We really didn't like the cassoulet because we thought it was lacking flavor and the beans were a little under cooked.

It did not disappoint. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful. Food was a little on the slow side coming out, but I didn't find it too slow at all. More like a relaxed pace. They brought us an amuse Bouche to start. It was a toasted brown bread with an herb butter and caramelized onions. Very good. Next We had the beetroot and white bean hummus. It came with pieces of pesto bread. We also got the fish cake. Both appetizers were done well and very good. I really liked the sauce on the fish cake. For entrees, I had the pork, and my cousin had the chicken. We both liked our selections. The portions were a good size. The polenta that accompanied my pork wasn't the best I've ever had, but was good, nonetheless. We were too full for dessert, but they brought us a little complimentary sweet treat. It was a little lemon sesame ball. I wasn't too crazy about it, but I do appreciate the fact that they even do this.

My wife and I have been here several times in the last year or so, and every time it's outstanding. Chef Derek is one of the best anywhere and his talent is evident in every dish. We like to sit at the counter facing the kitchen because it's interesting to watch his team work to put all that great food out. Last time there we started with some Narragansett oysters, which were fantastic. Before we even got them, we were given an amuse-bouche of whipped warm goat cheese with cucumber, on a toast. Even in that tiny bite you could appreciate the contrasts of texture, temperature, and flavors. I could have had a dozen of those!We also had the charcuterie plate, and without doubt, Nick's makes the best in the state. Every detail and preparation were carefully considered and flawless. Delicious and perfect.The service is great and they have some excellent bartenders too. Nick's get my highest recommendation. You can't get a better meal in Rhode Island (and in a lot of other places too)."}, {"review_id": "dXyscwxy9MOAQRgCLt6hHQ", "user_id": "Zhsvq7QgC4DbnRe0kjJrvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "My FAVORITE breakfast spot in Rhode Island (maybe ever?)! Every time I try a new breakfast spot, I compare it to Nick's. I've waited anywhere between 1 minute (Friday morning) to an hour (Sunday afternoon). The wait is completely worth it. I usually get the eggs Benedict or the French toast. The eggs Benedict are the best I've ever had. One thing I love is that they come on a biscuit. The French toast is thick and delicious. The home fries are always crispy and well-seasoned. The service is alright- not bad but could be better. Upon arrival, putting your name on the wait list could be a bit of a hassle (they really need a better system...). This place gets so busy that sometimes you can wait an eternity for your water to be refilled or for your check to arrive.

When it gets to around 11am on the weekends, it gets really tough to get seated quickly. You pretty much need a small party to get seated in under 30 minutes. Top brunch location in Providence. Watching them work in the open kitchen is the most amazing experience. Would only recommend sitting at the kitchen bar if you're with people you don't want to talk to... kidding, but in all seriousness it's distracting (in a good way) to see them working in the kitchen.Their eggs benedict is always a solid option. They're really flexible with the protein you want to add to the benedict. Pancakes are delicious. The beans and eggs are a good option for a nice hearty breakfast.

Nice touch.Our dinner had its high marks, and some not quite as much.   A start with the soup.  Smoothed asparagus, potato, and leek, served warm in a shallow bowl and garnished with a dollop of sour, sour cream and soft, fragrant olive oil.   The asparagus still grassy, rich with cream, and that right little tart, great dish.A filet of Scup followed.  My grandfather would have loved it, as long as we hid from him the price. Its not a treasured fish, quite the opposite in fact, but growing up it was abundant and easy to catch from our little boat.  I've never had it cooked so well. Heck I've never even seen it filleted without leaving a bone.  This was pretty close to perfect, the greens wilting in the hot fish broth, the crispy skin of the fish left intact.  The hot sauce garnish, which reminded me of a thinned romesco, could have used a lighter touch, a bit too strong for the fish IMO. But the whole thing ate very well, very enjoyable plate indeed.My wife's dish though, a Pesto Risotto with roasted chicken, was marred by a double dose of salt.  Too much salt to eat more than a few bites.  Shame it was, because it certainly looked nice.Desert I typically skip, but in this case we did partake, and were rewarded.  Sorbet of cranberry and lime, had a back note of fine liquor, tart, icy and cold.  Served with wedges of sweet, ultra ripe, chilled grapefruit, tart orange and mint, in a swirl of sweet cream, whipped and garnished with house made jello bites.  Colorful, playful, fun, and tasty, hit on every one."}, {"review_id": "wyzr8CB-9zsO1afXEyhrrg", "user_id": "1Hr7MY-MFw2SsoISHrBn-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Such a good surprise, especially given the high expectations I had on Nick's!

We got there at 10ish on a Saturday and were seated in about 10 minutes or so. The place is small but a cute little brunch place. I got a mimosa($9) to start, and boyfriend got a beer ($6). We ordered two traditional eggs benedicts ($9.50/each) and added ham to both of them ($5/each) as well as a side of chicken sage+maple sausage ($5.50), a side of bacon ($5.50) and a side of small home-fried potatoes ($3). total came out to be about $63, before tip.Our waitress was really nice, she checked up on us regularly, and she super friendly and attentive all together. I enjoyed the eggs benedict because they make it with a biscuit instead of the normal english muffin. It was different and I enjoyed it. In my opinion, everything was a little on the pricier side, especially for the portion. The traditional eggs benedict doesnt come with any meat, so its just the biscuit, poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. I expected the traditional eggs benedict would mean it would come with ham like most eggs benedict comes with. but that was additional $5, which again, I'm not sure was worth it. $5.50 for 4 strips of bacon, $5.50 for a small patty of chicken sage+maple sausage, the small homefries was in fact small. The food was good overall, but I dont think the sides are worth the price they have them at. I might consider coming back for the eggs benedict next time, but I think i'd wanna try something else, like maybe their omelettes or something.Overall, for our first time, the eggs benedict did live up to the hype and the service was great."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/nicks-on-broadway-providence?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
