When I ordered it I originally thought it was a giant cookie, though that is not the best way to describe it. Very light, not too sweet. Fruit-jam-type filling and powdered sugar. Generous sizing. We went in on a cold day near Christmas and only had to wait a minute or so before we were served. There is no seating, only a standing table if I remember correctly. Anyway. This place is great for a treat! That's what we went in for, and it exceeded my expectations."}, {"review_id": "lDkbuQJxFMcLhYm83ndSjA", "user_id": "wRtDGmMriHBQSfqW15szJQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "The decor is great, everything is laid out very cleanly so you can easily see their pastries, breads and desserts. I went back recently, and they removed their seating, which I liked but I understand that space can be quite tight when they're busy.I feel that their highlights are their pastries. Croissants are phenomenal, anything with butter and sugar is baked perfectly. Sweets are elegantly put together and actually very sweet. Perhaps you should take an insulin syringe with you just in case you get too large of a sugar spike... (just kidding) but seriously they're very good.What i didn't like was their baguette. I bought baguettes on separate occasions and both were overly salted and a bit dense. I was really hoping for something with a more open crumb. Perhaps both days I went were off days, but I usually go for their pastries and sweets, and occasionally to bask in the pretentiousness of a bakery that wants to be known as French."}, {"review_id": "VkF09jkUmdoZnogyqFNEog", "user_id": "2i0A5OoKyiwskqvnkGq7cA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "I stopped by on a snowy Saturday morning to pick up a goodie post gym (I workout to eat--life motto).

It was quite delicious. At $3.60, it was very reasonable. I'll definitely be back to try other goodies!Note, it's more of a grab and go. There is a standing table and it's fairly small.

The pastry crust, the tart creme, the crumble, the pear bake, each aspect was very well done. (I should know, I'm a master at watching baking shows.) The pastry cost about $3.50. The other pastries and bread looked amazing too. I regretted not buying more items when I was there. I wish they had any seating area and a real coffee bar to go with the pastries, it'd make it perfect! This is more of a take out place though now.

Here, of course.I enjoyed my interaction with the extremely proud and unabashedly French owner, who is from Lille. Lille have a fantastic football team, but he's not a football man, he's a little more refined than that. Sort of like Chevron gasoline as opposed to Citgo gasoline. He's into baking. And he bakes very well. Yes, I said \"bakes\".I give it a four because the prices are high and the products are *extremely* French which isn't always a good thing. For example, their sandwiches are as basic and bland and crusty as you could imagine. They don't really taste of very much at all. Which is *exactly* how baguette sandwiches in France are. So they're staying very true to the heritage, but since I'm not a big fan of that basic, bland sandwich (especially when the bread is this hard to bite into), I can't give it more than a 4. It does taste great, though, and is absolutely authentic. If you want to feel like you're in France, eating an actually French sandwich, this is the place to do it. It's a carbon copy. Or rather a bread copy."}, {"review_id": "hQLXZL_vuZXbr2BZ-7HBBw", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "What to get: any pastryService: 4/5Atmosphere: dessert, cafe, to goWait: 0 mins (Tuesday 4PM for 1)Parking: streetThe Experience: [August 2016]Afternoon snack time?

That being said, their selection probably wasn't as plentiful as it would be in the morning, but I still was able to go some macarons and the special of the day pastry (totally forgot the name of it).Parking can be a little strange and tight in the area (that's coming from an out-of-towner), but it can be found within a reasonable walking distance. I think I looped around a bit, but I found something eventually.I love pastries, so I'd recommend coming here earlier in the day (like the morning) to get the best selection.

I did get a raspberry macaroon which was more soft than crunchy and it was good although  I prefer crunchy. I ordered one of those large raspberry macaroons but I haven't tried it yet.

Minimal standing only high tables with just a few outdoor seats facing the street. The set up is definitely authentic, so right off the bat I have a good feeling about this. La Gourmandine offers traditional French pastries, baked goods, and a few savory items. Unfortunate there's only so much real estate my stomach can muster in one sitting, so I go with the quiche Lorraine, croissant au beurre(plain), and croissant almande(almond). Quiche Lorraine: I generally am not a fan of quiche(only because they would be 10 times better if served warm) but this is super tasty. Bacon, Caramelized onions, and eggs. What's not to love?!Croissant au beurre: to be honest, I've never had a croissant stateside that tastes anything like an actual Parisian version, but this is pretty good Croissant almande: I chose to save the best for last. I actually fell in love with almond croissants at a Belgian restaurant in NYC. That was the best I ever had. After trying dozen all over, I found another excellent version in Ottawa, Ontario. A dozen or so terrible versions later, I stumble on la Gourmandine! Not the traditional croissant, as it basically looks like it's been flattened, but amazing nonetheless. The filling is not too sweet, the powdered sugar is not overkill, and the almonds are plentiful. Yes, all that matters. Oh and the staff themselves? Exceptional! Not only patient and helpful, but quite gracious. I ended up leaving the \"to go\" portion of my order in a bag on one of the outside tables. Not only did they hold it for me until I returned, but they without me asking, decided to give me new pastries just in case someone tampered with it. Now that's how you win a customer! Nowhere really feels like Paris but Paris itself; but in terms of bakeries, this is pretty darn close"}, {"review_id": "hxNN1EErLamzzM-7EUSMIA", "user_id": "t2-wvybevFcdX7WuoIz8PA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/13/2017", "text": "This is a really great bakery and pastry shop.  I appreciate that they have some savory options as well, such as quiche (I'm considered myself not a fan of quiche before this visit but am now thinking I have just had some really dry, inferior quiches up to this point) and sandwiches.We had:- Coffee- Vegetarian quiche (yum)- Brioche Bostock (this was my favorite - If you like dense bread and almond cream/extract flavors, you will like this)- Chocolate croissant- One more thing that I can't remember the name of that was described as being similar to bread pudding.  It was good, but I thought it was more of a cross between a custard and bread pudding because it was really smooth (no bread bits) and creamy/eggy."}, {"review_id": "WmAZMSr4u2Nqd9x7bIBlUQ", "user_id": "GcdYgbaF75vj7RO6EZhPOQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2017", "text": "A local friend insisted that I *must* visit La Gourmandine Bakery & Pastry Shop before heading home to South Jersey.

The was a bit surprised by the size of Choux a la Creme, but oh it was so heavenly! It's a generous dessert size treat (you could probably split it via twisting it like an Oreo). The filling has a nice creamy mouth feel, with the slightest hint of vanilla. The choux dough was nice and crisp several hours after picking it up.
