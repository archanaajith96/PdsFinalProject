I highly recommend the curry, which is some of the best I've ever had. I have a high heat tolerance, and \"Very Spicy\" was actually spicy, imagine that! Spice levels are really customizable, which is awesome. I also recommend the Thai Iced Tea.Service: Friendly and efficient. They are certainly very busy, but it seems to work like clockwork. I have never eaten in, so can't speak to the wait staff.Price: Very reasonable for such good quality.Atmosphere: Tiny space, so not much seating at all. Nothing fancy. I'm not sure I will ever do anything other than take-out. It is also easy to miss, as it is on the back side of a brick building on Shrewsbury St.Their website claims it is \"The Best Thai Food in Charleston WV\". I can get on board with that."}, {"review_id": "QZEGESQwpxDVMb87tkC1_A", "user_id": "NFdhc4wDrZdl0viw94WBug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Wow, this place is awesome.  Great fresh thai meal.  The entry is at the back of the street (parking lot side) so be careful not to miss it.  Also there are only about 13 chairs inside."}, {"review_id": "YAKgpDd2L3LD6kpQiTnbNw", "user_id": "Xwt0Np2mjTUH9XAcCgsFaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Wow!

Cozy small restaurant with good takeout. Chiangmai is my absolute favorite. I get it medium spicy. The soup/sauce for the Chiangmai is something real special and it will most definitely fill you up. I've gotten their spring rolls but honestly it's a bit oily for my taste. The Pad Thai is also quite good with lots of vegetables and a great taste. Overall I would say it's the better Pad Thai of Charleston. I'm a regular here."}, {"review_id": "A3k_55xuzlFgp3iQWFKK-Q", "user_id": "UB8GPISx_J9L_x0-5eHo3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "My kids and I stopped in for a quick dinner on a Thursday around 7 pm for our first visit. It's a little hard to find because it is on the rear of the building. Just Google the address, find the building and walk around it until you see the black awning. It wasn't busy, so we ate in the small dining room. There are only four tables, so don't visit this place expecting to take a large party. But DO expect to get really tasty Thai food! My dd ordered the Massaman curry with chicken prepared Mild, my ds had Pad Thai with chicken prepared Very Spicy, and I had the Pad Tee Mao, prepared Medium. I tried all three. You just can't go wrong here. The flavors are complex and the ingredients are fresh and prepared to order.We also started with the fried wontons and the spring rolls. The fried wontons are just that - fried wontons. No filling. But crisp, tasty and served with a side of dipping sauce you will wish you could bathe in. I'm not a big fan of spring rolls or egg rolls, but my kids devoured them with the same sauce on the side.The prices are not unreasonable, and the owner's service is friendly and laid back. Go try this place. Soon. And Often.If you are feeding a crowd, just order takeout and make it a party!"}, {"review_id": "6nw8YC52Y2A4QBRS29n-iQ", "user_id": "UJDMLwXyvqzfOE01-5UMdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Food is exceptional!

Usually we get sandwiches from Johnnie's, but they were already closed, so it was the perfect time to try something new. Chow Thai is new to us and to Charleston, but they seem to have already worked out the kinks because our experience was smooth and easy. Also, it's tucked away between the off ramp for 64 and Shrewsbury, so you can miss it if you're not looking. We got take out, and everyone there was so nice and friendly. Frankly, everyone could have been surly, and we'd still go back because the food was so good! We split the pad Thai and spring rolls. Both were delicious, but the spring rolls and dipping sauce were amazing. When we go back, we'll try something else because the food others were eating also looked delicious. I imagine it will be very popular for lunch as it as almost full at 4:00 on a Saturday, so be warned. Basically, I have nothing but compliments for Chow Thai, and I am really looking forward to trying more menu items. Definitely check this place out for yourself if you've had even a passing thought about it."}, {"review_id": "EDz-1dYWiV3zU8F4aB7Y-g", "user_id": "Shcl0RwrqXrFrk29XQodbg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/5/2017", "text": "Authentic, delicious food at a reasonable price. You will not be disappointed when you give Chow Thai a shot. You may have to wait a few minutes to get your order in and get your food, because it was absolutely slammed when I visited, but it is well worth the wait. The wonderful blend of flavors will leave you wanting to try everything on their changing menu. The staff is friendly, courteous, and seem delighted with the opportunity to serve their food. Definitely a new star in the Charleston area."}, {"review_id": "59MJyliTZnJDQ-Kxp6il6g", "user_id": "_JCUEtSPgHUYKlCBpIn43A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "This is a cozy restaurant with very friendly staff and very tasty food.

Their spice level is 1-4, with 4 for people who have burnt out their taste buds, have a death wish, or lost a BET!!! I got the 3 and this is also for people who lost a BET or are trying to burn out their taste buds!!!! Therefore, the soup was tasty, but hard to tell beyond the heat how tasty. My main course(unfortunately can't remember name) again 3 star, was less burning because I was able to cut the HEAT with the rice and this was very good, but BUDS still were burning from soup. It is a small, very small place only 5 tables and somewhat hidden, but well worth the find. It appears to be a huge take out place. Service was excellent. I will definitely be back try again, but this time only number 2 SPICE. I want to taste the TASTY food better!!!"}, {"review_id": "KCRDpBHMxCCOrrBz40_Aaw", "user_id": "m3-4KVeXDkKMjYdFqA2Prg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "I've been waiting to try this place for months.
