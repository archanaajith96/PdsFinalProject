The place is small, you order at the counter. The line may be long but it goes quite quick. There's plenty of seating both inside and out. The service is friendly and the wait wasn't too long to receive our meals. The price is very reasonable for the quality of food you get."}, {"review_id": "yGZBQYl7vZoxD67U5x8P7g", "user_id": "jCzHkc8mI_nsFDjPsBrKgw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Place has friendly & up-beat, employees...

I like sup. But I feel they are not always consistent with the quality of their food. I believe consistency is key. If you make me a really delicious order one day and I come back again wanting to experience that and you fall way short, why would I come back again and risk it? I have orders the vegetables and pitas with artichoke dip before and got a beautiful array of fresh cut crisp veggies to dip as well as toasted pita bread. The other night when I order this to go, there was only a few veggies, and Untoasted pita bread. The cucumbers had that weird slime on them, like they were about to turn. And the dip itself barely filled the to go container halfway. Will I be back to sup? I think so. But will I bank on them ALWAYS providing a delicious fresh meal? I think not"}, {"review_id": "OA-FdQ_X0A3A2tN70U4iXQ", "user_id": "Q41Q24UCFsNAS8gZdFnVUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "When you're in a pinch and want something healthy and sort of quick. Sup is the BEST place to get a delicious semi-healthy lunch (depending on what you get). We were there this past Saturday. The young woman taking orders was so pleasant and kind. I enjoy that even though it is counter service they still bring water and silverware to the table. Portions are generous. I tried the hummus plate this time with a bowl of soup and it was the perfect amount of food. The hummus was home made and the veggies were fresh. The soup was a coconut milk based soup with mushrooms, but I forget the name of it. Everything was delicious! My husband enjoyed his steak salad and wants everyone to know that if you order it add on caramalized onions!"}, {"review_id": "MKjoAit712OYtPyqmteP0g", "user_id": "a2r5WiBx5hehodpEgIT3_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Crave SOUP???? Stop here,           Drive here,                           Dine here!!I lived here for two years and bought again this week while visiting. I've bought soup here at least 20+ times. Why???Affordable, delicious, clean restaurant, always friendly staff and this is like cooking soup at your home. I've had it all here. Try the Chicken Chipotle which is my favorite. They make their soups by scratch every day.

Every time I'm in Reno, the buddies I'm with always want to stop by here. I've only been to Reno twice and both times we had to stop here. I came in spring the first time and winter the second time. The first time I came it was yummy. I got the broccoli and cheese soup with a bread bowl. The soup is probably my favorite but it wasn't super hot and my bread bowl wasn't as crunchy. I did ask for it on the side the first time. It was still good. But my second experience was even better!The second time, the soup was WAY hotter. And since it was so cold the soup was amazing!! The bread bowl was nice n soft and crispy on the outside. It was WAY better! It might've been because we came about an hour and half before closing. But it was amazing! This time around I did get the tomato bisque but it was because everyone else got the broccoli and cheese soup which I've already tried. I was very pleased. Their meals also come with cookies. It was an oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip cookie. Soft in the center!!! So goooood."}, {"review_id": "o1MfKRNE302NX4z3lg7XNg", "user_id": "LkXNQQaIc5yrKu9Ap87RrA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I usually don't  update unless it's really important to update.  And after reading my old review.  I SERIOUSLY need to update this.  4 stars?   What was I thinking?!  This is one of the best and most consistent places in Midtown.

Then, I went to Süp and everything changed! Süp is a great addition to Midtown in Reno. Whenever my friends from out of state come into town, I always recommend Süp to them! My favorites include the Tuna Melt and the Roasted Veggie. Pair this with the Broccoli Cheddar soup and it's sooo good. The ingredients taste organic too. Other soups I've tried that I really like are the baked potato, tomato bisque and the clam chowder. Ambiance is very casual and perfect to come in during a cold or snowy day. Seating can get a little difficult when it's super busy though. Employees are super helpful and nice to you. Knocking off a star because I'm not the hugest fan of their cranberry salad. The dressing can be a hit or miss some times. There have been times where the salad dressing is really good and some times where it's too sour. Overall, great place in the heart of Midtown Reno."}, {"review_id": "IWH47KjQ6Cc-TnC1-Gwpag", "user_id": "xO3gLCBnX-LD6tEeCe3rig", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Consistent spot, parking is tricky and stresses me out.

Fantastic soup. Great and huge salad. Sandwiches look tasty. I had the house salad and a minestrone soup. Soup was perfect for a cold afternoon and had plenty of beans and thick tomatoes to compliment the great broth. The salad was huge and well worth the price. The sandwiches looked great from looking around, but that seems like a next time order. Only downside was that I ordered a baguette side for some dipping goodness and only received some baked bread. Tasty for soup globs, but no baguette. Still, a perfect lunch spot for sure. They even serve beer and wine and have happy hour for a nice beer and sandwich for a good price in the late afternoon. Sup is top notch in the Reno lunch scene."}, {"review_id": "Wsy4XjRSxsRUFvaICwLGSw", "user_id": "pn7rA-p4lT9aBl3adKAJFg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Damn that Reno Deli sandwich was a rip off.

I've visited several times over the past years and it never disappoints. Whenever I come I always get grilled cheese and tomato bisque. It is comfort food at it's best! It comes with a small salad and an even smaller cookie (it has decreased in size over the years), but I'm always comfortably full by the end of my meal. The atmosphere is cozy and it is a fun place to meet with friends whether it is outside on the patio on a nice, sunny day or inside when you need hot soup on a rainy day.
