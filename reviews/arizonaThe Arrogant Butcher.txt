It was lively when we got there, and a handful of people were waiting for a table. Since we had a reservation, we didn't have to wait but a few minutes while they got our table ready. The first thing I saw was a huge bar, equipped with a few TV screens for sports fans. They have lots of seating, goes all the way to the back. The booth seating at the back was larger than the typical four-people booth, it can comfortably seat up to six people.We started off with a couple of appetizer to share; Crispy Shrimp and Spinach & Artichoke Dip. The Crispy Shrimp was was very tasty and addicting. The portion was a bit small, especially considering the price tag. The dip was pretty good too, and the chips were tasty! For main, I went with Diver Scallops.  It was well made, high quality and I enjoyed every bite. At the end, we decided to share one dessert. Our server told us that their desserts are easy to share, and most of them (maybe all of them?) come in a bowl or some kind of container. We went with Warm Peanut Butter Cup. When it arrived, I was surprised by the way it looked. It was whipped dessert, more creamy than mousse. Very peanut butter-y. Our server, Logan was quite awesome. He was friendly and very informative, made us feel welcomed with a big smile. The service overall was very nice, all the staffs were polite and took good care of us. We had a nice dinner here, the price tag might be a bit high based on what you order, but the quality was also high. Definitely a great spot to get together with friends and family, or for a business dinner. Reservation is recommended with its popularity."}, {"review_id": "OhRjsChVyMfhNm22xBq33Q", "user_id": "TlBZwi8ayt-CbGGNQ6m2yQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This place is meh. The ambiance is really nice and I was able to get a seat at the bar right away! I was torn about even coming here, but seeing as I really like North which is another one of their restaurants I decided to give it a shot.I ordered the \"pink drink\" which is their version of a Cosmo and it's really good. For a starter I had the crispy shrimp, which was essentially just fried shrimp that comes with a spicy aioli. The sauce is good but the shrimp is nothing to write home about. For my main I asked the server which would be a better choice between the fish and chips or the crab stuffed chicken, he advised that the fish and chips was the better choice. Boy was I disappointed, the batter was so thick and greasy it was disgusting and the fries weren't anything to talk about  either.I will give this place a solid review for service and ambiance but the food I had was nothing special. Which is actually kind of sad because like I mentioned previously, I love north!"}, {"review_id": "PArHY5YUT1zV16fQQ8FFGA", "user_id": "_kalDgbF-7Dd2k12k-6G-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Very cool spot to grab some food. We came here on a weekday for lunch and there was a 20 minute wait. We are not from the area so maybe that is normal in these parts. For food we started out with oysters which where prefect. We ordered the chefs creation Butchers plate. It was over priced but still really good. Jambalaya was spot on. Spicy, very flavorfully and piping hot. I tried a salad with steak and that too was delicious. Our assigned server was not the greatest but whatever. It happens.Parking was a nightmare. So, do what I later found out you can do instead...park in the parking garage next to the restaurant and you will get a ticket from the restaurant to give the parking attendant so that you do not have to pay $10 for parking. You will need the money; this place ain't cheap. Overall, you should try this place out."}, {"review_id": "VDqZ5CdPYc3HTRK92UPBYg", "user_id": "1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I've been here a couple times, and while I like the general atmosphere, the food and service have been hit or miss. The Arrogant Butcher has a snazzy name and an equally snazzy downtown location, and there's always a bit of a wait to get seated. I've noticed that the dining room isn't ever completely full, so the wait must be due to a mismatch between space and servers. On my first visit, I came with a group of friends and we were seated outside. The service was superb, and our waiter was even nice enough to offer to roll down the plastic shade on the outside so the sunlight wouldn't be in our eyes. On my second visit, the service was lackluster and dismissive, to the point of being negligent. There was also a huge hair ball floating around the floor area I was sitting, which wasn't a pleasant sight during dining (I did think it was slightly funny that our waitress nonchalantly stepped over it multiple times).Fish and chips:The first time I had this dish, I was blown away by the light crispiness of the fish and the freshness of the fries. The portion was generous, and I was so excited to try it again the second time. When I did recommend that my friend order this the second time and we shared, I found the fish to be super oily and the coating to be too thick. The fries were also limp and borderline cold. Beef stew with cornbread:This stew was homey and comforting, especially when paired with the cornbread. The cornbread was lukewarm though, and that put a bit of a damper on the pairing. The seasoning is also on the spicy side, but the cornbread does a nice job of off-setting that. Cheese ravioli:A pretty solid dish, but the portion is on the small side for the price. The ravioli was made well, and the sauce was nicely seasoned. Turkey pastrami sandwich:I only had a bite of this on my first visit, but I thought the pastrami was pretty tasty. This is a hearty sandwich, and our server let us know that it was one of their most filling. Side salad can be substituted for the usual fries.I may be back to the Arrogant Butcher, but the mixed experiences I've had make me a little wary."}, {"review_id": "9tpw17PDGfzrcnwI_ID-LA", "user_id": "6AcigPwVG21cPebp_-Rv6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "When you have 24 hours in Phoenix, you jump the yelp recommendations straight to #1. And that's exactly what I did.My Uber driver told me that she gives tons of rides to this spot which made my excitement level jump to a 12 outta 10 (I think I found a winner)I was seated right away outside with a beautiful view of the mountains. I ordered the smoked salmon as my starter and the 805 on draft.It was great way to begin the meal. The brioche was drizzled with olive oil and the salmon could be easily spread across.For my main entree I ordered the scallops. It took me awhile to decide on them as I had never had scallops before and just heard the sad stories of them being the overcooked and rubbery.But I trusted their #1 ranking and went for it! They were spectacular, caramelized on the outside and nice and tender on the inside. They came with some roasted sweet potatoes and like a broccoli slaw, all with a reduction sauce. It was really nice. The only thing that was keeping me from giving this a five star review was, as my name states I'm always on a hunt for a deal. I thought the portion of my scallops were a tad on the small side for what I paid for them and knew I would have gone hungry had I not ordered the starter. But overall really a great place and would highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "CF7mteO9SQmZzqqXC6wuEA", "user_id": "_jqTa-3-fqmBxnkANJHtFw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "We came on a Saturday evening at around 6:30pm and had to wait about 20 minutes for a party of two.This place is really interesting because it seems like there are different portions of the restaurant that try to give off different atmospheres. There's a bar in the front that has modern decor. We ate in an area that seemed to represent a diner from the 1950s and had an open kitchen. There's an area in the bad that seemed to have a lot of bigger tables for larger parties and had a lot of portraits of baseball players. It seems like you can have a different experience depending on what you go there for.CHEESE RAVIOLI ($15) - This dish just didn't have the cheese flavors I was expecting in a cheese ravioli dish. There wasn't much of it and the ravioli itself didn't have much flavor. My girlfriend ordered the rainbow trout and she mentioned the same thing about the fish not having much flavor. The pine nuts gave it the crunchiness and the spinach gave the dish much needed saltiness. I was just not the biggest fan and the garlic bread was okay. 2.5/5SALTED CARAMEL PUDDING ($7) - We had heard a lot of Yelp reviews mention this so we hoped it would make up for the entrees. It was what its name says: salty and caramel-flavored. The whipped cream added a nice sweetness to it. It was probably the best thing we ate here. 4/5We really wanted to like the food here but we just couldn't get ourselves to like what we ordered."}, {"review_id": "MA2gX6rCBYlxnlu_OXHYng", "user_id": "oFU9ITr5I5uIzxbY-q2uqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "I was super impressed with Arrogant Butcher! I the fox restaurants but never had gotten around to coming to this one. I had an oyster craving so we decided to check it out.It's located in City Scape which is convenient and easy to find compared to other downtown locations. We were able to park in the garage which was a very short walk away. The only downside was that we forgot there was a game that night in downtown... well actually two games. So the parking prices were changed to $20 due to the events.I got a reservation through their website on OpenTable and our table was ready the moment we arrived. There appeared to be about 3-4 groups waiting. The ambiance inside was super charming and I loved looking at how the place was designed. Such fun furniture pieces and lighting. They had several Tv's showing the games but they were not obnoxious or distracting. It blended in nicely.Our server was personable. I got two oysters (I told you I had a little craving for them!) And a half pound of crab legs. I requested them to be steamed. I loved that you could order the oysters by the piece. I'm not sure if it's because I was craving them THAT bad or because they were THAT good but man oh man those were the best oysters I've ever had. I was in heaven. The crab came with cuts so you don't have to try to get the meat yourself. It was a win win for me.The Arrogant Butcher will definitely be included on my rotation of restaurants. Look to reserve a table online, and keep in mind if it's a game day if you want to avoid paying overpriced parking!"}, {"review_id": "gneNPAqF9vCcegtzWKBrDQ", "user_id": "9FyBOjMNADDIWtGbWZPMQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "The Arrogant Butcher is a gastropub restaurant in Downtown Phoenix.  It's within walking distance to the theater and sports arena.  Parking is available in the nearby parking structure.  It's $10 but you can get it validated.  We were in town for the weekend and needed to find a place to have dinner.  This spot caught my attention with the catchy name.  We came here on a busy Friday night at 8pm.  Everyone was out and about dining and grabbing a drink to unwind. Luckily it was a 30 minute wait since we chose outdoor seating.  It was nice because the weather was warm and breezy.  The hostess was nice.  Our server was very friendly and accommodating.  She checked on us throughout the meal.

For our entrees, we had the almond crusted rainbow trout.  It was ok served with sautéed green beans, potato purée and brown butter.  The grilled salmon is the better choice.  Smoky flavor and flaky texture.  I prefer this over the trout.  Also served with the same sides.

If this isn't the vibe they're going for then I can't tell you what the vibe is. Either way I'm still struggling to figure out what their menu and aesthetic is supposed to invoke. We arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday evening. The wait was roughly 20-25minutes. We were seated and the waitress arrived right away. The booth seats and the diner bar remind you of a 50s mom and pop place. The back with the poster filled walls remind you of a pub type feel. The bar in the front give a modern look to the place. The menu, despite its charcuterie apps and steak entrees, still has a homey feeling. I got the rainbow trout because I wanted something light. I wished I ignored my logic and got a burger or a steak (because that's what they're known for said the waitress) because as much as I wanted to like my entree it fell flat. My favorite part of the whole fish was the green beans, because it had flavor. I truly did want to like it because I was impressed with the ambience and decor but I can't lie. The trout had a delicious crunchy crust on it but no flavor. We saw many reviews mention the salted caramel pudding so we gave it a go. It is very creamy and sweet/salty. I'd suggest a cocktail that is a bit more strong or a coffee to pair with this dessert. All in all, this place caters to a demographic that isn't me. And that's not a bad thing but it's just not my thing. I'd say if this review peaked your interest then give it a go."}, {"review_id": "_GdDr_acdcX6xuoiyhml6w", "user_id": "Ed_E_fBL8VCSF60_Uv5bmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Busy on a Sunday at 4:45pm.

I'd say the beef stew I ordered tasted like one I can get for $5 in a super market. It didn't have a lot of meatI also ordered a blueberry cheesecake. Its texture is soft, like pudding, than cheesecake, $7. My price range for this would have been $5 or less because it wasn't big either.

This place is nestled near the chase field stadium in downtown so be prepared for parking structures. To start with the decor is very tasteful. I got seated with my party in one of their back rooms and the pictures on the wall were interesting. Waiters and hostesses were on their game despite how busy it was. Not once did I feel like their wait staff was rude or ignoring our party.For the food I am inclined to say that the appetizers did not disappoint. I ordered the pretzel bread with fondue and other people got the shrimp and nachos appetizers. None of them were below subpar each had its own unique flavor and look. The cheese especially with the pretzel bread had a soft taste and not overbearing. While the pretzel bread was unevenly salted on some and not other pieces the taste combined with the cheese was still fantastic.Onto the main entrees, I was able to get the turkey pastrami and the prime rib French dip sandwiches. Both were visually appetizing and both had completely different tastes. The only bad thing I can say is the slight spice of the horse radish was not expected. As I am not a fan of horse radish this did not take away the tasteful meats in both sandwiches.My number one place for salted caramel pudding now has a new champion. I can say hands down with the many places I have been able to get salted caramel pudding for dessert this is now my number one place. The sweet taste of caramel is neither overbearing nor is it underwhelming. The refreshing caramel taste with the whipped cream was a great balance."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-arrogant-butcher-phoenix?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
