Prior you could only get bun bo hue here, but now there's so many options, and really good ones!Had the chicken salad with porridge combo! It was really filling and flavorful! The pho ga is a huge portion! They give you the chicken on the side. The bun bo hue is also very flavorful, not too spicy but just enough!

Broth is flavorful as usual and noodles were decent. The meatloaf was fresh and so were the pigs feet. The beef was on the tougher side and the side of vegetables weren't too fresh.

The BBH isn't very spicy, so you will have to add extra spices yourself.Service has always been fast and efficient. The servers have always quick to take orders and serve food.

This was my first time trying Bún bò Hu and I was honestly very apprehensive of the soup. Mostly because of the oxtail and cube of congealed pig's blood, but I'm glad my friends convinced me to get out of my food comfort zone. The broth was absolutely amazing, it blew me away. Wasn't crazy about the oxtail, but the congealed pig's blood was pretty good! Very unique texture but I enjoyed it. All the other meats were great too! I definitely recommend trying this popular soup to anyone whose a little nervous. I was too, but I can't wait to try it again soon. Service was fast and as you would expect. Cash only. Maybe I'll even try the soup with the pizzle next time!"}, {"review_id": "9IwbuSmf3G3fb1VSjEVJWA", "user_id": "9tav_Og2maRV0ZRZs_fSKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "I had lunch at Bun Bo Hue An Nam a couple years ago with a friend and I see they've only just gotten more popular since then.I got their original spicy beef noodle.

I have a few other places I go to for bun bo hue but this, THIS IS THEEEEEE SPOT. Ok, now I am the pickiest person when it comes to bbh. I find that most places just give you a bowl of chili oil with no flavor. Don't expect that here, because their broth is soooo flavorful. I like to switch out the traditional bbh noodles for pho noodles, don't hate until you've tried it. I personally do not like the traditional noodles because it slips through my chopsticks and splashes all over my shirt. *note that I am not a professional chopstick user lol. Also, I've noticed that during the daytime, the bbh seems to be spicier than if you were to come during the evening. I don't know for sure but my bf is drenched in sweat when we eat here in the morning and has to drink like 3 cups of water. But on days where we eat it in the evening, he doesn't feel a burn or anything. Maybe the spiciness gets diluted out? hmmmmMMmMM. I don't know but spicy or not, the broth is still bomb"}, {"review_id": "cO1oewCUT2wn14ZHbQj_9A", "user_id": "XPkOo_1forYmF5DHhH4oGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "Probably the best bun bo hue in town.

With that said, it's the only thing that I get here. The broth although not as spicy as I'd like it to be, is rich, beefy, and aromatic. The noodles are cooked well and just the right thickness. If you've had bun bo hue enough, you'd know what I'm talking about. Fair amounts of meats, but skimpy on the pork blood. If you're wondering what the ox penis tastes like (#2, Ngau Pin \"Pizzle\"), it's pretty similar to a piece of tendon. Don't knock it til you try it. I promise you it's more than just a dick in soup. Definitely a hitter spot in the Bay. Come during slow hours to avoid parking issues and the long wait.

The bun bo hue broth does have a spicy kick to it, so be wary (but that's how it should be). They give you a decent amount of meat, and some cubes of pork blood which I love, but you only get 2 or so cubes with the small size. Honestly, not much to say besides solid, good flavor Vietnamese beef soup. Their BBH reminds me a lot of my dad's homemade bun bo hue (but when I go home to visit I don't have to pay $12-$14 a bowl lol). Overall, good flavors, but I just can't justify paying such a high premium on BBH!!"}, {"review_id": "4yofaIBxFnapmuwRZ84sqg", "user_id": "04phLe82L4L8QE3yW7uY5Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "So I started out by searching for a pho restaurant that has Banh Mi and concluded that they just don't exist (well, they don't exist and get high ratings). It then boiled down to pho or Banh Mi and I decided on both - first pho and then stopping by for Banh Mi to go. Although I have a go to Banh Mi restaurant, I'm still up in the air with pho. I searched in Little Saigon and found that Bun Bo Hue An Nam had stellar reviews. Off I went!We arrived and found it to be really clean and large. The parking was pretty easy and there was no wait as we went at around 2:30 on a Saturday. The menu is so simple and that is a good sign to me! Restaurants that specialize seem to always have better food :-)  We ordered one pho with briscuit and one #1 BBH. I opted for not going with the Ox penis as I prefer good Ox Tail instead. The order was taken quickly, water arrived promptly, and our food was out in about 5 minutes. Stellar so far!Now on to the taste. Quite frankly I really didn't think that the pho or the BBH tasted drastically different (better or worse) than my local pho restaurant. The taste was good, but nowhere near the taste that it would take for me to head back to this area just for pho. It's possible that my body does not contain the Vietnamese food genetic coding to allow me to differentiate between good and great pho. I accept this as my limitation, but it doesn't change my rating. The food, service, and cleanliness were all good. Not close to the 5 star ratings that so many place upon this food.Give it a shot and see if you find that stellar flavoring that everyone raves about. I just couldn't find it."}, {"review_id": "GtI5_3WZHe-OPYrRHWLp2g", "user_id": "oExPqFY1lIEHv0cT1OFl1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "Hands down my favorite bun bo hue spot!

It's kind of funny because I've been a regular here for years but only have ever had the BBH.I'm a real stickler for pho and to get a good review from me it's got to have a deep, flavorful broth, plenty of meat, and clean veggies.BBH An Nam got it all!!! Their soup is very beefy (haha) and hits all that I wanted. A small bowl comes with plenty of meat and plenty of noodles, such that I didn't even finish it, and I'm a big eater! The meat is on the leaner side but still retains all the flavor, which really appealed to me. The veggies are aways clean and plated nicely. A+ for food and presentation.Definitely a delicious bowl of pho! I think that this will soon be my go-tp pho joint, even if its a bit pricier than other bowls in the area and there's usually a wait of 5-15 minutes. Definitely worth it"}, {"review_id": "R4GUNy8Ba5M1gSW-c-LFmQ", "user_id": "fiD-hcqI2NncCdNVxSwsTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "You really can't just walk into any Vietnamese Restaurant and expect a good bowl of Bun Bo Hue. That is why I was so excited to finally have tried this place! Whenever I order BBH at other restaurants, I find myself pouring so many different condiments just to compensate for the lack of flavor in the broth. That was not the case here. They actually don't even have sauces out on the table for you because you do not need to add anything more! The broth was SUPER flavorful. Each order is accompanied with a personal arrangements of veggies and herbs to add into your soup. You really do not need anything else. I enjoyed every last bite of this meal!

Bun Bo Hue is a spicy beef noodle soup that has some lemongrass flavor and served with thick rice noodles. While this may sound simple, not many places do a good job at making this.I'm not sure what Bun Bo Hue An Nam does, but it's the best place for BBH in SJ. Even better than Hue off Silver Creek.  This place is so damn good that me and my coworkers will come here during hot summer days just to get our craving fulfilled. Don't come here expecting an extensive menu because they only serve BBH and Pho. Two things they are really good at making. Also.. if you're feeling a little adventurous ask them for some shrimp paste and chili.

Hubby and I were en route back home to Sacramento and we were hungover and hangry for a hot bowl of noodles! Bomb AF! Hands down for the best BBH I've had. Hubby and I both ordered a large bowl of their famous Bun Bo Hue with the added pizzle. Alright, so for you folks that don't know what pizzle is, it's penis meat of a bull. Yeah, ok we ordered the BBH with the pizzle NOT knowing it's dick meat until I googled it after clearing my bowl. In all honesty, it tastes like any other meat to me. Would I order it again? Most likely not! Anyway, aside from the pizzle, the BBH was very flavorful with a perfect hint of spiciness! It came with ample amount meat and onions along with a small personal bowl of cabbage and sprouts. Only complaint is that our bowl wasn't fulfilling considering we ordered a large. The size and amount of noodles is comparable to a small back home in Sac for us. Hubby was still hungry and we had to stop at another restaurant after to fill up on more food! Service here is very efficient! They seriously get people in and out quick. The workers are friendly, but they didn't come around often to check up on us. We didn't get any refills on our waters, but I guess that's kind of the typical service expected at these noodle houses?All in all, I'm glad I tried this place out.
