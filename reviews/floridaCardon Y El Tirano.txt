But once we walked in that doubt quickly went away.  The inside of the restaurant was eclectic and classy. The seats were all comfy and covered in soft leather. Our server was very attentive and helped us pick out a few items to try. The pork belly cachapas were crisp with a flavorful mix of fat and meat. Although it was extremely flavorful, I did opt to cut off some of the fat.  The Mushroom tacos were my favorite part of the meal. The pablano mushrooms and caramelized onions created a savory and sweet combination that hit the spot. The pork steamed buns that we tried were a new addition to the restaurant's menu.  The bun was soft but cooked enough that it wasn't sticky. The Roasted pork was juicy and had a little spice to it. The hint of spice from the pork paired great with the sweet taste of the pickled watermelon radish. I really enjoyed everything about the meal and I'm looking forward to the next time I can stop by."}, {"review_id": "ZzE1a9B54KS_hf8TpiAS8A", "user_id": "C_-Hu-1liU4kOTrBusP69A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "The most unexpected hidden gem. Cardon Y El Tirano is in a strip mall on Calle Ocho, but don't let that deter you, it is incredible! I have seen other Yelpers rave about this place, so I had to check it out! I came here for lunch to celebrate #YelpRestaurantWeek and my belated birthday, and it was everything I expected it to be and more. We were greeted by Eliseo, the friendly manager, and seated in a quaint table in the back. The ambiance in this place is adorable. It reminded me of a tapas restaurant in Madrid. The dark wood features, old movies playing silently on the tv, and jazz playing in the background just added to its charm. At night, it would be sooo romantic. (I am definitely marking this as a future date night spot). We decided to stick mostly to the \"tapeos\" portion of the menu, but there is also a \"comidas\" section with larger plates. We ordered some super refreshing homemade lemonade, and the following:Yuka Balls - these were by far my favorite bite of the meal. They had a crispy outside with creamy yucca and gouda cheese inside, and a guava dipping sauce... OMG I could eat these all day.Lechon Dumplings - crispy dumplings with tender lechon inside with a Vietnamese-style jus. I loved that the dumplings kept their crispness even when soaked in the sauce. Picadillo Cigar - lamb picadillo made with green apple and citrus (which had subtle flavors) in an egg-roll with a yogurt dipping sauce. Super unique and delicious.Tacos al Pastor - another one of my favorites! We ordered two because there is no way Diandra L and I were going to split a taco. The tortillas are homemade and oh so soft. Inside, the taco had carnitas, poblano pepper, caramelized onion, pico de gallo, and pineapple chutney. Probably one of the most delicious tacos I have had in Miami. Arepitas - we ordered the Beef Skirt and the shark (Cazon) Arepitas. The arepita was nice and crispy and overall, delicious. I preferred the beef, but the shark was very interesting. Eliseo explained that Cazon is very traditional in Venezuela.Mahi Chicharron - this was the one plate we ordered from the comidas section of the menu. The mahi had amazingly crispy skin, and sat atop of a bed of basmati rice with dots of habanero sauce and avocado mousse on the plate. Eliseo poured the delicious coriandre wine reduction sauce over the dish at the table. Plantain Bomboloni - we ended our fabulous meal with this amazing dessert. It was balls of sweet plantain fried and rolled in powdered sugar, served with a nutella sauce, pistachios, and avocado ice cream. So much creativity in one dish, and it was super yummy. Our entire meal was incredible, the service from Eliseo was very good, and the prices here are great for the amazing quality of the food (especially with #YelpRestaurantWeek). My last tip is that parking in this strip mall can be extremely difficult, but if it's full, you can always park on the street adjacent to the restaurant.Can't wait to come back and try more delicious food!"}, {"review_id": "oAa6TGXTFdvIj8MvzFsgFQ", "user_id": "qCRjHOnPZNVENukK76Kegg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I don't know what to make of this place.  It's not located in the best part of town, but the service was good.  It's a bit dark inside, but the food was delicious.  I think they must also have great training because my server has only been there for a week and was able to advise with great details the menu items.  He helped me make my selections and try a few of the small plates.  The food is very unique and tasty.  If you're around and in a he mood for tapas, try this pace."}, {"review_id": "gPTTMZpH0dUINcDrSdSDbw", "user_id": "aVkcE9ldp1DnlOAofybfkQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Had lunch here with my aunt yesterday and boy was it yummy! She had found out about this place from a food show on television, and had been dying to come. So of course she called me! Lol. Located right by Versailles and La Carreta, this restaurant is inside a shopping center, with their own parking lot. The location is semi-small, but elegantly decorated. Their menu mainly consists of tapas and small plates. There are some entrees as well. Naturally we went with the tapas, and ordered a bunch of stuff to try. Our order included the Lechon Dumplings, Crispy Oysters, Yuca Balls, Soft-shell crab buns, Bacalaitos, Pulpo y papa salad, and lamb chops. We also ordered their sangria, one red and one white. Our drinks arrived first, and we delicious and freshly made. We were also served shots of lentil soup to taste. Wow, it was delicious. I do enjoy a good lentil soup. Soon after came the lechon dumplings. They come with 4 pieces and literally looked like wontons, served in a savory broth. I loved them! They were tasty, and filled with plenty of meat, and the broth was great for dipping. Then came the Crispy Oysters, 6 pieces, served over a remoulade. The oysters were perfectly crisp, and the remoulade was nicely made and paired well with them. The Yuca balls were next to come, and were so delicious! They were filled with mushy Yuca and had guava on top. Unfortunately I couldn't really taste the goat cheese. But nonetheless they were yummy. They come served with 3 pieces. Bacalaitos arrived shortly after. We weren't much of a fan for this plate. The Bacalaitos were super salty, and the remoulade they were served over tasted like the same one from the Crispy Oysters. I wish they would have switched it up. I probably wouldn't order these again. I was really excited for the Soft Shell Crab Buns, because I love this kind of crab, but was not pleased with the plate either. While there was a nice portion of crab inside the bun (served with 2 buns), the sauce inside was so overpowering that I could barely taste the crab. Without that sauce, it would have been way better. The Lamb Chops and Pulpo salad came out simultaneously. I loved the lamb! It was tasty, packed with flavor, and perfectly cooked. The meat was so juicy, and the yogurt sauce underneath paired perfectly with it. The Pulpo Salad was our largest plate, and was perfect to have on the side, because it wad served cold, and it was refreshing. I would definitely order it again. Last but not least, we had to order dessert! Before arriving here, I had already checked this place out on Yelp, and had seen that they had a Nutella Carrot Cake on the menu, however, all of the most recent menu pictures, showed that they no longer offered it. I asked our waiter (possibly owner) if they still offered it, and he informed me that his mother makes it, so whenever she is in town, it is available! My lucky day!The Nutella Carrot Cake was heavenly. It was not overly sweet, and was nicely covered with nutella on top, as well as cream cheese frosting. The cake was so moist, it was literally falling apart at every bite, and it was also topped with pistachio nuts, which made for a nice crunch. My aunt ordered the Quesillo for dessert which she wasn't crazy about. It was very tiny, and she said the bacon it was topped with was rock hard. She wouldn't recommend it. Overall we had a great experience here, and I would definitely return. I highly recommend this place to my fellow yelpers, you will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "uFylcfOSMnY2WSBHRBJdvw", "user_id": "uzSICfBa4yIsMT-5sDwqnw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "So I came here today thinking it was Yelp week, but as I parked I realized I was 2 days early. Never mind in I go. Tucked in an unassuming strip mall adjacent to the Cuban restaurant de jure tourist trap is El Cadron.  First parking is tricky. The manager/waiter advised that there was parking in the back.  The restaurant's specialty is tapas.  We were given a small  bowl of lentil soup to be used as a consumme.  Nice. We ordered the shrimp taco, picadillo cigars, yuka balls, and lechón dumplings.  The shrimp taco was great. So I had another one.  The picadillo cigar is sliced in half served with some delicious yogurt. The yuka balls are a combination of goat and Gouda cheese; although it was more gouda than goat.  The lechón dumplings are an Asian inspired fusion. I read other reviews re the decor and I get it, but I understand the look and vibe they are going for and actually liked it.  They play silent movies in the background and pipe in jazz.  So not your typical Miami mass consumer restaurant; it's unique. If you can understand it, El Cadron will not disappoint.  If you don't then go down the block with the hordes."}, {"review_id": "sZqT3-2sclpKOF1VEDg01A", "user_id": "SQXsow-nuLYYQnTcsIedIA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Cardon y El Tirano has been on my radar for a while now, and when they signed on to participate in #YelpRestaurantWeek I knew I had to stop by to enjoy all.the.tapas!This restaurant is a gem tucked away in a tiny 8th street strip mall. That being said, parking is limited in the lot - but you can park around the block on the street.We were greeted by Eliseo who is the manager and he was oh so friendly! He even mentioned he was planning to stop by another restaurant participating in #YelpRestaurantWeek later that afternoon. Love to see businesses supporting other businesses - cheers to you, Eliseo!OK NOW moving on to the food! The menu is split up into Tapeos - or small plates, and also Comidas, larger plates. The price points are really reasonable for the tapeos so we went a little crazy on ordering. We got:- Picadillo Cigars: so yummy - imagine a picadillo egg roll with a creamy dipping sauce. YUM!- Lechon Dumplings - these were one of my faves. Juicy lechon nestled inside a crispy dumpling. - Yuka Balls - ok here is the winner for me. Fried yuca with gouda cheese and goat cheese paired with a guava sauce. These were the perfect combo of fried, sweet, and savory. I'm happy Tia P split the last one with me, because I was craving so many more once I took a bite!- Arepitas: we went with the shredded beef and the shark. The stand out to me was the shark, because as Eliseo explained it's very traditional in Venezuela and it was definitely interesting. The arepitas were fried to perfection.- Tacos al Pastor - soooo yummy! They come one to an order, so we got two because no one has time to share a taco. - Mahi Chicharon - this dish is from the comidas menu, and is a hefty portion. Crispy mahi mahi with a wine reduction sauce over basmati rice.Last but not least we ended with dessert. We ordered the plantain bombolini which was definitely one of the more interesting desserts I have tried! Sweet plantains and nutella paired with avocado ice cream. A must try!The whole meal was washed down with house made lemonade which was perfectly refreshing to balance all the fried yummies we shared.Cardon Y El Tirano is such a cute spot for date night, girls night ,or any time you just want to share some really great food with your friends. I recommend coming hungry and trying many of the tapeos. We ordered a lot, but there is still so many more things I want to try!Will definitely be back for more!"}, {"review_id": "v8nCUfcIgtjkH7EMbl3Wwg", "user_id": "xX0lsUzO8QnYVNsVcSN3yw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "The food here is AMAZING.

Everything comes out at different times, as tapas usually do. The food was so fresh It felt that they smashed the yuca right before frying it. The environment in this place is awesome.

I recently returned and vow to make this more of a regular destination. It's worth it! Located off of Calle Ocho quite close to Versailles, you'd definitely miss the signage if you didn't know it was there. There's a small parking lot where we were able to find a spot but it services all the businesses in the mini shopping plaza, so plan accordingly. I made a reservation the day of via Yelp Reservations (yes!) and they were kind to call and confirm that day. Our table was ready for us when we walked in!The menu is vast, taking inspiration from many cuisines including Cuban, Venezuelan, Colombian, Spanish, and so on. They encourage you to eat family style, ordering many plates and eating it as it's all prepared. That's basically my favorite way to eat! On my last visit, we repeated many of the \"Tapeo\" dishes I got the first time I was there including: - Picadillo Cigars: Braised lamb, green apple. black lime and yogurt dipping sauce. I would definitely order one of these just for myself next time! The presentation is awesome and the taste even better. - Yuka Balls: Goat cheese, gouda and guava. What more do you need? These are SO good. - Lechon Dumplings: These Asian-inspired dumplings come swimming in a pork au jus. I wish I could slurp it all up with a spoon. - Arepitas: We tried the morcilla arepitas which were delicious! The arepitas are perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you aren't a blood sausage fan, you can opt for other toppings like beef or chicken.The \"Comidas\" are a little bit larger. We tried the tostones picanha and it was excellent. The meat was cooked perfectly, I just wanted more of it! I definitely have my eye on the pork belly cachapas for next time... With a beer, wine, and cocktail menu to boot, Cardon y El Tirano is a perfect spot for all sorts of occasions (and group sizes).

Tucked away in a strip mall in a remote part of Calle Ocho, you would never in a million years imagine that this would be one of the best restaurants in Miami. The dining room is very small, seating no more than 40 people in tables of different shapes and sizes, surrounded by artsy chairs and armchairs.The menu covers a variety of dishes with eclectic references that are from no place in particular, but somehow could only coexist in Miami. Arepas, tacos, yuca fritters, fish and octopus, steak and everything else. All of it prepared with incredible flare, combining ingredients in unique combinations that are unexpected yet familiar, as if a hipster chef had stolen your abuela's recipe book. Like someone telling a friend from out of town what Miami is about, its inexorable Latin American pedigree, the kitsch and the cool coexisting in precarious yet perfect harmony. Order the smoked flan for dessert, with gamey pieces of chocolate covered bacon. Have a bottle of txacolí, a light and dry Basque wine best served cold. Make reservations, this place can get crazy busy. Ask for Nico, he was our server and is extremely knowledgeable.
