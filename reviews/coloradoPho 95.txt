This is the best Pho spot in the world. Now, I know this is a huge statement. But I'll stand by this statement until I'm proved wrong.My GF and I visited Vietnam in search of the best Pho. We learned that Pho changes in recipe from up North to South. In North Vietnam, the Pho was very simple and plane. The deeper South we traveled (Saigon) the more flavor and elaborate the Pho became. So, Pho95 is a southern Vietnamese style pho with an American punch of flavor. We asked our waiter at Pho95, why is the Pho so different here in flavor then what we could find in Vietnam. His answer was perfect.In Vietnam we have our diet. It is not influenced by different cultures. Here, the diets are influenced by other cultures. Spices and flavors have to be combined to cater to the culture here. Americans need stronger flavors because we can get food from every culture here. Taste buds are different here.Pho95 is my favorite pho joint."}, {"review_id": "TC7DezvH_lfW022sTSoUmA", "user_id": "ZKQeh2bLafGyGMTeZ2xoHw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Delicious and authentic pho I had till now for absolutely great pricing. The taste of the broth was so flavorful. So we had their spicy pho chay which has some veggies and chicken, it wasn't that spicy i had to add hot sauce over it. I felt the chicken had some weird taste not like the regular one. My husband has fish so that was more tasty and had deliciousness to it. On my next visit i might not take chicken but would try some other fillers to the pho. They serve large portions i was just not able to finish their medium size pho it was so much. Pricing is not a much a difference considering to the small medium or large.Coming to service, it was not that great or impressive. Our server just served us and went off and later came with the bill, didn't even asked us how was the food and how was the experience. The ambiance is nice and cozy. Pho 95 is a small restaurant which i dint expect after seeing so many stars and reviews. The tables are literally squeezed in and the area is so tight even to move. They have placed too many tables and the size of the table is also too small.I literally felt that the couple sitting next table are sitting with us. It was like i have come to a restaurant in NYC. They should improve on the set up, otherwise its a great restaurant. I would definitely  come back just for their yummy pho."}, {"review_id": "voW4fhQWBXjuTOVtxfaRlA", "user_id": "YrW_IAP8p5nMOTfnSFvpKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Llllllove love lovvvveeeethis place!

The special price is indicated under the wagyu option. I got a medium filet mignon pho for $11 while my friends got the wagyu beef! I cannot stress how you need to make sure the waiters get your order right. My friend got the large wagyu and my other friend got the medium wagyu. But they looked completely DIFFERENT. We asked the waiter which one did he give to my friend and he claimed they were the same number. So I said \"what number is it then?\" He immediately panicked because he clearly didn't know what number he just gave to us. So he asked the waiter that took our order and he wrote down exactly what we wanted. It was just the waiter who gave us our food was completely confused and gave us whatever. ****double check with them Going on to the pho... I'm pretty sure I got the wagyu during that mix up because mine looked exactly like my friend's large wagyu pho. The meat was pretty tender! Speaking of the meat, they give you LARGE PORTIONS of it. Holy cow. Every time I thought I was done eating the meat, there would be more. Pretty worth it for the price! I highly recommend this place, just double check on your order to prevent any confusion."}, {"review_id": "ZB12b2hoXjNBo7PP6IiBXQ", "user_id": "SrzGh7sORpac4-_Ekmu6ZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This place rivals pho restaurants in So Cal.

I was surprised to see this place HOPPING at 8:10pm on a Monday night! We were sat quickly, and there's a cute fishtank in the middle of the dining room. The servers were SO responsive! We got our menus, our orders and our food in before we could even blink! Plus the staff was very good about refilling water, napkins and all the sauces on the table. I mean wow, talk about luxury service. We ordered pho, a noodle dish, and the shrimp spring rolls. The spring rolls were huge and the peanut sauce served with it was fresh and delicious. Of course I mixed it with hot chili sauce AND sriracha. Because you know, I'm crazy and I love everything spicy. The pho itself was GENEROUS HEAPING PORTIONS OF MEAT. YAAAAAAAAS. The broth was piping hot and tasty, and the basil/jalapeño garnishes were also generous. Sure, you pay a couple extra bucks compared to the neighboring pho places but it's SO worth it.

I had found it on Yelp based on the number of reviews. As soon as my husband and I drove by it, we realized it was a tourist trap among a bunch (and I mean, A BUNCH) of other pho places right on the same street. I read a few more reviews and realized they are mostly from out-of-towners.  Now on to the pho, it was alright. I mean, it's pho, so it was enjoyable anyway, but it did taste more like a powdered broth mix than one that's been simmering all day. So yeah, next time, I'm gonna try one of the other places right next door to this place.  They gave us a ton of veggies on a plate to put in the soup. All the standards - bean sprouts, basil, lime, jalapeños, etc."}, {"review_id": "8eX_AcCxXtRSGBlDVltvUg", "user_id": "IZ_GqfYCxcCti7Ck_fi6BA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "A famous and popular pho in Denver, and I drove here to have lunch. Almost full on Saturday noon, and you could feel the relaxed and happy atmosphere. Lots of different pho to choose from, and three sizes, which were small, medium and large. I had a medium combination pho, which included tendon, brisket, well done beef and rear beef. And also served with fresh green sprouts, peppers and lime. All the beefs were not only yummy, but also in large quantity. And considering the price for the medium pho, this had to be the best pho I've ever had!

However, the service was lackluster...actually it was poor. We walked in and were ignored for at least 10 mins. There was a server or busser who almost ran us over on multiple occasions as he passed by. Then when we finally got seated, I had high hopes for our server, as he was seemingly pleasant. But ultimately he too ignored us. He took our orders and delivered our check. Someone else brought the food, gave us to-go boxes and took our payments. No one asked how our meal was or if we needed anything. All that said, the food was definitely worth going back again."}, {"review_id": "KrJDsODHuPTxdPCQncK_mQ", "user_id": "YVhzAJjCkIN5riHmyhN0mw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "The weather was raining, I was exhausted after a day of work and in need of some Pho!!! i went to my trusted Yelpers and they did not dissapoint!!! The best pho EVER!! the broth was amazing:) I also loved how they gave the meat and everything seperately, so the meat did not cook in the broth!! The broth was also scorching HOT!!! SO GOOD!! the ONLY thing I would change, is please give me an extra cup!! The cup was FULL of broth, I had to use those little hotel cups of water to pour broth in them, because when I put the fillings and meat in, it would overflow!! But, that really is minor (and not worth taking off a star for!)

We order #8 Pho rare steak with tendon and I order the combination vermicelli rice noodle bowl. Coming from San Jose CA and Westminster SoCal, it's pretty comparable. Sprouts, basil, and leaves fresh and snappy, broth is rich, noodles a nice \"al dente\" tendon is tender and melty, and steak is properly sliced thin to cook in the hot broth. The place is busy and semi noisy.  Looks a little understaffed, as Waiters run around trying to tend to every table. But things seem to get done and they have a system down. Culture shock for me to see more non Asians in this place than not, but maybe I'm a culture noob from west coast. :)Really glad this place exists for the Denver community, and such a comfort to taste something like Home out here."}, {"review_id": "sKiRnzzU8ooSU80ir1o0qQ", "user_id": "WQ96Yu_71GuBzzDhuharHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "This place served our food very quickly, and had plenty of seating inside. The veggie and tofu pho was super tasty, with a little spice in the background. It was probably the best veggie broth I've had at a pho place! They gave plenty of veggies, including basil and saw herb. My friend had a veggie rice noodle bowl (bun) and she really liked it. Prices were about $9-10 each.The only negative is that the rags they used to wipe the tables had a sour smell. I have a sensitive nose, though, so most people probably wouldn't notice that. I recommend they use Stinky Towel Cleaner from Amazon to take care of that issue. I'd probably deduct half a star for that.

Upon entering we were the only asians besides the owners. Not typically a good sign..but we decided to try it out anyways. Overall Not that great and I've experienced much better. I got the combo pho and wasn't a big fan of it. The broth didn't taste good. Tasted like chicken broth or something other than typical beef broth. Upon asking waiter about the broth, the waiter was rude and said it was for sure beef and they don't have chicken broth. My girlfriend tried it too and she thought it didn't taste like beef either. It was kind of disappointing after reading all the reviews. I wouldn't recommend this place to visitors especially if you want the typical combo pho.
