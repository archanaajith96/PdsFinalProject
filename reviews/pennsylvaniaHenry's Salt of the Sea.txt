That's right, this restaurant is one of my all time favorites and tops my list. I am drooling right now thinking of all the delicious food I've consumed from Henry's over the years. I usually come here for the seafood, but I've also ordered the chicken and steak and have never been disappointed. I normally go for the broiled seafood combo so that I get a little bit of everything. The combo includes a lobster tail, clams casino, stuffed shrimp and scallops. The brown butter served with the lobster tail is delicious! The french onion soup is also to-die-for. Did I mention my favorite part?! They have the greatest salad bar ever. It's old school, has different salads to choose from, bacon bits, egg, cheese... all the good stuff. The blue cheese dressing is out of control... best I ever had type of OOC. Henry's old school vibe makes for such a great experience. The staff make the experience. It's small inside so I'd definitely recommend making reservations. The service is pretty old school as well and while I admire that \"this place hasn't changed, including service.. it would be nice for the waitress to give separate checks. It's really not a hard thing to do, but they refuse to do it every time we go... so then I waste time getting my calculator out and figuring out what each person owes, this  annoys me. *end rant* Since I don't live in Pennsylvania any more, I get some serious FOMO when my sisters plan a sisters dinner at Henry's (sisters dinner? yeah that's a thing in my house). I've actually looked into booking a flight home JUST to meet them for dinner at Henry's.. not even to hang out with them (don't tell them that part though). I can't wait to visit my Henry's again next time I'm in town! Also, can you open up a restaurant in Tampa so I can eat there every day? K, Thx, Bye!"}, {"review_id": "I2exiOncZf5n4qQ7jQ1JRQ", "user_id": "UWvW-j45ZeSZHsMtV9ivDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Better make reservations, this place is too popular to just walk in. The food is excellent, especially the seafood. I had the lobster francaise and it was out of this world. This paired with a baked potato, a fabulous salad bar and a good wine was perfect.The place is old and somewhat dark, the clientele is mostly regulars who seem to know the waitresses and bar staff well. It is cozy and comfortable.

The table behind us was seated 15 minutes after us and they left muttering about the lack of service. Our waitress did her best to wait on at least 6 tables in this narrow hallway of a restaurant.There was a early bird special menu from which we picked and had the following opinions: The best first-- crab cake. This is made of fresh pullable pieces of crab with the right proportion of binding ingredients. It was served with a sauce (tartar or cocktail), but neither is needed.Fish du jour stuffed with crab meat. Fresh fish, fresh crab, and a little bit of breading. Would recommend.Scallops. A whole stick of butter is melted in this little bowl. Rubbery and buttery.All came with the self serve salad bar and a cup of (salty) broccoli cheese soup. All the sides we picked were mediocre. Potato (burnt) skins with sour cream, a single simple roasted red potato, and zucchini with cranberries (not a good combination).I think I'll return someday and not order from the \"specials.\""}, {"review_id": "FG2fUxtyREbfguxk75JqlQ", "user_id": "Plflg8uzQIIBcuVz3G4Q6Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "We came here on a Thursday evening after just having moved to the area. We were a bit skeptical when we saw the exterior but what followed was heaven! Our eyes were a bit bigger than our stomachs but we ordered the mussels, stuffed mushrooms, ahi tuna and French onion soup for appetizers. The portions are very generous so we could barely take a few bites our our fruit de mare pasta which we split. Our waitress was phenomenal and friendly and quickly packed up our goodies (which we devoured the next day). What a hidden gem!

We went there yesterday to celebrate my birthday, it was our first time there, my mother has been there lots of times before and said great things. I had the crab cakes and they were excellent, lump crab meat and perfect size. The salad bar was wonderful as it comes with all meals and also they had a butternut squash soup that was the best I've had yet! Now the guys ordered some escargot and they LOVED them as well as the dinner they chose. Try this place if you haven't, it's great . I could go back today that's how impressed I was.

Oysters on the half shell were succulent. Escargots are hands down the best I have ever eaten. There we tender and cooked to perfection. For an entree I had one of the specials. Walleye Rogue. Perfectly cooked filet of flaky white fish, with a tomato, scallion, lemon butter topped with succulent jumbo lump crabmeat. Always an above and beyond dining experience. I always sit at the bar to enjoy good conversation with other guests and Frank the bartender.

We've always heard great things about Henry's Salt of the Sea, but I'm not a Seafood lover so it stayed on our list for a few years but we didn't get there until tonight. My fiancé had the seafood fra diablo. He said it was perfectly seasoned and the portion was very large with a lot of fresh seafood in it. He loved it. I had chicken parmesan on top of eggplant.

We normally don't eat that late but that was the only time they had available (I called the day before).The first thing I noticed while walking through the front door is how small this establishment was. There were 13 tables I believe along with a bar-top. I could now see why it's almost impossible to get a table without a reservation. After our server greeted us and got our drinks we ordered appetizers. All of their appetizers sounded good but we decided to try their escargot, stuffed mushrooms, shrimp ravioli, and lobster mac. All fantastic! My two favorites were the stuffed mushrooms and lobster mac-n-cheese.Next, we all helped ourselves to the salad bar (included with every dinner entree). Everything seemed to be fresh and it had a decent selection. I made two trips!Finally, dinner! I ordered one of their seafood specials called Fruits de Mers. It had lobster, shrimp, scallops, and crabmeat in a garlic cream sauce, and it was served over linguini. It was phenomenal! Without a doubt, top 5 dishes I've ever had. Our waitress was very nice and brought out our food in a timely manner. We didn't wait long for our food, but it didn't come out super quick where we feel rushed either. The drinks were always kept full, and she made sure we liked everything that we ordered.We all had an awesome experience!

Walking into Henry's is somewhat like a time warp, it's an old school place that has been an Allentown staple forever and for good reason. Inside, the place is dark and rather small. There is no kitchen, rather the food is made right out in the open next to the bar. The menu is extensive and seafood based. It is chock full of classics that emphasize sauces and lots of crab! Again, you won't find any modern menu items here but the food is good! I started with a cup of snapper soup which was so good. For dinner I opted for the whitefish special with lump crabmeat, it came with a twice baked potato and vegetable medley, you also get unlimited salad bar. Salad bar was great and a big hit with our table as they have ring Bologna....yes I said it! And if you don't know what ring bologna is, well I feel sorry for you!Our server was exceptional, she was quick and knowledgable. The place was very busy on a Saturday night, and my understanding is you petty much always need a reservation here."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-salt-of-the-sea-allentown?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
