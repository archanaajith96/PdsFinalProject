Great outdoor patio to enjoy the Colorado sunshine and doggie friendly. Very large menu with a variety of French toasts, Benny's, pancakes and eggs and things entrees. The lattes are amazing and love the latte art! Fast, causal where you order at the counter then claim a table after you purchased. You get your own water and soft drinks. Very busy on a Sunday so expect a little wait time. We ordered the corned beef hash, breakfast burrito & biscuits and gravy. Everything was delicious and something I'd order again. Most of the entrees are under $10 and very large portions.

I am so glad we did!It's a small place, located in it's own small building. There are approximately 12 - 15 tables inside the restaurant. It's a tight fit, but so worth it. There are also several tables outside the restaurant as well, so you can enjoy our meal in the Colorado sunshine.The interior is of browns, blacks, white, and cream tones. The floor is a cement type floor, so easy to keep clean.  There is music playing in the background, and it's a bit noisy, but we still enjoyed our meal.The menu is up along the wall, so look up to your left, rather than above the cash register.  The drink menu is up along the wall to right.  The menu includes items for breakfast and lunch, with the description below each food item. When you walk in, the counter where your order is taken, is up just a bit. I bet you will have to wait in line, but it's worth the wait.  I ordered the American breakfast, which is my usual bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast. I enjoyed my breakfast, as did my husband. My husband had the huevos rancheros, and they were very good. Of course, I had to try his dish, and it was good as well. The coffee, the dark roast, was very good too.Once you order, you take the number given to you, place it on your table, and wait for your food to be brought to you. You won't have to wait that long. While there, plenty of people came in to enjoy the good food. We thought that they will eventually need more room, as the place was crowded, which is a good sign.Good prices, very good food, nice and comfortable inside, large parking lot that is shared with all of the businesses on the same lot, good service too. The French Press is a good place for breakfast or lunch.See you there! It's worth the drive from where ever you are.Enjoy!"}, {"review_id": "KMMvhfuKn2ezd6pP6UVtiQ", "user_id": "V_JBfN8Y6d6DkNsJVXVUtQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "The French Press is one of those neighborhood gems that you know have super long waits during the weekend brunch hours! We stumbled on to French Press because my hubby was craving coffee (we're from Seattle, so...) and we had just finished brunch down the street.  It's a small cafe with seating both inside and out.  I ordered the drink special - Hazlenut mocha latte - it was a perfect pick me up drink - not too sweet!  I also noted the chalkboard menu featuring breakfast and lunch items, so this was on my radar to return and try breakfast - and they were priced reasonably, most food items were under $10!We came back 2 days later (on a weekday) to try their breakfast items.  I already had my eye on the French Toast, and they still had the same Hazlenut mocha latte drink special!  So my French Toast came with honey butter and graham cracker syrup - seriously original and delicious!!!  Additionally the dish also includes eggs and breakfast meat!  My hubby order the seasonal special French Toast which was a pumpkin spice French Toast.  Needless to say we were very full when we left!  This is a definite must try for anyone visiting the Denver area!"}, {"review_id": "yiZZXTFY39OYRDXbRI68Dg", "user_id": "PWXoEGiShRXEU5YNotl44Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Tiny little place!

It's definitely not the nicest building and area but the food was super delicious and the prices were very affordable! It's on the corner of Illiff and Chambers with no nice views, the patio is backed to the road and it's pretty busy out there so that was the only lame part and it's in the same parking lot as Walmart but don't get scared off, the food was really amazing. I loved the fact that their french toast automatically comes with 2 eggs and a choice of meat. You get the sweet and savory at the same time if you can't decide if you want a sweet or salty breakfast. We will be back for sure!

Every time I come into town I make a visit to French Press. The French Press has a great American style breakfast and lunch menu. Everything is reasonably priced and many things are $10 and under. I am a fan of many things on the menu. The Lox Burger is doing very well and is a light meal with a health kick. I also love the French toast which comes with eggs, and a choice of bacon, sausage or ham. Another great choice is the breakfast burrito which is LOADED. The breakfast burrito is HUGE! You can definitely split it! The cafe is small and on the weekends it is normally packed inside and sometimes the outside patio is packed as well!

While I am not usually one to make a review about service this was terrible. They are an order at the front place and after ordering they put the food in line. After waited for 30+ mins to get some eggs, bacon and toast, I went in to ask if our order was even still coming. They had apparently marked off the order as if we had received it already and then did not seem to care that the food had not come.

This place had been on my radar forever and I was able to convince my family to try it out with me. The seating system is interesting in that you don't sit until you've placed your order by standing in line at the counter--it seemed tricky with a large group and we thought we'd have to sit apart from each other, but we got lucky and snagged 2 tables outside where we could dine as a group.  I'm most impressed by the vastness of the menu--everyone can find something they like (taste wise, not in terms of being friendly to all diets) from breakfast to salmon to sammies. Was a little disappointed with the green chile biscuit plate...I didn't realize there would be SO much cheese involved. My step-dad was living a much better life than I was and ordered the french toast plate--looked like a delish piece of french bread. If I break from no meat/dairy, that french toast is what I'm choosing. And yes, their coffee lives up to its name. Order the French press.

The cashier was incredibly nice, he did his job. But the food really was predictable after dining for maybe the 4th time at a French Press. I must've felt like the magic was lost after that, and that usually never happens but it did. There was a baby hair in my dish, my friend and I debated where it must've come from, but nonetheless I brushed it aside and just went on and finished most of my dish. Still can't stop wondering if it was mine or who knows what. Mostly killed my appetite after seeing it. They discontinued a favorite breakfast platter of mine, presumably, I went with the French Toast with both bacon and sausage. The sausages were weirdly shaped, tasted different, possibly something I wasn't used to. The outside was very nice, felt annoyed about a cop who pulled over an old lady in the middle of the entrance to The French Press and felt annoyed by the amount of attention it brought from the patrons. Maybe this location didn't fully amaze me, but the food should be more desirable than settling for the Village Inn that's nearby."}, {"review_id": "O-YIxWlVAP2xijiSiIP26g", "user_id": "0fmYjn804ex7Yy5hkI6Drw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2017", "text": "This is my favorite Aurora brunch spot!
