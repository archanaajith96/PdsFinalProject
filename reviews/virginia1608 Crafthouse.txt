A group of coworkers and I stumbled upon this spot when we were in town for a night and needed a place for dinner. I saw that this place had great reviews and it did not disappoint. Located in a strip mall with an unassuming front, the restaurant reminded me a but if a hole in a wall place that only locals frequent. The atmosphere was great and the service was very friendly and quick as well.They have a few beers on tap and we decided to try a few of the local options but if those options don't suit your taste, they have a ton of cans and bottles as well. My table started out with the poutine and the Big A$$ pretzel. The poutine was absolutely amazing and the pretzel was in fact huge (literally served in a pizza box and sized the same). Both appetizers were delicious and we couldn't wait for the main course. I got the pork burger which was served with prom rinds as well. The portions were huge and I was barely able to finished everything but everything tasted so good that I had to. Everyone else in my group loved their entrees as well with one even claiming it was the best panco chicken they had ever had.All in all this place was a great find and I recommend anyone in the area should try it!"}, {"review_id": "d0ZiJ4RZ2UMl9dY3aGnjPw", "user_id": "iyRkv81UKj35_3P8fEoseA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "This place was great. Not very busy the day i went which is a plus for me. There's a lot of great beer to choose from. I got a couple different locals that they had on tap.Food was awesome. We had the biscuits n gravy and \"chiquidillas?\" The biscuits were amazing! Super tasty, hot, and moist. A+ on those. The entire menu wasn't what i expected from a \"Pub\" Inside was a little dark, but i liked it. It had a really nice ambiance about it. I'd definitely go back for a pint or three."}, {"review_id": "_0Vs5aBNG_l-txt1W98njQ", "user_id": "MOP9Ko60yNxXgk12CZRNrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "This little gem is tucked away in a shopping center strip. Seating inside and out. The dining room is small, and though not a lot of ambience the food is solid and the service is always outstanding even if they are busy. Great beer selection including lots of local choices. Food portions are very generous. I've had some delicious things here including roasted marrow bones, eggs benedict on fried green tomatoes and this carrot-bar dessert which was to die for. My meat eating husband even enjoyed their meatless philly \"cheesesteak.\""}, {"review_id": "J4mbrTLqS8F74t8uhcEMGA", "user_id": "0J63buZkSN6KpDPOwY9Bog", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "Having heard mixed reviews, had to give this place a try. Brought my staff for an end of the year dinner. Inside was not what I expected. Seating was a little colder than I envisioned. Compared to the food quality and thought, it looked a little dinky. But, the beer selection and food made up for it.Started with the big ass pretzel and poutine to share as apps. Pretzel was so tasty with 2 dipping sauces (I liked the white one best, but the group was split). Poutine was good - not as gravy-ish as I've had in the past, but good.My burger was on point! Had the lamb burger - medium - with oyster mushrooms and a pea shoot salad. The balance of flavors was spot on, the cook on the meat was perfect, and the basted bun topped it off perfectly.  Was served with a side salad with the most amazing basil vinaigrette dressing (we started dipping fries in it it was so fresh). Entree was superb. And I tasted the tuna special from someone at the table (served rare and it was perfect).Dessert left a little to be desired. We got a crumble and bread pudding. While good, not as light as either should have been.. a little dense. I would try dessert here again, but would go for something else.Great beer selection. Friendly and knowledgeable service. Will certainly return!"}, {"review_id": "KjleDjVWxOq69N1QEScs6w", "user_id": "Za9EI0hFTorWVxh67Vpwig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "So I don't stay in Virginia Beach often. So I was there for several days and needed to find a good place to eat. I chose 1608 Crafthouse based on the Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed. The bartender was very friendly an had excellent knowledge of beer and guided me to an excellent brew. The draft is limited to six or so taps but they have a good variety of canned and bottled craft beers. The food was very, very good. I settled on the pork burger which was andouille sausage and pork belly with homemade pork rinds. It was fantastic!I went away very satisfied and recommend this place wholeheartedly."}, {"review_id": "KLM1y8ske9UyzegGQVt_GQ", "user_id": "TJBKMFNlFiP658ceBbIsFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "Great little local place.

From the charcuterie plate to the burger to the steak to the dessert. WTF...it is just not fair for one establishment to be able to serve up so much good food the right way.  How is someone ever supposed to decide what to eat?Luckily, I have a boyfriend who can eat a lot so I get to try a little bit of everything. Whether you live locally or you are visiting, this place is legit and you should drop in. Their beer selection is on point, food is made with some real love and the service is the icing on the cake.  Well done, 1608.  Definitely one of my favorite places in the country.

In addition, their fresh squeezed cherry limeade was pretty good. My favorite part of the meal was the cast iron cookie skillet topped with vanilla bean crème brûlée gelato. It was a real treat.  Macadamia nut and pretzel mad for an interesting flavor cookie, but it was tasty nonetheless. Service was good, our waitress was nice. There was a little bit of a wait for the food, but the food made it well worth it."}, {"review_id": "LwTb1cC17zHFylA7d8WiTw", "user_id": "dlityiPK852OWzJ-_BJ0aA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "We did takeout, it was quick and tasty.

We got down to Norfolk the night before the wedding and decided to go get some food and drinks nearby. We used Yelp to find 1608 Crafthouse.We got there and opted to sit outside on a warm night. Tony was our server and was very accommodating and gave us the rundown on the menu. 80-90% of their menu is locally sourced which I loved. I started with an IPA from the Virginia Brewing Company, and it was awesome! It was a 7-8% beer but it was so light.We started with the Big A$$ pretzel (literally what it's named but maybe different symbols for the letters) and it was HUGE. It had a yummy seasoning on top which reminded me of the seasoning on an everything bagel. My friend and I decided to get the lamb feta mushroom burger and the bacon cheeseburger and split them. Their bacon cheeseburger won the best cheeseburger in the state according to a delish article. Both were amazing. I preferred the lamb burger, but my friend preferred the bacon cheeseburger.Everything was great. My friend and I left raving about this place. This restaurant is a prime example of how service can make or break a place. The food stood alone by itself, but our server Tony made us feel so welcome. He gave recommendations on nightlife, food, and even gave us information on a free Norfolk shuttle. He made our whole experience (including the food) awesome!!"}, {"review_id": "MVL3vZuvZ66GLIMDu0A6MA", "user_id": "5Nv8CoqK_95u0rCbxA9LKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/10/2017", "text": "Love it here! It's located on Pleasure House road. They have an outside patio where you can eat. What makes it a plus is that you can bring your pet! It's a quiet area so eating outside was very pleasant. While we were waiting for our food we ordered the lofty Mary flight. The flights to me were very flavorful and different than most bloody Mary's I've tried. My personal favorite was the triple B with bacon. We also ordered a jalapeño one which was very spicy to me. I ordered the poutine. On the menu it's under \"small plates\" but I think it was a lot! I couldn't even finish it. The poutine was amazing!!! It's fries covered with oxtail chili, sprouts, and a fried egg! It was perfect and flavorful. The fries were crispy and wasn't soggy at all. The egg gave it a perfect touch. Great place to have lunch!

Without skipping a beat, he recommended that I check out 1608 Crafthouse. I was trying to come up with a location to go to with my parents for a nice family dinner and 1608 delivered in a big way. Never in a million years would have expected 1608 to be as good as it was.From top to bottom, our experience was world class. Our server was incredibly friendly and very knowledgable when it came to their beer offerings and menu. Hell, he was wearing a Redskin hat, so I should have known that he would be an awesome guy HTTR. We all decided to go with the pan roasted ribeye served with bone marrow (a first for us all). The steak came with fries, but for a couple extra bucks, we upgraded the fries to poutine. The steak was cooked perfectly and the bone marrow tasted just like the server described it, \"God's butter.\" The poutine fries had cheese curds, oxtail chili, and a fried egg in them. I cannot put into words how good those fries were. We also tried a couple local beers with the favorite being Man-o-War from Reaver Beach Brewing. Always nice to see a local spot carrying locally crafted beer. Thank you to my coworker for the great recommendation and thank you to 1608 for being amazing.
