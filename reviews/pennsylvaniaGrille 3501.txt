I don't typically drink whiskey but usually taste his drinks, and I would agree with him.  Desserts were good too. I got the gingersnap creme brulee, very good.  The chocolate torte was good \"not spectacular\", \"not on par with the rest of the meal\" and I agree.Our server was friendly and efficient, could have been a little more personable and interactive.  I don't usually give 5 stars but the food was definitely the star here. We would go back to try different menu items."}, {"review_id": "d2johZSWZTyI0u8dKWwDyw", "user_id": "JNqcv2-EGHwWUKtVw-31QA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "So this place is definitely great and I don't want to turn people off just by my review. I'm only going based off of the type of person I am and what I personally enjoy in a bar/restaurant so my goal is to help like-minded people such as myself!This is a very, veryyyyy swanky upscale place, in my opinion. It's beautiful inside, a little cramped in the front entrance near the dining area but it's only an issue on busier nights. I've gone on a few dates here and you definitely want to reserve this for nights when you can allow yourself to SPLURGE as it is not for those of us on a budget.That being said, the waitstaff and bartenders are all very polite and professional. The food is exceptional with very beautiful plating. I'm actually upset I've never taken a photo of my food while I was there!Overall, I am personally not a huge fan as I normally enjoy more relaxed places with a light domestic draft and some bar food. So visiting places like this is out of my comfort zone (and my price range!). If the environment were a little more welcoming to everyday average joes, I would be interested in making another visit."}, {"review_id": "j2ciBt_EIAb37zrsWPCAyA", "user_id": "yXnEnkRdQLEb6iPxoS1ZTw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "I came here for galentine's day dinner with my girlfriends. We initially had reservations in the loft area by the bar. When we got to the check in area, we overheard the hostess say to another group \"I was able to switch you into this area by swapping your table with another group\". Come to find out, that \"other group\" was us. So we ended up having to sit in the main dining area, which my friends did not mind, although I was a bit annoyed the hostess had done that without asking us first. The food is spectacular- 5 stars all the way. I started off with Caesar salad and it was delicious. For my entree, I went with their special of the night, which was a niragi fish with a coconut based sauce and rice with bacon and edamame. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce wasn't too heavy on the coconut, which paired nicely with the fish. My only complaint is that the portions were quite small for $29. My friends were also very satisfied with their meals. The dessert was the best part of the meal- we ordered the chocolate flourless torte with vanilla ice cream and it was phenomenal. I would have bathed in that if I could. Service was provided by Gina, who was a bit slow at times, but she was very accommodating when we asked for separate checks."}, {"review_id": "uYljSjOsdYr1jqkeAj7ncw", "user_id": "8CSd-C5PgFTVv2SZtrujPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "I've been dying to try this place for quite some time so this year for my birthday I decided to go.

It was my favorite part of my meal. It's made with brown butter, applewood bacon, sage, and crispy kale.I haven't had a great steak in awhile so for my main entree I ordered the Filet mignon. It's accompanied with mashed potatoes and asparagus. So good! The steak was cooked to my liking and the portion size was perfect.Service was good from start to finish.

The bread you start with is superb and goes great with the light olive oil dip. Short ribs were tender, falling apart from the fork and the pomegranate jus had that hint of sweetness and sourness from the fruit that tasted delightful. Spinach, portabella and crispy potato cake added different kinds of texture to the dish and soaked up the delicious jus really well. Amazing food!Service - 4/5. Service was professional and attentive.Value - 5/5. Their lunch menu is extensive and has many of the same items they offer for dinner. You have choices in fish, shellfish, steak, braised meat, burgers, sandwiches and the appetizers with the highest entree price being $15. Being able to enjoy what the restaurant has to offer for a fraction of the price, this is my ideal lunch menu!

I went here for my birthday and I ordered the halibut special with curried carrots and roasted brussel sprouts with caramelised onions. The halibut was overcooked and underseasoned. The brussel sprouts and onions were not roasted pan or oven and were almost raw. They were in-edible. It was so hard it was incredibly difficult to chew. I mentioned this to the waitress she offered to get me a new side I thought that was generous since there were only a few on the plate and between my husband and I each trying one were half gone. She brings out a bowl of steamed brussel sprouts with onions. Have you ever had steamed onions with brussel sprouts? No seasoning. It was mushy and slimy and utterly distasteful. I sent them back.  The fish came with a basil infused olive oil. Infused it was not, it was cheap olive oil with some basil smashed up in it.  I was offered a free dessert which I did not want because my husband had cake waiting at home. They did not offer to take anything off the check and charged us an appalling $34 for that dish. My husband ordered the salmon and it was a poor quality cut and poorly cooked, very greasy. His sides were ok. The bread was pretty good but served with the cheap olive oil with pepper thrown in it. So confusing. I will NEVER return here again."}, {"review_id": "Q5zBNmfkXVrbmt4HBK7PHw", "user_id": "ijd0R0Co7UCJnFfuEeFCog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Favorite place for special occasions!

From the appetizers and entrees to the attentive service, I was impressed with every detail. The place was packed on a Friday night at 7:30, so we weren't able to be seated in the new Lodge section--next time! However we were seated right away in the cozy dining area where our server greeted us shortly after. Throughout the meal, he was very attentive, friendly, and professional.This place has an extensive wine list, mostly for a higher budget, but you'll find some reasonably priced pours. Ultimately it's probably smarter to share a bottle anyway :)I was also impressed with the beer menu, and there are plenty of cocktails to choose from as well. I went with a Washington State Cabernet and was very pleased.We tried the following appetizers: crab cake, wild boar agnolotti, calamari, lamb tenderloin (bite-sized, literally), and chicken dumplings (would not order again). The stand outs were the crab cake and the wild boar, in particular. I had never had boar, so tasty and tender! The kale was perfectly crisped and the onions were nice and carmelized. And the sauce--the SAUCE! What WAS that?! I want to put it on everything. So buttery and sweet. My entree was the salt seared Ahi Tuna, and it was incredible. A really creative union of flavors with the coconut curry grits and spicy kimchi. I have never had grits prepared that way, with some sweetness...they were fantastic. I was blown away by the creativity of the menu and the beautiful execution of each dish. Portions are smaller than most places, but the food is superior quality, and you won't leave hungry."}, {"review_id": "1__08vQjTsKVafDbAHa1Hw", "user_id": "NVEdQEeeV-DT3pSRbDNEvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/9/2017", "text": "While our server was clearly new at her profession, the Chef certainly was not. I can forgive most blunders if the culinary offerings are inspired, creative, and perfectly prepared. This chef hit on all three.1. Inspired- when you take ingredients that don't sound like they belong together and then meld them into a wonderful, original flavor you've likely never tasted before- that's Grille 35012. Creative- when you take risks by doing the standby dishes (Tuna Tartar, Calamari, Spring Rolls, etc) different from everyone else- that's Grille 35013. Perfectly prepared- when your lobster is perfectly grilled, your freshly picked local beans still have snap, and your marbled Ribeye is a perfect medium that wants to be Medium-rare, but isn't- that's Grille 3501We typically judge a restaurant by:1. Do they deliver authentic excellent cuisine in their professed expertise?2. Do they present value based on the price they charge?The answer to 1. is that they certainly did.The answer to 2 is tough when you spend $150+ for one evening. You MUST at least endear me if not wow me with your culinary offerings if you hope to get a 5-Star for such an expensive evening. At this point, for Grille 3501, I will be returning... willing to pay that $150 as long as they take me on another equally amazing journey."}, {"review_id": "kl6sdVEY1mci7jcvi6XjnQ", "user_id": "0AC04f_iuXg7BJNGgfuZhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Absolutely phenomenal meal.
