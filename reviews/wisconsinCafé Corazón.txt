I can't think of enough adjectives to gush about it.The location: Tucked away in a corner of Riverwest off the Beerline Trail, Cafe Corazon would be the ideal destination for a leisurely summer stroll. If you're walking within blocks of the restaurant, you can smell the aroma of fresh tortillas and chorizo from the sidewalk, which is glorious. There is street parking available!The place: When reading reviews, I expected the inside to seat maybe 10-15 people. As it turns out, Cafe Corazon is bigger on the inside. There's a bar with seating and some cozy tables with mismatched tablecloths in the room off the front door, and there's also another room around the corner which I didn't explore. It also looks like there's outdoor seating, but while there's snow on the ground, I'm not looking for patio seating. The decor is eclectic and BRIGHT. Lots of reds, blues, and oranges. On the wall by our table was Saint Elvis and Saint Nicolas Cage bookended by framed representations of Jesus and Mary.The service: We were seated immediately, and our server was very kind. He made a joke about how he always comes to ask the table what they think of the food before they've even taken a bite, and true to form, he did that with us. To be fair to him, I was taking a moment to drool over my plate and take the requisite photos before digging in. Our coffee never got cold since someone was always walking by to warm up our mugs.The food: The coffee is served in mismatched coffee mugs (I had a John Deere mug which made me happy), and I would say that it's pretty decent coffee. The true star of Cafe Corazon is (of course) the food. I got the soy chorizo and eggs with black beans. You can't really go wrong with rice and beans, but the beans themselves were flavorful and the rice had a good texture. The soy chorizo...was life-changing. It was my first time having it, and I didn't realize how much I missed the taste of chorizo until I took that first bite. Now that I know soy chorizo exists, I am thankful. The homemade tortillas were small and came out hot, providing a flour-y counterpoint to the spice in the chorizo. In a word: YUM.The heads up: As a previous reviewer said, and I agree: get there early. When we showed up right at 10 AM on a Sunday morning, we were joined by another half a dozen people inching toward the door of Cafe Corazon. We'd only been seated 15 minutes before it felt like the place was packed. There is space to sit outside while you wait for a seat, though probably not ideal during Wisconsin winter. Go to Cafe Corazon. Do it..."}, {"review_id": "zQVZrQxGg1C8q9b0OZXItQ", "user_id": "97tzSamc-g31ostj3208hw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Cafe Corazone is not authentic Mexican food but it is very tasty and has good options for vegetarians. We went with several friends and everyone was able to find something they liked. Great portions at fair prices. The margaritas are the strongest in the city and all natural. I had the taco truck plate and it was fantastic and came with rice and choice of beans. Only 10.00 and it really filled me up. On the web site it says that all items are locally sourced from farms etc. You can really taste the quality and freshness...We will be back."}, {"review_id": "F-UL3563QISTvSyIIUchfA", "user_id": "XTQyonz1Sql5_d6yFGeM9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Cafe Corazon is one of our favorite stops in town and at the top of our list when we are craving Mexican food. There are so many things to love about Corazon: the flavorful and wide selection of food (brunch and dinner), the vast cocktail list, and the fun and eclectic atmosphere. The food: This is a great stop for everyone from meat-eaters to vegans. Most everything comes in a hearty portion size, so its great place to share if you're not up for indulging a bit. They have three veg-friendly substitutes/options available, all of which are great: herb tofu, soy chorizo and roasted vegetables if you want to go soy-free. The soy chorizo is definitely my favorite. There are many items that are specifically crafted as vegan already. But most options just say to pick your meat or vegetarian substitute. And as mentioned above, they have brunch and it is fantastic. Their chilaquiles are the best in town.The drinks: Obviously, you will find plenty of margarita and tequila options. But they have quite the extensive selection beyond those that are inventive and can please many palates. Also, they do have drinks on special sometimes that are extra exciting, like the recent cranberry margarita they had over winter. They know how to spruce things up and make the familiar feel unique. Their sunrise margarita is a great pairing with brunch. The space: Fun and eclectic is probably an understatement. You'll find lots of religious icons, bright colors, mismatched vinyl tablecloths, a variety of twinkly lights and fresh flowers to boot. The space is relatively small but there's a wide range of seating options, especially in summer. When you walk in there is a bar and indoor seating. That section wraps around to a sort of indoor patio, which of course, opens up to the full outdoor patio. Though this is the perfect place to be in the warmer months, it also brings warmth during the winter. Some extra tips: It can get quite busy, especially for brunch. I recommend showing up right when they open at 10 or making sure its a nice day for waiting outside if you come later. It's not the easiest place for a big group, but certainly can be done (again, if you come early enough.) Also, if you'd prefer not to be outside at all, make sure to mention that as the indoor patio section is often opened up during summer."}, {"review_id": "5pD0Ed9Zb-TyPb16dJzZlQ", "user_id": "lOvuUhY1_ujlT6uNW3u0AA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "I've waited 5...no wait, more like 6 years before visiting the edgy-but-now-more-venerable seeming cafe Corazon.  sure, it is only 2 or so miles from my house. but there's a number of excellent Mexican restaurants that are maybe a mile away. so you see my dilemma. I'll also admit I was also skeptical-  could this place ever live up to its hype?  Honestly, it did. it was one of the best burritos I ever had.They had excellent specials, a large vegan menu, and even gluten free options. I've read that this place charges for chips and salsa. it is indeed  $3, but all the burritos (regardless of filling - with the exception of shrimp) were $9.  So I feel the low prices of the entrees compensate if you (like me) must have ur chips and salsa. The bar dining area was all day of the dead decor and robins egg blue paint. I loved it. Look for the giant glowing heart - 2-3 blocks nw from the Tracks."}, {"review_id": "DgSW7Z-ZtWedgy3CD8pItg", "user_id": "ZuVIbvRKwpL0d2DIHVAs3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Sometimes you forget to give an update and this one is long overdue. Since I literally live 6 or so houses down from here, Corazon is the go to spot when we don't want to cook. In particular the seafood trio is hands down the go to meal for me but don't sleep on the brunch. The empanadas, in particular the mushroom cheddar are the BEST! Also the stuffed pepper is another favorite! Not only is the food some of the best but they also make a mean cocktail. From margarita's to Bloody Mary's you just can't go wrong. Between the awesome food and happening vibe Corazon also has a one of a kind waitstaff that make the place as fun and vibrant as you can get. Get here but you may have to wait cause the spot is hopping at any given time. So worth the wait!"}, {"review_id": "G5UcfnNnH-YRAmRIvpTgaQ", "user_id": "Kbz9G5UuXcDDKt7o8mI0nA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/1/2017", "text": "One of the best Mexican restaurants in the city.  My favorite is the lunch plate, the soups, the wet burrito, and the hamburger.  The pork is the best meat option.  Their house margarita is the only house margarita I will drink.  It's fresh, refreshing, and strong.  I think the RW location is better than the bay view.  Their outside seating and smaller footprint make it a nicer place to dine.  I ding it one star because some of the servers are less than friendly.  Get the right staff member and this is a great place for lunch, dinner, or brunch with friends of family."}, {"review_id": "kc-4wNqiHpb2WIpMaqY1uA", "user_id": "6e3yMwWtd9Qvs8NE-IPlug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Every time I've ever eaten here, it has always been wonderful!

Def more of a morning kick with the te-killa if that's what you want.Michealada: very light and refreshing! I'd recommend.Food:Empanadas Plate - very yummy! They came out hot and crispy! We got the beef and pork - both were delicious.Wet Ranchero Burrito - it was good, but not raving about it like other reviews. There was a lot but the tortilla was really thick too. Portion is large so get one to share! The outside was wet but the inside was dry so we needed more sauce.Breakfast Tacos: chorizo was my favorite but I was hoping for some veggies or some salsa with it. I had to ask them to bring salsa verde multiple times.Besides the food, I have to agree with some others that the waiters seemed unusually slow and aloof at times, too much green during their breaks is my guess...."}, {"review_id": "qsF0ZQXD_iJ94uv65LXRoQ", "user_id": "_mu197otMX_Iq_QeXiOIcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "It's hard for me to find likeable Mexican food in the city.

I can't believe it's taken me this long to get to the original location of Cafe Corazon, but I had a great first visit. It's a small little place (in winter without the patio open), but dining solo, I bellied up to the bar for quick and good service. The bartender opened with the drink specials, that included a cranberry Moscow mule. I sadly had to keep it on the lighter ABV side the night I visited, but I always appreciate a friendly server who opens with the night's specials. The room is festively colored and decorated with Day of the Dead type pieces, giving the small place a unique vibe. The salmon tacos I ordered were delicious! Served with radish, and red cabbage, and a nice house chipotle sauce, they were amazing. The wet burrito smothered in enchilada sauce and monterrey jack cheese also looked great, and I'll be back for that, and one of their specialty margaritas or drinks."}, {"review_id": "ZGKQm3-sg6Ky0e-_p4hTyQ", "user_id": "pYrMuwlz6Wujo0NM_Xva3Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Cafe Corazon is THE place to go for a magical date night in the summer months in Riverwest.  Their patio feels so romantic with it's twinkly string lights, beautiful flowers, and soft music playing.  Such a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy with your significant other!Cafe Corazon's cocktails are delicious so don't pass these up during a night out! And if you are feeling really hungry, the burrito is the perfect option for you... it is pretty much the size of a small baby, so it will definitely fill you up with leftovers to take home as well.I would highly suggest opting for a table in the outdoor patio area.  It is a great place to people watch since it sits right next to the sidewalk in the artistic Riverwest neighborhood and on the Beerline biking trail."}, {"review_id": "JfvDGUIU5oMFQS3yF8LsaA", "user_id": "NUa3uTpX-sT4ylUVqaTz9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "If this place is getting an extra star just for its proximity to my house, so be it. I started walking there now and then on the weekends for brunch. It took me longer to make an occasional habit of stopping in after work and walking home, via the Beerline trail. It's seriously so cool to have a little place this just a few blocks away.The ranchero wet breakfast burrito is perfect to order if you're really hungry. It has the whole kitchen sink in it, with some eggs and your choice of protein (including multiple vegetarian ones), then topped with enchilada sauce and cheese. I've had the chilaquiles and breakfast tostadas and they're good too. The Bloody Mary has a nice spiciness to it, and I've tried the margaritas and a few of the other cocktails like the Paloma and the pisco flower--they're all good, I don't know that I have a favorite.I've stopped in during non-brunch hours and it's a good crowd, very Riverwest--hipster but inclusive. The mushroom quesadilla is richer than it sounds like it would be, good with the spicy green salsa that they make. The servers and bartenders crack jokes behind the bar, but they get stuff done too. I see a lot of drinks get made and a lot of food come out of the kitchen.The patio is nice when the weather permits. It would be good for a group outing or a date. When dining alone I tend to like the idea of eating outside more than the reality, mostly because of wind and bugs.

I wouldn't classify this place as \"Mexican\" food, it is more like \"Tex-Mex.\" My first visit here I was taken here for brunch and was unimpressed with the food. I ordered a breakfast burrito and it was incredibly average. It tasted only of the ingredients it contained and was on par with the breakfast burritos I have made for myself at home. My boyfriend however, ordered the breakfast tacos and was pleased with his selection.It was pretty busy for brunch so the service was a little slow.Second visit here here we went for dinner. One of the waiter spilled salsa all over our table. It ended up in my hair, on my clothes, pants, purse, brand new shoes and his shirt. I understand that accidents happen so we weren't mad and he offered to \"take half off your meal,\" So I let it go immediately. Apparently that meant only the boyfriend's meal so we received $5 off of one plate after having to de-salsafy ourselves and the missed pools on the table :(Onto the food. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas which were good, no complaints there. Their salsas are pretty good and they have a \"hot\" that is actually hot. Their guacamole is pretty good and prior to receiving our meals I was a little bummed I didn't get more of it. Overall their food is okay, service is fine, patio is enjoyable but no desire to return."}, {"review_id": "v5lC8JhFXYDdfB-mcTiwhQ", "user_id": "mm8jRhfVwF_HFMMcBl0O5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/10/2017", "text": "Very hipster, healthy and cheap Mexican food.
