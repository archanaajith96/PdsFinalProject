Good apps and an exceptional salad bar with just about everything plus soups.Entrees were good with steaks being very well cooked. I had the duck with lingonberry sauce. It was good but a touch dry for my liking.Desserts were classic and both Creme brûlée and chocolate cake were excellent.Lastly, service was great."}, {"review_id": "nNVt0STf6hvruQOM7kEdyg", "user_id": "fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2017", "text": "Five of us had a very nice lunch here on a recent Tuesday.  It's a very large restaurant and they were doing a huge business, but we were lucky enough to score a round table without a wait.Our Server was excellent.  Four of us got the $11 salad bar.  For some reason, I had to be different and chose the Cajun Chicken Linguine for $12.  It was good.  Could have used some Cajun HEAT, but everything was cooked nicely.  Others loved the salad bar.  It's a clean, nice restaurant that has managed to maintain a nice quality level over the years.  Menu is varied.  Prices maybe a tad high, but yet it's one of the nicer restaurants in Sioux Falls.  Would definitely go back.Nice bathroom too.  :)"}, {"review_id": "tEI8PjyFxZ-nUiPIUMkTTw", "user_id": "1SxVCbQ5N46-Jga-80YRHw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "Ate here for lunch. My table mates all had the salad bar which they raved about. I went with bacon wrapped meatloaf with mashed potatoes onion straws and some cheese/ cream sauce. Was an excellent choice. Meal shockingly looksLike desert when comes out but itIs most certainly not  it is truly great. Only reason not 5 stars is the Coke was little flat and bread just ok."}, {"review_id": "V6UvUdKqCMvkO8c7HhKRWg", "user_id": "pEwcXGswqpUyk-FkhJEz1A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "Great atmosphere and service. We enjoyed the bar area and a great bartender that knows how to make a great martini. In fact all the staff are awesome and take great pride in their service.The food was pretty good overall. We started with a local appetizer that was outstanding. I can't recall the name, but it's a local favorite that seemed to be filet medallions flash fried and seasoned with garlic and herbs. I should have just made those my meal.The soup was like warm at best when we got it, so had to send back. The staff handled it great and the second shot at it was very good. My ribeye was ok, but not what you'd expect at a high end steakhouse. It was cooked well, but didn't have the great seasoning that our appetizer did. It also was missing that great ribeye searing and seasoning that makes this cut of meat so great when done right. For desert we split so things, of which the creme brûlée was best. I would recommend this place due to the great service, but would recommend something other than the ribeye."}, {"review_id": "FnOf0bXM0GXFFaDw2rRkUQ", "user_id": "fQQM3BAkRSLFMxglCCxO_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2017", "text": "Simply put, this is the best steakhouse/restaurant in town.  It has been in this location for years, and keeps getting better.The service is always top notch, but not over the top.  Reservations are recommended, but not hard to come by.  If you forget, sitting at the bar is not too bad, but the seating is limited.The salad bar should be world famous.  It is not huge, but everything on it, is of the highest quality.  Don't miss: the cheese spread.The Minerva's steak is my absolute favorite.  The menu describes it perfectly.  They say that the walleye is also one of the most popular dishes.  If you are from out of town and want to taste a Midwest specialty, go for the walleye.  If you are a local, go for the best thing on the menu, and get the Minerva's steak."}, {"review_id": "4j8Fb_VFLHoiMN_GLOQMQg", "user_id": "1LZ9gj5EW8o4Op22ssJZ6A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "Was passing through Sioux Falls and was looking for a nice place to have dinner and was recommended this place by the hotel concierge. Although it's listed as one of the more expensive places in town, if you're looking for a nice quiet dinner with an upscale feel then look no further. The drinks were strong and the food was tasty. They had an optional salad bar but we settled for a entree which proved to be more than enough food.

I have dinned at the Minerva's in Yankton, Bismark, Aberdeen, Watertown, Rapid City and Sioux Falls. If you're from out of town I suggest trying Minerva's if you're debating on where to eat. I do suggest getting there early enough in the evening or lunch to avoid a wait. You can sometimes snag a seat at the bar if you time it just right.They do take reservations so I suggest calling ahead or just make a booking on their website. Things to try:The Salad Bar is awesome! My favorite is the Waldorf Salad with whipped cream. Also note the Salad Bar is the same for lunch and dinner except they remove the smoked Salmon at dinner time. Just so you know, the smoked salmon is yummy! The Tomato Zucchini soup is amazing!! You can order this soup whether you're having the salad bar or just table service. If you're from out of state I suggest trying a South Dakota appetizer that's not found anywhere else in the country: My only twist is to have some ranch instead of BBQ sauce to dip it in:   BEEF CHISLIC - \" A South Dakota Classic! New York Strip, Garlic Salt, Fresh Herbs, Bold BBQ Sauce.  $11.00\" My favorite main is the Honey Peppered Salmon. You can't go wrong if you like fish! I've had this for nearly 10 years here and it still makes my mouth melt!"}, {"review_id": "teLt5xS0wprk7BI8i2Kdcw", "user_id": "m8B8lcjI2u-Tfl5WE5owXw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/9/2017", "text": "Not my usual type of place but they were good in a middle of the country way.
