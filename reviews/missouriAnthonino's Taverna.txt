I also ordered anchovy pasta on the side. We both liked the beef tenderloin a lot. The meat was very tender and not overcooked. It came with mashed potato and grilled onion which were both well cooked. The portion was big enough for us to share. Tiramisu was nice surprise - it was very moist and came with a strong coffee flavored bottom layer. I wasn't a fan of their ravioli - it was a little dry and not enough filling. The pasta, by my standard, was overcooked since I prefer it al dente. The flavor was ok, not memorable.The free bread with olive oil was a plus. Our server was welcoming and attentive. She came to check on us multiple times even though we came in at busy dinner time."}, {"review_id": "bZZsOSiWtIrx7Zeyh5EXsA", "user_id": "M1fk_IYOyZBKIw6ov8Q9hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "It's really nice to have a family friendly, fairly inexpensive and high quality restaurant choice. Anthonino's delivered on it. There are a lot of tables inside, but you aren't crowded. Decor is simple yet updated and pleasant. Staff too were all friendly and fully competent.  You not only enjoy your food, but the whole experience. We had to get toasted ravioli appetizer, since that is one of their claims to fame. There's a good reason for that. They were among the best I have had: oversized so that you get an even mix of dough and filling with each bite, crispness that still allowed an easy bite and chew, and a large amount of high quality meat filling. House salads are Greek salads. They are pretty standard Greek salads, which is not a bad thing - just an accurate description. Meatballs are another item Anthonino's is known for. Since we weren't ordering a dish with them, I asked about adding a meatball on the side, and our waitress said that they have a two meatball side order. So there you go. And I'm glad I did. These were huge meatballs in a semi-sweet marinara sauce, made with well seasoned and finely minced meat. I wasn't really sure what entree to pick, so our server suggested the Palermo style chicken. It's really just chicken piccata. But was also a very good choice. Thinly breaded/dredged chicken that was tender and juicy, with a slightly tart sauce and generous capers. They do a good job."}, {"review_id": "KtwR_82H82zgQqBgiqHZ7g", "user_id": "I3MY8158DoNn5lqHIXpLDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I mean talk about gourmet Italian food, this place was absolutely amazing. The pasta was so fresh and tasty, definitely not out of a box. I had clams over pasta in a olive oil sauce. It was out of this world! I was still eating it after I wasn't hungry. The cocktails are different and definitely house made. I love the fact that they not only keep the Italian traditions, but also create cocktails with a modern American twist. We had white wine and it was fantastic, although I don't remember the kind or what it was named. Thanks Anthoninos for a fabulous dinner for those traveling to St. Louis!"}, {"review_id": "Gkngw9d2c1hozgLQXK9bdw", "user_id": "cZohBzgCY3B4Fbd25GHHLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "I've a bad experience at one of the Italian restaurants on the Hill and unfortunately haven't been back. That is until our friends had recommended Anthonino's. I thought I'd give it another shot.My spouse and I visited on a Saturday around 12:30pm. The wait for 2 was about 25 minutes, so we decided to instead sit at the bar. Thankfully there were two open spots, so we didn't have to wait.The hostess warned us that service might be slow at the bar, but I didn't notice. Our server was really busy, but she did a really great job attending to us at the bar.We split an order of the toasted ravioli and grilled salmon pasta with capers, red onion in garlic butter sauce. The toasted raviolis were very good. It wasn't just filled with straight up beef, it was a mixture of beef, ricotta, and pecorino romano cheese. I think my favorite part of the appetizer was actually the marinara. The marinara was really really good. You could've thrown that marinara on some plain pasta, and I would've been happy. My spouse ended up soaking the remaining marinara up with bread. I also enjoyed the grilled salmon pasta. There were a few pieces of red onion that were burnt, but the salmon was cooked perfectly. I only wished there was more of the salmon. The pasta tasted like it was made in house. It had just the right amount of bite.I'll definitely be back. Thank you to Chelsea and Zac. Your recommendation has made me a believer of Italian on the Hill."}, {"review_id": "ENGBjXcn_HwZCBraTb9D2w", "user_id": "A84BDSbdQPdqtvS_DHx62Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "This place is a classic family favorite serving a bit of Italian and a bit of Greek. I find the cozy atmosphere to be a bit more updated, brighter and less stuffy than other places on The Hill. They have bar, booth, table and patio seating, so take your pick. They have a full service bar that serves the full lunch/dinner menu. The service here is good and it's a safe bet that you'll leave satisfied.  Must try's: toasted ravioli, pizza and salads. T-ravs are some of the best I've had. Love the pizza--plenty to share and you can get different toppings on each 1/2. Don't forget to get a house salad with your pizza-yum. A couple of the pastas I've tried were a bit on the salty side. I would shy away from the pastas if you are sensitive to salt or consult with the wait staff about it before ordering. I've only dined on the Italian side of Anthonino's and can't wait to go back and try some of their Greek menu items."}, {"review_id": "bZA3jdFAIvDcF7LREL-bSw", "user_id": "Hxx8FmhpxiugIrGRh8RDOg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "I've had Anthonino's bookmarked since they opened, I think.  We finally decided to try it a week or so back and we weren't disappointed.  The ambience is not classic \"Hill\" - more nice Italian.  It's pretty darn loud in here, at least in the front room.  We had the old stand-by clamari as an appetizer, then shared steak mudiga.  Our daughter had a provel and mozzarella pizza.  All of these dishes were very good, if not amazing.   The pizza was pretty special - the crust was light and delicious.   If/when we come back, I wouldn't mind trying a more \"loaded\" option.  Based on the piece I had and what I saw coming out of the kitchen, I'd say you can't go wrong with the pizza. We are regulars at a couple of the Gianino's restaurants, and Anthonino's is very comparable.  If it were more convenient, we'd probably be regulars."}, {"review_id": "2tGoTWGHwZOmKOXRbKvLbg", "user_id": "7EW4MDbFBheg4Z63eX_ERg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017", "text": "Anthonino's is amazing! The food is homemade, authentic Greek and Italian. Every bite was more delicious than the next. From the homemade toasted ravioli and pickle chips to the warm Vitale's bread with fresh olive oil to the Palermo Chicken with capers and olives, each dish was served freshly prepared and plentiful. These hearty rustic dishes are the reason for a 30 minutes wait on a Monday. But seriously, the food was worth the wait! We waited at the bar with a glass of Prosecco and a Blue Moon.

After working a 15 hour day I almost had decided to just go to the hotel and order room service. So glad I didn't. When it comes to trying a new Italian place I almost always go for the pasta and meatballs as a gauge to determine if they are truly authentic. I was not disappointed. I ordered an extra meatball and headed to my hotel with a heavy bag of pasta heaven. I couldn't even wait until I started my car before I had to taste what I had bought. Good thing I opened the bag because the lid had come loose and some of the sauce was spilling out! Travesty averted! I opted for the Bolognese sauce which was a good choice. It was meaty with a hint of bitterness but not in a bad way. The sauce clearly had red wine in it and was so good! The meatballs were dense and spicy and were what added the weight to the bag. The pasta was perfectly cooked. I'm excited to return and have a proper sit down experience on my next trip to St. Louis."}, {"review_id": "h7cKtEyUTbLsrOcCUZAONA", "user_id": "F7NNPatuHN_Weg1h0n5jag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "All I can say about this restaurant is wow!!!!It absolutely lives up to the hype and then some. We absolutely loved our experience from beginning to end. When we first arrived at the restaurant without a reservation, we were greeted warmly and were asked to wait for a few minutes until we could be seated. Although there were probably 10 people waiting we only sat for maybe five minutes.Once seated at our table and we're warmly greeted by the vivacious and charming Christina. She immediately made us feel welcomed and excited to taste some of the incredible looking food that was flying by. She told us about the chef specials which was pumpkin ravioli served in a cream sauce and a spicy sausage lasagna with a Bolognese sauce. We enthusiastically decided to order both chef specials. My only experience with pumpkin and pasta together happened to be at this amazing little place in Rome. And I still remember the taste of this pumpkin lasagna that I ate on my last trip there. I certainly have never experienced food like that until I have visited this restaurant. All of the memories came flooding back to me about that incredible trip to Rome, that is truly how good the food is at this restaurant. And how authentic the experience is to true Italian cuisine. Both dishes were absolutely flawless. As was the service Christina is truly the warmest server I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with and she further enhances the complete experience. I can't wait to dine there again and I really hope they have the incredible pumpkin ravioli because I've been dreaming of it ever since. And I definitely want to go back and have that dish again.  I highly suggest that they add this to the menu for at least the fall because it was unforgettable!"}, {"review_id": "dF9nq-0EYCyHdecLFUELYg", "user_id": "1VS1FGKEsPTMdO1Rn7QAJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Very tasty.

If it were, it'd be Ant-onino's.I found it to be one of the most overrated places ever, the only reason I give it a 3 and not a 2 is because Julie liked the toasted ravioli. They wouldn't change a large bill even though.I mean I can see this place doing all this business and taking all this cash and they wouldn't give me change for a 100 or a 50. It's just kind of ridiculous. Especially when they're charging as much as they do for the toasted ravioli. They had some weird convoluted excuse why but the place had masses of people in there, plenty of them paying cash, so go figure. Boo.Also the gyro here is nothing to write home about.

Some of my favorites for dinner include pizza and dolmathes.

I ordered the squid ink pasta and it was exactly as anticipated - salty and tasting like the sea (no other way to put it) without being fishy.I did try the toasted ravioli but can't say I liked it very much.
