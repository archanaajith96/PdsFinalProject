The pit-master, who goes by \"Papa,\" is warm and inviting. I got to shake his hand and hear him talk with pride about their accomplishments. It made me so excited to try the food! I decided to go big and try as much as I could for my first time eating here. I got a three meat plate with brisket, sausage, and rib tips. My total was $18 and change. I got these meats based on reviews here. The flavor of each meat was good, but my favorite was the brisket. True smoke taste, good seasoning on the bark, and it pulled apart easily. My only complaint is that it was a bit dry. Not as dry as the rib tips and sausage, though. It feels like they may have been precut and lost some of their juices that way. I probably won't get the rib tips again because they were the driest of the three meats. For my sides, I got the potato salad and the baked beans. I was happy to find that there weren't raw onions running through the potato salad. It was a little dill pickle-heavy, but that was fine with me! The baked beans were the best beans I've had in a long time! There were chunks of meat and peppers in them, which really complimented the awesome smokey taste. Going back, I'll have to get more brisket and beans for sure. I may try the ribs and the chicken too and give those a review, as well. This place is definitely worth a try and I would highly recommend anyone stopping here while in the area. They take pride in their food and it shows!"}, {"review_id": "N9Fe-VpKFgsrliamzBQWxw", "user_id": "F8LUFtsfYxawdDTiEolEkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Amazing.  Real wood smell as soon as you hit the parking lot.  Only gets better from first impression. Had the everything potato.  It was huge and filled with generous amounts of every meat.   Meat had great smoke from first bite to the end.  Also had brisket sandwich.  Great brisket flavor.  Couldn't ask for more. Service was first class the whole time as well.

They both needed a lot of help from the tasty sauce. Both meats were bland and had texture issues... the brisket too chewy and stringy and the ribs too fatty and too much meat stuck to the bone... we all agreed on these.Cool atmosphere.Price is a little high.We would return for again to try \"The Saint\" which is macaroni with rib tips or some of their tacos."}, {"review_id": "FG8JzlE5acU3aKh6-95zqQ", "user_id": "_l8xI0MCMZz2B9hSzelXhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Real BBQ = 5-star BBQ & 5-star service!!!Look no further than Real BBQ and More to satisfy those hunger pangs at their new location on Fairfield Avenue! Locals and visitors come from near and far, making Real BBQ and More Yelp's #1 rated BBQ in the Shreveport-Bossier area. Drop what you're doing and hurry up over here- the sooner, the better!First time here and don't know what to get?! Get the jalapeño cheese bun with brisket and the amazingly delish ribs! The jalapeño cheese bun is what takes this sandwich out of this world. You can ask for BBQ sauce on the side for any of your entrees. Good BBQ doesn't need to be drenched in sauce. Don't forget to satisfy your carnivorous appetite with the fall-off-bone, finger-licking-good ribs- just do it!!! Everything here is good! I don't think I've had anything here I didn't like. Just remember to come hungry and ready to eat your heart out! Mr. Harvey is very accomplished in the fine art of BBQ with never-ending passion and enthusiasm. He loves what he does and he loves bringing joy to others in the form of good ole southern BBQ and friendship.TL; DR: Go get your BBQ feasting on at Real BBQ and More!"}, {"review_id": "L98A4_tQ5bcbGc7D8bMylw", "user_id": "yG-gVyQi5NHlhTtpo0LePg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "We showed up on a Sunday night at 7:15 with a group of 12 and they treated us like royalty.

I ordered a 2 meat plate: ribs and brisket with corn and mac and cheese for sides. The brisket had a nice crunch on the outside and super moist and juicy on the inside. It pretty much melted in my mouth. The ribs had a really good smokey flavor. The portions are huge and the price is very fair. I ordered this for lunch and ended up eating the other half for dinner becuase i could not finish it in one sitting. The restaraunt was also very clean and service was pleasant. If i ever have to come back to shreveport, i will come back for more food!

She made suggestions to my order that saved me money. The only problem - it took a very long time to get our order!! Good but slow service. Finally, the food. I got the rib meal with 2lbs of meat (chicken and shredded beef). I didn't try the beef. I was over impressed with the chicken but under impressed with the ribs. The ribs actually tasted cold.
