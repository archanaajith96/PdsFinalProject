With that being said, Rochester is a small city and there's not much competition so I can't imagine it's that difficult to be the 'best'.It feels like a very old-school bar-type burger joint on the second floor of a building. Windows are small so there's not the greatest view, but service is great and fast. Our waiter told us that by far, their most famous burger is the Marvin's Burger so of course, I had to try what they're known for. Being the mushroom fanatic that I am, I substituted the bacon for mushrooms though. The burger wasn't bad, but it most certainly wasn't made for all the hype of being the best. It was an all around decent burger that just really, tasted normal - nothing out of the ordinary. The fries weren't crunchy or impressive either. Free popcorn though. I'd likely try some place else next time I stop by to visit Rochester."}, {"review_id": "0KKB36k-HYompY5hIMY4Mg", "user_id": "3Mfg-vwK9CRfjTBMxQamSw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/9/2017", "text": "Came here after hike at White Water State Park. We came in the afternoon on a Saturday and wasn't busy at all. Service was excellent, but food was just okay. I kind of expected more for best burger joint in Rochester. I got the juicy lucy and my friends got the Marvin Burger. The juicy lucy was simple. Just the bun and the patty with American cheese inside. I felt the cheese was all concentrated in one end of the burger and wasn't a big fan of their American Cheese. The bun was good though. The burgers also come with fries and they were okay. I like my fries a little more thin cut and less potato-ey. They also serve free popcorn for the table, which is a plus. I love popcorn. It's not super buttery, but it's good addition. Overall, it's an okay burger joint. There's some better choices in the Cities."}, {"review_id": "v4aKcDO20uklY9-AQM34zw", "user_id": "NvDrK2fvNlRfOOMMEoAFCg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/29/2017", "text": "As much as locals seem to like the place, I was disappointed with it. I know it's the style of decor but it just seems a little dingy and dark inside, which would be fine and personal preference if they stuck with the sort of late-80s-wood-type-semi-retro feel, but the flat screen TVs randomly poking out of the middle of the wall sort of ruined that - there wasn't even an attempt to incorporate them subtly.Service was friendly and quick so no complaints there, but when my burger came out it was sort of ... mushy. It was juicy but it was definitely not only the natural juices from the meat, it was a bit more watery and generally just gave me the feeling that the burger had been defrosted only minutes before from a deep freeze. To compound the problem, the burger bun was definitely too soft and sort of absorbed the watery juice and got a bit soggy. The fried onions were also maybe just a touch stale, although I did like the bleu cheese which was perfectly crumbly and melty. To their credit though I had asked for my burger medium rare and this was the first place I've been to in a while which has actually given me a medium rare burger and not overcooked it.Slaw was good but really not enough to make up for the mediocre burger which I was really expecting more from since Newt's claims to be the best burgers in town and also gets so much lip service from locals. If I were to be in town longer I'd definitely try a few other places before I tried Newt's again for burgers."}, {"review_id": "0ZbueUruOnf5W1jyzOvq3Q", "user_id": "SPmaZWRB_6RqSifoMw4dsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "Hands down best burgers in town.

This is very much a sports bar that plays popular 80s and 90s rock music. The server will bring you popcorn when you first sit down. The staff is generally very nice.

While I did find the atmosphere to be enjoyable and the staff to be helpful, when it came to the food I didn't have the same wonderful experience.First things first, I must disclose that I'm not a burger fan, so it may be ironic that I'm reviewing a burger joint. Newt's is a great place for people of all ages, so I've only gone with my family who all love burgers. In terms of food beyond the grill, there are a few choices, but they all left much to be desired. The chicken sandwich in particular is very bland and none of the other salads or sandwiches I tried were better.On the positive side, the service was spectacular and the staff was very knowledgeable about the menu. Even when they were busy I've never experienced a ridiculously long wait. Another plus is the free popcorn you can munch on while waiting for your food! Unfortunately for me, that was the best part of the menu.
