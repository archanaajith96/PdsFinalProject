We had a bunch of good food this trip however Kokkari is one of two stand out places I'd go out of my way to return to.The service was excellent and the execution of every dish was impeccable. Even small details like the bread, salt and oil impressed. Two of us sampled their saganaki, grilled octopus, spanakopita, and skillet prawns small plate / appetizers. Each one amazing. We shared the lamb chops entree which was pretty much perfection and finished off our meal with a piece of flourless chocolate cake.  It was maybe too much food but in some ways the perfect amount. There are so many dishes that we wanted to try and didn't get to.  You could easily just as the waiter / waitress to bring you anything and you'd be in Greek hog heaven. I wish I lived in this town so I didn't have to wait so long until my next visit.

Felt like I walked right into a common room (what we called social lounges) at school, if they suddenly specialized in fancy Greek food.Came by for a celebratory lunch, so there were lots of things on the menu to try.  Overall, everything was tasty and portion sizes were large. For appetizers, we had the zucchini cakes, grilled calamari, and grilled lamb riblets. The zucchini cakes didn't really taste like veggies (in a good way, for all the usual veggie avoiders), and the texture was stringy and easy to cut into with a fork. The grilled calamari had perfect texture-- easy to chew and cut through, but not undercooked. The feta in this was melted down, and wasn't too pungent. I didn't notice the bulgur wheat in this. Good grilled flavor. The meat on the lamb riblets easily fell off the bone. The gamey flavor of the lamb here was fairly light, and it had just enough chewy portion to be tasty but not difficult to eat if one was at a fancy business lunch. Meat texture was bouncy and juicy, though more moisture would always be appreciated.There was a bit of a wait between the apps and main courses, but we were a larger party and the place was packed (packed!) on a Monday at lunch. We got the ravioli, amisio souvlaki (grilled lamb skewer), cretan pilafi (brown rice with butter and lemon rice with greek yogurt), and patates sto fourno (potato wedges with oregano and lemon). The ravioli was not as al dente as other higher end restaurants I've had, but the filling did stand out in terms of its taste (you could really taste the freshness of the spring veggies and the pine nuts). I would have preferred the filling to be slightly less pulverized, but to each their own. The grilled lamb skewer was strong in lamb flavor vs. the riblets, and while the meat was not super tough, it definitely could have benefited from more moistness and seasoning. The brown rice was fairly standard-- good as an accompaniment but didn't stand out on its own. The potato wedges were also standard-- super hot and melt in your mouth insides, but I love potatoes generally. Overall, I think the apps (3.75/5) were stronger than the mains (3.3/5).We finished with the vanilla ice cream and baklava. Really good vanilla ice cream has that special je ne sais quoi about it-- I think it's the bean bits that really make the vanilla flavor pop. The baklava was pretty standardly good. I preferred them separate (3.5/5). The Arnold Palmer I got was heavy on the tea, but with the ice (and passing of time), the concentration of tea to lemonade was good. The cappuccino I got was super foamy on top (so much that you could spoon it out and eat it), and wasn't overly sweet. Wait staff was quite magical when it came to putting down utensils without you noticing!"}, {"review_id": "wINuPywqS1QR23SleuhSGA", "user_id": "yutC5VcVrmVjqQvY0dU6EA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "My husband was away on business for my actual birthday, so he reserved a table here for later in the month because he knew that I've been wanting to go in such a long time.

When the earthquake hits and all these restaurants are leveled, I'd bet a decade from the quake people will be like, man, remember Kokkari? Best restaurant in SF. All of these other cool restaurants will be an afterthought or forgotten entirely.Be prepared to have the best Mediterranean food you will have in California, possibly the U.S? Preparation and execution are to the highest caliber. Seasoning, temperature, texture, everything is just buttoned down and on another level than anywhere you've ever been.I've been a few times over several years but standout items are the duck confit dolmades and the goat stew. I've also tried a couple lamb and fish dishes which were very good, but I don't recall them as specifically as I do the above dishes. They have a robust wine list that will match any aspiring sommeliers tastes.The only thing is that Kokkari is that to me, is not particularly approachable. There are a lot of old rich people. The restaurant is always busy, and service, though attentive, is very formal.It is still, without a doubt, one of the best milestone / celebration restaurants in the city and I will forever recommend it."}, {"review_id": "l6veOdjSYRftwgi52aRTEA", "user_id": "EJszEuYW8Iphw4b88SwWHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "I was in town for business and this restaurant came highly recommended by one of my coworkers from the area.

There are hints of cinnamon so it's a little on the sweeter side. If you've never had goat, it's a little Gamey but full of flavor. Definitely worth trying!Dessert: while I wasn't in love with the  Galaktoboureko, I loved the pistachio ice cream. It and actual pistachios in it.

Most unusual dish was a fried cheese that was served sizzling hot. Possibly my favorite savory. The potato dish was a bit disappointing, while the salad absolutely hit the spot, fresh and crunchy. A fava bean dish was okay, it's flavors reminding me of a lasagna without the noodles. Ambience - darkened interiors would suggest romantic but during daytime hours felt more comforting and cozy. The u-shaped booth took some sliding of the butt to to get situated but thankfully our server pulled it out so we could slip in and out.Service -- our waiter was knowledgeable but not pretentious. Everything he recommended was spot on. He was attentive but not hovering which made for an unhurried and relaxing meal.Price -- on the high side but worth the calories and cost.Wouldn't typically mention the bathroom, but here we had to take an elevator down to the basement to get there.

Problem is, finding a reservation for a normal dinner time without much notice is near impossible. (I'm not the best at committing.) Finally, on Friday, February 23rd, I came here for a friend's birthday. I believe he made reservations about six weeks prior for our party of six at 10pm.*Meat Dolmathes - grape leaves stuffed with lamb, rice, dill & mint ($16)*Kolokithokeftethes - crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing ($12.25)*Spanakotiropita - traditional filo pies of spinach, feta, leeks & dill ($10.25)*Octapodaki tou Yiorgou - grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil ($17.75)*Garides Skordates - wood-oven roasted prawns with feta butter & Kalamata olives ($17.25)*Soutzoukakia - grilled lamb meatballs with spiced tomato sauce & Greek yogurt ($14.35)*Psari Psito - traditional grilled whole fish with horta & lemon, Lavraki - Sea Bass ($47)*Ippoglossa - halibut steak pan roasted with black lentil salata, roasted grapes, artichokes & pomegranate ($38.25)*Arnisia Paidakia - grilled lamb chops with lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes ($47.50)*Goat Stew Special ($38)My favorite dish, hands down, was the rack of lamb. Super meaty and flavorful. Even the bday boy who doesn't like lamb enjoyed all the lamb dishes at Kokkari. (I guess he finds it too gamey.) I also adored the octopus and prawns. The octopus was tender with a nice chew. The head on prawns were great for sucking. I do love them delicious head juices. The sauce was also amazing. Great for bread dipping. I'm not eating deep fried foods right now, so I couldn't try the zucchini cakes. Everyone seemed to enjoy them though. They start the meal with complimentary bread and special olive oil from Crete, which is a treat.*Baklava - Traditional walnut & honey baklava with vanilla-praline ice cream ($10.50)*Galaktoboureko - Semolina custard in filo with fresh Meyer lemon spoon sweet & pistachio ice cream ($10.75)*Loukoumades - Traditional Greek doughnuts with honey, cinnamon & walnuts ($10)*Rye Manhattan: up ($13.50) x2*Old Fashioned ($12.50) x3*Bulleit Rye ($12)*Turley, Old Vines Zinfandel, California '15 ($52 bottle)*Graham's 10 year Tawny Port ($12)*Blandy's Malmsey Madeira 10 Year ($13)*Fonseca 20 Year Tawny ($15)*Greek Coffee - Stone-ground coffee heated over hot sand, Sketo for no sugar ($6)We all started with one cocktail each for the apps and then had a bottle of red to share with our mains. I believe the sommelier helped us pick out the zin as we weren't sure what to order. It worked perfectly with our mixture of meat and fish as we had one in our party who wasn't eating meat. Dessert was a sweet treat. I couldn't eat some of it since it was deep fried, but the baklava was definitely tasty. I adored the ice cream. I got the 10 year tawny port to pair which I enjoyed.Such an awesome spot for a birthday celebration. Between the food, the service, and the drinks, I was amazed.

I'd probably put it at a 3.5The lack of cocktail list sucks and our \"house\" cocktails were pretty weak. We had a reservation and we're still seated close to 30 min after, so 830pm on a Thursday. We're new parents, it was our one night out and we had reservations; 30 min is a long time to wait. Not to mention the bar area is full and crowded so waiting there wasn't an option. The lamb is delicious but at $40ish, pretty pricey. The fish although cooked well and a nice piece, was not good, topped with a tomato sauce and olives. Personally, I just didn't think all the flavors meshed well.The apps were good, nothing to write home about, but enjoyed. The pita with the dip was amazing, another order of pita costs you $4. The donuts for dessert were delicious! We wrote in our reservation and I also told the hostess it was my husbands birthday and they did nothing. That, plus seating us close to 30 min after our rez, kind of not the best customer service. The place is beautiful, and the food is good, but the popularity detracts from a real authentic and relaxing experience and doesn't guarantee an on time reservation.

Delicious Greek food, classic decor, and consistently kind service every time. I've had the pleasure to try Kokkari a few times without needing a reservation because it quite close to my husband's office. This is probably one of the few restaurants I know in FiDi that is almost always jam packed even during weekday lunches. That said, it hasn't been a problem to walk in for a table of 2 during lunch. I do recommend making a reservation for dinner, any time of the week, because they are nearly always at full capacity.Food is amazing, and the service is on point. Making it understandable why this is a popular destination for important lunch meetings. In general, everything I have had there have been executed well with no disappointments from any of the times I've been. I think you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, so it's mostly a preference of what you prefer to eat. Overall, the underlying flavors for all of their entrees are pretty similar, with their signature Kokkari dressing. Inspite of that, the seasoning is light and allows the flavors of the ingredients to really shine.Might I also add that their dinner bread is crusty on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I appreciate that a little bowl of salt is provided at the table for you to adjust the amount of seasoning in the olive oil.Here are a few of my recommendations of favorite dishes. Do take note that if you mention that you and your party intend to share dishes, they will separate entrees onto 2 plates for you. Certain dishes, for presentation purposes, are left on 1 plate. Dinner and lunch menu's are mostly similar with the exception that dinner has more appetizer and dinner entree options. Appetizers:Roasted Beet Salad: I love beets. These are perfectly roasted and tossed in a thick greek housemade yogurt with a wonderful sprinkling of pistachio dustOctapodaki tou Yiorgou: grilled octopus! Marinated and cooked to utter perfection. Probably the best I've had, second just to Dio Deka in Los GatosArnisia Plevrakia: grilled lamb riblets. These are SUPER tasty. Juicy, burst of flavor. Cooked to tender perfection.Spanakotiropita: spinach cheese stuffed in phillo dough. It's very light, airy. Entree:Psari Psito: roasted whole fish. The fish variety changes everytime I have been here. I love their branzino (sea bass), and greek red snapper. All have been cooked in the wood-fired oven with the perfect amount of lemon, oregano dressing. Very nice, well flavored and fall off the pieces. No bones because the chef has already complete deboned it, except for the head. Price varies from $35-50, depending on the fish.Arnisia Paidakia: grilled lamb chops. I've always been a fan of lamb chops, but a lot of places tend to overcook or marinate them. These were SO GOOD. Juicy, kokkari dressing, easy to slice my knife through. Awesome. If there is one thing you HAVE to get here, I'd say it's a lamb or the fish.Arnisio Souvlaki: grilled lamb tenderloin. These were also delicious. I would say on par the lamb chops, perhaps slightly easier to eat. It's very succulent, well flavored, paired well with their thick cucumber salad tzatziki. It's like eating little cubes of lamb steak- order medium rare.Moussaka: one of my favorite Greek dishes, but hard to find one that is not greasy or overdressed. I like to think of it as a eggplant, ground lamb pie, with a bottom of puree'd yukon gold potatoes, and a floating cloud of bechamel custard to top it all off. It's freaking delicious.Desserts:No brainer, if you're going to pick 1, go with the Baklava topped with a praline ice cream. Beautiful combination, perfect ending. If you're going for a home run, and can make room for it, I also highly recommend \"Galaktoboureko,\" which is a filo pastry stuffed with a custard, paired with blood orange and pistachio ice cream to cut through the richness.Overall, you can't go wrong with Kokkari. I think it's one of the must-try restaurants if you're ever in San Francisco!Prices are steeper, but as are most nicer restaurants in FiDi, so if you're going to treat yourself this is a nice place to go for. I'd say lunch per person runs around $50, and dinner around $80-100 per person.

I couldn't really taste the feta, but it was still creamy and delicious in the middle.x Psari sto Fourno (wood-oven roasted with potatoes, autumn vegetables, persimmon, charmoule) - ordered this with snapper and it was just ok. Stick with the branzino. There's a lot more flavor. We ordered deboned, but it came with SOOO many bones.. it was a huge turn off for me.x Ravioli - This ravioli was pretty bland :( I remember the first time I went to Evvia I ordered ravioli and it was also bland.. not sure if it's a Mediterranean thing.In all another great dinner.
