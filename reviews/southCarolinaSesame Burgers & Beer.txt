But when I give a one star review, believe me, they've earned it. The sad fact is that the service is ALWAYS terribly slow, even long after the lunch rush. I tried going in several times. Maybe I had one bad experience. No. Consistently slow. Today I ordered a burger medium rare, and it came out well done. I even asked the waitress to verify that the burger was well done. By this time I had taken several bites to get to the center. So I was nearly halfway done by the time she even came by to check on me. She asked what I wanted to do about it. Well, since I was well into this burger, there really wasn't anything that could be done. I didn't want to wait an extraordinary long time again for another burger, which may or may not be cooked to satisfaction. And I'm not even talking about just a little more cooked that medium rare. We're talking NO pink. Like they put on the burger, went out for a smoke and forgot about it. For a burger to be cooked so far beyond - she should have offered to take it off my tab. Of course, I'm too embarrassed to ask for that. I'm not that person. But maybe I should have. This hockey puck was a crime against meat, and I think she should have at least offered to take it off my tab or offered a free burger next time, thereby asking for a chance to make it right. Sadly, there won't be. Pass."}, {"review_id": "bW7r5YV4s1zgP0pbHZuY5w", "user_id": "TnokU_E5RiaUWTlRy4D-hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "We stopped here on our first trip to Charleston.

Where does that take us? We drive to North Charleston to our favorite Sesame location. Sure we have a location nearby, but this North Charleston location is the original and never fails to be the best. Started with the sweet and bleu - a delicious combo of sweet potato fries, bleu cheese, prosciutto, red wine reduction, and green onions. My taste buds had a party!My hubby had his huge burger with a side of cole slaw. I had my salad with fresh salad greens, sherry-orange roasted beets, shredded carrots, pickled onions, roasted walnuts, and the wonderfully marched goat cheese vinaigrette. What did I you say to dessert? A must try is the milkshakes. For tonight, I indulged and had the adult shake known as Toffee Coffee. A lovely blended concoction of espresso vodka, heath bar, and ice cream.

PLUS we had beer wanted beer. This location is smaller than it looks, a few tables up front, a small bar that seats about 8-10, then larger dining area in back. I get this place is borderline bar vs restaurant, but I personally don't like the dark lighting. Then the bar is situated right in the middle of traffic with customers walking by to tables, and the servers picking up orders behind you at the kitchen. But there is no changing all that.We sat at the bar, reviewed their beer choices, but found out due the storm their draft beer list was limited. We then chose bottled beer, and ordered onion rings and the sweet potato fries. Our beer choices were satisfying - River Rat Kolsch (SC state), LoFi Mexican lager (local), Westbrook One Claw (local), High Wire Bed of Nail brown (Asheville). The food was also good bar food. The onion rings were large rings, with very crispy coatings that remained on as you cut them. The sweet potatoes were delicious, served with blue cheese then broiled, plus a red wind reduction dipping sauce. Perfect appetizers for the day. Service was good, nothing to shout out about, both bar tenders were engaging and friendly. Overall a decent afternoon stop for beer and bar food."}, {"review_id": "MvWhDT0usuDIS5jllXjvqQ", "user_id": "0NbBgkwo3DbdycerTyeptQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Best burgers around.

I got the beef well done and they did it right, I like the char, but not dry meat, and this was perfectly done. The seasoning on some fries was so heavy I didn't enjoy them as much and the bottom ones were a bit soggy, might have been sitting just a bit to long before getting them to the table, thus the minus one star. It does take a bit to get your food, but worth the wait. The price is pretty steep, I guess I just didn't think I see the day a burger was 12.00 for meat, bacon and cheese... glad my awesome bf was paying!

My burger also came out warm but not like super warm, just warm as though it had been cooked then sat out for awhile (my cheese wasn't even the slightest bit melted on the burger) Maybe the chief was just having an off day, I don't know.  Overall, I don't think we will come back here, at least not to this location but maybe to a closer one to get another brownie sunday and shake because they were really delicious.UPDATE:The general manager contacted me, so we will give this place another shot.  She was polite and apologetic so I do have to say that it seems they do care about their customer's experience.  I'll move it from 3 to 4 stars."}, {"review_id": "h9eR0QEe2zWb6GVl5kWeeQ", "user_id": "F1RAjIuWQSS6hE9LolD8fg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "A MUST in Charleston!

Let me count the ways. First, if you're not ordering the house mustard (not the stuff on the table) you're missing out. Second, the patty melt is one of the best I've ever had. Couple that with fries or the pork skins and pimento cheese dip, and you've got a recipe for success. I love their fries, and I'm the weirdo that dips those fries in the house mustard. That tang is addictive. They always have a great selection of beers on draft. Their adult milkshakes are some of the wife's favorites.

Yesterday, I wanted those sweet potato fries with their homemade smoky ketchup. There's nothin like it! My girlfriend has never been to Sesame and she's lived here awhile. Being that this was the first restaurant I was taken to in Charleston, I was appalled and told her we must go. She was down.When we got there, it was packed and super busy. We were seated fairly quickly, despite the crowd. The waitress came around wanting to know our drink order and those came quickly as well. We finally settled on what we wanted (I can't get past the Park Circle burger...so good) and placed our order. We were chatting for a good bit when my friend looked at her clock and realized we've been waiting almost 45 minutes. The waitress, as if on cue, came around and took my empty beer can (yes, ....we were waiting awhile because I don't drink beer fast) and told us she would check on our food. 5 minutes later, our food was out. It was cold. My burger was overcooked. My friend and I were disappointed. When the waitress swung back around to ask how our food was, we let her know that it was cold and overcooked. She wanted to remedy the situation right away. I let her take my burger to have it recooked. Almost right away she came back with a fresh one...saying the burger just came out. She also came out with hot steak fries for my friend. It was definitely hot and cooked to my liking! Then the fresh sweet potato fries came out and all was right with the world. What a speedy recovery! I know it isn't her fault and the restaurant was just busy. I won't hold it against them. They gave us 50% off our check and a free dessert....which I necessarily wouldn't have needed to be happy since they quickly got a replacement burger, but it was a nice touch. My friend said she loved her burger and Sesame has kept my business...I will keep bringing friends and family here to share the delicious! Thank you Sesame!"}, {"review_id": "YEOSCgiAbRMnTed3axqL6g", "user_id": "8QsUGo5EI40rZyQJ9HFSaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2017", "text": "This was one of the first restaurants we tried when we moved to Charleston. We were bummed about having to break away from our go to burger place in Atlanta (Vortex) so when we happened upon this place, we were overjoyed. Aside from the food, I am big on ambiance and comfort when dining out. When you walk up to the place, you find people communing over a game of Cornhole out front. The inside has a nice warm feel to it. I always request a travel against the wall because, well, Sheldon Cooper and I share the same views on seating. Anyway...Their food is amazing. I typically order a fried chicken sandwich with pimento cheese, pickled okra, picked red onion, and lettuce. My sides vary from the Mac and cheese, fries, and the marvelous cucumber and tomato salad (that I have tried to recreate at home). We were sad to learn that they took hush puppies off the menu because they were so dang good. Also, If you have any room left get a milkshake. I've never been able to get the adult shakes bc I want to take it to go, and apparently that's frowned upon.. Basically, we (my husband and I) will always come here. This is our new go to burger place since moving here, and until something can top Sesame's burgers, we are here to stay."}, {"review_id": "4_MCbUKhN2cgjdZbg3mtdw", "user_id": "HhkJiu2WWWp7SkgqJBo0jA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "My second time visiting Sesame.  Both times were four-star experiences.  The reason they don't get five is the price of the burgers.  $12 for a burger, with a standard side.  Not crazy expensive, but just a little much to me for a burger and fries at lunch.  Welcome to Charleston I guess!  Tried the Diablo burger today and upgraded to onion rings for $1 extra.  The sauce on the burger added a nice flavor, but I didn't notice much from the pineapple.  It only had a tiny bit of heat, so don't think the name \"Diablo\" implies it's super spicy.  It's not.  But it was really good, and really messy to eat.  The onion rings were just okay; too greasy for my taste.  Have a thick batter and not enough onion inside.  But the BBQ ranch dipping sauce that comes with them was very nice.  It helped hide some of their greasiness.  I also ate some of my gf's steak fries.  They have a really good seasoning on them.  Enjoyed them more than the onion rings.  They're good with ketchup or nothing added.  I recommend them if you like steak fries."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sesame-burgers-and-beer-north-charleston?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
