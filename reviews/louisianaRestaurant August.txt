It did not disappoint. The decor is amazing and the service really set the bar for our first restaurant in NOLA. Before we arrived, I checked the dress code as a lot of the nicer restaurants in NOLA have a dress code and I read that it was suggested that men wear slacks and a button down shirt. One of the guys in our group wore a jacket, but it didn't seem required as the other guy in our group stuck with slacks and button down. We gals wore dresses, I had heeled booties and my friend wore dressy sandals. We almost ordered the chef's tasting but decided to just order a bunch of dishes for the table. We started with cocktails, there were delicious and then moved onto a bottle of wine. We ordered the following:Wagyu beef carpacciopotato gnocchi - this was one of the highlights, if we all had more room we would have each ordered another plate for dessert and not shared it. Out of this worldpotato crisp P & J oysterscrab tagliolinicane syrup lacquered duckling - this was amazing, and there was a little piece of foie gras that was amazing with each bite!Home Place Pastures porkRaines Farm beef strip\"Dirt Cake\" cocoa nib panna cottadark chocolate buttermilk dropsAll of the food had incredible attention to detail and was so delicious. The four of us shared all of this and we were sufficiently full and ready for bed when we finally made it home.Overall, don't skip this restaurant when you visit in NOLA, it will not disappoint!"}, {"review_id": "DhOOcjxWhu-3fxWf6UgAvA", "user_id": "iq04VwxGCSwqLBYylbNq2g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I've heard so many wonderful things about this place, too bad it wasn't true.They is no valet parking which is a hassle, they offer free parking at a lot across the street but the staff didn't provide the correct location or the address of the lot.The service and food.There were 7 of us. Some dishes were not correctly served and a steak had to be returned and a wait for one diner really screwed up the meal. I'll never be back.

We just spend five days in Nola and this was our only repeat...we closed out two days here. Once just for drinks and dessert.A single diner next to us confessed she had slipped out on her conference banquet to dine here and asked what was good. Everything is exquisite was my reply, cause it is. I have never been disappointed, from that cute little egg shell to the sweet little bites delivered with the check. If I had to choose my last meal on earth, it would be here with that ever changing menu."}, {"review_id": "VFTSdhIL3JDwikJfxzYHOw", "user_id": "HX02LFgHMPhURVxADIWvyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "​I think it's only safe to say that they do fine dining like no other. With the hefty price tag you pay for dinner here, they service is impeccable and the food is absolutely divine. 5 stars, 5 stars, 5 freaking stars! There are a total of 3 people (head waiter, front waiter, and back waiter) who will make your experience just absolutely perfect. If you get Robert and Jackie then you hit the jackpot. They made my first experience unforgettable.I don't remember the names of the cocktails we ordered, but it was nothing short of amazing. You can't go wrong with anything! If you like a sweet wine, you must try their Riesling. It's life changing! For appetizers we got the potato crisp P&J oysters, which was absolutely exquisite. Even though it's fried, it was bursting with flavor. My boyfriend ordered the cane syrup lacquered duckling, which he loved. I ordered the home place pastures pork and it just completely blew me away. It's an absolute flavor journey, trust. Although their desserts are constantly changing, I had a dessert with affogato and what can I say? It was delectable. The flavor of all of the food we ordered was unimaginably, crazy delicious. August is a place you want to experience if you are looking to have the PERFECT dinner, or even just for the experience itself. Other fine dining restaurants are really, really good, but Restaurant August truly outdoes itself. It was about $200 for 2 people before tip. If you want to splurge on food you have to pick August to do it at! It's worth every penny for a special occasion, that's for sure."}, {"review_id": "CVflDTQk7KadzD1yvqiFog", "user_id": "p6Ix9I3LjiRxahwhUl06FQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "A vegetarian tasting menu? Yes please! It was six courses of creativity and deliciousness.

When we got there for our reservation, the hostess kindly ushered us to our table, where we were given a complimentary egg custard, it was delicious. We shared the potato gnocchi to start, made of blue crab, black truffle, and parmesan, and we ordered the five spice duck breast with the wagyu ribeye to share. Both were absolutely phenomenal. We left full and satisfied.What bumped this rating from 4 to 5 was the quality of service, as well as the welcoming ambiance. The restaurant screams classy - fancy chandelier, well dressed staff, etc. While we enjoyed our meal, there was a family enjoying their meal with a young child (crying somewhat, but overall not an issue), and also men dressed in suits. I got a vibe that, while catered to impress and create a classy aura, it was welcomed for everyone. I highly recommend it for those looking to have a quality meal."}, {"review_id": "b8YVtBKVD2ObECmjZCLRIg", "user_id": "8Kjf1ulh1ox5RiO42UI4IQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Possibly the best meal in my life! I had the potato gnocchi to start with blue crab, black truffle, parmesan and the five-spiced breast of duckling for my main with grilled cabbage, lentil, duck ham, foie gras. I also had a chance to sample the lemonfish cru with kumquat, bok choy, sesame.The real star of the night was service. I know I was sitting at a table where someone was familiar with the place for probably the last 40 years but we kept getting chef specials, including some experimental dishes, delivered to our table that were off the hook. Yes, I am not going to expect the double dinner experience on my next visit but that's besides the point. The point I am hoping to make is that everything was so good it wouldn't matter since it is the quality and not the quantity to look for here."}, {"review_id": "VlRGiGqxzzOtSrEjaP4yJw", "user_id": "_efP61KpqeC9K4TX0aqwyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "We had dinner here the other night after hearing some pretty fantastic feedback from local friends and it definitely has reason for the reputation.The ambiance of the restaurant is intimate and classy in a restored building with grand chandeliers and beautiful large windows. The first room is a small waiting room and bar. Low lighting and definitely tiny enough that I imagine people get pretty snuggly during the dinner rush. The dining room is separated by a glass door Our server greeted us as soon as we were seated and brought us out an impressive wine list. My husband discovered his new favorite Riesling and I had a phenomenal Malbec. Our server was knowledgeable about gf and was very accommodating even asking the kitchen to alter a couple dishes slightly making them gf for me.The first thing we tasted was an amuse-bouche in an eggshell. It was a very interesting flavor and an even more interesting texture. My husband described it like eating clouds that disappear on your tongue! It was an epicurious beginning for sure! Next, I had the spicy crab with cheese grits that they made gf for me and the sauce and texture of the dish were incredible. My husband really enjoyed the potato gnocchi as well. My entree was a venison loin which was served with delicately prepared accompaniments and had a very nice sauce with it. The sausage was not my favorite but that was personal preference. My husband had the pork and loved everything about it. We were too full for dessert but appreciated the complimentary chocolates and pralines they brought us. All dishes were beautiful and artistically plated.This place certainly delivers on complex flavors, unique and high quality ingredients, and overall provides a delicious meal with professional and attentive service. It is going to be a higher priced outing but they deliver on all accounts so it is certainly worth it."}, {"review_id": "tlVF0f5zRHFaW7rxUO-mtQ", "user_id": "1evw5XBKCHB_No5GZ7HP9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "It's still worth planning your NOLA trip around a Friday lunch at August.  The 3 course pre-fixe lunch is a fantastic value at $28.Service varies between good and world class.  A few years ago August was worthy of 3 Michelin stars.  Currently, it is 2 star experience and in the debate of best restaurant in New Orleans."}, {"review_id": "Z3PTb3b7eUWc-5Z2u2SA_A", "user_id": "NZ87ZISv0wrqSwNObZ-7yg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "We came here for Valentines day dinner and our last night in NOLA. It was a great choice. The dining space was hip yet upscale. The service was awesome and the food was amazing (for the most part). We got the shrimp and crab ravigote to start and it was an amazing way to start our meal. It was fresh and delicious. We then had the potato gnocchi which was so full of flavor and so delicious. It was an extremely small portion though, I wish we had had twice as much. For the entree we had the scallops and the flounder. The flounder was absolutely amazing. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was SO GOOD. The scallops on the other hand were not that great. They seemed to be seared too much and not cooked right. They were a darker brown on the outside and then rubbery on the inside. They were fairly unpleasant to eat and we actually left a scallop behind (something I never do) because of this. I was okay though because the flounder was so good. I really liked this place and would recommend it. I'm giving 5 stars because mostly everything was perfect."}, {"review_id": "5RJrpIuhixP-lgev0lz4mA", "user_id": "Jc8AaWiqsi8xTXcyasvSZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "We arrived fashionably late, despite the kitchen closing at 10.

The grand dining room is opulent with high ceilings, chandeliers, brick walls and flowers. The service was professional and polite. We ordered right away, and waited, and waited... Since we started drinking, we were also desperate for food. And since the appetizers were not coming out, I've ordered some French fries right away for the table. We were seated promptly at 7pm, and unfortunately our appetizers did not come out till after 8:15 pm. What was in the lag? The Shrimp étouffée were tasty, but the highlight of the evening was the Foie Gras Three ways. Beautiful presentation and delicious!! Our entrée Seared Scallop and Home Place Pastured Lamb were also good, but unimpressive flavors and forgettable.

I had the sweetbreads for my main while hubby had the steak.  Both fresh and tasty.  Sweetbreads lightly crisped on a bed of cheesy creamy grits... a tad salty, but that worked in its favor in my opinion as the serving wasn't intended to gorge on... crazy thing is, I am NOT a grit fan, even a little... but I guess I technically can't say that anymore I can't recall which dessert we ordered, the chocolate one?
