The reason why this place succeeds is because they're honest with their portions- we all know that this is an AYCE place, so obviously we assume that they're going to fill us up with rice and send us home. BUT, that's not the case here. They have good size portions mixed with good size fish content as well. Their main menu is filled with lots of unique and interesting dishes, of which you can also order when dining for AYCE option. Their staff is not intentionally being rude, they're just busy AF all of the time, so all they can do is take your order and hand you the dish when it's ready. You gotta understand it from their point of view.... Overall this place is fantastic- the place is being worn down quickly just because of the sheer density of people coming in and out of the place. This place is popping for a reason, I dare you to go try it out and see for yourself! You won't regret it!"}, {"review_id": "J0Pt1Beh8_2qv-E7p9Ig5w", "user_id": "kjjIO6WE7sF3s7OcImgtxA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "I went here on valentines day where they advertised a free glass of champagne per couple. I was sitting with my gal and a gay couple. The ignorant waitress really made it awkward when I asked for champagne for the table. There is 3 men and 1 woman....we were so shocked that in this day and age there are still idiots out there that don't know basic manners and how to treat ppl. This ruined what should have been a wonderful evening!! The food was nothing special....small portions....all you can eat was meh! Better flavor from sushi at King Soopers and Safeway!!!Not worth the wait!!!!"}, {"review_id": "tKK5O1r-z3SubmcCpLCNeQ", "user_id": "3Cod7voqhkzYhWL8_3AH4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "First time coming here for sushi while my girlfriend comes to this location for AYCE sushi all the time. The Nigiri was okay but the fish really has no taste to it imho. A sauce is usually placed on the fish and it out power everything else. It's around $26 per person at night time. Experience wasn't disappointing and the place can get really packed if you come late!

The price is great for AYCE and they have a huge variety. Because lunch is cheaper, they do not have the more extravagant rolls like they have at dinner nor the expanded nigiri menu, but their lunch is definitely varied in selections. The place is ALWAYS busy so I suggest making a reservation or you're waiting for about 30-45 minutes to get in, but it'll all be worth it. The staff is nice, but it seems that some of the staff can get overwhelmed and sometimes, you have to flag your server down, but at the magnitude that they are serving, I can be patient.I love ordering their stuffed jalapeno at dinner but beware because the heat of the jalapeno can very from very mild to extremely spicy, but delicious nonetheless. One thing to remember, you WILL be charged for leftover food to avoid people from over ordering and wasting food. I like this concept and I think it makes people mindful about being wasteful."}, {"review_id": "sICksNIgMT03QsdtZfcCLA", "user_id": "jXTtbrv8jhHDKJVMBxQvOQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "It had been years since I have been here, and I've always remembered this being a solid Sushi option. I would still recommend tying the AYCE here, but there are good and bad things about this restaurant that should be mentioned. The good:\"All You Can Eat\" includes appetizers, some noodle dishes, and most specialty rolls (for dinner only).There are many sushi options to choose from, the nigiri has the right amount of rice, and the sushi is reliably fresh.The drink specials are cheap. They have three drinks that are always $3 and great Happy hour from 4-7.The restaurant is clean and interesting, surprisingly well decorated for what the strip mall might lead you to assume.The crowd is diverse in every way possible, which is  representative of the neighborhood. The bad:The service was inconsistent. I sat with an empty water cup for about 10 minutes, even though I asked for more. Two items we ordered never came. There wasn't an assigned server to each table. At other establishments, this model works well. Here, it left us feeling rushed. We were asked if we wanted to order more by about six different people, but weren't checked on in a way that felt genuine.There's always a wait on the weekends, when they don't take reservations.The sushi is good, but it's not the best.I gave it 3 stars this time because from the food to the service, the focus seems to be quantity over quality."}, {"review_id": "F8zE9QF7QF-WFJbNV1-IPA", "user_id": "NFEbX-8Xdsq5T0p7e2qzwA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Show up hungry and this is not a bad deal.

The lunch menu is an abbreviated version of the dinner menu, but it still has the essential rolls and nigiri pieces. I usually get 20 salmon and 20 seared pepper tuna, which usually comes out in 5-10 minutes. The service is usually fast unless it's  a weekend or a holiday. A lot of my friends enjoy the BBQ beef, which is a Korean style rib meat. I've seen them devour over 75 pieces at lunch. Don't forget to order calamari or salmon to take advantage of the tasty variety at a great price. My only reservation from giving five stars is my one bad experience with a waitress who accused me of having no manners even though I had patiently waited in line to get seated. I understand it was extremely busy and she might not have meant it, but as a customer who frequents this location, it ruined my experience that one time.

I have been coming here for years. YEARS. The pieces of fish are much skimpier than they used to be, and the fish itself sits out for a long time and loses its color. Even the salmon nigiri pieces were flavorless and the rolls didn't have very much meat! I went here for dinner last night to try them one last time and I was amazingly disappointed. The pieces are so small! And they give you SO much rice to fill you up. Hey everybody, if you want decently sized pieces of fish, go to Sushi Totoro in South aurora off Quincy and Buckley. It's the same price but they will take much better care of you there."}, {"review_id": "1aySvTQ5GGTdZVqI_H3wnQ", "user_id": "d5Zda1xm1OM_REAIuTRCAg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "I love how Katsu doesn't have a lot of rice with their Nigiri.  Having eaten at a lot of AYCE sushi places, that is what is so upsetting with other places.  The chefs and servers work hard here.  They kind of have to when they are at their busy times.  Having been here twice already, they seem consistent in their product and service.  Having only been here for the AYCE, I can only comment on the quality of their dishes during All You Can Eat.  Their sashimi and nigiri is fresh and made well.  There is a good amount of items to choose from, and i haven't had a bad bite from what I have had.  The rolls however is a coin toss.  I have had some really good ones here  like the Volcano Roll, and Caterpillar Roll.  But I ordered the Salmon and Jalapeno roll and that was immediately depressed and angry at the same time.  This is basically a whole jalepeno stuffed with... stuff.  This is something my son would serve me when he has his mind set to playing outside and not giving a crap to what I eat. Service is also another coin toss and how you see things.  Both times I have been here, it was very busy.  I see the servers scrambling to meet orders and make sure everyone is getting served.  I also see the sushi chefs cranking out dishes like they are robots.  With that said, I have experienced them messing up my order but it wasn't a big deal.  It was busy and I still got to eat. The location is something that could frustrate anyone. It's not enough parking space.  Consider yourself lucky when you find one.I would definitely come again.  When you go, try the hot apple saki.  You will get hooked."}, {"review_id": "fWgt7dBq9E3-bv1B3cFG9g", "user_id": "0IRbD9uJpsUidICrWtB-Zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Best deal for all you can eat sushi.

There is plenty of seating for small and large parties. My family and I were quickly seated as soon as we stated we were a party of five. It did get busier by 6-6:30ish, where people ended up waiting for tables.All the severs, waiters, waitresses, etc. serving us were all very helpful, friendly, and had smiles on their faces. We each decided to feast on the all you can eat (AYCE) menu. It sort-of reminds me of a dim sum menu where you mark off what you want to eat with a small pencil.It states that you will be charged FULL price on whatever you don't complete so my family and I didn't dare not to finish anything, haha. Also, no take out on AYCE leftovers but that's per the norm.. I think.We ordered a bunch of nigiri, a few sushi rolls (California, cucumber, and volcano), mussels, beef teriyaki, calamari, miso soup, seaweed salads, edamame, BBQ beef, and shrimp tempura udon.The calamari could have used more squid, it disappointed tasted mostly of fried batter. The shrimp tempura udon broth was OK, my kids didn't like it and that's strange since they are udon addicts.Husband thinks the mussels have too much mayo, something you can easily scrape off.The sushi itself isn't phenomenal but it is still tasty and quite filling if you're looking to stuff yourself to your fullest potential.Would we come back? Definitely! If you're hungry and just craving sushi and other Japanese assortments, Sushi Katsu will hit the spot and not break the bank."}, {"review_id": "MAEUpkovfYFxuE-2JY2rMw", "user_id": "pPDftrYpfthYeDKuxNo0eg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/13/2017", "text": "I went here two times with my friends.

But to make up for that, she gave us the mochi ice cream for free  I really love it. The second time, my friends came first to take the table, then I came around 2:30pm. I didn't know that the restaurant closed at 3pm. They didn't say anything when I first come in, then I didn't sit down yet but the waitress yelled at me \"hey will you order anything before we closed\". Omg I was so embarrassed with my friends, so I didn't order anything. I just share with my friends. Definitely it's my fault to come there when they're almost closed,  but they didn't tell me first.
