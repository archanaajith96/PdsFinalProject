I arrived early with a cake and the staff put it in the kitchen. I sat at the bar and the bartender was very helpful. My friends joined me later before we were all seated and I was surprised that our drinks could not be added to our dinner bill.  We paid the bartender and requested a table in front of the fireplace.The decorations were still up from Valentines Day and it was very pretty with hanging roses everywhere.  The fireplace was beautiful also.I was not very impressed with the food. It is very expensive and the chef lacks presentation.  The dishes look very ordinary.  I had the salmon with risotto. It tasted fine but nothing special about it. My three friends dishes were plain as well.  One of my friends asked if there was any seafood in her bowl as a few clams sitting on top of what I think was Paella.  When I compare Basta  to Meritage or Spain, the presentation is definitely lacking.The waitress wasn't very friendly or engaging. She was not informed that we had a cake in the kitchen and gave us dessert menus.We had a nice time and once the waitress found our cake, she brought it out with a sparkler on top. Another staff member gave us little bags of candy left over from Valentines Day which was very nice."}, {"review_id": "FUAk8gADbblnM59NzpnlBA", "user_id": "qDXrhZFMdNo_SUONthpj0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So am I need to update my review and I returned almost a year later to give Basta another try. I will admit that the service the food and everything about this experience made me rate this five stars over the three stars I previously gave a year ago. The chicken dish that I had a year ago was removed from the menu I was glad to see that. This time I got  the chicken Parmesan which was out of this world. It was spot on. The chicken was cooked to perfection, the gravy a little on the cooler side I would have liked it a bit hotter temperatures wise. The pasta was cooked perfectly as well. I had to update my review as this experience was very very different and all the food in my party was perfectly cooked, tasted wonderful, and I was extremely happy that I did return even though it took me a year to do so.I definitely recommend the chicken Parmesan and my friend got the tortilini with shrimp and he loved it. The wine selection is one of the best I have ever had as well.Please save room for this cheese cake that they offer. It is by far the best in the state and the Italian cherry topping is so delectable unlike anything I have ever had.Bravo Basta you went from 3 stars to 5 stars for this reviewer. I definitely will return."}, {"review_id": "Wa8xSseTw-tX8uhku5ttdg", "user_id": "Xnw4PzVoKfJqTtFF_eOa4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I lived in RI for many years, yet never discovered this gem until I was visiting friends this last week.  I live in Florida and the food I miss the most is Italian and Basta hit the spot.  The red couches, the lounge singer, and the formally dressed waiters all set the scene as we walked in.  Seeing the RI governor dining their too on Sunday night made me giggle- that's RI for ya.  We sat in the outdoor patio which had heaters and temporary enclosures which was pretty warm considering the temperature outside.  The patio is so beautiful!!! I'd love to have  a private party there.  I can't stop thinking about the tiramisu and espresso martini I had.  U must order the tiramisu.  For my entree I had the lobster ravioli which was very good- just had a little more of a spicy kick than I would like but I'm a wuss when it comes to heat.  The dish was a decent portion, cooked perfectly and had a nice amount of lobster pieces.  I'd love to go back and try other dishes.  Next time I visit RI, next time."}, {"review_id": "z8U3AyFCm_zZ5nONlhz_Wg", "user_id": "6pTHuzch57b5uvHDqjMvqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "This was such a pleasant surprise of a dinner.  Being lactose intolerant, I don't usually look forward to going to Italian restaurants or places known for pasta.  Usually everything is covered in cheese, and I end up getting a salad.  This was not the case at Basta!Everything was delicious from apps to drinks.  I told our waiter about my dietary restrictions and he could not have been better about it.  He pointed out everything I could have, or what could be made dairy free.  I ended up having a fantastic pasta dish, and more than 1 cocktails!Definitely go here for a romantic evening or a night out with girlfriends."}, {"review_id": "e7Q5PQ2QcoD9BLYF5QkF1w", "user_id": "RVDUPINcVXzsDavDJcsmGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Very fantastic place.

Makes sense. When we left Basta last night, we had what can only be described as \"that Thanksgiving feeling\" (aka: stuffed & needing a nap).All bites and sips at Basta were incredible. There was a brief moment where I thought I would be giving 4 stars due to the price$$$, but every dish delivered. Fresh ingredients, good portions, and amazing flavor combos. Specific Highlights:_ Calamari appetizer. Amazing. Some of the freshest calamari in recent memory. And the sauce was so good I began dipping the complimentary bread in it._ The margarita pizza w/ chicken. Though the chicken was a little too charred, the pizza itself was supremely flavorful, filling, and (again) fresh._ Ravioli. My husband loved it. A lot. He particularly (and consistently) commented on the amazing ragu. The cocktails were also great, as was the prompt and friendly service by Michael, our waiter.Basta is officially leading the pack of my favorite Italian restaurants in Rhode Island. Partire!

Smartly decorated, a professional staff, a menu with varied choices, and light music all make for a 5 Star experience. Even though it was a last minute reservation, the staff was able to fit us in. The first thing one notices is that the chairs are comfortable. We've all been to a restaurant where it looks nice, but it's not very comfortable. Our server was fairly new to the restaurant but she was excellent and was a pro. My chicken marsala was perfect and filling. I had no room for dessert. The one thing was that the bartender wasn't great at making a pear martini. First attempt was bitter and only the second was slightly better. However the espresso one was fine. This restaurant is one of the top restaurants in RI, and deservedly so."}, {"review_id": "RbP8aMGoy1UgB8p17BxaPA", "user_id": "6nG_PDFmof4iwDHglfDmZw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Wanted to try a new restaurant ...Hostess was nice, -The bread was too hard.

Love. I just realized I have never yelped about one of my favorite places. The back outside area in the summer is such a wonderful place to be. The ambience is on point. Big umbrellas, couches, and a cute bar. Perfect place for early afternoon drinks in the sun or a great al fresco dinner. The winter is my favorite at Basta when they have the fire on and you can still sit in the enclosed area outside. There is nothing better than a glass of wine at the seats in front of their fire. The eggplant is so good and their pizza is perfect. The tortellini vodka is one of my favorites. They have a very large wine menu and almost any drink you can think of. They even have sparkling rose'... YAY! I had never been to an event at Basta until recently. My friend had her bridal shower here and it was gorgeous. Alex the manager and his crew did a wonderful job. I strongly recommend Basta for any occasion."}, {"review_id": "lC288WTcNDPUUVLztVL5WA", "user_id": "X9fyEA0gKXE3Dx4PuM7EHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Basta is mu go to when I want Italian food.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is homey and service is fantastic.

Loved the ambiance inside the restaurant. Went through the back and they have an outside patio and bar. Meatball Pizza was too thin for my liking but was tasty. Zucchini flowers small and not worth the price- everyone has these on their menus this time of year and have had much bigger ones at other establishments. Also not too hot in the center. My short rib ravioli was fantastic. My husband got the orchietta but said it was dry. He ordered a side of sauce to pour over it. Food wasn't  piping hot but legit came out in under 5 minutes- Had to ask for bread. Garlic oil was great but bread stale.

Many usual southern Italian offerings, some as low at 17.00. Of course there were steak and shellfish choices too. Most meals came with potato and there were other sides too.    I chose Veal Saltimboca because I like it but mostly because it was more expensive and I wanted to pad the bill.  I know, silly.  It was wonderful, tender, tasty, covered with cheese.  Rather than the potato croquette that came with it I had Rigatoni which was cooked well but could have used a little more sauce.    Spouse chose a Ravioli with the kitchen sink, (leeks, goat cheese, pistachios) in a Short-Rib Ragu. That was incredible.  Next time I'd get that.     We hadn't had apps so there was room for desert.  We shared a Special consisting of salted caramel Gelato, moose, chocolate and a \"fudgy\" \"brownie\" \"ish\" thing that was tops (. Lord what spellcheck put me through to write that!)     There was an incredible wine list starting in the low 20s but approaching 200.00. More than 50% were Italian but the west coast was well represented. Only one from Oregon though.    The staff, three of whom we interacted with, were incredibly nice and helpful.  Restrooms are M-F, very clean and up scale and large enough for two at a time.    Negatives were the volume, it was quite loud, despite sound absorbing ceiling tiles, until two large tables of young women, out on Friday night, finished and left, and parking.  For our 7:30 reservation both their lot and the nearby banks lot were full requiring a hefty walk, fine in summer but cold on a blustery 28 degree evening.    So, great food, great service, minor inconveniences lead me to say I'll return sooner rather than later.Forgot: there are two outside seating areas, one plastic enclosed with a nice fireplace and one total outside for nicer weather."}, {"review_id": "wWcW8Z9TYTTaKiic2OEmBw", "user_id": "00ci8maLEEOEuhOKeh0iLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2017", "text": "This was the 2nd time we visited Basta and the food was awesome!  The first time we were not that overly impressed considering all the great reviews that we had read.  I think it is because we tried traditional dishes, i.e chicken parm and didn't explore the menu any further.  With that said, our meal last night was excellent and we cannot wait to visit again. My husband and I ordered and split the meatballs, beet salad and the sampler pizza.   The meatballs: an appetizer with 4 decent sized meatballs with San Marzano sauce topped with ricotta - yummy and full of flavor. Would I get them again? Potentially but I would explore the menu more firstBeet salad: roasted beets with dollops of whipped goat cheese, walnuts and sprigs of salad topped lightly with a balsamic vinaigrette. This was the best beet salad we have ever had, delicious delicious delicious.  We were raving about it while waiting for our pizza and really wanted to order another. This is a must try!Sampler Pizza (Quattro Stagioni): had two slices each of four different types of pizza.  We have yet to try the prosciutto pizza because we were so stuffed and took it home.  We tried the salsiccia, 3-cheeses and roasted red peppers slices.  In my opinion the best was the roasted red pepper but all of them were delicious and worth trying. I would definitely get the sampler pizza again. The best part of the pizza was the crust, so light and airy.
