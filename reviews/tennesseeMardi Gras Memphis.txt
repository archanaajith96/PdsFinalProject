I visited after work one night and I am a fan forever. The food was great, the staff was friendly, and the prices are awesome. I had a cup of New Orleans style Gumbo and a Po Boy and boy oh boy were they good! The drinks are amazing and will definitely hit the spot after a long day. They have different drink specials throughout the week, so be sure to take advantage of that. The location is just the right size (not to big, not to small) just enough to have a great time with great people. I sat at the bar and another frequent costumer came in and sat next to me and we shared laughs and conversation as if we new each other forever..lol! Do not pass this spot by! Try them, you will not regret it!"}, {"review_id": "WdCUoG6qM_KOgw1DU-QusA", "user_id": "6d0NvATpz1V9lyqPEHJZ7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "By far the best food find in Memphis, when in town for work. Some coworkers and I went here after work one day, based off the awesome Yelp reviews and we all just kept saying \"oh my... this is so good\" pretty much after every bite we took. My one coworker lived in New Orleans for 2 years, so was exposed to this style food. I asked what he thought and he said \"it's definitely the right taste (spices and all) and it's pretty hard to beat there. He loved it. I loved it, my other coworker loved it, other patrons responded that it was unbelievable as they were walking out the door. I can't believe I also ate the awesome garlic bread! Update: came back with a different coworker yesterday. We both loved it. He left his credit card here and instead of just running in today to pick it up, we decided to eat here again... 2 days in a row. I had the Mardi Gras pasta and was not disappointed. When we joked about being there 2 days in a row to our server, she had informed us that we were her second table that had been there the day before as well. And then I noticed a guy walk in. He was there the day before as well. The reason I recognized him was because he was one of the construction workers at a new project nearby, and he had the same pink hard hat. I then pointed him out to our server and she responded that he comes in every day.  So there ya have it. YUMUpdate: I understand it takes time to make food taste so good, but not 42 minutes! It's taken a bit on previous visits but never this long. Me and some coworkers couldn't help but to come back since we are in town for work for 2 days. We arrived at 11:06 (I checked my watch when I read the hours on the door) and were seated. We were the only ones there and our order was taken a few minutes later (after drinks were delivered). At 11:45 our food finally arrived.  I mean seriously folks!"}, {"review_id": "DMSXt6oxuL9lMlKC44UVOg", "user_id": "8wFDKYw60rbVVWbAKrGRFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "I love this place! We came for dinner tonight. They were extremely busy but we were greeted as soon as we walked in. The server asked if we'd like to sit at the bar. Although I usually don't, I did this time. We had a tad wait on our food because they had a few big parties but it was okay. Beth, the bartender kept us entertained with conversation and with her art of making drinks. The Moscow Mule is a hit. Despite the wait, our food arrived& was delicious. Seasoned perfectly. I had gumbo & Filet Etouffee! I'll definitely return."}, {"review_id": "SvOCIQUtbFwq8Pb8CTxiCA", "user_id": "ungvf-MPW7P7ZzLMW_48Rg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Dropping to 3 stars.

My girl usually gets me geeked up about places but this is one she spoke about and I've known her to go a few times but she never made sure I knew to go so I kinda have been underestimating this restaurant but now I know this the spot especially when feeling like having some New Orleans food!

The customer service was the best I seen in a long time Penny is so sweet her added care alone would make you want to come back. I ordered the hurricane, it was strong not some watered down replication and definitely reminded me of being back in my town. Ordered the wings with the hot sauce, I could eat them over and over and over again guess that's why I ordered another batch after I swallowed down the first. For my entree I ordered the crawfish Alfredo, and I have to be honest my Alfredo sauce was more like soup then a sauce  I could literally spoon it out of the plate after eating the pasta. I love my Alfredo sauce to be thick not runny.  All that said would I come back again? Hello yeah if only for the hurricane, wings, and Penny's service it's more then worth it."}, {"review_id": "Wi2ZcoyngUHAXd8DhRbS4w", "user_id": "ZfP11YJqTmc_RUdSXfm1tQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/1/2017", "text": "4 of us came here for dinner last weekend. We sat on the patio and listed to the Sax player. I've been here once for lunch, but this was the 1st visit for the rest of our crew. Everyone absolutely loved the overall experience. Our waiter - Hillary - even bought a fan outside once he saw the flies were gathering.2 of us had the Mini Mardi Gras Sampler, and 2 of us had the Mardi Gras Pasta. I thought the pasta dish was one of the best I've ever had. Tons of chicken, sausage, shrimp with it. The wives loved their samplers - 3 each 4 ounces of chowder, gumbo, and etoufee along with a big piece of fried catfish that was excellent.They had a drink special - $3 for a Strawberita? Nice flavor, all our drinks were very good. Can't wait to go back and try something else."}, {"review_id": "9p9KHTboLoKx-XUN11A0Uw", "user_id": "aJRnjwJ3D4Knl9pRwOfKDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/7/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I love the concept here and the fact that this restaurant is helping to bring life back to the Crosstown community. The pricing on the menu is pretty awesome.  If you're a large family, you'll definitely get the most bang for your buck. The food itself is really flavorful.  My side salad was delicious.  I love when restaurants really dice your salad into bite-sized pieces.  The dressing was on par with the salad.  Blue Cheese dressing is hit and miss.  This was a hit. For my main meal, I got the chicken and sausage gumbo - what a savory flavor.  No to-go container - no leftovers. The rice that accompanies the gumbo was cooked to perfection.  The staff was eager to make sure diners had a good experience."}, {"review_id": "_Fe05CU5dDUkxmoKXXi8vA", "user_id": "f_MDkIpzJh9F2T7SpVKDUQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Wooooo baby!

It's rare that I find a place (in any city) that does genuine New Orleans food the way I like it. This is the real thing. Great atmosphere. Excellent service (shout out to Terranee). Food is top notch. The Shrimp n Grits easily made this one of my Top 3 stops in Memphis. It's 6 PM now and I'm going to try to make it back before they close for one more meal before I fly out tomorrow. The chef let me sample the etouffee and it was amazing.
