Coffeebar in Reno is a great place if you're looking for a drink, something to eat, catching up with someone, or getting some work done. Depending on the time of day, it can get quite crowded making it hard to find a place to sit. They do have outside seating. It's my favorite when the weather permits. The parking here isn't bad as there's typically plenty street parking. The service and drinks here are amazing and is one of the reasons I come back time after time. Your drinks are made quickly and the staff is always nice. Coffeebar is one of my favorite places to go. If you're looking for a place you can't go wrong with coming here!

It's a little expensive for snacks, but their coffee seemed to be a good price.My GF maple donut was very sweet, even though I love sweet and normally can tolerate quite high amount of sweetness. I bearly finished it, luckily the size wasn't too big. Plus, the texture was more like maple cake instead of a regular donut.The espresso caramel bar tasted very strong coffee flavor which my wife loves. The caramel wasn't too sweet and the bottom layer (looks like cheesecake crust) brought more texture to enhance the entire flavor. My wife enjoyed it a lot.The decor was modern and yuppie, lots of people were hanging out there with the computers or friends. Location wise was a little confusing, the entrance was at the corner but wasn't very clear from the parking lot. We went to the wrong entrance and ended up at a pizza place where it's right next to it. Service was nice and friendly."}, {"review_id": "JRP2GUwQ7kLhPmw3WvSQ1Q", "user_id": "1WgJN1I971Ddno30nQPBVQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Was out on an early morning walk and decided to pop into the Coffee Bar for the first time. Rating based on a quick coffee experience, I plan to come back another day for some grub or juice.Super mellow vibe when I came, but it was 8am on a Saturday after a healthy snowfall. The staff was helpful and quick. I got a 12oz mocha with almond milk for just under $6. It was super tasty! They have fresh pastries, juice and a nice menu of healthy eats to choose from. They also have some cool swag, if you're into it. I usually make espresso at home, but I will definitely come back to the Coffee Bar for java and eats."}, {"review_id": "mWuYYIonq2bP8meTPV44Iw", "user_id": "VBE9fERUHQ2Lh2MgpEzfIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Good place for coffee.

You can rev up your morning with an artisan coffee beverage,  and wind up your night with some wine!... then repeat. Coffee bar is tucked into a really cute neighborhood,  and if I lived in Reno, I would make sure to buy a house very close to this place. The food looks amazing, and the pastry case rivaled many other coffee shops I've been to. I was able to try a double short latte with almond milk. I settled for almond because they don't have soy, which I know is a controversial milk somehow, but hey whatever I like it. The scone I had was quite delicious, but a tiny bit dry if you ask me. Considering I was there at 9 a.m. only an hour after they opened, I would have hoped for a more moist scone. However, I could still get the flavors from it which were lemon and Thyme. A perfect combination of sweet and savory, Citrus and herbal. For sure I must stop, a little off the beaten path of the hotels, but worth it!"}, {"review_id": "slxr5r2cbJYrGNoN6Tdqdw", "user_id": "l2Nzahdw5fGnOlk5TKEYNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This place was booming at 6am.

This time around I had some out of town guests who wanted a nice coffee and a pastry. Since I try to take people to places that I know are a sure thing I immediately took them here. My father was happy to see that most of everything was locally sourced and the baristas knew what they were talking about when asked coffee questions, he is very picky about his coffee. He went with a Guatemalan blend and enjoyed it. He enjoys full bodied Colombian coffees and the Guatemalan was a very similar substitute. My sister enjoyed the fact that they serve alcohol as well as coffee and went with a Mimosa and a Raspberry & Chocolate Macaroon. She enjoyed both and they didn't skimp on the drink. My daughter had a cold brew coffee and a Paleo Pumpkin Bread. I couldn't get a picture of the Bread because she ate it so quickly lol. I ordered my tried and true Chai Late and Avocado Toast with the addition of a Poached Egg and Pea Shoots and Pumpkin Seeds. Both are just great. It's a great quick breakfast that will get you thru the morning and not make you feel bloated or tired. My only complaint is it's always busy and so I have to share a table but that's not Coffeebars fault, they are really good and should be busy. If you want a place you can work on your computer and enjoy a cup of coffee this is the place for you."}, {"review_id": "U3yhjG_9HYOo1i357EL2SQ", "user_id": "nBP1Q11Zf6dIGYTq_EdYxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "This place is so cute!I was always meaning to try this place out , but never really had the time to or thought of coming.But i'm glad I did. It's very college people orientated, and almost like the stereotypical movie date vibe .Prices are not bad at all and they have quite the selection for both drinks and food.But I will say the Matcha Tea I ordered was not the best Matcha, to be honest it was watered down and didnt have much taste to it or even a good amount of sweetness.But I mean... it was still refreshing.

My son and I are vegan and couldn't find many options for breakfast at other places other than the typical overpriced fruit cups. The lovely barista at the register offered us 3 yummy vegan muffin options, as well as 3 plant milks to choose from for my latte and son's cocoa (the chocolate syrup was vegan, according to the barista on bar). I chose a choco chip banana muffin for my son and a pumpkin apple muffin for me! My very picky little vegan boy loves them both! ;) My latte was delicious and the environment was relaxing and cozy despite it being a bit busy. It may not be completely vegan, but they had some great options for us!

It also seems that no two visits are ever exactly the same! It makes for a business that's never a bore, and when you visit coffee shops as often as I do, this is something worth seeking out!  The consistency boils down to the coffee they serve. It's a high grade specialty coffee, locally roasted, and thoughtfully prepared and served. They show respect and reverence for the coffee they serve, but at the same time, they want to insure each guest has the coffee experience they desire, and that everyone enjoys the beverage they've ordered. It's a solid philosophy that makes this place appeal to those of us that appreciate specialty coffee in its purest forms and those of us that want to enjoy a flavored latte or cappuccino. The change is on the menu, both food and beverage. They're adding new beverage options with the seasons, and adding new food items all the time! The case up front seems to always be expanding, and everything always looks so good! I don't know how I'm able to stop myself from ordering something on every visit! The kitchen is always bustling with activity and I love watching from the register and seeing all the great looking food make its way out to guests. The mere fact they have a full menu, and not just pastries, makes it great for those of us that tend to make these spots our offices for a day. Sandwiches, crepes, and salads are all delicious, and though they may seem on the pricey side, they use high quality ingredients that truly make the difference.It has been a few years since my last update, and I'm stoked to report a lot has remained the same. And while some things here have changed, it has all been for the best!  Keep on rocking Coffeebar!"}, {"review_id": "NJvxOHpAciiAkLjQqvM-6Q", "user_id": "7TBcjUjjnthRZrxOgSrtLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/3/2017", "text": "This is my favorite place for an iced mocha (only drink I've had here) and an almond croissant (made in-house).Coffeebar has a pretty extensive food menu, as well as, drink menu.

Lattes are consistently good and also unique. The lavender latte is one of a kind. It's one of the only places in Reno that serves straight matcha tea. The baristas here are always friendly.The layout is slightly awkward with no real waiting area. It does seem like you catch a lot of attention when you walk in due to an overly large crowd with wandering eyes. If you enjoy being on center stage then you'll love this. If not then just make sure you're on your game before stepping inside and embrace the stares. They have two outside patios both of which provide a nice escape from the crowd inside.The coffee is mediocre. It is not the best place to get an americano or cold brew. The flavor always seems flat and stale but still trumps restaurant coffee. Their bakery items do look lovely, but after trying a couple items the taste doesn't match the aesthetics. We haven't personally tried any of the kitchen dishes, but they always look appetizing and smell delicious so that's a plus."}, {"review_id": "0jhX6YaLp7b3tSN560D3BA", "user_id": "bgJLZAEaB04x9UQIm3sATQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Coffeebar serves up some of Reno's finest. The Coffee taste is fantastic, with expected bean options to drink and take home. Pastries such as the pumpkin donut hole and lemon bar are a great treat, and the Chai is a total winner.

Wine is available if a change of pace is in order and you prefer to wind down instead of amp up on caffeine. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available.

The place was pretty busy mostly with college students. It was a beautiful sunny day so we chose to sit outside in the back patio area. I ordered my favorite drink, the matcha latte & my friend ordered the latte. She got one free shot from the check in. I love the latte art, the lady ( Kim ) who made it, really did a good job. She didn't just make the art like the ordinary / usual heart art. We sat down outside and there were few of college students. Well they didn't bother much only one girl was so loud when she was talking with her friend. Well for the taste of their latte, my friend who's a coffee enthusiast told me that wasn't really the best one compare the little cute place coffee shop. My matcha latte was pretty good, the matcha flavor was quiet strong. Will I be back? Maybe not. I don't get the hype and mostly I don't like too much crowd or loud noise when I'm trying to enjoying my latte and have some nice conversation with my friend(s).
