The peach and barley salad is exceptional. Wonderful melange of textures, tastes and treats.Even better, the night's special was a pan seared mahi-mahi. Flawlessly executed, even the cracked pepper blossomed on my tongue!  Easily the best meal of the year for me. So good, I returned the next evening. It, too was a great meal. It was a different approach for the mahi, not quite as amazing, yet still superb. This space is elegant and understated, not too noisy. It's a restaurant to enjoy at every opportunity. I consider it the best in this region!"}, {"review_id": "L9Lc1n83Mdo9i9T3Yh5tew", "user_id": "95HZ7VfXMvZVTPv1UOnyaA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Delicious Date Night.We didn't make a reservation (be sure to call ahead as they are busy most weekends), so we sat at the bar. Was a little tight, but the food made it worth it. I had the Arctic char fish special while my boyfriend had the fried chicken. Both were cooked to perfection and paired amazingly with their respective sides. We also splurged by partaking in the dessert menu. The pretzels and popcorn ice cream was small in portion but big in flavor. As you can see we almost licked the bowl clean. The packed house took away from the service just a little, but our waiter remained chipper and personable. Definitely check this place out!"}, {"review_id": "loZus2V7_m_pH3Yh0bWHjQ", "user_id": "_fUNBHtf28v4kvvl18srkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "If you enjoy beautiful, thoughtful dishes, don't miss this lovely place. They have a small ala carte style menu with a little bit of everything, and it all sounds great. I wanted to try a few things, so I chose the creamed corn as sort of an appetizer, with the short rib and gnocchi entree, and I *thought* I was too full for dessert, but the waitstaff talked me into the popcorn ice cream. Everything was amazing. Part of the charm of this place was the staff's genuine enthusiasm for good food and their excitement for you to enjoy it. Not up-selling, but truly people who love food. The venue is quaint and modern, with seating at tables or the bar. Everyone was attentive and friendly. For the less foodie-types, they also bragged about their awesome cheeseburger."}, {"review_id": "YzuiL1VulLoBAn1vWSmWAg", "user_id": "0S3uwcyjt-g-N3WDvrPd0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "Definitely a go to for brunch. Got the shrimp and grits and an Irish pie, which had corned beef in puff pastry placed on top of delicious sausage gravy. I couldve licked my plate if this place didn't look so nice. The dishes were very satisfying and not at all greasy.

I was the first diner that early in the evening, and service was delightful and very friendly. I started off with the tea salad. It was crisp, light, and delicious. A nice start to the meal. For my entree, I was a bit stymied on what to order. I was hoping for something a bit lighter, but didn't see much on the menu. The single vegetarian dish included chickpeas, but I'm proud to say I'm chikpea-free. I was trying to decide between the roasted duck breast w/ rice pudding and braised short ribs w/ gnocchi. My server mentioned the ribs were a heavier dish, so I went with the duck. It was plump, juicy, and delicious with a schmear of tart cranberry. The rice pudding was good, but a bit overly rich. A nice pinot would have gone great lengths to cut the overall richness of the dish, but alas, I was stuck with sparkling water of my own accord. I would definitely recommend a stop here while in Billings."}, {"review_id": "gxX6STCUO3Jz7xJU2EiBkw", "user_id": "H2WhI7u2Zc-ozPnKBvhWwQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "Fine Dining in Billings MT?  Yes, it's true!  I would have given 5 stars, but the portions are relatively small for a hungry 6' 2\" male diner.All of the women in our dining group were satisfied."}, {"review_id": "npNWnkd0ZfPwq6vYwgqL1g", "user_id": "KOpxAFlxg16AXxERCx70dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/22/2017", "text": "How is lilac so good? The atmosphere just doesn't feel like you're in Billings. There is simply nothing like it. We got a cheese plate to start off with which was a great choice! The fig jam that goes with it is so fresh.

Asked if we could be moved, and we were told, \"Sorry - but we're booked solid we can't. The place was half empty and never filled to capacity, and people showed up with no reservations too (strike 1). Our waitress came over, seemed a bit spacey, recited the specials and took our drink order, and our food order of 2 apps and 2 entrees and then disappeared into the ether. I ordered the short ribs and gnocchi and the waitress said she'd have to check since she didn't know if they had sold out of the gnocchi. It was only 2 hours after they opened not the end of the evening; how much do they prepare each day?? The apps arrived 10 minutes later and we mentioned to the server that we still hadn't gotten our drinks. (Strike 2) He said he'd get them himself immediately, which he did. The herbed fries were excellent and the salad was very good, although a bit too sweet from all the apple, not enough acid to balance it. Our waitress reappeared and asked how things were, with no mention of why she never got our drinks, oh well. Entrees quickly arrive, swordfish special and the short ribs and gnocchi. Fairly small portions considering the $25 price for each. The swordfish was perfectly cooked and the side dish delicious. The short ribs were tender, juicy and unctuous but the gnocchi were small igneous rocks that had been cooked in a volcano. They were burnt on one side and dry and tasteless on the other. Where were the pillowy delights of my youth? Not here, where I slowly crushed my little ovals of granite at the peril of my dental health (strike 3). Waitress returns and says, Oh I'm sorry, I forgot to ask if you wanted any bread for the table. Uh, nevermind, we're almost done with dinner. Skipped the dessert. The kicker for the meal was when the adjoining table of 3 women ordered a bottle of wine and 3 glasses with our waitress. A server shows up with one glass of wine. One of the women says we ordered a bottle, and the server says, Oh, I was told you just wanted one glass, sorry. Not worth it at all."}, {"review_id": "-_NKaXAhFOCWiBVIhP-aQQ", "user_id": "ccuJziXYstN2FfnIZeBwTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2017", "text": "This was a real delight.

I didn't try the wine, as I don't like drinking before flying so this review is solely about the entree I ordered. I decided to try the braised short rib and was blown away by the flavor! The stew was rich with undertones of wine and onion. The gnocchi was amazing and the best I have ever had! It was evident they pan fried the gnocchi before putting it on the stew so it was crispy on the outside! Yum! The only thing I wish the dish had was more short rib, as it was sparse and it seemed the gnocchi was the star of the plate.My server was knowledgeable and attentitive, there is top knotch service here!"}, {"review_id": "ybhsefLPz6ZRxwq7cO_RPQ", "user_id": "_pGvYwEOwbEZ_4pJs9yBuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/29/2016", "text": "I have had the joy of eating in many, many great restaurants all over the country and in several cases outside the country. And if you are someone who really and truly enjoys food, you need to make Lilac a regular place to visit. The creativity and care that is put into every dish I have had the pleasure of tasting, is evident in each bite.  There are not enough places in this town and state willing to try to create wonder in food!!! Please please make the time to stop in and try this hidden wonder. Whether it is the incredible burger and fries with bacon jam, the incredible carrot matbucha, one of the amazing soups, or the delicious specials, Lilac is an adventure worth taking. It is not quite perfect, nothing in this world is. But it is remarkable and such a treasure to have in our small city. I can honestly say I have had meals here that rival anything to be found in New York, Seattle, Boston, or Chicago. Come and open your mind and palate and enjoy creativity, passion, and delicious food!!!"}, {"review_id": "DczkxZD3ijkZQmD7chOKAw", "user_id": "q749TIqmrGx8PBa7wupe8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/21/2016", "text": "Excellent food! Excellent service. If you can't decide on wine or beer don't fret because they have a bunch of different beers from the brewery across the street! We had the short ribs and the hummus with naan! We also got the coffee and donuts for dessert. Delicious with beautiful presentation. They also serve complimentary homemade bread. Expect to pay a bit more than your average Montana dinner place because this isn't an average place!

Small, casual place where the food and service are the real stars. Interesting menu here for great exploring. Our server, PJ did a wonderful job helping us with the menu and wine. He shared with us the mission for Lilac and local sourcing and the chef Jeremy really gets it right. We had the Montana steak tartar which was fantastic. The levels of flavor really popped (I especially liked the pickled celeriac with it). The tea salad was light and fresh and clean.   Beef short ribs and the halibut special were each good with these levels of flavors-amazing food.
