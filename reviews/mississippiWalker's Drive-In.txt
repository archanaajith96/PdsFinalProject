We were expecting burgers, fries and shakes and instead were treated to possibly one of the best casual upscale meals ever, and most certainly the best in Jackson.They provide high-end Southern dining with creative twists, all in a laid back and friendly atmosphere. Ok, maybe the latter is to be expected in Jackson but it was still a great experience in hospitality worth calling out.They are known for their steaks and the server was very knowledgeable about each cut, down to the marbling score. I definitely was not disappointed with my veal chop, it was cooked to perfection and everything else was just as exceptional.  We started with generous servings of the portobello mushroom fries in a spicy, creamy dipping sauce and a most savory pork belly with biscuits and jam. The moist, tender tamales were quite flavorful as well.  The desserts and wine/cocktail selection were not to be outdone either. My Malbec paired well with my steak, not buckling from the hearty cut.  We also enjoyed every bite of our brownie a la mode, simple but not lacking in any way. This has to be on your must try list if you're in Jackson, really special."}, {"review_id": "Fp5T6JDjpLc9t2f5K0uD-w", "user_id": "b9Q74D4XvFjJHKvLBLSaEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "OMG this place was fantastic! I can't stop raving about how amazing it was. From the unique interior to the delicious fresh fish and friendly service, this place easily demands a 5/5 rating. One of my favorite parts of the whole experience is that the place reminds me of an unassuming prohibition bar in NYC. From the outside it looks like a casual drive in restaurant from the 1950s. Once you walk in, you feel as if you should be ordering a vanilla milkshake at the bar or at one of the colorful booths that align the wall. We arrived on a Saturday evening and the place was packed. Thankfully I was warned that although it looks like a 1950s diner, it's really an upscale restaurant and people were dressed really well. We started off with two glasses of wine. They had a pretty legit 'wines by the glass menu', and most of the wines weren't terribly expensive. Then we ordered their portabella mushroom fries app, which was mushrooms lightly battered and fried in a delicious aioli sauce. It was fantastic, I loved the sauce. For dinner I ordered the miso marinated seabass which was outstanding. This is the second restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life that had forbidden black rice and it complemented the dish so well. The seabass was really fresh and just melted in my mouth and the red curry coconut broth gave the dish a nice flavor.  My date ordered the everything crusted #1 tuna, which I took a bite of and wow, this was some of the best tuna I have ever eaten! The fact that it said #1 sushi grade tuna, you knew this was going to be some high end tuna. The tuna came atop delicious cheese grits with tomatoes and chipotle glaze. Excellent flavor combination. Amazing spot, I would legit fly back to Jackson just to eat here!"}, {"review_id": "C7h7leZwVYxpwXT40nbNew", "user_id": "Okbtx8L4yaNq5wHJrAK6hw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Saw this restaurant on the food channel.

Mom said it's a 10!!! I had the meatloaf blue plate with mash potatoes, cabbage, and salad with comeback. My OCD almost went into overdrive when my salad was on the same plate lol but the comeback is wonderful. The cabbage is very good and the potatoes with meatloaf topping was good. The meatloaf has a sweet tomato paste-y taste that I didn't care for, but overall a great lunch. Will definitely come back to try other lunch plate specials. Richard was our server and he was fantastic. The Chef text me photos of him preparing the soft shell crab as we waited great lunch"}, {"review_id": "AX-PJGnOIbthKHkysPvLPg", "user_id": "Bjf5GdJdK8eXEYCy8yQCzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/2/2017", "text": "This place lives up to its hype. From the novel of a wine list to my most favorite fish dish of all time, the Redfish Anna there's nothing but praise for our meal here with out of town family. Our only recommendation is to get the steak sauce on the side. The steaks were so perfectly prepared and full of flavor on their own, and having poured the sauce all over that quality of steak would've masked the perfection of their steak preparation. However the sauce on the redfish was amazing and you should get every bite of it. They also accommodated my open table reservation and requests for a booth in the main room (highly recommend for the best atmosphere). We can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "ueCSywCT3VIWnb6bnTy0dA", "user_id": "ab3SYU2sI_mFTATWV0C6lA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "Jackson, you have an amazing restaurant on your hands here. Step back in time into this black and white Art Deco, yet still-hip-today dining room. It truly has a see-and-be-seen feel. I've dined here twice, both times visiting from Nashville, and I wish this restaurant was my city. Everything was exceptional, from the carpaccio special app, to their signature redfish Anna, to the amazing coconut curry sea bass, the snickerdoodle ice cream sandwich, and even their house salad. Wowzers! This place knows how to cook, plate, and provide excellent customer service. They're particularly talented when it comes to cooking fish. Absolute perfection.If you find yourself in Jackson and enjoy casual fine dining, this place is an absolute must!"}, {"review_id": "EqmNmomfPOyCLMX97rxLeA", "user_id": "qMMUBzhArKwN34VxlAqwHQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "So everyone raved about this place - stating it is probably the best spot in Jackson to eat. Well, it wasn't bad but definitely not the best in my opinion. I went here 3 times with co workers and I never got sucked into the hype of this place. The food was decent and a little overpriced for diner (once again - my opinion) the lunch specials were pretty damn good - but one thing we always noticed at lunch was that they are pretty greedy on the Iced tea refills. not too sure whats up with that but always have to ask for a refill and always sensed negativity when that request was made. So, in summary I would recommend for lunch - but not so much for dinner - Make sure yo make a reservation because 99% of the folks in the area will disagree with me on this review and they are extremely busy. I just don't see nothing special about this place. its OK - try it for your self and let me know your thoughts on it."}, {"review_id": "1TFpXSrtuW8VMDq1Sgx9iQ", "user_id": "kPgNVSxXnhkyWBkqTcW45g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/23/2016", "text": "What the, what? The curb appeal says casual (think po-boys and fries), but once you enter you get a 5-star steak vibe! How'd you do that?!I visited Walker's on a girl date with my mother-in-law as I'd had it bookmarked for some time and finally got my shot at a visit. Best decision ever! The Drive-in is a high end diner, if you will. I've heard that lunch it's truly casual, but Walker's definitely makes the upscale transformation at dinner! The place was packed-- thank God we were just a party of 2. They literally squeezed us in and the rest is history! The food is AMAZEBALLS and cooked to perfection! The portions are great and conducive to sharing. The pomegranate martinis are awesome also! The service is attentive, knowledgeable, and spot on in every way! Yes-- Walker's is pricey, but worth every penny! DEFINITELY one of Jackson's BEST, and a heavy contender for the #1 dinner spot on my list.

The main area is a little small, but they have expanded to another building in the same area. I always prefer to be seated there. It tends to seem more private and have a more, for lack of a better word, romantic atmosphere. The steaks are delicious. My wife says this is the only place that can cook them better than me (brushes off shoulder). While she tends to stick to the fillet, I try to be adventurous. I normally order something different every time (not that we can afford to eat here often). Just pick a fish at random, and rest assured it will be delicious. As for appetizers, I can not recommend the pork bellies enough. They are delicious, succulent and tender. Served in a verde sauce with a piece of the best cornbread since grandma. Not that it's anything like grandmas. It's very different, but also very delicious. If you're looking to splurge on some gourmet food but feel limited on your options....because...you know...it's Jackson, MS, this is the place to do it!"}, {"review_id": "GqYwl93kJBR2uxiCt-m7yA", "user_id": "MXfq1rErM16VtlSFWJoBjQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "My go - to spot for risotto.

The Walker's diner sign is the first thing you notice when you pass by the restaurant. It has continued to be a stable place in the ever-changing Fondren area.
