I'll admit I kept putting it off because of where it was located and what the outside looked form the pictures. I wasn't sure exactly what I was going to find!!I was pleasantly surprised and wished I would have come to check this place out sooner!!! Cute, quaint, cozy....... definitely words I would use to describe this little place and I agree with another reviewer that called it kinda like a ski resort style of a breakfast place. Definitely not fancy-- but I wasn't too deterred by that as the food was excellent!!! I had a breakfast bagel- egg with sausage and cheddar cheese on an egg bagel (I was in the mood for breakfast food-- but I will definitely be back to try their lunch bagels as I think those would probably be even better as there was more in them. ) and my husband got the egg and ham on a jalapeño bagel. And we also got a cranberry muffin which was HUGE!!Both sandwiches were excellent. PIPING HOT!!! Next time I will let mine cool for awhile as I ended up burning the top of my mouth. But that was my own fault!!! And the muffin was so fluffy. It reminded me of angel food cake! The coffee was nice and hot and I liked that there were free refills of any kind of coffee! They had a nice selection of breakfast roast, dark roast, a pecan and a hazelnut roast which I thought was really different. I did have to mark them down one star as I wasn't too impressed with the cleanliness. I get that it's an older building-- but it would have been a five star review for me if it hadn't have been for the cobwebs and layer of dust over everything. All in all, I might still order some bagels and cream cheese to go next time!!!"}, {"review_id": "u34aFp69sB9EgPfFCt5VdQ", "user_id": "17kCwheyjZVDjDmUMxGivg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Quaint little place right in the heart of downtown Aurora. I used to stop in here a lot when I worked nearby. It was great for breakfast, coffee, and a semi-quick lunch with coworkers.I LOVE flavored coffee. Not coffee with flavored syrup - and this place delivers! They usually have 6ish different coffee choices including several flavors. My favs include blueberry and coconut island. Depending on the day or week, the flavors change.They make their cream cheeses in house and always have a special going on. Go in and ask for some samples before you choose.They have tons of bagels to choose from. Have it plain, with cream cheese, make a breakfast sandwich out of it, or a lunch sandwich and choose the deli meat you want on it.The double sided fireplace makes Jake's extra cozy when is is -4* outside. I just want to sit near the fire with my coffee and a good book. Bonus tip: The artwork on the walls is for sale. They offer work from local artists."}, {"review_id": "gvPTFqSYlK9k2X7kIcWRXQ", "user_id": "aQHljVY9_SsdzWDa9TvdTg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "The bagels here were at best, just ok.

I wish they had Lox but otherwise I can't complain. Homemade bagels and fresh, delicious cream cheeses (my favorite is pineapple walnut - with big chunks of fresh pineapple) and a great cup of coffee. Their coffee is generously sized as well - 16 oz. for a small and 24 oz. for a large. I love this because I'm a girl who NEEDS her coffee! I usually stop in after my Saturday morning workout and the service is fast and friendly. The restaurant itself could benefit from updated decor but the place is cozy and the new windows on the east wall make the dining space feel a lot larger than before."}, {"review_id": "ayXPr_X-r7seszRH7G9uvQ", "user_id": "tnBQvH_Q6TLFwbatUEKVIA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/26/2016", "text": "Had lox bagel and small soup.

As a supporter of small, family, and local businesses, Jake's bagel and deli hit the jackpot on all levels! To start, the friendly customer service made you feel at home. And when I brought my daughter into the restaurant, they treated her as if she was their own grandchild. Now onto the food, the food or should I say their bagels were some of the best tasting bagels I have ever had. The Jake's bagel was so yummy that cream cheese was not needed. All the cream cheese did was put the bagels quality over the edge in a good way. What impressed me the most is every single items that you purchase is made in house. You will never get that from a Panera or any large corporation. Jake's bagel and deli is a must visit if you are in downtown Aurora. I would rather drive 10 minutes to this location then go to any Panera that's closer to me. Thank you for your hospitality and I look forward to your service in the future."}, {"review_id": "vFD0HKy1c1YEBQY00inLhA", "user_id": "mRj01KDqXwHuqMxu-bec4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2016", "text": "This place is great!  If you were looking for a nice family owned breakfast stop with great coffee, delicious food, and friendly staff then Jakes is your destination!       The owners are Aurora locals, and the location is great!  Right on the river with excellent outdoor seating!  The options here are great as well!  All the cream cheeses are homemade, and the bagels are fresh every morning.  There are no food substitutes or additives.  If you order the apple cinnamon cream cheese, there are actually chunks of apple in it!!!  If you're looking for something more substantial, try one of their breakfast sandwiches.  But be warned, they are huge, and they come out steaming hot!"}, {"review_id": "BodUz5J31WgPZXL5LrzTVQ", "user_id": "3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2016", "text": "The inside of Jake's is like a cozy little ski lodge or cabin, and you wouldn't know it cruising down Broadway.  There's also plenty of seating outside, right on the river!  The location is especially convenient for those commuting from the Aurora Metra or anyone who works in downtown Aurora.  The building really blends into the surroundings with a tiny sign and windowless building - it's so much better inside, I promise.I stopped in during lunch time on my day off.  It was pretty busy, but when a place closes early, isn't it always the lunch rush?  My only gripe with Jake's is their hours.  They close at 3pm, which means I can only go on a weekend or on a day off.There's almost an endless amount of options for bagels and cream cheese, my next stop is either going to be chocolate chip or jalapeno cream cheese.  But not both.I got a Lox bagel sandwich here.  I'll admit, I like the Lox sandwich at Schmaltz just a little bit more, but the bagel (poppyseed) was great.  The ladies working here are nice and give you plenty of options (what kind of bagel? cream cheese? okay, toasted or not?).  Prices are about what you'd expect and certainly reasonable for a good lunch.This may have been my first visit, but it certainly won't be my last."}, {"review_id": "CE19KMsZrGA_HqQUo01Hdg", "user_id": "yVhfURr-941vjbK13YyGdQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2016", "text": "I want a Jake's bagel right now, but alas no bagels via US postal service.

They are ubiquitous in every deli, and independent bagel shops are just about in every neighborhood. Unfortunately, the most we in the Midwest get is Panera, Einstein, and the \"barely\" a bagel Dunkin Donuts dough bomb. This morning brought me a delightful delivery from Jake's Bagels. A coworker brought bags of the pillowy, chewy goodness. I already ate breakfast, but just looking at the steam in the bag made me give in to temptation. I started with half a salt bagel with veggie cream cheese. It was like a morning pretzel made better for me (in my dreams) with pieces of fresh chopped veggies. So killer! I knocked off a bunch of salt though since it was a little much for me. Not to be a pig, I gave myself another hour before getting to bagel dessert. I had to try the cherry vanilla cream cheese on a blueberry bagel. Or at least I think it was blueberry. It was a purple hue and had tiny dark blue specks in it. A lot of mass produced doughs (like DD) actually use blueberry flavored cranberry pieces, I'm not sure if that's the case with Jake's. I'd like to believe the pieces were so small because they're real blueberries. I covered it with cherry vanilla cream cheese. I would put that on a plain bagel next time though as the flavor muted the bagel itself. Do you see those whole maraschino cherries?? We had a green olive cream cheese this morning too, but I only gave it a small taste. It's really packed with that briny flavor you love or hate. Loved my second breakfast today. Hats off to Jake for giving NY bagels a run for their money!"}, {"review_id": "ncYNHfmvsZrESPxajXRQxA", "user_id": "gGZTkAm0pZluFCz_Uv0R0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2016", "text": "While in the burbs, stop by at Jake's Bagels in Aurora. Located across the street from the Aurora Transportation Center, this place has some of the most amazing bagels in the burbs (perhaps all of Illinois). They have 16-17 variations of bagels which whether served as-is, warmed up, toasted, filled with one of their homemade cream cheeses, or as a sandwich, will leave you feeling fantastic. They have many styles of coffee from a balanced Breakfast Blend to dark roasts and flavored varieties which are totally customizable with various syrups and flavorings. My go-to is a Plain Salt bagel, toasted or warmed up, with chunky chocolate chip cream cheese and black coffee.Delicious!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/jakes-bagels-and-deli-aurora?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
