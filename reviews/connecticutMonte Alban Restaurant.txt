If you order a soft drink there are no refills. $2.50 per drink. I ordered a quesadilla and adding chicken to it was $11. Almost as expensive as a regular entree. So here's the kicker. I ordered chips and salsa. Most Mexican restaurants bring chips and salsa out to the table automatically. The server never said that the quesadilla is considered an appetizer and adding chips and salsa is $5.00. The chips came out and they were stale. I should have sent them back but I never bothered because I thought they would end up on the bill. I had a couple chips and that was it. At the end of the meal I asked the server if we could split the bill. She let out a big \"I'm annoyed\" sigh and walked away. I told her never mind and I'd put it all on my card. She brings the bill and there's a $2.50 charge for my drink. A $2.50 charge for my refill. A $5.00 charge for chips and salsa. A $1.00 charge for sour cream. Granted, there is usually a small charge for sour cream. Overall, I was annoyed. I think $5.00 for chips and salsa is steep. And how about letting us know that there's a charge for chips and salsa at the outset. Better yet, just bring out the chips and salsa for free no matter what you order. Their food is good but not great.  I'll take my business elsewhere."}, {"review_id": "xjutm3dZTk2dD2ft5mPYsQ", "user_id": "cVrM2BvOvPV0Vi_rC8kepQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2016", "text": "We made our first visit to Monte Alban tonight and left pretty impressed. As so many have stated, you'll probably whiff on scoring a parking spot on the street, but there are quite a few spots in the back of the Tangiers parking lot across the street.When you walk in, you notice that the interior is quite pretty, with painted stucco in shades of gold, orange, yellow, green and red with accents of painted bricks and Mexican tiles.The service was great- a super nice mamacita that looked us in the eyes and warmly spoke to us and asked us what we wanted, and if we needed anything else. No phony-baloney smiles here, it was all genuine.Speaking of genuine, as someone who has had more than his share of the Moe's/Q'doba/Chipotle style of Mexican food, I was very impressed with the real deal menu and my dinner.We started off with chips and guacamole- a big portion of guacamole. It cost $8 and was a pretty great value.My entrée was Camarones a la Diablo ($16) - a beauty of a plate with seven shrimp, a scoop of rice, an incredible spicy sauce and a fresh garden salad with avocado slices. I like spicy, and this dish was perfect for me, lots of flavor, lots of zip, but not too much. Honestly, this was one of the best meals I've had in a while.We also ordered a Grilled Chicken Taco Salad ($14) - a big portion that wasn't skimpy on the chicken at all.Bottom line? We had a very enjoyable time here, the food was great, and price vs. quality vs. portion size equaled a very good value."}, {"review_id": "2nR6WoMnk3qpI4fowsDFYw", "user_id": "dpBbkopbdFXy5PIFluPcmg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/5/2017", "text": "I really wanted to like this place. And maybe I caught it on a bad night, I don't know, but my experience was pretty terrible.  After about 15 minutes, my wife and I were seated and ordered from a waitress that was both rude and dismissive simultaneously. She brought out stale chips w salsa and when we mentioned they were stale, she said, \"no, that's just how they are.\" So I said,\" try one.\" She wouldn't. No questions, no apologies, nothing. She took the chips away and 40 minutes later our food came out. Nothing in between. We had to ask 3 different people for water. The food portions were on the small side and just not very good. Any Mexican restaurant charging 45 bucks for some tamales, a chimichanga and 2 watered down margaritas better be worth its weight. This one isn't.

My honey and I proceeded to order tacos and fajita's, respectively.  My fajitas were amazing...deeeelicious.  Honey was not impressed with his tacos.I asked for some hot sauce and was provided with a side of very hot salsa (and delicious).  Unfortunately, I was charged $4 with no warning at all and it couldn't have been more than 1-2 ounces of salsa. The restaurant is cute and cozy.  Service was fair although our waitress seemed to become more and more irritable as more and more people came into the establishment. Besides that, though, service was okay. Street parking was readily available and there is a parking lot not too far away according to restaurant signs.  All and all, I would absolutely go again.  Maybe I'll bring my own hot sauce next time. :)"}, {"review_id": "yXDqrh2vzpenHtC83GGMww", "user_id": "ySfth0a2qvwPbqXHw0yrFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2016", "text": "Add another restaurant to my sad \"Why Have I Not Been Here Sooner\" list.

On Monday - Friday, 10am-3pm you have about 20 or so items that are priced at $10. Every plate is served with rice, beans and corn cake (think of a sweeter corn bread) I think their tacos are the best thing on the menu, but they only give you one for lunch. So if you're looking for something more filling, the best bang for your buck during lunch has to be the meat or veggie burrito.I would like to try more of their house specialties during dinner, but I always go for the Oaxaquena Combo (two enchiladas) The fajitas are really popular too. If you just don't know what to get -- try the guac, its bomb! And also tacos, definitely the tacos!

I've been here a handful of times and have always enjoyed my meal. Today I ordered a veggie burrito which, inexplicably, came with a side of refried beans and a house salad (with tomatoes, onions, and huge radishes; whereas everyone else who ordered a burrito got beans and rice on the side). It was delicious and only $9. Our waitress patiently put up with our complete mangling of Spanish words or phrases like \"agua\", \"por favor\", and \"enchiladas con carne\". She was very accommodating and served our food very quickly.We had a huge group, which (barely) fit in the little party section up near the front window, and even though we didn't call ahead, we didn't get any complaints or eye rolls. Check plus, Monte. There was a good lunch crowd, too. It's \"bean\" a few hours and no one in my group has had any complaints, so I am thinking this is a safe place to eat."}, {"review_id": "9_r4qUdkmzNGi0J_Ifvjzg", "user_id": "H-nGuikamajle99CN36HYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/2/2017", "text": "This place has great service and great food.
