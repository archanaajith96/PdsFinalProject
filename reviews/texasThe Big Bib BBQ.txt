Chicago-style BBQ utilizes these scraps into rib tips. When done right, they are like the \"burnt ends\" of a brisket. The Big Bib BBQ does them just right. They were smoky, tender, and juicy. One of the best I've ever had! Rating: 5/5 Baby Back Ribs were perfectly cooked, competition-style. The meat comes of the bone, not quite fall off the bone, which would be overcooked. It had a great rub for full flavor along with the smoke. I could eat a slab of those with no problem. Rating: 5/5Brisket is made with certified Angus Beef. This brisket was one of the best cooked I've ever seen in a restaurant. Normally in restaurants and in competitions, I find that brisket is either under cooked or way over cooked. It should be sturdy enough to slice and not fall apart. When sliced, it can relax over the finger without snapping in half or be straight as a board. I also love when the fat cap is left on the brisket, which a lot of KCBS judges do not like. I personally think it helps to keep the brisket juicy and adds more flavor as it cooks. That said, this brisket checked all the boxes for me. I could eat a pound of this all by myself. I just love brisket and when it's cooked like this, I love it even more. Rating: 5/5Mild Sausage is hardwood smoked and crafted. Their sausage was a medium grind sausage with a good flavor of pork, smoke, and spices. I liked it sliced but also thought it would be great just inside a bun (like a hot dog) or sliced up in a sandwich. The casing had a nice snap to it which would make it perfect inside a bun. Rating: 5/5Jalapeno Sausage is a stable in Texas BBQ. It was a medium grind sausage that was just a tad spicy, not uncomfortable. It was juicy and had a good flavor. This would be great in a sandwich or in a bun with melted cheddar cheese. Rating: 4.8/5Turkey Breast is smoked all day until melt-in-your-mouth tender. This was one of the best smoked turkeys I've ever had. Juicy and tender yet still easily sliceable. I could eat this as is or stacked inside a sandwich with melted cheese on top. Rating: 5/5Baked Potato Casserole tasted exactly like a loaded baked potato. It was creamy from the butter and sour cream along with the flavor of cheese and smoky, salty bacon. Sweet Potato Casserole was thick and has the aroma of sweet potatoes. It was almost like eating sweet potato pie! Rating: 5/5Chili Beans is not just beans but more like a meaty chili. Unlike the sweet barbeque beans in California, theirs were savorier and hearty like chili with chunks of meat. You could just have a side of chili beans and bread for lunch. Rating: 5/5"}, {"review_id": "Car8ay54Qy2JpxnmMNYEAw", "user_id": "XoxFYCKuUfhJOPin73MtVw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Tried to stop in and eat here tonight. It was about 7:10p. They close at 8p. Yet we couldn't order french fries as a side because they close their kitchen an hour before they close for the night. Bottom line...be ready to get whatever they have left over if you want to eat there in the last hour they're open. They won't make what they have on the menu. Not sure we'll make the trip down there again. I appreciate the response, Stanley. We decided to cut our losses and went elsewhere for our dinner that night.

I normally have the marbled brisket, which truly melts in your mouth. We all have heard that trite term before, but here it is not a big chunk of fat with some brisket. It is truly marbled. I also had the baby back ribs and they have an awesome dry rub, with any one of 4 house sauces to compliment any of your BBQ choices. When I was all done they even gave my mother-in-law and I a free piece of brisket after cause I was picking off of my wife's plate. They offer a military rate while in uniform as well."}, {"review_id": "6QA3yT9fA78SsR5mYRqH-w", "user_id": "HmLgwhnhK6m7ewnCrkCoCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Nevermind the check in.

The loaded brisket baked potato is maybe the best thing I've eaten at a BBQ joint ever. It's a good thing it wasn't giant, because I would've kept eating it forever and ever. We also got the meat sampler. The turkey was so incredibly moist (terrible word, but perfectly cooked bird) and well seasoned. I want to try and replicate it in our smoker. We also really enjoyed the sausage. It had fresh herbs, jalapeños and bits of cheese in it. Very good. Great service experience as well. Everyone was friendly and helpful. This place would be a perfect ten if it sold beer and had a couple sweet items to finish off a meal - something simple here would be fine.

The food was good but their decor needed some updating. Super awesome staff! Very attentive. There was this guy there watching over the place and making sure everyone had what they needed. Loved all their bbq sauces! Wasn't a big fan of the baked potato casserole but the chili beans were yummy! Gotta try the peach cobbler. The owners wife makes it herself.

One of the staff was just greeting people, asks how they're doing, welcomes everyone who comes in, makes small talks, etc. and the staff behind the counter tries to explain to you their menu, gives recommendations and are very patient. It was our first time and we weren't sure what to get. So we ended up getting a plate with rib tips and ribs and coleslaw and potato salad. Theeen ended up getting half a pound brisket after finished our plate. It was that good or we're just really hungry. Btw, the combo plate comes with 2 slices of bread. The friendly guy who was greeting us made us try the sweet potato casserole. I ended up eating most of it because it was delicious.  They're all delicious. Even their sauces are good. I cant choose which ones my favorite because all the flavors were good. The spicy one isn't that spicy (for me at least). Service was pretty fast and parking wasn't bad. It wasn't busy when we visited on a weekday around 1pm. paper towels and sauces are available on the table. I'd recommend checking this place out if you're in San Antonio."}, {"review_id": "ZN822mmTIM0j5wIHTBmSAA", "user_id": "JzLWROnwpIygyXTgpyPTDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I had a fantastic experience here!

And for dessert  (aside from the banana pudding, which was very light) we got a sweet potato casserole. Everything was just so good. I would totally go there again, multiple times over.

That's. great attention to detail to always have your customers feel welcome. We ordered the sampler so we can try all the different meats. The sides of green beans, chili, and potato casserole did not disappoint. The potato casserole was probably my favorite side with its the cheese integrated in it. The plates come with slices of toast and some fresh red onions and pickles. Each table has their own bottles of BBQ sauce. Personally my favorite was the hot sauce to give it some nice kick to the meat. The sampler plate is definitely big enough that you can feed 2-3 people and still be very satisfied. BBQ itself was moist Visiting here from California, a member of the staff was so helpful as to give us some tips in traveling around San Antonio.

I also got the rib tips and they were decent but I liked the brisket a lot! I should have got the sausage or the full bone in ribs. Rib tips are not good. Now the sides are amazing! I had baked potato casserole and potato salad. Both were really good. They have quite the selection of bbq sauces. Also, the owner is on the floor greeting people and making sure everyone is taken care of. I come to San Antonio quite a bit for Work and definitely put this on my list of places to eat in San Antonio. Great job big bib! Also the walls are full of their awards and write up.

Bib has ample space for indoor and outdoor dining (with a large secondary space - presumably for larger parties). The restaurant itself was clean and the staff was extremely friendly.I dined as a party of four and we tasted the ribs, brisket, jalapeño sausage, beans and sweet potato casserole. The brisket was phenomenal, the rest, however, was unimpressive. For a family-style barbecue joint, the portions were surprisingly small - but fairly priced. Perhaps most disappointing was the lack of variety in sauces available - 4 house sauces were the only visible options to choose from albeit tasty ones (the tangy gold and hot and spicy in particular). One of my big check marks on a  checklist for a spectacular barbecue restaurant is exciting rubs, spices, and sauces, and i couldn't check that box here.In general, i would likely return to Bibs if i found myself in that area, but I am Still looking for that 4 or 5 star barbecue experience down here - hopefully Rudy's fits the bill!"}, {"review_id": "pL3MZsbRYWks-2zNQwR2lw", "user_id": "WOOhS3yC2dEjOkBCTXaLdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "A coworker suggested we get Big Bibb for our team lunch. They are located on the other side of the city from us, so we called in a big order and took a couple meetings on the road. When we arrived, the restaurant was a bustle of activity, many people in business casual attire stopping in for lunch. They had our 10 person order ready to go and the service both in person and on the phone was great. The restaurant itself looks very woodsy, complete with outdoor dining, it has a BBQ shack feel to it. We got some of everything, chicken, brisket, pork, sausage, collards, rib tips, sweet potato, slaw, etc. Everything was good. Nothing went to waste and there was almost no leftovers. The meats were juicy and tender, even after being in a take-out aluminum tray form 30 min prior to getting back to the office. All sauces were on the side, which allowed the flavors of the smoke and the meats themselves to shine through. The rib tips were a tad fattier than I imagined, but the sausage had a wonderful texture, and the brisket was well-trimmed (we ordered lean).
