The buffet really could be bigger but that's because everything is so great. Ordering off the menu is stellar as well. Always consistent and very good.

SERVED **CHICKEN** AS VEGETARIAN DISH!!!!I'm a pure vegetarian by religion and by choice. I went to their lunch buffet on 11/12/17 along with my wife. This was our first visit ever since we were driving over from New Orleans to Atlanta and thought to have some good Indian food. On their buffet table, they had put \"aloo chilly\" to a dish tag so both of us put some on our plate. But as we started eating, something didn't feel well and as we took stuff out from our mouth, we were shocked to see that what we were eating was CHICKEN!! When we went upto the counter to complaint, the server very casually said \"OH, I FORGOT TO CHANGE\". After we pressed her hard that it's a horrible mistake, only after that she apologized but was still defensive. When we asked for the manager Salaam Singh, she disappeared into the kitchen and didn't come out until after 5 mins after she saw a new customer walking in. They didn't quite understand how they hurt my religious sentiments!!Of course, this was just any other pit stop for us and won't be coming here again, but this experience has left a big scar and taught us a big lesson of being careful in future. Hopefully, management takes a big lesson going forward."}, {"review_id": "TlK3wfkqU5l8hE2b3eNIhA", "user_id": "TLRlAcSlpKkhGvP2nq7w6A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Yuck. Don't do it. I'm so grossed out right now. We tried the lunch buffet and it was not good. The okra was overgrown and like chewing on sticks. I can't remember the last time I actually had to spit out food. The flavour of the potatoes was okay, but some of the potatoes were undercooked. I've eaten food in Nepal and never had anything like the food here. I don't want to be rude, because maybe the people running this place are trying really hard, but the food here was really terrible."}, {"review_id": "xbkuXnRbz-zsoK6YhhAk-A", "user_id": "iH3y58KYrfRj-Hp0IsEglA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "For  restaurant with 2 locations, I have found the food to be consistent regardless of where we dined.

The only dish that was close to what we have ordered in the past ...was the chicken Mo Mo but it had no sauce. The chicken tika masala was watery.

Our food took a solid 50 minutes to reach our table, and even though we specifically ordered our food \"as hot as possible\" it turned out mild at best. The servers were not attentive, and the quality of the food was subpar; it felt as though they had watered down the meal, and the spices were barely present. In addition, the entire meal cost about $45 after tip. Granted we also got garlic naan (which was good) and an appetizer. I would not recommend this place to a friend."}, {"review_id": "1P_97LZHSU9Z9Xy1uGD1Og", "user_id": "pF6L6UBs8XMcQN28ZxBNXg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "This is my second visit here.

Large menu to choose from, catering to meat lovers and vegans. Can't go wrong with any of the curries or tandoor entrees. If you're just starting out with this cuisine, stay away from the Gundruk until your taste palette develops. I recommend the Momos to start off on Nepalese side. They are very similar to potstickers. For the Indian menu, Butter Chicken or Chicken Tikka Masala would be a great beginners choice. Vindaloo would be the next step. It's vinegar based and a bit fiery.  To accompany your entree, I recommend a side of naan. They have a variety of different flavors with the bullet naan being my favorite. They have a buffet at lunch if you'd like to sample different items. The spice level is usually mild to accommodate a wider base of diners."}, {"review_id": "-dYJRv5P5guQD3ptbWViCw", "user_id": "6dyzPWOYEsuzXrhEh7o1Ng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "I absolutely love this place.

We decided to have an early dinner here on our way to Florida. The restaurant is housed in a shopping strip, but that didn't deter me from wanting to try them out. There was two other parties here so we had free range to sit wherever we wished. The younger gentleman was out server and he was very friendly. The older lady also came by several times to check in on us. I ordered the  Nepalese Veg Thali and my company ordered the Chicken Vindaloo. It took a while or our food to come out and it was quite chilly inside. When the lady brought our food out I really appreciated the presentation she gave me in great detail about what each dish was on my platter and I liked the attention to detail she gave. They brought out regular white Naan but after we mentioned we ordered whole wheat they brought us a fresh basket out. The bread was not buttered or anything so it was a little dry, but still served the purpose. I noticed the Vindaloo was in a kind of small bowl. My platter was presented beautifully and it was my first time having Nepalese food. My chicken curry was good. It came with mustard greens those weren't nothing to write home about. I also didn't care for one of the dishes because it had a fermented veggie in it that threw me off. The other veggie dish was okay. It also came with some sort of sweet coconut pudding. The decor inside is pretty nice they have Buddhist art and statues and Buddha prayer flags. I'd like to try lunch buffet if I dine here again."}, {"review_id": "Si-vzWlnnJFK9CdzOFyTdQ", "user_id": "qIvJS2X_CkgNR5DyBQJ_aA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Decent buffet to go and try different offerings for this style of food. If you are not used to Indian fare a buffet is your best choice so you don't get scared off because it's new and unknown. The spice level is about medium so you will not be punished to badly if you choose wrong. The dining room is large and not cramped, and the buffet itself was clean and well maintained throughout the time period we were there.
