Very unassuming family owned restaurant that serve surprisingly delicious Thai food in the middle of rural America. Food is one of the best Thai restaurants I've had anywhere, and believe me I had a lot of Thai food, even in native Thailand. Please do come by and get the food here, you won't be disappointed. I will probably stop by again if I ever got a chance to come through Billings, MT"}, {"review_id": "WS1ILjM2b4EnJQPUyfGROA", "user_id": "1wE7oHKgNOLPM0QWS3jm9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/24/2017", "text": "I needed Montana for my 50 states Pho challenge, so I was here at Imperial Thai Asian fusion restaurant in Billings on a easy casual Monday afternoon. Or so, I thought.You know Travel Channel's Man Versus Food? This adventure seemed like that was the case, but without the cameras and the hype that surrounded the television show. It was just me and the big ass bowl of Pho. I knew what I wanted, but I didn't know that the imperial version was 16-18 inches versus the smaller non intense version that most people usually have. I guess that's how it is. The imperial version was around $14.50. While it was pretty ginormous in nature, the server informed me that it was a good challenge that would be pretty epic if I had finished it. The typical reward was a photograph of yourself on the website acknowledging that you have completed the challenge. While in my head, a complimentary lunch was out of the question, I thought a photo of me would be second best. Unfortunately, I underestimated this bowl of pho and ended up not finishing it, despite having the shiracha sauce already mixed in the broth. The photo I took of it does not do it any justice. You just have to be here in person to see and witness such monstrosity. You know it was pretty epic. While it was nice to eat that large bowl of Pho, it was too large for my own good. The overall experience here at the imperial Thai Asian fusion restaurant was pretty good and mellow. At around 1:30pm on a typical Monday, the restaurant itself was somewhat empty, but it had a few tables occupied already. It was nice to get a table right away and that was very much appreciated. The restaurant itself was clean and the decor was pretty nice as well. It was pretty large for a Vietnamese restaurant, but I forgot that this is an Asian fusion restaurant, plus they have a lunch or dinner buffet too, but I ordered off the menu for my pho. I think I spent a good 45 minutes here, trying to take down this ginormous bowl of pho. At the end of the day, the bowl of Pho won and I just had to give up and pay for the meal. Even if I had won, I'd still have to pay for it. The prize was a photo of me on their website, saying I completed the challenge. Imperial Thai Asian fusion restaurant is located at 216 N Broadway Street in beautiful Billings.They accept major credit cards, so that's always a good deal for me, especially when I am touristing around. Parking here can be a grind, but there are several parking options you can have, but they all require money. For me, I found a parking lot that is $1 for the first hour on 3rd avenue, if I remember correctly. There are a couple public parking garages though, but they require money. Not sure if Billings public transportation comes through this area of town, but to be sure, check their website online and come on over! The prices here are pretty good and consistent with other similar restaurants I've been through the USA. As I write this review, I wondered what was offered for the lunch buffet. Too bad I had the pho this time, but I'll try my best to return and do the other instead! I did enjoy the experience here at imperial Thai Asian fusion restaurant and hope to come again soon. I would like to recommend this place, if you are in the area and love the cuisines presented here.4.0 stars for the overall experience. 4.0 stars for the Pho, although I wished it was a little cheaper and less spicy, so I could have finished it and won. 4.0 stars for the service. It was nice and friendly.Support localB"}, {"review_id": "CcZ5zvlRX2fYvb37GUKoQg", "user_id": "hMh1kx69INFk7bEj9D-JAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2017", "text": "Flavor and price is really good here. I went with egg fried rice and edamame and meal was under $15 with tip. Would have leftovers too if I had a fridge in my hotel room. Seriously, very good fried rice. I really enjoyed the flavor. I do wish they had some condiments on the table though like siracha or soy sauce. Maybe I didn't need them, but nice to have the option. I read some other reviews about good spice options for some of the more traditional Thai dishes and I really wish they would add that as an option to their fried rice. The edamame was good. Found it interesting that the salt was on the side. I prefer it already part of the dish, but at least their was salt. The space itself was different. Very open, and I'm curious to see how the buffet is set up. I don't feel they use the space very wisely, but I think they are still starting out. Maybe if it  gets popular they will add some more tables and use the space a bit better. I'll be back for sure if I'm craving Thai food while in town."}, {"review_id": "bLcNERHcXtv5B7K3eHjy6g", "user_id": "ouDR5CnFknY-CTTlHtz5gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "This is for a take-out order: Exceptional spices and taste. Authentic Thai selections. The vegetables are not frozen and the noodles are homemade. Upon walking in it appears to be a mostly take-out place. There were people sitting down but the dining room is small. The counter and register are in the back of the narrow seating area so if you get take out you have to maneuver around people sitting at their tables, then walk back through with your bags of food. I can see how this would be very distracting for someone eating in. Definitely casual dining-in. The register was run by young teens, it looked like the parents weren't the kitchen- so definitely a family owned place. Will come again, but likely only for take-out."}, {"review_id": "x-ZWkCcQ0SoUit9zD_8Jkg", "user_id": "3TVkJ7yFUEL63hrpFHJpMg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Excellent food!!!

We've only discovered this place about a month ago and have already gone four times because we can't get enough. Their curries are phenomenal and the most authentic that I've found in the United States after traveling to Thailand. I would highly recommend the Panang curry or the yellow curry but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu from what I've tried so far. You customize how spicy you want everything from 1-10 which is a great option if you have kids or anyone who can't handle heat. The portions are also huge especially for the curries and are easily two or three meals, even for my boyfriend who can eat a lot. I also think it's a family run business with the two high school kids working most times when I've gone in so it's great to support their local business! I recommend this restaurant to everyone and plan to take anyone who visits us in Billings here. Favorite restaurant by far!"}, {"review_id": "HEy7wI5ovUQO5WA399SWOQ", "user_id": "B4U5XujfxBmlWrGJHWD8FQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/12/2017", "text": "After checking into our hotel (Super 8 in Billings) we didn't hold out much hope..
