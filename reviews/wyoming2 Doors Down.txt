We were greeted by this nice little lady that explains how the ordering works. I ordered the mushroom Swiss with onion rings. The lady behind the counter explained if you order steak fries they are bottomless. I opted for the rings. During our meal different employees came to the table asking if we needed anything. The staff was awesome. On point. The food was just as great. The hamburger was super juicy. Â If your in the area stop by. You will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "_10n1hgS-sMH5CRnf77oCg", "user_id": "mwQCoS_tJUK7JC6cVw_mdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/19/2017", "text": "Great burger. Cooked perfectly and bottomless fries. Service is fast and accurate. The burger maybe had a little too much mayo, but luckily I like Mayo. The tomatoes were a little week. Fresh brewed tea and other drink options. Decor was great and several TVs with sports on. We would go back for sure."}, {"review_id": "Wx_EB8AuaTkwgtxch1ujZg", "user_id": "DKnX4Y4rNCp_-xbGSSGLWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Love the vegetarian options, would love it more if they added a vegan patty without the cheese.

We're treated with great hospitality as soon as we entered by the owner I believe. Sweet elderly lady. Burgers and shakes were amazing. Assuming most of the menu is great from experience.

Well let me tell you this place isn't really an Italian restaurant. It seems like they were an Italian place but switched over to burgers and fries. (They do have a separate menu of BASIC pasta and pizza you have to ask for this menu as it's not part of the main menu)While disappointed we were still hungry! You wait in a line at the front of the restaurant, order then choose your table and your \"server\" brings you your food. You pay for your food before you receive it as well as tip the \"server\" before you've really gotten any service. (This was hard for me because I believe that the tip is earned not deserved. Moving on!)We chose a table upstairs because it was very busy, however the lighting was awful it reminded us of sitting in a bar. Our \"server\" dropped our food off and never checked in with us again didn't fill our drinks or even check to see if we had enough ketchup... we went and grabbed the bottles of 3 other tables and managed to get enough out of the 4 bottles for dinner. Bottom line: we won't be back.Food was okayAtmosphere was dark Staff were cold and seemingly upset to be busy"}, {"review_id": "4OPPohq6Pl8XALRU7W1Gaw", "user_id": "E_hFLi-Ha2INum2V6Mc04g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Great, friendly service.

I'm from out of town and was looking for a good burger. This place came up and had good reviews. I honestly don't know why or how this place has good reviews. The only thing good that I experienced was the customer service I got from the person who took my order. Very nice kid!! I did have a brief conversation with the co- owner and she seemed more argumentative than actually wanting to rectify the problem. Bottom line- if you want a good burger this is not the spot. It was not good quality food and I think it may have even been a frozen patty that was just thrown on the grill."}, {"review_id": "DEOI2f01u5hLgb3VT-Q2rA", "user_id": "KdIQh78MbsbZ2Aq0pqZv9Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "Great little place in downtown Cheyenne.

Target staff overheard my mention 2 Doors Down and highly recommended. Glad they did! We were greeted with a warm welcome at this venue with a woman who opened the door for us, explained the ordering process, and overviewed what was gluten free. I ordered the fish tacos because they accommodated with corn tortillas in place of the flour. Gluten free sweet potato fries, too! My partner ordered a burger. Food was tasty and delivered timely. We ate in the dim-lit upstairs section, fewer customers to accommodate the noise-level so I could make a business call. Lots of gluten free options here. The same woman opened the door for us as we left. She kindly asked where we were headed to then proceeded to direct us the best way to get back on the highway."}, {"review_id": "u_MT0yGqelcYVPE6XwHz7g", "user_id": "aMtEYdxluXpCz3gvU8NYwg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "So this was a place I was told I had to go when I arrived in town...and everyone was right.

This place is great. I only had the field green and apple salad with Chicken added to it but it was fresh and delicious. Dressing was good and presentation was great... But that is not what gets this place a 5 star review... It is friendliness and compassion of the staff. Pleasantries are thrown around to all patrons and they even have a sweet lady at the front to greet you with a smile and welcoming conversation while you wait in line. Everyone is warm hearted and happy to serve you...All the way down to the young gentleman with Down Syndrome that provides you with napkins and utensils for your meal. I will definitley be back and excited to try their delicious sounding burgers next!"}, {"review_id": "R1WU3u9Av7ee0IbXG1qBtg", "user_id": "4QmEUT7R10JCJ5bVEmPA0w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Fries and ranch are the best here.. burgers are pretty good too.. never had a problem with service, but can get kind of pricey.."}, {"review_id": "oK2llJ3ArwpuEiXVSnGycA", "user_id": "QvvVLwKAK2zTV0lMMJbVmQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/17/2017", "text": "Burgers are okay, nothing really special. I got the teriyaki burger and the bun was a bit soggy. We came in from the rain and the woman at the counter offered me a napkin which was nice. Customer service could use a bit of work, we were only offered a refill on our fries when we were headed out the door. This place always seems busy, which is not really comfortable for us. Nice location being downtown but good luck finding parking on a Friday, it was our first time trying it so we didn't really know where to park. Overall, burgers are okay, fries are average, and customer service is moderate. Wish they had bottomless fry option for sweet potato fries. I've had better BBQ burgers in my backyard."}, {"review_id": "yxYl4SUrAAJNm3A6GR-rog", "user_id": "ZFXp6M45zRrVP_WcD2kusA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Great place and fast.

Peppercorn burger is my favorite, but all the burgers I have tried have been really good. Fries are excellent and come as a bottomless supply for the hungry folks. All around a solid place in a nice building down town."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/2-doors-down-cheyenne?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
