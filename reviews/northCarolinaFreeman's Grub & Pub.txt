Rich wood tones on the bar and tables somehow grant it an elegance the size doesn't necessarily suggest, while the varied assortment of bar stools keeps a welcoming homey vibe. The draft list is unique from any I've seen, every option was a uniquely crafted brew (I had the Anubis, made from a 3000 year old recipe). The food menu had lots of good looking options, and I selected a highly enjoyable brisket sandwich, with some absolutely amazing smashed red potatoes. Service and cleanliness were on point as well, I'm already tempted to make a return trip to explore more of the menu and drafts."}, {"review_id": "-68Ip2OGLq3sWirAQDiDlw", "user_id": "5uJTJnINckyAchF6mf7sLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Our favorite place in town hands down when we need food + r&r.   Interesting beers on tap guaranteed.  Small regular menu has something for everyone.  Weekly specials reveal a creative and engaged kitchen.

The jalapeños were hot though, so be warned. I tried a bite and it was good, but my special omelet was on a whole new level of good. So good in fact that the Special omelet is one of the best omelets I've ever eaten. Ordered it over a side of cheddar hasbrowns, which have rosemary in them and were unreal. The omelet  had sirloin, bacon, smoked blue cheese crumbles....need I say more? I'm already upset it won't be on the menu in the future as their specials change each week!Daniel & Claire normally work brunch - good, attentive servers, although coffee wasn't topped off when water was refilled, which it should have been, but the offer of a to-go cup made up for it (however the to-go cup lids don't fit on the cups, which is just a spillage disaster, and my friends ended up throwing the coffee away).If you haven't been, make a point to go! Brunch starts at 11 am on the weekend and it is well worth it."}, {"review_id": "Y5bDIQbWm7oeXgNkDKMsRg", "user_id": "babz0Skb20B2C-y4oUof5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/17/2017", "text": "Everything about the brunch my friends and I had at Freeman's last Saturday was positive! We arrived promptly when they opened at 11 am and were seated immediately. They were serving both their lunch and brunch menus which provided ample delicious options. I ordered the BBQ Eggs Benedict which is topped with an amazing hollandaise sauce and jalapeños. I also chose the Gouda grits as my side which were extremely tasty. The portion size was large and it was reasonably priced. I also thought their coffee was really good and was glad they offered free refills. In addition to the great food, I was extremely impressed with the service. Our waiter Daniel was very personable and helpful explaining the menu. All meat options are priced the same so they can be substituted for any entree. He also offered us to-go cups of coffee which was a nice gesture and brought out a slice of chocolate covered bacon for my friend's birthday! Can't wait to visit next time I'm in Greensboro!"}, {"review_id": "D5gbfyo7YcHF8ZT9_BuHCA", "user_id": "PysnajRiq6JdxPW4haZgcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "Great summer stop! I could foresee parking may be a hindrance on a busy Saturday night. I came here on a Thursday night. It was sparsely populated. The atmosphere is least what you expect. I expected it to be pretty close and tight. As you walk in, you get a feel of the beers on tap. The bar has some really flavorful, robust beers.  I am sure they change up what's on tap; nonetheless, have a chug of that black hole if you enjoy robust flavour. There is an inside and outdoor seating area. They have a menu special filled with an appetizer, dessert, and of course a menu course. I had enjoyed the summer crab salad. It was such a delight. It was filled with watermelons, greens and avocado. The dressing on it blended the flavours of the fresh ingredients. There are not many placards in greensboro that do a decent job with a crab cake - Grubs got it down packed!"}, {"review_id": "8PeZOJBlWq3KutBf2aF8dQ", "user_id": "a940ta3ya525SSPApjGuZg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2017", "text": "Great location and Great Service , Food not so much .Our sandwiches were dry and the demi glaze dipping sauce we got was as salty as an ocean. Fried chicken sandwich was merely alright but the blackened chicken sandwich was extremely dry and choky. Fries with their Herby seasoning was extremely salty too. while the street corn looked impeccable it didnt have tons of flavor and tasted alright.

It's a nice quaint bar off spring garden street which is right down from the college​-UNCG.  They do have an outside deck to dine and drink on, you walk straight to the back and you'll see the door to the right. I ordered the Mac n Cheese spring rolls ($6) they were good. The only thing I would change about them is the Mac n cheese was a tad dry other than that they were good."}, {"review_id": "msTAuyZiLZDScJefE0KNLQ", "user_id": "bbhN_O6wVZPSeXbInrGU2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "This should be your next spot for weekend brunch!

Even better than the drinks is the food menu, which is the best value in the Triad.  Its inventive, full of interesting ideas that taste fantastic and cost less than buying the same 'ol crap at a chain restaurant.  You're not going to find better entrees anywhere at these prices.Plus they're open at all hours, ready for a weekday late-night dinner, or a weekend brunch.  I try to eat here at least once a week."}, {"review_id": "vIT-XBycNdK2HzxdK5XT6A", "user_id": "2bXVq45PutReWJ7CV236mw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/4/2017", "text": "Best Yelp find so far!  Pub food with flair and aaaahmazing palette satisfying combinations .  It was truly hard to decide, but the Brisket sandwich with pimento cheese and street corn side hit the spot.The custom infused cocktails (jalapeño /strawberry infused tequila) couldn't have been a nicer surprise! Small indoor seating, quaint patio seating is where we enjoyed our dinner. Also hats off the more than accommodating staff for anticipating our needs as we rolled up (scaring the regulars I'm sure) with 9 kids in tow.
