The interior is very tastefully done, while borrowing some elements of India yet being very elegant and modern with the use of colors, and windows displaying spices, kebabs, tandoor ovens, etc, sorta giving the feeling of walking into a taste factory. The menu has delicious offerings and their appetizers are a must-have. I had the chicken wings which had the perfect tandoori taste without being too spicy yet being perfectly cooked. The fried okra is recommended too. We also tried the Chicken Biryani which was tasty!I cannot wait to get to the place to try out their other offerings."}, {"review_id": "SfdYM4RyagyUdzB8vJ4jng", "user_id": "jcFgHWZv88dSBXwkc6qTJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Because the outside looked like a fast food restaurant with a drive through window, I was very suspicious, but I'd been told by several people that it was worth giving a try.No, it's not the slow-cooked, super-savoury, ultra rich cuisine I'm used to, but I can't walk away and say it's bad, either --- in fact, it's quite tasty, and the staff are awesome.Reading some of the other reviews, they are correct --- the menu is rather limited --- but Indian-food-snobs are not the market this place caters to.  It's quick, it's simple and the selection they offer hits the majority of the unique flavors you're after, making them perfect for a fast lunch, a sample of basic Indian food, a craving-quencher when you really need samosas without calling them in, and a less daunting place for first-time who are overwhelmed by the number choices on a standard Indian menu.Again, it's not my usual cup of tea for fine dining, but if anyone expects that from here they're only being pretentious.

Indian restaurants are usually intimidating- they can be dark inside, uninviting and I never know what the items on the menu actually are... I love Indian food, so it's extra disappointing when I don't feel comfortable visiting an Indian restaurant.  Tandur has created the most inviting, open, bright and welcoming restaurant. They even have a TV screen where you can click through and take a peak at what the menu items look like.  If you continue to browse through their digital menu, they even explain the different types of spices that are used in their entrees!!   The food is absolutely delicious, everything I've ordered has tasted amazing.

They showed us photos of the food, and gave us samples of the sauces to try. They even marked a menu with the vegan items. We were able to substitute items replacing non vegan with vegan items.

We definitely want to go back! The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and the woman at the counter took the time to review/explain the menu to us. I was expecting a more formal/sit down restaurant so I was surprised that it's actually more of a casual cafe type of place. Not that it's bad at all! If you are looking for a traditional Indian restaurant you will want to go somewhere else. But the flavors are spot on. Everything was fresh and they offered to let us taste the sauces before we ordered. We ended up with the chicken bowl and the lamb meatballs with coconut curry sauce and saffron rice. We didn't care for the yogurt sauce that came with the bowl but we pretty much inhaled everything else."}, {"review_id": "M42EnyTaejYGh_ONmtVlSw", "user_id": "SbD5nvq69xSAOck6VaLUPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/24/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "*** EDIT Updating to 5 stars. After talking to one of the very friendly owners, he helped me figure out several ways to modify items on their menu to vegan friendly. ***It's a cool looking place and the cashier was very friendly and helpful. The smell of the place is wonderful ... flame fired ovens.They are not completely vegan friendly. Even the rice has dairy in it. There are very few vegan items but if you are vegetarian you are in luck.I got the Mumbai Veggie Wrap without the jalapeño sauce (not vegan) and had a side of the vindaloo sauce added. Initially I was going to rate them 3 stars for the limited options, but after eating this wrap that would be just wrong. It was wonderful. Very tasty and great spicy heat.This would be a 5 star place if they just added a couple of vegan options."}, {"review_id": "cSj9vBmyUIuk7uWvONuDAg", "user_id": "8guuP2a08sUuuM2EDNXtlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "I really enjoy this place; the food is delicious.  The restaurant itself is clean, comfortable, with an urban feel.  The atmosphere is casual, friendly ... it's an easy pick for me anytime.  My FAVORITES are Tikka Marsala w/ chicken ... soooo freaking good.... lately I've been ordering the Salmon Kebabs.  The Salmon is seasoned just right and cooked through every time -- none of that glossy, raw fish for me. A friend had me try the TANDURI WINGS ..... this is a wonderful take on traditional wings ONLY BETTER.  I always order the SPICED OKRA FRIES to share ... I really could just eat this  -- it is that good.  The Naan Bread... SOOO GOOD.  I've started buying Naan Bread at my house because of this place.  I believe Tandur is locally owned, which is another great reason to support it.

Highly recommend. Tried for the first time this week, came back for dinner the next night. The first time I got the Kadai (Red onions, bell peppers, chili tomato oil) with chicken. It's a thick, creamy, soup-like entree served with rice (I got brown rice) and naan (I got garlic). Superb meal. Heavy for lunch but excellent. Not terribly spicy but just enough to make it interesting. Second time here, in an effort to find something a bit lighter, I got the salmon kebab. Two perfectly crispy, spicy delicious salmon filets with rice (I got basmati this time - also spectacular). I didn't love the mango slaw because I'm not much of a raw onion person so I'm going to get something else next time. But between the rice and the salmon I really didn't need more food so I was fine skipping on the slaw.

With a very modern interior and plenty of menu options and variety, I would definitely be a frequent visitor if I lived here.There are a few different entrees to choose from - protein + sauce combo (comes with rice and naan), salads, wraps, and kebabs. I had the saag with tofu, and, though it didn't look like a lot of food, I was definitely full by the time I finished my meal. We also ordered the spiced okra fries to share - a bit hard to eat and not spicy, but flavorful and a nice appetizer to split. I also tried the ginger chai - a very true UNSWEET chai, which I loved. Very herbally.I would love to go back to try their lassi (they have seasonal lassi too!) and kebab entrees. Prices were decent for a fast/quick but filling meal.

I think that Tandur took over an old Wendy's? I'm not positive, but it definitely used to be a fast food joint. With it they do update the interior and also put in a couple of tandoors to cook naan the correct way. Another thing to mention is that they have a touch style menu on the back wall if you can't see the menu from the line. But, their menu isn't that big so that shouldn't be the biggest problem.So let's get to the food. We ordered two entrees and also an appetizer. We shared the Chicken Samosa, which was really delicious, and I think was the best out of all the three dishes. It came with two sauces, one sweet and one more of a yogurt type of sauce.I ordered the Kerala Coconut Curry and my valentine ordered the Vindaloo. Let's just say that the Vindaloo is spicy, so if you're not trying to eat anything spicy I would suggest to order something else. It was too spicy for her, so I switched with her and she thoroughly enjoyed the Kerala Coconut Curry as it wasn't too spicy. But even though that it isn't spicy, it was well seasoned. If you're up in the air, I would recommend this one over the Vindaloo.Overall, this place is great because it's not the traditional Indian restaurant where you have a bigger menu with more options. I think this place is more of a fast food type of spot. I don't quite necessarily think that a customer needs to come in and sit in. It can definitely be a take out spot just as much as it is a sit down."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/tandur-indian-kitchen-knoxville?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
