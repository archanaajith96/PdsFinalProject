Burnt ends were amazing! Rib bones were huge, meaty, and well-spiced. Spoon bread was excellent. The pulled pork and pit ham were so-so, and the rest of the sides were good but not mind-blowing. Food came out fast, service was good. I've been here twice, and I live 90 minutes away. It's good food, good enough to make a special trip if you're in the area."}, {"review_id": "12lfwPZ05G5rqpUdTTpvTg", "user_id": "gF84Nwzf6ZaYjDVkQWtFIw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Be adventurous and explore this menu. There are better ribs elsewhere. However, the other smoked meats and side are all-stars in their own right. My top meat choices are burnt ends, jalapeno cheddar sausage, and the wings. Top sides are green Chile Mac n cheese, corn spoon bread, and potato casserole.Other things to try are banana pudding, house pickles, and the Shig Pig sandwich."}, {"review_id": "32eeFfie616mnm_8HHub3w", "user_id": "IPvcKxN40EqaChHJjUjFbg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "Meh.The water was shut down by the City of Fort Wayne on the Saturday when we went. Apparently, the manager learned restaurant service from a DVD as there was no sign apologizing for the inconvenience. Nor did anyone come out to the dining area and apologize to the patrons. The staff also wasn't particularly friendly. They took your order and then just looked at you instead of thanking for your patronage. You know...the thing that pays their salaries. They also seemed to be more interested in Being with one another than they were in doing their jobs.Strike three: The food was mediocre. While it is better than say Chili's r Applebee's BBQ, it isn't good enough to recommend it to anyone. I have MADE better BBQ than the two meals for which I paid roughly $32. And again...the water was OFF at the restaurant.Shorty's in Toledo is a little over an hour away and their BBQ is always off the chain. Drive there and make a day trip of it if you want exceptional BBQ. Go to SHig's if you don't want to drive or you don't own a car."}, {"review_id": "9bSbXiGFif_tHRfhWF7vEQ", "user_id": "J4i1fXAkPab6Ig0cI4_dsQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Freshly microwaved presmoked meats and slow service make this a 2-Star restaurant.

With some cole slaw.  The food was phenomenal! I also enjoyed the three BBQ sauce options.  Brisket was very sot, easy to cut with a fork.  The cole slaw had a bit of a horseradish taste. I love horse radish and cole slaw, so it was perfect.  Even the garlic bread was good.  I liked this place (and the name) so much I bought a t-shirt.My only complaint is I would have preferred an actual waitress I'm not a big fan of the whole order at this window and pick up at this window.  Seems like a ballpark set up.It was so good, I'll definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "uHT-2B2wVxHx4wnCoXq2AA", "user_id": "xCOoicoiJUGOUL1nR1bzPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2017", "text": "I love Shigs in Pit! I always enjoy chowing down on this BBQ whether its catered in at work and stopping into the cute space off Fairfield. If you stop into the restaurant, you will immediately be taken back by the amazing smell. You can find red and white checkered tables and banners up on the walls from numerous awards they have won! The staff is always super friendly and the service is prompt. You order at the counter and they call your name when your order is up. My two favorite items from the menu are the pulled pork and the green chili mac n' cheese, you must try! Top it off with their tangy, original or hot BBQ sauce and you have the perfect meal. They have various specials during the week and over lunch time. If you are looking for good BBQ in the area, stop into Shigs in Pit.

Service was great ! It's self seating so you sit were you want , and wait until they call your name and you go and pick up your little basket . I was happy that they had the different type of sauce bottles on the table and I didn't have to walk up anywhere to get more sauce so that was awesome! And they have little wipes sitting in this little bucket to clean yourself after a delicious messy lunch or dinner, they have a lot of seating and the decor is so cute they have red and white checkered tables and  gotten a whole bunch or awards and trophies for competitions they have been in that are showcased in the seating area, so when I saw all of them I knew it was gonna be great .I ordered the 1 meat special that comes with two sides , I ordered the beef brisket and apple pie baked beans and the green chile mac and cheese! OMGGGG!!! The baked beans were AMAZING ! Like nothing I've had before the baked beans had pieces of applie pie in it and omg delicious . I'm obsessed with green chiles jalapenos , basically anything spicy so I had to get the mac and cheese and it was amazing as well , with the little pieces of green chiles it gave it the perfect little kick. The beef brisket was sooo good honestly probably one of the best I've had !!! And then it came with a garlic toast that was perfect , it wasn't burned or hard just nice and soft how I like it and fresh . im so craving it again right now ! All of that for the small price of like 11 bucks or so ! Honestly I couldn't find anything wrong with this place it was off the chain !! This place is really high up there on the best BBQ spots in the US ."}, {"review_id": "unnLZOO5lsLw8ji4rZDIPg", "user_id": "LynQaiz-fSMPFfUwDoUjLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/14/2017", "text": "just some damn good, reasonably-priced bbq!  you can smell it from the parking lot.  the interior is adorned with fun bbq-related decor, with blues music playing in the background for the ultimate bbq experience- sliced brisket: perfect salt level, delicious seasoning, and cooked to a tender texture.  nothing beats some good brisket!- jalapeno & cheddar sausage: oozes with melted cheddar bits, and packs ample jalapeno heat and flavour- green chili mac n cheese: wow, the sliced green chili really elevates mac n cheese to a completely new level.  love it!- spoon cornbread: leans towards bread pudding due to its mushy texture, plus it's on the sweeter side from added corn, but it's still tasty- potato salad thing: merely ok.  i like that they leave the potato skins on- garlic toast: a bit soft, but still goodhighly recommended!"}, {"review_id": "tqbd1VVAUDWcvo3z7th4Bg", "user_id": "hqrO0l_MF7P9MuUtexj4Dg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "Went at the recommendation of family who loved it.

We had burned pieces throughout and was most of what you tasted. The mac n cheese was good in theory but didn't taste like much. It was just meh. My husband liked his jalapeño sausage and ribs.

I slathered the turkey in the Hot BBQ sauce and it was flavorful but had a nice kick to it.Overall I was very impressed with this place and it took a lot of willpower not to order and devour a dessert-not to mention for a BBQ joint it was reasonably priced.I know where I will be coming again if I am in Fort Wayne and need of a taste of real Soothern barbecue!"}, {"review_id": "lr3gCjz0blivJnvL46hSaQ", "user_id": "ASVtLHXujKnofiXOzJ421Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/12/2017", "text": "Our first visit to the Fairfield location.

I wasn't sure about this place...at first. With a name like \"Shigs in Pit\" I couldn't help but think (and I'm sure the owners were quite aware of the name) that it sounds like \"Pigs in Shit\". As in \"Happier than...\"But please, don't let the name fool ya!I noticed the sign as I passed the restaurant...\"Shigs in Pit\". I thought to myself \"What the...?\" Curiosity got the best of me, so I turned around and had to give this place a try.It was a good sign when I noticed a bunch of marked and unmarked Fort Wayne police cars parked outside the place. It was just pass noon, so I assumed the police force stopped in for a bite. This place has to be good if the Fort Wayne PD was eating here. Found out also that the Fort Wayne Fire Department patronized this place.Figured I start small and work myself up. I ordered the PULL PORK sandwich for $5.99, a side of their macaroni & cheese along with a soft-drink (Mello-Yello).RESULT: OUTSTANDING!I've heard people complain about the meat being too dry. Well, not me. The prices may be a bit on the \"expensive\" side, but...what are you going to do? If the meat is too dry, drown it in the BBQ sauce that's available in a squirt bottle on every table.I can't elaborate enough about how awesome this sandwich was.
