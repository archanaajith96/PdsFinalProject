Their smoked chicken with white bbq sauce is my favorite. They have many locations and this one is not my favorite simply because they don't have sweet potato fries like \"Saw's Juke Joint\" but the food is still great. It is also in a very popular and up-n-coming area on Birmingham. The area is safe and this place is usually packed; its also nice to get it to go and take it next door to the brewery to eat it outside. They are also GREAT at catering. This was one of my go-to places when I lived in Birmingham and would cater for my company. They are so helpful and will deliver, setup and take care of everything. I definitely recommend them for that!"}, {"review_id": "tgr2QCqqcMwxTABS3XgUCQ", "user_id": "r9Zx6w0G6ww-yyHcEbysEw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Walking in, this place felt like a hidden gem, or hole in the wall. On the outside you can see the remaints of the word barber. This place has character and history.The service and food itself was alright. It's counter service, as acoustomed in BBQ. I ordered a oyster poboy, fries, and 5 wings. The poboy was okay, the bread was really good; but it wasn't memorable and didn't feel like I was eating BBQ. The fries were really good.The star of the show was the chicken, it was smoky and juicy and charred. The chicken was served with a white BBQ sauce, and if I was in charge, I would put that sauce on everything, it was so good. I'm taking off points because I felt like the table was lacking sauce. On the table was a spicy vinegar sauce, but there was no in-house BBQ sauce that I've come to expect."}, {"review_id": "Cgiv3M-xGf9WcZgFPZfg6Q", "user_id": "dzJL8hnZXTTWUrZm1WSc-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "The other week, I had guests in town who wanted to eat Saw's while they were here. We had only been to the one in Homewood, so I suggested we try the location in Avondale to see the differences. We arrived a little after 1, hitting the back end of the lunch rush, giving us plenty of time to decide. The problem with this place is that they have way too many great options! I decided to go with the lunch special on that day, which was a sweet tea fried chicken sandwich topped with pimento cheese and the white BBQ sauce. I don't think I'll be able to look at other fried chicken sandwiches the same, and the pimento cheese was a nice touch! There was hardly any seating in the restaurant, so we grabbed our food and headed to the courtyard at the brewery next door to enjoy. Compared to the one in Homewood, this location seemed to offer more fried options but still had the same delicious quality. There is a reason this is one of the most popular places in Birmingham and I can't wait to return to try the rest of the menu!"}, {"review_id": "SIPhyxk81fKa-0YhNfktBA", "user_id": "onf6w46rNp8ckYq9jmZXSg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "According to a newspaper clipping on the wall the name Saw is Chef Wilson's high school nickname \" Sorry A** Wilson\". The parking is horrendous --  a few parallel spaces and lots of tow away zones surround this tiny hole in the wall. The food, however is worth the hassle. I had the Pork and Greens -- huge serving of thin onion rings piled on pulled pork piled on a pile of tender sweet collard greens surrounded by a lake of cheese grits -- stupendous! Hubby had smoked sausage but didn't care much for the fried corn on the cob as it was covered in the white bbq sauce he's not fond of ( I liked it). If you go, be there when it opens, expect parking frustration, and be prepared to sit outside as there are only 6 tables in the place.

I have zero complaints.  The food was both homey and heavenly.You order the food inside the store and since there is limited seating you can sit out back in the patio area.  They bring your food out to you on the patio.  Even in January, it was a very pleasant day when we visited, so it was nice to sit out back on the patio and enjoy the nice weather while eating that amazing food.  5 out of 5 stars.  Would definitely return to Saw's Soul Kitchen!  Excellent food in Birmingham, Alabama."}, {"review_id": "cOeSZlPwqXYzbRVYUREFvg", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "What to get: sweet tea fried chicken sandwichService: 4/5Atmosphere: dive, take out, fast casualWait: 5 mins (Wednesday 1PM for 1)Parking: parking lotThe Experience:I try my best to go at the most off times to miss the crowd and I'm glad I did.First, there's a shared parking lot for multiple restaurants, but Saw's is around the corner. Parking was almost full for a late lunch time, so I wonder what it would've been like at a more popular time (instead of a rainy Wednesday afternoon in winter).The place is small. Really small. You got to keep their doors closed and there's literally 6 tables inside. 4 seats per table. Only 24 diners can eat here at a time. When I went, 4 of those tables were full, and I was there eating solo. If it were too crowded, I would have taken my food to-go and eat in my car.I ordered the sweet tea fried chicken sandwich, which comes with pickles and a white sauce on top. If you get the meal, you get a side and a drink. If you're greedy, like me, you order just the sandwich and a stuffed tater. I was only able to eat the sandwich, but damn, that chicken was fried beautifully. I loved the texture of the crunch and the sauce gave it a more wholesome flavor. Yes, I'd have to agree that this is one of the best fried chicken meals I've had now living in the 'south.'They have a variety of stuffed taters, which I thought were tater tots...boy, was I shocked when I got this enormous stuffed potato! I had to take it to go since there was no way I could finish it there. It could have been a meal on its own, honestly.If you're in town and able to miss the crowds and rush, I'd definitely check Saw's. One of the more satisfying fried chicken meals I've had, so it was worth it to trek out there."}, {"review_id": "4yjEmBjOi86bOrEuhrdXgw", "user_id": "Ty8k7Wj3kXMcCvOHsu-ptQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "If you haven't already, go for the 1st time without hesitation!This is my 2nd visit to this location and I always want to order EVERYTHING on the menu, seriously.

The food is consistently delicious across locations, but I love the authentic, old-school vibe of this spot. When the weather is warm, it's perfect because of the outside dining space; however, when it's cold (if you want to dine in), the space is limited. I haven't had a dish I didn't like. From the sweet tea fried chicken sandwich, to the pork and greens, to the cheeseburger, you CAN'T go wrong. The sides are pretty fantastic, too. The sweet potato fries are a go-to for me, but I went for the fried green tomatoes today and they did not disappoint. Some friends dining with us ordered the deviled eggs and had nothing but complimentary things to say.  Given the small space and the popularity of this location (with high volumes of patrons to serve), I commend their efficient service."}, {"review_id": "C5TeEiDLhK_44Ik17X_-0w", "user_id": "D6s9lEKs44EXmK9fiMjYCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Located in the newly re-gentrified area known as Avondale, Saw's is a hit!!

Thank goodness it wasn't very crowded when we went as their isn't a whole lot of seating.I got the pork and greens which is a layer of cheese grits followed by collards, pulled pork, and lastly onion rings. I'm not a big fan of onion rings, but love their really thinly cut onion rings. I really like putting their bbq sauce on top of it all. The pork and greens with a drink is 14 dollars plus tip. The portions are really big and will put you in a food coma.

I have been to the Juke Joint, the original Homewood location, and this one in Avondale several times. In my opinion, this location gets the lower rating. My reasoning is twofold: the building as well as my most recent food encounter. The building is extremely tiny even though it has an awesome \"hole in the wall\" feel and experience. This makes for a longer wait time at peak hours. I recommend coming for an early lunch or dinner. My most recent experience also had sub par food. I ordered the smoked white chicken plate with the white sauce and two sides to carry over to the Avondale brewery. The chicken was dry and there was barely ANY of the white sauce on it. The chicken is just not the same without the white sauce. The sides of cheese grits and slaw tasted fine, but I was just disappointed because I love the smoky, wet chicken meat with the white sauce and both were just lacking! I will always support Saw's and still come here when in Avondale and craving BBQ; and trust me-they still are the best BBQ in Birmingham( hands down), but I prefer the original Homewood location or the Juke Joint in Mtn Brook."}, {"review_id": "CV5D3Pv6VttGxYV42qAwJw", "user_id": "OvpjSZ5I6P6yCc6A_KrzRA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Coming to Alabama we had to try some BBQ.
