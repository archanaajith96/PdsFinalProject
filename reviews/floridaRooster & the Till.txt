Yummy food and wonderful staff. And a great place to take visit family and friends. It's hip and modern, but not obnoxious. I loved he decor and being able to watch the kitchen at work in the middle of the restaurant. Our waitress was amazing. She was so kind and knowledgeable. I would have the thought of being thirsty and she'd refill my glass before the thought was complete. Not sure whether the food or service was better. Really enjoyed our dishes. We indulged in a crispy Vietnamese dish, the short rib gnocchi and the fried quail. The fried quail and aioli were sort of like really really good chicken wings. The gnocchi was soft and pastry-like. Really lovely texture I hadn't had before with gnocchi. The fish was good, it' sauce was great. Dip. Every. Bite. While I really enjoyed the food, I wasn't totally blown away. I think part of that could be that I heard so many people say how amazing it was that it got overhyped. Either way it was a good meal (though a bit pricey) and I'm sure I'll return and definitely recommend."}, {"review_id": "u-unHBOb-jaGYvpa79mrHA", "user_id": "3yP7VaBGj49vBvKYxlSPPQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Ordered brussells sprouts, pork belly, and gnocchi.The sprouts were good but not great. They came with some flavorful ham and buttery aioli but they had a little too much vinegar.The pork belly had a great sweetness and the top of the pork belly was crispy. The cornbread had a nice crisp at the bottom. Unfortunately, the meat was a little too tough and it was severely lacking in salt. The salt was greatly needed to contrast with the sweetness of the dish that came from the spiced honey sauce.The gnocchi itself was quite good. Very tender and not overcooked. The sauce was nice and the spicy pickled pepperonata was a great contrast though it wasn't actually spicy. Only complaint is that the sauce itself was overly salty.The inside is nice but so loud that it's hard to have a conversation without screaming. If you happen to sit at the kitchen bar be warned that it is uncomfortably hot being close to the burners, etc.Overall good food that's somewhat overpriced and whether you like the atmosphere will really come down to personal preferences."}, {"review_id": "6cXe3qGpU6X3aZsPXRhjZQ", "user_id": "fr1Hz2acAb3OaL3l6DyKNg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "I am excited finally to try out this restaurant.

The action in the kitchen was presented in front you when you just a few feet away. I like the action and coordination between chefs. I start with lamb neck with over the dumplings top with salad. This dish meat was obtained from the neck area. The meat was braised me dumplings below is fried. The top salad was very delicious. The hot sauce below just accommodate well with the dish. The second dish is risotto with lobster. The risotto was cook with lobster and wild mushrooms. The edge was green color by caramelize fennel and top with lemon fraiche.

Next, we had lobster risotto, with wild mushrooms, caramelized fennel, and lemon crepe fraiche.    Another winner. The crime fraiche kept the risotto from getting too thick, and all the flavors had there moments in the sun.  We concluded with corvina that paired with potatoes, white beans, escarole, and chili flakes.  The fish had a hint of sweetness, the skin was crisp, and the chili flakes added just the right amount of bite.Three skillfully prepared dishes that left me eager to return."}, {"review_id": "LN2SykFn4-2UwCdKdx5Ujw", "user_id": "uq6wEQ7yEEw9q0pAeGx1AQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "When did Tampa become a foodie place? Traffic was hideous so I decided to take a random exit somewhere in Tampa to eat. Found this place via Yelp and was only a half mile from the exit. As a huge foodie from Chicago, I must say this place surprised me because it's in Tampa. The food is plated beautifully and the flavors are unique yet approachable. The menu is something I'd find in Chi, NYC, Or San Fran.I had the Crispy Cobia with Nuoc Cham sauce, awesome and a must here. I also tried their Foi Gras, Lobster Risotto, and had the Coconut Pudding for dessert. All very interesting textures and creative flavors that mostly worked. My least favorite had to be the dessert, although good not great. The boba in it I think was overkill. It was an unnecessary distracting texture that took away from the other delicious layers. The service was excellent, but just be aware of that any zero proof drinks they make off menu for you is charged at the alcoholic price and size. The virgin mojito was very good but came in a 6oz glass of mostly ice and was $11. After explaining the non sense pricing of this drink, the manger fixed it. I would return to try other items in the future. This place is great for foodies."}, {"review_id": "h566doPSHi6bdP0fgIPeGg", "user_id": "BLBumLX-7oLKY-_3BkPr2w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Came here for my fiancé's birthday with friends.

Located in a developing and changing part of town, I was surprised to see how soothing and welcoming it was upon entering. Bar stools please. I and a friend sat at a bar and got prepped by a supper friendly wait staff who went over the menu with us. The menu is not overwhelming but its uniqueness can be a bit much to absorb especially when your brain has not been fed yet. Luckily this was not my friends first rodeo with Rooster so that helped a lot. We ordered 4 out of the 6 items listed on the slightly larger menu. Gnocchi, middlins risotto, R&tT fish, and the black garlic braised beef shank. Based on these four items we tried, I can say the flavours of the menu are most definitely internationally inspired. You can taste a bit of every continent and what I wondered the most was how their menu comes about. Its definitely unique in a sense that Rooster cannot be placed in a box when it comes to the type of food served. By the way all dishes were good. As limited as the menu was, the bar was also miniscule. Wine and beer. No complaints there as the ambience, customer service and food made up for my crave for mixed drinks."}, {"review_id": "V2qsTbDLpodYSmDcoCMEkw", "user_id": "2gIrOGeUQiIyH3OxYQnDiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Step-by-step instructions:1.

I want to make sure I spend enough time here before the Heights blossoms and new hotspots line North Florida Ave in coming months. The short-rib ragu pasta and flavorful brussel sprouts were both stellar: just the right amount of food for the light dinner I wanted. The cuisine is taken seriously here, and the choice of options ranging from light bites to entree-sized offerings opens up myriad permutations and combinations depending on how hungry you are. But just wait until you try a cocktail, oh man...Maura the bartender is one of the best in the business given her encyclopedic knowledge of cocktail craft - from striking that optimal balance between sugar and acid, to the right effervescent aromatics that make the perfect accoutrement. And I say this from the frame of reference of someone who frequents DC spots like The Left Door, The Passenger, Bourbon Steak, and Fiola Mare, and is a regular at Death & Company in Manhattan's East Village.

I like eating here fine but don't know if I would go out of my way to come back if I were in the area. The food is decent, but seems too ambitious. I had the foie gras, which had a sweet preparation, and the lobster risotto.The foie was seared and served with a poached pear (okay fine it was specified that it was sous vide, but my unrefined palate just tasted poached pear) and chocolate cashew butter. There was also some berry compote. The foie itself was seared nicely and on top of toast, so far so good. The pear added a subtle sweetness I could get behind. But the cashew nutella was too much, especially when added to the other three sweet things. Maybe I'm just more into savory foie.The lobster risotto was nice and creamy and have a decent amount of lobster chunks. I did think it was a bit salty, but it was very satisfying on a cold day.Oh I also had one oyster haha. It was tasty and fresh. Advertised on the menu as having ginger, but I didn't really taste that but didn't mind because I like my oysters simple.The place also only has wine and beer so cocktails aren't the usual cocktails. I ended up with wine. Service at the bar was pleasant and the bartender was friendly but didn't try to chat, which is always nice.

It has instantly engraved itself into a piece of my Heart. I must say there are about a handful of tampa restaurants I can truly say is unique, flavorful and something you would be unable to get anywhere else and rooster and the till fits that bill.The restaurant itself is very small and intimate with an open kitchen in the middle of the dining area. Thus as soon as you walk in - you will immediately smell all the goodness coming from that kitchen. The menu had both small and large plates but they are all share able and def recommend getting 2 small and 2 larges to split with two people! For the small plates - the scallop crudo stood out over the others. It is raw scallop over a cashew milk gremolata with black sesame and fried chive flowers - amazing ! Another favorite was the schezuan shrimp - head on shrimp with fried oats and green beans. Pasta was also very fresh and delicious! Lastly the highlight of my meal was the rendition of the banana pudding - thai basil, macadamia butterscotch crunch, tapioca and topped with matcha foam! My favorite Thank you rooster and the till for reminding me what Tampas food scene should be about!

We had a group of about 16 people. We arrived first and the tables were setup for our group already. They setup 2 tables that had a separation in between. Not a huge deal, but it kind of split up the group. We would've preferred them to be closer together, but again, minor details. The waiters were very knowledgeable about the menu. They asked about any allergies and since the birthday girl is allergic to peanuts, we were grateful for their attention to detail. My fiancé and I ordered the scallops and the shrimp plates to share. Of course, being this is tapas style, we all ended up trying each other's meals as well. The scallops were good. Very, very thin, but good. I can't say they're amazing. They were just good. The sauce they were in had a little kick, so that put me off as I'm not a big spicy fan. The shrimp was good too. It's Szechuan shrimp, so it was spicier than I could handle. I had one and my fiancé finished the meal. He loves spicy food and thought they were good. It reminded him of Bengali food as that's where he grew up. We also tried the quail from other people's plates. The quail was alright. It tasted like chicken, but I didn't taste any flavors. I only tasted the fried breading on it. I tried some of the gnocchi. My friends thought it was amazing, but to me, it was subpar. I've had better at other places where it tastes so fresh, you feel like it just came out of the pot. The wine selection was nice. They don't offer liquor here, only beer and wine. I had 4 glasses of the Turnbull Estate. It was a nice dry red. Really enjoyed the wine. At the end of the night, our bills came. Now I'm not sure if this was mentioned to our friend who made the reservation or not, but our bill came out to $90 for 2 of us. Between the wine and meals, we didn't spend $90 for the both of us. Everyone at our table had the same puzzled look. When asked, we were told that because we didn't spend $45 a person, they added to our bill to make it so. So for me and my fiancé, we came out to about $60 so they added $30 to our bill to accommodate that rule. Again, I'm not sure if this is because we had so many people or because we made a reservation, but it was never brought up to us prior to our meal. The person who made the reservation may not have mentioned it to us for whatever reason, but it's just a thought in case you happen to go with more than a couple of people. It should also be noted that if you make a reservation and have any no-shows, they will charge you $25 a person. We didn't have any, but just to keep in mind for friends who are flaky. All in all, the food was okay. I've had better and the drive here certainly doesn't make you feel like you're in a safe area. They have quite a few rules when it comes to service too which makes you feel a little stressed because things happen. It's just inevitable. Good food. Good service. Not enough to bring myself back here though."}, {"review_id": "jJwwXojqgxvTETVEib0MwA", "user_id": "yO9pyOUXbF2s7Lwww-b18Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "I have been dying to eat here and I finally got the chance!  It's definitely a place you want to go with people because the menu is set up in portions to share.  My friend and I started with the brussels sprouts, which were perfectly cooked.  They were crispy but not burnt.  The best was the aioli spread across the bottom of the plate.  Delicious!  Our next item was the pork belly with cornbread.  Again, fantastic!  I love pork belly, but sometimes it can be too fatty.  That was definitely not the case.  The pickled apple on top of the pork belly really made the dish.  It was a nice play on the old school pork chops and apple sauce.  This is a must order dish.After the small plates, we ventured to something bigger and ordered the gnocchi with braised beef.  Hands down the best gnocchi I have ever had!  As soon as it hit your mouth, the little pillow just melted in your mouth.In the end we split the bill 50/50 and it came to about $50 each, which included a glass of wine each, 2 small plates, one large plate, and a dessert.  Definitely worth it and will be going back again!"}, {"review_id": "6k92Py6zzzjcgmBP1Pvnsw", "user_id": "xWEKLTw0NWgHS67oCyVp8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/12/2017", "text": "A group of friends and I came here for my birthday and I was so excited to finally get to try this place!

I love craft cocktails and would have expected a place like this to have some pretty epic cocktails. On the other hand, they have a great selection of beer and wine, which I also enjoy(ed). For my review of the food, I must say I was expecting more of a wow factor, which is why I'm giving the Rooster and the Till 4 stars. After reading the reviews from all of my fellow Yelp friends, I was expecting a culinary experience for my tastebuds. While the food was good and the presentation was beautiful, it just wasn't the over the top, must go back tomorrow for more type of good. We ordered the entire bottom half of the menu to share between 5 of us + a few appetizers. Here's my breakdown on the food:The first course we ordered was the Cheese Board. It had a nice variety of cheeses that were delicious, many of them were cheeses we've never tried before. This was a great appetizer to share with five people.Oysters- fresh shucked and the perfect size. We like our oysters with hot sauce (I know not classy) but they don't have hot sauce. Szechuan Head-On Shrimp- These were the biggest shrimp I have ever eaten. They were large and the sauce they were served with had good flavor.Gnocchi- I've had so many amazing dishes of fresh gnocchi (one of my favorite things to order out) and I just wasn't blown away by this dish. It's fresh and it's good but the fresh pasta was way better.Fresh Pasta- This was the best plate we tried and you could tell because it went fast. The pasta was delicious. The sauce was great and the portion size would be the perfect dinner size portion.Fried Quail - This was my first time trying quail and maybe it's just not my thing. Again it was ok, just not mouth watering good and nothing I'd ever order again.R&T Fish- Cooked perfectly. Crunchy on the outside but buttery texture inside. I liked the Fregola Salad it was served with. If you're looking for something like and summery, this would be a good option to choose.Black Garlic Braised Beef Shank- served with brown butter rice grits that were delicious. The flavors of this dish complimented each other well. This was Top 2 on my list of favorites for the night. Wild Boar Chop- Not as flavorful as I would have liked it to be and not ideal for sharing with multiple people. I thought this was the perfect place to order a bunch of plates with a group of friends and try a little of each item. After tasting over half the menu in one sitting, I don't feel the need to come back but am glad we finally tried it out."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/rooster-and-the-till-tampa?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
