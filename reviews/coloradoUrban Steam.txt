My friends and I came here for the first time and our orders are as follows:I had the Tourist - pretty much eggs benedict. Smoked ham was...smoky, just as a smoked ham should be! I thought it tasted great. Accompanying my eggs benedict was a Cubano con leche - or cafe con leche. Espresso and or coffee with sweetened condensed milk. My friends ordered the French toast and the Southern Comfort (chicken and waffles with eggs). Their food not only looked amazing, but they said everything was on point!Overall, we really enjoyed this place and will be coming back!"}, {"review_id": "wz2Ry6U6Syu16b8gvMIxtg", "user_id": "8CIlvjWVohcmsA2RyxArdQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Urban Steam was quite a disappointment, honestly. The disappointment started at the counter. I guess I was momentarily invisible as another gal clearly came up behind me and was helped before me (but whatever, patience is a virtue or something). I had a hard time finding something baby friendly to feed the little one (should've planned better), so I inquired about the quinoa and black bean burger patty option. I was told it would still be the price of the full burger and side. Umm no I don't think I'll be paying $10 for my one year old's lunch. Thanks though. She didn't offer to check with a manager or anything and certainly didn't offer any other suggestions for ideas to feed the kiddo. She also seemed annoyed by me using the Yelp check in deal for half off a drink. So, I finished up with that frustrating situation and took my little number sign back to the table then went on to fix our coffees. The coffee was probably the best part of the experience here. We waited at least 15 minutes for our food to come out. And the disappointment continued. Can't remember the name of what I ordered but it was eggs, black beans, and carnitas on a waffle. The carnitas was undoubtedly cooked in a crock pot with way too much salt. The meat was ice cold in places. Ugh. To top off the experience, I overheard the same server complaining about tips on my way to the restroom. Umm excuse me but do you expect a 20% tip for entering my order into the computer and carrying our plates to the table?! I'm totally cool with self serve drinks and such, but don't expect a good tip for doing nothing. Well, that was a lot of rambling and if you're still reading you deserve a gold star. All in all, big waste of $40 and I definitely wouldn't return."}, {"review_id": "IJiH-se2xSMSa4Afs25sBg", "user_id": "ibJBvtrEvzCWaRRwKF4WGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Amazing hidden gem!Came here for brunch based on Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. They offer indoor as well as outdoor seating. You place your order at the counter, they give you a number, and then they deliver it to your table. I love the variety of options that their menu offers. From breakfast, to lunch items, to coffee, to alcoholic beverages.. it's nice to have such a wide selection.I can't quite remember the name of everything we ordered but I know one of them was the tourist. All dishes were really generous in portions. Definitely enough to fill you up and give you a good taste of what they have to offer. I remember not having a simple complaint about the taste of anything we ordered. Extremely deliciouslyAlso had Cuban coffee, another coffee drink and the mimosa. The prices were reasonable and the staff was really courteous. I will definitely be coming back!"}, {"review_id": "cG0Dumd2vWXSoMyyAOyHnQ", "user_id": "4Z_ouDpGvb0waE9oFFhwIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "From the laid back atmosphere to its eclectic art work on the walls this restaurant was a great way to start off our morning. I ordered the monkey wrench which is a light fluffy waffle with an abundance of fresh bananas, sweet whip cream, crunchy walnuts, and nutella. I also ordered a chia tea latte. It was extra foamy with a design on top and a little kick. Everything tasted made from scratch and fresh. Will come back again. Not a complaint but just a warning the parking is scares and it would be difficult to find seating for more than 4 during their busy times."}, {"review_id": "FsMulxOn7LJqezVjwmZyZQ", "user_id": "aozUEHFiAtS1PecQftbLuw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "I'm not sure what its like on the weekends but on a weekday, its a pretty chill spot. I got a waffle and cortado. Waffle took a few minutes as they made it fresh, I got a gluten free one with no whipped cream. It was probably one of the best gf waffles, I have had. It was actually pretty light and soaked the syrup nicely. The cortado was perfect, strong and perfectly sweet. I'll be back to try more of the menu."}, {"review_id": "GTfc6AoRvQs4Zxx6dEueMg", "user_id": "bKUTEYOCycGwuC-OO24iZw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Whiskey and waffles? STAHP IT.

The coffee is delicious and compare to Starbucks is worth the money. The food tastes Fresh and they have a full kitchen in the back so you know you are getting fresh food and not just microwaved eggs.

Felt a bit discriminated against for not wearing a beanie, skinny jeans and black horn rimmed glasses, the wait staff gave half our table lunch and 30 minutes later got the other two sandwiches out and pretty much tossed the plates in front of us and were a bit pissy after we asked about the two missing sandwiches 15 minutes into the wait. Won't be coming back due to the piss poor 'tudes of the staff. It's too bad because the food was tasty and the concept is fun.
