I drive from OKC any time I'm craving some good Peruvian food because Mamaveca does not disappoint. First, the restaurant is plenty big so you shouldn't have time waiting. Second, FREE QUESO & SALSA. + the tortillas are heavenly and you must order some as soon as you sit down. I then go for the ceviche because they do an incredibly job with it. My other favorites are the jalea (deep fried seafood with Peruvian seasoning) or the arroz chaufa de mariscos (seafood fried rice). with the jalea I'll order a portion of white rice because it goes perfect with the seafood. You'll be so pleased with any of these options (and full because they're big portions!) that you'll want to skip dessert. Don't. The sopapillas are included so order yourself one! The servers are always very kind and the owners are almost always there making sure you are enjoying your meal! That's the kind of restaurant I like to support!"}, {"review_id": "cSQgdai5MBUFC84ecMareg", "user_id": "BsACtrcI497W4ZfA9ab6PQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Its been a while since I came in here. The atmosphere is about the same. Nice and colorful. Very clean inside. I was greeted and seated after about a minute of standing there. It looked like I came as the lunch rush ended which Im glad. The very friendly waiter brought my drink out immediately. Another gentleman brought some chips and salsa with queso. The menu was pretty big. A mix of mexican and peruvian food. Very hard to choose. So many different choices. I ordered the #52 which is a chicken enchilada with sour cream sauce and a chicken flauta. Comes with rice and beans. He also brought some corn tortillas to the table. He brought my food out like after 4 chips. Very fast and it looked great. The flauta was hot and crispy. The enchilada was stuffed with chicken and covered with sour cream sauce and cheese. The sour cream sauce was delicious. The rice and beans were very good too. I would definitely be back to try other choices."}, {"review_id": "n1icknU6cPIQGTy7mg-7bA", "user_id": "-99r5AcVeoFmWhRubszm5w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "My weekly destination for s few years now.

We rarely go out to eat and when we do, its assumed we will all meet at Mamaveca. The speedy delivery of food is crazy! Very rarely does it take an average wait time to receive your meal. Get the flour tortillas-- the best in the metroplex and I say this with confidence! I mix the salsa verde with the red salsa and its like nothing other! Chunks of avocado take the flavor over the top. I've never had a bad meal or meal service. The wait staff is consistent-- must be a sign of good management. Margaritas arent slim on the alcohol. I always get the tacos de la casa, one beef one chicken and they are super fresh, never a disappointment. Try something different-- the menu is expansive!"}, {"review_id": "6n8CKR2mcFLj7edTf-YR7g", "user_id": "C-ijLdB6Ekt7XE8f5APsyg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/9/2016", "text": "This place was pretty hyped up.  Stopped by while in Norman.  Pretty crowded place during lunch.  Fast and friendly service.  I ordered the combo fajitas and my husband ordered the peruvian/chinese fried rice.  Fajitas were more on the oily side which had a glop of oil on the plate.  The fried rice was really taste, beautifully presented, but slightly salty.  The cook possibly added too much salt on top of the soy sauce.  No sopapillas during lunch, but maybe they were offer sopapillas?  I may consider stopping by to try their fish tacos!  Looked tasty when we saw our neighboring table order it."}, {"review_id": "Xd8l9DaO17gfCgcpDv9ppA", "user_id": "WaR-2C3WJDNOqe7bjm2xGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/2/2017", "text": "Great food, wonderful service and Margarita's that are strong, good and inexpensive.  We've had a dinner group that ranges from 5 to 8 folks that meets here EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT and wouldn't think of going anyplace else.  The Tex Mex is good but try some of the Peruvian dishes as they are delightful.  And the wait staff and owner as always so friendly and ready to serve.  I hate to let too many folks in on the secret but this by FAR the BEST Mexican (and Peruvian) food in the whole Metro Area.  Go and try it yourself and you will see MamaVeca's is the BEST!!"}, {"review_id": "2NMaH8onRL2k51rqMj6wIg", "user_id": "VgJmeW-uWIoatMnVbObkPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2017", "text": "Lengua quesadilla era genial!The best and most authentic Mexican food I've found in Norman!

The first spot we tried had an hour wait, but I called Mamaveca and they said a table could be ready for us by the time we got there. Yay!Upon arrival, our table was ready, but because of the hustle and bustle of the front area, it took a little while for us to be seated. Since it was my first visit, the lines to be seated as opposed to checking out were very unapparent. By the time we were seated, it took a good 10 minutes to get our drinks which were mostly waters. We did however get our chips, salsa and queso almost immediately. I was slightly disappointed with my entree. It was a pork verde and the meat simply wasn't very good. It's like they were covering up the dryness of the meat with the salsa verde and it didn't work too well. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their dishes, so perhaps it was just me, but it wasn't enticing enough for me to want to return. That is unless I find myself in a similar situation I was in that night!"}, {"review_id": "Lz8qz3cvckStN1ExZZG-YQ", "user_id": "pF9iuXtKD4azs-_jVMwoxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2016", "text": "I have found the Holy Grail of Mexican and Peruvian food in Oklahoma! Everything was absolutely perfect! From the second I walked in until the second I left. My waiter Carlos was outstanding. Very attentive and helpful with my entree selection and my beer mug was never empty. Now for the best part.... I had the Arroz Con Mariscos (Peruvian Paella). It was awsome. I live out by Choctaw but I will make a special trip down there again real soon just for that dish. My friend (Eduardo) had the number 17 tacos and he said they were the best he had ever had. Well besides the ones he makes. So if you are in the mood for a great Mexican or Peruvian dinner stop by and enjoy a great dining experience.Overall grade... A+.

The sides are good. I've tried the rice, re fried beans, the Mexican mashed potatoes and the Mexican cream corn.

I'm so flipping glad you clicked on this review because I would like to tell you about a place where the beer flows like wine. A place where the women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. A little place called.....Mamavecas. OK SO- this ain't just a tex mex place with the usual stuff. It has a strong Peruvian influence with more than a handful of authentic dishes. You can get an enchilada. Or you can get some real deal ceviche. Listen my dear buddy, this place is so legit, esp for Norman, OK. I don't know how I hadn't been encouraged to try it yet!Ambiance/service- way better than Tarahumaras. This place doesn't rush you in and out like cattle. We had the same waiter the entire time who actually cared about how we were doing. Quieter and less frenetic than Tara's. I think this is a much more pleasant dining experience. Decor is...very standard. Free salsa and queso cheese dip. Queso was pretty standard. Salsa was great, with a smoky flavor. Not too hot. In fact, not very hot at all, which is fine by me. Salsa is above average. My wife and mom were each pleased with their Tex Mex dishes. I tried a bite of the sour cream chicken enchiladas and they were above average. I had the picante camarones with yuca, a Peruvian dish. This. Was.  Awesome. I loved it. Pretty presentation, enough shrimp, cooked perfectly. The sauce was almost a cream sauce but not quite. I could have used a touch more heat in it; the heat was more a chili powder type heat than a habanero type heat. I'll dream of this dish and will be back again and again. Sorry Tarahumuara's, you've been fun, but I've met someone else. Someone I can see a real future with, and not just go through the paces with you because my friends think it's a good idea. Mamaveca's FTW!!!!"}, {"review_id": "MXRjsJ0VDZwt7wtLrXpUGA", "user_id": "y0Krwsoy-_UVHKbz9R3dGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2017", "text": "Good Mexican food for the Norman area.  Live in Texas but will be back next time in town."}, {"review_id": "K2_IfG6OVtKyFRUJ8rPOog", "user_id": "-hOyGBa28UZMrXCS5GW5vA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2016", "text": "We love Mamaveca's!Atmosphere:I like the atmosphere!  It's very cute and fun. I like that they try to incorporate the Peruvian culture. There's even these two alpaca or llama stuffed animals with a panda mural thing which is weird but fun. My boyfriend and I love hole-in-the-walls, but Mamaveca's is kinda in between this and a restaurant. Service:I hate to say that we were those people that came less than an hour before closing, but we were. Nonetheless, the service was great. As soon as you sit down you are given complimentary chips, salsa, and queso. Our waitress was nice, but her English wasn't very strong so it was a little hard for her to describe or answer our questions. We didn't mind though. The food was brought to us very fast! Even though the food was prepared fast, it was plated and presented very nicely! Food:So the chips are amazing. I personally prefer thin and airy chips rather than thick chips. The chips were served warm; they could've been a touch hotter for my taste but I didn't care because they were really good! The salsa is great! Okay, the queso was good for complimentary queso. I personally think their comp. queso is better than Ted's or the Tarahuwhatever place. Ps. My boyfriend asked for the flour tortillas and he really liked them. For our meals we ordered the #33: Burrito Supreme (beef) and the #58: Tacos de Pescado. The Burrito Supreme was so good! The beef is just the star of this dish. It was good quality beef! I definitely recommend this burrito! The Tacos de Pescado was very good as well! The fish is prepared right and pairs great with the grilled onions. The tortilla is very tasty, and you can tell they are fresh and homemade. I would definitely recommend adding lime juice to these tacos. Both of the dishes come with a good portion of rice, beans, and guacamole. The beans are good for refried beans. The guacamole is actually really tasty. I also appreciate that they give you a good portion of guacamole unlike most places! The rice was probably the least favorable food of the meal. It's not seasoned very well and it was a little cold on our plates. We still ate it though. The tacos also come with A good portion of fresh Pico de Gallo (big plus). We ate so much because the food was so good that we turned down the complimentary Sopapillas, maybe next time.Overall:We are so happy we found Mamaveca's! We have had he hardest time finding a Mexican restaurant we liked in Oklahoma! There's Los Cabos, but that's all the way in Tulsa. We have tried all of the other Mexican restaurants like Ted's, the Big Taco Truck, and Tarahumara's and we were never satisfied. Like they are alright. But Mamaveca's is actually good! We actually enjoyed our food! Now we will always go to Mamaveca's when craving Mexican food ;-)"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mamaveca-mexican-and-peruvian-restaurant-norman?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
