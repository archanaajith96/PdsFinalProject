We arrived for brunch the Sat before Easter, almost all 13 of us. We were pleasantly greeted & seated within 30 min (they do not take reservations). Impressed already? :) The server was happy to have us and they did not seem to mind delaying ordering while we awaited some late arrivals. While we conversed, our server was attentive and kept our drinks full.We ordered and that's where this place shines. ALL of our food came out at the SAME TIME! It was gorgeous, delicious, & expertly prepared. Plates were cleared promptly and no one seemed to mind when I karate chopped a mimosa. Hahahahaha. This place is worth every penny and I am now a dedicated customer! Go there! You will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "WW5xpyWx9RDXn7twXsvEEQ", "user_id": "VVi-5Eozc1m6YYfbIiW63g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "It's my new found favorite breakfast place. I have driven by many times and not given it a second thought. While searching yelp for a new place to go for breakfast I came across Altea's Eatery.  Going there was not a mistake. The Crepes are amazing and the omelettes are perfection. I had a few mimosas with breakfast and they did not disappoint. Wait staff were efficient, fast, and very friendly. Food arrived a lot sooner than I thought it would.   This is definitely going to be my \"go to\" breakfast place."}, {"review_id": "pdH7FEgQIqd-kMwwDsyNqw", "user_id": "wQ_eN4z_swwWJKomxCuQ4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Great place for brunch on a Sunday morning! We arrived around 11am and had about a 25 min wait which was not bad considering we had five people in our group. Our server was Ken, and he was very friendly and made a great recommendation to us when three of us ordered mimosas. He suggested we order the bucket of bubbly (pictured) which came with three juice choices.   They had a good amount of food choices, and even had gluten free options which was great, because one of our friends is gluten sensitive. I ordered Altea's Eggs Benedict, and added a side of bacon, my husband ordered the Savory Crepe with a side of potatoes, our friends ordered the Monsieur Omelet, the Braised Short Rib Omelet, and the Brunch Burger.      Everything came out in a timely manner and was delicious! We were definitely happy with our choices, and service. The restaurant is very clean, and quaint, but there is not a parking lot for the actual restaurant.       We will definitely add this to our places to return to when we are in the Worcester area."}, {"review_id": "pBpSvmy-duWuKzfZo9IK8A", "user_id": "vcf00WMylkdTdAzqOPC-2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "I stopped in with my wife and daughter on a Sunday for brunch and everything was excellent. I had the brunch burger and fries which was awesome. My wife loved the apple crepes. Even the kids menu chicken fingers were hand breaded pieces of chicken. Everything was cheap too. The burger was the most expensive thing we ordered and it was only $12. The restaurant was super clean and nice inside as well.

What's better than getting to sleep in AND still enjoy a delicious fusion of breakfast & lunch foods? Not to mention: MIMOSAS.We visited for a Saturday brunch, the day before Christmas eve, in a group of four. It was pretty packed, so we were pretty lucky to get seated as soon as we entered (especially since it was soooo cold outside so waiting would have sucked!). The vibe here is very French inspired, which I thought was lovely. The noise level wasn't that bad either, for nearly every table being used. Our waiter was nice, but I could tell he was a little stressed from how many people there were, so I'll give him a pass on that. I ordered the pressed chicken panini with an orange mimosa. It was absolutely delicious! It came with a side of fries, which I looooved. They're skinny cut, and were the perfect complement to my sandwich. I don't know if it's the chipotle aioli they used in this panini or what but it was quite tasty! It tasted fresh, hot out of the oven, and was the perfect size for brunch. I was a little disappointed in the mimosa - it tasted too watered down. It was a general consensus throughout the table that everyone enjoyed their food - I definitely want to come back and try their beignets! Parking can be difficult, so be sure to come early if you want to get a spot in front of the restaurant."}, {"review_id": "R7sv1o6hAEHIvOk62u15MQ", "user_id": "zF0wuFMzEm7nZuBZ_WsQ5g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/9/2017", "text": "I love going here for breakfast. Seems like I always get the same thing, I promise to try something else next time. Service is always welcoming and efficient. Environment is open and clean. Menu has both breakfast and brunch!Eggs Benedict: I always get this cause I'm obsessed with eggs Benedicts. But it has a great flavor balance. A teensy bit too lemony for me, but that doesn't stop me from wiping the plate clean. The potatoes here are my favorite. They're soft and flavorful, just how I like them. It is a big meal, so prepare for leftovers if you have a small stomach. Granola: I get basically the \"parfait\" on the menu. The granola is deliciously crispy/crunchy (but not too hard). The fruit (usually strawberry) tastes wonderful mixed with the Greek yogurt and granola. This is very refreshing and makes me feel healthy, haha. Banana French Toast: Amazing. The french toast is fluffy and a little crisp on the outside. It is smothered with flavor on top, and the banana is cooked perfectly."}, {"review_id": "wGZHAezIRegDe2MkR4Qecg", "user_id": "5KuG4w0OkCL9_Jl_eQZSuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Great food and clean bright atmosphere.

Maybe it was the wonderful mango mimosa or Bloody Mary I indulged in, but I seriously liked my food and my experience. Ken was. attentive but not overly so for our late lunch.

The French Toast was also very good, although it was a bit overwhelmed with blueberries. The brunch burger was the highlight! Alarmingly good. Super greasy, so be prepared to go through a napkin or two, but maybe that's why it was so good. Whatever the reason, it really was amazing. All around good experience.

With more of a Parisian/French café theme, Altea's offers impressive omelets, Panini's, and crepes alike. My personal favorite would be the grilled vegetable omelet and of course, the Nutella crepes. And of course -- no Altea's/Livia's experience would be complete without one of their flavorful mimosas!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/alteas-eatery-worcester-3?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
