Small, independent restaurant that sits in the heart of Old Colorado City, this place serves perfect comfort/diner food.I had the open-faced roast beef on Texas toast - simply awesome. A little bit of a wait in a somewhat crowded waiting area, but the overall service was friendly, attentive and efficient.Tara was our server and she rocked the patio!"}, {"review_id": "GbIh4fBidIWk4Vnn89IQBw", "user_id": "zAUdqBxiyjOS2MzAxdLAew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "The first thing I saw upon entering this house that has been turned into a restaurant was a sign specifying the cinnamon roll policy - always a good sign that they had to outline rules to keep the cinnamon roll consumption under control. Probably because they are the size of a basketball and one of the best I've ever had. So tender with plenty of cinnamon on the inside and what must have been cinnamon icing on top. We had that as an appetizer (because at breakfast, cinnamon rolls are indeed appetizers) before digging into the main meal. I sampled a bit of everything my tablemates were eating, and was very pleased with the biscuits (soft on the inside, delicate crust on the outside, slight tang to the dough), jam (homemade, stellar), as well as everything else that hit the table. I ordered the green chile omelet and inhaled the whole thing - tasty chile sauce with spicy chorizo - and even got a pancake on the side that rocked my world.Although there was a line, this place has quick service so we didn't wait long. The staff was all very friendly and helpful, and the fact that this place is actually in a house made it all the more \"homey.\""}, {"review_id": "GnVlt8wnQBjWfGFwmzOQ-Q", "user_id": "K4LQF-xJji-8fueyxZHL3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Came in because we were looking for a DDD restaurant and because it had some great reviews.

Tara was awesome today and was super attentive with our table. All of the other servers were great as well, always stopping by to see if we were doing alright and if we needed a refill on drinks or if we needed anything else. Getting food out is a little slow but what can you expect from a place that makes everything fresh for dozens of people at one time?

Once seated we had coffee and menus in front of us immediately. Our server was friendly and attentive, the food came out much faster than I expected, given how busy it was. Both our breakfasts were served hot and delicious. I had biscuits, sausage gravy, eggs and hash browns.

I went the morning of my birthday and when I ordered one of their delicious mimosas, the waitress said happy birthday after seeing my ID. By the time I left, I felt every member of the staff at some point dropped in a happy Birthday wish...how lovingly in that!!The food was unfortunately about average. The omelettes were a little on the small size compared to an average dish.  I will say that getting a small pancake for the same price of toast was awesome to get a taste. Very fluffy and fresh caked .  If you have to wait during the winter, the lobby is very small and yields enough space for maybe 15 people which forced us to wait briefly outside or you could go to your car as others did Thank for the birthday love and look forward to coming back much earlier next tim to try a cinnamon roll"}, {"review_id": "jG7cim6gbpPz4Wpx-4X-AA", "user_id": "_pljKqjwvted59cy9QzkMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Logan is a peach, I don't understand how someone of her caliber is still only a busser.

She said the veggie burger was less than remarkable (I get it; mastering the veg burger is truly a scientific matter). I feel for her, because the joint obviously has legit foodie bona fides, which were lost upon her even with those o-rings.She also missed out on the deliciously gazpacho heft of their house-made Bloody Mary. Honestly, I can't complain about my Sunday brunch at all, but it wasn't a \"WOWSER!\" spot that others have been for me. For this reason, though there's nothing to scowl about, I give it 4-not-5 stars."}, {"review_id": "jccJf5N6VK_zmvwMf15nnw", "user_id": "iXHnBfY9dKhL_UbfUwVAeA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Delicious food and the staff is wonderful!!

Colorado next to Blunt Mortuary, this place is a little gem. While we didn't get here early enough to catch the Cinnamon bun they're famous for, our breakfast was great and our server, Logan, was fantastic. People make all the difference in the service industry and she was a great server. The home made Jelly is out of this world as I bathed my sourdough bread in it and couldn't get enough. I should have ordered the Chicken Fried steak over the Corned Beef hash omelette but there's always next time. Check this spot out!

Based on a friends recommendation we ate here and had a fairly good experience. The service was top notch and although they were very busy, we had drinks when we needed them and our food arrived as ordered. The best thing in my opinion are the cinnamon rolls (come early as they sell out) and the pancakes were very good. Most everyone in our party enjoyed what they ordered. Also the Bloody Mary mix is made in house and worth trying as well. My major gripe was the chorizo green chili was a little light on the chorizo.

Although the service was awesome, the food was mediocre at best. Their claim to fame is the huge cinnamon roll which was, in fact, huge, but the frosting was overly sweet, cold, and gritty. The hot green chili was not remotely hot and everything seemed processed.  Also, although it's not the restaurant's fault, the young girl sitting next to us kept hitting her baby on the head and yelling at him any time he did anything during the entire meal. She was more annoying than her baby that did that annoying scream. The hostess came over and commented to them about the screaming but went overboard about it. Just based on the food though, we would not go back."}, {"review_id": "4RI2WT1TeRgYzf5PDTSDqQ", "user_id": "GIQaAyM7xLRK7mAcm9u5hw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "This place is so cute and homey.
