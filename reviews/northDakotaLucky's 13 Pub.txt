The outside parking lot was packed and the overflow on the curb was full but there was no wait for a table for three. We were immediately seated at a booth and our waitress was attentive and constantly checked on us. I had the Korean tacos, my wife had the walleye spring roll and my brother in law had the monte crisco. All our food came out amazing. We had three beers as well. They have a full bar. Overall impression was great. Nice place for a quick bite, relaxed atmosphere and killer service. I've been here before for brunch and it was just as good."}, {"review_id": "jOLZ1S1-y_Wrwdvv7lf8WA", "user_id": "FUKCSpxualeZSsXN9YOlKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I've eaten here twice and thought it was good both times. I love walleye, so the first time I ordered the blackened walleye. The second time I ordered the fried walleye. I liked them both, but the fried one could have been more crispy. I'm on the verge of giving it 5 stars, but the price is a bit high for the dinner portion. However, this is one of the best places in town to get walleye. I will recommend it to friends and family!"}, {"review_id": "lLADUGMW_2gjgdQHmgP3aw", "user_id": "4MCemZet-mmfunhSqEdyEQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/5/2017", "text": "Worst turkey sandwich ever!Service was ok but I thought getting one of the \"signature\" sandwiches would be a good idea, I was wrong!Much like the movie this meat was fed through a wood chipper. Unlike the movie this is so they can use every inch of meat on the turkey which is fine but how about mix it in. There wasn't one piece of meat larger than my fingernail. It was odd too because half of it was actually under the sandwich, not between the bun. All I can figure is 1- cooks have never been taught how to build a sandwich and 2- they just didn't give a shit. Not worth the money, that is very clear!KT"}, {"review_id": "we-j-qJDVHvuEe0uPMK4Dg", "user_id": "CUCpCWZe_4CF01UGxJR_dg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Had the Inferno burger and upgraded to the stuffed tots[could have been better].

He was on point. Buffalo sauce was on excellent with the right balance of flavor and heatSlow poured a Guinness to boot. Look froward to trying a full plate. UPDATE:  Retuned next day for dinner. 2 men, two 17 YO boys.  Ordered 3 different sandwiches and Walleye. Two sandwiches went unfinished - they were very generous portions. Everyone really enjoyed the meals. Items to note: sandwiches were stacked high. Coleslaw tasted very fresh. Who doesn't like complimentary popcorn while waiting?  Didn't eat dessert, but a few passed by...  they were presented well.

Told it would be a 10 minute wait for 2 people. While waiting, I counted 10 open tables. We waited nearly 15 min to get seated. They seem more interested in accommodating bigger groups.

Food is overpriced for bar food, but they have an extensive menu with tons of different options. There are other options in town for bar food that isn't quite as expensive, but it's fun on game day and Saturday's for bingo! If you don't mind spending the money, I'd recommend the walleye fingers, loaded tots and sweet potato fries to accompany their burgers.
