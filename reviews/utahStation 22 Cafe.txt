The food was really good. You have to try the beer battered fries, they have that nailed. The fry sauce was awesome.

We had the fried cookie dough & some root beers! The root beer was all the rave, but I thought it was just okay. Nothing special. The fried cookie dough however, was really good!

The reason I give 3 out of stars is because they made us wait to be seated until our entire party arrived, which was a grand whopping total of 4 people  Two of us were already there..."}, {"review_id": "NAQ0puI7myVH5eAadSFA-A", "user_id": "mp97f8V_6rx4Xep0fDBmfg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "In town for a quick appointment with one of our patients and meet with one of our distributors.

While the service was more friendly than before, it was extremely slow. Someone that was seated after us had his food and had finished before we got our food.Food quality was not as good and really just meh. I probably wouldn't come back after this visit. It's taken me a while to get here but I finally made it and was overall pleased with the experience. It's definitely a bit of a hipster eatery. The decor was unexpected but seemed to work. Food was good. We had chicken and waffles and grown up Mac and cheese. It's  not going to rate as the best thing I've ever eaten but I would definitely come here again. I've heard good things about the burgers as well. Biggest thing I would change is the friendliness of service. Could definitely use a notch or two up."}, {"review_id": "vcElBOHwvGIog3iS9JwnHQ", "user_id": "X21EqZtkxlerVpJkpuJtNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "HOLY COW.

At least 40 people left because of the long waits. It seems that they were just trying to get food quickly to the customers that actually waited for a table. The food was pretty good. We loved the fries. The burger I had (a burger with an onion ring and pulled pork) had great flavors, but the bun and onion ring were a bit soggy. My husband really enjoyed his jack carawack (sp?). The sodas are really fun too!

I tried the \"Pig & Cheese\" sandwich with a cup of tomato soup.  The sandwich is best described as a grilled cheese meets pulled pork with grilled apples. It was expertly made. Plenty of meat, but enough cheddar cheese and Apple (tart)to compliment the pork. They even used some cheese on the outside of the bread to add flavor and a lasting crispness to the bread. I'm stealing this idea for home.The soup was really good. I'm not usually a soup guy, but couldn't resist the cheese & tomato soup combo. There's a reason it's a classic. It wasn't from a can. I assumed it was house made and the server confirmed it for me. It was thick and creamy with a wonderful tomato taste. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Provo."}, {"review_id": "UE84RzAdMfSXG5YbAUZXJg", "user_id": "aPGlGkZtw26QyCrPnzN8zA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "If you are preparing to put up with some of the absolute worst service on planet earth, you will probably really enjoy the food.

Maybe that was my problem. I ordered the Golden Griller with a side of tomato soup and my friend ordered the Grown Up Mac & Cheese. Both were very rich. Definitely delicious, but... lacking something. I left with a nauseous stomach and the distinct impression that I didn't want to go back. The service was slow and the restaurant was loud.

The variety of soda is cool, but they didn't carry anything World Market doesn't have. I got the poutine, it was good, but also cheese and gravy and potatoes is hard to mess up. My friend got the chicken and waffles and not sure why everyone thinks they are amazing? The chicken and flavor was good, but the waffle was soggy! Who likes soggy waffles? The server was super nice and attentive. The decor was definitely hipster.

We were of course ready to order but she left without taking our order and came back 15 minutes later to take our order. She never came back to fill up our waters or see how we're doing. We had to go to her to get our checks after sitting there for so long. When I walked over to find her, her and the other waiter were standing by the register talking.

If you have over 2-4 people don't even bother, they won't accommodate groups or do they want to 2. If you still want to brave it, then don't tell the hostess you have more than 4 people because they'll tell you that due to fire hazards hey only have one table to accommodate you3.
