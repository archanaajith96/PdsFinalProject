I ordered two traditional gyro combos. It's a good portion of food for $9-ish dollars! The gyro itself was fantastic and the fries were nice and hot. I also ordered two pieces of baklava but my husband and I haven't tried that yet... we are still stuffed from the gyro and fries."}, {"review_id": "Wz9YfJ6kVpt-7cRmFQuwWQ", "user_id": "RM_QAm-KfxG85MD952Ov_Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Like most places that serve food, the customer service is terrible. Our order was taken in the drive-thru by a guy who apparently laughing hysterically before he hit the mic and couldn't compose himself while taking our order. We arrived at the window to witness the following.:I gave my credit card to the guy who took our order and was immediately given our drinks. A minute later, he gave me my card back and said my food would be ready soon. A few moments later, a big guy came to the window and said \"Let me get that card again.\" He said it was declined due to my card being expired, yet my card doesn't expire until September next year. He attempted to run the card again and the said he was going to type it in. To me, that sounds a bit fishy, so I will be monitoring my account closely. The time previously we ate hear, we dined in. During the half hour we were there, we were stared at by the young teenage girl who took our order. No kidding, the whole time we were eating, stared at. I suggest going in with cash and ordering to go so you came watch food being made and not having to deal with a credit card.Other than the service, the food is great!"}, {"review_id": "sf9UDMK7ZzciBTiPgMG3Qw", "user_id": "AYlDx1Y8m7Ap3wLou6xkag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "Great food.

Clean restaurant and my Gyro was delicious with nicely seasoned tender meat. This place is pretty cheap for how much food you get. Drive-Through is a plus for the busy person on the go. I have been back to this location a few more times after my first visit and nothing has changed, still great.

I have already been back twice since this visit. I highly recommend giving it a try and your mouth will never eat a sub par gyro again. The menu is small, but I haven't had a bad gyro yet. The only weird thing is they put fries in their gyros which is odd to me but it works. Parking is rough to get at their restaurant, but the drive through is efficient."}, {"review_id": "gH_MhjkJ1ioRHn6chgEOaw", "user_id": "0fmYjn804ex7Yy5hkI6Drw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "This place has such a good Greek salad that I keep coming back for. The salad comes with a Greek dressing, mixed lettuce, kalamata olives, red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, feta, and banana peppers with a side of pita. You have a choice of meats to add on as well. I prefer no meat and it is still very filling and full of flavor."}, {"review_id": "2WeQXll2eiWD_k8oAAwZlw", "user_id": "LUiJUW9AnWtfTmAtTCmUPw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Fast and friendly staff, clean environment, and the food as good.

Pita was very soft and fluffy. Falafels weren't great but definitely one of the good ones.

They do have a drive through though which makes things very easy. The meals are all under 10 bucks.The food is worth everything though. Iv only had the beef gyroz so far but I can say with confidence the meat alone is so amazing. The bread is so soft and holds the meat perfectly and the onions and other condiments are all so fresh. I highly suggest this place over an fast food as it comes out just as fast. I got my order almost instantly which is amazing. You can also see their kitchen which is very clean. I recommend this place highly."}, {"review_id": "uuUvaFqO7Dcx06PV6XbiYA", "user_id": "AXSGiBGmjxXypAWBQAGxPQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "I love this place. They are always fast, friendly and the food is so freaking delicious. It's menu is short, simple, and easy to decipher. I have never been disappointed by the food or service here. I go through phases where I can eat here once a week without complaint. The portions are perfectly filling to me, sometimes finishing just the gyro without the side of fries is a challenge. Highly recommend stopping by if you're in the area and are craving a quick gyro, and deliciously cooked - perfectly seasoned fries."}, {"review_id": "5qgOFDtz2K3Hj6q4fhC7tg", "user_id": "U9ywtX3ynA3Ku4ZJzMnE7g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "My server's name was cash my station number was 5 order number 77236 customer name Mike ordered combination number one paid $8.91 the food that I got was lukewarm had no heat to it the meat was seemingly dry it didn't hold an ounce of grease I requested a refund because after swallow in the first buy it I couldn't get the sandwich down nor lost taste and appetite was denied a refund because it's the boss's policy not to issue refunds on subpar food served to their customers the cashier was wearing a NO hat.
