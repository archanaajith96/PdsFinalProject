Tonight a little lower. Must have been an off night.   In fact given the price, Texas Roadhouse May have been a better choice. Martinis were top notch. However wife's had to be remade as waiter spotted a floater. I ordered the MT Veder which is an excellent Cab. They were out so went for the house Malbec which was good Starters. Wife had the portobello and I had the blue cheese lettuce wedge.  The portobello except for one went home to doggles. Looked and tasted like something from Sams.   Wedge was good but a little shy on crumbs and heavy on dressing.   Bread which was usually excellent was cold. Would have ask for a replacement but waiter did not return until the entire. Steaks were well prepared and flavorful.  However comparing the bone in rib eye at TX Roadhouse with the rib eye here they were similar.  The service usually makes up for the difference, but it was an off night. The saving of this visit was dessert. The  Apple Crisp was excellent when accompanied by a fine glass of port.  We will probably return given past history."}, {"review_id": "D1rrXO1AQPAH0dKCZGEC4g", "user_id": "zgsO2vKlkVJo2SDrgDV8lA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "This was a surprising dinner, everything is done very well.  You need to know it's a little pricey but what they offer was all top shelf items at a decent price.I sat at the bar which is small but has a good feel to it, I let the bartender know I wasn't every hungry(I wish I would of been starving) so he made some suggestions that where spot on.I ordered the 2/3oz filet medallions with candied bacon(steak was very very good) but the bacon stole the show.  I started with a half wedge salad with homemade bleu cheese dressing.  The side that came out with it was loaded baked potato can't miss. I will say this the side items the have are worth paying for, they don't skimp on size.I looked over menu and was really impressed, blue point oysters, king crab legs, and lobster tail.  If you wanted a seafood dinner they had all the right items.  Wish I was I town longer I would definitely eat here tomorrow."}, {"review_id": "hum5pkul3JpN8pvP0pHFBg", "user_id": "nr35WjC-YI0dFcsnW33Szw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Been here mostly for drinks and apps, but I finally came for a proper dinner after another dinner event.This is probably one of the best if not the best steak house in the area. As much as I love my hole in the walls, the atmosphere matters for certain occasions. If you have a business dinner or you just want a steak, come here. They have a private event room for 10-100 people. This is also the same group that operates Black Sheep and Touch. I think Flame is probably the best of the bunch, different, but the best. Things to Note:1) Service is impeccable. I have never not had someone not knowledgeable about drinks or food.2) Downstairs (The Redroom/Happy Hour (4-6pm) is more casual)3) Open Late or will say Open4) From the KC Strip to the Filet Medallions, u come here for a steak5) Pass on the Chicken or Fish or Oysters. It's not their Forte and the New Englander in me can't force myself to eat oysters outside of the Coasts. Although, the fried one is ok. I guess if you fry anything, it will work. 6) Wish their were more options on sides besides a potato  and some basic steamed broccoli. 7) I really like the garbage salad with tenderloin - but they should change the name to make it more appetizing.Great spot downtown for dinner, a proper made manhattan cocktail, and a good wine selection."}, {"review_id": "E8QjLDcKsYglD7gO9gdNoQ", "user_id": "KgDtoAvntrW45_F9iWF41Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "If you're looking for a dining experience in which even the most minuscule details are tended with an abundance of care and an urge to elevate, search no further. Flame is the place for you.Not only are the entrees and ambiance perpetually on point, even oft-neglected side dishes are given superstar treatment within the walls of this establishment. There simply are no mundane or ill-prepared items on the menu, and although the cost of the meal will certainly reflect the chef's enthusiasm, the check will seem trivial compared to the transcendent, well-balanced flavors of the meal.And unlike many higher-end eateries, the portion sizes at Flame are all more than generous - to the extent that even my starving party of four took home to-go boxes filled with the parts of their meal they simply couldn't finish.I could go on, but mere words cannot hope to capture the wonder of dining here - it has to be experienced in person. I suggest doing so sooner than later."}, {"review_id": "5az3HHWpNqY3VhGIX-iuQQ", "user_id": "4qrLHtOHcO-2bDoz7WUSVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "This is a first class steakhouse for Springfield, and located on the west side of downtown.We started with a couple of Grey Goose Martini's and that set the pace.  Ordered the Caesar Salad and 8oz Filet.  The salad was large enough to share, and the steak was aged, cooked to perfection, tender, and very delicious.  Being a busy Friday evening, we were unable to make reservations in the main dining area.  But downstairs in the Red Room Lounge, we were seated immediately with full menu service.The entire menu sounds awesome, and I would highly recommend Flame for your next meal!"}, {"review_id": "1v9BOiHqQT3FwBTbv_akkg", "user_id": "Yy5uYBI7PH5fVtfQjYI76Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/15/2017", "text": "Hosted a business dinner at Flame last night. The food is first rate, on par with what you'd expect for an upscale steakhouse.We opted to be seated in the downstairs bar, for a more casual environment.  Our server, on her first nite solo, did a phenomenal job of keeping the glasses full and the service prompt. We did our best to rattle her with special requests, but she handled it all professionally and with a smile.I opted for the KC strip, with steamed broccoli on the side. The steak was scrumptious, cooked to medium rate perfection, 16 ounces of nicely marbled beef, butter tender, with a tasty char on the outside. Presentation is on a hot white plate, simplistic and elegant. Broccoli was served in a crock, steamed bright green, slightly crunchy and seasoned with lemon. An excellent accompaniment and a portion large enough for two. Because no dinner is complete without dessert, I had to try a slice of NY-style cheesecake. This was excellent (and house made). Smooth and creamy, with a granola crust, served with a raspberry sauce and topped with a fresh strawberry. A great end to a great meal. Dinner is expensive here, my tab was $100 including one glass of wine. Still, an excellent, upscale meal. Next time I'm in town, I'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "OyXz_44pSIBQt4KTFBH8og", "user_id": "yt2aONuVTbjCALODFupCdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "We love eating at the Flame. Last night I had the 16 oz toploin and my husband had the 14 oz ribeye. Both cuts are great. In fact, the toploin is my go-to steak of choice because it is always good and is their cheaper cut (at 29ish dollars, I think it is just as good as some of their more expensive cuts). You get a side with your meat, so your choice of potato. I love their fries as a side and they bring out a smoked ketchup with it that is tasty. We've been several times and have had almost all of the potato options. My husband likes the twice baked potato and the baked potato. For the baked potato they bring by a cart for you to fancy up your spud. We  have always liked getting either the asparagus or creamed spinach and splitting it with our steaks and potatoes. Last night we just went with steaks and potatoes because everybody is entitled to skip the greens every once and awhile. I've had their Manhattan (super good!) before and we enjoy their house wines. The Flame has a nice product and we enjoy the ambiance and the overall experience of eating here. It is pricey, but worth it for a nice night out or a special occasion."}, {"review_id": "sfH-uyFkJ24slvDkyGyS9Q", "user_id": "OAhE6C90QMTLIC9kAEzY8A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "The worst steak outside of bonanza I have ever had.

They were crisp on the outside and served with a crumbled bacon and melted blue cheese on the side.For entrees, we ordered a Filet and Ribeye- both of which were delicious and ample quantity with a small side and/or salad.Plenty of parking in the area, friendly service and staff, and I look forward to our next visit!"}, {"review_id": "SkrFTYXcB1SzrullOnOylw", "user_id": "tU4NbWez-eEriTE2knJ2DQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Best steak everrr!

We went down a spiral staircase into a lounge and were immediately seated. Roxanne was our server and immediately asked us what we would like to drink. Two ice cold Martinis were quickly served up and we enjoyed the cocktail hour. My husband and father in law ordered a Caesar salad and filet and I ordered the tomato salad and jumbo shrimp cocktail. The Caesar salad was huge! And the dressing was heavy w anchovy. My tomato and mozzarella salad was out of this world. We received new silver and our entrees arrived ~delicious!!! Steaks were cooked perfectly and the shrimp were large and perfectly chilled. An excellent meal!!!! Roxanne quickly boxed up my father in laws extras and we were on our way home.

Flame is wanting to be a premiere high end steakhouse for Springfield. With that goal comes great responsibility. A continued focus on the HIGHEST quality of product and execution. Execution by both front and back of the house.Upon entering the hostess stand is controlled by 1 person. The hostess is one of the more important positions in a successful restaurant. This position provides the first impression of the dining experience. First impressions can be difficult to recover from. As I entered the restaurant the hostess was on the phone and no recognition of my presence was provided until she got off the phone a couple of minutes later. An attempt to seat me at the bar for my dining experience was provided. Not my cup of tea if I'm going to spend $70+ for my meal. I was accommodated when I asked to seat elsewhere. I was greeted a couple of minutes later and was asked if I wanted anything else to drink besides the water that was being provided. I enquired about a wine and a taste was provided. When inquiring about how long the wine had been opened the server wasn't sure but gave a best guess instead. I ordered my wine along with my entree choice.Salad - The wedge was served and oxidation (browning) was present. The plate used was room temp. The blue cheese dressing had no flavor of blue cheese. It's predominate flavor was sour cream (part base ingredient). The blue cheese crumble was light in flavor (which could indicate older product).Main Entree - The filet was cooked perfectly (medium rare) but over seasoned with salt which masked the delicate flavor a filet provides. The twice baked potato, although flavorful would have been much better if it was warmer.Dessert - Coffee was served at 116 degrees (160-170 is best serving temp 180 being brewing temp). Creme Brulee presented table side to be torched at the table is a nice showpiece for presentation but proper execution is important if table side service is provided. Unfortunately the turbinado sugar was not properly caramelized. I didn't enjoy chewing on turbinado crystals. There was NO sign of actual vanilla bean being used (most likely vanilla extract used) to make this custard dish.Overall the meal wasn't the best. The dining experience was ok. My constructive criticism was expressed to the floor manager who seemed appreciative of my observations and she stated she would pass my experience on to the chef. The bill was presented and was not accurate. I clearly stated to the manager that I wanted to pay for everything that I ordered as I didn't want anything comp'ed. I give constructive criticism for the improvement of the establishment and not to get anything in return. After having the server correct the bill, I paid and left. I was thanked on my way out thusly ending my experience.Overall \"Flame\" is a good restaurant but if they truly want to be a cut above, the entire staff needs to focus on providing the best quality of products and services available. I will go back and give them another try in the future."}, {"review_id": "WbZpqVFUCWacnhcbQO608g", "user_id": "2KfMecCRNpHKyW4uzGv44w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017", "text": "Top tier food!

Was able to get a reservation same day and inquired if it was kid friendly as I'd read from a previous review it was not. Friendly employee told me yes it was. Great! We were sat in the red room/basement. The atmosphere of the basement is more of a \"longe\" type setting. So I immediately think,  it good for kids. Since we were already there and given the time, we stayed. We ordered the escargot and muscles as an appetizer. The muscles were amazing! Escargot was rather salty, but we still enjoyed it. There was a rather large gap in the time out appetizers arrived and then when our dinner arrived. The service was just okay. For a $200+ meal, I would've liked better service. Dinner arrived, we had ribeye and filet and kids had the filet burgers with fries. Steak was cooked perfectly and good flavor but very very salty! Children had the same experience with their French fries to point they didn't eat them. When kids don't eat French fries, you know something must be up. After dinner we waited for our check for what felt like forever.
