Simon came from Delmar, Delaware, Seafort from Okeechobee Florida both made their home in Alaska escaping from the hell that was war.Simon had been injured in the civil war by sustaining a \"Forrest Gump\" in the Battle of Antietam, he was captured by the southerners where he met Seafort. Seafort betrayed his company and his duty because he fell in love with a handsome Yankee prisoner-of-war Simon. Seafort's desires were further complicated by the pleasure he feet when he saw a strong men bound and helpless (Seafort was small-built and envied larger men their strength) even though Seafort was by no means cruelly masochistic, and would never actually harm his lover. Simon's own feelings were complex in that although he was the stronger of the two, he longed to submit to someone he can trust, such as Seafort.Long story short, Seafort helped Simon escape from Johnsonville Prison, across the great plains, into Canada and finally, the pair entered Alaska panning for gold and love.Due to his damaged hindquarters, Simon often had to stay behind, and instead of prospecting stuck to cooking what little provisions the men had in their purses (I mean satchels.)As he was weaker, this naturally irritated Seafort as he needed his lover's strong back to pack their heavy equipment up and down the streams. This led to a couple's quarrel and things finally came to a head.Little is known about their quarrel, except for a poem which was etched into one of the S&S bathroom stalls.\"There are strange things done in the midnight sun by the men who moil for gold;The Arctic trails have their secret tales;That would make your blood run cold;The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,But the queerest they ever did see; Was the day Simon did cremate Seafort's Steak and cheese.\"As with most couples, the disagreement between the lovers over the preparation of food led to the deterioration of the feelings they once had for each other. Seafort had enough and decided to move to Ketchikan to work as one of Soapy Smith's high dollar corner girls. Simon, being unable to work, move, or otherwise do anything other than sit and cook was left alone in Southcentral Alaska by himself.Their love, their struggles, and the loss of losing Seafort drove Simon mad. Some say he died in Campbell Creek, but the real old timers say that he uttered a curse on the land that broke his heart, and died in a grave he dug by hand, under the site which is now Bean's Cafe, haunting the Anchorage Bowl forever.Simon and Seaforts is a restaurant built on the principle of their forbidden love, and in the spirit of Simon's efforts to please Seafort they too will cremate your Steak, Shrimp, Crab, or whatever else they can sell you. The restaurant figured out what our lovers never did, mineral extraction doesn't work in Alaska, but cooking overpriced meals for tourists; there is the State's true gold rush.For a hearty Alaskan meal that would have satisfied the insatiable hunger of Seafort I would recommend the Yukon Gold Potatoes, as it is the only gold that they did find on their journey to Alaska.Overall the atmosphere will remind you of an overpriced Saloon, where classy \"girls\" like Seafort could be found in turn of the century Ketchikan. The food is generally quite good, but expect to pay a good deal of cash for access into this most exquisite of saloons."}, {"review_id": "AMvRaDo6m20BEWerZzPQPQ", "user_id": "bpaxKB35JSur24z2C0kRYA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Our seafood dinner at Simon and Seafort's was excellent.

Menu looked very familiar so we did a little research and learned this place is owned by the same company that runs Kincaid's in Burlingame, CA, one of our favorite steaks joints in the Bay Area. Hubs had a spinach salad and a bowl of seafood chowder, I had my usual rock salt-encrusted prime rib. Delish as ever. For dessert, he got the creme brûlée and I got the chocolate indulgence cake. As fate would have it, there were lots of grad dinners going on at the same time, so we ended up eating at the bar. Although it was pretty crazy, service was excellent, and I have no idea how our waitress was able to stay as attentive as she was. Don't let the blah building exterior fool you (the physical building itself looks like a run down office building, with the restaurant taking up the ground floor), this place makes up for the drab exterior in spades!"}, {"review_id": "j6M4zviwtkOm9NxHKFJs3w", "user_id": "ctWAuzS04Xu0lke2Rop4lQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 - # 8/100One of the finer establishments in Anchorage. I remember my Dad taking me here in 1996 but then I was on a diet so all I had was a salad. I remember the view was breathtaking though. Fast forward 20 years later I took my mom, sister and son for lunch here and this time I ate to my heart's content. Their chocolate muffin was to die for. It came out piping hot, that butter just melted when I spread it on. No sharing of this treat. Even my sister who isn't much of a chocolate fan, finished hers. For starters we had the smoked salmon bisque and New England clam chowder. Both were good but of course the salmon came out ahead. We also had the salad, forgot the name but it was good. Sweet and tart it had strawberries, blueberries, pecans and blue cheese with a raspberry dressing. For the four of us we shared the beer batter fish and chips, Alaska seafood scramble and Simon's prime rib hash. It was more than enough food, we had leftovers. We didn't have room for dessert. Maybe next visit we'll order dessert for starters. The view is still breathtaking. Restroom was clean. Parking is free for the first 2 hours. Sadly we parked somewhere else but it was a good thing as we were able to walk off some of the calories we put in."}, {"review_id": "t3nuB2U5YE8Gww4Bk9fVjQ", "user_id": "BQLc7jSHfPXDvleNFJ6lyg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Stopped in for a drink and a view of the bay.

It's different from other cioppono since it has a grilled cod in the cod surrounded by a red sauce filled with clams, salmon, halibut, and shrimp. Wow, the broth was simply amazing and the fish were so delicious. It's definitely a #Thinsulin approved dish.

Not bad at all. Happy hour menu consisted of French dip sliders, steamer clams, sweet potato fries, chicken wings, crab artichoke dip. The regular line up but with better prices.  The highest price thing on menu was that classic sampler for 24, usually 36 at regular time.

Fantastic ocean view. I ordered steak with king crab legs, both awesome. It is not in the central area of downtown, but it is worth walking a little further to get better quality. It seems that most restaurants in Alaska have the same menu: steak, crab legs, salmon, other seafood, and combo. Hence, it is very important to choose the one with really good quality.Btw. My only complain is the dessert. I ordered Baked Alaska recommended by the waiter. OMG, that was the sweetest thing that I ever cried over!

Even on a Sunday night this place was hopping and service was definitely on the slow side the entire night. The menu is large and offers many good entree options. Prices are starting to near ridiculous levels however with many dishes in the $30 range for smallish portions. Everyone in our party did enjoy their dinners and cocktails, although it was pretty smokey since the kitchen is close by and open air. I think this place also has more appeal in the months with more daylight as you get a great view, but this time of year it's like sitting in an Applebee's in a strip mall.

The seafood prep is fresh and well prepared.  Don't miss this. The king crab legs... Spend. The.

They have a bit of items on both the food and drink menu to choose from. I found their habanero mojito to be especially refreshing. As for the HH items we ordered the run of the mill deep fried calamari, mussels and clams in broth, prime rib sliders, artichoke & crab dip.  My buddy and I did order additional items off their regular menu since we were still a bit hungry after finishing our HH food.I went with their daily special of halibut over green peas and sprinkled king crab meat. This was a true disappointment. I found the fish bland and the smashed green peas/carbs mixture to look and taste like baby food. I felt like they just threw in a bunch of random ingredients together to come up with this.  I definitely made a mistake ordering this but I finished it anyway. I could've cooked a better halibut in Seattle!My buddy ordered their colossal king crab leg from the Berants Sea. It is a single massive crab leg served with drawn butter. He found it quite filling albeit pricey. Overall, I was disappointed with my particular entree and the HH items had zero standouts. Our waitress was attentive and personable so that was a plus.
