Chris was our waitress and she was unbelievable. The price point for food was really good. The sangria and wine price point was outstanding. The chicken parm was very good. The sauce was very good. The shrimp parm was ok. Pasta was cooked perfectly.  Will absolutely go back again.

I craved it so bad during a pregnancy 16 years ago that one of my sister's went to them over 16 years ago and explained how much I wanted their chicken park that the lady who helped her sent everything wrapped separately so that my sister could travel with it and keep it fresh for me!!

It's the eve of the NYC Marathon and I wanted pasta but something more than just pasta. I chose the Filet of Salmon Marechiara. I did not know it came with clams and mussels so that was my first experience with those food items. The linguini was delicious. I ate slowly and carefully but I could not quite control sporadic sauce splatter. The waiters, who are mostly older gentlemen, checked in on me while Roy Orbison and Frank Sinatra played in the background. First, I received the bread then a garden salad, followed with the meal ordered and finally with an unexpected plate of fresh fruit slices. I had a pleasant time as did the younger group at one table and the three generations of a family at another."}, {"review_id": "Jm-Z_5hJVkSnF2PG-QOcsg", "user_id": "V-dcL_ZCTD1TGkSQRRDEFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2017", "text": "Great food in a low key yet traditional atmosphere.
