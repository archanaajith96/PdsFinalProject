The decor in there by far one of my all time favorites, and I have seen some nice coffee shops across the country. It's never loud in there, so its a great place to go study for school, hang out with friends, or even just a quick 5 minute stop N go for coffee. The coffee: The coffee has been great every time I've been there. it's consistent, and it's never too hot or too cold. One thing i love here is the flavor of their coffee you can really taste the beans that they use.. when you can taste their beans even in a latte, then that's saying something.The Location: I love the location of this place, though i would prefer there to be more parking along the stripe, but its not that big of a deal. Overall, this place is a must stop by if your in Norman, Ok or even just passing through. You won't regret it, and if you do then I'll buy you a cup of coffee there, and we will discuss why you think this place is better than Starbucks."}, {"review_id": "IyJmA2hUffa27K25vCeq4Q", "user_id": "1XKxxvXWut9xtIywjbvctQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "Have you ever heard of those stories where random strangers see someone in need, so they spring into action? Like when an ER nurse stumbles upon some unresponsive person in the street, so they do chest compressions to save that person's life? Well I had a similar experience at Gray Owl Coffee. This visit began like just like every other coffee shop visit. I walked up to the counter and ordered a pour over coffee to go. The barista rang me out and started to make my coffee. While she was still making my coffee, another customer showed up. Thinking she could probably take this order in the time between pours, she started ringing them up. As soon as she does, another person walks in. And another. And another. Soon enough there was a five or six-person line building up, so she has to stay there and ring them all up. I think there was one customer that didn't know what they wanted because the line screeched to a halt. So there I am waiting for my coffee, which is almost done, but the barista at the register is too busy to help give the drink to me. Clear across the shop, another employee, we'll call him Heroic Bearded Barista (HBB), turns and sees me waiting. He looks at the pour over station to see the final drops land in the cup. His eyes dart between me and the coffee and he thinks to himself, \"that man needs his coffee!\" Weaving through customers and vaulting over tables, HBB skillfully makes his way towards the bar.* Upon reaching the bar, he grabbed the cup and heroically called out, \"Pour over to go!\" I received my drink, gave him my thanks, and took a sip of the coffee. It was a darn good cup of coffee. Expensive, but good. Thanks, HBB. Though you didn't make my coffee, you made sure that I got it.[*] Dramatization: May Not Have Happened."}, {"review_id": "BBq6qbR46tRzhL9zZo-rXg", "user_id": "rGDqGxhk_xnps0XfnZNBlQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "A good place for a small breakfast and morning drink. I'd already hit my coffee quota for the day by the time I made it here, so no input on that, but the chai was pretty good - very sweet with nice foamy milk. I had a quiche involving gouda that was downright inspired. In addition, I appreciated the seating options and spaciousness.

There's not a specialty coffee anywhere comparable to them until you get to OKC. They ALWAYS have their espresso dialed in - clear that they care. Their pour-overs are on point. I recommend grabbing a slice of quiche while you're there. The vibe is \"chill living room\" and the patrons are a mix of locals and students. Nothing haughty. My only \"complaint\" is that they did not have a variety of beans for different drinks. Just one roast on espresso and one on single cup."}, {"review_id": "4JJYhpXf5EpPPTHcu407mQ", "user_id": "Oh1ZSywwI2A4VTubRIh9Aw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "I really do not like the music played in Gray Owl.  It is stressful.  I want to encourage y'all to play music that is easier to listen to.

I spent a lot of time studying here as an undergrad & still continue to visit every now & then. The coffee is incredible! You seriously cannot go wrong with any beverage you choose. The loose-leaf tea selection is quite expansive & the latte options are to die for! My ultimate favorite drink to get here is a soy vanilla latte. Sounds boring right? WRONG! I don't know if it's the type of vanilla syrup they use, or the espresso shots they pull- but it really is heaven in your mouth. Get it hot in the winter & iced in the summer- you won't be disappointed! Aside from their 10/10 drinks, they also make all of their pastry-case items in house. I love this because it really gives it that nice touch of \"feeling at home\" & knowing you can trust the ingredients they use. There are also a good amount of gluten-free options to choose from as well. Pro-tip: they also do catering orders for any of their pastries if you're looking for something delicious & organic!The \"vibe\" here is really chill & pretty hipster. I love it though. The chairs/tables are all mismatched & there's local artists' artwork hanging on the walls. It can get a little busy here especially during finals week each semester, so finding a table can be hard. Never be afraid to ask to share a table if you see someone sitting alone- this is a common thing! P.S. Bring cash if you plan on buying anything under $3 (that's the minimum for using cards)Also, tip your barista! :)"}, {"review_id": "mOaRLwX4eOQoQ8NSm53vNA", "user_id": "MDgqv77imOsvzSomVPct3A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2018", "text": "Had a warm (just right!) rice milk latte today, it was perfect.

Sometimes, it's great. They've got good tea, drool-worthy pastries, and plenty of games to play with friends. Sometimes, it's not so great. They have live bands which draw obnoxious, loud crowds. That would be fine and dandy if the building could handle it, but the building is just NOT set up to hold a band and fans. It's not big enough, and the acoustics make it an unpleasant, will want to make you want to bash your head into the tables experience.Speaking of tables, good luck finding one when you're there. I've gone into Gray Owl several times, felt guilty for wanting to walk right back out, begrudgingly ordered a drink, then promptly left and gone elsewhere. There's not many plugs, and the tables and chairs that are there are rickety. Tons of people love this place, but it's just not a comfortable option for me when it comes to grabbing a cup of tea and working."}, {"review_id": "zTViTl4DaYrKIwVrhqjL3w", "user_id": "d3kCRcxYOYsW5uECxgHl3w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/26/2018", "text": "I really wanted to like this place because its near my house and seems like it has a cool atmosphere. Walked in and not one of the workers said hi, they all stared at us like we had just walked into their house without knocking. I ordered a blueberry muffin and despite the fact that there was not one seat available I was like okay I can still enjoy this. However, they straight up gave me a muffin with a hair baked across the top of it. Which like, maybe I could forgive that. But then when I say \"oh hey, there's a hair straight up baked into my muffin\" he takes the muffin back and stares at me. Like maybe I put this hair into the muffin myself somehow. He then just gives me a new muffin and doesn't even say sorry. Now I'm questioning how safe the new muffin is.

Cons: Had to bring my baby a couple times to study because we didn't have a sitter-- this place really doesn't scream \"infant friendly\" to me, but whatever.  Baby stayed quiet-- if he had been loud I really wouldn't have felt comfortable staying, but when I went to change him I discovered that they don't have any relatively sanitary changing space to use.  In the end, we used a blanket on the floor, in the cleanest corner of the cleanest of the bathrooms. I know \"mom-with-baby-in-tow\" isn't the vibe these guys are going for, but seriously, one of those fold-down things in just one of the bathrooms is $200 (google \"baby changing station ADA\") and the cost of installation.  It wouldn't be the silliest thing the business has ever spent time/money on, of that I'm sure, and parents who are also students would appreciate it."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gray-owl-coffee-norman?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
