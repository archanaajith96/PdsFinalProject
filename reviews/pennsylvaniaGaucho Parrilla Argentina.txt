Always worth the long wait in line. Some of the best chimichurri you'll ever have- do yourself a favor and get some extra toast just to dip in the sauces. I recommend the Asado Platter- good to split between 4 people when you order lots of sides! The empanadas are also great, but they do sometimes run out before the end of the night, so try to get there before then! 10/10 highly recommend. Great food at a reasonable price considering the quality & quantity. Be sure to bring your own wine or beer!"}, {"review_id": "NV8OECpwohXVMY6mUh9VCw", "user_id": "RxL3KOklOuN-j10w-nrWpw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Everyone said this was THE place to try. Come early, especially for lunch and dinner. Otherwise, be prepared to wait in line for 45-60 minutes. And yes, that line goes outside and around the side of the building, rain or shine or snow and bitter cold. They take debit/credit cards. Food: We had the lamb, a NY strip steak, and a ribeye. All the meats were prepared to the requested level of doneness. Lamb has a bit too much salt for my liking, but otherwise fresh and flavorful. Good char on all the meat. No one in our party of three cared for the charred bread accompanying the meats. Salads that came with each meat were lightly dressed in a vinaigrette. Empanadas were amazing! The pork empanada was our fave. Sides of cauliflower, broccolini, and green beans were simple and tasty. Service: You line up and order from the main counter. There is NO TABLE service. Drinks first, then food. Staff are proficient in explaining what's on the menu, which is a massive chalkboard on a wall as you enter. Based on your time in line, you should have plenty of time to review what's on the menu. Specials are posted lower on smaller individual chalkboards near the front of the line. Cost: A small lamb, 6oz. ribeye, and 6oz. NY strip steak with side salads, 6 pc. shrimp appetizer, sides of cauliflower, green beans, and broccolini, with a pork empanada and a chicken empanada ran us about $85 after tax. Not cheap and portions are so-so. Overall: I wouldn't line up for it again, but it's worth a try. They do have a sign for the last group to be seated to hold noting they are the end of the line. This is so more folks don't wait in line in case they run out of food."}, {"review_id": "XNvQqlEIUr_Bd75GkzfkiQ", "user_id": "YEBj1ua6MrlFFU_MKaggqQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Not impressed at all.

I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I especially appreciate the ease of ordering, being seating and the numerous options of entrees and chimichurri. I arrived with a party of 8 and was delighted that we had a table ready for us. What eas even better was our food was coming to us hot and steamy no more than 5 minuted later. I found it impressive to prepare appetizers and entrees for 8 in such an efficient time.I ordered the small plate of shrimp, 6 total, the roasted potatoes and a veggie empanada. All were amazing.

(Or order takeout!)Gaucho is fantastic. On our first visit we waited in line for more than 2 hours. And it was worth it.I had the Cerdo (roasted pork with roasted onions, greens and grilled bread). This was quite possibly the greatest pork I have ever had. Juicy, flavorful and paired perfectly with sides.  My wife had the small strip steak - again perfectly cooked.  We shared roasted vegetables and empanadas - both delicious.But to me, the real star is the dipping sauces. My wife is obsessed with the chimichurri, while I love the garlic and roasted onion. Tip 1: Gaucho doesn't serve alcohol, but they don't have corkage fees and encourage you to bring your own. Bring wine (which many people did) or walk down the street to one of the many fine purveyors of alcohol in the Strip District (we went to East End Brewing Company). Tip 2: If you don't want to wait, just order for carry out. Call early and walk right to the front of the line and take your order home."}, {"review_id": "JLKRHvYNYof5sfhMXNilmw", "user_id": "X7mVSZxStPxD4GbN_29pYQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We finally corralled a group to check out their huge Paella pan and headed over to wait in line for an hour on a Saturday night.  They don't take reservations and seat your group when you place your order.  So plan on an hour wait around 6PM on a Saturday.  We opened our BYOB wine and drank it while we were waiting and shared it with some nice folks behind us.  We started our meal with three veggie and three chicken empanadas with some of their unbelievable chimmi sauces.  The garlic sauce was so good, I put a big old dab of it on the Argentina Salad too.  Four of us split a large salad and it was plenty.  It had some super fresh avocado slices, a red potato, roasted red peppers, carrots, and a mixed lettuce.  The dressing was killer good vinaigrette.  We stuffed ourselves with all of this deliciousness and then, the PAELLA PAN arrived and took over our table.  This thing is HUGE.There was grilled lemon in the center ring surrounded by pieces of grilled chorizo and the entire ring was rimmed with fresh shrimp.  The ratio of rice to protein was off but the leftover lemony saffron goodness came in handy before bedtime when round two of paella gorge-fest occurred.Our service was outstanding, as always, and the meal was really satisfying for everyone.  Super fresh, cooked to perfection and hot when it arrived.  We really liked the brick walls and beautiful wooden plank floor.  It's a great place for a group or a date.  You really can't go wrong."}, {"review_id": "RguGMegF119E4W3WvmErYg", "user_id": "zdpn-MrLT_QPhwJ5-KHKCA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Although this is a fun and casual place for dinner with friends, I think the seasoning on the food here is overwhelming. The steaks are also pretty expensive for the amount you get (about 4-5 slices for small, which typically runs me $15). Their sauces are colorful and interesting, but way too oily. I also don't understand why they would serve the steaks with chimichurri sauce if they think we would also like to try their other sauces. The rub for the meat is also too salty anyway. I wish I could appreciate all the flavors in their sauces, but I think to save on costs they dilute the sauces down with oil. I have tried to reproduce some of their sauces at home and I can guarantee they are more interesting with less oil. Food also takes awhile to be served, but they are BYOB so drink it up while you wait it out. Overall, I keep coming back mostly for the cool vibes and decor, but the steaks could be so much more."}, {"review_id": "RXhHbgQpARMcoOa4RPmm7A", "user_id": "JVoI8PjfVDGnyfMBRQc8eg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2018", "text": "On my trip to Pittsburg I heard through the grapevine that this place was somewhere I had to go. Well this place was fantastic and it is a must go to place if you are in Pittsburg and you love meat. Everything tasted extremely good. The steak came out to perfection and the sides were very good as well. They also server about 4-5 different meat sauces. These are probably the best part and take the meat to a whole different level! This place is kinda expensive so be prepared to spend a little. But it is totally worth it for-sure. The building is small, but the food is good so I could understand why there was a long line when I arrived. They have a very nice setup that relied on mostly natural lighting. I like that they had l4 containers of spice next to the line so you could taste them. We had to wait about 30 minutes to get to the desk then about another 20-30 for the food. But it was worth the wait.

I always recommend this whenever friends or coworkers ask about casual but quality food places to check out. The steaks here are REALLY GOOD! Make sure you get all the sauces they have (and take some home too :')) - full of lots of flavor. Gaucho gets packed superrrrr quickly - so either come here with a very small group (or by yourself, lol) or come at weird times, unless you're okay with waiting in line for almost an hour. I've seen lines wrap around this place in the dead of winter so.. you know its good. There's a decent amount of seating in the back (it's an order and sit-down place - but they will bring our your food for you and help clean up), but be sure to have a back-up plan in case it's crazy in there.

Don't get me wrong, the food was great, but not amazing. I came here with my brother at what I thought would've been at an off-time. It was neither lunch nor dinner, right around 3:30pm; yet, there was still a long line outside the small entry way. Mind you, Pittsburgh had just received about a foot of snow the night before so most of the streets were empty; however, Gaucho Parilla must be doing something right for it to still have its patrons wanting it when it's freezing outside. It being our first time here, and seeing how busy it was. We could only imagine it to be worth the wait. The prices were a little on the steeper end, but I wanted to try a little bit of everything so we shared the Parrillada Mixta (NY Strip steak, grilled chicken boob and spicy chorizo with 2 pieces of toast), an order of the beef empanadas, and a small El Gaucho salad. The steak was prepared at a perfect medium rare and was delicious. The chicken boob [sic] was juicy and paired perfectly with the Pimenton-Red Pepper sauce. The spicy chorizo was also very tasty. The portion sizes weren't too large and honestly was the perfect amount of food. The beef empanadas are highly recommended. The outer crust is very crispy with the innards seasoned well and yummy. I could've had just these empanadas and been perfectly satisfied, although it would've probably taken 10 of them. I would recommend Gaucho Parilla to anyone visiting or even residing in Pittsburgh if it didn't take forever to get into the restaurant and order. I would not recommend if you're coming with a super large party, although they can very well accommodate for one."}, {"review_id": "5L4fkeV7RH77cD2uMVNjBw", "user_id": "6BnvEluqfazShd1tg9kqGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Food= amazing, waiting in line to get into this place = not so amazing.

For starters, if you're going to GPA, you need to get there as early as you can because the lines get really long, really quickly!  My group of four arrived at around 5pm on a Saturday night and the line was already out the door.  Once you're in the line, you can check out their chalkboard menu.  Be aware that they will erase items as soon as they're sold out of them so have a backup in mind just in case they run out before you can order.  After you place your order, the restaurant staff will hook you up with a table in their dining area.The decor is really cool with an old western feel.  They have plenty of non-alcoholic drinks for your convenience but this is actually a BYOB establishment.  They will provide you with stemware and you can bring in whatever you want!  This is a great way to ensure you'll be able to drink what you want and it comes at a lesser cost!  They don't even charge a corkage fee.  Now for the best part: the food.  My meal at GPA ranks in the top ten meals I have ever consumed, in my life.  I am not exaggerating.  I ordered the sirloin with a side of grits.  My steak was cooked to perfection and had the most delicious seasoning.  It came with a side salad that was fresh and tasty.  I also enjoyed a piece of chargrilled toast and it was amazing!  Finally, the grits were the best I've ever had in my life and that is no tall tale.  This place gets ALL of the stars.  We all loved it and next time I go to Pittsburgh, I will likely eat all of my meals there because that city definitely has nothing that could top Gaucho Parillo Argentina.  Keep up the work, GPA!  See you next time I'm in town.  (Unless, of course, you decide to take up my offer to come to Ohio!!!)"}, {"review_id": "ZOVC_g68irL1lj0a91j8Og", "user_id": "ithS6Xc_So_WiEflAA_QNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Just got to town for a convention and absolutely starving so decided to look for yelp restaurant recommendations in close proximity to my hotel in downtown Pittsburgh. There was a jimmy johns and seven eleven across the street but after a harrowing 4 hour drive from DC I needed to reward myself with something amazing. This restaurant was a little over half a mile from my hotel but I didn't care. Made the 6 block trek in record time and let's just say my stomach thanked me. I had the ribeye steak plate with a salad and the salad was a beautiful concoction of mixed greens with shaved carrots, baby tomatoes and radishes wonderfully dressed with a balsamic dressing and sprinkled with fresh black pepper. This place carries four house sauces. A chimnichurriesque one, a garlic, a Smokey one and one made of onions. All great accompaniments to the steak and salad. I actually drank some of the sauce from the little plastic cup because it was so good. I ordered the broccolini as an additional side and it came with a beautiful char off the grill. I drenched it in the garlic sauce and that just elevated the flavor although it was already divine. My favorite sauce was the garlic sauce but who doesn't love garlic but the others might appeal to others. While the food was pretty awesome the wait staff were also very attentive. While you're ordering someone gets your table prepped and walks you to it. This same individual also brings you a sampler of the four sauces which I think is a nice touch. This place only serves coke products but is byob with and no uncorking fee for those who need some wine with their steak.

I would recommend it to anyone visiting the area for the first time.I love getting the steak sandwiches, but honestly anything is good here. As a side I would recommend the potatoes. One of the best parts of the Gaucho experience is the self-serve sauces they have. When I go with friends we usually have a good time talking about which is our favorite (I maintain that the ajo/garlic one is the best!). Sometimes when I'm extra hungry I even get some toast to eat with the sauce, but a sandwich or any other entree is usually more than enough. Prepare by going with an empty stomach!Just one note of caution: lines can get very long. I have waited in a line for around 2 hours to get in on a Friday or Saturday night. If you want to get in quick I would recommend going for lunch on a weekday, but there still might be a bit of a line. It does go pretty quick though!
