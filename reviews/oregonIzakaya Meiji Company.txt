I have been to this establishment probably 10 times and I have yet to be disappointed. To start, the restaurant is dimly lit, with candles on each table and on both bars. It gets pretty busy so sometimes you cozy up at the bar or at a larger table with other patrons. Drinks are made properly and are always delicious. They have great specials.My go to for appetizers are Wakame Salad, Kimchi & the Pickle Plate. I LOVE the Spicy Tuna cocktail. The burger is always bomb. I tried frog legs here for the first time ever and they were actually amazing. Late night ramen is a must."}, {"review_id": "6loYKiIn3HgW0qHfhJUBpw", "user_id": "nEnvPEBoZE5pR5700Afw7A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I really don't know why it's always so busy.. food is ok a bit salty and plain. They need to change menu maybe play w seasons I don't know too boring for my taste and the servers have an attitude most of them most of the time.It's an over rated place for my opinion."}, {"review_id": "qJmIqt2O5fRM-Ti7xPx7bQ", "user_id": "OmM6uZdjsA3Xh-crcsdbdA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Came here for a late dinner on a Sunday night w a friend. Super cute dim lighting atmosphere for a date night. It was busy and packed so we sat at the bar. The food was mediocre- small plates to share. Wouldn't consider this to even be a jap restaurant. They had late night menu w \"ramen\" that was more bland than I have ever tasted. We had to add soy sauce, kimchi, and chili oil to make it even decent. The staff were great. Sat next to a waitress that actually worked there While she was eating her dinner and gave us recommendations. The sake was delicious! I would come back just for the atmosphere and drinks."}, {"review_id": "QGC1bSJJGesv2YQ1rRK9dA", "user_id": "XyWS_swdy-_kuApR3BSfsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "This is a very unique place. Its like Asian tapas. They have some more substantial dishes but from what we experienced its mostly small plates and you won't leave hungry.  The bar is exceptional and the drinks are very well made.  We had mostly seafood plates. The garlic shrimp and the scallop may be one of the best things I have ever eaten. Just really fresh and well balanced.  The mushrooms under the scallop...oh man I just wish I had a bowl of them.  We also had a plate with fresh anchovy (not raw just not brined) on a piece of bread that had butter on it that had been seasoned with sea urchin.  It was very rich and so delicious.  We had the fried chicken nuggets and fries too which would be perfect for kids!  Not a truly family place but if you sat outside and have them this to eat it would keep them quiet for awhile!  Great vibe for a Sunday night!"}, {"review_id": "Z9dUPpuPuBAf1dag-fU-Bg", "user_id": "VX27Q52tlm8G_rmMQ8-AWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Great food!

Friends of ours recommended Meiji so we decided to try it out. I'll get to the point now - our meal was incredible. Every plate was so flavorful. The Goma Ae was so good we ordered it twice. Red Snapper was cooked to perfection and melted like butter in my mouth. The Shiitake mushroom skewers should not be missed either. Can't wait to eat here again."}, {"review_id": "tOMVlNXy6fvwJlEfwH40JQ", "user_id": "3ZQjY1NwSKhZx-MsIjFsgw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This place is an Absolute Joke!!...They staff and management told my Lady and her friend , mind you after ordering their second craft cocktail from the bar , and I quote \" Since your not ordering food  , Standing is Good for You\"..also all but seat at the bar were empty?!!! I'm a food and beverage manager by trade, and last time I checked establishments make more money off of cocktails and return costumers than they do food??! ...How do you justify telling two young women who are spending money at your restaurant that they cant sit if NOT ordering food at an empty bar..??? In a town like Eugene where folks are supposed to be accepting, understanding and welcoming this kind of ridiculous/eliteist behavior would make Donald Trump Proud!!!

The bartender was really cool and kept giving me samples of his favorite Japanese whiskey. I almost want to detour from driving back to California via the 1 in order to stop back in Eugene. This is the single best reason to come to this city. Had a ginger and bourbon for $7. Why doesn't every cocktail bar have this. Had a shot of Meiji whisky that I tried at the whiskey bar in Milpitas at almost half the price. Had some other things that I don't remember. The other normal patrons had food that looked delicious but I was too drunk to try.

The downside- it's crowded, parking is typically a little difficult in Whiteaker area, and usually pretty noisy so I would not recommend bringing a large group. We sat at the bar and ordered a couple of cocktails and plates to try. I usually stick with wine or beer, but the cocktails were truly fantastic! Our food was delicious as well. They are tapa style plates, which are great for sharing. However if you eat a lot (like my husband) plan on spending a decent amount of money to be full. I love the concept of getting lots of small plates to share and trying lots of unique dishes. Overall, definitely recommend and we will be back!!"}, {"review_id": "SoA_zsm7dbpDKmi2EC5qFw", "user_id": "LWaKqRLyi8bxjWA7dU90Ag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "One of my favorite places to eat in Eugene.

All of the Yelp reviews talking about the rude wait staff, especially managers, is spot on. Sitting at the bar is the most pleasant experience, as they are always friendly, and it is the best way to order an awesome Onigri and to be able to leave quickly without hassle. Meijis also has exceptional desserts, especially the banana sundae, which is unexpected for a whiskey bar, but it is worth taking a second glance at the dessert menu, especially from one of the 2 restaurant bars, if you're there with small groups.  Large groups should go elsewhere or arrive at opening, which depending on the manager may still be hard."}, {"review_id": "tWgXO8T57RtMs_S6EYv6ag", "user_id": "2R1ybW9ks4L6rIpaWudTLA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Service was surly, rushed, and resentful.
