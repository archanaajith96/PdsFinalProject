Another trip to Memphis had me back for a late lunch before heading to the airport. I tried the smoke sausage this time. As I placed my order a customer also waiting confirmed that I was making a good decision. It was served on a bun topped with the mustardy coleslaw that I love. The link is dipped in a fryer before serving to give it a crispy snap.  So good. This was also a classic \"over-order\" situation for me. I still had to have the Chopped Plate too.  Add a can of Coke and a big tip, still less than $20 bucks. I have never been let down!!!  Give them a try!!!"}, {"review_id": "F1hiBhYpJl8mo_3TjLMdqw", "user_id": "SaADYW0YJKXbL80xDSe20g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "Where to start? Everything about Payne's is as good as it gets :-) from the down home, nothing-fancy-about-this-place decor both inside and out to the honest and amazing BBQ and sides, you cannot go wrong with Payne's. A friend and I went for lunch one afternoon while in town and each loved our choices: she had the pork ribs, beans and slaw, and I had rib ends, beans and slaw. Both meat plates weer succulent and flavorful- nothing dry or overcooked at all. The beans were chockful of meaty pork bits, and the slaw had that Memphis mustardy-vinegary bite that so perfectly complements the sweet and smoky flavors in the meat. Repeat: Cannot. Go. Wrong. They close early and are not open Sundays so get there early and enjoy every last bite!"}, {"review_id": "1xY7bnuS1you7Ea9zeO6Ww", "user_id": "2yur9dbYINdaxroDYvVCJA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Disappointing is how I would describe my Payne's experience.  Based on previous Yelp reviews and the general look and setup of this hole in the wall place, it had the appearance of potentially being one of those places that hits it out of the park with their bbq. Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  I sampled their bbq sandwich and smoked sausage.  Both came with a healthy dose of their mustard slaw, which seems to be their signature unique style that differentiates them from the rest.  While I have previously had (and enjoyed) slaw on bbq, the mustard slaw just didn't work for me.  It became the dominating flavor of the meal and good smoked meat should stand by itself and not be overwhelmed by another flavor.  Furthermore, the bbq sandwich was sort of a \"sloppy-joe\" style which I didn't care for and further hid any of the meat's smokey flavor. Finally, I found it surprising they did not serve iced tea here, sweet or otherwise.  Canned Coke products only."}, {"review_id": "ykPN7E0llP8GF2pHUF2xuw", "user_id": "rfDqKDpd1_B-VlkPDfHsqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/12/2017", "text": "We were referred here from people in Indiana and wow they were right. I had the plate.  So generous and only $7.50 . The mustard slaw is delicious on the pork. Such a great combination.  The pork is hands down the best I have ever had in my life. The sauce is vinegar based I think and just perfect. You just can't stop eating it. The beans they even top w pork!  Seriously  bravo.

The slaw is a mustardy vinegar base--matter of fact it looks and tastes like pickled relish.  The baked beans were inedible, reminding me more of pinto beans than anything. The pork tarred and feathered my soul--all Memphis restaurants should know how to master this protein so how did Payne's not get the memo?  The pig was full of fat and also diced resulting in a loss for me. The sausage was low-key bomb! Charred to the perfect crisp and full of flavor.  I doubt they make it in-house because if they did, I'm sure the sausage would've come out disrespectful like their cousin Pork.Ok, so maybe I'm being a little harsh. The staff was very friendly and I liked the fact that the menu had about 13 items--short and sweet.  I just cannot believe that this establishment is a Memphis delicacy.  Take your Memphis-barbecue-eating-behind to the Bar-B-Q Shop instead!"}, {"review_id": "k2h7bGka7hi5AqWV5NixYQ", "user_id": "cMUJpoOyQTz9lzxdccOEWQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "I stopped by when I got to Memphis (my hometown), for a quick bite.

I had been before some years ago and was eager to come back. Wasn't disappointed. Payne's, despite the unassuming location and bare bones interior, serves up the best bbq pork sandwich you'll ever eat. between the buns is a heaping serving of smoked chopped (not pulled) pork with pieces of the crunchy bark mixed in , topped with that signature, fabulous Memphis-style mustard based cole slaw and their delectable house based slaw.The ingredients all compliment one another wonderfully in a delicious confluence that leaves you wanting to order another. This sandwich is a *masterpiece*, and Payne's is a gem that will hopefully be around a long time to come. If you haven't been, you need to go.

Also got a bologna and it was good but we didn't finish it all but could have eaten a bucket of pork! Yum.

First off a jumbo chopped bbq plate with two sides and a bun...and coke... $10.Ten dollars.There was enough bbq left after i made my own sandwich. Medium sauce. A little spicy at first but sweet at the end. Mustard slaw. I didnt know about that, didnt look right. But damn. That s*** is good. Baked beans with a healthy dose of bbq in it. F yeah.Fyi they do take cards. Now... that bathroom. I give that place an f. Pee before you go!Building looks to be an old gas station.

I've wanted to go for some time - ever since I saw that Payne's had made it to the Sweet 16 of a national BBQ \"tournament.\"I love the store. It's a throwback to the 40s or 50s maybe based on the floor tile. Food is served from a kitchen directly across from the order window and sauce is ladled onto the meat from a sauce pan kept warm by a gas stove. CASH ONLY!The meat was good and the sauce was good as well. The slaw was a vinegar-based version and the beans had some meat in them as well. All food is served in the same square, partitioned styrofoam containers with plastic ware and Cam drinks.

You're going to carry the beautiful smell of their smoke with you for several hours - dress accordingly.3. Don't expect any frills - you're there for the smoked meat.This is a hole-in-the-wall family owned and staffed place in a sketchy neighborhood.  That said, it is a place you NEED to go if you're from out of town and on the prowl for some fine smoked meat.Their menu is simple.  How simple?  About 4 items simple...chopped pork, ribs, bologna and sausage.  There are some sides but unless my memory is failing me that's it.  No brisket, no burnt ends, no poultry of any kind.  And that's alright moma, yeah, that's alright by me!I had a miniscule bite of the ribs and found them to be flavorful, smoky and moist.  They belonged to Kid 2 and she's pretty protective of her ribs so I can't render more of an opinion than that.I had their chopped pork sandwich, regular size, with hot bbq sauce.  The sandwich comes on a large bun that in no way manages to contain the pile of meat heaped upon it.  There is a smaller pile of their mustard slaw served atop the meat as well.  Yep, get a fork.The meat was chopped pretty uniformly which made it easier to eat.  I really liked the amount of bark that was mixed in and the extra sweetness and slight crunch in each of those bites.  The meat itself was something to behold.  Tender, juicy and moist enough to make it a pleasure to eat.  The great smoky flavor permeated into the meat beyond the bark.  I'm not usually one who likes my slaw on my sandwich but in this case it really worked.  The vinegary zip of the yellow mustard really did bring out even more flavor from the meat, something I didn't think possible.Yep, this is a place you NEED to try when you're in Memphis."}, {"review_id": "69X12Vw6rqTxBOiiiAPfOg", "user_id": "S6Kn9uF4GzBd--fUCUDg0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/23/2017", "text": "First time to Memphis and this is the first place I stopped for BBQ due to the reviews.
