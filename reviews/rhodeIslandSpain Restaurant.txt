It's on the expensive side and I usually go there for special occasions; mainly for my birthdays. The food and service was always wonderful. The menu is large with lots of Spanish inspired entrees.I usually get the shrimp and saffron paella for $17.50. I love paella so that's always my first pick. The paella was delicious and had the perfect amounts of shrimp and rice; also it's not too salty! I also paired it with a red sangria. Everybody in my party enjoyed their meals and service. The service was fast and friendly; our drinks were filled and the food came out quick. I really enjoy going to this establishment and highly recommend it, if not for a special occasion, just a regular night out for a delicious dinner. Also, parking lot is big; I suggest calling to make reservations."}, {"review_id": "LeNnaytMP53KkxgpINsV9w", "user_id": "8MdLRHSKok2RzD2PkeXCOQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Lovely place. .ambience is spot on.. Seafood lovers should definitely try this restaurant. . Varieties of meat in the platter of Mariscada Verde!! Pollo Napoleon with layers of chicken n eggplant was scrumptious.  Enjoyed the appetizer which got our hopes high on entrees. Chicken enchinadilla had just the perfect flavor I would have wanted to enjoy my dinner. Overall an amazing experience. Not highly recommended for non seafood lovers as my friend did not seem to enjoy it as much due to the narrowed down options."}, {"review_id": "_Z0j0I13EUk3IFA7bO6vNA", "user_id": "A7_RUaX9r9CfNbPdhI_6Jg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/15/2017", "text": "Exceptional. Spain has been around for 30 years and after every experience here, I am reminded exactly why. This place exceeds what has become the normal dining experience in Rhode Island in every way. The sangria, the service, the ambiance, and the food- all 5 stars!I went on Mother's Day which is understandably a huge day for any restaurant. Considering we had reservations and they were full to capacity with reservations from 11:30am until close, they were beyond prepared and we never felt rushed, not even for even a second. It was such a wonderful afternoon. If you are coming here, I mean you need to start with a pitcher of the sangria. It is excellent and has tasted the same for as long as I can remember. Bread is fresh and the house garlic butter is amazing. We started with the calamari which has long been my favorite calamari in RI (still is after yesterday)! For my meal I always order the Pollo Jerez. This is consistently flavorful and offers up a unique taste. It's tender chicken breast layered up with asparagus and fresh spinach loaded with cheese and a Brandy sauce baked over homemade mashed potatoes. DELICIOUS! Highly recommend this dish here. Desserts here are always changing up. For the table, we split the classic flan, an order of the banana foster empanadas and the chocolate chip bread pudding which was OUT OF THIS WORLD!I find it hard to imagine having a less than stellar meal here. A must try place!"}, {"review_id": "fFQfkHpPNNbpEN4knIzjLg", "user_id": "xJvZAMZS4j7_WJr4rwq_Xw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "It was a beautiful tasty all around experience. They had a welcoming helpful staff. And dinner was a true experience. The food....oh my god!! It was so tasty. I think my husband and I both over ate because it was just too good. The cocktails were also amazing! I must say, it was pricey for what we usually do for diner, but worth every penny for sure. I started with a soup, had a pasta (with chicken, shrimp and scallops), finished with a hot tea and bread pudding. My husband has the lemon chicken followed by a cappuccino and lava cake dessert (I can't recall the name). So good. I had a cantaloupe martini and my husband had a margarita (2 because they were so good).

Ambience and decor is spot on but the food is subpar. Incredibly overpriced. There are so many better restaurants (Chez Pascal & the Wurst Kitchen blows them away). There was barely any Authentic Spanish items on the menu (mostly Italian). Neither my fiancé nor I took any of the leftovers home: that's how underwhelmed we were.

Aside from that I highly recommend Spain Restaurant. The service is always excellent, the atmosphere is a little cool feeling, but well designed including the wood accents, stucco, fountain, etc. They only open the upstairs seating on certain days, which I found to be a little more cozy and intimate than the downstairs area, but both are nice.They have some really exotic cocktails and I have to say the pina colada I had there was probably the best, and the strongest!The food was excellent, well prepared. I had the Chicken Marsala, soup and there was rice served with my entree. When I came here last it was for a family birthday. They will serenade you with a birthday song sung in Spanish, complete with maracas, and guitar. They had quite an extensive dessert selection too.I highly recommend Spain, everything was very good.

The Bad - all four baskets of bread were burnt, even after we complained. Could not believe $11 per glass for Sangria!! And half the glass is ice and OK for taste.

It was my 21st birthday and we had just started dating. Thinking back to that time (12 years ago), I can't help but to think of how impressed I was with the service and the food. I remember I had the pork chop. Impressive memory. Anyway. Spain was for a while a place we went to for special occasions and it made us feel so grown up! As we started to explore the cuisine world, we forgot about Spain and hadn't been back until 2 years ago and more recently today. Today, we went with a group of 20. Spain, as always, was very accommodating and opened the restaurant for us at 3pm. 7 pitchers of Sangria later and possibly half of the menu, everyone left fully satisfied.The food and service withheld the standards we had set oh so many years ago."}, {"review_id": "wYMrwmOlifiaZpdBz5G4eQ", "user_id": "F6MPrQ5oxQL2Wq1v5ENDzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/16/2016", "text": "Excellent.   The service, the wine, the food.  Went there with some neighbors and we all got delicious meals.  Everyone raved about their food and the service.I got the Sole Frances and it was delicious.   It usually comes with mashed potatoes, but I asked for the potato chips instead.   What a great dish.   The vegetables, the chips and the fish were very good.    Some other people at the table enjoyed the paella, the Pollo al Limon, and the Mariscada Spain.    I got a glass of the house Cab and it was a great quality house wine.   I believe it was Chateau St Jean California Cab.Everything was reasonably priced and very well cooked.   The waiters were attentive and pleasant.   A great dining experience."}, {"review_id": "sqmBLnsJ8z1Gy6nT8IhwaA", "user_id": "eeKbUIDwPYxMsVPQbUFTFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/2/2016", "text": "There are very few restaurants that serve delicious food at reasonable prices and with amazing service. Spain absolutely nails these three points. I don't think I have ever had a restaurant completely knock my socks off like Spain did. In my younger (read: poorer) days, the $$$ rating was enough to keep me away from from here. However, the prices really are very reasonable. Unless you are going for an obnoxiously large steak, most entrees fall between 18-27 dollars. And the meal sizes are generous! This isn't one of those places that charges $20+ and then puts FDA-approved servings on your plate. You will leave here full, and likely with a to-go container. Menu is varied with chicken, seafood, and other items. Everything looks very good and I'm eager to return and try some other items. On this occasion I went with the Basque Style Fillet of Sole ($21.95, pictured), which I ordered based on other Yelp-review pictures. I was not disappointed. It came with clams, mussels, and shrimp as well as these homemade potato chips that well very tasty. That brings me to the service. The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. I don't think the water glasses got below the halfway mark before they were refilled. Having never been here before I was awe-struck when the food came out. Only moments after one waiter placed the food on the table, another came by to serve it out of the pan and onto my plate! All in all, this restaurant is amazing and I am looking forward to returning!"}, {"review_id": "HdRBFsoP8lHm_35Wms7PYQ", "user_id": "hNThPgPh8O_uo0nEa-i6jQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "The food was excellent; the service was awkward.
