I had some work to finish up that evening, so I needed a good meal to get my energy level back up. I checked my Yelp app, and I found this place to have good ratings. I made my way over here, and parked inside their own private lot. I walked in to find it not-too-busy. This was great, as I was starving.I looked through their menu, which was conveniently displayed on the board right by the cashier. I decided to go with a breakfast dish, and ordered their breakfast burrito. The burrito came with soup, and I had a glass of water to wash it all down.The soup was very good. I did not know what they put in it, but it had a nice spicy kick to it! After finishing the soup, my burrito came out shortly thereafter.The burrito was amazing! It came with three eggs, potato, cheese, and green pepper. It was huge, but I downed the whole thing as it was so good! The chef, who is also the owner, came out to greet me. He was a very friendly and upbeat guy. We talked a bit, and he gave me some good recommendations on where to go around town. His staff was also very friendly and talkative. This place beat any other restaurant I've been to as far as customer service and food.I hope they one day open up shop close to where I'm living. But until then, I'll have to wait for the next time I find myself in Las Cruces. If you find yourself in this city, do yourself a favor and come eat here."}, {"review_id": "1ZCxQEv_EtLwAjXA5_QgdQ", "user_id": "IR-1EYq4Ga7zUD2mVSLkFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Needle in a haystack! After reading numerous reviews on Yelp, Trip Advisor and Google: We chose to dine here. FYI, leave your \"feelings\" at the door so you don't get butt-hurt! The owner happened to take our orders and serve us. He was a very nice gentleman. My husband ordered the chicken Mole plate and I ordered a chile relleno with a side of mashed beans. I had a lemonade and my husband had a horchata: both the drinks were freshly made nothing out of a fountain. We were both pleased with our orders and decided to ordered Two potato tacos that came with a side house salad and a homemade avocado salad dressing. Everything had good flavor and was on point we will definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "kYedVUJ9XkzAv9x1Q3ezOg", "user_id": "1PP6iwUeeubfc-M19AeQvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "We had a fantastic lunch here.  The food was so fresh, flavorful without being too heavy.  Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "UVgOjGxCnLgBx9xnL79Lgg", "user_id": "2FPlQ_Oy3yCNNewh6edAtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "The rating is not high enough!Checked for 10 best Mexican restaurants,several of the choices would be closed by the time we reached the city,based on the time frame,Habanero's Fresh Mex was the  first choice Traveling from  from Roswell back to Tucson.The beef tostada presentation was off the chart,the veggies looked like they had just been picked!After mixing everything together,my first bite was totally unbelievable!I could taste the beans,meat sour cream,lettuce,tomatoe in each bite and the beans and meat were seasoned to perfection!The shell was crispy and light. i highly recommend this restaurant if you want fresh,authentic,delicious Mexican food!"}, {"review_id": "7uHAfHqhxAGp_B9t9RUYMA", "user_id": "1cYph6P1_FkEvJMtDiGGAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Love the fish tacos here.

I ordered the fish fajitas. I've never heard of such a thing. At $12, they did not fail to impress. It came with a separate plate of guac, sour cream, diced tomatoes, beans, rice and salsa. Tortillas of your choice. The platter was just what you'd expect a fajita platter to be: sizzling fish on a skillet with peppers and onions. It wasn't fried fish, it was grilled with seasoning. I like my fish on the salty side so I added some to my liking, but it was perfect. I made three good sized flour tacos, so adjust your appetite accordingly. You must try!I had two issues previously that appear to be somewhat resolved. The bathroom is immaculately clean, but stuffy. I had an issue with being offered chips and salsa, then it popping up as a surprise on my bill. This time, chips and salsa were free with my order, plus I received a bowl of the famous welcome soup. Its a little more expensive than most Mexican restaurants, but well worth it.I almost forgot. Those chips and salsa are some of the best you'll get anywhere. Crispy homemade chips and this beautiful deep red salsa that had heat, earthiness and a hint of sweet."}, {"review_id": "fdf5lKwNsC68nwEPQjmzaA", "user_id": "RVFGE8s4-paK0X5ZYuy3Sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Had the Fajitas Supreme as recommended by Felix himself, and it definitely reigned supreme in my book.

It's been a rough week at work and I've not had any authentic Mexican food so where I do I turn to?  My trusty Yelp! app!  Habaneros was close to the hotel so I figured I'd give it a go especially with the reviews...so glad I did!  If you don't want to read further, just know I left stuffed and the food was delicious!!! I hadn't eaten all day so I thought I'd start off with a carne asada fries. Big mistake!  There's no starting with these.  This is a meal!  Delicious French fries covered in a red chili sauce, topped with carne asada and cheese!  These were crazy good and it was all I could do to keep from destroying the plate. My meal was mahi tacos. Came out with refried beans and cheese, some rice, and tacos. Again, soooo delicious. With just two tacos, I could barely finish the second. Needless today, I went home with a box of the fries!  The place is small and intimate. Super traditional feeling inside. You order up front and it's to your table within 10 minutes or so. The staff was punctual and always eager to quench my thirst with another beer!  Oh Habaneros!  How lucky I am to have found you!"}, {"review_id": "fVGA491zjmTM4bMMS6UoFA", "user_id": "n4asiwvtOSBhMOZgS1ZjFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/11/2017", "text": "If I lived in Las Cruces this would be my go to restaurant.

The open sign was on, but i couldn't see anyone inside. And the windows all had bars on them.. I'm not familiar with this area and maybe that is standard but the word that I kept screaming in my head was \"SKETCH\"!! Felt sketchy, so sketchy! (I come from the suburbs of San Diego if that explains anything).. So as I was re-yelping the area and contemplating going somewhere else, another car pulled up and some people went in. It was only then that I mustered up the courage to walk in as well. And thank goodness I did! The potato tacos, vegan style (no cheese, with beans and vegan rice - which they charge a little extra for) were delicious! As were the free chips and salsa. It all tasted fresh and healthy with lots of flavor. I unintentionally made it really difficult for the poor girl taking my order who was most likely new and kind of clueless, but nice. She forgot to give me my green salsa, but I felt bad bothering her again.

Take a look at the photos. When you go there, don't be just hungry, or really hungry, or REALLY HUNGRY--better be RAVENOUS!!!! I'm telling you, the photos don't do that beast of a meal justice. IT'S HUGE!!! Most burritos or chimis aren't a match for me--I gobble 'em up, no sweat. But the Macho Chimi, well, that's another story. I wouldn't be lying if I said it got a whimper or two out of me. And the flavor was as big as the chimi itself! Both the beef and chicken were moist and tasty; same with the beans and rice. And the salsa verde on top couldn't have been better. I almost forgot--the tortilla was fried properly, not so crispy that it cracks when it's cut with crumbs flying everywhere. Rather, the crust was tender, yet toothsome. Some sour cream and guacamole were on the plate to round things off. All in all, one of the best I've had, and that's saying a lot.So, should you find yourself in Las Cruces and RAVENOUS (and don't tell me you never get that way!) stop in at Habanero's Fresh Mex and grab a Macho Chimi--you'll be begging for mercy when you're done!"}, {"review_id": "wRpElRrmI7FxuodrNXY4dg", "user_id": "0nKKb6toZosqn67ct_H4nw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "Ordered take out while visiting Las Cruces and came here based on high recommendations.
