The atmosphere, the food, the drinks- it's all amazing. Last week I went with a friend and we started with the chicken wings. I got a rice bowl with chicken and kimchi which was amazing. My friend got the Key Largo and I loved that as well. Tonight I went back with a different friend. We ordered the chicken wings and after a few minutes a woman came out and said they hadn't had them in 3 weeks, which isn't true since I had them last Tuesday. Slightly annoying, but whatever. We got the bruschetta with shrimp instead which was phenomenal. I had never seen a bruschetta presentation like that, but I loved it. For dinner I had the drunken noodles with chicken. I wish it would have been spicier, but I'll just ask for it hotter next time. My friend got the BBQ pizza which was amazing. I'll definitely be back every time I'm in town. Big plus: they smoke their own meats so every protein is amazing and they have a wood fire oven for their pizzas. Negative: no wings"}, {"review_id": "NWE0-djZbBp1hzDdHAk4DQ", "user_id": "YgZYVEonuyYIR7Tdn3T8Bg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Very eclectic menu in an artsy neighborhood.  Perfectly fitting for this fun and inviting restaurant.  I was surprised at how different the menu was compared to may restaurants that usually follow a theme or one food style. There is something here for everyone. I also liked that they served fresh popcorn as a starter vs. bread.  They have a wood fire oven for pizza (which I didn't try) however I did order the pork chop which was cooked in the oven and it was delish. Overly sized too. Server did explain to me because of the cooking style it took a little longer to prepare.  Bathrooms were out of order during my visit and they were busy and understaffed. It was just one of those rare occasions that happens. I would go back to try something else on the menu on my next visit to Evansville."}, {"review_id": "AYs925l7IzY0AvQu4eSebQ", "user_id": "aXbE5xBGWhXqVRcrgknSXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/8/2017", "text": "The journey continued. Next stop, bar four: Walton's International Comfort Food. Specifically, the bar upstairs: Fidel's. Again, several people were downstairs in the dining area, with a handful of patrons upstairs in the bar. The bar had a cool eclectic vibe - art decorating the walls, a wooden revolving door at the entrance of the bar, neon lights, and a deer head above the urinal - eclectic. I asked for a beer menu and was handed a four page menu of scotch drinks. The beer menu was limited - so limited, it consisted of just looking through the glass mini-fridge. They had several crafts, one of which was Gerst Amber Ale. This was surprising since it is a rye beer, fairly uncommon among most bar menus I have encountered. One buddy ordered a Seven & Seven, which the bartender said he had never heard of. Seriously? He settled for some girly cocktail with pomegranate juice. We teased him unmercifully because he is 6'2\", 230 pounds, a workout junkie, jujitsu / krav maga powerhouse, drinking a cocktail of some lavender hue - funny shit. My other buddy asked for and was granted a Crown and Coke.We played pool in the billiards area, an enjoyable experience since we had the entire room to ourselves; this was probably a good thing for my buddy, because we never relented off the jokes about his lavender cocktail.After pool, we played table shuffleboard, a new experience for all of us. In a close, hard-fought tourney, I lost by four to my buddy, obviously fueled by anger over our constant jokes."}, {"review_id": "zgjEWuWueNmuWLFEYBv2_g", "user_id": "Oczs8WWm45yVWdn6M32h6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/23/2017", "text": "Last night I went to Walton's with some friends.

Asian fusion + Southern + \"new American\" + barbeque + I'm so confused.A large group of us stopped in before the UE graduation to get our brunch on. My first stop upon arriving there was the bathroom because I'd been living on coffee for the last three days of much driving, and ohhhh boy. There's an upstairs bathroom that I never tried, but the downstairs bathrooms are not okay. They're downstairs in the basement and they smell like, well, what you might expect. On first glance they look great, but then you realize some of the sinks are missing handles. The curtains over the stall doors would be cool if there were any actual doors. So, that's right, you just have a dirty curtain between you and anyone else looking to use the stall. And one of the toilets was broken. Yiiiiiikes.Okay, so, maybe the food is good? Mmmmmmmmm about that.Some people in our group liked their food, some people didn't. Their version of the eggs benedict seemed good, and most people liked the build-your-own-breakfast for the eggs and meat choices. One member of our party ordered toast and it only appeared after asking (but was removed from the check). Another in my party ordered a pancake and wound up with an overdone, tough circle one could charitably call a pancake if there's enough syrup and butter dumped on it.I had the mimosa (mostly orange juice) and the fried chicken and waffles. The waffles were good! The chicken, however, was completely overdone. It was dry, dry, dry. If it wasn't the first major source of protein I'd had in about three days (I mentioned all the driving, yeah?), I wouldn't have even bothered. I guess, for the area, this might be nice? But man, it's trying to do too many different things and ends up doing nothing well."}, {"review_id": "9ahMQD12tF3IHatH5FmQUw", "user_id": "bEHhrFAjc0BkNpJYsbQLXw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "The drinks were good but took to long. The menu is all over the place, so you should be able to find something you like. We had two pizzas, the YAKISOBA beef and yellow curry bowl. All good, but the curry which had indicated one pepper for heat on the menu, was really hot(and I love hot food). The server was very attentive, but it took way to long to get the food. Thought this might be a ploy to sell the expensive cocktails. In defense, the place was packed and the kitchen is small. My second visit in the last year and the experience was the same.

Walton's is typically my go-to spot to take visitors when they come to Evansville. Unfortunately consistency is far from a staple for this restaurant. I'd say my girlfriend and I visit Walton's on a bi-monthly to even weekly basis at times. I have had incredible meals there and the exact opposite of incredible as well. The staff is always pleasant and ready to help in anyway. A very casual vibe, which I absolutely adore. Truly I have only two complaints, but they are crucial if you ask me. 1. The ever changing menu.            I don't think there has been a consistent menu for more than a month. I am a big fan of \"weekend specials\" and things of that nature. The problem I have is that once I find something on the menu that has been consistently good, great even it is inevitably stricken from the menu at some point. 2. The undeniable inconsistency             Unfortunately from working in the restaurant business I know first hand that consistency is key. I am not saying that every time I order a chicken sandwich it should be the same size, taste,  and presentation. I'm all about innovation with food for the better, but for the worse I am not a fan. Unfortunately this seems to be a trend at Walton's. Whomever is in the expo position or heading up the kitchen really needs to get a lock on this issue. To sum up. Go! Everyone in Evansville or the surrounding area should try this wonderful local eatery. I have a big love for Walton's and I feel like that is why I am so critical. Neither of these issues have kept me from returning. Like I said there have been months which I've visited Walton's each week. Get the Korean Duck Wings and the Fried Green Tomatoes. Absolutely enjoy a hand crafted cocktail. Please do yourself a favor and enjoy a delicious tart as well. I hope Walton's sticks around for a very long time."}, {"review_id": "S49iJCc0OY1zJXRcC3NeAg", "user_id": "xm6QFeXwDOitkEc3Ae_IwA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Great food from a qualified chef.  Everything here is made from scratch and it stands out.  My wife and I have dined here twice so far are will absolutely be back for more.  We love the chicken rice bowl (with smoked chicken), friend green tomatoes and my wife said the catfish was the best she had ever eaten.  I love the rustic atmosphere and decor also.  Great service with personable staff as well."}, {"review_id": "8fnWEtoMTx58RrKFY7AS2g", "user_id": "_V1v1Ez_b1L6oBglnEyKEQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/17/2016", "text": "What a well oiled machine!  This place is legit- friendly customer service- everyone says hello and thanks you for coming in, food is delightful, the inside space has an eclectic feel but not annoyingly hipster if that makes sense.

I have previously made my way through their Asian offerings but today I went for breakfast and it did not disappoint. The chicken and waffles was PERFECT- I have never had such wonderfully cooked chicken, it practically melted when I cut into it. The Creole scramble was very delicious but heavy - maybe not a good idea to order both these items to try at the same time! The southern eggs Benedict was wonderful - the tomato gravy sauce is one of my favorite things I've ever had in my life. Walton's just never disappoints. The only criticism I have is that breakfast and brunch hours don't overlap much and we arrived at 10:30 but couldn't order from the brunch menu till 11. Both of them last till 2 pm so I feel that they should extend brunch to start at 9 am with breakfast to give people more options if they aren't feeling breakfast.

The downside - my in-laws food was not that great.  Half of what my father-in-law ordered was not available by the time the food came out.
