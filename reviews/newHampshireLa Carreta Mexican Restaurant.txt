Me and my family when out to dinner here not too long ago. I chose this place because it was recommended to me by a coworker. I was happy we went.The atmosphere was very cool including a wishing fountain in the middle of the restaurant. Very casual place .  Bright colors and mosaics. The staff were nice. Very much getting the job down fast and efficient. Not much chatting other than taking outlet orders. The food was really good I got the mole enchiladas. I enjoy a good mole!  It seemed like it may not have been enough food but honestly was more than enough! Everything was fresh and flavorful. Not complaints. Ballin on a budget! The food is not expensive here so if you are looking for authentic Mexican at a lower cost this is your place. Overall I would good back. It was very busy for a Sunday when I went so maybe a different day if you like things on the more quiet side."}, {"review_id": "Izs8_VJNHdJg1zlYXBjcrw", "user_id": "PCjKoGmBixzpmkD4LLFqOg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "We walked in the door at 8:35. I know that because I sent a text to someone as we were walking in the door. The place was crowded, so when he said it was about a 30 min wait it seemed reasonable. 45 minutes later we were still waiting but so was one other couple that came in before us so we said we must be soon... 20 min later that couple was gone. We MUST be next... 2 guys walked in off the street and got a table instantly. The other host noticed us with our WTF faces on and said \"oh! Did he not offer you a little table?\" Uuuuh no??? Can we get one?? So he takes us to a table for 2 in a crowded corner. Instantly we were surrounded by children that weren't being supervised, bumping into us, yelling and just being unsupervised kids... After all that waiting, we decided to just leave and never come back."}, {"review_id": "_PGTEPBWgGnDRKWdJaBSmg", "user_id": "c0fz7DyLB9spISlNbnlSLQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "We love La Carreta. This is the most authentic Mexican restaurant in the area and everything about it is great. The food is cheap, service is great, and you never have to wait long for a table even on a busy weekend night.We always start with the beef nachos, which are amazing. It's loaded with seasoned beef and a ton of cheese. I cannot even explain why these nachos are so much better than any other nachos out there. Definitely give these a shot, a real sleeper on the menu. Other favorites are the chimichangas, enchiladas, and  tacos. You really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.Our most recent waiter, Victor, was great. All the employees work very hard and you can tell they care about the restaurant and customers.

This time I tried Vegetarian F, for variety and thought the name was appropriate. The mashed potato enchilada is interesting. I really didn't like the spinach burrito ( not fresh spinach, I should have asked) or mushroom (and American sliced cheese?) quesadilla.  Very bland and salty.  IThe sauce tasted like Chef Boyardee sauce.  The other five people I was dining with were happy with their meals.  We've been to La Carreta many times, the one meal I didn't like isn't enough to drop my review below five stars given the many good meals I've had there."}, {"review_id": "Nu6VrW22rWKG1XOSDs3gtA", "user_id": "6r9ILCTCuEx_1Pbv6ilhcg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "The prices here are on the high side but it is one of the more popular Mexican restaurants- Went In the day after cinco de mayo and the place was packed, loud bar which spilled into the dining area, The was a wait but the hostess didn't speak much English so Instead of waiting, we left and went to La Hacienda and enjoyed a quiet reasonably priced meal with wonderful service."}, {"review_id": "xBnHAzl6Xc_Nbf3FHhHwww", "user_id": "zoQwKvJIgV88r43KDKoEYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "For me, they never ever mess up the steak tacos.

I have been to all of their locations, but the Nashua one is by far my favorite. The food is consistent - always delicious and really fast. I am really happy with their vegetarian selection as well. In my picture is the vegetarian F, which consists of one spinach burrito, one mashed potato enchilada an one mushroom quesadilla. I have probably gotten this over 10 times and it is always wonderful. Also pictured is a jalapeño margarita but had fresh jalapeño. Very spicy but very delicious.

Appetizers were delivered and within a few mins our meals came. Not a big deal....but I felt a bit rushed. And the restaurant wasn't crowded, it was a Monday night. Being new to the area, I've heard it's a popular spot so I'm going to assume they are just very efficient at food delivery.  Food was good. Homemade chips and salsa were tasty. I had chicken tacos on soft corn tortillas. Those were good too. We had house margaritas, which were a tad watery for my taste.

I don't think I'm a good judge of how \"authentic\" this place is, but is sure it delicious. Complementary bottomless warm chips and salsa are a great way to my heart. The salsa was not spicy or chunky, so it was not my favorite, although it was definitely a crowd pleaser. I was happy with my steak chimichangas and my friend was very pleased with her chicken fajitas. We also has strawberry margaritas, which hit the spot. No patio/outdoor seating. Handicap accessible. Extensive menu includes options for everyone, including kids and vegetarians. Definite downside: It was very loud and absolutely swarming with children. I also found the service to be less-than-attentive. Bottom line: I would return for a yummy meal but definitely would not come here on a date or for any occasion other than a casual lunch with a friend or two."}, {"review_id": "ctbqr-j1w6Tga5G9H4LYgQ", "user_id": "EDrGzGzios5RvmrtT7vC3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Best Mexican restaurant I've been to.

It can be tough to find parking when they are busy, and the wait can sometimes be a bit long. If you can squeeze into their little bar area, you can bide your time with drinks until your table is ready. Once seated, you'll get your bottomless chips and salsa pretty quickly and the table service is fast. Only once has the waiter messed up my order, but it was fixed right away. As for the menu, their margaritas are big and strong - if you're driving, pace yourself. I prefer their \"hot sauce\" to the salsa that you get with the chips and have to request it. It really is pretty spicy, but I prefer the zip.  I usually get a combo to mix it up, but I absolutely LOVE their enchilada sauce. I'm not sure what they put in it, (nutmeg?), but it is wonderful! If I could buy the enchilada sauce to make my own enchiladas at home, I'd do it in a heartbeat!"}, {"review_id": "SKtcWPcDAMDMxDtXg2NeZQ", "user_id": "YbKj5VN43MDB7LR5gWU1Sw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "Great, consistent restaurant chain. Been going here for probably 18+ years. A huge range of options on the menu. Love the long list of $10 buck meals, great when you want a nice sit down meal on a Mc Donald's budget. Plus if you have enough to splurge on a nicer meal you can get something really good and satisfying like the seafood meals-yum!Best freshly made WARM chips & salsa-yum! You can make a meal out of them. I heard the drinks are great from friends who order them. It is ALL good so you can't miss on any menu selection. The customer service is consistently nice and swift. I like the Mexican decor. When it's really packed, it can be a little loud but bearable. Nice smooth mint on your way out the door. I've been to the other sister stores (2 in Manchester) and they are each slightly different/still good --but this Nashua one is my Favorite and most people I know who are fans of the chain are usually talking about the Nashua business.Just a heads up that the restaurant has its own hours like a siesta period so they may not be open during the day time hours you might be expecting."}, {"review_id": "1sSYI3HMNbRdXuBS2Z8rYg", "user_id": "8QSKG48ghaGUZihK_EII3Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/8/2017", "text": "The service was slow today.

Get here early or visit during non peak hours because this place is ALWAYS packed and there's always a long wait.  Luckily for us, we scored seats at the bar so we were able to munch on the delicious house chips and salsa and ordered some Sol beer while we waited for for our table (75 mins)The questo fondito is absolutely delicious! It's a cheesy white dip with ground chorizo, it was so good, we got two.  The guac is just OK.The menu is quite lengthy and its hard to decided what to order. Luckily there are combination plates with one of everything or you can also opt for a la carte and build your own Mexican platter.The fried chicken burrito was delicious and the beef tamale was the best I've ever had.Parking is tough during peak hours (as you cannot park in the Wendy's lot). Prices are really reasonable. The restaurant is so busy that it can get kinda loud so if you are looking for a quiet romantic date night, this probably won't be your best bet.I totally recommend this to friends, couples, families of all ages and business meals."}, {"review_id": "udAK92lcI16vgWVo0azAVQ", "user_id": "YWMUGOfYvGNMkSe-0VdvFw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Visited La Carreta today and it was mobbed to say the least. Was seated right away by the door that kept opening which made it so cold we had to eat with our coats on. The waitress seemed overwhelmed or not a care in the world so it was over 10 mins before she even came over to ask us what we wanted to drink. If the restaurant is that busy and the staff can't keep up you shouldn't just seat people. My fiancé and I ordered steak tacos which tasted fine at the time, but two hours later started experiencing food poisoning! Won't be visiting here again! I find that the Manchester & Hooksett locations are much better with the food and service!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-carreta-mexican-restaurant-nashua-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
