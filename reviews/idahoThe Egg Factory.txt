I stopped here before heading to the airport to catch a flight back to Baltimore. The reason I stopped here?  Yelp reviews. This place reminds you of your grandmother's house. It hasn't had a remodel since 1985 but the warmth and food is amazing and comforting. I was waiting for my food when I had serious food envy on other people getting their food. That's a good thing.  The menu is a bit confusing because it doesn't tell you EXACTLY what you are getting, so I had to ask the waitress. You are getting 2 eggs with your main breakfast pick. For instance: I was looking at \"The Cattleman\" and it just said \"half pound patty of angus ground beef\". It comes with 2 eggs (cooked to order) and your choice of pancakes, buttermilk biscuit, toast, etc)Everything was really good."}, {"review_id": "6dehVsLQz_XhRso3g4QwYQ", "user_id": "P7dRqYNjG3-0IXtulSdlfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "We were driving through on I84 and wanted a Sunday morning diner breakfast stop. This place was Perfect. Cozy and warm - no booths, just tables and cute rooster art.  The place was filled with the sounds of happy locals eating. We were right by the kitchen as you couldn't hear anything from inside, just dishes of patrons. It was full when we got there but we only had to wait 5 min or so for a table. The menu is extensive and and really well priced. We got the garden crepe and biscuits and gravy and French toast crunch and sourdough bread and everything was phenomenal! Really nice pretty big portions (especially on the chicken fried steak the table next to us had - it looked enormous!). The French toast crunch was awesome- no need for syrup and it came with really lovely raspberry sauce. Not giant pieces, but not small. It heavier than normal French toast and delicious. They have hash browns and traditional breakfast potatoes (the little squares) - I got both. The hash was good, but the potatoes were perfect. Perfect crunch - didn't even need ketchup or anything. Went amazing with the gravy. The crepe was fantastic, really fresh veggies in it (two of them) and the biscuits & gravy was a really big portion and sooo good.  The server was fantastic - really attentive and super nice. She was sassy with us,  but we also are young and give off that vibe and that was fantastic with us. She was cool :) Basically, this is a small, homey diner with utterly fantastic food, friendly, attentive staff a small town feel and good prices. A+++ Will definitely go again when we pass through next time. :)"}, {"review_id": "p2TU4exiXwoNp5bRNVNxWA", "user_id": "KL9Nd7F1C_avfKbHD-7izg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/15/2016", "text": "Came in for a quick breakfast before work and they were able to sit us down quickly.

I'm not much of a breakfast food person but the place came recommended from a friend.

It was delicious, home cooked fried with melted Swiss cheese and sautéed mushrooms. Good stuff.

The eggs scrambled with sausage, delish! The gravy drenched hashbrowns, delish! The sausage, delish! I opted for a biscuit on the side, amazeballs!!My friend ordered the Eggs Benedict, looked amazing, and said it was really good.

I ordered a taco salad. I'd eaten about 1/3 of the salad when I found a napkin in the salad. I gave the salad back to the waiter, who said the chef really apologized. I got some french fries instead of a replacement salad. When I got the bill, I was still charged for the salad, but I got a \"cook's mistake\" discount and a senior discount on the bill. Both of those discounts didn't add up to the price of the salad. I was taking my mother and sister on a shopping day, so I decided to not make a big deal out of this issue. However, I think it was poor customer service to still charge me for the salad. The food was marginal--my sister had a chicken salad, and my mom had a chicken burger. Maybe their breakfast food is better, but their lunch is unremarkable. I won't be going back."}, {"review_id": "tnsW4hOJSvB5VEjsbyrhOw", "user_id": "jQmN8c8EB6-cBEan7pbBWg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "10/28/2016", "text": "No way this place is rated as high as it is.
