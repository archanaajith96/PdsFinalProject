This place is only 10-minute's drive off I-40 W. It seems to me this one is the best on Kingston Pike, which I feel like is home to a lot of ethnic food. Wait to be seated after you follow the sign and enter from the front entrance. When you finish, you will need to take your check and pay at the window at the entrance. You may need to stand and wait in line to pay when it's busy. The inside is quite spacious. And it's clean with a score of 99 from Tennessee Department of Health. The service is good and speedy. The food is good, too. I had 11B pho (beef brisket and tendon) and the Vietnamese pork sandwich, which is #34. Both are among the best I've had. I can see why it's popular on Yelp Knoxville."}, {"review_id": "060FGpEdEBpdd2s6-dsN5Q", "user_id": "IvxD-4CKxsFQVvRdeXT6ww", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Came here for lunch with a friend. Had a crazy craving for pho around 10am and this place was opened \"earlier\" than other Vietnamese joints so we decided to give it a try. Started our meal with their banh mi Dac biet and that definitely hit the spot!! Bread was nice, warm and toasty and there was a good amount of meats, pickled veggies, pate and French mayo . Unfortunately, I wasn't as pleased with the pho. The broth was just way too sweet for my liking and the broth wasn't hot enough...came out rather lukewarm. The brisket I ordered with it also tasted kind of old :(Definitely recommend the banh mi though! I'd for sure come back here to satisfy my banh my cravings!SERVICE IS AWESOME TOO BTW!

But Pho is a unique dish with some interesting and odd flavors. It's also difficult to eat unless you know how to use chopsticks. Pho is a big soup with different meats like brisket and meatballs maybe fattier and rarer than you might desire. The bowl is mostly rice noodles but you could get a different type of noodle. Mint, cilantro and hot peppers make for an interesting mix of spices. Personally this is something I could eat maybe once or twice a year.

I was able to peek more into the kitchen as I was placing and paying for my order. I will not get into details because I don't want anybody getting in trouble.... but man, how do they get away with some of the things they do?Anyway, back to my good. Banh mi was good. Too much liquid seasoning, and no jalapeños... but still good. Smoothies were excellent! Not too sweet, done right and the amount you get for the money is amazing.

If this restaurant was in Atlanta (where I'm from), I'd give it a 3 just because there are a lot of better Vietnamese restaurants around. I'm not familiar with Knoxville, but I'm going to make the assumption that the Vietnamese food scene isn't as good. Bida Saigon seems pretty authentic and legit, so I'll give them 4 stars because I'm guessing they're one of the better Vietnamese places in the city.We stopped through Knoxville on our road trip back to Atlanta and I found this hole in the wall thanks to Yelp. Some of us were feeling a bit under the weather and pho was ideal.Like a lot of authentic Vietnamese joints, Bida Saigon is no-frills. There's no fancy decor or real ambiance to speak of. Just a kitchen, payment window (kind of odd), an open-layout dining room (all tables), and a couple pool tables in the front. As is customary at pho restaurants, each table comes equipped with chopsticks, soup spoons, small dishes for sauce and whatnot, and condiments like Sriracha and hoisin sauce.The restaurant offers about 10 different kinds of pho (Vietnamese beef noodle soup) in one size only, priced at $8.50 to $10 per bowl. Aside from pho, you can also get a variety of Vietnamese appetizers (mostly various rolls, $3.50 for two), banh xeo (Vietnamese crepe, $8.50), bun bo Hue (Hue-style noodle soup, $9), hu tieu (pork noodle soup, $8.50-9), bun (vermicelli noodles, $8.50), com (rice dishes $9), and banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches, $4.50 each).I started off with a #3 nem nuong cuon ($3.50). This app consists of two rice paper rolls filled with grilled pork, lettuce, and noodles with a side of fish sauce. The type of noodles used are white rice vermicelli noodles. These rolls are prepared and served at room temp. The ingredients were fresh and the quality was good. The rolls were very tasty and I recommend them. One order is good for two people. I wish the nuoc mam was spicier, but I think they've toned it down for the American palate (less chili peppers).I ordered the #7 \"big bowl combo\" ($10) for my entree. This is essentially Bida Saigon's version of pho dac biet which is commonly referred to in English as special combination pho (or some variant of that). In other words, pho with everything. At Bida Saigon, that means meatballs (beef), tendon, rare beef, and brisket. Unfortunately, they do not include one of my favorite pho dac biet ingredients: tripe. That was disappointing. The pho was OK. Not great, not bad. The broth wasn't memorable and the quality of ingredients was fine. If I ever came back, I'd probably try one of the bun bo Hue, bun, or com dishes instead of pho.I was happy to see they included all the good pho sides: basil, culantro, bean sprouts, jalapeno, and lime. Fresh and yummy.One of my friends ordered a banh mi and devoured it. He said he liked it.Service was great.

Decent instead of delicious simply because I wanted a vegetarian Pho and it was in a beef broth. When asked about it the server stated it HAD to be beef based otherwise it would just be clear water. Anyway....There were also zero vegetables inside this dish. Just broth, onion & tofu. We had to request mint, peppers, sprouts & lime which is typically standard delivery with Pho. Nonetheless the Pho was good. As we're the Shrimp Spring Rolls. Anyway....The service was decent, nothing to write home about. The dining room was spacious with lots of seating suitable for the entire family.

We start off with vegetarian spring rolls which oddly aren't on the menu but certainly do exist. The two rolls are plump and packed with veggies and rice noodles and come with a delicious peanut dipping sauce. But the real kicker is their Phö, which you can order in about any fashion, but I always go for the tofu. I load it up with plenty of jalapeños and basil and a bit of the chili oil that they have on the table (admittedly, I'm not sure what's in it or what it's called but it has a great kick that keeps my nose running throughout the meal). I've tried the beef options once or twice and have to say that it's better, but not by much. Really the only difference is the fat that is lacking in the tofu bowl which creates a bit more depth for the beef bowl. The restaurant itself seems more of a communal kitchen, or even a church kitchen, but that suits me just fine. There are some pool tables in the front that I've never seen used or racked up and there are two or three tv's to stare at if that's your cup of tea, but for the most part it's a quiet environment with one or two servers serving the 10+ table dining area. I was glad we found Buds Saigon last winter as it satisfied a craving for a hot bowl of soup or broth on more than one occasion, and I even went in once when I was sick to try and open my sinuses up with chilis and hot liquids. It worked."}, {"review_id": "zfm-IluSz_qlObVGRZkRJg", "user_id": "SdzmQFnT0nYCZfFvoBTOGg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/22/2017", "text": "Bida Saigon is my go-to place for summer rolls.

I am not one to really seek out pho, but when me and my friend go, we generally order one order of summer rolls, a bowl of pho with an extra empty bowl, and one bahn-mi sandwich and split everything. I am always surprised by how much I really like the pho. The extra add-ins they bring and have on the table are really great. Their chili sauce is spicy and amazing. If you like bah-mi sandwiches, theirs are really good. The ingredients are fresh and the bread is crisp. Also, they are really cheap! However, this is a place to go and savor flavorful food.
