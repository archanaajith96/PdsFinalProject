El Bajio did not disappoint! This sit-down taco spot hits all the marks - free (warm) chips and salsa with a kick when you sit down. Expansive menu that truly has something for anyone, and delicious homemade tortillas... what else do you even need in life? You need the chorizo tacos, that's what you need. Because choices are hard and research is important, I decided to order one of each kind of taco, Mexican style my favorite was easily the chorizo - often, chorizo can be greasy or not cooked properly, but the chefs at El Bajio know what they're doing. It was perfectly crispy and flavorful without being dry. I also really, really enjoyed the pastor tacos, so those would be my top two recommendations if you're having trouble making a decision. Hope to try that pineapple margarita other Yelpers are talking about  during a return trip!"}, {"review_id": "qYFlxfE4n3TPGC4Oy9norA", "user_id": "RJw5WkFp6eMjTZYnt3saTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "First I would like to start with saying the salsa may be one of the best I have ever had. Chips are so light and crisp.I ordered carnitas tacos and my husband ordered shrimp in garlic sauce. Tacos we're good but I found very large pieces of fat and they were each topped with a large amount of onion. Beans and rice were standard.My husband's shrimp were perfect, it came with lettuce and rice and tortillas. I thought it was pretty good. I would come back and try other things."}, {"review_id": "eOqkSfMwVf7JvCHjuk84hA", "user_id": "LtdPmuS4_Vb1fTL8sN8Igw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Wow. What a surprising and wonderful meal I just had at El Bajio. I've waited a long time to finally make my way up to Cedar Rapids for some tasty Mexican food. The wait was worth it. I'll certainly be back. The chips and salsa were better than at a typical Mexican restaurant with warm chips and thick, flavorful salsa. I tried a Mexican style pastor taco, which had heaps of fresh onion and cilantro. Yum.However, the star of the show was the taco salad. Lame right? I  assumed I was making a mistake by getting the most Americanized form of a taco, but they execute it really well at El Baijo. Crispy tortilla shell, really flavorful and cheesy chicken, crisp lettuce and onions, and a large scoop of guacamole. I ate the entire thing, passing well beyond the food wall. Make the trip to El Bajio. It's worth it!"}, {"review_id": "DqvlH1WBt55Sljg7fZXbvg", "user_id": "JC8jXE_sdIdMwP6Z7rIQNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "I have found that good Mexican is incredibly hard to come by. Most Mexican restaurants just seem to be average with the emphasis on safe, bland, nothing special.  El Bajio is none of that. This is going to sound dramatic, there is your warning. In the city of Cedar Rapids, a city that is desperately in need of good Mexican food... this place is a revelation.  I warned you that it was a dramatic statement.The tortilla chips were warm and crisp. The salsa, provided with them, was bottomless and incredibly tasty.  But, how was the food?  Let's be honest. Anybody can put out good chips and salsa. The food. That is what separates a good Mexican restaurant from something which is just a couple of steps above Taco Bell. I am here to tell you that the food was amazing. First of all, let's talk about portions. My meal had enough left over that I was able to eat both lunch and dinner, the next day, with it.  Not only was it plentiful, the Chori Pollo was simply the best I have ever had.  That chorizo!  O. M. G. From start to finish, the entire experience was wonderful.  I think it is safe to say that I have found my new favorite restaurant in the area"}, {"review_id": "cH6P916oz7dQd9JXBPn98A", "user_id": "KaYZLa6rP422xwVGZV4Dew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Best authentic Mexican food in Cedar Rapids!!!!

I HAD to have tacos because a) I love tacos and b) I was completing a social media challenge for one of my favorite charity organizations. We arrived with the intention of ordering to go, but the owner greeted us and it wasn't nearly as loud as last time, so we decided we'd dine in :) Service definitely has room to grow, but it's not bad. The pattern just seems to be that once you get your food, you're given a little too much space and getting the check takes a while. We had a different young man this time who seemed very nervous, but his personal recommendation when I asked which meat I should try? Pastor - they were DELICIOUS. All the entrees we've tried have been awesome. We even had dessert this time, which was very tasty as well."}, {"review_id": "h0cpjCU3kwJOjuayuzRI_w", "user_id": "eoyks30RpAwb4QdC_aJSkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Stopped in here the night before a flight home from a business trip last week - what a great choice!The young server was very friendly/attentive and kept an eye out for our quickly disappearing bowl of chips and salsa (freshly made). The pineapple smoked margarita was excellent - a great blend of sour from the pineapple, tequila kick and blended spices.The Enchilada Mineras was hand's down the best Mexican dish that I've ever tasted. Corn tortillas, queso, homemade sauce - sooo good.The green and red hot sauces were clearly homemade with stickers showing the date that it was made (the day before).Everything just had a fresh, homemade taste and you could tell that they take great pride in their food.I will make sure that I return on my next business trip.

Mexican cuisine is our favorite. We took a vote whether we wanted authentic or Tex-Mex type food, and opted for authentic. Then we read through reviews and menus, and decided on El Bajio. When we got there, we honestly didn't expect too much. It is in a part of town with a lot of strip mall type buildings, and it is sort of in an alley. The outside was simple, and we were not sure what the inside would hold. It was actually really nice inside. They did a great job with the decorating and atmosphere. We ordered Dipping Chimis for an appetizer, and they were amazing. They also came with a dipping sauce that had spinach, tomato, onion, sour cream, and possibly ranch. I thought it was strange at first, but it is actually perfect with the chimis. For our main courses, my husband got a carnitas burrito, and I got Tacos Dorados with potatoes, and fideo. My husband loved his burrito. He thought the carnitas was cooked an seasoned really well. He like the tortilla. It was also gigantic, so he took half of it home for another meal. My food was also great. The Tacos Dorados was an appetizer, so I though it would be small. It was actually three full size tacos, and then queso fresco, salad, and some sauce. I really liked the fideo. It had a subtle flavor, and I would order it again. El Bajio is a place we will return to. There were some really unique things on the menu that I would like to try. The decor was nice, the wait staff was excellent, and the prices were very low for the quality of the food. I can see this becoming a regular place for us."}, {"review_id": "Vknqo_cdpWB6TVvCuSTVrQ", "user_id": "ZwV80EfZmVbeflc_Q6NOMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Brought the family here and have picked up takeout a few times now. My husband sticks with the beef fajitas and enjoys them each time. Our kids usually request the table side guacamole each visit. I like that since they make it tableside you could have it chunky or smooth and spicy or mild. We also usually get the cheese dip and enjoy that it is not too salty. Our daughter usually orders some sort of seafood dish and has never been disappointed. My favorite dish is the carnitas and I like them with extra pico de gallo on the side. The frozen margaritas are great and perfect amount of alcohol. I like that the drinks are not too strong. Each visit the place is crazy busy and must be a testament to how great the food and service is.

I found real Mexican food in Iowa! Thank you El Bajio....my search is over. I moved here from Idaho 10 months ago, and have tried every single Mexican eatery in the Quad Cities. Ahhhhhhhhh...Tex-Mex, gringo, predictably average at best. Let me explain...Idaho gets lots and lots of California transplants, and is agriculturally driven. When these two factors unite...you get California style Mexican food! El Bajio is just that! Real Cali style through and through!Carnitas!

At best this place is average Mexican food.  I chose to order from the menu, not opting for the $9.95 lunch buffet. I got a chili relleno & beef taco, both had average flavor. The problem with my relleno was they left the seeds in the poblano pepper, yuck, who wants to wade through 500 seeds to eat the last 20%???  Come on. The taco meat had little flavors, no tomatoes, C-  !!!  My wife got s chicken enchilada & Beef tostada same lack of pizazz and flavors. The enchilada was a mass of chicken with no cheese inside and little flavor. I think we would have been better at a fast food mexican than here.
