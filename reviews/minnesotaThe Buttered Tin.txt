It was busy as usual during brunch time  Taherah waited on me and kept my coffee mug filled. The loaded hashbrowns had this great orange pork. The server brought it out so fast I thought they must zap pre-made plates. But no- it was so fresh and scrumptious I almost sighed while enjoying it And Taherah! She made me feel like I was the only one in the room.On my way out I stopped at a nearby table Teherah seemed to linger at ever so slightly. It was her mom and sister. I shared my admiration of customer service exemplified and they replied \"We know- isn't she great?!\"Indeed she is and so is everyone working the front and back of this gem."}, {"review_id": "DUUMHBoBCH5h3xDQSSjFCA", "user_id": "ZFlkcEWXCk8Bq728R9PBxg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I made a mistake coming here I didn't realize they are big on breakfast and not much for lunch.

The place is a little smaller than I expected and the interior has minimal decor and there isn't a particular theme they have going on inside. Food: The \"loaded\" hash browns I got were pretty disappointing, especially since the side salad was a bit random and didn't pair well with the dish. I wouldn't get it again. I also got a small pastry to nibble on while we were waiting for our table. It was a bit dry and not memorable. My friend got the biscuits and gravy and I had a bite. It was average/nothing special. I don't think I'd go back as there are so many better brunch options in the Twin Cities with better flare and food."}, {"review_id": "sACsL2jmAtaB7rOwYyITww", "user_id": "kQC3hb9cE-BImCloj8e4MQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Very great menu!

The overall vibe reminded me of Cafe Patachou (also focused on fresh, local sourcing, etc.) in IN. There was a surprisingly long line. Given the high volume of positive reviews, I expected more. Maybe because I didn't sit down & try their \"traditional\" brunch food. We got the: *Fresh Cinnamon Rolls - these were fresh & good, but not the best I've had. I think it was mainly a texture thing for me. The best cinnamon rolls have a fluffy yet gooey texture. The Buttered Tin's version wasn't quite there yet. *Housemade Granola - Eh. Purely Elizabeth granola was better than this.*Coffee - nothing to write home about. I'd be back to give The Buttered Tin a second chance, but there are so many spots in town so it might take me a while to circle back. 98/365"}, {"review_id": "C0pGVNIn8U3X-3k99YAFbQ", "user_id": "KgsfVkhgWtSYL-0_us9Jfg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Warm breakfast in a real cold place really hit the spot. Stopped by for some breakfast and left with a full belly of goodness. Decor-a bit plane inside and nothing special. Large windows for lots of natural lighting which is milico needed in this cold town. Service-girls behind counter seemed ok, nothing overly nice or welcoming. They were simply ok. Food-OJ was very good, freshly squeezed and just right amount of sweetness. Biscuits and gravy were boldly different, which I appreciated. Biscuits were fluffy and warm, gravy had interesting flavor and what was really the key factor was the pickled onions. They put the whole plate together, good call on that chef. Cinnamon roll was the star of the show and was awesome! It was warm and topped with great cream cheese frosting and it was fabulous. Don't look forward to going back to such a cold place, but if I do, I'll be back here for cinnamon roll."}, {"review_id": "LbcTci3mLXikb4N1dwF3-Q", "user_id": "wclVetoFJ5nZx3o0Vm5a2Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "I REALLY wanted to love this place, and took advantage of a couple of open hours on a early  weekday morning before work to try it since I knew how busy it gets on weekends.  First of all, the space itself is a bit more basic than I expected, but it has a lot of great windows and both tables and booths available.  You order at the counter, and then have a seat.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy, coffee, and then because the smell of bacon was everywhere, and smelled SO good,  I just needed to get a side order of that too.  So...I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed with the biscuits and gravy :(. It came to the table and looked fantastic!  But then I took a bite and I was so confused for a minute.  It was so sweet!  At first I thought it was the biscuits, or the pickled onions they put on top, but it wasn't...it was the gravy.  The biscuits were pretty good, and generously sized, and you get two of them.  The poached eggs are the most beautifully prepared poached eggs I think I've ever seen!  But the gravy was just extremely sweet and I couldn't eat it :(. That said, the side order of bacon was delicious, and they have some very good coffee as well. Maybe others prefer a sweet version of their gravy, but I am definitely a savory person in this case, so this is just my opinion.  As far as overall impression, it's a nice place, and the service was good as well.  The bakery items looked good as well, but didn't try those yet.  Would I come back?  Honestly I don't know.  I won't rule it out because I know there were things I didn't try yet, and maybe those are amazing."}, {"review_id": "i0CESxMnX_7uCPN5htD4bA", "user_id": "5u6QNQmmdyeV8SAIFtNd8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "As noted, the waiting area is sparse and you definitely feel like you're in the way.

The biscuits and gravy were delicious - tons of flavor and the biscuits were giant. Usually it's a plate of gravy that can't come close to being all eaten, but I actually could have used just a teensy bit more gravy thanks to those giant biscuits.

Located in lower town, it's popular on the weekends. We walked in expecting to sit and order but were told it'd be a 40 minute wait.......No big deal, we grabbed a cup of joe from the counter service along with a fresh baked peanut butter sandwich cookie. The coffee was great and the cookie was ridiculous. It was so soft and chewy and peanut-buttery. I'll come back just for that!The ambiance is diner-esque. Servers hustling and bustling with coffee carafes and water jugs. After about 20 minutes we were seated and enjoyed a window view. It was cold and crummy outside but warm and cozy inside. Our server came by toting a smile and a notepad. We ordered right away. Biscuits and gravy, hash browns and the perfect breakfast sandwich. Everything was just right. Biscuits and gravy can be good, bad and ugly. These suckers were great, delicious and beautiful! The presentation was colorful and the taste was piping with flavor and super light. The pickled shallots were an amazing rush of flavor mixed with a warm and creamy sausage gravy. The biscuits would have been perfect dry and alone, but everything's better with friends and this big old biscuit had some amazing friends. A pair of perfectly poached eggs drenched in gravy. I'm still drooling. Order these and you will leave satisfied. As for the sandwich......well I make a pretty solid breakfast sandwich, so when I saw the basic bread, egg, bacon and cheese I was not immediately impressed. After one bite I realized it was perfect. Salty, chewy, crunchy and the eggs were excellent. Another home run. We will be back and have zero issues with waiting 40+ minutes for such an amazing meal."}, {"review_id": "6Vdg3mH7Pjpae1iVD6BV9Q", "user_id": "uRgAL9v1PSVlmoY7VKlc4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "Come here for the cinnamon rolls and stay for the breakfast entrees. Omg I loved the food here! I was slightly hungover and debated on whether I should get the cinnamon roll on top of another plate. In my weak state of mind I made the best decision of the day. The cinnamon roll tastes like a million bucks. Warm, crispy edges, and cream cheese that has you asking for me. If you don't have room in your belly while you're there get it to go. On top of that I ordered the pigs eye breakfast with hash browns and sausage. My fiancé got the breakfast sandwich. Both were spectacular! My Hash browns were crispy and sausage was uniquely sweet. The thick whole grain toast with just the right amount of jelly spread on hit the spot. I only had one bite of the egg sandwich but I loved the addition of mayo and onions for something different. The service was unusually slow but the manger came over to apologize when she delivered our food to say the kitchen was a backed up. I can deal with bad service if it's acknowledged. Tip - it starts getting crowded around 10 am on the weekends so get there early"}, {"review_id": "7n6x0PpsgjJ3FOklWrkbWg", "user_id": "o51mY5dByTXx5T1TQ3VbLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/15/2017", "text": "Being a st paul native and a breakfast lover any time of day, I'm kind of embarrassed it took so long to discover BT.Being the first tine, my wife and I decided to share and try everything that looked good.

Service continued to be great throughout our meal and we received our drinks, ordered, and got our food very quickly. Tried the Buttered Tin Hash and Pancakes and both were amazing. The pancakes were served with maple bacon butter which was a perfect pairing to the buttermilk pancakes. The hash was an excellent savory dish with salmon, fresh corn off the cob, squash and potatoes. This was topped off with two giant slices of toast and jam. I definitely didn't leave hungry. Overall TBT was a great experience. I loved the menu. Wasn't too large, but had a great selection of sweet and savory options.

Trust me, on most days the wait time is so long, we just decide to find other places. Today I had an agenda to have my breakfast here. This place has featured in a lot of lists of some of the best brunch places in Twin cities, and I really wanted to know why. Our Order - Cinnamon roll with cream cheese, Buttermilk pancakes and Huevos rancheros, Hash brown and yes coffee : ) ( Sunday morning 9am) The cinnamon roll with the cream cheese was brilliant! You need to be a cinnamon fan though, loads of cinnamon and really sweet. My husband ordered the huevos rancheros and it was really good too. The right amount of flavors and crunch, the eggs were perfectly poached. I loved my pancakes even better. It was salted, and a little different from the ones I have had at the other brunch places. The maple syrup and butter added the sweetness you want of a pancake. I will give this pancake a perfect 5/5. The coffee was okay, I've had better. The hash brow was good too. Overall things I loved about the place - Service, ambience, menu ( they have a lot of choices, something I always like), ample street parking. Why am I still giving it 4 stars over 5? - This place is good, but is it worth those really long wait time, and is it one the best brunch places in Minneapolis? I don't think so."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-buttered-tin-saint-paul?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
