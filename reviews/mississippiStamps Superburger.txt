I really enjoyed the greasy, messy, fresh, and flavorful burger. Paired with the Sweet potatoes fries, this is one of those rare meals I will dream about. I'd love to know what they season the burger with and when the last time they changed their fryer grease was. (Don't take that the wrong way. I'm a firm believer that you can filter grease and add to it and the flavor just gets better and better. I was warned that this may not be in the best neighborhood, but if your not scared of a little southern charm it's worth the trip."}, {"review_id": "EPMUdrhpOV9fZisklSiOCg", "user_id": "Kvz7LooABb5Zt5UL0zizIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "I drove up to Stamps and smiled immediately. I'm an old soul, one who has a fondness for nostalgia. I could imagine myself growing up in Mississippi, coming here for an occasional treat with my folks. I would listen in awe at the stories shared between the regulars of the Deli Mart and the Stamps family; and marvel at the deliciousness being prepared.The building is rather vintage and in a neighborhood that I'm sure holds lots of memories and not enough care. However, that lends to the experience. I'm proud to patronize this institution that has stood the test of time.The wait for my order was sort of long, however, I went at lunchtime and they had several call-ins and others who walked in. I rather enjoyed my visit as I created storylines in my head and checked out the handsome men as they prepared countless orders. The staff were listening to old gospel songs, which served as a backdrop to my imagination.But anyway....the food...I had the most moist delicious turkey superburger and a bountiful order of crispy battered onion rings. I thought about also ordering french fries, which are hand-cut and looked scrumptious...but I didn't want to be greedy. The burgers and other menu items are priced fairly low. There are canned sodas and water available for purchase.No one dined in during my visit, but there is a huge counter available to do so. Parking is on the neighborhood streets."}, {"review_id": "_g941DgBD-Wg5Ky6MKYR-w", "user_id": "AmvnT6fdo1V5PUGtdAdvdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This place has awesome burgers!!!!  The meat patties are huge.

Great burger. Fantastic service. On a roadtrip to Jackson MS. Decided to try the highest rated burger joints. This one was listed #1 and did bot disappoint. The 'single' cheeseburger is Massive!

Best place to go to back then next to bostons both were the go to spots around school. Big burgers and you will get full they don't play with the size. Which brings me to the rating. They took away the small burgers even though they weren't small at all they were enough for my gf since she can barely eat half of a super burger which is 12 oz I believe. I think the small was 8 oz. she would always get the STB with cheese and mushrooms /bacon/ grilled onions. It always came out 6-8 bucks or so. They've removed the small burgers from the menu and went up on the pricing for extra toppings which swayed my gf from going again. Still a good place to go to ! Definitely try it & CALL IT IN."}, {"review_id": "itakW2ZjOjN17_9Tk6ftzw", "user_id": "9oXT99Pa2HhhWdS8yoXOBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Glad I tried this place. Looks like they cook their food out of an old house that has been gutted to be a makeshift restaurant. Not a bad thing, I actually like it. It gives inspiration to any dreamer that wants to run a food business. Their burgers are good and big. They cook them slow and they season the meat themselves with what looked like salt and pepper. U gotta season the meat man. U got to. I ordered the super cheeseburger fully dressed and added bacon( even though it was not real bacon, or the kind of bacon I'm used to, turkey bacon maybe, I have no clue) and also a small order of lemon pepper fries. The burger and the fries were delicious. The only quarrel I have is that I waited about 45 mins for my burger. I did read somewhere that it's best to call it in to cut down in wait time but 45 mins was a little too long. Next time I will call ahead. And lastly the fries should have been tossed in the lemon pepper instead of pepper sprinkled on top because only the top fries tastes like lemon pepper. One the best burgers I have had in a long time."}, {"review_id": "fEl2swScfuUiuYMLVt_vow", "user_id": "UWgcD49FK9sUY5opH5rMlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Awesome service and food every time!!!!  If visiting Jackson and you want a great burger and fries its well worth the visit!!!"}, {"review_id": "cOMIk6QcusBJDctBLEzBFg", "user_id": "fXOw24apvquyrFjpp_zZwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2017", "text": "Easily, EASILY the best burger in Jackson, Mississippi. It is also in the top 3 burgers I've ever had. If you don't have a smartphone or just aren't a local familiar with the neighborhood you would never find the place. It's just a few blocks back from highway 80 and has a small parking lot. It almost blends in with the houses surrounding it. Established in 1970, Stamp Burger has been slinging hefty parties for quite some time. Seriously, the patties are gigantic. Probably close to a pound if not a full pound. I've seen a grown man cut this burger in half and barley finish the remaining portion. Nothing here is made until you order it. The beef is perfectly seasoned then plopped on a larger flat top grill. The sear is real .. bundled with fresh veggies and topping, this burger aims to please. While your beef sizzles, your fries are dropped in and fried. You can ask them to fry them a little longer if you prefer them crispy. They offer seasonings for fries like seasoned salt, lemon pepper and Cajun. If you're only feeding yourself, order a small. It's twice as big as you think it is. The fries come piping hot, piled high in a small basket. Be prepared for a nap after this meal. I get to eat it once a year and it's DELICIOUS every time. You certainly can't beat the price for the the flavor and portion you receive. Stop reading and go. Just go. It won't be the last time you go .."}, {"review_id": "UNzpgLQxw3-gELDw_EQjGw", "user_id": "pUAxgGg8RNA4EqRAaXnegA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/22/2016", "text": "The reviews look good, yesFood looks good....taste even BETTER.  Big, Juicy burger patties cooked fresh in front of you, don't be afraid to try this place. With the low price of the burgers, you might think it's low grade or super fatty, but that is not the case, they got the grill seasoned perfect for cooking their burgers. Double super burger with bacon & everything on it.This was the biggest burger I've ever eaten without making an absolute mess. The meat just tastes amazing. There was a little sausage/pepper taste I got on top of the seasoning/grill that was A+. When I go again though I'd get the burger with no mustard or ketchup, it took away from the great taste of the burger. So I'd stick with the greens, veggies & cheese.All the people working and around the building are nice, generous, and talkative. It's a great joint that's been around since circa 80's, had a chat with some of the guys there.BEST BURGER IN JACKSON..AND ALL OF MISSISSIPI? @J93THEWRITER = TWITTER & IG FOLLOW"}, {"review_id": "0Np_qRYh6a8nnbACM9dI4A", "user_id": "Wp5wZ6rZLNkw0MtZe4965Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/5/2017", "text": "I've been going to this establishment for years.

The place is close to the University and is settled within the surrounding community. The people are always in great spirits and though the wait time is very long- one should have patience for perfection. Believe me it is well worth the wait. Many times the locals will catch you in one of their conversations and it always makes the time go by a bit quicker. Just a warning: Don't bother adding this indulgence to your daily calorie count.
