I can't give this place a full review yet but this is what I know. I heard about this place from a friend. I heard it was cheap but really good. Like everything made homemade etc. so we thought we would go get some pizza from here for our New Years Eve dinner. So New Year's Eve day, we went here. He forgot to turn the sign on but they were open! Seems like they raised their prices on some things but still really cheap. 5.99 large pizza special? I believe with 1-2 toppings. Crazy!!We got the special that came with 2 medium pizzas, 3 toppings each and cheesy bread/breadsticks. And the total with tax came out to be 20.13? WHAT A STEAL. Why are they so cheap?!? This place is family owned and not a chain by the way. The guy was super generous and kind. Generous with the toppings oh em gee! Loadedddd. He also did not want me to tip him. He said no tip but I did so he threw in some ranches for us. So kind! Unfortunately I was sick so I wasn't able to really eat the pizza since I couldn't taste anything. But it sure did look delicious and made from scratch. The dough is super puffy"}, {"review_id": "ZjfVv2wskBc8qayaX341_Q", "user_id": "9N0eKiaaLAWk2tYLfKUyUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "Okay we all like Bella Pizza! As for business travelers and take out food sometimes we look for something quick convenient and satisfying. Bella has all of these things. Although they no longer deliver the owner volunteered to bring my dinner to my hotel by closing his doors. I declined the offer and went there instead. I met a fun and friendly owner who is a one man show 4 days a week and has a few worked on the weekends. He has pride in the fact that he makes many things from scratch. I orders a half Deluxe half Gyro and it was really good. I liked his light fluffy dough, much different from the New York style I'm use to back home. The loads the toppings on and flavors the crust. Nice touches. If you are staying in the area grab a pizza from Bella you will be glad you did."}, {"review_id": "Wou52wEUnGu4l5Mo3uLbHw", "user_id": "QX8DCQFR5aBgv-7pr2To0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "This is the best pizza I've eaten since I've moved to the Detroit area and possibly one of the best pizzas I've eaten in my entire life. This is the perfect neighborhood pizza shop. The toppings are piled high on their specialty pizzas. My new pizza joint!!! Not only is it ridiculously cheap for the super high quality ingredients in all of the food here. The chicken and steak are cooked fresh on the grill with all of the toppings and then placed on the pizza adding so much flavor on a very unique,delicious crust that is cooked to perfection. They sell large pepperoni pizzas for $6 and is probably the best deal in town.  I do recommend calling ahead as it does take a little extra time to prepare each pie but it's well worth the wait! The Owner is a nice hard working man that makes one hell of a pizza. You will not be disappointed in Bella. You will never want pizza from any other place ever again."}, {"review_id": "mIBWjMcsnMLeKZBzNwo-TA", "user_id": "1RjuwQl6HT7luowj8Q3Nfg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2017", "text": "Best pizza around. Sad that they open at 3, because lunch Bella would be amazing. I guess that's why they have leftovers. For the price of a large, you cannot go wrong.  I have shared Bella with numerous people and they have all agreed it's amazing. Don't listen to the lower reviews, they apparently don't have taste buds that work. If you taste this pizza and don't like it, you should see a doctor and see if you have an existing problem that needs to be taken care of.

Some sideways some square and some not cut at all.   The other pizza the half mushroom and half sausage.  The pizza wasnt even round it was the shape of a football.   You can see where they attempted to cut it. But it wasnt cut at all.   I know what a pizza is suppose to look like and this looked as tho a 5 year old made it.  For those of you that like mushroom.  You know what they look like when they are fresh and cooked and you also know what they look like when they are rotten.  These looked black and mushy disgusting.   Both pizzas were just horrible.   Then the breadsticks.   Thats what they called them.  This was just a ball of dough that was half cooked and half not cooked.   The whole experience was gross.   On top of that the person behind the counter (im guessing the owner ) was totally rude to other customers.   No wonder he stated that he was barely making any money.  Dont waste your time on this place.  Im sure they wont be in business much longer."}, {"review_id": "uDh_9bzVIJPs15_TeMnJRQ", "user_id": "IM3-RttDUxzf_gicI68zWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2017", "text": "Had a pizza craving in the house, yelp search, and see that Bella is the top rated in Warren. Just down the street. We have a menu from their grand opening who knows how long ago in the junk drawer, enjoyed it, but haven't been back since, no clue why.At first glance, the pizza looked too well done for my taste. However, the crust was so light and tender i'm not even mad, and the underside was perfectly done. I forgot to ask for butter garlic crust, but the sesame seed crust on the greek pizza is fantastic, wouldn't change a thing. Ranch is okay, nothing special, for my fellow ranch-heads.Also got a small meatball sub, which was awesome. The meatballs tasted like frozen store bought, edible but not great, but the sauce, melted cheese, and perfectly toasted bun were unbelievably good. All in all, for a medium greek pizza and small meatball sub, with plenty of leftovers, for less than 15 bucks, we were happy campers. Glad to meet you again, Bella, we'll be back!!"}, {"review_id": "OA78GdpHoSgrC_Uaxo47rQ", "user_id": "KQan1KE_r976Qvo14zhhxQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "8/6/2016", "text": "I was heartbroken to learn that Vincenzo's closed so I looked on Yelp for a replacement. I should've been more suspicious of the prices.I think it's so affordable - and tastes so school cafeteria-like - because they use some kind of processed vegetable oil cheese product instead of real cheese and because the pies are frozen and reheated. I could be wrong, I'm no expert, but that's what I suspect.I only got a one-topping so the poor quality of the pie wasn't disguised as much as on my husband's deluxe which was, like other reviewers', hidden under a mountain of toppings.
