We went to the one in OB and the vibe was amazing. The burger was almost as big as my face. It was a classic burger and everything from service to atmosphere was perfect. My husband got the guido burger and the moment he took a bite, his face melted with pure joy. That burger didn't stand a chance. If you're looking for the SD beach vibes go to the OB location. You won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "C_GhcjmATSEbPp1QDHEZqQ", "user_id": "i1YFtbts-p6HtdGh8gb5Iw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Good service. The ambiance and location were great too. Loved reading the license plates.  Loved the onion rings. My pastrami burger was ok. Next time I'll ask them to fry  the meat on the griddle. It's just off putting to eat a thick cut of meat that's rubbery. The chicken was no bueno it's legit not made w/real meat. Or if it is they're being robbed.  My hubs did like their blue cheese burger.

I like to eat and my favorite thing is the bacon cheeseburger. You will not be disappointed. I usually split the small size with a friend and we get fries on the side. SO good! The bacon is so crispy and the burger bun is perfection. You also get a bunch of stuff on your burger like lettuce, onion, tomato, ketchup, mustard and pickles. Of course you can ask for only the condiments you want. The french fries are your wedges with seasoning. They're yummy! Onion rings are also a good go to. You really can't go wrong if you're looking for a great burger. Only thing is that during peak hours you could be waiting a time to eat, but is it worth it? Yep! And once you get into the door and seated, you will be in and out fast!"}, {"review_id": "DmkSCKnACy3XEmNdmqq2gA", "user_id": "NmVOTj2jzsmozd1APHx87w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Hodad's is a staple of OB, and we finally made time to give it a try. There's prob going to be a line, but it moves quickly. This joint is pretty small; a bar in the back, some small tables, a long communal table, and a couple booths. That's it! I had the bacon cheese burger and fries. The burger was melty, gooey cheesy goodness and the bacon was crisp and added the perfect salt to the whole thing. The fries are really seasoned potato wedges, and I'm not mad about it. They were crisp and delicious. All in all, a solid burger joint. Service was fast, food was hot and tasted great.

It's an OB staple but has since grown in popularity! You can now find Hodad's at Petco Park. It is one of the main vendors through out the park serving up its classic hamburgers, thick cut wedge potato fries and chicken tenders. This may be going against the norm, but every time I go to Hodad's, I order the veggie burger. I'm not a huge red meat eater and prefer a veggie patty...when it's good. It is definitely good here! The patty is tasty. It isn't made with black beans. It is brown in color and mixed in with rice, veggies, etc.Something I don't like here are the fries. They are ginormous thick cut fries. I personally prefer thinner fries or even waffle cut. Just not, huge wedges. At least they are well seasoned, but they definitely aren't my go to style. The line can get SUPER long here. I'm not sure it's worth the wait. Hodad's is definitely delicious and tasty but I wouldn't go out of my way to wait for a long time for the burger. If you are craving Hodad's, I recommend going to the ballpark where it's super easily accessible."}, {"review_id": "dz_SCl5t3ziyR11v74jJfQ", "user_id": "FeGL0PAHNoAcQ9UP4_uKnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "My fiancé and I used to live downtown San Diego and we always wanted to go to Hodad's because it looked like a really cool place. We finally went but we went to the Ocean Beach location. What a great cool place!! There was a big line which was surprising because it was a Tuesday late afternoon but don't let that fool you, line goes by really fast. From the moment you walk in, you get to see and feel the great atmosphere. There's cool music, cool car plates and paintings on the wall. Staff members are not wearing uniforms and they are very laid back and friendly and helpful. We ordered the bacon cheeseburger and the double cheeseburger and it was a lot of food. Their potato fries are to die for! We also got one of their local beers.

I ordered the mini bacon hamburger with lettuce and tomato, and a side of onion rings. They came with a side of thousand island dressing which went great on both the burger and the onion rings. The burger itself was great. Don't let the word \"mini\" fool you, it was a normal sized burger. Their regular sized burger is actually just quite large. I also got to try the French fries, which are potato wedges, while I was there and I'd recommend going with the onion rings (much crispier and tastier).The restaurant definitely has a SoCal skater/surfer vibe to it, and most of the people eating there were probably in their teens or 20s. The waiter was very friendly and our food came out quite fast (like maybe 5 minutes). When it was time to leave though it was quite difficult to get our waiter's attention and we ended up having to ask another employee to do it, even though our waiter passed by our table repeatedly. Aside from that though, I had a good experience at Hoddad's and would go again."}, {"review_id": "oOkcYN-pYgux0L7y1b4zhw", "user_id": "KvEdzP2YUHf0Fb4-wMpaPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Good solid burgers! I had the Guido which is a decent twist on the all to familiar classic. This thing was loaded with grilled onions a few slices of pastrami and some deli mustard. It was good but the few bites I had of the regular cheese burger made me wish I would've ordered that instead. The onion rings are something their known for. They were good but mine weren't hot just room temperature so this made them kinda meh. However I could see the potential. The fries are more rough cut wedges and they are wonderful. All and all this place is a good stop if you're looking for a good burger and a decent local beer selection. The place is small and there is normally a line.  Don't let the line scare you just hop in the back and watch it move pretty quickly."}, {"review_id": "8xReoOybw0H6BPTvK0f4KQ", "user_id": "aDGmAxUXexwVXa0cqOca2A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "It's hard to go wrong with Hodad's Hamburgers in OB! The walls are plastered with stickers and license plates from all over the place. The surfer charm and grittiness of this place is apparent from the moment you get greeted and after walking what feels like a red carpet into hamburger heaven. The wafting of beach, sea breeze, and burger create a gnarly yet palpable aperitif to the nostrils as you prepare to what is about to be burger bliss. The burgers served here range in various sizes and you can double them up too. The prices are affordable, the quality is superb, and the mountain of very filling potato wedges they stack up for you make this a must try.

I'm not sure about that. We arrived just as the sun had set behind the other buildings, so we were lucky enough not to be getting sunburned while we waited. Street parking was pretty impossible to find, but that's understandable because you are litteraly less than a block from the beach. We ended up paying the  $5 to park in the small parking lot right next to Hodad's. I have to mention, there were so many cute dogs in this whole neighborhood, it was fun to see. After waiting outside we were ushered to a cute little table inside the front half of a VW Bus. The restaurant is not the biggest, but they do get as many people in as possible. The menu was simple and straightforward, mostly burgers and variations thereof, with grilled cheese and a chicken sandwich thrown in for good measure. I got the single cheeseburger with onion rings. The bun held up well against the juicy burger and toppings, but I had a hard time finding anything really special about the flavor of the burger. I would go back if I was in the area again, but I don't think I would go out of my way to make the trip again. I think people injoy it more for the beers and the beach atmosphere. The servers are fast, but they're so fast they are to the point of not smiling at customers and making them feel rushed."}, {"review_id": "-mOJGtYHHmf87w_uLjxV5Q", "user_id": "-NpUZ6ktuJPLXEkJy9KuqA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "After seeing Hodad's on Diners, Drive-ins, Dives I knew I had to visit.  As soon as my flight landed I was hungry and on my way.

Was sitting at my hotel bar and asked the staff where we needed to go for a decent burger. I did a little research myself and found this place was a location from Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The staff at my hotel without hesitation and without knowing my research, recommended this place.We set a course in our California family adventure towards Hodad's and upon walking into this very cool looking place, we knew we were at the right spot for a burger. In my mind, I was going to compare it to my favorites back home in Minnesota. Places that consistently win awards for their outstanding burgers. Places like, Mckinney Roe, Brunson's Pub, King's Place, Burgers and Bottles, Red Cow, and many others. And, in case you're wondering, never stop by Matt's Bar! Since it WAS on the show, I wanted to see if the foodie in me would agree with Guy. Does the dude really know what he's talking about? Or, do places just get on the show for whatever reason, but the food isn't even that good, but he can sell it? Well, as far as Hodad's goes, they're definitely doing things right. The  classic burgers their serving up is full of flavor and prepared perfectly. While I would still take some of my favorite places first, it's a solid burger creation and worth checking out if you'll be in the area visiting or a local that hasn't been yet. We also got a chocolate shake and that was easily one of the best shake's we've ever had and is a must order item. And, they serve jojo/tater wedges which I love and some awesome onion rings as well. The week we were in California, this was easily our favorite meal of the whole trip.#knowbeforeyougo"}, {"review_id": "nvhnN-GC-LF0Hc3OBnlT0A", "user_id": "hVHv9CUBdZVKMSO-oMVIXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "What a fun place.
