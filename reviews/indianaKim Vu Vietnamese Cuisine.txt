My daughter is home from college for the weekend and we wanted to eat somewhere that is not a chain restaurant with an international flavor.I found the listing for Kim Vu and thought a bowl of Pho would be perfect on a cold winters night.Read the other reviews when you finish mine. See if you can find the one about hunting wolves or watching The Nanny.Our party of four tried 2 varieties of Won Ton Soup, a noodle plate, and I got the Pho.For appetizers I tried the flat rice dumpling, the Vietnamese dumpling, an egg roll, and a spring roll.I grew up with Laotian neighbors and they made the best egg rolls that I measure any other against, and the Kim Vu contended well against my childhood memories of what a truly delicious egg roll should be.THE SPRING ROLLS ARE AMAZING!I am a big guy with a big appetite. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my Pho and everyone in our group took home a leftover box because we wanted to eat more but could not. I also bought a dozen egg rolls and a dozen spring rolls to take home because they are just so darn good!"}, {"review_id": "3ppABxEzs1jYpKrYVVQPRA", "user_id": "3QEOG7fTMZALhrirZ1WhPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "The owner is incredibly nice, the prices are so affordable, and the food is great.

First impression as I went in was underwhelming, but the happy greeting made up for that.  Chose a table and was immediately offered ice water (it was a very hot day so was thankful for that) and given the one page menu. They crammed quite a bit on there though, including some dishes I wasn't familiar with, which was exciting for me. I order ordered way too much, and was happy with everything. The (I assume) owner was very helpful, even explaining to my wife the correct way to eat the food she ordered.Reasonably priced and fantastic food.

This was my first time visiting this place and I will certainly be returning. Service was super friendly. All the customers seemed to be regulars which is a good sign. Cashier/waiter was very helpful and answered questions pleasantly.Ordered chicken pho and it rocked! Clear broth. Lots of noodles and veggies. Flavorful. Savory. Light yet deep flavors. With the addition of a touch of lime, splash of soy, a squeeze of siracha and a bite of my crunchy egg roll accompaniment, it was a perfectly balanced meal. Only thing lacking is the ambience... Then again, you can't eat Ambience so this place ROCKS !"}, {"review_id": "4g9I7hkvieUUlgo1Lj5rUw", "user_id": "xww3ZSDKNiJV9aX3lZwnfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Outstanding, Authentic Vietnamese food.

I was not familiar with Vietnamese cuisine before, and not only am I a fan, but the very friendly owner patiently schools you on your food as needed.Of course you need to try the pho. Love it. I've never tried hoisen sauce before, and now I'm a fan. The comedian Kyle Kinane had a bit about it (between the story about the nut on a plane eating dry silver dollar pancakes, and his own eating a large pizza as a taco (Whiskey Icarus)), and I was convinced.The bubble tea is fun. The typical Chinese sides like won ton and egg rolls are crisp and tasty. But the great sides are the spring roll in the clear wrap with the sliced shrimp inside and the peanut sauce; and the weird gummy-looking wrap with fish and pork on a banana leaf. I love buying that last one for first-timers as a dare. It really is yummy, but it challenges your standard of taste and texture, and I love it as an ice-breaker and as an entry into being open-minded about flavor. The other entrees are very good as well.My only disappointment is they don'r serve alcohol, and have limited seating, otherwise I would have groups there at least twice a month."}, {"review_id": "UF6oKSrSywcyReRk2wwo6Q", "user_id": "MGJeAQ5_gzwr_rhCf1b1gA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Excellent authentic food.  We lived overseas and this is the closest weve found to being back there.   Owner was very pleasant and accommodating.  Highly reccomended."}, {"review_id": "5nSAIeWnGWpdEGj5plUXFg", "user_id": "mk80cioEPDzIC78SPY-f4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Really good Pho on the North side of Fort Wayne.

Luckily, I caught the last table available. Coke products are only available by the can, so I opted to stick with the water that the owner promptly brought out. The owner is friendly & came out to the table to make menu suggestions. I wanted to try EVERYTHING! I settled for a crab rangoon (bigger than standard) shrimp spring roll with peanut sauce (a-freaking-mazing, even for someone who doesn't usually like the texture of the wrap) & egg roll (crispy & made to order). Each piece was brought out on it's own, so it was like a mini-extravaganza of appetizers. I ordered #8 & requested the pho veggies on the side. It came with another appetizer, a crispy shrimp cake thing, which was also good. There was an abundance of different meats in the noodle bowl & it had a great, light flavor (not as rich as their pho, which is also great). I had a lot to take home for dinner later & didn't save room for a smoothie. The place cleared out around 1:30pm, so I recommend going early or late for lunch. Warning: my coworker said I smelled like 'Chinese' food as soon as I walked in the office. The smell carried with me the rest of the day, but it was worth it!"}, {"review_id": "G4nDH_F5dt_yybffaLlJ_g", "user_id": "-o-a44sg6A-ymKt4YnK4cw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Tried all existing pho places in South Bend and Ft.

My wife and I were in Fort Wayne for the Air National Guard drill weekend and decided to look for a Pho joint for lunch.   We get on Yelp and saw the ratings for Kim Vu and decided to try it.  From the base/airport,  it was almost a half an hour away and when our gps told us we have arrived, it wasn't in an obvious location.   This restaurant was tucked in the corner of a strip mall, across the street from the main shopping mall (keep an eye out for the malls marquee with the restaurants name on it).The place was packed, but we didn't have to wait very long for a table.   We started with the Spring Rolls and we believe that it was one of the BEST we've ever sampled.  The shrimp in it were warm on top of the romaine and noodles.  Plus they used a slice of pork, unlike most places that use a pork loaf type filler.  The peanut sauce was excellent,  without being overly sweet.  My wife also ordered the Crab Rangoon and she said it was good, but a little too much cream cheese. For our lunch,  we both had the Chicken Pho (they only have beef broth ) and it was ginormous.  The soup came out hot, so the noodles cooked quickly.  The broth was harty and is very flavorful.  The chicken was all white meat, but was a tad on the dry side.All in all, Kim Vu was well worth the drive.  The next time we have drill in Fort Wayne, we'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "qcaKucPH1QeMUkhDq6fbFQ", "user_id": "K5vA58EvuN87CQbuRBCiaw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/16/2015", "text": "Finally tried Kim Vu last night after thinking about pho for a few weeks now. I have recently discovered my love for pho this year and was excited to try Kim Vu and see what the hype was all about! It is situated back off the road- behind the Dupont Casa. It is a hole in the wall so don't expect anything too fancy. There are a decent amount of tables and some decorations to make it cozy.First thing off the bat I noticed the service. When I approached the counter to order I was immediately asked if I was dining in- which I was- and directed towards a table. He came over with waters and menus. Discussed the menu with us since it was our first time and pointed out the pictures in the restaurant that show what the meals were. I was taken aback by his interactions with us because usually at hole in the wall joints you just order at the register sit down and wait. No service really. We started off with a spring roll and an egg roll. Both were delicious. I recommend the peanut sauce served with the spring roll. As we were finishing the rolls our beef phos arrived. Nice, huge bowl of smoking hot pho. Just what the doctor ordered. A generous plate of jalopenos, bean sprouts, and the cilantro relative I always forget. A lot of my beef was still red which kind of freaked me out- but the pho was sooooo hot it cooked it up right away. At least made me know it was freshly made. I have learned good pho is decided by the broth- this broth was pretty good, lacked a little character so I did add some sriracha half way through. The beef wasn't as tender as I like, but overall it did the trick. Nose was running, sinuses cleared, I left full and feeling brand new. I even had leftovers! 2 beef phos, spring roll, and egg roll for $20- not a bad date at all. What set Kim Vu apart was the awesome service. Wish I could remember his name! I will definitely ask next time!"}, {"review_id": "06cF9PBg-R99ZM6Wpe7OkQ", "user_id": "SzYPIChUlfgxLrrtTJ3sPw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/30/2017", "text": "I've been coming here for over 5 years now and it's one of my all time favorite restaurants!!
