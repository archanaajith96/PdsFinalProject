I have to admit, he really knows some great places and Jimenez is definitely one of them. This place is a hidden gem, right across from the Prudential Center. The owner greats you warmly and spends time talking to you over a cigar, while is mom is in the back handling the cigars. The Connecticut cigar is the best one out of the bunch and the Moscow mule is pretty amazing as well. There are multiple rooms and a cute outdoor patio. We plan on throwing a happy hour soon - and can't wait to go back."}, {"review_id": "u5P_DykU7lKtieOUHPiQnQ", "user_id": "PySf4XWYZ0Luyj58YVQ2-Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Top notch, quality place, run by true gentlemen who know their cigars and how to treat buyers.  I came off the street looking for \"barber poles\", which is what my grandfather used send me to buy, they are a cigar with a combo of light and dark wrappers.  I used to buy them from an older man near North Bergen high school, but sadly he has passed along with my grandfathers.The gentleman who greeted me knew exactly what I wanted, double wrapped torpedo box press.  I ordered a bunch to take, he packaged them up in 4 custom 5 per packs and tossed in some sticks, as well.I closed the deal with a hand shake, taking the two gratis cigars provided by the gentleman to smoke on the way home to awaken memories of those old boys.I didn't have time to explore the lounge, but it looked really old school and welcoming, I will be back to smoke and will bring a couple of bottles of my homemade vino to share with the purveyors of this fine establishment.Thanks Jimenez for doing it right!"}, {"review_id": "qZrph0U0aHs4RQ7P5abskQ", "user_id": "cIVmIJD7nIiEcVGamfBoVw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "I really enjoyed this place.  We came by for the Cuban sandwich truck that was parked outside after watching monster trucks crush some cars.  Sadly the sandwich truck was closed so we walked into what looked like a bar.  We were surprised to find this little cigar lounge.  It was a great experience, comfortable chairs everywhere and lots of space.They had some great music playing, I really appreciated Nina Simone being followed by Pink Floyd (it works so much better than you might think).  The staff was really friendly but also gave us our space.  They kept filling glasses of water and making my friend drinks (I was driving).  I wish I would have gotten a chance to try that Cuban sandwich."}, {"review_id": "yPZnZ4PuJ-5WuCKz3p5W2A", "user_id": "n5rmxz5qDWMzmjXFQZXn-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "Pros: Nice ambiance, lots of comfortable seating,  friendly staff & convenient location.Cons: they only sell the house brand which isn't terrible but definetly not the best and they're a little pricey.

I think its a nice spot for a low-key, get to know you kind of date or to just chill with friends. They serve specialty cocktails and the staff are really friendly and helpful. The decor is a dimly lit, sexy, speakeasy kind of vibe. Go after work or on a Friday or Saturday night. Good vibes for sure."}, {"review_id": "RDWWew1QcyfmRMyvq-iXtw", "user_id": "AbvkpfLG2hCMfJOp53javg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/28/2017", "text": "I can't say enough good things about this place! It has a vivacious atmosphere, exquisite hand rolled cigars, and a fantastic staff.

When I finally made it to the lounge, I was a bit taken away when I first approached the building but once I entered it was like you were in another world. With the jazz music in the background and the smells of the Jimenez cigars in the air and with their 1930's vibe I was as if I entering another time zone. We were welcomed right way by the staff. We had a section to ourselves and were accompanied by the owner of the establishment. His knowledge and his love for his cigars were educational to us. The mixologist made cocktails to our taste. This place was content and I extremely recommend all to check it out. Have a taste of their Cigar and order a Last Word, it will truly please your palate."}, {"review_id": "0Z6l3sqH39YVyE1N3QkVfg", "user_id": "gS6jlQY_4gVPXsOJfxuHuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/22/2017", "text": "Check it out for yourself and you won't be disappointed.

The great family behind this business, Peter and his mother Nelda, have turned this hidden Newark gem into paradise. This is the kind of place you walk in and literally 5 minutes later you know for a fact you will be a regular there. Everything about Jimenez is just PERFECT, the cigars are world class, Peter makes you feel at home and so do the waiters, bartenders and the entire staff. When they say \"hospitality is our forte\" they mean it, it's not salesman bullshit and they live up to their promise. My first time there was a few weeks ago, I stopped by for a quick cigar during my lunch break since I work down the block. Pete met me at the door, welcomed me in and even though he seemed to be going through some paper work, he took the time to go over the cigars with me and help me pick one. We sat down and had a nice chat. Pete is a true gentleman and very genuine person, he is the kind of guy that makes you feel you've known him for years. Pete's mother, Nelda, a master blender and wonderful lady welcomed me and made me a Cuban espresso herself... yea exactly, this family is amazing!!! Needless to say the cigar and coffee were nothing short of perfection. On the way out I picked up a number of cigars for a trip coming up, Pete didn't charge me for the cigar I smoked or the coffee.. unlike other business owners, these guys first priority is to provide their customer an exceptional experience. They take a lot of pride in what they do and they care about their name and their reputation and it certainly shows! The proof is in the pudding, the cigars, cocktails and service are exceptional.My next visit I went with my wife and she had a great time. Even though we went a little late, the food truck had closed but they were very accommodating and made us a really nice Cuban sandwich. The waitress, Paulina was in top of her stuff, she provided us with excellent service and did a great job recommending cigars and drinks. The other young gentleman Paul offered us complementary espressos more than once. When I asked him what cigar he was smoking, he immediately went inside and got me a Churchill Maduro, to date this is the best cigar I have ever smoked. A full bodied, rich stick with an amazing pleasant aroma. Even my wife loved it!Bottom line Jimenez is Newark's best hidden gem, if you are ever in the area, this should be #1 on your bucket list."}, {"review_id": "Qr6W8ukNjfbeoSHcpsLBCg", "user_id": "-_17SvrwhGOHeM1TfTDDNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/20/2016", "text": "If you don't mind the heavy cigar smoke that lingers on your clothes until wash day you will love this place! It is occupied with people from various ages, different genders and from all walks of life so there's plenty of diversity. The bartenders are skillfully equipped to making you whatever cocktail that lays under the sun! That's my definition of mixology! Great cocktails, an intimate fire place, a tv to watch a good game or fight and an endless selection of cigars. They even have a back porch that is designed and lit beautifully during the warmer seasons. The only downside is that they do not serve food. The upside to that is that you can order from any place that delivers to the lounge."}, {"review_id": "HBJRXQadcqbT2fOGvRYQjQ", "user_id": "zfThgGaLLPVHscJ_rlmYsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/25/2017", "text": "I don't even know where to start.
