Im okay with admitting it. I have my favorite shop in Philly and it is a standard that I hold the rest of the cheesesteaks to. So, there's that.Now, when my boss was looking for someplace to do some catering for an event that she has coming up she did a quick search and found Jackie M's and asked if I minded trying out their food-scoping them out. And because I love any opportunity to find a cheesesteak in this area, I said \"yes\".Guys, the location is small, it is located in a small house BUT the size of the location doesn't stop the flavor of the food. It is good! I felt like doing a little dance. Let's be real, when I got back to the office I probably did do a dance.Their meat is not deli meat and it is all fresh cooked there. They cut and season their fries. AND, they know and make water ice! For a hot second I was transported back to Philly and it felt good.The atmosphere is one that had me singing about \"a place where everyone knows your name\" in my head. I can imagine that it wouldn't take much to be a regular."}, {"review_id": "bnv6dzmxxP3HEU6klNmhlg", "user_id": "DRD1wGc1BaVKnnFA3T-MWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "So Jackie M's & Son has been popping up on my app every time I searched for lunch options in the area but I kept passing it up. Well my hubby suggested that we go and I'm so glad that he did!This is a family run business which is great! The staff was so friendly and helpful!The food is absolutely amazing! Everything was prepared fresh and came to the table hot. We ordered the soul rolls with jerk chicken...they were so good! I was good after eating them; they were pretty much a meal themselves. Definitely a must try if you go!I ordered the hot smoked turkey and my husband had the hot smoked jerk turkey. We so full we only ate half of our sandwiches. And we had to save a little room for dessert.We ordered the red velvet cheesecake! It's one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had.

We had 2 giant sub cheesesteaks with handcut fries. Ordered Soul Rolls jerky chicken. Cheesesteaks were based on how much steaks do you want on sub, not size of the subs as I imagined.  totally friendly staffs all around. This is not typical franchise cheesesteaks with minimal steaks on sub for cheap price. You do receive what you pay for. Food was amazingly best and staffs were super accommodating. I was skeptical at first from the looks of the place. We were highly satisfied!!"}, {"review_id": "91SCiBd43YBd_9sNLhZ0Nw", "user_id": "1z1fdG99DTPEwnwXgJPDhw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Loved it !! Went for lunch to try the Philly.

Best home style meal we've had on our long adventure! We loved this place! They make you feel like family, so nice! We both had the Philly Cheese Steak with grilled sautéed onions, mushrooms and cheese on a hoagie roll that was so fresh and soft! We also had Chicken Soul rolls (so good!) and chose their yummy Blue Cheese dressing for our dipping sauce. Their hand cut fries are crispy and delicious.Wow, everything is just so flavorful! We also had to get their Classic Cheesecake with Strawberry Topping to go for dessert later (we were stuffed!) and it was so good! Wish we had a place like this near home, we'd go there a lot and try everything on the menu!When you find a place that is so good to their customers and you can tell they put a lot of love along with expertise in their cooking it really makes a huge difference in the whole experience of dining out.

A hidden gem. If you haven't checked this place out and you live here, I really don't know what you've been eating. I say this place is the first place that has gotten a 5 star in Augusta. Why? Because of the whole experience I had on one of my last meals before leaving to head back to Knoxville. Let me talk about my experience. I can see how this restaurant/catering has been in business for 16 years. You can tell the first time you walk through the door. They truly stand by their words that if you eat there, you are family. I ordered the Philly Steak Kitchen Sink which basically comes with everything. The sandwich had a hint of spiciness, which was welcomed. The cheese was amazing because what I liked about it was that it wasn't cheese wiz. While my sandwich was being cooked I walked around the place and well, I found out from reading one of the many articles on the wall the son went to Johnson and Wales! The atmosphere is something that just couldn't be replicated. I didn't expect a low quality sandwich when I walked around their interior because they cared about their home feel restaurant.  I know that the cheese steak looks a tad bit messy, but that's how it's supposed to look because the taste is out of this world.I would truly recommend on coming here to get a cheesesteak and talk to them a little bit because they are more than welcoming and social."}, {"review_id": "Yij74jy0s2UIDR1doaPjxQ", "user_id": "t6APoWYiHxciyjU2fedo8Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/16/2017", "text": "Wow!
