I finally tried this place. I have to say; the teriyaki rice bowl was SOOOO good. The rice itself was heaven sent and then chicken was pretty good!! The price is super cheap for what you get! I wasn't a fan of the bigger box, mostly fatty pieces and the short rib was really burnt but overall not bad!!"}, {"review_id": "kXst21TGvjGrXdNXUQsozA", "user_id": "M4aWuvARUiqY9AEVHZgmzw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "We stopped at L & L Hawaiian Barbecue and for being a Thursday night, this place was packed! I'd recommend getting in early if you want some Poke.   I wanted some Poke and we were late enough that there was no Poke to be found.  I seem to be constantly missing out on Poke.My family ended up getting some of the Chicken Katsu and some of the pork.  The Katsu is the only thing that keeps this restaurant from getting five stars.   The chicken for the most part was good, the breading, amazing.  The problem is when the chicken was not good.  There were several parts that were just gristle.  It was very disconcerting when I'd bite down on a piece of breaded chicken and get gristle.  As for the pork, it was, amazing.  I also have to say, my wife and I loved the macaroni salad.  It's just that good!We decided we would try L & L again when we had a chance to see if we just were there at the wrong time."}, {"review_id": "r2OYZQta5pF0Jww6dgoS5w", "user_id": "11Qrh90iAUHG2ahdtoe2pg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "L&L is amazing and I'm sad that this is the only location in the Denver metro area. I always stop here when I'm in this part of town because their food is simply delicious. I've been to Hawaii before and have visited the L&L there, but if I had to choose, I will say the Aurora, CO is way better than the ones in Hawaii and that's saying a lot since it's native of Hawaii. All the meats here are really good. I love the chicken katsu curry, the curry sauce makes the dish. Regular size dishes come with two scoops of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. You can substitute mac salad for rice and vice versa. The spam musabi is always good and made to order. Haven't tried the chicken version yet but I'm sure they are as equally as delicious. They also have different canned Hawaiian drinks for purchase that are pretty yum. Note, this place is always always consistently packed no matter what day or time you come in. The restaurant also has limited seating so if you're not in a rush or maybe in a rush, it is best to make a to go order for pick up."}, {"review_id": "LP4KLCbokkwf9X7E6k3R7Q", "user_id": "Dwm7wP_FpFsjrLdNZSBmsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "It's got the name going for them...but not quite the same as the ones on the island (Hawaii) and California.

Before I even walked into the restaurant, I could smell the chicken katsu, which made me even more hungry. I walked in and wasn't at all surprised by the long line and hungry folks ahead of me. The wait is worth it. I ordered the Hawaiian BBQ chicken with rice, Mac salad, and a spam masubi. The chicken was moist, and the sauce wasn't over powering. The rice and Mac salad complemented the food very well. The spam masubi was an extra $2 and was an excellent appetizer. My friends got the chicken katsu, which I found to be really crispy and full of flavor. You must get the plum sauce because the chicken is slightly dry. But overall the meal was a huge success. If you're in the Aurora area, come check out L&L.

Being a Pacific Islander, it's familiar and the flavors you are looking for, however there are some clear downfalls. 1. The space is small and looks unclean. They could really benefit from a complete scrub down, remodel or move to a larger space. They are too small for the volume of business and the layout could be better to dine in. 2. The staff, they seem understaffed and overwhelmed consistently. This leads to food inconsistencies and long waits. 3. Ordering to dine in is easy when there is a spot to sit. However ordering to go is awful. I have ordered to go a few times by phone and they never have the food ready at your estimated time. I've even shown up later to see if that would help and nope, you will always wait an average of 10-15minutes extra once you arrive, then wait in line to pay. I have called asking for an order to be prepared at a later time, only to be told no that they could do a time with in 15mins of my call. I agreed, arrived and had to wait 30mins. By the time I got my food it was at the time I originally had wanted but did I want to wait on my lunch break past my estimated time, no. They could really use an online ordering system and call waiting. Efficiency is the issue, I'd love to see them evolve and grow to a better business and hopefully they will."}, {"review_id": "pttChu5m0lXKJAuZ6WzjSA", "user_id": "LP0zMIAx3oM4Borq9UUsVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Rock solid joint for seriously good food.

Denver is going through some weird phase of loving Hawaiian food - which I'm not upset about but few places do it right. L&L is one of those that does it right! The only downside is that it's so far away from DT Denver! Whenever we drive to the airport L&L is a must stop. Their Mac salad reminds me of the ones I ate in Hawaii. My husband loves their lava chicken and I'm obsessed with their katsu. The portion sizes have changed over the years but with the price I'm a-okay with that!

Good thing for a small business, but there really isn't room to stand so it's definitely awkward when your butt-to-face with someone who's trying to eat their lunch. The service staff at the counter was a mixed bag. The girl that was helping us seemed pretty stressed and was a little curt, but the expeditor was very pleasant and smiling.This place could really use an expansion. I have never gone when there wasn't a line, and finding a place to sit is more like a lottery. (This was my second visit, but I drive by a lot as I do a bit of shopping in the adjacent strip malls). They seem to have the business to support a larger space, I hope they do that in the near future.My complaints about the size limitations aside, the food is very good. I was a little bit nervous too try various different things, so I went with fried shrimp which was really yummy. I like the rice but I love the macaroni!The driver behind the four stars is definitely the food. The menu is confusing. I wish there was some sort of sample platter that was obvious and featured so a newbie such as myself could try all the offerings. As busy as they are, you hate to be the guy asking a thousand questions at the register!If you're feeling adventurous and in the neighborhood, I would definitely recommend trying out this little gem.

Not my favorite way to eat, personally. It had been ages since trying L&L in California, and this location's quality of food lived up to the experience I'd had out there as well.The macaroni salad had too much mayo. The kim chi wasn't spicy enough. Steamed veggies were totally unseasoned and bland. I got an entree salad with chicken, and that was okay but not great. Iceberg lettuce, not real lettuce, so it was pretty flavorless.Meh.
