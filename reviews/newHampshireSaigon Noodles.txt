Although the restaurant is not right downtown, it is so worth going. The owner is wonderful and she cooks everything herself. You can tell that the broth is made from scratch.

The owner is a one woman show who has the role of hostess, cook, and a waitress.  That was pretty impressive. Got to respect her hard work.  Thankfully we were the only ones in the entire restaurant the service was pretty fast. The vegetable summer rolls and pho were really good. Best I've had, ever"}, {"review_id": "n-DFlEuW5wx7yTGidV-TAw", "user_id": "Y-WRIBlY9kwcpUGysUa2UQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "Excellent pho, delicious spring rolls, and fantastic peanut sauce; what more can you ask for?

The tea was delicious, as were the spring rolls and Pho. Unfortunately there was a lady that didn't understand how Vietnamese food is prepared and made a scene about her food not being \"fresh\".

Originally we wanted to see if Manchester was going to be a place we would want to live, taking into consideration if there were going to be convenient cultural restaurants and grocery stores nearby for us if we were going to move here. Hence, during out search we googled and found Saigon Noodles. The reviews for this place was great so I thought why not give it a try.....worst mistake. 1. The place was hard to find unless you were very observative because the banner that had the restaurant's name was faded and hard to read. 2. There weren't clear instructions on where to park so you kind of have to go in and ask them if it's okay to park in the front, across the street in the plaza's parking lot, or where else. 3. The place was extremely dark. Very very very dark. It was well 12pm -1 when we came in and so guaranteef there was alot of sunlight outside but sadly, none that shine through the windows of this place. The owner was being very conservative with the electricity and didn't turn on any of the lights. She probably turned on just one bulb for us that shine atop our table. My husband had wanted to back out and leave but it was too late, I had already sat down. It'll be more awkward and rude if I stood up and left. 4. She creeped me out by having kept on running her fingers up and down my back and complimenting me on how \"cute\" i looked? Thanks?? But....can you not touch me??! 5. My husband saw that it was quiet and she seemed to be the only worker and so he tried to start a small conversatiom with her so that it's not awkward but she gave him very dry, cold, and short responses, making what was meant to be comfortable and opening conversations, turned out to be even worse than awkward. 6. We ordered two Pho Tai Bo Vien and there weren't even a handfull of noodles in the bowl. There were exactly 3 half-inch slices of beef ( half-in width!!!) and 2 bo vien (meatballs) that clearly was ONE because she just cut it in half and called it two peices. My husband finished his bowl in less than 3 scoops. I barely made it to the 4th scoop. The veggies she brought out for the pho wasn't even enough for two people. With people who eat Pho and knows the meal, it should come very proportional to the size of the bowl you ordered. She didn't even bring enough veggies for one person let alone two. Oh , and side-note:: there's only two sizes, medium and large bowls. We ordered mediums and it came out looking like a kids' size order in a large bowl. That's it. Rip offfff 7. Finally..........the atmosphere is entirely dingy and uncomfortable. Especially the darkness of the entire place. If you are a tourist or someone out of state trying to find a good place to eat, please do not come here. Unless you really honest to all; have to."}, {"review_id": "6_m9HCReBw3WRQCULEErzg", "user_id": "lgRg0XQ8cdDgNvJ7aTXBCw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/3/2017", "text": "I loved Candy's fried rice, and was going there just for that, but recently found out that she dropped it from the menu since not many people ordered it.  Booooo. :(  Not a great move.  Her fried spring rolls are okay, but a little pricey for what you get (2).  Although I haven't had the pho, a friend who had it one time said it was really good.The first time I went there, I wasn't sure if I was going into the right building because of poor signage, and the entrance being in the back.  It's dimly lit inside and looks like it used to be an old function hall.  The bar is huge and takes up most of the space.  Candy is nice, but I wish she kept her menu the same, had faster service, and worked on the interior a little bit more.  She could probably do well with a smaller place."}, {"review_id": "iEDQrX5Cbo6InC4jGSdCLQ", "user_id": "79IlFAULM6_xik89RdwDvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "We stopped here on our way back from skiing and filled our bellies with delicious pho.

I wore my hair down and it was getting in my soup and the sweet little lady in the kitchen came and pulled my hair back with a rubber band. They were so hospitable, kind and are amazing cooks.

It was a very cold evening out, and when I walked in, the restaurant also felt very cold. I was greeted by Candy. I remarked at how cold the restaurant was - she immediately adjusted the thermostat and warmed the place up.I ordered the Spring rolls and Pho Ga (large). I always eat my rolls and Pho with a lot of Sriracha sauce. Candy saw this and diced up some hot chilies and threw them into my bowl of Pho to spice things up.The rolls were very good and were very fresh. The Pho was interesting - she adds ingredients into her Pho that you don't see in Pho joints in the Washington, DC area (such as carrots, broccoli, and some sort of asian radish). Overall the broth was tasty, it was steaming away when she brought it out. The one thing I will ding her on - she told me she gave me extra noodles. It was to much. I could not eat them all - and so wasted some food. I could have used some more of the chicken broth - it was very tasty!I was the only customer in the place for a little while, so Candy came over and sat down at my table with me to talk to me while I sampled the Pho. It was at that point I introduced myself and asked her - her name. She said \"Candy\" and also handed me a business card.At this point some other diners arrived, so she sprung into action to take care of her customers.A nice little Vietnamese/Pho place! Check them out!

Ordered the egg rolls and chicken pho for a late lunch. First off, the restaurant is abnormally dark with interesting mood-lighting fixtures.The egg rolls I ordered came out burnt on one side. I'm not talking about lightly charred. It was straight up burnt. I was starving so I strategically bit into the un-burnt sides. It was mediocre in taste.Chicken pho was basic, lackluster when it came to flavor. The medium pho portion size might as well been a small. All in all, disappointed. This may have been great Pho per NH standards based on the reviews. Nothing compared to some of the Pho places I've frequented in Los Angeles.
