On the day that I was there the seating area for the food (a bar and a a few tables) was pretty crowded.  In the food prep area were two well dressed and friendly guys that seemed to be working pretty hard making everyone's food.For my snack on this day I decided to go with a falafel sandwich as well as a hummus with pita.  It was ready after only a short wait and I paid at the counter and headed out of the store.  Whenever I was able to finally dig into my sandwich I was pretty impressed.  The falafel itself had a nice seasoning to it and I enjoyed it paired with the lettuce tomato and dressing that was also inside the wrap.  As for the wrap itself, it was tight and nothing was coming out of it which I appreciated.  After finishing the sandwich I was able to try the hummus and pita.  While the hummus had a nice tahini flavor to it I found it to be a little on the bland side.  I did enjoy the pita though which had the perfect firmness to it.  It gave a you a nice bite to it without being overly chewy.The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  As a matter of a fact I plan on bringing a coworker with me the next time we both visit Hartford."}, {"review_id": "3N3dzkSMQi78quH8H0Ts0A", "user_id": "pOw7c8vcsBA2YeE1UFU7eA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "My favorite place to eat in the entire world, and without a doubt the best meal in Connecticut.As a junior in high school, a close friend dragged me and several others to a small international foods market for falafel sandwiches and \"the best baklava ever.\" And so began ten years of patronage to Tangiers, an international foods market and lunch counter run by what seems to be a family of handsome Lebanese gentlemen. Always impeccably dressed, these guys are genuinely kind, friendly, and welcoming to anyone who comes through their front door. And, even though they recently moved to a larger location (although the well-loved and endearingly dirty falafel/frying pot remains), they make some of the most consistent and amazing Middle Eastern food that I have ever eaten.Everything on the menu is fresh, authentic, and delicious. Gyros and falafel are the highlights, and hummus, baba ghanoush, and grape leaves turn any meal into a feast. Turkish coffee is strong. While I haven't shopped much in the grocery portion of the store, there seems to be a variety of specialty and ethnic foods that can make folks from far away feel like they're at home. Don't miss the baklava on your way out, and \"come back soon, my friend!\""}, {"review_id": "gUfvsc2zlNluRCbYX16DJQ", "user_id": "XI6L_vgfuAcZoHyyoQxOZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Honesty, I was looking for a restaurant in the area. It was between Tisane and Tangiers. Went to Tisanes, but the lot was full, drove across the street to find parking, and lo and behold I was at Tangiers! Tangiers is a middle eastern market with a food counter and a few tables in the corner. The place was immaculate, very shiney, very clean. We ordered a chicken gyro and a couple of small plates. The food was wonderful, fresh, tasty, and clearly prepared by middle eastern men - we were watching them!The owners (brothers) were courteous, friendly, and helpful even though we were there during lunch rush.  Loads of folks doing take out.So happy Tisane's lot was full! Tangiers is wonderful!"}, {"review_id": "wRsvvI1FjTlxsom1Rs3xSg", "user_id": "ySfth0a2qvwPbqXHw0yrFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "How have I not written a review of Tangiers yet? This place is the best, whether you're looking for a ready-made meal or the ingredients to do it yourself. Start here if your recipe calls for anything Mediterranean or Middle Eastern -- and count on spending a loooong time browsing their shelves. Just as impressive as their food? Their service -- very warm, friendly and helpful.

This is the best Mediterranean restaurant I have been to. They are always very courteous. When you put the order those handsome guys prepare it right in front of you. I like the lamb gyro and the beef gyro the most. There falafal is also really good. I always ask them to make my gyro spicy. They have the best baklava I have tasted. I never come out of there without having one. Another great thing about this place is there is no tip concept here. There are plenty of parking spots. There is a lot of food from Turkey and other middle eastern countries in the store. I have tried many of them. Pistachio tahini helva is the one which I like the most. It tasted very different from anything I tasted. And the first time I tasted it I was not sure whether I liked it. But then I got hooked."}, {"review_id": "L5w1GmDdjPFu9N5YMPIuSQ", "user_id": "_yrWWc93xAK1f-WZ2Bvo9w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/10/2017", "text": "Walking in the front door, I thought I was in the wrong spot because I was greeted by what appeared to be a health foods market. I was greeted warmly by one of the employees as I looked around. However, against one wall was a grill and a counter. The menu next to the counter doesn't display prices but it does proclaim the mixed middle eastern type food that is offered. At the counter I was again greeted with the smile. I got the feeling that the people who work here are not only friendly but also calm. It put me at ease and made me feel welcome. For food, I decided to try the falafel plate. It is essentially a wrap but the pita is replaced with more vegetable. It came with a side of hummus. For me, good hummus is a tell-tale sign of good food and here was no exception. The hummus was smooth and rich in flavor. The falafel was also excellent. I will be back here to try more of the offerings and to shop around for other food needs."}, {"review_id": "cFX6-M4VybKW1ZhcFuIoIw", "user_id": "uqd0G-uoYzwYAuquCjfE7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2017", "text": "How have I not reviewed this yet?

I'm so glad I finally made it it here last Friday for lunch.  When you walk in you are greeted by a nice open , clean market of international delight. There is something for everyone, from dried goods , prepared foods and baked goods . I ended up bringing home some store made hummus, fresh made pita chips and some tabouli salad . We enjoyed those items later for a little happy hour at home with the Misses.Now on the the freshly made food. In the back section is their counter and cook area . I was greeted by one of the owners who welcomed me and shook my hand after I told him it was my first time here.  I did happen to be with one of his well know regulars , but it was definitely a nice touch. So welcoming. We both ordered the Falafal and grabbed a drink and headed outside . The owner said go sit outside and relax I will bring it out to you. Another nice touch on this beautiful day. These brothers and other family members know how to run a business. The Falafel was delivered and oh my God so delicious, the combination of ingredients including the tahini sauce , so fresh tasting. Their whole menu looks so delicious, I will definitely be back to try more things . It will be so hard not to order the falafel , so I may bring the other half so we can share and try other things . Their lamb is next."}, {"review_id": "QOpb-QYt2pHKZJr2yHxoMw", "user_id": "7t6udi4sK1tRpgcbmVXaPQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2017", "text": "A grocery store with a small cooking section in the back where you can order food.

This is my safe space I run to, esp on Mondays, when most chefs are off or restaurants are closed. Twice this month, I've had food poisoning and saw some horrendously dirty kitchens at nearby establishments (I used to inspect kitchens so it's a compulsion for me to count violations). Not only do they practice extreme hygiene, the food is amazing and delicious. The co-owners/brothers are hospitable, friendly, and have a great sense of when you feel like chatting or if you just feel like being left alone. I've had pretty much everything on their menu except the chicken gyro. They are conscientious of food allergies (nuts, gluten, eggs, dairy, and vegan needs so far) and they go out of their way to make sure you and your guests are happy and well fed. I've lost count how many friends/family entered w severe food aversions and ended up enjoying and even craving their foods (smoked eggplant dip, gyro, kebabs, and falafel will convert anyone). It sounds like I'm describing some upscale, exclusive club but their menu items are filling,  delectable, and very affordable. I also enjoy the market side. Back in the mid-90s, they were the only place outside of Boston where I could find quality sumac, olive oils, and Turkish products I love. So what are you waiting for? Get yourself over there NOW, you won't regret it!"}, {"review_id": "Szwo_u_pXsgcDf-LwsNdQA", "user_id": "3eIZJH-qa9Bz-l3i2xPLgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/25/2017", "text": "I have known tangiers for four years now.

The felafel wrap is simply awesome, good size and they can be customized to your level of spicy.I have tried their chicken wrap too, nice tender pieces and good size too.

(when I can).A few things, the falafel is great, the wrap is great, everything, I would like a bit more sauce.  I know, if I'm there I could ask for more.  And I'm not a big fan of tomatoes..  Again, I didn't buy it, so, can't complain about free food right?
