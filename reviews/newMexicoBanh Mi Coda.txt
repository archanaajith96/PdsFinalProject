They make their own pastries a twist from french influence which are delicious.I got the #10 the beef wrapped in grape leaves garnished with cilantro, pickled radishes and shredded carrots. Was sooo good!And I had a homemade \"raisin bread\" Vietnamese style \"banh nho croissant\" . Not too sweet, with a hint of rum. Just right.Note that they have expanded their space so there is plenty of seating area for lunch now. All remodeled!

I probably go here at least 4-5 times a month, easy. They recently expanded their space a little too, so there is more seating room. It was tight before! I love getting the marinated grilled pork sandwich and the spring rolls. My go to is shrimp and pork spring roll, but the crunchy spring rolls are really good as well (they have this crunchy thing down the middle and it adds to the soft/crunchy texture aspect). If you are looking for a lighter lunch, spring rolls are a great option. The sandwiches are very filling, but easy to save for later if needed! They also offer many other options, noodle bowls, tofu, sticky rice with meat, and baked items. The bread is of course made in house (it is a bakery) and it is awesome. They have great service and get your food out fairly fast. It is always a go to when we are craving Vietnamese food."}, {"review_id": "Ihr0P8K2pYyp_gEqVoDLLQ", "user_id": "s7DOGaUBVoyVgwdmCQWiVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Not that I'm a Banh mi expert, but I know what I like!

I can find myself here sometimes twice a week for lunch. I'm obsessed with their #4 Pork Meatball and #6 Grilled Pork sandwiches. The bread is just the right texture, both soft and crunchy and not too doughy. The proportion of filling to bread is perfect, which is kind of a big deal to me. I can't stand when the bread is all there is. Their sandwiches are just plain delicious. I will have them as is or drizzle some rooster sauce (siracha sauce) on a bite here and there for some added spice. I will also switch it up and get an order of spring rolls. #25 Shrimp and Pork sausage or the #28 Grilled Pork. They're my favorite because they have a crunchy piece of egg roll wrapper in the middle. Sometimes I order a couple pieces of their homemade onion tofu and a pork meatball pastry. Their green chile chicken pastry is also pretty tasty too. They have several different items that they switch out from time to time on the shelves when you come in. They have a dish with sticky rice and chicken doused in a teriyaki sauce served with some crunchy onion garnish. You will also find a few desserts as well. Needless to say they have a lot to offer and it's pretty safe to say you won't be disappointed by any of it. I always like to a get a Vietnamese iced coffee to quench my thirst. It always helps me get through the rest of my day as well. It gets busy for lunch so call in your order and pick it up as soon as you get in. Or stay and enjoy your meal fresh and sit and people watch, they expanded their dining room so there is plenty more room. But wait, did I tell you to get the sesame ball? It's sooooo good!"}, {"review_id": "qi0kMWuZxnl0jgRNvlB8wQ", "user_id": "RsIBwaU0srby1ANQAjFjqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "The food here is amazing. The tofu is made to perfection. All of the ingredients are fresh too. I feel like I've been missing out on life with the introduction of Vietnamese food.

Luckily we stumbled upon this place and it was such a great find! All of the foods here are authentic Vietnamese items. The food is really good but a little pricier than I'm use top paying. But i guess that's how it'll be when there isn't a large Asian community food district around. I'm still glad to find such yummy food here. It makes me feel sane again finding Asian food in New Mexico. There are also a lot of awesome Asian markets and restaurants around this area that runs along the International district. It's also next to an airport and close by lots of shopping centers. The location is great, especially when being a tourist in Albuquerque! The Banh mi is authentic and tastes just like home. A little on the pricer side, but still worth it when you haven't ate viet food in a while. Everything here tastes really amazing and they cook it fresh, you can taste the soft and chewiness in the Banh It Tran balls and how smooth the Banh cuon tasted.They have lots of other items displayed nicely along the counter. It's a new and modern looking store. I will be back when I visit again!"}, {"review_id": "qtjhIEa8uetZ8t9vYtdDbg", "user_id": "QAadRE2XcrUtfw5B_K85cw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Awesome little deli/ bakery with good food, drinks, and atmosphere.

The sandwiches are made on the right kind of bread - which isn't to be taken for granted. The fresh veggies and the meats are spot on. There is a larger selection of sandwiches here than a most bahn mi places.But - that is not all - spring and summer rolls of all descriptions are made to order. There are sweet and savory grab-and-go selections. I love the bahn cuon (thin steamed rice pancakes filled with tiny bits of ground pork and tree ear mushrooms that are rolled up). When you take your bahn cuon to the cashier - they stuff the plastic shell with lettuce, cilantro, sliced vietnamese sausage, and steamed bean sprouts. You also get a little container of fried crispy onions. My favorite dish!And they make their own puff pastry and pate - you can get a very French \"turnover\" of puff pastry filled with pate or meatball.House made tofu is awesome. You owe it to yourself to come here. Service is friendly.

The thai ice tea was a little on the sweet side for me and I love SUGAR! The fast service can always can take care of the long line in a timely matter. That is why I don't mind waiting in long line.

The veggies were fresh and crunchy, the pork was delicious, and...well, it's everything you want in a banh mi. No tough, bland pork here. I also tried a sesame ball which was also just as delicious and unique. Very subtely sweet, nice and crunchy...super messy. Woohoo!Reasonably priced and they had a ton of other stuff that looked amazing. I heard that they have something called coconut waffles (not on the menu) that I didn't have an opportunity to try but maybe next time. Just go!
