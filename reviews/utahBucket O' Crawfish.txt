It's a unique, one of a kind seafood eating experience because salt lake does not really have any other Cajun seafood restaurant (at least that I'm aware of) and for it being the only one it is so darn good. I believe what makes this place so special is the quality of their seafood and how fresh it tastes. Sure there's an overcooked shrimp here and there but overall it's cooked to perfection. I love, love loveeeee their sauce crazy mixed w/medium spice. Be aware there is times when even their medium is a little too hot when you're deciding on a spice level. Their Cajun fries are really good, fried chicken wings are even better with their unique sauce. Must try! I would recommend avoid coming in at dinner rush with bigger parties because they are busy. Perhaps try getting in a little bit before six. The servers are kind, I've never had a bad experience. The manager Cindy is kind and wants to make sure everyone has a good dining experience."}, {"review_id": "is1yPYTaEfbeSxljkbHzug", "user_id": "8-LRG-q4-VdCMe7lPSKOEA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "There's a place in Los Angeles called The Boiling Crab that gets two hour lines is worth every minute of waiting.

I've never had snow crabs where I try to crack it open, and it's soft.  This time we ordered something new, the cajun wings and the batter was light and crispy, served with the jalapeño sauce. so addictive! I believe it's the same batter they use for their calamari as well (also good). If I have to say something negative, it'd have been their fries, not as hot and crispy as I'd like.

Bucket also had fried seafood options and local beers.I had shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes in the crazy mix, medium spice. Shrimp were in the shell with heads, my preference with this kind of set up. Seasoning was ok, not as flavorful or spicy as I wanted. Portion was small, and the side portions were extremely chintzy for the cost.I'd hoped to do crawfish but Bucket was charging $12.95/lb.  No way in hell I'm spending that much on crawfish.  And after tasting their seasoning, I'm glad I went with the less expensive shrimp.Interior is large and well designed and decorated. Our waitress was nice enough but couldn't help us decide on our meals as she'd never eaten the food (wha?)."}, {"review_id": "CBuNFVABYxzTYLcAqtl-lw", "user_id": "J6Pw68sXrchiWGpLc0dGag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "I always love coming here!

Started with the Clam Chowder. A deal for $3.50 with a subtle smokiness and strong Clam to Chowder ratio. Grabbed a pound of shrimp with potatoes and gator sausage. Shrimp was overcooked and a little small for shrimp with the head still on...probably an 18-20 count shrimp. My favorite bite was the gator sausage.Nice casual atmosphere with the drop plastic on the tables and adult size bibs. So yeah, it will be messy. Fun place over all and worth a stop for the Chowder.

The last time I came here not only did I get poor service, but the food was horrible. I use to adore this place and it use to be my go to place, but I think as the years gone by i slowly stop coming here cause I know how horrible it has gotten. When I came here it took them 10 mins to seat us. After seating us, it took them 10 mins to get the menu, then 10 mins to get water and for them to take our order. We than waited 20 mins for our apps to come out, and an additional 10 mins for our main food. Didn't even get the apron-bin thing until we asked, and the water was never refilled. I felt like my table was in some invisible force field that hid us from everyone, until the waiter remember the invisible table there. We would see the waiter walk around, stand around, chat around, but just remember us he doesn't. It even took the waiter a good 20 mins for us to get our check and pay. Now to my most heart breaking disappointment. The food. The chicken wing apps was good. Very flavorful as usual. The sweet potato fries was a bit of disappointment. Also they have us ketchup instead of fry sauce...I dunno what state we are in anymore (but not a big deal for me...maybe that was a bit dramatic). The seafood....oh the seafood...such a heartbreaking experience. We got two pound of shrimp, it was the worst quality shrimp ever. It was so mushy, it was impossible to peel. Before in the past the shrimp might have been frozen, but it was frozen fresh. The ease to peel it and the great crunch of freshly frozen cooked seafood. The crab legs was as well mushy...it was just too disappointing. I would have told the waiter about it, but I couldn't seem to have get their attention. So I waited 5 mins before I actually started to eat whatever I can, slurp whatever meat I could so I can have enough to fill my tummy up. I was even expecting to go to and go straight to the bathroom (thank god that didn't happened!!!!). I hope this was an off day for this place. It really breaks my heart to see it be so bad."}, {"review_id": "KNepSqcykcYfSMQdoiRBFQ", "user_id": "sKScibTLWlPOT5c306IDoQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "We came here for our Valentine's Day Dinner. We tried to call and have reservations, but no one was picking up. We decided to take a risk and drive there. If it was closed or whatever, we'd move on to the next one. Wow, when we walked in, the place was super packed. Of course, cause of Valentine's Day. I wish they had a sign that said, \"Come to the podium to sign in\" cause some other couples and us were just standing at the door for a good 20 min. Even the workers walking by just looked at us and didn't say anything. Other couples were generous enough to let me and my girlfriend go first cause they knew we were there for awhile. When we finally sat down, we started off with beers and Cajun Fries. Then ordered the Clams, Mussels, Crawfish, and Snow Crab Legs. My GF can't do spicy so we got the Mix non spicy. Coming from Texas and knowing all about the Asian Cajun boil, it wasn't too bad. I mean, it wasn't the greatest.. but I did like the size of the crawfish. Right now back in Dallas our crawfish is barely mid size. I liked the flavor cause it was more on the sweet side. My girlfriend didn't care much for it. She really wanted the Dungeness Crab, but they told us they couldn't cause it would take an hour to cook. Oh well. The plus side of this dinner was that I thought the tab would be over $100. It only came out to be $75. Not bad for a V-Day Dinner."}, {"review_id": "nPf5FzeoLbVbm2OEHwW6Mg", "user_id": "3XC_hCVpfkFANbdTNrTgnQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/21/2017", "text": "If you like seafood, this is the place!Likes: the seafood here is some of the freshest I've had in Utah. It tastes surprisingly fresh for a landlocked state. The shrimp prawns were huge and dense, not watered down or spongy like a lot of the shrimp you get elsewhere. My friend and I got shrimp and crawfish with medium hot Cajun sauce. The flavor was great. I could've handled a little bit more heat. This was my first time eating crawfish. They're not as much work as crab or lobster but you certainly don't get as much meat either. The meat itself tastes OK but I think I would probably prefer to get crab next time. The Cajun fries were great. The sweet potato fries are also very good. They could be a great way to cool your mouth down if you feel like your food is too hot.Dislikes: The sauce that came with our fries tasted off somehow. I'm not sure what was in it or if it was an attempt at fry sauce but it was gross.

Leticia made my table of four uncomfortable from the moment she stepped over to take our orders. She didn't take any notes on our drinks and then proceeded to repeat everything back to us incorrectly. Eventually she came to take our food order and was not giving us any kind of attention. She kept looking over on the side while we were talking to her and when asked if there was something going on she got extremely sassy and rude. She tried to make up for her attitude by filling up the waters but instead of bringing a pitcher over she grabbed our waters and brought the cups in the back to fill them up. The reason why I am giving this place three stars is because Leticia hovered over us when she handed us the check. She literally stood and waited until I got my cash out and proceeded to rip me on my change. I mean she LITERALLY did not give me a proper receipt on a 100 dollar bill and I was not given any of my coins. Yes, I know \"coins? Really?\" Well it just shows how slick she thinks she is. When I walked and asked her where my change was she knew exactly how much she stole from me.It was just a weird experience and Leticia was not a good server.

And my bag of crab was pretty good too. I went for the garlic butter option, but I thought it was a bit too strong for the crab flavor. However, when I received my [previously forgotten by my waiter] plain potatoes, I tossed them in the butter sauce and I FELL IN LOVE. I could've eaten those crabby garlicky buttery potatoes all night!The service wasn't fantastic.  I was alone and sat at the bar (it was Saturday and REALLY busy), and I was introduced to my waiter immediately. But after taking my order, he disappeared for at least 30 minutes. This was probably for the best though, since I was a bit of a mess.  But it would definitely not have been ideal for someone who might want drink refills or attention in general.I appreciated the plastic bag/bib/bucket/roll of paper towels setup.  It was liberating to splash in a puddle of butter and not feel out of place, especially since this behavior is frowned upon in most restaurants. I even shot a piece of crab clear across the bar when my greasy hands slipped while using my crab cracker and no one even looked up from their seafood bags.  In that moment, I knew I would definitely be back."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bucket-o-crawfish-west-valley-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
