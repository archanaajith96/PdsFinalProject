I had their salad (and added the whole birds chicken) and breakfast set. Both tasted amazing and their popcorn was a wonderful addition. I also ordered their house made soda. I prefer the Apple Cinnamon over the ginger ale, though both are solid optionals!Their service was great and I liked the fact that you could customize the menu. Also, when my friend got the wrong order the first time, the owner brought soup for him during the wait. That was very nice of them.Why only 4 stars? I do think their chicken salad was too salty. My random bites had salt grains, which I think is unnecessary. I believe other reviews have pointed out their saltiness with the whole birds option. I would agree as well!"}, {"review_id": "3K7F-9ZeYoRBteTVmKWHxg", "user_id": "tYIxOLwcZfnC5WrhtT0oUw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "...damn near left just now. I've eaten here a number of times. I've always enjoyed the food. For some reason this time as I sit and order a glass of wine and start to look at the dinner menu, I get ask to give them a credit card to open a tab to get the wine. I said but I'm ordering dinner as well. I say I've never had to start a tab to order wine with dinner. Anywhere. Anytime. Ever. BTW I'm in the restaurant, not at the bar.She got a bit befuddled, left, came back with the wine.

While the combinations were interesting, sometimes they worked and sometimes they didn't. Overall though, this was an average experience.Ambiance - Cute little cafe style where you can see the kitchen. It was cool to see how they were calling the orders and such.Service - You pay at the front, but they get the food out to you as soon as they can and that was much appreciated. Also patient with suggestions and recommendations. Food: - Thick cut grilled bread - best thing here. The bread was just so tasty and the butter and jam were delicious. I could have this everyday for the rest of my life.- Granola & yogurt - I would have been okay with this if it was just normal granola and yogurt but the addition of beets was just odd, not in a good way. - Fritatta - Decent fritatta and comes with a simple salad. Nothing special and the fritatta was a bit small. - French toast - The french toast was delicious, but was topped with sweet potato? It would have been perfectly fine without it, but the interesting addition was just odd. I didn't think it was terrible, but my friend absolutely did not like it. Pricing - At $15 for the amount of food we got, this was a fantastic deal. Overall, I personally thought this place was overrated and not as good as everyone made it out to be. Perhaps their regular menu was better, but brunch wise, this was an average place. Maybe chill with the extra additions, because sometimes the food doesn't need it."}, {"review_id": "djQOOUhLzMmo2rOxqZWnSw", "user_id": "GUQ5Odz0dY_afWUEJOefEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Great lunch spot in Omaha. Service is super super friendly. Kale salad is on the small side, but on point. Good combinations for the sandwiches like the sweet potato jam that has grilled sweet potato, sweet pepper jam, and homemade mozzarella. I'm not a vegetarian, but this sandwich was really good. And the levain was excellent. My only complaint would be that our to-go order for 3 salads and 2 sandwiches took 45 minutes to prepare. I mean... it was 3 of the same kale salad, so I would've expected you toss it all together and split it into three boxes... and how long could it take to put together a sandwich? But I won't complain because servers were just so nice and the food was really fresh and delicious."}, {"review_id": "UbtVppw8XKAeBXuqxJDHaA", "user_id": "5pQM0VxowzaLiKminAPrTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "This restaurant is friendly for special diets like vegan and GF.

Their slogan is, \"slow food fast,\" aiming to serve healthy foods literally and figuratively at the dinner table.  The restaurant itself is bright and green with little gourds and water plants on the table, adorable!Their menu consists of breakfast, snacks, cheese plates, soup, salads, and sandwiches. They also have a small selection of beers on tap, coffee beverages, and house-made sodas. They also feature a brunch menu and a dinner menu.I had a ginger ale, which was essentially a plain sparkling water (LaCroix) with a scratch syrup. I love the flavor of ginger, and this soda tasted like ginger, but its was way too sweet. It tasted like a simple syrup with a hint of ginger - I would have liked this drink to be more balanced. I did, admittedly, enjoy the cute paper straw. Trendy!I decided to order The Whole Bird sandwich, which featured chicken breast, confit leg salad (slow-cooked chicken), crispy chicken skin, a fried egg, and sauteed greens on toasted homemade levain bread. I'm very scared of dry chicken which is usually why i stay away from it. Thank goodness, this chicken was so moist and tasty! It was a great combination with the egg and the crispy skin. The only thing it was missing was some heat, but the restaurant has hot sauce and homemade ketchup available - which greatly improved this sandwich.I also love that the sandwich was served with a spiced popcorn. Honestly, popcorn doesn't make enough appearances in my regular life! As much as I love french fries and potato chips, popcorn makes me feel a little less awful.My dad had the Hummus Salad, which featured hummus, dukkah (a middle-eastern spice and nut blend), pickled veggies (red peppers, carrots, and cauliflowers), country queen cheese, and a kale and sprouts salad with red wine vinaigrette. On the side were four pieces of toasted levain bread.My dad liked it a lot, and has boldly claimed to offer no critique on this dish! I nibbled a little bit at his plate, and I thought the homemade hummus and pickled veggies were very good! Kitchen Table is very intentional about offering fresh, seasonal, and local food which is evident in their dishes. My dad and I enjoyed our food, it was well-portioned and tasty. I only have small personal preference-related changes on my dishes, a little spicier ginger ale and a spicier chicken sandwich. In addition, all of their dishes are $10 and under, which is affordable for high quality and beautifully presented food. I would recommend this for a nice lunch any day!"}, {"review_id": "Xo7NqU1WcLvezzXplqsxbg", "user_id": "l63QwNwi7175v69eGIqH_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "The Whole Bird - like others have said in the review this sandwich is too salty.

The house popcorn is not mediocre - it's the bomb diggity! They just must have been off their seasoning game the first time I went because I tried it again (even asked if I could sub it with pickles or something but they said no) and it was perfection. It had a smokey flavor my friends and I could not pin down. I apologize for ever doubting you KT.The eggplant jam was also a flavor party in my mouth - I don't know what they did to that eggplant but it was sooo good! Only con was I got the butt end of the loaf this time and it was much more crunchy than the bread I had the first time. And their 1-2-3 Sunday brunch! For $15 I was stuffed - their frittata was a HUGE slice, with plenty of sausage, tomatoes and cheese in every bite. But the star of this week's brunch was definitely the roasted squash salad. It was my first time having delicata squash and it was the best thing ever. Sweeter and creamier than butternut (my previous favorite). Kabocha (Japanese pumpkin) is a bit tougher and the texture kind of dries out your mouth, but that's how it was when I cooked it too. Overall, just an amazing medley of flavor with the tang and nuttiness from the browned butter vinaigrette, ginger, and sage. KT hit it out of the ballpark with this one. GET IT (if you're lucky enough to see it again as their menu rotates). You also have the option to order anything from their brunch menu a la carte. And the food came out super fast - always a plus in my book.KT is easily my favorite of Farnam Street's triple threat (to your taste buds of course!). Sorry, B16 and Culprit."}, {"review_id": "OrinnaGW6h11EmE7qr32qw", "user_id": "hFuyKEJKdJs0NqACqca-yw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/19/2018", "text": "I was a bit underwhelmed by Kitchen Table. I really liked the concept and the menu looked interesting to me. I very much enjoy sandwiches of all types and ordered The Whole Bird sandwich + the pulled pork Reuben. The whole bird sandwich- ate a bit dry, which is odd given the fried egg and confit. I liked the bitterness of the greens but I still felt  the sandwich was dry and, honestly, lacked flavor. The chicken breast was not juicy and I think other elements (either a sauce or spice or something) would have helped.The pulled pork reuben was a solid sandwich. Everything went together well and the texture, sauce, and bread were good (I was glad that the bread was a bit thicker here as it held it together). The popcorn was a nice touch but did not add a ton for me. All in all, I thought Kitchen Table was just okay. With its close proximity to Block 16, I would not come back here. The service and atmosphere were both good but not enough for me to return."}, {"review_id": "GcX0KCZEd0KVpmEqjANvtA", "user_id": "4QGfZc15B9Fn2lSOz4f_KA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/4/2017", "text": "Cute farm-to-table joint with wood finishings and simple decor. I got the Whole Bird Sandwich (seared chicken breast, crispy skin, confit leg salad, fried egg, greens sandwiched between toasted levain bread). **Friend told me it's named \"whole bird\" because it has chicken AND egg... +5 pt. for creativity** This chicken sandwich definitely lives up to the many hype reviews about it. The chicken breast wasn't dry which is a PLUS and the egg had the perfect yolky consistency. Only thing was the sauce was pretty salty and I found myself taking sips of water with each bite.Each sandwich comes with a good amount of popcorn flavored with their house seasoning on the side which I thought matched their wholesome theme. If you want a simple but tasty meal that won't leave you with that regretfully full feeling definitely give this place a try!"}, {"review_id": "8oc2sncm2oPYN2TjollXtw", "user_id": "LhQVP8v4waUhOssPISCPug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/4/2017", "text": "I have to give this place five stars for multiple reasons 1.the creativity of all the food 2.everything is local and fresh grown 3.

I'm really glad we did, because I had one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life here. It was called The \"brunch burger\" and it was simply put together with quality, local ground beef, really good mustard, fresh greens and a perfectly fried egg on top. I asked for medium-rare and I got medium-rare, and it was perfectly seasoned. The house-made bun was also perfect. Only complaint is that it is on the pricier side-- $10 for the moderately-sized burger only, no sides. Still, I don't mind paying it. It was so good that I forgot to take a photo. Their house ginger ale was also amazing. Fresh and just sweet and fizzy enough, the way I like it. Service was fast and friendly, but thankfully I caught them before the crowd came through.I can't wait to come back here. I bet my husband will love their 1, 2, 3 brunch menu, which for $15 is fair because that's a lot of food.
