The host asked if we had a reservation (which we did not) despite the place being half empty.  He then went to go check with someone to see if we could be seated.  It almost felt like a \" we don't want your kind\" kind of statement.  When the host came back, I told him we could sit outside in front in one of the rod iron tables.  He suggested the back patio area instead.  Cool I thought, until we were seated next to the trash can lol.  I really didn't hold this too much against them except the smell wasn't appetizing.  Luckily somebody eventually emptied it.Anyway, we started off with drinks and I got a perfectly made Sazerac and the ladyfriend got a dirty martini.  The martini was extra dirty...aka it was like drinking olive juice.  She ordered a seafood gumbo to eat that was a dark roux with tomato and okra (which in Nola is reserved for non-seafood gumbos).  She really enjoyed it though.  I ordered the special of the day which was a Sheepshead on top of corn grits and a side of Brussel sprounts.  The Sheepshead came with a sour cream like sauce that was overpowering.  The fish was actually flavored perfectly without it.  Once It scrapped off the sauce, the meal was phenomenally good.  The service was solid, the food was good, the atmosphere inside seemed nice just make sure to dress appropriately lol.  There are a few holes but overall I'd definitely come back if I was in the area."}, {"review_id": "hSAliu-oglRyg5bewOlODw", "user_id": "wTfb2nfzPIyFcYQArdPtuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "BACKGROUNDWe heard from a co-worker that her German boyfriend, Dirk, loves this restaurant. Apparently, he is quite picky. So since he recommended it, we had high expectations.THE ROYAL SCAMThe Royal Scam is the fifth album by Steely Dan, originally released by ABC Records in 1976. But is that what David Rasp was referring to when he opened The Royal Scam in late 2006?The Royal Scam started as just an upscale bar with a small tapas menu but soon grew into a full service downtown restaurant for lunch and dinner. David Rasp, who also owns Heroes Sports Bar and Grille, appears to know what he is doing and has wonderful staff to assist. THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCEOur reservations were at 7pm. The Uber dropped us off out front at 7:15. We called ahead to say we were going to be late. They said, \"No problem!\" Which we appreciated.There were a couple empty metal tables out front. We walked in and the place was basically full, except for a table in the front by the window, overlooking Royal Street, directly across from the Renaissance Mobile Riverview Plaza, in downtown Mobile, Alabama.We were seated immediately and our server, Chris, brought the menus and took our drink order. I ordered the Flirtini, which is Tito's, Raspberry Liqueur, Triple Sec, Sweet and Sour, Pineapple Juice, and Champagne.For the appetizer, I had the Seared Ahi Tuna and Lemon Ginger Gastrique with a Spicy Mango Salad and the Baby Greens salad (Baby Field Greens, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Red Onion, Apple, Toasted Almonds and Orange Basil Vinaigrette, with Bleu Cheese Crumbles). For the entrée, I had the Petite Filet, which was a 6 oz Filet with Veal Demi-Glace. Served with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Grilled Asparagus.For dessert, I had Tiramisu (Ladyfingers Laced With Coffee, Layered With Sweet Cream & Dusted With Cocoa Powder).CONCLUSIONEverything was DELICIOUS and served quickly and correctly by our server, Chris, the first time. The environment was extremely casual, which makes sense, because that's exactly what they claim: \"The Royal Scam is the epitome of casual fine dining.\"Would we come back?

The salad exploded with flavor between the apple chunks, sun dried tomatoes, sliced almond, and light but sweet dressing. The mango salad had just a twinge of spice to take normal sweet mangoes to the next level of intrigue. The sandwich was also quite delectable. My only critique would be to find a way to keep the mangoes from making the sandwich bun soggy. The bread was also a bit large for the salmon.I was overall pleased and satisfied and would definitely come back if work brings me this way again:)"}, {"review_id": "cWa0DJNz-81iVQlA8MHzwA", "user_id": "s8XNesnX1_VYTdzuJQ9Wgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "We have been here a lot but not for a while.
