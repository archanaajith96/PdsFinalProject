Was here with my family for Sunday Brunch and we all had great meals! I had chicken and waffles and they were spectacular! Sweet, spicy and crispy! My dad had bottomless bloody Mary's and he was not disappointed! My whole family, including myself, ate our entire meals!The atmosphere is great! It reminded me of a speakeasy! There was a live band and everyone around seemed to be in great spirits! That included the customers and staff!  Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu! I will definitely be returning to this restaurant for the great food, awesome drink menu and fantastic service!"}, {"review_id": "ZvF31WOm1ahXMD0KMx5JhQ", "user_id": "pbYpFtE5_0sCbDZvowXOyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Enjoyed a long lunch with apps, craft beers and entrees. Wait staff hit the right spot between attentiveness and leaving us to enjoy our time together.Appetizers were wonderful and we maybe should have just kept ordering those like tapas! Four of us shared Biscuits with Pimento, Fried Wings and Maple Pork Belly.Pork belly is an incredible indulgence. Melts in your mouth, like bacon on steroids with a sweet, but not overpowering maple glaze. If I thought my arteries could stand it, I'd make Walrus + Carpenter's pork belly my whole meal.For entrees two of us had chicken and waffles and two had fried chicken. My southern companions declared the fried chicken quite good by Yankee standards. Chicken and waffles were also made with fried chicken and a spicy glaze.Comfy atmosphere and a very enjoyable 2 1/2 hour Saturday late lunch. Thank you for a wonderful time with my future son-in-law, his father and grandfather. Perfect place to bring them."}, {"review_id": "rn6SGxjlnbPkmf2KA4xlfA", "user_id": "IZ08NiyIBv2bwF1BF4oDkQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Returned and had the Pork Belly Burnt Ends $12, the Fried Oysters $14, the WC Burger + Fries $15 and the Pulled Pork + Fries $15.  The burger was my favorite by far.  It was amazing!  Had a couple unique IPA's and a Christmas brew to wash it all down.  Sat at the bar where service was very good.  This is still a great spot and I'll be returning regularly."}, {"review_id": "LtnysN7SC6FNlrg8B_i2GQ", "user_id": "G986OSrZf0mA1YVG7BDnHg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "excellent place to bring kids, pretty good tap list. but unfortunately ran out of at least 2 items that we had to order.

Hush puppies were pretty good, wings disappointing- One entree was the Tennessee hot chicken sandwich which was very good! This was the lone bright spot.Now the really bad part...Do not order the baby back ribs! I've eaten ribs all over the country including several spots in CT and these were atrocious. Two people in my party ordered these and they were not edible.First they came out cold and appeared to be undercooked - rubbery and hard to even pull off the bone, much less fall off. Then to top it off they smelled awful of kerosene/ propane which clearly comes from their smoking process which is ruining their ribs. We sent them back to be warmed up and they came out just smelling worse. I've read this though many reviews on here as well over the years so owner needs to address this ASAP.Cool place with a few bright spots but a smokehouse/bbq joint can't screw up ribs this bad!"}, {"review_id": "DJnRUgFCdEI9Sz-6Cw5mqw", "user_id": "pA-UNC54jxVKFqJT6j3lbg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/28/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We really wanted to enjoy this place but were disappointed. The portions were a lot smaller than what we imagined and the food itself wasn't the best tasting. OrderedMac & Cheese: not the version your grandma made during bbqs but decent overall. Small plate of Poutine & Nachos: these two dishes were actually good, especially the poutine. If we had just ordered these two dishes we wouldn't have left so disappointed. Large plate of Southern fried chicken & the Pork shoulder: the fried chicken had a weird texture and I jokingly said we could've gone to Popeyes for better. The best part of the dish was the honey. Now my other honey sitting next to me thought his dish was too fatty. I knew he didn't enjoy it when he left the majority on his plate and didn't want to wrap it up. *We noticed these \"larger\" plates were the same size as the small plates. Also, no refills on fountain drinks which is a little odd.The decor was trendy and they played Bob Marley which gave it a cool vibe. We loved the exposed brick!We won't eat in again but may order the poutine to go in the future."}, {"review_id": "lKIGQYyRKQps1QbhTLPkEQ", "user_id": "jrza1L6X2EIXfk76zUTV9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "The Ultimate Guide to walrus+carpenter Maple Pork belly: 8.5/10Big slab of pork belly covered in thin somewhat sweet syrup. If you're a fan of fat this is pure bliss. Pork belly burnt ends: 9/10Southern fried chicken: 9/10 Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. Everything fried chicken should be. Smoked pork nuggets: 6.5/10. Interesting idea that falls short. You get bite sized fried balls of pork and a bbq sauce. Greasy and not all that flavorful. Biscuits: 10/10. So damn good. Buttery and perfectly topped with salt and pepper. Butter is great as well.Collard greens: 6/10Bland and salty. The quality of the meat in the greens can vary a lot. Coleslaw: 3/10. Like the coleslaw you get in a two tablespoon plastic cup at a bad seafood place. Mushrooms: 10/10Great mix of textures, the umami and oniony combination is unbeatable. Sneakily one of the best things on the menuCheddar grits: 8/10The amount of cheese and butter is transcendent, for like 3 bites. The dish overwhelms after that, but in small portions it is heavenly. Mac and Cheese: 7.5/10.Could honestly use more cheese.Brussels Sprouts: 9/10. A simple flavorful dish that won't disappoint. Mashed potatoes: 8.5/10. Darn good mashed potatoes. Not lacking in salt or butter. Cornbread: 10/10Sweet, moist and buttery. Very decadent. Could serve as dessert. Pickles:11/10Not a typo. These are the best pickled cukes I have ever had. They aren't very sweet and they have a little kick. Poutine: 9.5/10The fries are crispy enough to hold up the gravy. The bowl swims with squeaky curds and rich gravy. An excellent balanced poutine. This dish is heavenly. One small wish is for a more impactful gravy. But seriously give me a beer and a bowl of this and I'm set. Animal style poutine: 6.5/10Just don't order this.Brisket poutine:9.5/10If you want to add some protein, umami and general heartiness to your poutine this is the way to go. The brisket compliments the other elements fantastically. Smoked pork tacos:9.5/10Honestly one of the best things on the menu. Chipotle wings: 9/10Delicious, big, smoked wings. Sauce is meh. Raw Oysters: 10/10Earthy Oysters. Fried oysters: 9/10Plate comes with five oysters each sitting atop a dollop of delicious roumolade. These guys are flat out delicious. The batter and sauce compliment the fishiness delightfully. Pork rind nachos: 7/10These are just weird. Wings and rings blues plate: 10/10These are the best hot wings I have ever gotten at a restaurant. The meat is the star of the plate. The flavor of the smoke is great. If I am ever at W+C on a Wednesday this plate is being ingested. Maple Baby-back ribs: 9/10 The sauce on these ribs is phenomenal, if you like bourbon. The quality of the meat has varied the different times I've gotten this dish. Ranging from beautifully tender to tough and stringy. Jezebel Spare Ribs: 6/10The jezebel sauce and quality of meat are inferior to the other ribs. Pork Shoulder: 8/10The pork is slow roasted melt in your mouth goodness, and you get a lot of it. If you hate fat you may want to steer clear, as the cut of meat can be rather voluptuous. WC Burger: 6.5/10It's a solid pub burger, but the fries are where it loses me. Pulled pork sandwich: 8/10Sandwich is a bit one note for me, both pallet and texture wise.Walrus Pie:10/10If you can tuck in dessert do yourself a favor and get this. It's a whole lot of peanut butter ice cream and rich chocolate stuffed into a crumb crust. On top is a piece of candied bacon. The salty sweet combo and textural variety is unbeatable. It's a memorable dessert, and one you can't get just anywhere. Bread pudding:8/10 Ginger-Nutmeg Chess pie: 7-10/10I've gotten this twice and both times the filling has been amazing. It's not too dense as chess pies often are, and the ginger plays beautifully with the pies inoffensive sweetness. One time the crust was solid and not necessarily memorable(which is what a pie crust should be), but the second time the crust was downright awful. It was poofy and flavorless and bordered on rubbery. It was flat out inedible, but the filling is so good it still gets the 7/10. That says something about this pie. Apple Crisp: 8/10 You won't be disappointed. Notorious PIG (2nd Course pictured) This is so unbelievably worth ordering. It feeds 4 very hungry big eaters or 5 or 6 sane adults. You get to try so much good food and there is something for pretty much everyone. It's the only time you can get the andouille sausage straight up. Just wish you could get the regular poutine instead of animal style. A memorable experience that may put you into a food coma for the foreseeable future."}, {"review_id": "dHCPVxM-q2azEfwBlkzBWQ", "user_id": "O2_lCjyITFiC7F7RgI3HeA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Started with the chipotle wings which were a good size , solid 7/10 for flavor , then had the baby back rib meal with the Mac and cheese side . After taking a few bites into the rib I couldn't eat anymore . It tasted very metallic , almost as if it were cooked directly over a propane flame , had all 6 people try it and NONE liked it at all. The Mac and cheese was excellent and most people got the Tennessee hot chicken and pulled pork , both which were good. The poutine app was also very bland, the cheese curds were not the traditional poutine squeaky cheese curds that melt over the fries, and the gravy was very bland, also not recommended . Nothing amazing and very over priced , if you're looking for bbq you can find much better places, tho its a nice place for drinks and getting together with friends."}, {"review_id": "B8ERcswnjDFuvJSX5I1iXA", "user_id": "2JsW3vxonAtUFsb-vxO25Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Ordered the steak and it was over cooked and tasted like you were eating leather and the ribs were undercooked and stuck to the bone, they were not even edible.This place is terrible"}, {"review_id": "_LsTZDAWAxsDWPhB4rIQ8g", "user_id": "9qSNf8YBfA2Vdt_ikm1nkw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2017", "text": "Having visited Walrus + Carpenter two times now for over-the-top gluttonous man dates with my boys, I can say that the food here is really quite good. With a serious lack of quality BBQ joints along coastal CT, I'm willing to pay the premium for the delicious albeit salty as hell barbequed cuisine here. The interior décor is tastefully done, with a rustic gastropub feel that provides the perfect surroundings for the delicious food that comes out of the kitchen. Lots of oak wood tables, exposed brick, a long wood bar, and dark toned leathers truly encapsulate the smokehouse feel. Being a self-proclaimed bourbon snob, the selection here is excellent albeit it overpriced. But tis the reality of the bourbon bubble world we live in, and a high price tag often accompanies that rare juice access. Melody the bar tender mixes up some really excellent cocktails. The traditional Manhattan was extremely well balanced, with none of that overpowering sweet vermouth flavor that you find in a lot of Manhattys. My buddy got the Billionaire (Bakers bourbon, lemon sugar, absinthe, grenadine) and some wine and liquor layered cocktail garnished with thyme sprigs that was also quite good. Creative, well-executed cocktails are always a plus in my book!I wasn't kidding when I said over-the-top, gluttonous ordering and here is what me and my boy got just for the two of us:1. Smoked Chicken Wings (chipotle honey) - Covered in ooey, gooey chipotle honey sauce, these excellent wings were crisp on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside. 2. Fried oysters (preserved lemon, shallot, old bay mayo) - Dredged with that corn meal outer crust that gives it that crunchy contrast to the mousy texture that is an oyster, these little poppers provided great little bite size snacks3. Hush puppies - fried with what could have been a pancake batter dredge, but probably just cornmeal, these little balls were delish!4. House cured male pork belly - yep, tastes as good as it sounds.5. Baby back ribs (bourbon bbq sauce) side of baked mac and cheese, described by our server as juicy and bolder than the dry-rubbed spare ribs, these were just as described and the meat was cooked just the way you want it, fall-off-the-bone tender.6. Spare ribs (jezebel sauce) side of creamed spinach - bigger and meatier than their baby back brothers, the inherent dryness of these bigger ribs provided a nice contrast and the well-seasoned rub shined through7. Southern fried chicken (sriracha-honey) - damn that honey with fried chicken combo is truly the ONLY way to consume fried chicken. Pieces were a little small this last time, but overall some quality pieces of fried chicken8. Beignets - came with a tart dark chocolate sauce, a decadent way to end a truly over the top meal.9. A slice of some multi-layered ice-cream cake dessert - it had peanuts and I'm allergic, so can't comment on this one. Overall I am a fan of W+C. People complain about the higher than average price for their smoked meats, but not this guy. Quality comes at price in my book and at W+C they serve some quality meats!"}, {"review_id": "y6-_yz_w1KeDvQuebM0KMg", "user_id": "s1at6Spm-RtNSxFXtpyUng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Came here for a few drinks and ended up having dinner too, We ordered the the fried chicken and roasted mushrooms also some baby back ribs and baked mac and cheese, Everything was super tasty and well seasoned, just wish the ribs would've been warmer but besides I can't wait to come again.

And sat. 30 minutes later our order was finally taken, and we sat for another 30 minutes until our waitress showed again. She brought drinks, but informed us they were out of pancakes but had waffles.That blunder created another 45 minute wait. When the food was brought out it was pretty good.  During that long wait no-one asked us about our status (another drink, water, bread, etc.).  Recap: 2 1/2 hours from expected seating time (12:30) to live-sustaining  sustenance delivery. They did comp our drinks, but FYI, don't schedule anything important after your assumed reservation time.

There's a really detailed review below by Rathy C. laying out all the reasons the food here isn't true BBQ, but I'll leave it to your discretion to read for  yourself. W+C is a really cute place, I'll give it that, and I'm sure business will continue to boom despite some of the awful reviews it's gotten. But be warned, if you actually care about good food at a decent price and more importantly good service, you might want to sit this one out.I sat at the bar to try some drinks and dessert one time. The Walrus Pie was decadent and did not disappoint, but the drinks were overpriced as mentioned by other reviewers.The main reason for my 1-star review is because I've been flat-out ignored on two separate occasions after stepping through the door. Both times, hostess and/or waitstaff saw me (and even WALKED PAST me) but showed 0 acknowledgement. I get that it can get busy, but that's no excuse for not even a \"Hi, we'll be with you in a moment\"Both times I waited a few minutes longer before turning around and walking out the door.
