Obviously attracted to the good reviews that were on Yelp lol. The restaurant was pretty empty when we went, so we were seated quickly. They have a variety of Cambodian, Chinese, and fusion dishes. We stuck with the \"specials\" - chicken curry soup and pork and egg soup. Both amazing! The chicken curry had a nice coconut taste, but we wished it was a wee bit more spicy. The pork and egg soup was also delicious...peppery, sweet, and tender! We got both dishes with 2 sides of rice and it was a lot for us to handle. We will probably stop by again next time we go cross country. Great food for a great value. If you're driving on I90, it's worth the small detour!"}, {"review_id": "ucSxVZxfHDUjQca7m60CdQ", "user_id": "_kSbuZlcen8sjeiVhKj4Fg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "We were stoked to stumble in for a late lunch on a road trip.

We tried the lunch specials and got the shrimp fried rice, which was probably the best thing we had. Also had the Kung Pao chicken which had some weird hard pieces I had to spit out, the fried rice is just plain lightly fried rice so don't expect it to come with vegetables or egg. The wonton soup was good and so was the crab Rangoon. Maybe we should have gone with the fusion food because the lunch specials weren't enough to bring us back."}, {"review_id": "pP3L04kgFqhoJ5hUCVsqew", "user_id": "EMMKdK1cGrLSo08wgSYHJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2017", "text": "We had a short business trip through Sioux Falls and so I opted to skip the optional business socials to find a few local gems on my own. I'm always interested to sample Asian foods throughout the Midwest (a decidedly under served area vs the coasts) and have had some terrible meals, and some great ones along the way. Phnom Penh gets 5 stars from me because in a small city like Sioux Falls where the Asian population is in the minority, this is some seriously good eats. Now if we took this restaurant to the coasts I would still give it a 3.5 for the traditional menu- so that's something to consider- although I did not try their famous curry dish.We avoided the Americanized menu and went straight for the yummy looking Cambodian food. It was a Lent Friday so we were limited to what menu items we could try (was hoping to try the chicken curry but perhaps next time). The fried tilapia and the seafood crepes were both perfect choices for our hungry bellies. I would have wished the banh xeo was a bit crispier on the crepe part, but I dont know if it's supposed to be as the Vietnamese version is.The decor is normal for a family run place, and the staff was attentive even though it was crazy busy in there. Most of the patrons we saw ordered from the more Americanized Chinese menu but I highly suggest trying something new the next time you go.  Overall, a good place to grab a bite!"}, {"review_id": "kMJZksE7clmuOTMruFRW_w", "user_id": "swF_o9MtCT1MPZvWFgRzYg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "5 stars considering location and sheer experience. I was on a road trip through the United States and Sioux Falls was one of our stops for food. Since we were halfway through the country, we wanted something unique and figured Cambodian would be a great option! And Yelp was right again. Phnom Penh is located in a small strip mall off the highway, near the airport, and not quite in town. There are quite a few ethnic stores and shops around as well. It confused me at first that it was Cambodian and Americanized Chinese - but I figured to keep afloat in this area, it's not enough to make amazing homemade Cambodian food. Which is a shame but we had such a wonderful experience.My boyfriend and I couldn't decide because we never truly experienced Cambodian food before. So on the waiter's suggestion, we ordered the curry chicken stew with rice noodles and crepes. And boy were they amazing. I've never had this before but I want it again. The chicken was nicely stewed and tasted wonderful; especially paired with the rice noodles that sopped up all that curry. It was a sweet curry and we asked to make it spicy but we could certainly go spicier. The crepes were also something; they were in an eggy crepe with lettuce for you to wrap the crepes and dip into a fish sauce. So flavorful and delicious!I really wish I had a Cambodian place by me; the love and care for the food shows. The waiter even mentioned that his mother was the main cook! So much respect for a family business. Loved it here and a great stop on our trip!"}, {"review_id": "lFy06jI-1QIBLzm1cvQ_2w", "user_id": "XatJ1Tkqw5dw5n7WeWr_FA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/31/2017", "text": "You know how Asian food always comes out crazzzzy fast?

The dining area is a large open room with funky blue and orange booths and the usual Asian art spread across the walls. The lovely lady that sat us was also our server. She was very kind, helpful, and attentive. Instead of trying any main courses for our first trip, we went for a variety of appetizers and a rare steak soup which ended up not so rare as it continued to cook in hot soup -- no problem, still delicious. The bowl of soup was huge, at least 3- 4 servings worth. The apps we tried:Beef stick - $2 basic steak skewer with an Asian glazeSpring roll - Pork and shrimp - light fresh and deliciousEgg roll - light flaky shell that lacked any oil flavor which can be a problem. Clean fryer = better taste and this was done right!Sesame balls for dessert came out soft, hot, and great flavor. I don't give 5 stars often, but I couldn't find a good reason not to in this case. I would say the only thing lacking would be ambience. They had light Asian music playing at the same time with the TV."}, {"review_id": "zuASOcfcYW7ejcUeVUfvnw", "user_id": "_EjInKrLTpYRVMgYwvddEg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Not really good food, not authentic, portion sizes were really small.

The staff are friendly, but they only have one server, and when the place is full, she is serving up to 12 tables. Even 6 or 7 leads to substantial waits.But still four stars because they update the menu frequently, and they have dishes you can't get anywhere else in town. The broth in the hot pot is delicious, the noodle salads are refreshing, and the Cambodian curry is hearty. The unique stuff here is the Cambodian dishes, though they also serve standard Americanized Chinese.

I walked in with the lowest possible expectations and left feeling indifferent. To sum up my entire experience - \"The food here isn't bad...for the Midwest. It could've been worse.\" The noodle soup came with very little pieces of brisket and tripe, I counted about 4 bite sized pieces of brisket and maybe a spoonful of tripe. The soup was kind of boring, it wasn't hearty or flavorful compared to what I'm used to. I tried adding hoisin sauce and it turned out to be too sweet. It definitely didn't taste like the regular hoisin sauce, I think they modified it to suit their regular customers. The more interesting thing I had was the num ansom chrouk which reminded me of a Chinese sticky rice tamale aka joong. It was served with a dipping sauce mixed with chopped peanuts. If you're not a fan of fish sauce I wouldn't get this dish, it was either in the dipping sauce or sticky rice itself but it dominated most of the flavor. So about half the menu was your standard American Chinese dishes, think orange chicken, imperial delight and fried rice. However they do offer Cambodian food, personally I'd say as long as you stick to the Cambodian food you should be alright. The American Chinese dishes were probably made to cater to majority of the customers they get, so I forgive them for that. Honestly, things could've been worse. I could've gotten a bowl of spaghetti served with MSG soup but luckily that didn't happen. This is probably as good as it gets when you're in a land of nothing in South Dakota. P.S. The fried garlic tasted really old and stale, so avoid that if you can, I think it's served with their noodle soups."}, {"review_id": "2YGGjFuztV4FvoAzmzUsew", "user_id": "3OejVq4e4uMCpQpcjOh3VQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "I've traveled to different parts of the world and different parts of America.

My first meal here since then happened to be my first time having Cambodian food and I loved it! Service was mega-friendly and excellent especially with an endearing upper Midwest accent. Dishes were prepared with homemade care and could be shared family-style.Our server who seemed to be the owner greeted us at the door and seated us right away. To drink, I had the Khmer Egg Soda made with condensed milk and egg which could definitely be considered a treat. It was yummy though a bit too sweet for me. It would definitely satisfy folks with a sweet tooth.We ordered a bunch of dishes including Chicken with Sticky Rice (a very red succulent chicken accompanied by glutinous rice) and Banhn Chao (yellow crepes with our choice of ground beef and onion filling accompanied by a liquidy sweet and sour sauce). All were delicious in their own rite, but standout dishes were the Lok Lak Steak, similar in flavor to a mild Filipino beef adobo with apparent vinegar/soysauce/garlic notes and the Khmer Chicken Curry with deep flavors in a rich curry broth. White and brown rice were served as endless bowls-  a major plus for this rice lover, but I actually didn't need that much.
