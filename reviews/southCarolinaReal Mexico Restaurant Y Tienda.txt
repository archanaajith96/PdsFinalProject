Be adventurous. Best, freshest Mexican food in Columbia.  Always crowded but never have to wait more than five to ten minutes--it's a mystery to me.  Parking can be tight, but here's a tip: at night you can park across the street in the dentist's office.  Things to order--Sante Fe chimichangas, chipotle chicken tacos, any of the fajita options, bacon quesadilla, really anything.  The salsa is a little weak for my taste, so I usually ask for them to also bring out the spicy stuff.  I've only had drinks here a few times---remember them being just okay, but I'm not going there for the drinks. Service is always great."}, {"review_id": "Hffi_par3cDap5dVYxSMFA", "user_id": "O2Rx3GwvuXgKZmwgvKc9bw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "A great find on our recent trip to Columbia.Pros:Service was fantastic.Food was at a great price point, with a proper amount of seasoning.Salsa was the right amount of heat.Food was plentiful.Great to see charro beans as an option besides refried beans.Cons:Queso dip was on the watery side.Margarita, while tasty, felt a bit weak.Could certainly see our group visiting again, I would love to try the shrimp tacos on my next visit."}, {"review_id": "OOpc-5-8jgg6VT7QMuQ_Lw", "user_id": "cwZJwdm-6ttjFABXLyeV3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Ordered molcajete, choribpollo torta, loco bean dip, beef tacos, seafood fiesta, and quesadillas - all very tasty and fast service.  I loved my molcajete with their house hot sauce!  Must order and try that"}, {"review_id": "cCkvjQc8Ku8ajA7qvN-J4A", "user_id": "1aah9YdCNeLL19cir15J4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "So it took me a while to put two and two together, that the Real Mexico food truck at the Saturday Soda City Markets and the restaurant are actually the same business. I've had food from both and love food from both. I always get elotes from the food truck to eat while strolling the Saturday market. Swoon. The restaurant has a hole-in-the-wall vibe, and parking sucks, but where else can you get five shrimp tacos for like $7.xx?? It's always good to grab a table early, because it's the best Mexican I've had in Columbia so far.
