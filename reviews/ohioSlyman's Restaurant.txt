Near flawless sandwich.If you are from out of town, make sure to go on a day they are actually open and go early.

I was determined to rectify that during my last trip to Cleveland.I stopped in for lunch one cool, misty, rainy afternoon around 1:30 pm. The place was packed to the gills. I decided not to wait for a table to open up - so I waited in line to place an order to go - the wait was not long.I ordered a Corned Beef on Rye - (comes with Swiss cheese) and some sort of mustard (not yellow) and mayo. Plus a dill pickle spear.I took it back to my hotel to eat - I could not wait to dig in!Lean corned beef was sliced razor thin and piled high! It was Oh so tender and succulent! I could only eat half the sandwich and saved the other half for later!Wow! Can't wait to come back and try more Corned Beef sandwich variants! And I need to come back for breakfast to try their version of Corned Beef Hash - made with real Slymans corned beef!Excellent! Mindbending!

People all over the country have heard of this Mecca of all things corned beef. Sitting Presidents have come here. Actors, musicians, and other famous people have also strolled through its doors for one of their mammoth sandwiches. This review is straight forward as this is a straight forward place with a simplistic menu. Corned beef sandwiches. Built with a metric ton of hot, buttery corned beef on two slices of rye. You also get extra bread to make more sandwiches if you can't handle it one setting, which is a monumental task that probably requires an entire day of fasting beforehand. The sandwiches are great and come with a kosher dill pickle on the side. If you want to fill your belly with the area's best corned beef and visit a Cleveland landmark all in one visit, this is the place to go. Just make sure you have plenty of time for the food coma that is sure to follow, but you will have a giant smile on your face!"}, {"review_id": "-vfA1l_gMif1_o43w9QnoQ", "user_id": "8AIrfpqWl_O4vX1mEzETeg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Cleveland institution that you have to try if you're in Cleveland.

The restaurant itself is not in a horrible area of town but a few blocks in either direction and you'll end up on a milk carton LOL. Seriously don't let the location keep you from going.All joking aside you really cannot go wrong with having a meal from Slyman's Lee's Sandwiches you should really consider sharing with somebody because they are that big. I picked up a catering order for my work and the employees there could not have been more helpful to me. Parking can be a little challenging around lunch time there's almost no parking behind the restaurant but there is street parking.Overall I cannot add to the other 9005 star reviews that are on here other than I cannot wait to go back"}, {"review_id": "VuSvAGx07ij-p4Qs24BFJw", "user_id": "_pkwfwQx9--_sueH4yJ6hg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/14/2017", "text": "Complaint:generic frozen fries.

Anyway, my burger was very tasty and it was only $6.00!  That's a far cry from $14.50 for corned beef. It came with lettuce, onion, and tomato and I would definitely order it again.
