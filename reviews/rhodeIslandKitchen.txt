This made me curious. We dropped our car off at the shop about a block away and decided to try this place out. Waited in line for about 30 minutes before  we got a table.  I looked at the other people's plates and everything looked so good. I don't remember the name of the plate I ordered but it was the best ever. The pancakes were out of this world. Just like everyone else is saying, you have to eat the bacon. My wife got the juevos rancheros. I loved it too. Never had it like that before.  The prices were a little more than I'm used to paying for breakfast but believe me it's well worth it. Unbelievably good food and service will keep me coming back."}, {"review_id": "bpqvTgGxXY2Wqkx6qTk0yw", "user_id": "64_oR591ReMsc5RPQKAcLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Came on a rainy Saturday around 10 am and had an hour and a half long wait in line. The place is warm and intimate. There's five or so tables, one chef and one waitress. If you can get over the fact that you're being gawked at by a line of starving strangers, the vibe is great. Blueberry corn muffin was bomb. Moist, not too sweet, crispy, soft. The grilling was an awesome touch. Did the big breakfast. Eggs were perfectly cooked, potatoes were amazingly flavorful, French toast was solid. The bacon was good, it tastes like a big thick slab of pork belly. I won't say it changed my life or that it's the best I've ever had but worth trying for sure!My husband got the Huevos rancheros which were solid. Tbh it's a great place with good food but I find the line thing weird both while waiting and while eating. If I were to return, it would absolutely be either super early in the morning or during the week. Would definitely repeat that muffin!!"}, {"review_id": "Y_wFaJjW_NFfoDpQmFGLRQ", "user_id": "ZAwLBDhupiPRvcNr6FKzjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Best breakfast in PVD hands down.

It came with potatoes and toast. The veggie omelet was actually a lot better than I expected. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The omelet was filled with onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, and spinach. I've had plenty of omelets in my life but this one was in the top 3. The eggs were very fluffy, SO SOFT, and melted in my mouth. It had the perfect ratio (50/50) of veggies and eggs, which is something I find ranges where ever you go.Service: This is a unique experience. I would recommend visiting the Kitchen if you have no plans after brunch because you don't know how long you'll be there. It's a one-man-run restaurant so the service is kinda slow. We went on a Friday morning (9:30ish) and we had to wait a little bit + wait again when we were seated (which we didn't mind). Later on, a girl came to fill my coffee, so I guess sometimes he has someone help him out.Environment: The place is adorable and very small. There are cute personalized touches everywhere (the spoon door handle, writing on the door frame, etc). Each table is a little booth (2-4 people) so this isn't a place for large parties of people. The entire place can seat about 14 people, so you'll probably be waiting regardless what time you go.TIP: It's cash only!"}, {"review_id": "gTIEwuV-1Dl9HUtbVHn8vw", "user_id": "4QycmVRNCRoXZ0KyAACR9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/27/2017", "text": "Awesome dining experience!!

The chef comes over, takes your order and cooks it (said restaurant has long since closed sadly). If you don't know what you'd like he'll ask what you're into and give suggestions. Chef certainly knows what he's doing here. As stated by others it's a VERY small place. Came in on Thursday at 10:30am, no wait to sit. The experience takes a while so do not come here if you are in a rush. I had the best three dollar piece of bacon (pork belly I believe) on earth.

The French toast was actually quite big and pretty good compared to the ones I've had before. The bacon is house made/cut and is thick, slightly on the salty side.

I rave about this place to everyone I know. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes to an hour outside (it's worth it!). As other reviewers noted- this place is small. There are only five tables, so I don't recommend coming with more than 4 people. My favorite thing to get is the big shot breakfast with French toast and bacon. The grilled muffin is also a must. And the coffee! The food is always consistently good every time I come here, because the owner, Howard cooks everything himself. The potions are huge and the prices are VERY cheap for what you get. The only downside is this is a cash-only establishment, but that won't stop me from coming here at least once a month."}, {"review_id": "feM4e6gQo0KvpdOxDy_rww", "user_id": "pZ0oB-p4-IsXlYJahsc2CA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I cant tell you how disappointed I was by kitchen.

Overall the experience and the food didn't disappoint. I decided to get the big shot breakfast so i could try a little bit of everything and see what I would like and if everything lived up to the \"hype\". I would like to start with the pros. PROS*CROISSANT FRENCH TOAST. It's a must. No joke. The croissant was light, flakey, crispy and just the right amounts of sweet and savory. Wow. This is the SOLE reason for me to come back. It's amazing no question. Get It and don't look back. *Home Fries-were super yummy. I love freshly grilled red potatoes. They add to the homey feeling and I appreciate the act of grilling instead of a quick run through the fryer.*Atmosphere- This place is downright adorable. Yeah it's small but it just adds to its quaintness. CONS*Bacon- I'll prepare for everyone to shun me now. I really wanted to love it. I really really wanted this to live up to its glorious name, but it fell flat. Don't get me wrong it's sheer size and thickness will blow your mind but as for the taste....it's meh. Too much fat and personally way over salted. Every bite followed a gulp of water. I love bacon and it's sad that I just didn't love this one. *Eggs- They didn't taste bad but they didn't knock my socks off either. They tasted like eggs I would get pretty much anywhere else. So definitely not worth the wait. Synopsis: Not mentioning the wait because it's a small place and a wait is basically inevitable. Deal with it honestly... If you don't want long waits then wouldn't recommend coming here. Food as a whole didn't impress me .. the one standing star was the croissant french toast. I'd come back for that. Without a doubt. Btw its cash only:)"}, {"review_id": "FhbMRyd_-9_WkpVkq_leAw", "user_id": "iLUHw1uN9rQMjyZL1XJxvQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "Do you like delicious filling breakfast food? Do you like small quaint places to eat? Do you like to get breakfast in small groups? Also and this is the biggest question, do you mind waiting in a line for most likely over an hour for all of these things? If you answered YES to all of these questions you need to check out Kitchen. This breakfast spot always hits the spot, but it is a process to eat here. There are no reservations, there is just show up and pray that very few people as yourself woke up that day and felt the need to also wait in line for an awesome breakfast. The wait varies and I mean that it can be 30 minutes or easily over an hour. My only suggestion is to show up as early as you can because the longer into the morning you wait the longer you will be waiting to eat and when people start to get Hangry it can ruin a morning.The place is truly the tiniest place I have ever been in. It's about the size of a shed in someone's backyard. It has five tables (two four seaters and three two seaters), one waitress, and one cook who you can see making each and every item just about two feet away from you which for some reason makes the meal seem like it was made with more TLC. The restaurant usually plays music very softly in the background, so it isn't too loud besides other people's conversations. However, once people get their food, there isn't really any talking happening because everyone is just lost in the food trance of devouring an unbelievable breakfast. The food is always amazing. I have been multiple times and always leave satisfied. I have ordered three meals here. I have ordered the sweet bread French toast, the breakfast quesadilla, and then just pancakes and bacon. All of them are simple and mouth-watering. Furthermore, the bacon is the thickest, juiciest bacon I have ever had in my life. I have never had bacon anywhere like it. It's literally as thick as a piece of steak! Also you have to try the daily muffin, it usually varies each time I go, but it is just the best! So remember be prepared to wait in line. Bring fun people to hang with to pass the time. Don't get crabby because the wait is always worth it!"}, {"review_id": "2sP6J7GEyja48LGqcQaB1w", "user_id": "nlNDDHfu-olKjSvXtW1Qyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "Great food and cool little place.  Worth the wait....highly recommend.  The omelette was spectacular ..go for French style.  Rancheros also wonderful."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/kitchen-providence?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
