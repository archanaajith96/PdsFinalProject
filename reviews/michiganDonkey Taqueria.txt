I ordered the Taco de Panza (seared pork belly ) and the Taco de Borrego (braised lamb). Borrego was more of a mild flavored taco, but the pickled jalapeños gave it the punch it needed. De Panza was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. The only \"negative\" for me with De Panza was that I'm not a fan of onions, and there was a liberal garnish that I got a mouthful of. The guacamole had a nice kick to it and the right amount of tang, which paired with their homemade chips.The danger in trying something new is that you run the risk of not enjoying what you order. I had ordered the Cervezarita (most of the ingredients are sour), in the hopes that it wouldn't be as sour as it was. If you like sour, definitely get this! However, my amigas ordered the prickly pear margaritas and that was refreshing and not too sweet.Overall, enjoyed th experience"}, {"review_id": "yUboay1icnkq0_Ra6RTS-A", "user_id": "Pr1ejVzS7ADZzUliZq9J5A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "The food quality is 8/10 and the margarita are 10/10.  But this place is just too overpriced for me to approve of it. They charge $3 for tortilla chips in addition to the charge for dip or guacamole!! Are you kidding me?!?  At $10+ per margarita I don't think they really need to be charging for chips.  The tacos are great, but not the best I've had in Grand Rapids. The best tacos I've had in Grand Rapids would have to be Taqueria San Jose or Tacos El Cunado. The reason to go here would be the classy ambiance and cool patio. But for upscale ambiance serving Mexican food, I prefer Luna in downtown GR."}, {"review_id": "fnSMvJ1OBVqSfYg6eX4fDw", "user_id": "aQSJRNDMUzGMT-pf_MWaqQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "DAMN SHAME!It disappointments me to write this review as they are so close to being 5 Stars.My issue with Hipster joints no matter what the cuisine is the training the front staff gets to just say \"No\" to easy requests.I drink 2-4 shots of Sipping Tequila, but I like them (Don Julio 1942, Herruda Anejo, Siete Leguas, and Clase Azule to name a few or $60-$70 just in Tequila) with Orange slices vs lime......and even though I saw 10 oranges that cost about $0.65 cents a piece I was told I could NOT get them with my tequila shots.I also asked if I could order Pico de gallo with my chips and salsa that cost 3 bucks and again even though they had tomatoes, red onion, garlic, cilantro, and lime juice already diced and ready to assemble in there guacamole again the answer was \"NO\" can't get that......how trains these people.....the Manger has spent the last two hours texting on her phone and from the staff grumbling giving negative feedback on their performance...all I can say is the restaurant lost an easy $50 in sheer profit, got a negative review on Yelp and has a staff \"stuck\" there to make rent."}, {"review_id": "RYYVVKprhdzJr2hcuURZlA", "user_id": "SkcKsBHLmzFMuARhgt37Vg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "We stopped in at Donkey Taqueria without reservations on New Years Eve and walked right up to the bar for dinner. It is a cozy, warm environment, friendly and knowledgable staff. Gluten free options but not marked on the menu. GF bloody mary's with McClures! WOOT! Yet, the bartender we had knew exactly what tacos we could order. And then she humbly corrected herself on one taco she identified as GF. Margaritas are served in rocks glasses and go down fast. They are delicious! Great options for all taste buds - spicy, sweet, or status-quo original marg taste. The tequila menu is vast and must be explored over time. Do!We had all three gluten free tacos available. They accommodated appetizer dips with tostada rounds because their tortilla chips are homemade with flour. Homemade, People!Booth, low, and high-top wood seating and dim-lit on the evening we arrived at 7pm. It's cozy because it's 'tight' quarters and can be loud when full. They have a patio. Off-street parking may require a walk over a few blocks."}, {"review_id": "mCdx08DkcjmzMFgZpXEMbw", "user_id": "ncAOj5Xz-XS6bpSnTWp3tQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/1/2018", "text": "I asked our server if Donkey Taqueria if the best Mexican in Grand Rapids was here. He looked at me like I was an idiot and replied, \"Uh, yes. Obviously.\" After tasting for myself, I agree with him.Donkey Taqueria is in the heart of Wealthy Street, an area increasing becoming more hipster as coffee shops, cloth stores, and other restaurants move in. Across the street from the Winchester on a corner, Donkey Taqueria is hard to miss. It's one medium sized room with a long bar off to the left side as you walk in. It's decorated with small hanging lights and brick exposed walls. Take a seat at one of the many types of tables there and your server will get to you...eventually. Like all Grand Rapids restaurants we've experienced, service is SLOW compared to other cities. They take their time in greeting you, getting you water, taking your order, and bringing you the check. If you're in a rush and hungry, I say get on the quickest flight out.If you have some time, stay at Donkey Taqueria for Grand Rapid's best Mexican. Note I said best in Grand Rapids, a historically Dutch city. For Grand Rapids, it's GREAT. Is it on the same level as LA, NYC, Austin, or even Washington, DC? No. Regardless, it's still good. They only have corn tortillas, but it adds to the types of tacos they make. I ordered the taco de pavo en mole, which was fine, but the real stand out was their veggie taco, taco de ejotes. Those fried green beans really add to the flavor combo.Their queso and chips is good and any marg you order will be good. I ordered the prickly pear and my wife ordered the standard one. We were both pleased.If you have time, stop by and enjoy good tacos and good times at Donkey Taqueria."}, {"review_id": "dHAbFCRlH9yoKUTwRR_Eww", "user_id": "f0d03Xikk6GcreLH9nHGdA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Donkey is one of our go-to spots when we want tacos and margaritas.

But it's still really good.Guacamole is overpriced.I think they should serve \"free\" chips or tortillas. This is a common practice in fine Mexican restaurants. It ultimately is built into the prices on the menu, so I don't see why they wouldn't add this \"perceived value\" from a business point of view. But I won't dock them for it.They have a nice outdoor waiting area for guests waiting for seating. You can order drinks while you wait.

The food is exceptional and I have never had bad service.I have been here too many times for me to admit, and have had most items on their menu although some change by season.Apps:My favorite is their guacamole- it's fresh and full of flavor. Their queso is also velvety and delicious, everything it should be. I have had their queso fundido with chorizo and much prefer the above two. It's good, but overly rich and I find it lacks a bit of seasoning. It also has more of the stringy cheese thing going on as opposed to a melted cheese sauce. Their refried beans are decent. Both of their refried beans are decent, but between those and the guacamole or queso the latter two would win out for me every time.Tacos:I have had every taco on their current menu (no shame) and my current favorite is the panza (pork belly) taco. It's spicy, meaty, and satisfying. They used to have fried brussels sprout taco (currently replaced with a fried green bean taco which to me is average, if that) and if it is a special GET IT. By far the best taco I have ever had, and if you don't like brussels sprouts this taco would turn you. Honorable mention on their taco list are the turkey mole and pescado. I only do not like one of their tacos- the potato one, and find it lacks flavor.Other:Their tortas are amazing. I have had the ones on the menu (the Torta de Jamon is my personal favorite) and their special ones they have on Tuesday's and have never been disappointed. They are plenty enough to eat as a meal for one without a side.I have never had a bad experience here. I really like the atmosphere, especially when it's warm enough to enjoy the outdoor seating area, and food. It is more expensive than your typical Mexican restaurant, but the originality and quality is worth it."}, {"review_id": "5-W1fs-jkDKi0yp6t5ZHFw", "user_id": "20lQTJAyJOlWVkp5d42sLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/19/2017", "text": "This place is all about being hip, which is probably why they juiced up prices within the past year. I'd only go here when it's nice out, so you can at least wait outside with their bar that has slightly overpriced margs/sangria/beer. If you're on the super cheap end, they sell Hamm's inside. A bowl of chips that taste out of a big costs 3 bucks. A thing of guac is 5. Chips and guac is 8... But this place is all about tacos and feel. It's a nice, laid back vibe that should be enjoyed outdoors. The tacos have a thicker corn tortilla that doesn't fall apart. Choose your favorite taco option or any of the tortas. Some people love it. Some people are OK with it. And some people aren't hip enough to get the DNKY shirts. I'd assume my rating would be lower if I ate inside, but I'm a sucker for outdoor eating."}, {"review_id": "1YxaXXkgf7zLcV4WZtOfMQ", "user_id": "wcxjbSQICNwBnRh-BGchww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Best tacos in town.

My wife and I visited Donkeys a year ago because of the yelp reviews. We were throughly disappointed. The tacos and tortas are fine nothing special. It was sad because we were expecting and hoping for me. The drinks were alright although slightly pricy. Fast forward a year later, we move to Fulton's and decide to give it another go. It could have been a bad night or a bad chef. We wait for an hour and again order drinks. The drinks are expensive but we knew that. Again nothing that's wow. I like tacos and my wife is partial to tortas. Oh boy! What a waste of time and money. We were really hoping that this time around it will be better but it seems like we were right the first time. Thankfully we have found El Cuniado at Bridge Street to satisfy our craving for Mexican food. They are not fancy and you will not find expensive drinks or places to sit but the food is amazing.

You literally feel it burning your throat as it goes down -- yowza! -- amazing stuff! My husband and I started off with chips and guacamole, as always. They are generous with the cilantro and the avocados are a perfect blend of chunky and smooth. A large portion is only $8 and we couldn't even finish it because our food came out within minutes! I've been here about 7 times and their service and food is always freaky fast! I ordered my usual--fish tacos and a pork/pineapple taco. Each taco was $4. The orange chipotle mayo drizzle really makes the fish taco. I always wish there was more pineapple on the pork taco but that's just me! Their tacos are so hefty and loaded up with toppings that it's really worth the $4!Can't wait to come back in the summer to sit on the patio & have a margarita with our doggy! :P"}, {"review_id": "2xsI5tZ030N6x-sCoc4iRg", "user_id": "3XT_xWbKl-6V9EVPaa1JJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "Came here with 3 girlfriends on a Tuesday night - surprised how busy it was!
