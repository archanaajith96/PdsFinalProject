The intimate location. They moved and this place is much louder and much more crowded. This was a purposeful decision by the owners. The desire to democratize the restaurant and make more people feel comfortable coming; check out an interview with them online about it.  So, this means that most of the pics and reviews on Yelp are of the old place. You've been warned - don't go expecting a romantic time.The short review of Novel is that it's way over priced, the new location sucks, the serving sizes are way too small, and it's pretentious. Avoid.The longer review is we walked in and immediately knew we made a mistake. We were trying to celebrate something and we could barely hear ourselves talk. The too tight seating arrangement feels like a quick lunch spot. If the goal was to make a large group of people feel comfortable coming out to loudly drink, well done. For everyone else, nope. I then knew we were in trouble when I tried to order drinks and an appetizer, and were told the cooks prefer to have the whole meal ordered at once *eyeroll* But, I was like, ok great, we'll quickly decide. They want to time our meal properly. I'm down with that!  So we ordered.... And waited.... And waited ... It took an hour to get the entrees. And by the time we did, half the tables had cleared out because we purposefully came after the typical dinner rush. I have no idea why it took so long. Any positives, you ask? They seemed pretty accommodating to food allergies, gluten free options, etc. Kudos for that.So, let's talk about what did come. First, the wine pours were small and done by the wait staff. I never like this; bartenders are trained how to pour and how to do so consistently. Waiters usually aren't and ours wasn't. To watch $12 disappear on a stingy pour is obnoxious. Additionally, they didn't change or even ask to change out the glasses. Come on! Not at this level of dining.  Do you know what they did do though?  Ask me multiple times if I wanted more wine as we waited. Before my glass was empty. No, I don't want wine, I want my food I ordered an hour ago. Are you trying to get me drunk?  When the first food arrived, the calamari appetizer was tasty, no doubt. I liked the peppers with the fish. Things were looking up. I was relieved. I shouldn't have been.When our entrees arrived, no joke, we both laughed out loud. My date ordered a pasta dish and it came with 10 pieces of actual pasta. My scallop dish came out with... Wait for it.... 3 scallops. And this was an entree. For $30. And nothing else. No vegetables, carbs, nothing. Is the market value of a single scallop $10? I hadn't heard. Or, are you trying to rip off people because you think no one is going to complain (full disclosure, I didn't complain. I hate making scenes but I probably should have said something). Now I get what small plate dining is. I've done it multiple times and know what to expect both quantity and price wise.  This restaurant's entree section needs to be renamed, reduced in price, and/or those dishes need some robust sides. You can decide for yourself.  I've attached a pic. It took us 5 minutes to finish both dishes.Listen, I make decent cash. And I like going out. But I know pretentious yuppie when I see it - I'm from NYC. This place has a lot of balls. I don't want to eat out in KC and drop $130 for what ended up being 4 glasses of wine and essentially 3 appetizers. Neither myself nor my date had any mouth orgasms (food was good, not great), the ambience sucked, and the prices and serving sizes were unacceptable. They are also very purposefully making up for their old location by cramming as many people into here as possible to make $. It's a dick move.Avoid until they find out what they want to be and what sort of patrons they want to have. This restaurant epitomizes the massive class problem in America. If this is fine dining now, I'm out. My money is worth more than this."}, {"review_id": "tgVB5rMWcco29rx3Sqovxw", "user_id": "jNuBCiVTd9R-BVNv_-HxQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Don't let the historic house appearance on the outside fool you. Once you go inside, you will be amazed at the ambiance of the place. Dim, cozy and romantic with lit candles. And once you have a taste of their food, you can see why they're one o the top rated restaurant in Kansas City. The rave review don't lie. Our girls night out, we each order a separate appetizer; Crispy Egg, Duck Neck Dumplings, and Roasted Beet Salad. And out of the three appetizer (granted they were all delicious) but by far my favorite would have to be the duck neck dumplings. When I think of anything that is duck neck, chicken neck - I think of it being more bones, less meat. But boy, was I surprise. It was totally not the case here. The duck neck was all meat - softy and juicy in your mouth. And by the time we finished our appetizer, we were in fear of being in food heaven with our entrees. We thought about each trying a different entree but that Seared Scallops won us over. And true to our fear, we did end up in food heaven. The Seared Diver Scallop with beef tendon, mushroom and sweet potato was, what this generation say - LIT, on FIRE! The plating for the scallop was beautiful like a piece of art but alas, it must go into my stomach. Seared in perfection - soft in texture and taste, not mushy at all.After the entree, do not end the night without having their dessert. If you do, *tears* we just can't be friend, lol. Definitely try their Passionfruit Panna Cotta with blood orange and crumble pieces of sesame brittle even if you are full. I'm sure one bite won't blow up the stomach and who knows, you might just end up finishing the entire dessert. This dessert was amazing. Just a perfect combo blend of taste and balance of sweetness.. Creamy custard-like texture (like that of a creme brulee) with the sweet taste of the blood orange and crunchy sesame brittle. Honestly if I can borrow the chef, I would like to borrow him just to make this every night (maybe every night is a bit much, every two-three night)? Overall, this place is truly a hidden gem in Kansas City. A perfect place to have a fancy dinner with friends, a romantic date with your significant others. Give it a try and make sure to let the chef knows how wonderful the meals are. It's definitely a Michelin star rated restaurant in my book."}, {"review_id": "OQdM5R8dol0ORVv6yd67pw", "user_id": "c4RENapN7ZZrTYGR94zNig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "For a truly novel experience, look no further.Now that we've got that pun out of the way....Really, the star ratings for Novel on Yelp speak for itself (4.5 stars, 230+ reviews at post time).  Novel is a unique fusion of classy, cultured, and romantic--while staying humble and subtle in its own right--setting itself up for one hell of a dining experience.  Novel is set inside a beautifully renovated home just on the western outskirts of downtown.  Make sure you check the pictures here on Yelp, otherwise you'll drive right by the restaurant without knowing it!ATMOSPHERE: Quaint and old-fashioned, yet rustic and intimate.  It can feel a bit crammed, especially upstairs in the small dining area, but they play background music just loud enough to where eavesdropping and hearing thy neighbors really isn't an issue.  Be ready to seal your lips in between songs, though.DRINKS: They've got a small list of speciality cocktails, with each cocktail covering a major liquor group.  Only problem is, there's only one cocktail per liquor group (I'm sure they won't mind making to order, though). Luckily for you, they've got beer available and an impressive wine menu. Their gin cocktail is good, but their vodka/raspberry drank is even better.APPETIZERS: 1) DUCK NECK DUMPLINGS: Easily a top 5 appetizer I've ever had.  I wish they made this into a full entree, so I can eat as many duck dumplings to my heart's content.  Seriously.  Chinese-esque roast duck wrapped in delicious dumpling.  My only gripe is the dumplings and portion sizes are too small!2) CHILLED CORN SOUP: Delicious.  A creamy, thick corn broth, with a cold twist.  Very good, but heavy on the cream, so it's very sweet.  The lobster mixed in there is a great touch.ENTREES:1) BEEF TENDERLOIN: They recommend getting it cooked medium-rare, so even if you don't like your meat moo-ing at you, just keep your mouth shut and nod--it's that good, and that much worth it.  The bone marrow on the side sounds weird, but it's really good- think of it as the well-done piece of cow you didn't get. The potatoes and veggies are standard, and they throw in some potato chips as an odd but creative topping as well.2) DUROC PORK CHOP: My girlfriend got this, so I can't speak for her- but upon trying it, it's delicious.  Much more of a \"pure\" pork chop with less seasoning and marinated flavors, and more of a natural pork flavor.  Note: this thing is huge.  Expect a take-home box at the end of the night if you're getting this.TL;DR: Novel is as good as it gets.  It opts for subtlety and mastery of craft over flashy and bombastic.  From its atmosphere, to its setting, to its impeccably delicious food, Novel embodies all of these wonderful traits, and more. It's a true dining experience that makes your visit more memorable than the others.  Without a doubt, Novel receives my highest recommendation."}, {"review_id": "w34rO0RCqyR8ZZM_srERhA", "user_id": "z6CJG99mAxIKQMT655PK0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "Easily one of the best fine dining restaurants I've ever been to.

In my opinion, this place is overhyped. However, I'll be the first to admit that I don't understand certain aspects of the culinary world so I plead ignorance on this one. Excuse me while I rant now. Why can a upscale restaurant add tripe (cow stomach) to their menu and get rave reviews about it? Tripe is by no means considered a refined food or delicacy. In fact, it is considered pet food in areas of the world. In others, it is sold by street vendors for practically nothing. But once people spend $$$ for it, it becomes delicious? I don't buy it. It is a rubbery, tasteless, odd looking and glandular tissue that I hope to never pay for again.Even if the tripe wasn't part of the menu, I still wouldn't recommend this place to a friend.

When making a reservation of 5 or more people a credit card will need to be held, if you don't cancel and your party does it show up $20/person will be charged. They do this because space is limited and they're always booked. 3. The portions and menu are set up for you to try appetizer, meal, and dessert. 4. You will not be full if you bypass the appetizer, (I'm a fairly small girl who never finishes a meal and always has to take home leftovers)... I finished my appetizer AND my meal and was not overly stuffed. 5. The best part: they offer free bread and butter!!!6. We did not order wine but they offer a vast selection and knowledgeable staff. We ordered several items between my party of four: the goat cheese gnocchi was one of the top favorites. The duroc pork chop was amazing, the topping was even better than the actual pork chop.

There are 7-8 starters and it was insanely difficult to decide between them - I will be returning to try them all. For my main course I ordered the halibut and my boyfriend ordered a steak. Both were very tasty and prepared well. We shared a side of potatoes and unfortunately did not leave room for dessert. I love the coursing of this restaurant, each plate was carefully crafted and served appropriately.

Highly recommend.- Crispy Egg: Fiancé said that he has never had anything like it - in a good way.- Duroc pork chop: It was so tender. My only gripe was that the pork belly ragu was a little too salty for my taste. I ended up giving the rest of it to my fiancé.- Goat Cheese Gnocchi: This was my fiancé's main entrée. I'm not a fan of goat cheese because of the funky taste, but this made me forget that I don't like it.- \"Not Your Regular Carrot Cake\": This was essentially a parsnip cake, and it was so delicious. I could have eaten a whole cake by myself. I believe this is a seasonal item, so they may not have it when you go, but I'm sure their other desserts are fantastic. Don't skip the dessert!

Granted, their real estate is fairly limited because it is in a converted house.

Starting with the food, 90% of the items that  we ordered were cooked to perfection with tons of flavor and really inventive combinations of ingredients! My favorite items that we tried were: 1) the duck neck dumplings, 2) the celeriac & crab soup, 3) the hamachi crudo, 4) the fresh peas and Parmesan, and 4) the seared diver scallops with bone marrow and a sweet potato sauce. I think the scallop and bone marrow dish may have been one of the best fine dining dishes I have had the pleasure of trying in Kansas City (the scallops were seated perfectly and cooked just right). I only have one gripe with the food & that is the fish we ordered. The piece we received contained at least  1/2 of a blood line-and these are pieces that the chefs should have taken out prior to cooking and serving the piece of fish. That being said, the server who took care of us & was incredibly professional about the situation (I did complain) & she comped the item! I give the service here an A+, the service staff knows all about the seasonally changing menu and behave in a kind and skillful manner.I also give the ambiance here an A+, located in an old, large, & refurbished mansion in the west side of KC, right off Summit Street. The lighting is perfectly dim & the old wood interior probably makes the food taste even better!  I hope this restaurant experiences continued success because they clearly have a talented head chef at the helm! I would recommend trying Novel if you not yet been & I will be back sometime soon! p.s.

A simple verbal acknowledgement would be enough. Whatever it is, we're low key about those kind of things, but I like this kind of service where they reach out. Shows they care.We arrived and were greeted, seated and served bread that appeared to come from around the corner at Fervere. No criticism if that's the case. Probably the best bread in town in my opinion. The butter was salted and served room temperature. Everything is on track, so far.Starters included Melon Salad with lemongrass, green papaya, black sesame for my wife, I chose Duck Neck Dumplings with foie gras,white turnip, pickled cherry. We both found the watermelon sub-par, pink and white, picked too early and lacking in taste. The cantaloupe, somewhat better suffered from the same. The lemongrass was a nice touch but the black sesame sauce was broken, didn't adhere well to the ingredients and tasted like ground, canned Spanish peanuts. This is supposed to be fine dining so I question why a dish with marginal ingredients would be served. The greens that came with each were limp and seemed to be over-saturated with too much vinaigrette or had simply set too long. Not appetizing. But wait, what is that occasional stinging bite on the melon salad? That can't be raw crushed garlic can it? I can't be sure. Intentional, or someone doing sloppy prep nearby splashing the ingredients?The dumplings were seasoned properly but unremarkable. I love foie gras so have to question, where was it? I couldn't taste it. If you pay for such a pricey delicacy you should be able to taste it. There was nothing interesting going on with the pickled cherry.Entrees included the scallops for my wife and beef tenderloin for myself, medium rare, and it was presented as such and looked right. As a rule I love to brine chicken and pork at home but a quality cut of beef, leave be. Let the ingredient shine. And I've had brined steaks in restaurants I've enjoyed, but this was clobbered beyond recognition, far too much sodium leaving the steak as chewy, over-salted meat. In addition, the meat was tougher than expected making me question the preparation. The hash brown was equally over salted in my opinion, this from a guy that loves salt. The scallops were presented at a consistency we anticipated but there was little in the way of seasoning or a sauce to make them interesting. My wife's favorite dish, scallops, she did not make mention of them at dinner.We selected wine by the glass as one of us was going to have to drive back to Lawrence. Only four reds are available by the glass. With such an expansive wine list it's too bad they can't provide a few more. Still, we ended up ordering a second glass so maybe should have stuck with a bottle.At novel you order all at once, so not knowing the size of portions which by the time appetizers arrived we noticed were larger than usual for fine dining, we found the two vegetables accompaniments we ordered--the potatoes and the cauliflower-- total overkill and inconsistent for what a restaurant charging these prices should serve. 90% of both went home as carryout. They were both unremarkable except for the smoked raisins found in the cauliflower which at least made the taste interesting. We took them home and my evaluation the following day stood, including a good sized chunk of the beef tenderloin which was still a harsh blast of sodium. If I wanted these kind of quantities I could have gone to Cracker Barrel or Buca di Beppo--ate at both once, never again.Dessert was a blueberry hand pie with lemon ice cream. There are lots of ways to make ice cream overkill or just too far over the top. Somehow the single scoop was beyond bland and uninteresting, with the corn cookie crumble added little. I can't be sure by my guess is the berries came from a can. We came here to celebrate a very special evening together and left bitterly disappointed for what was probably the most anticipated meal in a year. Angry? Beyond.On a Saturday night I found myself out $200 with tip, a box full of food I didn't care for to take home, all the while sitting in a restaurant half empty the entire service. I have to wonder what the hell is going on here or if it was just a really, really bad night. From this point forward it matters not, but if this happens often, word will get around. Or maybe it already has.Never did find out what they do with that question about what you're celebrating. We came and left without it mentioned, further evidence that on our visit, attention to detail in what is supposed to be fine dining took a holiday at our expense."}, {"review_id": "VbQ13pFVUpbv7hEDn1Fang", "user_id": "_Ri8TCDNVbVZ1LNVJqmw_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Novel has been one of our favorite restaurants for years, due to the beautiful, intimate setting, the warm, helpful staff, and of course, Ryan's creative and delicious food.  Not to mention Jessica's exceptional desserts, and their excellent wine selections.  So we were a little worried about their move to a new location.  We dined at their new Crossroads restaurant on Friday, their opening night.We were not disappointed.  The new place is different, of course, but it is still a beautiful and comfortable place.  The large bar at the front is attractive, and sits in front of large windows.  The dining room is lit with soft globes suspended from the ceiling, and there are long curtains that soften the hard surfaces and add a some elegance.  The open kitchen is energetic and attractive, but not a distraction.  The best thing, however, is that Ryan's food is better than ever!  The new, larger menu features a pasta section that really shines.  The tagliatelle with white Bolognese sauce is unbelievably delicious.  The halibut was also memorable.  Jessica's Raspberry Chiffon Cake almost made me cry.  Can't wait to go back and try many other new things on the menu.  This will remain one of our favorite places for a great meal."}, {"review_id": "F80WmQiCtJxiQhINcyCANA", "user_id": "MR6VjFeF61iYnaIcHwMRvg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "I had been wanting to go to novel for a while and left very underwhelmed. For me, it just didn't live up to the hype. I had the pork chop and it was extremely fatty and undercooked. I also had the passion fruit panna cotta, it was good, but nothing to write home about. My friend had the scallops, duck neck dumplings, and chocolate toffee cake. I tried bites of all of hers and just wasn't impressed. For the price, there are definitely better places in the city to eat"}, {"review_id": "MyJPQfSR2porQDnnjbz5EQ", "user_id": "HtTULraJCT5tGFjGOQkUHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/6/2016", "text": "Yessssss yes yes yes. Exactly what I thought novel would be. Delicious. Comfortable. Unique. Our server was kind and happy and accommodating. The house is so beautiful. The crispy egg is good, the pork toast is amazing. ( I think the pork toast should be made into an entree) The scallops are wonderful. The pork entree is so so tasty (wasn't super fond of the pork belly that came with it?) the drinks were great and consistently came out quickly. I had a great time and I hope to be back soon!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/novel-restaurant-kansas-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
