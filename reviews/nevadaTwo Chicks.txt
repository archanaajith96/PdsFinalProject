I'm really glad we did as the food was excellent! The restaurant was pretty busy but we were seated quickly. I had the biscuits and gravy combo. I highly recommend that if you like biscuits and gravy. They have a very good sausage gravy. The only criticism I can make is there was misunderstanding with the server. My son wanted a breakfast sandwich (think a sausage McMuffin with no egg). It's not on their menu but we ordered the dishes a la carte. Our server misunderstood and just brought him two sausage patties. She fixed the mistake and all was well. Make this a pit stop for breakfast or lunch when you are in the Reno area!"}, {"review_id": "tQgJNRlTBD_2TSEHEpmyGw", "user_id": "2M9x32qsgPawuEFMgDRY8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Went here with my husband and two kiddos for brunch on a Tuesday and although it was \"seat yourself\", we had to wait about 10 minutes for a low top table. They had 2 high top tables for 4, but I don't trust my 4 year old to not fall off the bar stool. It was about 11:30am and the waiting was no issue. The restaurant had colored pencils and kids menus to keep them occupied. Asked the waitress for recommendations as this was our first visit. She happily recommended the breakfast burrito, eggs Benedict and sourdough pancakes. The adults ended up getting the breakfast burritos, which came with hashbrowns. The burrito was the perfect size and the inside mix of eggs, sausage, pico de Gallo and hatch Chile's was so deelish. The top was covered with a cream sauce and guacamole. Highly recommend the burrito. My girls split the 2 pancake combo with the sourdough pancakes, which came with eggs and ham. We also ordered an extra side of hash browns per my daughter's request. The pancakes were light and fluffy. Definitely will get these for myself next time. They also offered sweet potatoe gluten free pancakes as an option. The parking is a little tight but there's plenty of nearby street parking. Try this out if you are in midtown. You won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "Kyvl_JXmY6rwmAWBos1i7A", "user_id": "jLp0HGFcNF6yTUGAVd9W8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "One of the two hot chicks came and greeted us at the counter where I had some of the best eggs around!Duck eggs and crispy hash brown.  Yolk is dense and decadent.My son had biscuit and gravy.  Felt like a old style breakfast joint found in small towns, thick and full of little bacon bits.  No heart attack's so far..."}, {"review_id": "tntHlFWeGw17jzE_JpUpHw", "user_id": "z4RpPl09kAzkSD6y2ZQnDA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "I had Two Chicks bookmarked for quite some time and couldn't wait to try it on my most recent trip to Reno. We stopped by on a Saturday morning, and managed to come just early enough to beat the usual brunch crowd. I was trying to be \"healthy\" and opted for their Two Ingredient Pancake combo. The \"pancakes\" were gluten and grain-free, made from sweet potatoes. They didn't hold up well and fell apart easily, but if you have dietary restrictions or are just trying to eat healthier, they provide a nice option. The combination came with eggs and either bacon or sausage. I opted for sausage and scrambled eggs.I think this place would have been a home-run if I had ordered something different and hadn't tried to be \"healthy\". Because let me tell you, the REAL pancakes looked amazing."}, {"review_id": "HxgMV94UcNesvY0oPB4rcQ", "user_id": "ng15Bty1Xh_NjessNvJrdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Yes, there's usually a bit of a wait for Sunday/Saturday brunch, but they give you one of those alert coasters that still reaches as far as the two cute boutiques (Nomad and Sierra Belle) that are just across the way. Besides, if you don't want to venture outside, get cozy with fellow hungry peeps. Grab the R&R, a cup of their fantastic coffee(if you're lucky, you'll find a full pot), lean against your neighbor and breathe a Sunday sigh of relax.  In with the good(fresh coffee smell) out with the bad(the work week's woes) and in no time you'll hear \"You, table for...\"Okay now let's talk about why it's worth the wait. Best Eggs Benny in town!! Not to mention, I love their twist on the tradish grilled potatoes: grilled sweet potatoes with poblano pepper that gives you just a little kick. Plus, they offer many more delicious egg options, the Harvest Omelette being one of my favs! And did I mention their rich,caramel, hot cup-o- joe? Oh yeah... I did... when we were waiting for a table.  Hope you enjoyed your morning at Two Chicks, and if not, plan to this weekend!"}, {"review_id": "ayEpFjZP08HqBSeXWRTURw", "user_id": "N8YiJ8NTaVG_qAenWokJmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Seriously impressive breakfast foods with cute decor!

Came in a little after 8am and the place was busy but I was able to get a table for myself. I travel a lot for work therefore am usually alone when I go to new cities and enjoying searching Yelp to help me find a place I might enjoy. That is what I did this morning. What caught my attention was the \"Wood flamed\" coffee that they serve that is specific to them, I am a HUGE fan of coffee and let me just say, this blend is AMAZING! I would come back just for the coffee BUT there are more great things to say about this place. The staff, super fun and friendly. My server Bree opened up to me and expressed her favorites since I had asked what was good here and she took her time and didn't rush, also answered the questions I had Now for the food, looked great, good size portions (couldn't finish it all) and the taste was good. I didn't like the choices of omelets on the menu but I was able to create my own with bacon, onion, cheese and avocado so that was nice! I ordered a side of apple cinnamon French toast instead of regular toast but was kinda let down by the flavor, there really wasn't any that was different from regular French toast in my opinion but it was still good. Hope this review helps anyone who is lookin for a good breakfast place! Definitely worth a shot for sure Jess"}, {"review_id": "Q31sfvwv6ji1rqdZXEX-pw", "user_id": "tq8AyiMYKVxPmajViExKKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "I really love this place.  The staff is always so wonderful, the ambience is cute, but most importantly is the great food.My daughter and I usually come on the weekday mornings because as we have learned the weekends can be quite a nit of a wait.My  always likes to try something new.  Today she had the harvest omelette. Hi today I ate at two chicks the harvest omelette it was so...

Every time I come to Reno this is a must stop for us! Sometimes the wait for a table is kinda Cray Cray BUT the food is 'egg-ceptional'!!!! Seriously! Staff is super friendly and upbeat! Atmosphere is a fun vibe. All things eggs!!Veggie Benedict is amazing! So filling with fresh ingredients. Eggs cooked perfectly! Sauteed onions were lightly caramelized, avocado was ripe. English muffin was lightly buttered and toasted. Hashbrown portions are huge! I was absolutely satisfied. Presentation was eye pleasing. Even the plate is shaped like an egg! Hubby had the steak patty w/Eggs. Patty cooked to medium well as he wanted, scrambled eggs and added Jack cheese. He was happy with portion size and presentation. Earned yet another clean plate sticker lol!! Coffee is black! It will surly 'wake yo a$$ up' !! Creams and sugars on tables. I went with a grapefruit mimosa.

The hubs and I eat here pretty regularly because itsjustsogood. I love love love that they serve local ingredients and they offer duck eggs as an option for an extra charge. If you've never had a duck egg, order it fried and you'll taste the difference between it and a regular egg... duck eggs are so much creamer and more rich in flavor. You'll never want to go back to regular eggs again. I order the eggs benny with duck eggs and sweet potatoes every.single.time. I always entertain the option of ordering an alternate item and want to SO badly but I just can't seem to get past the eggs benny. The hubs mixes it up a bit with the red chick scramble, pancakes, sandwiches, and such. Honestly, everything is really good. Cocktails are a must when you're here. They have mimosas, bloodys, seasonal drinks, and more. Coffee is good and comes in a full size mug--none of those mini-diner mugs that require a refill every time you take two sips. Also their homemade whipped butter is so good I can hardly stand it! They change the flavors often so expect to try a different one with each visit. The honey cinnamon one is my fav, but the strawberry one is so good too.  Everyone who works here is nice but they do get busy so they don't always have time to chat. Before moving to Reno we made a visit to Reno for research purposes and found Two Chicks. We ate there three days in a row. When we found out that Red Chick had grown up in Reno we asked her a bunch of questions about the area. She was so sweet and helpful, and I couldn't believe her willingness to share her time with us. The atmosphere is darling--modern style diner with farm style decor and bright colors. You feel happy just walking in there! They also sell cute t-shirts, one of which reads \"Coffee before Talky\" and has become a household phrase. I keep waiting for a woman's x-small or small to come in stock!"}, {"review_id": "bur8Yih0rQKItUnl6ogEPw", "user_id": "AJUa7k0M0SR7pi4eEgaFMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/26/2017", "text": "Came to this cozy breakfast spot on our way out of town. I will say the food variety is interesting. I love that they offer duck egg-when available, so much more rich in taste than chicken eggs.I ordered the Chorizo plate, not knowing that it wasn't like the Chorizo I'm use to. I think this kind was American style& I'm normally use to Portuguese or Mexican style. It tasted more like plain sausage to me so I was a bit disappointed. I decided to order the Bloody Mary, and it was probably the best Bloody I've ever had in my life. Perfect amount of spice, and super flavorful.

Line was out the door by the time we finished our meal!Lots of eggy goodness on the menu but there's other options as well like biscuits and gravy, French toast, and hot cereal. I love that they have grain-free choices for those who are looking for something gluten free!I ordered the Eggs Benedict, but substituted the English muffin for a veggie fritter base. It's such a creative (and healthy!) twist on the traditional eggs bene. My poached eggs were cooked perfectly- cutting them open and seeing the liquid gold yolk pouring out felt almost spiritual. I'm a big fan of their hollandaise, which is so creamy yet light. Also love the thick cut ham they use.My friend got the Harvest Omelette and said it was good. The toast comes with homemade fruity compound butter. Strawberry was today's flavor and I can say it's quite tasty!With the amount of creative menu choices and sides, Two Chicks isn't your average breakfast spot.  Even the interior is expressive with a yellow and red farmhouse feel. Perfect portion sizes.
