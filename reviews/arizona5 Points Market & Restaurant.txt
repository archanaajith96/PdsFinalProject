They have an amazing menu changing based on availability and  the season. Every dish that I have had here so far has been a high quality meal. The coffee here is flavorful and they make sure that it's not empty.The salmon Benedict has been a go to of mine. The hollandaise sauce is not over done and it is just right, making the experience pleasurable rather than messy. The salad that comes with it is probably the best salad I've had in town. Pies are always available and they are a perfect compliment to their coffee that they serve. There is also a market in the back featuring various items and some of the ingredients used on their menu.Food with a cause, more than a sustainable food menu, there is also a strong social justice message. The ambiance is apparent that this establishment supports causes that are important in the current political environment which pertain to social justice. This could be a positive or a negative for some customers, I wouldn't let it get in the way of the one universal, delicious quality food.Again, that coffee is worth every drop, and it keeps me coming back. This place is perfect for any breakfast occasion just make sure to show up early as this place can get pack depending on the day."}, {"review_id": "P9ugOcJiHn-SicnW1BBuvA", "user_id": "tSoqvTHmEjOfArqxCEZO8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "What a great treat in Tucson! Born and raised I'm surprised that I've never gone!The wait was very long, but for good reason! The food was interesting and yummy! The forbidden rice pudding was semi sweet and the vegan sausage was great in the egg sandwich!! Yummy! Next time I'll have to try a pastry while I'm waiting- they looked so good. The reason why I didn't give five stars was because of the service. The host was so kind and full of smiles, yet our server was a little unprofessional (\"what's up? You ready to order?\") Hmmm. Maybe a bad day for him?We will for sure be back!"}, {"review_id": "4Wm8V35e15vO5PqZEZUbCA", "user_id": "lSn7n2Qrq4uDADhMCM_b5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "On a recent eating tour of Tucson ....J/K, we went to visit friends, and see if Tucson was a possible place to move to and based on the food at Five Points, we would move in a heartbeat. Our friends shared the huevos rancheros and forbidden rice, I had the huevos as well, and the husband had the arugula salad. The huevos was an \"11\" on a ten-point scale. Eggs cooked perfectly, great corn tortillas, and the spice of the (home made, not from a can) red sauce was balanced by the avocado.  I didn't hear any complaints or anything from the husband as he devoured the arugula. The whipped goat cheese was a beautiful counter balance to the zest of the peppery green of his salad. The forbidden rice was wonderfully creamy, with added texture added by the cashews. The only down-note was that the rose petal lemonade was more rose forward than lemon, but it was still bubbly and refreshing. The service is efficient and friendly, the decor is hip. There are kid- and vegan- friendly menu items. Great place to eat if you are in Tucson."}, {"review_id": "Yc63J8X1Tfy1PvuudDWySg", "user_id": "rEdep0txAwxCw4iMlCWlmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "4.5 stars. I don't think they have the best set up for taking your name/putting it on a list and having an area for you to wait... to be honest there is no area you can wait inside. I do like that they have a focus on locally sourced ingredients and supporting local farmers and purveyors. We came for brunch and waited about 30 minutes for a spot. Everyone was nice except for once waitress who blasted through a door I was opening to try to exit and not really smiling or saying excuse me or letting us go first. The space is kind of loud, but open. The food was great. We got the forbidden rice pudding, the blanco dish (the potato pancake with ham and a mornay sauce), and then the pulled pork sandwich. All were great. The pulled pork sandwich was one of the best I've ever had. I ordered the cactus flower peach shrub juice sparkling drink and it was so unique and refreshing I would hands down recommend it again. Overall I'd love to come back and explore more of the menu. I thought the food was very good and I like the emphasis on locally sourced ingredients"}, {"review_id": "xArrE7eSBEraRUQ6dwjVAg", "user_id": "PVjbDq2pLawIcLZ4K4tsiQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "Ok, so no one smiles in this place. There is just a heavy gloom, even the guests... what's going on?! Maybe it was the day in general, overcast... but still.Was busy, but not full. Sat at big table for just 4 of us. Service was quick and attentive. But I always felt like the server hated us, or her job or everyone. I tried to be extra smiley and showed appreciation, but nothing. Watched the rest of the staff and no one smiled... ever... the whole time but... there was one full of sunshine, she was smiling to everyone. She was not our server but came over to entertain my kids. She smiled with every guest. And even her smiling at Co workers, didn't even get one in return... and it's not like they were stressed out busy, it seemed like a comfortable work flow. I was impressed with prices, very affordable. Food came out quick, it was very good. Flavorful. Fresh. I got the egg sandwich... it was so messy and difficult to eat. And I'm the type of person that makes over easy breakfast burritos... but I kind of gave up and just ate as open faced... pancakes were fluffy and delicious. Bacon was amazing. Then got bill, oh. They get you with add ons and oh man, that add up quick. Oh well, my fault. Yes the food was great, service was good... but it really wasn't anything special. I like unique, can't find anywhere else and this place kind of lacked that magic."}, {"review_id": "X5u-XrjUO-6KS1wVdvSf5g", "user_id": "2N7AZ2tVtVp57BpduBDKkA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Bright spot in a pretty run down industrial type area.

The waiter messed up our coffee order, we waited 20 min to see him after other baristas dropped off our coffee. The whole atmosphere was gloomy and politically charged. Didn't realize I was coming in for hateful politics, I just wanted breakfast. The food was incredibly bland. Like I NEVER add salt, but I did this time. It was also cold. Not at all happy about this place. On a positive note they get a star for the sweet potato pancake."}, {"review_id": "AD2YADn8qSjCrspbFs95VQ", "user_id": "pWLX4RD_e6THhHxmVs7-3A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "I want to call this a hidden gem only because we drove around a bunch of times since we couldn't find it. We finally realized that a big tree was covering the name of the restaurant, as it's on the corner of the street. The wait time was about an hour for Sunday brunch. I'd say that's pretty normal, especially for a popular place (it could have been worse). We ended up only waiting 40 mins. They have a small patio outside where people were seated waiting so that was a nice area for that. I noticed that they have some water bowls outside as well for your pets  (I love that). The interior is larger than it seems from the outside. They have a small grocery area towards the back with some fruits and veggies,  as well as other snacks like crackers cookies and even items like jams. Some items seemed a bit overpriced but it's more so the convenience factor of buying while you are there vs visiting a store later. Our server was really attentive throughout our whole meal. I ordered the Bandito Blanco,  which I liked but thought the sauce was just okay  (and maybe a bit too much of it). I really enjoyed the the potato pancake though! I also ordered a coffee and was not at all a fan of it. My fiancé built his own breakfast and he was happy with it. Overall, I enjoyed my food and time there. Even though they were really busy, I never felt rushed. I'd defintely come back next time I'm in the area."}, {"review_id": "yUAszCzZiQvBjXFE7XWAUg", "user_id": "DOyK5el1fRFAzPiE9oHFpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "After leaving the gem and mineral show my group of four were famished. So glad this place popped up on Yelp at the top under organic search. With this place conveniently close, average of 4.5 stars and organic, local ingredients description on Yelp I really could pass it up. The place was a bit loud, very busy. Like the brunch rush hour you would expect on a weekend at a hot brunch spot. The vibe is very similar to some small healthy restaurants/hole in the wall places. Everything was delicious. Even the two nonhealthy eaters loved their coffee and meals. The pancake came out in one big plate. Amazing how moist and fluffy and big they were able to make it. 3/4 people at the table tried it and loves it. It had blueberries and bananas in it. One of us ordered Salmon Benedict's. She said it was delicious. I had the Cobb Salad that came with perfectly ripped , fried potato garnishes that I removed because I don't do fried foods, in house vinaigrette dressing made with honey not sugar, chicken, bacon , hard boiled eggs, and I requested the blue cheese on the side so my friend can eat it.I also tried Pork Torta. It's like pulled pork with a delicious creamy green sauce that looks like it's made with avocado, and we ordered it with gluten free English muffins instead of ciabatta bread. For less carbs we asked for open faced. Definitely coming back. The wait was 10-15 minutes long, parking was free on the street, but it did take some time after we were seated before orders were taken. It was a busy day and worth the wait. You get complimentary water pitcher at your table with ice in it."}, {"review_id": "5pL88JCWq_1sppmtFbkEaw", "user_id": "9kWMZaGyCn22g21Vc2ykPg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/25/2017", "text": "The service was right on point.

I advise if you try the \"big pancake\" or even a standard pancake, you share it with someone. No joke - they are big!

At my first bite I said, 'holy crap that's good!.' It was eggs, sharp cheddar, marinated tomato's, basil on a baguette bun. I also ordered it with avocado and chipotle vegan sausage. It's was 'knock your socks off' delish!! I highly recommend this one!My wife asked for the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. Is came with a potato cake (yummy), light salad (nice dressing, very good).
