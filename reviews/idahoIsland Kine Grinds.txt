I spotted it on a recent trip to Nampa and decided to duck in for a quick lunch on a subsequent trip out there. Been back twice since. Great flavors on the menu which consist of all your Hawaiian favs like teriyaki, kahlua pork, meatballs, pineapple, mac salad, loco moco (really basic and really good), lettuce wraps, katsu, curry. I could go on and on.  This place is super clean, including the bathrooms. They cater, too. Grab a combo plate, a fountain drink or crack a can of your favorite Hawaiian Sun flavor, pour that soy sauce on your rice, and enjoy. Super friendly staff will guide you thru the menu choices if you're not familiar with island grub. Definitely a great place for shorts, flip flops and friends."}, {"review_id": "Tabrn1_KGm4qgSz9KozJnw", "user_id": "0njy16vZEzMQgiOMsGZ3tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "First visit here. Food was pretty good overall. We shared the Saturday special which was ribs. They tested pretty good, however they were fairly tough. I also added lumpia and my wife added a dessert. A large family came in and the combined tables next to us felt very squished. The staff was very friendly and the decorations were fun and island themed. Prices and portions were very reasonable."}, {"review_id": "iPJdeYc_f27wy0Vk5W2BKQ", "user_id": "oQkmYofmMDOELFD3P7pkJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Finally found a great island food restaurant.

I wasn't disappointed- I ordered the pork adobo and a 3 piece lumpia (with a 3 piece to go)- the food was hot and delicious. The Mac salad needed a touch of seasoning but still very traditional- the only thing I didn't like was even though I was dining in I was given a plastic fork and knife and served on a paper plate- I can understand being given plastic cutlery when getting a to go order but not for dine in. Still 5 stars, next time I'll just get it to go."}, {"review_id": "46MGpZE7J9y6xfK_E8IXJw", "user_id": "CieP7Ay62BHh6v9eEF7FGQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "His was possibly the best pulled pork I have ever eaten .

This place is quickly becoming my favorite restaurant in Nampa. The moment you walk inside, you notice the Hawaiian decor and ambiance. We were immediately greeted by a friendly face and then had to make the hardest decision. Ultimately I settled on having their Teriyaki Beef which was amazing! I sampled some of my wife's Teriyaki Chicken and whoa was that one delicious as well. My next goal is to try something new on the menu next time we visit. My wife and I first had a taste of their delicious food at a wedding they catered about a month ago. We tried checking them out off Garrity but turns out they had moved. I was very pleased to later find out they simply decided to relocate in another part of town and stayed in Nampa. Can't get enough of this place and truly, this a gem worth visiting!"}, {"review_id": "6cJc5KMxZsJx5I6ZzhC_pw", "user_id": "abjstisYqlnj0rJHxgqpDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "We came at the right time!

The restaurant is clean and modern. You'll notice they have a minor show about every 2 hours of hula girls. The show lasted longer than I expected about 30 minutes. The food is just as good as it was before the previous location with the awful pictures on the menu reminiscent of a 1990s Mexican restaurant. If it wasn't such a far drive I would go there more regularly but being in Nampa that's how it is recommend this place to anyone going that way."}, {"review_id": "pH-E8fFSPh6aaPHNFXEIqg", "user_id": "StMdEHFpT0L5wfQH_kPIfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Ive Been here a 100 times and so far not once has it been bad.

The first half a dozen times I went in there, I got fountain drinks thinking they were built into the price so I got tea or soda because I usually just drink water.  Not until last visit did I ask and found out they do charge if you get anything besides water.  Just a heads up.  I wish this place was closer to home because I would be going here all the time.  A definite stop when I am in the area."}, {"review_id": "J-8TNRZXMJ89gaxF7AhqHw", "user_id": "Zg4HPcFsv4fDxj78EAfNHg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Delicious the wings are to die for and this is the best Mac salad I've ever had.  I can't wait to eat my leftover khalua pig because there is so much food.  This great out of the way place is a must."}, {"review_id": "Y8rneZ__V0zHIbJQgkpQjA", "user_id": "7TSMjdM62LUl9ocTVLtE3Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "My step-father and I are always looking for good places to eat in Nampa, because my mother is in hospice care here, and we live in Meridian. Our lives are sooo busy that it is just easier to grab a meal out when we have extra money and time. We had passed the place several times on our way to the interstate and home. We promised ourselves that we would check it out on one of our other trips to Nampa!Well, today we got our chance! We walked in and were greeted by a large smile, pretty brown eyes, and a bouncy 'fro, all attached to our beautiful, young waitress! We were the only ones in the place at the time, so she told us to sit wherever we liked. We chose a booth and each got flavored imported fruit drinks from Hawaii. Delicious, by the way, although there are no refills. :-(  I asked about Poi and she said the used to offer it in the other location, but that it didn't sell well, so they don't offer it anymore. Another bummer! :-( :O I was a little pensive about eating at a new place, because I have to be gluten-free. The waitress answered all my questions promptly and with a beautiful smile. Turns out that there are several gluten-free options and the one that I got was amazing! Pad Thai stir fry with shrimp and vegetables on the side in place of the Hawaiian Mac salad. I also got a mini plate of pork, vegetables, and rice. Had I known how much food they give you, I might not have ordered both, but I would have missed out on that wonderfully delicious and tender pulled pork with a wonderful, smokey flavor!They also offer smaller portions for children, if you happen to have them along, and you want to show them how to eat healthier, and add a little culture immersion. There is also music playing that almost no one would object to.Also offered is a rewards program where if you earn four stars you get $10.00 off your next order. Very do-able, by the way, because their food and service is impeccable!! I will DEFINATELY return many more times, for sure!"}, {"review_id": "-9gzFIxdi7wzsFRwAPdl0Q", "user_id": "eVwVoHBnnZe8s5GuqHrL_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2017", "text": "I'm sad they're farther tucked away into Nampa, but happy they have expanded and are able to support longer hours.
