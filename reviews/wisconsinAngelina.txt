We were seated quickly in the upstairs dining area (It was a Monday night right at 5 when they opened). I loved the decor and the atmosphere was very nice. Our waitress was great and very attentive to our needs. On Mondays (I'm not sure if it is every Monday) they offer two three-course dinner options one for $25 and one for $35. Each of these options has 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 3 desserts and you chose one of each. The fresh bread they bring out the with appetizers is delicious, but that is just the beginning.  I chose the Arugula salad with goat cheese, walnuts, pears, and oil for my appetizer.  It was small, yet full of flavor.  My entree was the papparadelle with Shrimp...This was they highlight of my meal.  The pasta was cooked perfectly as was the shrimp.  The definitely did not skimp on the shrimp either. the shimp were large so you could cut them into 2 or 3 pieces, but i had a bit of shrimp with every bite of noodle.  The sauce was also amazing, full of flavor.  For dessert I had the cannoli, which was a little bit of heaven.  I won't comment on my husbands meal as much, but suffice it to say he had the Pollo Alla Zia Tina and he thought it was amazing. It's a little more expensive than most restaurants we frequent, but definitely worth it. What a treat!"}, {"review_id": "c3ipvEmRX6gTP_FS5UCzew", "user_id": "EGRcixxBNi92pqm_YIhIqw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "Nice little place in downtown Green Bay with friendly staff and a small band in the bar area. The bar is small but they make the most of space limitations.The walk upstairs to the main dining room was a bit of a challenge for my old knees, but I survived and the dining area was nice.We had a new staff member being trained but she was doing a good job and her trainer was right there helping the process run smoothly.Food was \"ok\", not great. Not a big menu or filled with big taste.  Wine selection was about the same.  I would go again, but probably not for a special affair.  Have fun in Green Bay!"}, {"review_id": "JtN256BrEw8Iq5NdCjw6gg", "user_id": "WV5XKbgVHJXEgw7f-b6PVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "What a delightful little place. Stopped in for wine, a entrée to share and dessert with my husband. Our bartender Paige was so kind and gave great recommendations on the drinks and menu items. I started with a glass of moscato white wine. We shared the spinach ravioli with red sauce. I was actually really pleased that the ravioli were not swimming in sauce like some places tend to do. The bread service was a pleasant surprise with aged balsamic vinegar and yummy oil. Closing the night we shared some tiramisu which was more than enough for us both to share. I love the atmosphere here and will for sure be back."}, {"review_id": "-qFx6FkTrRmdQS5GxCvXxg", "user_id": "AXXMCNrdgST155kS4lLq-A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Very nice downtown Italian restaurant. Friendly and helpful staff, good food too. I'm not a huge Italian food connoisseur, however the chicken Marsala was tasty. Wednesday night wine down had bottles discounted nearly 1/2 off.

Ordered off the Restaurant Week menu and that was PLENTY to eat!!!  It was nice to get a properly made whiskey sour,  after having been very disappointed earlier with Hagermeister Park's weak attempt at the drink that's a bartender basic. Good job Angelina! The patio is lined with exposed brick and sprawling ivy (hmmm...like Wrigley Field) strung Edison cafe lights provide the perfect amount of lighting for a romantic evening or a more casual setting among friends. AUTHENTIC ITALIAN!!! NOT A SPAGHETTI HOUSE!Wait staff was very nice and attentive for busy Thursday and have no complaints."}, {"review_id": "bqE3Qyr3F9Sys3jTO7BBjQ", "user_id": "704FCmH3QryfTyBqZkofQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "I have never had a bad pasta dish here. This is one of the few places in Green Bay where I can order pasta and not specify for the chef to make it al dente. I just trust it will be perfect, and it has been!

They told us it would be a 20 min wait but it was definitely longer. We had a drink at the bar and enjoyed the live music that was playing. Upstairs dining experience was decent. We had slower service. I enjoyed the salad. We each had pizza and the sauce and toppings were good, but the bottom of the crust had several black spots on it which made it not as good. I've had plenty of other wood fired pizzas before where I haven't experienced the black spots on the bottom. They also provided bread service, which included balsamic oil and olive oil."}, {"review_id": "ruN6MbSq1QTzdwDbv5SXAg", "user_id": "Xs3932vecAjMJaJEcHgyZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/27/2016", "text": "Nice, simple, and clean restaurant.

I do wish they would update the menu a bit and work on their consistency as that would propel them into one of the better Italian places in the area (and we are lacking in good Italian places)."}, {"review_id": "kiNm_zQGmHL_bPNzkH0THA", "user_id": "Dkcr1DiQOpfGr4VOyDCXWw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2017", "text": "My husband and I ate here because there was a back door from the parking garage ( and we weren't familiar with the area enough to want to venture far).  We had a great experience.  We didn't have a reservation and were seated at the bar for about 10 minutes before being seated.  The waitress went over the specials and appetizers.  We ordered the cheese plate which consisted of 5 cheeses, grapes, capers, olives and fig jam and baguettes.  It was superb.  We split an entree which was the rigatoni with Italian sausage with mushrooms, onions, white wine and tomato sauce reduction.  Also fantastic.  We also had a glass of wine eachAll that along with a bread basket (olive oil, balsamic ve gear and Parmesan cheese) for a little over $50.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, our waitress and the atmosphere.  We'll be back!"}, {"review_id": "W_2NvVYHmbqNyWxugHzysw", "user_id": "yxcP8PUxaLIgg4UfTutXTA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/15/2017", "text": "Came home from Rhode Island for a family function.
