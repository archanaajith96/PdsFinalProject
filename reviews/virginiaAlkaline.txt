Anyway, I bit the bullet and visited this place. The aesthetics here are on point, in my opinion, if the music is good, the food usually will follow suite. Got the Tonkotsu Ramen, good the very last drop, wish I could make it a little more spicy but it got the job done but the MVP here were the wings. Boy-oh-boy the crunch! The flavors of soy and garlic, I mean..wow. This is what bonchon down the street is missing. Can't wait to come back and try some other ramen and the octopus appetizer.Oh and the server...despite how busy it was in there, she kept it going and made sure we were happy. Can't wait to come back."}, {"review_id": "A39Ii2bUOgXD_THKXxBWKw", "user_id": "LZQq0JoFEcGIB9aTTwDRLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "My sister and her husband are huge foodies and had been talking about this place for weeks, so when I visited I made sure it was on the list of places they take me to. From what I heard, Alkaline was previously in a smaller location, which explains how new everything felt--you know, when the decor is like half-way there and things don't feel quite lived in yet? The ambiance was exactly like that. I hope in a few more months, the decor will match the busy, NYC street restaurant vibe.What I love is their menu item that crosses American snacks with East-Asia influence. We ordered the tater tots that were similar to takoyaki. Hands down, the greatest idea I've ever tasted. The ramen was also pretty good, though I will have to try it again to really know how consistent their bowls are."}, {"review_id": "qV1EhttCprxBjCZMUwDyFg", "user_id": "J4l4Rn13-3Hjb_J-Ntgd9g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Ever since their move, the quality of the food has not been up to par. I came here one morning to try their \"dim sum.\" And I must admit I was very disappointed. It was a very expensive brunch for not that much food. And honestly, the food was sometimes not tasty. You can totally get better quality food at a better price elsewhere. And just because you have one single cart with maybe 4 or 5 dishes does not mean it can be called \"dim sum.\" I will say that the service is always excellent and the servers/owners are always on the floor asking customers about their experience. It seems Alkaline is very open to feedback and that's great. Because there was just that one giant cart going in and out of the kitchen, food was really slow. It just wasn't enjoyable and I felt even more sour after getting the bill for a sub-par brunch. I really hope they step up their food game. Their creativity and dedication to ethnic food was what set them apart for me and I hope they can get back to their roots."}, {"review_id": "a6jfsBLiXSVcOthRpwZCfQ", "user_id": "M4vXIxGukNs87YuNUdwWww", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "I really don't like to give one star reviews, especially to small local restaurants. But my experience yesterday requires the attention of a one star review. I will preface this by saying the food is pretty good, however my experience with the service was completely unacceptable.We had been to the new location on 21st once before and been told by the hostess there was a long wait despite the fact that there appeared to be open tables. The hostess told us that those were reserved so we managed to get a couple seats at the bar. This was about a month and a half ago.Last night I went out for one last good meal with my wife and a couple of friends prior to an extended at sea period, as Navy food doesn't quite cut it. We showed up and there was one group of people ahead of us and a couple of empty tables and the same hostess as last time said it would be 35-45 minutes. We gave our names albeit hesitantly and took a couple minutes to decide whether or not to eat at the bar or wait for a table.After about ten minutes, and the party ahead of us having been seated I decided to inquire about how long it would be as there was two open tables and this was getting a little frustrating. The hostess told us that we were next however that table was reserved. She then proceeded to tell me that I didn't understand how a list worked in what was evolving into a pretty impatient and rude tone. After a little back and fourth and her tone becoming increasingly more impatient and rude she told me she remembered me from trying to \"rush her\" last time and that I was impatient and I should watch my tone with her. At this point I told her I would like to speak with the manager to which the hostess replied \"I wish you would\" in a completely unacceptable and aggressive tone. The manager was hovering in the general area, as she had seen the situation developing. Initially she was a bit standoffish and attempted to defend her employee as I tried to explain the situation but as the hostess continued to personally insult me the manager asked her to go into the back of the restaurant.The manager apologized in a mostly genuine tone and said she had never seen the hostess act this way. She said she would get us a table and try to compensate us. At this point I was so blown away by what had transpired I wasn't really interested in eating at this restaurant. The hostess had at this point made her way back to her stool in the foyer of the restaurant and was giving me the death stare. We decided to leave and as we walked past the hostess and her scowl  my wife and I told her to have a nice night. She shot an even dirtier look at my wife which obviously upset me so I told her that she was a hostess and should not treat people this way. This woman took this as a personal insult and threw her clipboard on the ground and swung the doors of the restaurant open, following the group of us into the parking lot. She screamed in our general direction in an aggressive tone calling me a \"douche bag\" and repeatedly saying \"you don't know me\". We were making our way out of the parking lot and she made a point to tell us that she was a college student and an Air Force Reservist in what seemed to be an attempt to make us feel like we had wronged her, however as my friend and I are both currently Active Duty Navy the fact that she had tried to pull the military card on us in that context only served as an additional insult. It goes without saying that the way we were treated was COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE and has no place in any restaurant ever. That fact that someone could treat customers that way and still remain employed by that establishment will prevent me from ever returning. I hope that the management corrects this deficiency as the food is pretty good."}, {"review_id": "aCUh7_O27eh03AJ-z138BQ", "user_id": "HT7T6OaKuJHU35j9u0LUDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We checked out their new location, and it made me actually love this place even more. Here's why: 1) they now take reservations, which is my absolute favorite thing that a restaurant can do. Every other time we've been there, we've either had to get there right when they open or had to wait for a table. 2) their beverage selection has vastly expanded since my first review. Not only do they now offer Coke products, they also have a full bar & offer cocktails. I had the Tom Khallins and absolutely loved it. The chili threads were really interesting though. You didn't taste them, but you smelled them every time you took a sip. The service & food are still absolutely wonderful. My only complaints are that the music is too loud, and the lighting isn't conducive for taking photos of your meal ;)"}, {"review_id": "I0R9K26HW5twmikpCfKmUg", "user_id": "iZuPeyqGXF0QisZXct8OLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "Is there a secret menu?

The flavor of the sticky wings, ramen and assorted drinks will ensure I return.I guess a few visits at randomly chosen times, I can find out if they have a brunch/buffet and other variations on the menu for me to drool over.Busy parking lot shared by other businesses. Booth seating and some seating at the bar. Great customer service, minimal wait time for food to arrive and plenty of ambiance to soak in.When ordering the ramen, it has an add on option of pork belly. I didn't like the texture and flavor of it. Any other time I'd make an open face pork belly sandwich. The ramen is good without it. There is also a veggie ramen option if you are dining with non-meat eaters.

So after having eaten here, it's safe to say I could eat at Alkaline for the rest of my days and say I lived a VERY happy life. We arrived 15 minutes early and eagerly waited outside with a few others. Within 30 minutes, the entire restaurant was packed, patrons waiting for tables were lined up at the front of the restaurant whilst the lucky ones sat on the comfy bench. The food itself was so flavorful. I highly recommend the crispy baby octopus and shrimp. It's a little on the spicy side, but the herbs/spices used to wrap the fried seafood really complimented the dish well - top it off with some lemon and wow, perfection. I had the Shoyu ramen for main and was not disappointed at all. The chicken/dashi broth tasted amazing and wasn't over seasoned with soy. The dish came packed with noodles, pickled ginger, sous vide egg, narutomaki, shredded pork and scallions. A generous portion size I'd say.I was so full but slurped all my broth up, but my hubby is more of a noodles man - half way through dinner he'd already finished all his noodles... but it's ok, Alkaline are ready for the noodle lovers! Just order a refill (kaedama on the ramen extras menu, $2!) Technically still in their soft opening period, I'm already sold and will 100% come back to make my way through the menu. Angeline our server (who was such a babe) also told us about some dim sum being in the pipeline at lunchtimes - excited doesn't even cut it!

The ramen comes with lots of scallions, a poached egg, and lots of shredded pork. Portion size was great! The pork belly side came with two large pieces of thick cuts of pork, and it was cooked very well - nice and fatty without being too oily or greasy. My fiance had the spicy curry ramen which was also delicious, but definitely has a kick to it!I was lucky enough to snag two seats right at dinner with little to no wait even though the bar was packed too! I definitely recommend getting here earlier or trying to call ahead to make a reservation. I tried to call them a couple times but their line just stayed busy!  This place has cool vibes, lots of anime decorations, and fun music.

I have missed the ramen here and after coming here for lunch last weekend makes me wanna eat here more often.The location is in the same shopping center as Farm Fresh and shares a parking lot with several other businesses so parking can be a bit tricky. There is definitely a lot more seating here but it's still limited to a max capacity of about 40 people. The music here selection here was on point: old school rap/hip hop, fresh mixes combined with some random KPOP music. The interior also has some nice ramen artwork that I saw before I left.When you come for lunch, the only \"meat\" you can add to your ramen is either chicken or pulled pork and I was sad to hear that you can only add pork belly to ramen for their dinner time selections. I got the classic tonkotsu ramen and we split the tater tots for our appetizer. My friends who were coming out of town had never had ramen and didn't have any expectations. The tater tots were a great way to start and was a fairly large serving. My ramen was delicious like it was last time; the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente and the broth was scrumptious and not overly salted. Halfway through we decided to get the pork belly entree and we added that to ramen. The pork belly is worth getting; it's amazingly tender, juicy and has a nice char on the outside.The service was excellent. Our waitress (Angelica? It ended with an A...) was very friendly and came by to check up on regularly. I think the prices are fairly reasonable. I can't wait to come back for their dinner so I can truly add the pork belly to my ramen!"}, {"review_id": "4YOaXZuHkjZQWSnflegLDQ", "user_id": "8C4TZrPIbPobMjuJ1uKJaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Came in here a couple weeks ago with my homegirl, as it was our first time trying the place. Aw man, this place was PHENOMENAL. For an appetizer we got the crispy baby octopus and shrimp. It was absolutely amazing! It had all the right flavors, it wasn't too soft or too crunchy, it was just right. We had asked for sauce and we were offered this red sauce (not sure what it was exactly), but honestly, we didn't even need it. I got the vegetable ramen, because i'm weird and i'm not a big fan of meat in my soup unless it's chicken noodle lol! But it was so good! The broth was just wonderful. Perfect to my liking! Salty! There was so much in my bowl, I couldn't finish it all. The only thing I wish they offered for the ramen I got, was corn. I'm a sucker for corn in my ramen lol. But never the less, still exceeded my expectations!We also ordered beers that our server recommended us! We got japanese beers, I can't recall the names of them, but they were good as well! We did get waters though, and they didn't come with ice. I have a preference of ice cold, lemon drenched water lol - maybe I can ask for a glass of ice on the side next time!Lastly, the dessert. I had no room for dessert at all, but it just sounded so good! We HAD to order it. Let me tell you, I literally had HEART eyes and tears, with how good the miso butter cake was! Every single bite had me wanting more. I wanted to order one to go, but I knew it wouldn't taste the same as it being fresh. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING IT.I believe I found out about this place because my God mothers, brother owns it/works here? Can't remember exactly. But, support your local businesses! Can't wait to come back and try more food on the menu!

Alkaline to the rescue!As a testament to how good their ramen is, my husband and I came back twice within the first week of trying it. It's so worth the trip! My husband and I are crossing off their items from their limited menu as we go. So far we've had their shrimp and baby octopus, their diniguan (pork blood \"stew\") nachos, tonkotsu and shoyu ramen, and last but not least the miso butter cake. So far most of them are a home run! Their tonkotsu is rich and creamy which is what I look for. The shoyu is on the lighter side when it comes to the broth but packs the same amount of flavor. The shrimp and baby octopus was nice, crunchy, and filled with garlic flavor - yum! You HAVE TO, just HAVE TO save room for their miso butter cake because it's probably the BEST cake I've ever had.Their service is also top notch. Both times we came they were already packed but the servers are always accommodating and makes sure you are updated on how long the wait is going to be. They make sure your waters are filled accordingly and that you're enjoying your time and the food that you've ordered without being overbearing. The only reason they didn't get a five star was although the space they have is adorable, I always have to keep my jacket on because it IS FREEZING inside. I'm sure that will be fixed once they move into their new space so it's not a huge deal. Another was I didn't care for their dinuguan nachos. It had the nuance of the flavor but not enough to taste like home. Their pulled pork is also a bit weird for my taste, and the add on for the braised pork belly (a whopping $4 for a piece) is not worth since it's a bit tough.Through everything though their ramen broth and the perfectly cooked noodles will keep me coming back!"}, {"review_id": "_b8X9ZQoBjcbV5gzZ7viHQ", "user_id": "J8l26Rx09egc9A1mcxQDMw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "\"Miso Butter Cake\" is what you MUST get here!

A sucker for specialty drinks, I tried both the Tom Khallins and the Young Bae. The coconut infused beefeater gin was delicious in the Tom; very subtle and not overly sweet/in your face.
