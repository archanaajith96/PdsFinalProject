Both times the service was quick, attentive and engaging. The ambiance was amazing. They did a great job replicating an English pub. The food was just ok anyway you slice it. I had the Philly dip and the periogies per my servers request. The Philly dip solid not bad and not great and the periogies are ehhh not so good. The carefully crafted cocktails we're really good. I tried some play on a Manhattan and some strange rum drink with all spice. Both were well constructed and had an amazing balance.  I was truly impressed with the wine list. For being a pub, they really put some thought behind it. The selections were esoteric but palate friendly. My overall experience was amazing and the service and drinks are enough to keep me coming back all the time."}, {"review_id": "okL8F00hS5jtFC9qfU6HPw", "user_id": "ZuVIbvRKwpL0d2DIHVAs3w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I've always been a fan of the Winchester and the goods they serve up. This spot has been slanging that good stuff for some time now and I really have had no issues with what they do. I've been for lunch and dinner and haven't experienced anything to make me want to stop enjoying this place. On this particular visit, we came for lunch and reveled in the five-dollar Bloody Mary bar and a couple select items from off the menu. One item that stood out from all the rest was what I ordered, the fish and chips. Winchester chefs take a whole sea bass and flash fry it to perfection. Yes,  the head and all. It comes on a metal tray with yucca fries and Latin slaw. Also gets an accompaniment of chipotle caper aioli for the fries and a tasty lime cilantro dip for the fish. This fish dish can compete with the best of fish fries anywhere. I was floored and must come back to eat this again!All around Winchester is always a solid go to spot for food! Between the service and the location, it will always remain second to none in my book."}, {"review_id": "n1rm38rGGAy5ppIcsiq4Fg", "user_id": "SkcKsBHLmzFMuARhgt37Vg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "This review follows...oh? Perhaps, over 20 visits to the Winchester. 95% of my time here is for a happy hour cocktail. Since the Winchester opened, their gluten free menu options have slowly weaned. We stopped in here on a Friday night for dinner. There was a 30-40 minute wait to be seated (at 7:15ish pm) but we quickly found two bar stools then dined at the bar. Here's the thing: the staff know less than 10% about allergen needs and their menu doesn't identify allergy needs, yet they are identified as a gluten free dining place on Yelp. The redeeming factor is the chef is creative and open to making something work that can be gluten free. The fact that the wait staff is 100% reliant on their chef to know what can be modified required several trips - back and forth conversations before I was able to narrow down what my choices were. The final dish I ordered this night was incredible in taste, prevention, and portion. My partners non-gluten free food order was satisfying for him, too.This place fills quickly at lunch, dinner, and especially on weekend evenings. Staff is friendly and the bathrooms are clean. There is off-street and on-street parking. All furnishing is wood - high and low-top seating, minimal booths that are fully wood. Lighting is dim and daytime natural lighting is 100% in the front of the bar, 75% towards the back."}, {"review_id": "vCa0CO4mNNoQfnNsTRd9pg", "user_id": "tvn6_ztq_zRxb0blOOogxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "The vibe and look of this place is really cool. I like the open industrial look. The ramen was ok and had a lot of vegetables which is good but needs more noodles. The flavor is spot on though. The Naan turkey sandwich is really good as well as the Cuban Rueben. I would define pry recommend if you are in the area.

We walked in, and there were plenty of tables to choose from. They quickly accommodated our group by pushing a few tables together on the patio.  (Side note: their stools are very comfortable!) The actual drink list has more selection than the menu,  but all the offerings sound yummy. There is no gluten free menu.   I had a grey goose vodka tonic and some meat skewers off the appetizer menu. (If you are eating these for a dinner, I recommend getting 2-3 of them). I enjoyed the chicken skewer, but the shrimp was a tad spicy for me- I feel like it could have been amazing with less heat and more (other) spices to fill out the flavor of the shrimp.  My friend had the lobster roll, and enjoyed it with special kudos to the chickpea side salad. Another friend had the onion rings: she said they were amazing in flavor, just a tad on the greasy side.All in all, my vodka tonic and 3 skewers plus tip arrived at $31. Not bad for an occasional night out.Kudos to Taylor for great, friendly and timely customer service!"}, {"review_id": "PIp2rSlnb-MfH0QeT01H9Q", "user_id": "3XT_xWbKl-6V9EVPaa1JJg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Met for drinks at Winchester last night and was able to grab a seat on the patio. Over the years the menu has slowly gotten smaller and smaller here.. not many options for \"entrees\" in my opinion. Pretty much shareable plates and sandwiches (they do have a decent brunch menu). I asked about the Yakitori and was told it was pretty small.. since I was going to make this my meal, i figured I'd better be safe and get an order of calamari, too. Good think I did because the Shrimp Yakitori was literally 4 shrimp on a skewer. They were good but... it was small even for an appetizer! Calamari was also very small! Very good and spicy. Other person got the Moroccan wings- 3 large wings that smelled amazing. Happy Hour was only a $1 off anything (I assume because she was a little vague).Service was great, ambiance is great, food was delicious.. just wish they had more entree type options instead of sandwiches."}, {"review_id": "_mYO5fj_rmFZEPmszbgFUA", "user_id": "0dHBPR0U2pKU5r2DTCbPuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/9/2016", "text": "First, I'd like to say, I love Wealthy Street. It has some of the best places in GR. The Winchester is one of them. Had a solid, solid brunch there on my last trip out. First, best bloody mary bar outside of my favorite place in Columbus for that, Knotty Pine. Second, awesome brunch menu. I wanted to try over 60% of the menu. We ordered the donuts, a biscuit, the chicken and waffles, the black and blue poutine, and the pesto polenta. The only fail was the wretched biscuit they served.  Day old, crumby, chewy, and tastless dispite cheesey. While this was an offensive attemp at a biscuit, the other items shined so bright, you don't need to worry about it. Just forget about the biscuit. Donuts were hot, fresh, and wow with a raspberry melba sauce that made it like a warm jelly donut dream. Chicken and waffles were on a fantastic cornmeal waffle. Spicy and sweeter sausage gravy added a nice touch to the crunchy fried chicken breast. The poutine had a huge portion of on-point steak and crispy potato wedges, while the gravy was alittle too sweet, the steak was too perfect to ignore. The polenta was a tad runny, but the pesto and charred broccolini with a perfect soft boiled eggs were a good meal. My bloody mary, crappy biscuit, and polenta were only $18 after tax and before tip. A steal, really. Service was good, Not invasive, but attentive. Atmosphere was fun and relaxed. I want to go back for more bloody marys and to make my way through the menu.Recommended!"}, {"review_id": "zsAtdFn-knNyXPrsNMsRRg", "user_id": "jRSlW1yFPdfo-atwmvK1Sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/6/2017", "text": "The classic burger is perfection.

The food is worth 4 stars. Don't get me wrong it was very good. We were seated promptly and courteously, and it went downhill from there. The waitress didn't come by for over 10 minutes. I am assuming it was the manager, eventually brought us water and took our drink orders after about 7 minutes.  After the waitress made her appearance, somebody brought our drinks by. She eventually came bay and we were able to order. Starters came out, brought by some snark from somewhere. Delivered to the middle of the table, without a word and disappeared.  But wait, how are we to eat them??? Zero plates or silverware. Waitress, nowhere to be found. I finally found 5 plates and sets of silverware and we could begin. The meal arrived a short time later, delivered by the same \"friendly\" delivery girl. Waitress finally made it around about 1/2way through the meal to check on us. By this time, we were out of drinks and water. She walked away. I got her attention and we got our refills. I asked her to tell the bartender to go a little lighter on the sweet vermouth for my Manhattan. Came back just the same. Ugh. Anyhow finished eating and left, but it was so disappointing. It was the first time I left less than 15%. I am usually a 22-25% tipper.
