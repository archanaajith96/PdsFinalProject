It had a generic sounding name, but had incredible reviews and lots of them. Too good to be true, right? Nope it's totally true. This place is amazing. The waiter took the time to talk through menu with me. I love pho and usually get it, but the menu looked so good I had to try something new. He recommended the lamb curry. Sounded risky but I went for it. It's by far the best curry dish I've ever had. Super tender lamb, great smooth spice on the sauce, and it was huge (really should be shared by two people). And wouldn't you know it, the waiter brought out a small bowl of the pho as an appetizer on the house so I could try it. That was really good, too. Nice broth, tender meet. I'm going to have to run many miles in the morning to work this off, but so worth it. Next time I'm in Denver I'm coming back here!"}, {"review_id": "bLxNuqffhqPqaFK0-z27xg", "user_id": "UC56Tmgx6khUQSAil-DZRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "Always superb quality of food and service..My 1st visit was back in 1996..it's more than 20 years now..But they never been disappoint me Their seafood hot pot is top notch..And combination rice wrap as well..Best of best in town for sure."}, {"review_id": "RjcRM18VWmk314zyEg1pdw", "user_id": "FcW2QdsAxn1fNauHkq3iBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "This place is awesome!

Chinese seems to be a bit lack luster all over the city but here they prepared a top notch sesame tofu and hot and sour soup. When I placed the order I must say what they placed in front of me was not my initial expectation.  Prior to this order tofu has usually come as is so when I saw the very large doughy pieces I thought it was chicken!Much to my surprise it was in fact tofu and very delicious. The dough was light and airy and a perfect crunch to the softer tofu insides.  Served with a heaping pile of white rice and fresh veggies, the dish lasted me 3 meals!  I started with the hot and sour soup, sub from the egg drop, and it was just what I needed for my current scratchy throat. Overall very satisfied and will have to come back to try the Vietnamese!"}, {"review_id": "cqvXww8WCeK9BbAjo7GX7A", "user_id": "rfrGUutYChaO1qmfRAOm0w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "You can tell this is a family-run restaurant and I absolutely love that.

From the appetizers to the dessert we were blown away by the perfect execution of each dish. We had the Fried Shrimp, Dumplings, Chicken Curry, Vegetable Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour chicken, and chocolate coffee cake. Everything was delicious and we all left happy. The service couldn't have been better, which was the cherry on top. I often go to new places and think to myself it was good, but I probably wouldn't go there regularly. This was the kind of place that I will crave and will go to regularly.

The attached spring roll photo clearly shows the measliest piece of beef inside that I could ever imagine. Pretty disappointing and tiny spring rolls. The chicken pho is good, no different from any other standard you might find.

So maybe they open a bit earlier than the posted hours? The inside was surprisingly classier than the outside. However, it also felt kinda dark and dusty interior-wise. There were only 2 waitresses, who also checking you out at the register; and 1 other guy, who brings the food out and take your dishes away once you're done. We ordered one special combo rice and one bún bò Hu. They were both served in healthy portions and tasted pretty good. Right after we ordered and before our food comes out, they offered some complimentary pork spring rolls which was okay; my fav part was probably the peanut sauce. I give this place 4 stars overall. Tasty food, decent service, a-okay atmosphere and cleanliness. Will come back next time if I'm around the area."}, {"review_id": "wZ6f_I-qB_yXFWIpgUcEbQ", "user_id": "IcB8cBj0M17HByZhvckv8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I am floored every single time I have visited this incredible restaurant. The food... oh my goodness...everything...everything. The staff are the greatest, the history in the building - I promise you, well worth the experience!!! I have been here twice now (in a month) and if I lived closer, I would be here once a week. Seriously though, this is delicious, traditional, authentic vietnamese food. So full of robust flavors. Please please try the jasmin tea, the hot pot (all of them are amazing), the egg rolls, chicken wings, the curry (one of my favs) - but really anything on the menu will be satisfying and leave you craving it days after! I love this place and if you're in the area, do not miss out on this dining experience!!"}, {"review_id": "hEH4r2JR63xgamlLbSspww", "user_id": "pOXt03zgGr-bbUI2_O6gdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/23/2017", "text": "Wow. Amazing service and food. My friend and I were immediately greeted by the owner of the restaurant. He was kind enough to give us free appetizers (spring rolls and crab cheese wantons). The food menu here is inexpensive for the huge portions that they give. They have pho for noodle fanatics, but also an extensive viet and Chinese menu (check out my photos!)I ordered the Bon Bo Hue, which is spicy beef broth with noodles and meat. The broth is incredibly rich and has a good kick of spice. It's not overwhelmingly spicy, so the flavors of the onions, cilantro, and basil really come through. The cuts of meat are thick and plentiful. This restaurant is conveniently located off of Parker close to Yale. Lots of parking. Come check them out!"}, {"review_id": "9sbTpwo365qMcYJWlKJSOw", "user_id": "9XJq-lmj_3YPQHS_nDvh4Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/30/2017", "text": "Pretty good food, not stellar, but I can't believe how FILTHY this place is!! Why hasn't the health department come down on this armpit? Our server was a bubbly young lady, but she seemed to be the only one in the whole restaurant waiting on tables. There was a clueless young man who bounced around and cleaned tables, but didn't do a very good job. I wanted the seafood bowl, but my server recommended the seafood chowmein. Hubby ordered seafood curry and we ordered the crab & cream cheese wontons that were supposed to have crab inside.....? Nope. Mostly cheese. The house soup had mini slices of asparagus and imitation crab meat in a gelatinous broth which had very little flavor. We were served Vietnamese spring rolls which were utterly flavorless and had over cooked shrimp and pork inside. Ew. My seafood dish came out and it was actually pretty good with the seafood not being overcooked. There was absolutely no spice in my dish, so I asked for some chili oil which helped. I'm not a big fan of the fried chow mein noodles, so I do not recommend getting it that way at all. My husband's curry was pretty tasty, but skimpy on the seafood. I went to use the ladies room and the floor was sticky. I will not return and do not recommend this place because it's disgusting in the customer area, I can only imagine how the kitchen is!!"}, {"review_id": "v7BxdgSAic-9tLhMnNYnSw", "user_id": "amCyhxQgSLr7qBUa185CjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Great Vietnamese AND Chinese.

I was a little underwhelmed.I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.First off, I want to point out that the service was really great! Super friendly and always making sure that our glasses were full. Our server even brought us some gyoza/mandoo on the house because our food took a little longer to come out. That was really thoughtful and nice of her. Great customer service - no complaints about that.One thing I did have a problem with is how dust filled the inside is! I'm just kind of shocked at all the dust that I saw on the ceilings. It just makes me think if where we eat is that dusty, what does the kitchen look like? We sat in a booth and I also noticed that the top corner areas of the booth were also pretty dusty. It was a huge turn off.Now, for the food. I tried the pho and although it wasn't bad, it was definitely not the best I had. It had a different taste to it than the pho that I'm used to. The taste wasn't bad though, just different. I didn't really care for the meat. I felt that it was on the thicker side and maybe not the best quality. I will say that the prices are pretty good for the portion.I would consider coming back to give more of the menu a try, if they decided to dust the place."}, {"review_id": "aeLoRNieB1QHCmIbcEAiCg", "user_id": "BpVQ1u_kcNSicwbYHuDDtA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/30/2017", "text": "This place is the best.
