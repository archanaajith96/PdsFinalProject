They've got a small bakery selection for you to enjoy with your espresso/coffee drink. There's even a really cool display showing all the different types of espresso drinks offered. While you won't find anything with crazy or unique flavors, what you will find is delicious and wholesome drinks.

It has such a cool Bohemian-Hipster vibe to it. Normally that stuff doesn't appeal much to me, but for some reason, it just works here. The baristas are all super friendly and helpful and the coffees are great! I used my Yelp check in to get 10% off of the medium latte I had. Good stuff. The espresso was bold yet smooth.They had a small showcase of baked goods, however, none of it tempted me. The inside is pretty big with tables that extends to the far back near the restroom. The front of the cafe has lots of bright natural lighting, but it's also a bit warmer up front because of that. There's a small stage to the right of the entrance where they have open mic nights and local musicians perform. The cafe also gives local artists a chance to disply their work within too. You'll see some on the shelves.Lastly, they have free WiFi. So go get your laptop and get over there!"}, {"review_id": "3qws8eHrgjAMdthBEglunw", "user_id": "Z0IhRX-LE6aoSuZeBHmUDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Really cute atmosphere, great tea !

Servers warmly greeted guests as they walked in. Within five minutes of ordering, I was sipping on my hot chocolate. There's free WiFi here making it a great place to study as you sip on your drink. There's casual music playing in the back and sometimes there are even performers who come to play some music at the front of the store. There's ample amount of seating but you might have some difficulties finding a seat since many bunk down with their laptops out and will do work. There's some pastries too- gotta try that out in the near future."}, {"review_id": "7dt7WIXx9GtkGauVG9fuMQ", "user_id": "NvDrK2fvNlRfOOMMEoAFCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "I spend a lot of time in coffee shops. A lot. And Steam is definitely one of the better ones. It has a hipster vibe which manages to be friendly and entirely unpretentious, plenty of seating, good coffee, a fabulous variety of flavor shots (amaretto - how long had it been since I'd had that?) and well-maintained gender-neutral bathrooms which are great not only for socially conscious reasons but also because, let's be honest, there is ALWAYS a line for the ladies' room while the men's room sits awkwardly empty most of the time other places!Anyway - really would get 5 stars except for a couple minor issues. First, yeah, the coffee is good, but it's not mindblowing or even particularly memorable, hence no hesitation from me ordering flavor shots. Secondly, I've only ever been here in July but if you're going to sit and work for a while, the A/C is really pretty overcompensated. And the only other complaint I have is that I was there while they had open mic night or local musicians there a few times and it was just kind of awkward. Obviously a lot of people are working and ignoring the performer anyway, but there really wasn't any acknowledgement even from the people working there, no introduction of any real kind, just kind of an uncertain unspoken \"I guess I'll just start playing now\" type of thing happening which almost made the music feel like a bit of an intrusion rather than an open, accepting space for people to play.That being said, the baristas are great and witty and the vibe of the place overall - particularly afternoons - is fabulous, managing to be cozy and welcoming at the same time as it is laid-back and nonintrusive. Would definitely recommend."}, {"review_id": "vE-Mku3rOYbQrXuTF0zwtQ", "user_id": "ZqB271uTh0KrrbIL5bzCqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "Great atmosphere, big enough so you can have quite and privacy but small enough to be warm and cozy!

And here's why: I live 1,911 miles from this lovely little coffee spot. For anyone doing the geographical math --- I live in Los Angeles, and my boyfriend lives in...you guessed it....Rochester. Don't ask - it works. With Valentines Day swiftly approaching I was scrambling for a special surprise for him and knowing that he frequents Cafe Steam pretty much every day for his morning caffeine - I gave them a call with a crazy request. Me: \"I'm trying to arrange for a surprise for my boyfriend. Do you guys sell cupcakes?\" Them: \"Actually --- we do not. We sell more breakfast-y baked goods. Why? What did you have in mind?\" Me: \"I'd love for you to present my boyfriend with 3 cupcakes with a 'c', 'v' and '+' on a nice plate once he sits down, on Valentines Day.\" Them: \"Let me see what we can arrange. Maybe we can bring in some Valentine's cupcakes just for you.\" Say what? In Los Angeles you'd be hard pressed to find someone interested in bending even slightly sideways - much less \"over backward\". But these lovely people - the owner, and the manager William - went so above and beyond. I sent them a card to give him and arranged for a gift card too. Nothing was an annoyance or too much. They actually took on this project with such a great attitude that I was amazed. AND...the end result is shown here. I expected them to simply write on the cupcakes with a crappy gel frosting pen (beggers can't be choosers), but oh no....they presented him with THE most adorable cupcakes EVER. Honestly - sheer perfection. He was over the moon, (and he said they were dee-licous too!).Thanks to everyone at Cafe Steam for being so incredibly awesome. If I lived in Rochester you'd have a big fan and a regular customer."}, {"review_id": "vwJziF-ZLoszeDBQP_lauw", "user_id": "NwT-2InoGS-0rXRc6badUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "Nice coffee place in downtown, probably the best.

I am not a coffee drinker, but I can vouch for the tea being decently priced and wonderfully made. My only complaint is the lack of space to sit at times, which is not something the place can control - way to go at being so successful, Steam!! I love the punchcards they offer - fill out one and get a free beverage, fill out five and get a free locally designed Cafe Steam t-shirt!

The comfy booths, cute tables, and light background vibes make it the perfect place to study, read, or just hang out. The endless strips of outlets are clutch. It definitely gets super crowded on the weekends though, which can be a bit distracting if you're trying to study. The crowd dies down maybe around 3pm. I'm afraid to admit how much money I've spent on coffee here, but everything I've tried is top notch. My favorite is the chai latte (and also pumpkin spice latte during the fall).

Unlike chain cafes, this one has authenticity that is difficult to replicate. They have unique options of teas also that does have a multicultural background behind it. I love their jasmine tea. Their coffee is not too strong and not weak, just right. It tastes different from other coffee shops and tastes great. Just unique, that's the right word for it.I was really impressed when I found out that they showcase the works of a lot of local artists, painters, musicians,... etc. Now that is what a cafe should do! Inside the cafe, you'll quickly capture the sense of belonging. It's beautifully decorated. Staff are kind and nice to chat with. Ask them what your mood is and they'll fish you up with just the right drink for the time of the day.I very often come here with friends and hand out, study, read, or just talk about stuff."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-steam-rochester-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
