As soon as they open a franchise opportunity I will be the first to jump on! While the place may need a bit of an upgrade or potential location change this is to say the least as the food is top notch! Get it while you can because hours are short! They tease you and they know they do! The brisket is unreplicateable and the BBQ sandoor trio is AMAZING!!!My mouth is watering thinking about then right now: I love this place."}, {"review_id": "-Ye7TviPjxXHhfD3hSGpAw", "user_id": "D-5MBBagQWSOtMoYBEcRug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Best BBQ in Southeastern VA maybe in ALL of VA. Pork BBQ, Brisket, Smoked Turkey, Ribs(only on Fridays) are top notch. Sides are fantastic. Service is fast and friendly. Not the biggest place so don't expect room to bring the family and have a sit down meal but don't let that deter you. I try to eat here at least once a week. If you are ever in Deep Creek be sure to drop by and try the best BBQ you've ever had. Be sure to try the JohnBoy. P.S. Anyone giving this place bad reviews either has no idea what good BBQ is or was born without taste buds.

The address makes Apple maps go to some neighborhood right behind it. I walked in as a first timer with two friends. The inside is small and very much the mom and pop barbecue restaurant that you would expect. The owner and his son were working and I was pleasantly surprised by how warm and welcoming and relaxed they were. I felt at home immediately. This restaurant is apparently locally renowned for their ribs as well as their brisket. Both of which were sold clean out by 3 in the afternoon. Another customer asked about that and the owner happily explained that he would much rather keep his food's quality up and not serve something that is no longer fresh. To that, I almost broke into applause. Definitely check this place out! You won't be disappointed!!!"}, {"review_id": "91GzB_6jrYjUDeA7Pn0RRw", "user_id": "K6cjUFIAWkobfzBlNhEUHQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "You will never regret going here, they have the best BBQ around.

Ribs is one of my favorite foods!!! ( plus, I consider myself a BBQ or smoke rib expert!!..lol lol lol)I got my slab ribs to go. The smoked rib aroma took over the car... I had to taste them..OMG, OMG!! These ribs was perfectly season and grilled/ smoked!! These are the BEST EVER ribs in Virginia!!!! Kudos to The Grill Master!!Oooooo the barbecue sauce was on point! I requested my ribs to be without the sauce. Due to a lot of places pour extra sauce over the ribs and it takes away from the flavor of ribs.These ribs were so good ..I could eat them again, today. IF I had some left.My husband, also thought the ribs was perfectly done correctly!"}, {"review_id": "320JdITPHZez9X7nhYHy7A", "user_id": "Wt_LauHIGNKzlLfs8IlgCg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "A diamond in the rough for BBQ.

The only option was a container of hand sanitizer on the counter. I used it but noticed that it was very diluted and wasn't sure as to its effectiveness. I ordered a MacDaddy brisket sandwich which is their largest at 6 oz. I added baked beans and cole slaw for sides with a drink. While waiting for my food which was only about 5 minutes, I noticed that this restaurant has limited seating both inside and out under the front patio. When the food arrived I went outside to eat. The sandwich was very good. Very good bread bun and meat. Quality taste for sure and I graded the sandwich at a 4. The beans were a 4.5 and the cole slaw a 4. I really enjoyed this meal and quickly determined that they know how to make very good BBQ here. I understand and agree with it's high ratings. They close most days by 5 p.m. Also the food here is reasonably priced."}, {"review_id": "oKXBdKGhwYywJ51cCoJO_A", "user_id": "JRAy4P4op3PCISZaMRA9_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2016", "text": "It's sad to say that I found the best BBQ joint in all of Hampton Roads right before I move away. I'm such a dummy! I knew about The BBQ Shack (TBS) for quite some time, but I thought it was further away than it actually was. Today I realized they are only 20 minutes from my house! Suffice it to say, I will visit as often as I can until I leave.TBS is a tiny restaurant, offering a small menu and catering to mostly to-go clienteles, as they do not have many tables. The locally owned business, and who opened in 2010, consists of the owner, his daughter and her boyfriend. During my first visit, I got a chance to talk with the daughter and she was wonderful. I quickly realized why their 5-star average rating on Yelp continues to dominate in the BBQ world. Now, let's talk about their food! Here are my favorites:Top 3 Meats:1) Brisket 5*2) Ribs 4.5*3) Pulled Pork 4* Not recommended: TurkeyI've never been a big fan of brisket until I tried TBS's brisket. Man oh man--was that good! So moist, tender and flavorful! Highly recommend their brisket. The ribs were tender, smoky and tasty, especially when you add their delicious rib sauce. They're only available on Fridays so keep that in mind and go early! Their pulled pork is a bit unique compared to others; they use a vinegar sauce and a bit of heat.I've read that their turkey is great so maybe I was there on a bad day, but my turkey was kind of dry. Top 3 Sides:1) Beans 5*2) Coleslaw 4.5*3) Green Beans 4*Honorable Mention: Macaroni and CheeseNot recommended: Potato SaladMy first visit I got the beans and coleslaw. I thought both were great! Their beans are sweet with lots of black pepper (note: they use a lot of black pepper in their sides). I enjoyed their coleslaw as I'm pretty picky when it comes to my 'slaw, but I forget now what it tasted like. Sorry! Today I tried their Green Beans, and they were good--a hint of sweetness and black pepper, and maybe some vinegar? I was impressed with their mac and cheese because most places overcook their pasta. Their macaroni was perfect and the cheese sauce was nice and creamy. It was easy to tell that they use Velveeta (V). I know many people like their mac with V, but I'm not one of those. So, if you like the V, you will love their mac and cheese. If you're not a fan of the V, skip it.Their Potato Salad was probably my least favorite item on their menu. I just didn't like the flavors. Maybe a lot of dill? Whatever it is, I don't dig it. Lastly, let's talk about value. TBS has some amazing prices. I was shocked today when I ordered the Rib Platter for $6.99. It comes with 3 ribs (it doesn't sound like much, but they had a lot of meat on them and I was full), 2 sides and either a roll or cornbread. And the Sampler Platter comes with 3 different meats, 2 sides and either a roll or corn bread for $7.99. Seriously--I pay that at fast food restaurants! When it comes to outstanding food, great service and super value--TBS is a cut above the rest. If you haven't been to TBS, then get your derrière there now. I will be a fan for life even when I move away. Now my question is: do they ship? :-PP.S. Make sure you get the cornbread. Trust me!!!"}, {"review_id": "sKJZHnkVbj2hrc5QXkdk7A", "user_id": "FV_ry_NBYCEwOSME_owqvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/5/2017", "text": "This place is amazing!

My husband rarely bowls over with enthusiasm for bbq but he sure did today. He practically inhaled his Bang BBQ sandwich it was so good. 3 hours later and he's still oohing over it. My Mac Daddy trio was just as good. Everything tasted fresh and like bits of bbq heaven. The pulled pork slider had just a smidgen of heat which I normally dislike but the overall taste was delectable. I don't know how but one Friday I will taste the ribs. Probably have to call out of work but it will happen. I've always thought this place was permanently closed because every time I went by it was closed. I just didn't get there at their 4 hour window. Most definitely a place to visit.Ps, I had the brisket slider the  next day. I nuked it for about 45 seconds and it was the best brisket I've ever had!
