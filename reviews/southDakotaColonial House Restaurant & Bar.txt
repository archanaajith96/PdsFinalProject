Love the cinnamon rolls, I don't even care the collective calories probably take years off my life. They are that good. I haven't been here in years but I really like the remodel. I hope that equates to more business. These guys deserve it.The dine-in food isn't something to write home about, but you can always rely on consistency. The servers are really friendly as well. Now that Food Dude's delivers for these guys I hope it opens up more channels for revenue.If you're visiting and looking for a great breakfast/lunch, this is your spot."}, {"review_id": "gTeV42hOlMBPWxe5OXOD2g", "user_id": "Y09WsE8LMvOHN7AtQGPcxA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "We weren't sure where to go for dinner when we were visiting the area when we came across this place.  The place had a number of stellar reviews so we thought we would give it a try.  Not sure if it was time of day or what, but the place was pretty empty when we got there shortly after six and just seemed to continue to empty out.  The service was good and the service was ok.  I'm not quite sure what I missed that had all of these people giving five star reviews, but I would say a four at the outside best."}, {"review_id": "vMV0fhHVh4Ak3VFF6rBooA", "user_id": "XqizmoY58J0Tu_EWkLAvgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Great food.  Fast and friendly service.  Greatly enjoyed the vegetable frittata and was not able to finish it.  The caramel pecan french toast is also good, but I would order a side of bacon with that to cut the sweetness as I am not a huge sweetness fan."}, {"review_id": "EZoQJH6Gq0xOf-sHvQd_HA", "user_id": "6u42FWZ-Az4LaxOUZ7BZSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "This was absolutely a wonderful place to eat!

Walking in, I saw the interiors were wood panel with some interesting posters hung up. Both booth and table seating were available and plentiful, given the restaurant's large size.I was an immediate fan of their bread; so deliciously soft with just the right amount of salt on it. I even asked them for some to go after the meal.The menu offered a soup and salad combination which I thought was very considerate, particularly since I wasn't super hungry.  BF got the steak and mashed potatoes, which he also enjoyed thoroughly.  We also stared at the dessert case for a while, but we decided that we were too full.  Service was great, and the meal was fantastic."}, {"review_id": "U3U1Cu1R8-W1uNsPrMWnjA", "user_id": "CShGx-a9o_g7FxXKCkT6bg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "Where do I start?We stopped here for breakfast on our last day in Rapid City.Let's start with parking...small front parking, but ample spaces in the back. Upon first glance of the menu, it appears that each individual meal is made for 3 people to share. Haha. The portion sizes are huge and the menu is full of American Staples and local twists. If you're looking to eat healthy for breakfast, this is NOT the place. When the food actually came to the table it was hot, fresh and came fast. But, there was really nothing special about it. Would I recommend this place? Sure, but what you get is what you get...country style home cooking."}, {"review_id": "4eQznL05RTEveOENQpbJDw", "user_id": "Je-UcIbxoeRlBDO7M0N96g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "Solid breakfast spot!  Excellent customer service, clean, family friendly, and great good.  Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "SDNvL8FWW7Dz19vsyYrP4Q", "user_id": "a6HLH8HApzr-0i2kEFb5cQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/23/2016", "text": "In my opinion, this a Chotchkie's type chain restaurant. (TGI Friday's, Applebee's, Chili's, Black Eyed Pea) Substitute any of those & it would basically be the same place.  I ordered the Spitfire Chicken Pasta, plus a side salad.After reading the description, I wasn't expecting it to be served with sour cream & guacamole.  I could only eat about half of it before the flavors became unsettling. I would not order this again.  My wife chose the daily special, Buffalo Ribeye, with soup & baked potato. The steak was tough & chewy. She enjoyed the soup most of all. Our waitress was attentive & helpful. We noticed there seemed to be several regular customers, which would explain why this place has so many high marks."}, {"review_id": "9iuoViafRyKRxx4TCSZeYQ", "user_id": "XS6BZP7JwKUERqtXiWxxJw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/10/2015", "text": "Reminds me of a Cracker Barrel...it had great Yelp reviews when I looked for a breakfast joint.  Parking was packed, with folk pouring out of the doors waiting, so I figured that was a good sign.  I put my name in for a 20-minute wait.  The waiting room is small, but it was HOT, so best to be in my car, cooling.  But I remember this from a time ago, the buzzer doesn't work in the car.  Sigh.  I'll go stand and wait.Approximately 15 minutes later, I was seated in a place where I could people-watch.  : )  They gave me a dinner menu, but I'd come for breakfast.  Could I help it if I was waiting?  They honored by request for breakfast and I had the country fried steak and eggs.  Delish!  While everything was hot, everything was good.  Country fried steak could have been more tender, but it was good.  Sausage gravy was good until it congealed.  Over medium eggs were good.  Potatoes ended up being more like potato chips.  But alas, I was full.  i really wanted to try the bacon, and try a dessert, but I was full.I watched folk for a while.  The bar that seats 4 folk is awfully cozy.  The wares near the register didn't get touched much, but seems like lots of folk ordered pastries to go.  I was still too full for that.  But that salted caramel hit the last spot!"}, {"review_id": "gt6FjAEdDlbufZK09RwalA", "user_id": "pktAtP9igSbtY3ZcjV40PA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/15/2017", "text": "This the the go-to spot for great food in Rapid City!  Their menu is extensive, from appetizers to sandwiches, salads, and burgers to pork chops, steaks and chicken.

Seating was quick, food tasted good, I had pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon. I was happy to finally get a decent cup of coffee, the place we have been staying at has super nasty coffee (ick!). Food took a little longer to come out then I would've liked, and the waitress didn't come around very often to check on us. I don't recall her stopping by the table until after the food arrived, even then it was only like once.

Ordered a 5 cheese pasta, smoked brisket off the special menu, a chicken fried buffalo steak off the special menu, and a garlic chicken pasta. All food was yummy, however most forks were going into my son's 5 cheese pasta. The smoked brisket was a little on the fatty side, lots of pieces I couldn't eat. Service was really good. The only downside was that it was hard to find a dessert that was in stock.

For instance I ordered the ham and cheese omelette because it was the closest to a denver omelette but it was really lacking crunch and depth of flavor. A nicely cooked omelette but one-note flavors. Almost all the menu items seemed that way.

First the bowl. We got the regular size and it was a solid sized portion plus the toast. The pasta itself was average but the veggies with the pasta is what made this dish. There's lots of veggies that add color and depth to the dish. Its a solid vegetarian option.Second, the burger. Again solid sized burger with a satisfying amount of French fries. I believe the burger patty is house made. I can't verify that but it looks like that way. Made of quinoa and some other ingredients I couldn't decipher. But it was pretty tasty with the pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, Swiss cheese, mushrooms, and guac. By the way, it's not on the dinner menu, but just ask your waiter/tress and they should be able to get it for you.Also, solid root beer and cinnamon roll.Definitely good option for you veggies out there. Most of menu does have meat, but the vegetarian options are gems.Looks like they have a good breakfast menu so I'll come by again."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/colonial-house-restaurant-and-bar-rapid-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
