Don't let the fact that it's attached to a gas station deter you. It's all authentic Indian food, and extremely delicious. Seriously ever dish is fresh and delicious. Just watch the spice leave, it can get quite spicy. The owner Raj is amazing and so polite, when we first entered the restaurant we were greeted with smiles and seated right away. It was a few days before Christmas and it wasn't too busy. We ordered our food and got to know the owner Raj a little more, turns out not only is he the chef and owner but he dabbles in smoking meats. He had just smoked a variety of meat and brought us tasty samples. It was delicious and as we complimented him on his meat he got excited and showed us his smoker setup in the back. Us being from out of state and smoking connoisseurs our selves talked about different techniques he could try and use. He was greatly appreciative because he's a vegetarian and never tries his creations. He had invited us back a few days later before we left town to try his smoked ribs. But he had an emergency and was not available. My brother and his wife live in Fort Smith so we will definitely be back. Keep up the great food, and see you next time Raj. :)"}, {"review_id": "UosbsR5O38wK_AZz6-YGkw", "user_id": "IbgctjNTyxQc78PBVSKT7Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "This place is pretty freaking good! I ordered a mango lassi and a #14 with the mixed veggies and it came with a side of rice and naan.    The lassi was very rich and thick which was a plus for me. Usually, I run through 2 of those by the time I finish my food but here I just needed the one.      I also really enjoyed my mixed veggies and rice as well as the portion. My food was served hot and had a lot of flavor with the right amount of spice for me.    The naan on the other hand was bleh. It was not bad but I wouldn't care to order the plain one as a side. The next time I come here I am going to order the garlic naan and see if that's any better."}, {"review_id": "JiT9Emfxjs266W6xhxGlaw", "user_id": "e9-ETOPoCXmnvjukCWJ6vw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "We went as a party of four about Three in the afternoon. The restaurant was decorated beautifully and seemed average on cleanliness. The food was delivered on time. The waitress was knowledgeable and the food was delicious. The only thing that could have been better was the attentiveness of the waitress. She was very preoccupied with her cell phone sitting at the end of the bar on a low bench or something out of sight of our table.   When I needed coffee refilled and when we need our check, it was an exercise in patience."}, {"review_id": "oW0cnq0M4nQdaAcjp79jcg", "user_id": "gNJN2p4cMDKaI5ujwe8pNQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/7/2017", "text": "While on a business trip, I stopped for gas and once I got out of my car, I could smell the most delicious aroma of Indian food. To the right of the gas station there was the R & R Curry Express, I had to stop in for a quick lunch. The inside of the restaurant is decorated very festive. I was greeted and seating and told  the specials of the day.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Marsala, it was served with basmati rice and naan bread. You can ordered your Marsala mild to extra spicy. My order came out sizzle hot, with large pieces of tender chicken breast in a very tasty Marsala sauce. The rice and freshly made naan bread was delicious. I'm looking forward to my next visit to R & R Curry."}, {"review_id": "Z5WM5PlawBBA17YHi2FDhA", "user_id": "Fe-AC_A4kqjxY3TJbo4pbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "Chicken Masala is amazing!

I grew up eating Indian food with close friends and was really excited to move to a place with an Indian restaurant. However, their popularity astounds me. It has to be because they're an anomaly amongst Asian food choices. Or because everyone orders the same thing.

This place is always busy at meal times and for good reason. I always stop here if I'm even close to Ft.  Smith for work. I'll drive from I-40 just to get it to go and then get back in the road. Every time I've been here the food is cooked to perfection! They don't skip a beat. The only gripe I could possibly have is the we're out of rice pudding this time around. But it was late in the day so that's understandable. The chicken curry is my absolute favorite as well as my wife's. Be sure to check this place out even if you don't usually like Indian food.

I recommend the samosa chaat (not on the menu) $5 and mango lassi ($3). Flattened samosa with onion, tomato, cilantro, chickpeas, potato, and topped with 2 tangy and sweet sauces. it's suppose to be an appetizer but it's pretty filling. Mango lassi is a mango piña colada type twist topped with hazelnut. I also get the paneer and chicken tikka masala. Not a huge fan of their cheese naan because it's a bit on the skimpier portion size. I love my spicy food but their spicy is on the weak side IMO. Cute, quiet, little place to go to and their service is great!"}, {"review_id": "BbnrLVDzVPLHY6jiwZh7pQ", "user_id": "q55pXTK0Z1i6MdPaEjEOsQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2017", "text": "Great food!
