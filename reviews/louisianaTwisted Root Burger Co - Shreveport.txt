The moment that you walk in you get the feeling that this is going to be a good place to eat (which was definitely the case). Everything is decorated and the ambience makes you feel at home, if home is like a rock/party house! The wait staff were very helpful and interesting we are not even the other patrons. I think it was obvious to them that we were tourists/not from around these parts and they wanted to help us with our experience. This probably is one of the first times that even patrons joined in with the dining experience.  They were very happy to share locations and tourist sites and even some locals only establishments (will hit those on our next trip). The food was nothing short of delicious. They had to specials that day one was rabbit and the other was Buffalo, so of course I had to rabbit and the other two guys had Buffalo.  All I can say is, we became fans immediately! Everything was cooked to perfection (not overcooked it all) and the flavor was totally there. There are a couple locations in Shreveport and will try the other one on our next trip. Yes, we recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "YS6fNgW07EhKESxXahEPZg", "user_id": "ZENOg0mwI-QHhGAmrppdpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "This place is so much fun! If I lived here, I would literally come once a week. When you walk in and wait in line, the two walls on both sides are filled with fun stickers with different sayings on them. When you place your order, they give you a celebrity's name. If you have to wait to hear that name to know your order is ready. They also have an outdoor seating area and a small kids playground outside.It's a cool looking place, great vibes, and good food. I love how spacious and open it feels. I don't ever feel cramped. My table had a guitar in it too! They have rolls of towels at each table so you can dig into your food and clean up after yourself. I love everything about this place!"}, {"review_id": "eVc96GGVO-lj2PA-QBzT-Q", "user_id": "ZwhsYp2xNrg0kc6u69RITw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I ordered a vegetarian burger with fries. I requested hot fries bc I noticed a bowl of fries sitting in the kitchen prep area. The cashier acknowledged that she heard my request but she kinda had an attitude. Burger and fries came and fries were cold. I asked for hot fries but didn't get them for abt 10 minutes. They were over fried. Looked like they were refried!

If I could find anything to suggest to them it would be find a way to make the burgers a little less greasyyyy. It made them almost a mess, not quite soggy but just falling apart.

The burger was $20! And I would have been disappointed if it was $10. Asked for sauce on side it was served on burger. Burger was lacking seasoning. Garlic mushrooms were ok didn't notice any garlic flavor. Also they seem to be a little stingy with toppings. Pineapple salsa was good just wished there was more. Added an egg and it was cooked right. Onion rings were decent. Another disappointment is only two exotic meats that rotate every week. Wish I would have known that. Came in and buffalo and venison were the two choices. Not exactly exotic. Had the venison. At least it wasn't dry.  The cashier was a nice dude. Nice place but for the price I paid there should be a waitress picking up the trash and refilling drinks."}, {"review_id": "Ts184Mtq74a9gdwyKJva5g", "user_id": "hLt-plzvszhdspHJ3FbM5A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2016", "text": "Twisted Root has a great ambience and atmosphere-probably one of the best in Shreveport.  The back of the restaurant is open air, there's a huge bar and it's entertaining to listen as the orders are called for pickup based on the names of actors, singers,  classic TV characters and random pop culture icons that were assigned to you as you place your order (Like- J.R. Ewing, Marge Simpson, Sting, Buzz Aldrin etc...).  The ordering concept is one that seem to be growing in popularity.  Basically it's a custom made burger.  You pick the meat - everything from standard beef, to bison, venison, elk etc...You pick the buns, toppings etc.  There are some standard burgers on the menu to choose from but I would imagine that most people create their own.  My main complaint is that the burgers were not as good as I hoped they'd be.  They were on the thin side and a little dry and I really thought it would be a big, juicy patty.  They do have a full pickle bar to choose from and mix and match every kind of picke that exists and that was kind of cool if you're a picke fan.  Plus they also are known for their adult liquor infused milk shakes which are always a fun concept."}, {"review_id": "kJh1qeABKiS1Rn4smAcLuQ", "user_id": "9wcvnotPib_ioTbcAy7i0A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Veggie burger fell apart and should be called veggie platter.

No longer will you have to seek mediocre fast food burgers. For a refreshing change, feast your eyes and stomach on a Twisted Root burger. Twisted Root delivers a solid burger in a casual, relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Service was friendly during our dining experience. Oh and the rock & roll theme had me wishing Bon Jovi or Journey were jamming here, but a girl can dream, can't she?!Here's the low down: get in line, decide between one of their specialty burgers or BYOB (build your own burger), order at the counter, and then grab your seat. If you're in the mood for sides or shakes then by all means, splurge and go for it! The fried green beans were surprisingly tasty compared to the run-of-the-mill fries. Oh and after ordering, you'll get a nifty name card letting you know what name to listen for when your food is ready for pickup (yes, you can pretend to be a celebrity for the time being haha). While you're waiting for your food, you can quench your thirst by trying out the watermelon tea, homemade root beer, or get the party started with something from their nice selection of craft beers. They offer a complimentary pickle bar- pick your pickle flavor of choice or try them all! Homemade sauces (ancho-chipotle ketchup, horseradish dijon, BBQ) are available at each table too.The mushroom burger we ordered was made more amazing because of the fried egg! You haven't truly reached burger nirvana until you add that fried egg to seal the deal! The bacon cheeseburger was tasty as well. Taste wise, both burgers were hot, juicy, fresh and well-seasoned. Prices are above average but you're paying for an above average burger!  If you're feeling adventurous, they even offer unique meats like buffalo or elk, depending on availability.Definitely consider Twisted Root for lunch, happy hour or watching sports games. Their bar setup is pretty cool and they have a full bar. Ok, now go enjoy a delish burger (and possibly a drink or two) like the rockstar that you are!!!"}, {"review_id": "-q_XsknGkvoYz0hysGJi1g", "user_id": "yju-gefwKXjSUXc6-A6eoA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/29/2017", "text": "The selections are varied and fun to try out.

Wasn't all that optimistic, honestly, about the prospects for something head turning in Shreveport. But I was pleasantly surprised. Thanks to some good reviews on Yelp - I took a chance on this place and am an instant fan. Love the look and atmosphere - open, lots of light, upbeat, trendy, good music that's loud enough to enjoy but quiet enough so that you can actually talk to people - imagine that! Love the food - its a hamburger place - albeit a \"top shelf\" one. If you want steak or sushi - go somewhere else. If you want a standard food - hamburgers - raised to a whole new level with creativity and craft - this is your place. There are other things on offer - but clearly gourmet burgers is their mojo. I had the \"Big Tex\" - very nice. They offer local craft beers and standards - overall a solid bar that avoids the extreme lower and upper ends you find in other places. Service is excellent.
