You go in there feeling like you're in your grandparents old VFW with ratty chairs and everything is old. But it is SO good. And so cheap. and so fun. A pitcher of beer at Matt's and a Jucy Lucy is one of my favorite things to do. It's a MUST! It can get super busy, so if you can go during the day time hours on a weekday, it's more relaxing.

There was a small line but I didn't mind because I have heard all about the long wait and lines that people usually encounter at Matt's Bar.I am not a dive bar person, but I can try one in order to check off a Minneapolis staple on my \"to try list.\"We each ordered a Jucy Lucy and a half order of fries to share. The fries were over done and I wouldn't order them again.When our Jucy Lucy's arrived the waiter told us to wait before biting into our Burgers and I am glad she did so. Once I bit into the burger I took my time to take in the flavor and luckily didn't get burned. I was, however, taken a back by the amount of oil that oozed out of the Patty before I saw the cheesey goodness everyone talks about. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed my Jucy Lucy but it was quite heavy and oily. At least I got to try it."}, {"review_id": "KGIyovO_h57OP0Xfbg4Clw", "user_id": "P0PXmmXT_CkpSVxcfIEvFw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "We had to check out all the hype about their famous Jucy Lucy!

Come at me, 5-8'ers! (or don't, please.)Matt's Bar is casual and straight-forward, no frills, and gives 0 F's... I love it. The place is small, pretty divey, and cash only, but you bet your ass you're going to wait in line, hit up the ATM, get charged a fee, and you're going to like it. My usual: Jucy Lucy with extra cheese on top, plus fried onions and extra pickles, with fries and a Summit on the side. And they don't play around when you ask for extra pickles! Wait a couple minutes before you bite into a big ol' JL, because the cheese inside is scalding. Plus it makes for a better photo if you wait until it's thickened up a bit. Matt's Jucy Lucy is THE most perfect, greasy, meaty, cheesy delight this side of the Mississippi. It's so simple yet complex. The faint of heart (stomach) might want to clear that calendar after scarfing back a few, if you know what I mean. #worthit"}, {"review_id": "eGb7WdjkfLH6ouA7T_48dw", "user_id": "uoIOPb99-PoG-h71yDta5A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Be prepared to wait in a long line for a table!

I ordered a can of Coca-Cola, a Jucy Lucy (duh) and split fries with a friend. I was hesitant to try the Jucy Lucy as a lot of the reviews say it's over-hyped, but I LOVED it. Honestly, the cheese oozed out in every bite and, even though I wish there was lettuce or other toppings, the burger's flavor, despite the simplicity, is what makes the Jucy Lucy so great. We came at 2:30 pm on a snowy Saturday and still had to start our wait outside the doors. Once inside you can see this is not a place for large groups- our group of 8 split up 4/4 so we could be seated easily. If you haven't tried Matt's Bar yet, you should definitely put it on your list!Note: Cash only!

It's a simple place with a simple menu, which I appreciate. But there is nothing simple about the food. If you go, you have to get the Juicy Lucy and fries, I would shame you if you didn't. They are both AMAZING. The Juicy Lucy was so Juicy it legit squirted all over my boyfriends sweatshirt! It melts in your mouth when you bite down and with the combo of fries, you can't go wrong. Also, can we talk about the price?!?! SO CHEAP! That's what I like $7 for Juicy Lucy and $5 for a HUGE basket of fries!

Absolutely the best juicy lucy I've tried in town so far! As a dive bar, Matt's really holds true to it's personality; small, cozy, cheap, simple menu, etc., and executes it very well. If I didn't have to wait about 20 minutes to sit and could have the convenience of bringing my credit card, I'd give this a 5 star review. A few tips and things to now: cash only, the cheese is REAL HOT on the first bite, and oozes out a lot, tax is included in the price, and expect a wait when you come. Street parking will be your best bet, and you may have to wait in line out the door. Also, don't bother getting the hamburger, just get the juicy lucy.

Needless to say, my expectations were high. We arrived at 3pm to try to avoid the crowds. Yeah, that didn't work. It seemed like a memo went out to all the Eagles fans in town. We waited an hr surrounded by them, shivering in the cold. When you get inside, all the white bro energy kinda smacks you in the face, ha. We finally got seated, but then were asked to share our table with 2 Philly guys who proceeded to tell me all about football and how great Philadelphia is. I let their words bounce off me as I only cared about my burger at this point. The juicy lucy was pretty good but the oozing cheese was over-powered by the onions. My bun was also slightly cold and the burger itself was fairly small. Server was efficient and nice, which was especially impressive given the crazy crowds. Overall, don't believe all the hype, though it's still worth trying MN's signature burger at least once. Just try to go with less of a wait and with more Vikings fans!"}, {"review_id": "o3mkY-VgMe_GOKnVVlrVcA", "user_id": "2pZpmACSCR19M5mY4Cq6lA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "It's in a weird suburban location, looks like a dive bar, but they serve a mean Juicy Lucy! $7.50 for the burger, get yourself a basket of fries, and they have sodas and beers.

Whether or not this is truly its place of origin, I don't know, but I don't really care since I had an awesome experience here. Expect a very casual diner/dive bar, with no ice and no plates. Cash only, and only a handful of things on their menu - typical bar food, I'd add. The Jucy Lucy was perfect, and I had to be careful not to burn my mouth on the hot, oozing cheese! The fries were thin and crispy and just what I needed - and the portion size is HUGE (half order is more than enough for one person). I'll definitely be back!

They left an outdoor heater which kept us warm. Staff selling merchandise near the door were nice. Multiple cops were on foot chasing a suspect through the neighborhood. A horde of Philly Eagles fans in line with us cheered.Once we got in through the jail cell like door, there was a short line in the landing area.10-15 minutes in, we made it inside to join another line. Staff were direct and accommodating. We got a table after 30 mins.This one group of Philly Eagles fans was too large (tables only seat 4) so two from their group ended up joining our table. We didn't have much of a choice. They struggled to keep profanity out of their sentences which was entertaining to observe. Conversation was friendly but mostly centered around NFL, football, Philadelphia, history of the Eagles, the McNabb era, Chris Carter, more on the Eagles and Carson Wentz and Nick Foles, and a touch of Fran Tarkenton and the Vikings.This is a cash only place BUT the menu prices included tax which was refreshing. Got a Left Hand Nitro Milk Stout. The Eagles fans were looking sadly at their MGD. They chugged it and ordered what I had. We finally found a topic we agreed on - light beer is terrible and stouts rock, especially Left Hand Nitro Milk Stout. They insisted that Yeungling made the best beer however.An hour and half since we got there, the $7.50 Juicy Lucy arrived. The two guys probably felt bad after seeing my expression. They offered to pay our meal. We argued against it but they insisted. We made one more attempt to pay the tab but they were adamant and took the receipt. Eagles fans don't take no for an answer.

This is the quintessential midwest, hole-in-the-wall local bar spot. It's on a very unassuming corner and if it hadn't gotten press coverage on Food Wars (among others), I'm sure it would've remained a Local's Secret for a very long time.It's a simple, shot gun style joint with a handful of servers and one dude behind the bar, cooking the Jucy Lucy's. Service...was slow. Painfully slow. It took forever to order, forever to get our food and forever to get our check. (We ordered 2 Jucy Lucy's, a Large Fry and a Coke.) The menu itself is pretty modest, but then again the whole vibe of this place is laid back. Was the Jucy Lucy worth it? Absolutely. (Just make sure you let the burger cool before taking a bite because that cheese is MOLTEN.) The fries are shoestring style and super addictive! If you're looking for a wider variety of Jucy Lucy's you've got to check out their \"Competitor,\" which is closer to the airport/Mall of America and is more a restaurant vibe than a bar. But for what felt like a true Minneapolis bar for late night food, this definitely did the trick for me!"}, {"review_id": "2Ohfro2ztzjWfu7J8k-5FA", "user_id": "b_YS3bIajrMmMFqun_PAHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Matt's Bar delivers the famous Jucy Lucy and a simple, straightforward menu with cold drinks.

Ok, I don't have the creative energy to write the rest of the review like that, but let me tell you that this place is well worth a visit anytime. The menu is simple and so is the choice - a Juicy Lucy right at the top. Fried or raw onions and pickles can also be added to a burger. This visit was my first to Matt's and I originally ordered just one JL but ordered a second as soon as I finished the first. A full order of fries is big enough for two or three people to share, which is good because if you're willing to share, then you have more room for JLs!One waitress ran the whole place when I was there on Sunday night.

I did not have a chance to try anything else on the menu.One bite takes you into heavenly cheesy meaty goodness. I would definitely eat this more often if it was available in California.

This place is a all wooden tavern with a tiny grill in the front with an equally small deep frier next to it. Don't judge this place by the size, as they produce a tasty Jucy Lucy for just above $7. The fries are huge and enough to split four ways, so order wisely. Get a Grain Belt beer because it is local are represents a true \"working man's\" beer.
