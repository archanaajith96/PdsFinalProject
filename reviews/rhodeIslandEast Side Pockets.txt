I had problem only with the chicken which I see is usually not supposed to be as bad, so might try it one more time."}, {"review_id": "1yWQ8Yw9dICmiIDE1yrVQA", "user_id": "5ctu-O-T2OeozZTCzbv47A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Love East Side Pockets for a light lunch.

I know that's a funny way to describe a family run business on Thayer Street, but trust me, you will find some of the most delicious middle eastern \"fast food\" anywhere in Rhode Island her- so good in fact, that my grandparents (who are from Lebanon) will eat and enjoy the falafel or kefta wraps when I bring them over (after scolding me for paying for food they can whip up at a moments notice) While I've had just about everything on the menu, my favorites are the falafel and the chicken wraps. Each wrap is made to order right in front of you and they can add all of your favorite veggies and toppings. What's really great is this place is open late, so any time you have a craving for some delicious, fresh, high quality food at a reasonable price you can come here. Seating is limited during peak times even though they have several booths, a few stools, and a few tables outside too. Pro tips:No need to wait in line if you're ordering an \"express item\" like their 6 piece falafel which comes with bread, hummus, and yogurt dipping sauces - just walk to the register and order it there  No matter what you order, be sure to pick up the middle eastern sampler platter to go and take it to work with you the next day for lunch. I guarantee you every co-worker that walks past you will stop and comment on how delicious it looks, to which you will respond \"I know!\""}, {"review_id": "981KYmtzbc5HuMBzUTt-Sw", "user_id": "1gpZXnZhfVYkKjWZXA7FzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "I'm impressed. My $7.50 gyro pocket with everything was legitimately one of the best Middle Eastern items I've tried and -- trust me -- as a broke grad student in Manhattan I've had quite a few.The gyro meat (lamb, I'm pretty sure) was sliced thick, warm, and seasoned well without being too salty. Then there were heaps of vegetables with all sorts of sauces that didn't feel heavy at all. Also, the pita wrap is big! I'd hold the banana peppers next time; they tasted somewhat out of place.Nice staff, swift service, ample seating and a bathroom."}, {"review_id": "Wr50tpElHe8Puy8i1dIb7w", "user_id": "pN7qHvZUKtVzwFfWx65-4A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/14/2017", "text": "If you had told me 10, 8 5, 2 years ago that I would have eaten Greek food, and enjoyed it, I would have laughed, bet against it, said you didn't know me. I don't know what came over myself, maybe I've aged, maybe I was excited Gster was in town, maybe I just had too long of a lunch break. But wow, am I glad that I wasn't thinking clearly that day.We went during lunch, so obviously the line was super long. Being my first exposure to this type of food, I was overwhelmed with what to order. I got a chicken wrap, with cucumber sauce, lettuce, and tabuloah. The serving is MASSIVE, enough for at least 2 meals. The flavors are poignant, surprising, but combines greatly. I ate it, I survived, and guess what... I already have been back! When I came back the second time with Patch, I pulled a classic \"kim\". When asked if we had been there before, I excitedly answered \"yes!\", and when Patch said no, I started to call him out, since he formerly went to BC ( Bryant College) and considered himself a RI local and frequented ESP. Well, my honesty almost cost us 2 falafals! I can now officially say I have also tried falafel and hummus, and scarily enough, kind of (secretly) enjoyed them. There's a whole new world opened up to me, thanks to ESP!

A lot of people take their food to go, so we had no problem getting one of the booths.My one complaint is that the pita wrap itself is kind of tough. I wish they freshened it somehow before serving. On the other hand, it holds the falafel and salads stuffed inside well, without falling apart. I always get everything except for raw onion. We also got fries this time. One small order of curly fries was enough to share among 3 people. We asked for them extra crispy. It's the best falafel around."}, {"review_id": "0GSCGZsIVzGWbEuJ9opqMg", "user_id": "Lb-arR1xRwKSmoi4b3Pdag", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "I've loved coming here since I was a teenager.

Now my grown ass has traveled far and wide, had many falafels and only 1 even came close to the perfection of the ESP version. Now I've branched out and tried other items on the menu - the platters & plates are such a good deal for the price.
