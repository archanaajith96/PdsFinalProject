I ordered chow menu with steak and my husband ordered the yellow curry with shrimp.  Our food came out quick and it was hot.   The ingredients are fresh and it was delicious.  They have great customer service and check to make sure you enjoyed your meal.  We loved it!  We will definitely be returning to this restaurant."}, {"review_id": "xWrPsIxUNp1WVtrEEqAzoA", "user_id": "D6aP-CKpeU9-4PWfXMMnUA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "I ordered the spicy noodles with beef. Dish is really yummy. I ordered it a 3 which is what I normally do. 3 wasn't at all spicy. But every Thai place is different. He beef was super chewy but decent flavor. Boyfriend got the same dish with chicken and the chicken was great. I would say the fried shrimp are a must. So good! The crab puffs are also amazing. Love that there is onion! Really good overall! Just sad about the beef and the spice but now I know! Also good on price."}, {"review_id": "d_omvtoSUL7z1_rSN8Vk_Q", "user_id": "qGHaT6P4Gs4GnFHZSheNNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Despite the minor confusion of self seating..Friendly staff, fast service & inexpensive food delectably proportioned!"}, {"review_id": "cFDSnMxisl6x2fMJh4n8og", "user_id": "it7s6RAH3hcPyW0RCRaDAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I got the pad Thai & basil fried rice, both with beef!The basil fried rice was very good and I would definitely order again! The pad Thai was good, but not my thing...I haven't had it before, but it looked good in the pictures, so I got it! Just wasn't something I personally would order again cause I'm not crazy about the sweetness of it!

It's similar to a family style serving and plenty for two to share. It came with a fluffy white jasmine rice.I had the #54 Yellow Curry Noodle with chicken. The chicken was thinly sliced and tender within the dish. The squash was the perfect consistency somewhat al dente & a better option ( in my opinion) than potato. Creamy coconut milk, Rich flavorful curry that I requested medium. \"Do it\" They will bring extra chili sauce to the table, so it was a perfect offering as you can add more heat if you wish!In speaking with our server Tommy, the family has 5 locations including - New Mexico & California ( In Hollywood). Each location is family owned &  operated. Everything is made in house. Orange chicken is made from scratch. All the authentic dishes are also made fresh daily! My Curry was absolutely delicious! I left there completely satisfied with the portion sizes & price.We will definitely be repeat customers & I highly recommend that you try this place out."}, {"review_id": "xFyj1kWAFYSHYeuNoMGaxQ", "user_id": "OE25CJ_J7qnvW9e2EJCpUw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Never dissatisfied with this place.

Excellent management. Wonderful coconut soup, but be sure to pick out the lemongrass, Bayleaf, and ginger root as they are quite tough to chew. These spring rolls and Pad thai were excellent and they even had green jasmine tea! My only suggestion would be since pad Thai sauce is very very sweet, I ask for that on the side next time."}, {"review_id": "MxXTUTzc2QHWgfMIFtNSfA", "user_id": "v0lzz3wY8ujy-f0Lhn9YwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "I am a thai food aficionado, and tried this retaurant during a recent visit to Mesa.

My dad and I came on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately and the service was super fast!  Right when we chose our seat they came to our table asking for our drinks. But what caught me more off guard was the fact that the food came out maybe less than 10 minutes after we ordered. My dad ordered a house special dish and I ordered the Pad see Eiw. I thought that we ordered our own dish, but when a server came up she put our dishes in the middle and gave us smaller plates to serve ourselves on, but I guess that's just how they run their restaurant! Another thing that surprised me was the price of their items. Dishes are generally under $10 and I felt like I found the best hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant in the area considering I was from out of town. I definitely got the bang for my buck"}, {"review_id": "yZ5PyRRi2pE1N1BNiHHx5w", "user_id": "Hgh8Kd767pnB_0chdcs0Rw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "Have ordered take-out here a few times...but today was the first time for dining in.The first thing to note is that no one is overly friendly.  They're not rude...but don't expect any small talk.We were greeted by \"how many?\"...and then simply waved to a nearby table.  A family came in after us and one of the men was in good spirits and said with a big smile on his face, \"Long time no see.\" The host just intoned, \"How many?\" and acted just like he had to us.OK...so you're not going to Thai Plates to make friends it seems.We each ordered our new \"go-to\" Thai meal: Spicy Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) w/ chicken (called Drunken Noodles at many places - with basil and vegetables).As I've written in many reviews we like hot foods and ordered it Hot...but they offer Extra Hot and several levels of Thai Hot.  Next time we'll both try the Extra Hot...because while the Hot was ok...we like a bit more scorch to our taste buds.  : )Otherwise everything was fresh and cooked just right.  The chicken was tender and there were many large pieces. I thought there were far fewer vegetables than you'd find at other Thai places and missed that though.The price is pretty good at $8.50 for the entree...but for that you get a bit of a smaller portion.  I had a Thai tea which was ok...but I like mine a little stronger and sweeter.  Like a lot of smaller Thai restaurants they only offer soda in a can for a dollar.Over-all we thought it was pretty good and would definitely go back.BTW...we got there after they just opened at 11am on a Monday...and by 12:30 every seat in the place was filled...so a lot of people must really like it here."}, {"review_id": "P67p0Cq-JMYjGGTWoEuR5Q", "user_id": "-YwDVEfG3pnn3U79fFR-Bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "Wonderful Thai food.
