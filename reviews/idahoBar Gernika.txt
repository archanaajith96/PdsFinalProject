I always come back to the chorizo supreme sandwich. It's just a chorizo sandwich with grilled onions and peppers. There is major spillage with the onions and peppers, but they are delicious on their own. Just a solid sandwich. A lot of people I go with love the lamb grinder, which is a good choice as well.If you go, you have to get the croquetas. Delicious little fried balls of awesome! Add a little tiger sauce and you're good to go!They also have a great variety of rotating beers to choose from. Really enjoy this little basque place.

Even if you're only in Boise for an afternoon, come here.This small restaurant is located on the corner of the Basque block downtown. You know how you always hear that little hole-in-the-wall restaurants have the BEST food? This is no exception. I have worked downtown for over a year and it's the best lunch (and one of the best dinners) I've had, hands down.The croquetas are phenomenal. Crispy on the outside yet creamy and fluffy on the inside, they're decadent and beautifully flavored. The beer selection has a decent variety, and you can get other beverages you won't find many other places (kalimotxo, I'm looking at you).Most sandwiches come with a side of fries, salad, soup, or croquetas. I have gotten the spicy lamb grinder (extra spicy) twice and I think it's my favorite sandwich in town. The au jus is good enough to drink a glass of and the sandwich is big enough to keep a big guy like me full. The first time, I even had to take half home--and I almost never have leftovers to take home.The only downside of this place is that I am not eloquent enough to do it justice."}, {"review_id": "wRA2k_raO6S2LzHAaIGjLA", "user_id": "Vb3yGDoHB4QrdZfHzEf6ig", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "Today I wanted pizza, but the streets department had my fav pizzeria closed because of water main work . :(   I asked Tony, \"where would you eat\", he IMMEDIATELY pointed to this place.  He said , \"it is all homemade\".  (Tony is a stickler for quality, so I was sold)I had the soup .  It was delicious, served with yummy bread (and crackers)  HOT!  it is refreshing to find a place that gives you soup at a temperature that will stay warm until you finish eating. I had the house salad.  The greens were not noteworthy, but the house dressing is worth eating average greens to enjoy!  Get the salad just for the dressing. Our server recommend the croquetas. This is definitely for two people.  One person could not handle that many crunchy , rich, balls of delishisness.!  Maybe even three people.

Since I did a search for \"Au Jus\" a few months back, their Lamb Grinder has been on my mind. Yesterday a friend offered to take me out to lunch (for my bday week, yay!!) and told me to pick somewhere I've been wanting to try. Instantly, I picked Bar Gernika. \"Lamb Grinder and croquetas, I am coming for you,\" was my thought.We had a late lunch (about 2:30), so the place was pretty much empty aside from 3 or 4 other patrons. We sat inside because it was chilly (although on a sunny day I would absolutely opt-in for outside seating, their patio is so cute and provides a great view of downtown). I didn't even have to look at the menu, from reading all of the other Yelp reviews, I knew I wanted to try the Lamb Grinder. But, the respectful thing is to give all the dishes a fair chance and look over the menu, so I did. And my initial plan was thwarted. I decided that I wasn't going to get just a lamb grinder. I was going to get the SPICY lamb grinder. Oh baby, I'm so glad I did.Picture this: a soft roll of bread, topped with tender lamb meat with mounds of onions and jalapenos, topped with melted cheesy heaven and served up with an inconspicuous (but divine) bowl of Au Jus. Filling in the gaps on the plate are 5 little croquetas. Goodness, how does one explain a croqueta?! Our waiter described them as a very simple recipe that requires a lot of love. Apparently, there is ground up chicken in them, but they taste like cheesy fried mashed potato balls...but better than that. I could have eaten a plate full of those bad boys. My only complaint is that they gave me 5 of them...just 5. I guess this is to cause you to savor them. They do, after all, deserve more respect than the average french fry.Our server was very kind and helpful. You could also tell he loved the food that he was sharing with us. He was very knowledgeable about the dishes and enthusiastic about Bar Gernika's menu. Way to represent your restaurant well, sir!"}, {"review_id": "ujqFDkISQ2t6I9Ye3FiZFg", "user_id": "bT04OBDAlUTDlqm5OPNxsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/23/2018", "text": "You heard it here: Best fries in downtown Boise. I just really dig Gernika. The bar is cozy, the beer selection is always stellar (and good wine!) and the menu is unique. I haven't had a bad experience. there aren't many places in dt that I can say that for. A half sandwich and fries is a more than adequate lunch and the whole version a dinner + leftovers. 12/10 would chow down."}, {"review_id": "XYMiGXiLf3PSMEsdjA90Yw", "user_id": "0YI0fA3naGahJHRH6RnDzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "We came here for a quick dinner and some drinks.

I always get a Kalimoxo to drink (red wine and coke) - sounds strange, I know, but it's great! For appetizer, you gotta try the croquettes, and USE the dipping sauce, whatever is called. It adds a sweet/spicy flavor and it's awesome. My favorite item is the Lamb Grinder with a side salad. The meat is juicy and tender, and their house garlic vinaigrette dressing is so good I could drink it!  I always go intending to try something new, but I'm a sucker for what I like and typically stick with that. So, why the 4 stars instead of 5?  I had to take off a star because the last time I went I saw that they store the children's high chair seats in the women's, one person at a time, BATHROOM!  When toilets are flushed, the dirty toilet water is going to fly onto them. Every. Time. So, as much as I love going here, I won't be bringing my 1 year old son with me."}, {"review_id": "lhh9ojr1S3ZNUAYuhIJDsQ", "user_id": "8YaRW6wCKTm12Y87vdOp6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "If only all bar food and fast food were this good.

The article recommended Bar Gernika as the restaurant you should check out in all of Idaho, much less all of Boise. bit.ly/2nD8i21What a great place! It is small and casual. A bar with a stove that turns out great food. If you are not from Idaho (like me) you may be surprised to learn that Boise has the greatest number of Basque people in the United States and that Basque people were among the first residents in Idaho as it achieved statehood in 1890.Going further back the Basque people resided in a region now on the border of France and Spain. The basques had a great deal of independence until 1790 and there remains a strong sense of cultural and political identity as the region has been absorbed and split between Spain and France.All this is more context then you we're probably expecting when you clicked on this review to learn about food and beer!The food is phenomenal and I enjoyed the popular dishes ofCroquetas - bite sized, golden fried exterior, lush, creamy and delicious interior all from the simple ingredients of butter, onion, chicken, flour and milkSolomo sandwich - marinated pork loon with pimentos served on a French rollspicy lamb grinder - slow roasted leg of lamb served with jalapeño and au jusThey have a good selection of craft brews to wash it al down.I loved this place!!!"}, {"review_id": "woNqMuRGfCJdP5SiN4XYTA", "user_id": "yqPW9avITinETBltVfUpjQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "Great place for friends, foods drinks really great and friendly staff.
