It had been over ten years since I darkened the doors of this gem. While flipping through the Arkansas Times best of list that came out this week we decided to drive to the neighborhood as several of our final options were nearby. After making the block and seeing most places packed we came in here and were seated immediately. Great tables by the window allow you to enjoy one of the coolest neighborhoods in Little Rock while people prepare incredible authentic food for you. Started with cheese biscuits which are a staple here. Also tried the appetizer with yucca root and onions and sausage which was excellent and almost reminded us of German dishes. My dining companion got a chicken dish over rice with a salad and I had the shrimp dish which came with the most perfectly cooked veggies ever. I would not be fat if I could make vegetables taste like this at home! All was excellent-fresh ingredients, shrimp cooked to perfection, Amazing sauces and people complete the trifecta here. Looking for something out of the ordinary or trying to keep up the progress from your New Years resolution-you'll be safe here. And if you wanna splurge they have a bar and a dessert menu so rage face is an option as well."}, {"review_id": "6oJJ27YHw-CcKlUQT5M9Zg", "user_id": "A0ZqrZiMDix5HXBar2LcnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Has to be one of the best restaurants in Little Rock for the money! My wife and I are staying in town for a few weeks, so we are eating our way through town.  We had an early dinner at Bossa Nova last Friday night and everything was great.  We started with the Soup Sampler--4 -3oz portions of their homemade soups.  All were in point.  For dinner my wife had the Chicken Crepes and I had the Friday Night Special which was a simmered chicken over black beans and Rice with sautéed Collard Green.  Awesome.  A must see in Little Rock!"}, {"review_id": "Kuwv8OOin7D_aOejrjLBZw", "user_id": "-50lprJ4kZ-XCM1hPU2vqg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "It was good. They had several vegan options. Not really sure the Buddha bowl or the Yakisoba bowl are worth $15 a piece with no extras. The place is pretty big. Next door is Rosalia's Bakery which is owned by the same people. They have several vegan desserts in there. Parking is limited. It is hard to miss the place. It has bright yellow awning with the name on it."}, {"review_id": "StBfwM12_FreoNRrErQqBw", "user_id": "KgDtoAvntrW45_F9iWF41Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "If you're traveling through Little Rock on a Sunday and on the make for healthy food, options are limited to say the least. Fortunately, Bossa Nova is there to satisfy your (mostly) clean-eating urges with an added dash of delightful flavor. On my visits, this quest usually manifests itself in the form of the carne desfiada, which serves up heaps of pulled brisket atop a mound of fresh veggies - all of which is tied together perfectly by the unique sweet onion dressing used sparingly on the dish. When I'm less concerned with health than with indulging my inner foodie, I come for brunch and get the eggs benedict, served on a house-made brioche bun with smoked salmon.In either case, the service is reliably terrific, the food is always delicious and the view of Little Rock's trendy Hillcrest neighborhood is beyond compare. I'm sure it will be that way when you visit, too."}, {"review_id": "1DPSY9XmDmKQPIviuskHkQ", "user_id": "1ohcoRr8mx2k5Cq6Wt8DfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "The good Yelp ratings are deserved!   Cafe Bossa Nova is a rare find in Little Rock, run by well-integrated Brazilian immigrants.   The food is authentic -- affordable by Brazilian standards -- and yummy.   I can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "XZKmfGjOHWPWGNqDAKja9w", "user_id": "Mc-nlh-uBTD_eWfnK-KsLw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "Absolutely love this place! I've been twice and look forward to returning. The tilapia and heart of palms soup is still my favorite of all time, though many of their other soups are also delicious. The prices keep us from going back more often but it's definitely a treat each time. The staff are friendly and responsive (not to mention easy on the eyes), and the space is always clean and inviting."}, {"review_id": "wUCuS-aDW1ToGr2nqMSe3A", "user_id": "Z_8clYC-IkqrfHcTCjzAiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/8/2016", "text": "Gluten Free Review+gluten free noted items on menu+40/50% of menu is gluten free!This place is epically awesome not to mention totally delicious and a unique experience, it's what I love about Little Rock. You can literally pick which cuisine you want any given night, German, Brazilian, Chinese, Japanese etc, it's not just throw together. It's a fully authentic experience from the cheese rolls to the yucca root app that tastes just like potatoes. You also can't go wrong with the caipirinha drink which they have a variety of flavors. Also get some Acai juice to go, super food!First time we had the gluten free cheese bread, yucca root, chicken with rice and beans, and also the salmon cakes. Everything was super delicious and can't wait to go back."}, {"review_id": "jjnib-e_axrmR-S4gxM8fg", "user_id": "1e3QHZ-zqpSPFFS-s_gtuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/2/2017", "text": "Stopped here on my way out of town and wow! Probably the best Brazillian food I have had! Started with a caipirinha, was bursting with flavor.  Pap de pão de queijo was amazing, dough was very light and had a great flavor, hands down beats any restaurant pão de queijo I have had.

Brunch!Came in here this past weekend because I wanted to take my wife out for a nice late breakfast. We found out from a friend that they have Sunday Brunch from 10:30am to 2pm, which is a nice, wide, sleep-in-friendly window.We'd also been told that the french toast (Brazilian-style french toast, that is) was to die for - thick slices of bread, battered in butter and brown sugar, soaked in egg overnight to get that perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture!...Needless to say, we had to try it. And it was exactly as advertised. Not only is it everything we were told, but it's the first time I've ever had French Toast on a baguette-style bread, so the bread itself was very tender and did indeed melt in my mouth, but at the same time the thin crust was almost bowl-like and allowed me to even pick up the toast as I messily devoured it. Speaking of the toast, don't use syrup on it. The flavor of the toast is wonderful and unique - the syrup was syrup, nothing snazzy. The same goes for the eggs that come with it. I had mine scrambled, and they were good, but they were just eggs.Or were they?Be sure to ask for some salsa/hot sauce. We got some of the typical stuff in a bottle, but then they have some hot chile-infused olive oil that comes in a little white genie-lantern looking thing. And that stuff is awesome! Just be careful, a little bit (really little bit) goes a long way! But that sauce spiced up my eggs to well beyond ordinary, and set off the rest of the meal nicely.My wife got the vegetable frittata (omelette, on this menu), and it was *delicious.* Had I not been looking forward to the french toast so much, I would have been very jealous. The spice infused oil was also spectacular on that.It may have been because I was enjoying myself so much, but I actually thought their regular house coffee was possibly the best I've had in town!We will be back, and probably soon, because we skipped the mimosas. Honestly, who goes to brunch and doesn't get a mimosa?"}, {"review_id": "ynZBp0HLMNbcv-8bq2olng", "user_id": "4coPh0w4JCcclfn8-wk2gA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "We've been for dinner, and now we've been for lunch. The overall feeling is that the menu is interesting, but that the whole experience is way overpriced. Service is quick, but both times we ordered items that never came (first cheese bread and second coffee). The food for dinner was okay, we got the soup sampler and some rice and chicken dish but we weren't wowed. We enjoyed our lunch items (Buddha bowl and a chicken sandwich) but again just overpriced. Bottom line - If you're looking for something a little different (but not TOO different) and are willing to pay a bit more, this place isn't bad. Just expect to pay more and maybe have spotty service."}, {"review_id": "iC9Gu1NaK5tS6GA6f9xVpA", "user_id": "FkYaLlOcGMgC5Y_MH9sJpg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/2/2016", "text": "Classic little rock favorite.

I am Brazilian and there are no Brazilian places where I am from. I jumped at the opportunity to come here while I was visiting from out of town. We started with coxinhas, which are perfect pockets of chicken and cheese that are fried (how can you go wrong?). My boyfriend and I both had \"arroz com feijao,\" his was steak and onions and mine was chicken breasts. Both were so delicious and authentic. Tastes like what my mom used to make growing up. Collard green salad, vinaigrette, ugh so good! Highly HIGHLY recommend. Prices were a little high compared to other restaurants in the area, but they give you a lot of food. We both had leftovers. Seriously, this place warmed my heart.
