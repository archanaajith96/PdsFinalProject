I generally don't take the time to have coffee at specialty coffee shops - not because I have any attitude about doing so, it's just not part of my day.Okay, now that I have likely offended everyone, let me tell you why I gave them 5 stars - Emily and the coffee beans.I read the many positive reviews on Yelp, so I went in early on Sunday to get some beans to grind and brew at home. I have gone to other local roasters to get some advice and some different kinds of beans, and have had a variety of experiences ranging from a dismissive, \"the beans are over there\" to \"what do you like, and I'll tell you what we have today\". Fuego was the latter, thank you Emily.The place is tucked away at the corner of Euclid and Atlas, and if I lived or worked downtown, it would be great to walk there. Driving there isn't too challenging, but there's not a ton of parking, so I can imagine it could be a little congested when the place was hopping.The store has not done a lot to make itself obvious on the outside - it's pretty understated, which is appealing on one hand but can cause you to drive right past them without noticing the place on the other.At 7:15am on a Sunday, it almost looked closed - the lights inside were not turned up, and the light coming in the windows was the primary illumination source. It was relaxed and inviting and not in-your-face. It was also empty, so I had Emily's undivided attention.Like I said, I am not an expert, but I really enjoy making coffee and learning about types and techniques. Emily did not try to sell me anything, she just listened to what I had to say about coffees I had enjoyed, explained the types they had, how she had experienced them, and what others had said about them. She even made several references to another local roaster to add to the information (mention a competitor in a positive way while I am in your store - that goes a LONG way with me).I ended up getting some Kenya and Colombia beans that were roasted just 4 days ago and headed home. My wife chose the Kenya, so I ground some up and made a couple of cups - it was excellent. I use an Aeropress, but am really interested in seeing what the Kenya coffee will turn out like in a moka pot. I'm enjoying a cup of the Columbia as I type this - also excellent.There are only 2 drawbacks that I will mention, but these are not enough to drop from a 5-star review: 1) The price is a little high (but I knew that going in), and 2) the bags are strange - once you tear off the little strip to open them, the opening is small - too small for the Aeropress scoop. They have a Ziploc-type seal, which is a BIG plus, but to me, the bag design makes getting the coffee out harder than it has to be. Others might like it more than I do.If you enjoy spending time with friends in coffee bars and the coffee quality and staff attitudes are important to you, I can recommend giving Fuego a try. If what you want is some good coffee advice and great beans, I can DEFINITELY recommend Fuego."}, {"review_id": "52LlUT0nfpWyu9Fc3_zV4w", "user_id": "anIkRTubm5FFCXfsCj9R_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "It's nice to know and discover all the coffee shops that Rochester has to offer.

And this is not a good thing. Thus, when it comes to crafty coffee locales, I'm probably not the bet candidate to evaluate. That being said, Fuego did not give me a hard time when I ordered my decaf iced latte. No side eye for the non-purist decaf order. Much appreciated. My latte was smooth and delicious, just as I was hoping (sans the caffeine shakes). The staff was friendly and kind and I loved the vibe inside this spot. The baked goods looked pretty choice too (bagels, donuts, vegan cookies!). Pricing seems totally fair across the board. While there are a handful of tables outside, the construction and constant cigarette smoke can really put a damper on your coffee enjoyment. I totally understand that the construction noise is just part of the ever-changing landscape in this area but the cigarette smoke is none too appealing, especially considering the proximity to the door and customers. Fuego really seems to pour some espresso dreams here, so I hope to pop back in next time I'm in Rochester."}, {"review_id": "cnItM8fiRTqZ6725pvqX8Q", "user_id": "ZQ33GXHUO25KFdBPRiuycw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Love Fuego Coffee Shop.

The Michael Jackson...The Tina Turner..The Otis Redding...The Prince...ADELE (don't judge because I did not have the patience to write \"Buy-Once\"!). Okay, Fuego is, LEGEN, wait for it, DARY! -- quota of pop culture references met.Naturally with this awesome new location on Euclid st, you can find me ordering an unsweetened Matcha Latte w/coconut milk on a daily basis during the work week. Orrr a quad Chipotle Mocha Latte with Almond milk. Orrr an Americano...Orrr in the warmer weather, amn Iced French Quarter Latte! These items are just scratching the surface on the amazingness of this establishment. TRY ALL THE ROASTS people!  And how do you top serving amazing products? Having amazing people serving them! Many familiar faces can make you an amazing cupper. Some names you may recognize are Virginia, also known as the amazing \"veebabay\" on IG whose beautiful typography has taken over local shops and inspirational posts on the gram. Chreath who you have mostly likely danced to his turn table jam sessions. And Biagio who has captured beautiful local imagery! You might also have your coffee served by owners Tony and Renee who are the most coolest ever people on this side of the Mississippi. It's always great to see them and I thank them from the bottom of my heart for bringing so much coffee goodness to our littlest City :-)"}, {"review_id": "qep5ia8MJAC0JN0l2vwXEw", "user_id": "KXBJFNBISlxwohyLNENJZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/17/2017", "text": "Fuego Coffee is a roaster I was introduced too from their pop up shop at the Brighton Summer Farmers Market.

Excellent iced coffee, although not *so* good that it didn't need anything. That's okay. My wife felt the iced tea was very good as well, which is the mark of a good coffee shop - they treat their iced tea seriously, as well. I wish I could say more, but Fuego definitely comes in as better than average, and an order of magnitude better than Starbucks."}, {"review_id": "FHaOMLv3x0fwVjV1oHkGtQ", "user_id": "vThiBE43TVjAhFHKboTFgA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I haven't drank coffee in 29 years until I tried Fuego's Chipotle Mocha -- to die for!! This is not a typical mocha latte, the touch of warm spice balances out the coffee flavor so it's not over powerful. All of their ingredients are completely fresh and natural. I really appreciate the fact that there is low carbs and sugars in Fuego's drinks, yet still amazing in taste. As a T1D for 26 years, their drinks do NOT spike my blood sugars (compared to Starbucks). I no longer support Starbucks, local supporter all the way!Lastly, the Vanilla Latte and Matcha Tea Latte are also very good. The Chipotle Mocha is still my favorite though"}, {"review_id": "fyorxZMJCobvS_-TFCss2w", "user_id": "7aQtdqg_s76c-SJDgSL_UQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/11/2017", "text": "Get an iced coconut matcha with agave!

We're visiting from Maryland and discovered this on yelp. This cute coffee shop is a great place to sit and sip coffee while chatting with friends. You can bring your laptop to study or work. The music in the background is calming making it easy to focus if you're working. The environment is so relaxing I'd be able to nap here. The tables are decorated with cute succulents and other plants. There's bar seating against the window and regular table seating. There are Christmas lights hanging from the ceiling and a few paintings on the walls. It gives an underground coffee shop kind of vibe. The barista was very helpful in helping me choose a coffee. He asked what my preferences were and made a suggestion. I don't like dark coffees and Fuegos serves a majority of light coffees. I got a mocha latte and my boyfriend got a vanilla latte (new to the menu). They were both crafted beautifully and tasted great. I'd say this is the best coffee place I've been to so far... in my life."}, {"review_id": "D1xbH6FGDy6meNPiYaNVog", "user_id": "ZxfJqk-2W05TYbRoFpXWLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/1/2017", "text": "Sometimes you just gotta go DOWNTOWN and get you some coffee!

Just why the hell did not try them sooner I'm scratching my head why. My only complaint is parking can be a hassle I'm always having to pay for it but it's a minor inconvenience but I'm a curmudgeon so it's slightly annoying. I get why others frequent the place if they work in the area they can walk to it! I've had fabulous Latte's and the Iced French Quarter (basically chicory iced coffee mixed with agave and some cream) it hits the spot.  They do have some outdoor seating and I rarely have a wait. The only reason I would give a 1/2 star is the parking situation. But all in all I give them five stars for being awesome and making some fabulous coffee. Give them a shot.

It seems like it's a lot closer to things, though realistically, the old spot wasn't THAT out of the way. The new location has considerably more seating and tons of light. Plenty of bathrooms, too (though FYI, at this early stage, there was no soap or paper towel- eek!). Their coffee is excellent quality- I've had it several times at Makers. When I go to Fuego, I like to order their iced drinks. The French Quarter is delicious, as is the Uncle Marble. They often include chicory or agave in their drinks, which add some unique flavors. My boyfriend likes to order aeropress coffee, which makes it taste even purer, stronger, and more flavorful. Love it! So glad I've learned to drink good coffee black.Fuego seems to have quite the vibrant community, so clearly I need to get down there more often! 45 Euclid has been a bar for about 5 years (open only for private events), but because that's their landlord and they're sharing a space now, they're serving alcoholic drinks there for the duration of Jazz Fest at the very least!

The interior design is quite modern and lush with subtle lighting, very cool tables and sitting furniture, and the whole place feels really relaxing and almost intimate. I took a seat by the window table, which was really cool because it allowed me to gaze out the window. I ordered a cappuccino, and while not really a cappuccino person, it was really good, and gave me a ton of energy. Let's talk about the pricing too.

Parking is a little tricky on Euclid but nothing unmanageable. I parked in the \"30 minute loading zone\" right outside the entrance and did not have a problem, but I did hear folks saying that police have been ticketing in that spot lately, so proceed with caution. Otherwise there is ample metered parking further down Euclid towards Main. I have yet to try any of the donuts but they look AMAZE and I am anxious to get there for breakfast someday soon to try one. The coffee scene in Rochester is booming in the best way and Fuego is at the heart of it. Get there now to find some peace, learn about coffee, or enjoy what is left of the Summer sunshine."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/fuego-coffee-roasters-rochester?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
