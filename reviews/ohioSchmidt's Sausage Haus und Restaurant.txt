It's a staple of German Village in Columbus, Ohio.The parking is neighborhood parking, if you get lucky enough to grab one of their on site parking spots, consider yourself lucky, go buy a lotto ticket that night.The place is always packed. We were quoted a wait of 1 hr, but the wait time actually was a bit longer. You can also use an app to see your wait time, I believe it's connected to Yelp! I got the buffet and their house golden beer.The buffet is better than I remember. I tried to eat every kind of sausage that was there. I can't say any one was my favorite, but I enjoyed it.I was too stuffed to get one of their pastries, but it was a good time to eat, talk, reminisce.

It was almost 8 pm, and we were hungry.Out of nowhere, the FIL suggests Schmidt's. Now as an avid Yelp user -- and someone who has been burned by family dining recommendations in the past -- my husband and I look it up on Yelp.And we find it has great reviews and we can get on the list for a table via the Yelp app. A little bit later, we're at Schmidt's, our stomachs rumbling over the promise of soul-filling German food.And because we put it our name on the list while still in the car, just a little bit later we had a table in this busy restaurant.I opted for the Haus Saurbraten und Gravy ($13.75), which included marinated lean beef served over German spaetzle noodles with traditional gingersnap gravy.Sauerbraten and spaetzle are my absolute favorite German delicacies. When I saw it on the menu, there was no question about what I would get. And this dish did not disappoint. The sauerbraten was tender enough to cut with a fork and full of savory flavor. The spaetzle was little puffs that soaked up the gravy.The dish comes with two sides, so I got the potato pancakes with applesauce and sweet kraut. The pancakes were smaller and thinner, like I like them. The kraut, on the other hand, was not what I was expecting. It was sweet with a bite. I liked it.Schmidt's also offers an awesome German beer list. I had to get the Weihenstephaner 1809 Berlinerweisse beer. Considering it's a sour beer, it may not have been the ideal beer to pair with such a savory meal on a cold winter night. But it's one of my faves; I had to do it.And the dessert -- oh my! My husband I shared one of their half-pound, jumbo cream puffs. We got it with vanilla cream. This was decadent and delicious.Some other reasons to love Schmidt's:* The tuba and accordion band -- Squeezing and Wheezing, I think their name was -- was hilarious and such a fun addition to the meal. How can anyone *not* like polka music?!? It's just so happy. And when the band covers non-polka songs, like \"Under The Sea\" and the Mario Bros. theme, even better.* Schmidt's also has a sausage buffet. I tried a few bites from my husband's plate -- shhhh, buffet guests aren't supposed to share -- and the sausage was great too. Buffet diners also get a discount on the large cream puffs.* Be sure to visit the bathrooms when you visit. Instead of boring elevator music, the audio included instructions on how to say popular catchphrases, like \"I'll be back\" and \"Show me the money,\" in German.Kitschy? Yeah. But Schmidt's goes back to 1886 and is a fun experience with awesome food. If I ever get to go back, I want to check out the surrounding German Village too."}, {"review_id": "t6QDzrBpPwDFD8cigvYkEw", "user_id": "Tg8ow0L16Lquwcx2nRSvuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "If you live in the Columbus area and have never visited Schmidt's, what the heck is wrong with you? It's the official food of Columbus - The Bahama Mama! I usually get the Autobahn buffet and eat sausage until it comes out of my ears. The Rueben however? Top 3 I've ever had. Perfect meat to kraut ratio, delicious marbled rye, and tasty cheese and dressing. Cream puffs are a must-try, and they have a great selection of German ales and lagers on tap. It can get busy on weekends, but they have call-ahead seating or opentable app access. While waiting on a table, take a stroll over to their gift shop down the street a bit, lots of tasty candies and gifts!"}, {"review_id": "3ARLtH5B2mVUBQSBVkLeIg", "user_id": "AKmV-EpzorGFKEGE4qUwtQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Once again a situation where I was so excited for my food that I forgot to take a picture...Arrived at 5 pm, and there was already a 1 hour wait time for 2 people. They took our name and phone number down, which was nice because we could explore the area while we waited for our table to be ready. This was pretty much perfect timing, because a lot of the local shops close at 6. We were seated after exactly an hour. Our server (Candace?) was very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. The service was awesome considering how packed the place was. Our food came out within 15 minutes of ordering, which we did not expect to happen. I ordered the bratwurst sandwich, which came with potato pancakes, apple sauce, and a pickle spear. The plate looked underwhelming when it came out, but I was very impressed with the food and it was just the perfect amount, leaving room for dessert. It's not like average restaurants where you're served a ton of mediocre food. This food was quality and very delicious. For dessert I got a vanilla cream puff. They're as big as your fist, so definitely enough to split, or to take some home. These are a must-try. By the time we were leaving, the wait was up to 2 hours, so I would definitely plan ahead if you're visiting Schmidt's. But honestly, it's absolutely worth it."}, {"review_id": "4ZALdrGkc2awSHckzJfn7g", "user_id": "-kik8rcF-1nkSpAzuf6VrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Excellent lunch buffet and the service and food was first class authentic....skip the chain and come here!"}, {"review_id": "g2ManwI5a9bQw9bpi3FjQw", "user_id": "WjzId1p8cyZGIcjVNlKivg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Just get on the autobahn, you will need be disappointed.   This place is an institution & is as good as any in Columbus.  Just get there early on the weekend."}, {"review_id": "RT4lzww9PREcD0fhgtHUdg", "user_id": "0PCM8QMFWatpzBMRUVOVbQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/11/2017", "text": "Wow! I didn't know that German food had influenced so much of the American staples that we place on the dinner table.I came here with two other friends on a Wednesday around 3, and it wasn't busy at all. Sooo many tables open. There were a few folks here and there, mostly grandparents. This is probably the best time to come since it can get really packed on weekends and evenings.We decided to share an appetizer, so we got Schmidt's pretzel nuggets. So yum! They were warm and fresh and absolutely delightful! I'd come here again and again only to eat those! They came with honey mustard and then we added beer cheese. Oh, man! That beer cheese was the best decision ever! Boy, it was so good. Even better than the honey mustard.They do buffet here, but eh! We weren't gonna do that. I ordered the German meatloaf, which was under the dinner section, I believe. It comes with sides, so I had applesauce, potato cakes (?), peas, and of course, they give you a roll. The meatloaf was so easy to eat and moist. The mushroom sauce on top gave it such a nice flavor too. My only complaint is the roll. Do people in Germany care for it? Cuz I don't. It was the most useless afterthought. I took one bite and that was the end of my meal. It's nothing special and didn't need to be there. Schmidt's could save a little more money and not serve any more rolls.My friends got schnitzel and the sausage sampler. The schnitzel also had the mushroom sauce and was the star of my friend's plate! Oh, so good! She also had that obnoxious roll (which she also didn't finish, a clear reason why Schmidt's should stop serving them), green beans with spaetzle, and mashed potatoes. My friend's sausage sampler came with 4 halves of sausage, a different kind of bread which was buttered and looked much more appetizing, potato salad (she didn't care for), apple sauce, and sauerkraut. The apple sauce blew me away. They make it themselves! It was chunky and really, really enjoyable. As for the sauerkraut? My friend thought it was too much. Someone I met in the bathroom from London told me it was too vinegary LOL. I think people come visit from all over just to try this place out. It's cool! The workers all dress up, making for as German of an experience as you can get in Columbus.I also tried the vanilla cream puff, something that they are also well-known for. It was absolutely amazing! So good and easy to eat in one sitting with another friend. Parking isn't that bad either. Again, we came at a good time so it wasn't busy. There's parking all around the side and back of the building."}, {"review_id": "W4z-BQBzTxsQ7ym9IIEeNg", "user_id": "JeLFo3hJS21bgb2ow9GEgQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Delicious food.  I wish schnitzel was on the buffet.  Other than that not a single complaint.  It was crowded but the flow was nice and food was quick.  Our server Dave was upbeat and incredibly helpful with clearing plates.  I look forward to returning."}, {"review_id": "O1uglqggsavACdA98jmrZQ", "user_id": "ev_CLyUAl8P1qbodtzlxEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "The Autobahn, what could be said that wasn't already.

I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here and it was spectacular for that. I still hoard bahama mamas (their spicy sausages) whenever I visit Columbus so that I have a supply to grill when I leave. That all being said, the actual dining experience has recently been less amazing.First, the setup. This is the oldest restaurant in Columbus and is famous for their german sausages. Typically when you come, you get the all-you can eat buffet which includes few sides (and good ones) along with access to all the different kinds of sausage. They also have cream puffs bigger than your fist that are to die for. My wife is from Columbus and this was one of the places we *always* went whenever we visited.We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and found out they have an amazing private event space upstairs with two room set up off a hallway made to look like a cobblestone street complete with street lamps. The set up the buffet in \"street\" and your guests can go help themselves as they see fit. It was amazing.That all being said, the last few times we've been I've felt like the sausages in the buffet, while good, aren't as good as they are when I grill them at home. I don't know if they're boiling them instead of grilling them, or grilling on a metal hot plate instead of over fire, but it's just disappointing. Not that they aren't good--they still are--but they are not as good as they could and should be.Still, the ambiance is great, the sausages are good, the sides are great, there's even some local craft beer on tap now. So, you won't be disappointed, but it's no longer the shining star in our food out in Columbus that it once was."}, {"review_id": "Z0SirI44GMpvgEfJh-2vKw", "user_id": "l-3-ieqVXSUzlKBzYYfPdA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "Love this place.

One of my favorite items is the Bavarian Ham & Cheese Sandwich, which comes served on a soft pretzel bun. I always slather the bun with their Spicy Mustard (this is fantastic and I recommend putting this on almost every dish they serve). I like to get an order of their mashed potatoes as my side because they're buttery and garlicky, which is what makes this pair so well with the sandwich.My other go-to is the original Bahama Mama. It has some great spice and bold flavors that you taste with every bite. This is one of the best sausage platters I've had from any restaurant and it has such a truly authentic German taste.The only downside to dining here is during the weekends. You need to be prepared to wait for a very long time. It's a popular place and they do their best to turn around the tables as quickly as possible. So just be patient with them and stroll the surrounding German Village neighborhood, because the food is definitely worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "FrCV7I_Z-7y9QD3c9VHBwA", "user_id": "REaO8odqCNjbwznsfjDHJg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "German comfort food at its best.

The meatloaf pairs really well with the tangy red cabbage and the potato salad.The claim to fame, however, is the massive cream puff.  The classic vanilla cream is very rich filling up a soft pastry shell.

They make amazing sausages and the quality of all of their dishes is always spot on. Our go-to here is their autobahn buffet because you can grab a little bit of everything, but we had them cater our wedding and that had to have been the most amazing version of their food that we've had (at least the bites we had between pictures). The mac and cheese is awesome fresh and the spicy Bahama Mamas pack a lot of flavor, no sauce needed. You will be full after a meal here but you would be doing yourself a disservice by not getting a cream puff. If you have to grab one to take home with you. Whether you're in town visiting for the day or you've lived in the area forever Schmidt's is a fantastic choice when you're craving German food or any food.
