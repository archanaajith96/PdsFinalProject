After being told multiple times the kind of tamales we wanted. Then she asked if we wanted a combination and we stated no just rice and beans separate from the tamales.She still could not get the order right , we had to pull to the side  and we had to wait 30 minutes for our order. To on top it off the order was incorrect.We asked the lady who brought the order  to speak to the manager. Told us to wait she would notify the manager however we waited some more. Finally I called the restaurant , while waiting outside.  A lady on the phone stated the manager was not in. I doubt I will be coming again. Poor customer service.Very disappointed."}, {"review_id": "eUvtB3bs6nzz7BK-fIHkWw", "user_id": "ibUb5SrTQA-taVJNXx2bCA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "We selected Taquitos Jaliscos from other YELP ratings, looking for some good Mexican food.  This is a \"take out\" spot.  We are here for SPRING TRAINING.  Hello baseball fans, this is a safe bet for good Mexican and late night cravings.  I can cook, and I know good Mexican food,,  this place is better than AVERAGE.   Hospitality was friendly, and welcoming.  We arrived at 9pm..  the place was fairly busy, I ordered my usual,,  3 Carnitas Street tacos,,  we also ordered the Taco salad, Chicken taquitos, a Chile verde dinner, and a quesadilla.    My tacos came with roasted onions - added a nice flavor,,   all the food was hot, and served to us within 5 minutes of us sitting down.   I can tell a good restaurant by the taste of their fried beans,,   Excellent.    By the time we were done, the restaurant was packed,, not an OPEN seat in sight.   a DARK part of town (4 stars) ,, but busy...  If I am in the area,,  I will RETURN.  15min drive from our hotel in Scottsdale."}, {"review_id": "pRZreN2Wdnki32zfV-AYUA", "user_id": "YKPM9UDqKzPpgekWTFezsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Ate lunch here. Small quaint a place. Staff was friendly. Food was pretty good. Very close to the flavors in Mexico. Torta with carne asada was great. Horchata was good. Some places are grainy but this one was smooth as it should be. Salsa bar was small but what they had was very good.

It's a small building but the atmosphere was very inviting. The staff there is great and friendly. They've got a salsa bar with a variety of salsa that is well kept and up to temperature. The food was really good. We got the macho nachos and the Taquitos and guess what? It was served with rice and beans...haha. (You'd have to read my Manuel's review to get that). The prices are reasonable and the food filling. This place well kept and maintained. This will definitely be a spot I'll come back too! They've got a huge menu as well. If you're in the mood for some good Mexican food you should give this place a try."}, {"review_id": "yJDqN3TwoMQgmRH4sjCpeQ", "user_id": "mE1s4m1_vaVPY-pMu7gHvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/5/2017", "text": "I drive by every week and it only took me a recommendation and years to finally get around to visiting enjoying it.A friend showed up as I was shooting a Disc Golf Tournament in Scottsdale and tortured me with the wonderful smell of Green Chili Beef. My mouth was watering and I started to fantasize about it. He was nice enough to let me have a taste.It can be hard to find good Green Chili Beef or Pork. Lots of places make it but so few do it right.I've eaten here 3 times. Always Green Chili for me, but others loved the hard tacos and Enchiladas. Only the dark green salsa is good. The others tasted chemically wrong. But the green is spicy and rich in flavor."}, {"review_id": "dibdkderfZZ5-5Tq3zP9Dw", "user_id": "hazFjLv3rVO_9V9wSQ55Gw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "Made the drive from Fountain Hills because we are still desperate to find a to go to Mexican place. Came here on a Sunday afternoon last week after 3PM and it was crowded. It's a small location and every table was taken and there was a line of about 4-5 people crowding the front of the restaurant at any given time.When it was our turn to order, we had a girl cashier take our order. We had a couple questions about the menu and she answered them curtly with no enthusiasm or sign of friendliness. We were going to order 2 orders of the #31 the shredded beef and taco rice and beans plate but at the last minute I saw the $7.99 daily special was of better value and decided to change my mind. This way I would be able to taste a little bit of everything, an enchilada, Chile relleno and the shredded beef taco.I noticed that there was going to be price difference and asked her to change what she was about to charge me. The cashier punched some numbers in a calculator and then pretended to make changes in what she was ringing up. Thinking she made the adjustment I didn't look at my receipt. The cashier handed me my card and receipt and we sat down waiting for our food to be delivered.A couple things then happened:1) My changed order didn't reflect a price difference on my receipt. Not only did she charge me the original full price for the first order she rung up but she gave me the wrong size drink. The smaller size drink. Btw, there are no refills included at this place.2) When our food was delivered, my husband's taco plate was warm but the 2/3 tacos were cold.3) All the food on my 3 item plate was lukewarm and drenched in oil.4) The Chile relleno had the thickest batter on it and when I forked it, it was cold in the middle. I took apart the batter from the Chile and just ate the Chile. 5) The enchilada was lukewarm and was way too salty.6) As far as the shredded beef taco, the meat was nicely seasoned and was decent tasting.7) At the end of the meal, I went to the only bathroom in the restaurant and found it to be a unisex bathroom. The bathroom did not meet my cleanliness meter as it had a damp unknown smell and toilet paper strewn on the floor. I walked in and walked right out.Not sure if we came on an off day but thus so far was our experience and we will not be returning."}, {"review_id": "ao-SzbgG9w3sIn4zjX26Dw", "user_id": "0fTwR6cAPJqnHcJf6ZOdsA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "The place is a dump and in a dumpy area, but the food is amazing!

You won't be disappointed at all. The guacamole was probably my favorite, it has an incredible taste and texture. I ordered the #8 daily special and each and every bite hit the spot.

Food is good and the service is pretty quick. Food arrives hot. Love the salsa bar and choices. They keep it clean and filled. The avocado/ cucumber salsa is so good! Refills on drinks are 50cents. The taquitos are so good. It comes topped with a spicy guacamole. The menudo is very tasty with honeycomb tripe. Kids meal Cheese Enchiladas is a very big portion.
