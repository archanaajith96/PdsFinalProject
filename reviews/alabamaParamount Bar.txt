Wings made at Paramount are prepared by angels sent to earth to satisfy taste buds. Only in BirminghamI ordered barbecue wings covered in scallions, served with a hefty side of celery and carrots. Who covers falloff-the-bone amazing drum-met flats in Chinese onions? PARAMOUNT! And it's heavenly. Trying to watch my figure so I left the fries in the kitchen but they are wonderful as well. The sauce is super smokey with subtle hints of sweet. Friday nights are really amazing at Paramount because their delicious Moscow Mules are only 7 bucks!"}, {"review_id": "ekR7OMoCj_I9V0w4rJgsfQ", "user_id": "hgY-mvy9RkGijCIYLk0k0Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Paramount is a great Birmingham experience.  It's where I found out I'm great at Skee-Ball, and that I love dirty martinis with extra olives (the olives are massive here) - memories made!  Paramount is great for small groups, but it is ALWAYS crowded, so I think more than three or four people would struggle to find seating here unless you came way early.  There is a sizeable arcade in the back, so bring your change!  There is a bar in the front and one in the back and several tables for seating I usually end up stalking back and forth waiting for someone to leave so I can take their seat.Paramount has a menu full of great drinks and appetizers.  My favorites include a cocktail (the Ginger Avenger) that tastes like an upgraded Moscow Mule and the Great Balls of Fire - fried risotto, bacon, scallion, and cheese balls studded with jalapenos, and ranch on the side for dipping.I feel this review would be remiss if I did not address the famous Paramount Grilled Cheese (reputed to be the best in Alabama).  I don't doubt it was because the night was so busy, but for a sandwich billed to contain \"savory-tomato jam,\" my sandwich barely had any.  It was also extremely burned on the side facing down, so I didn't notice it at first.  Don't get me wrong - I ate the whole thing, and it was still really good.  I will try it again, and if these wrongs are corrected, I will bump up my above rating."}, {"review_id": "ubu_EIgeWlehSL-1u71QpQ", "user_id": "IvwbNOJrIQRSGJvUfjcbpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "OH MY WOWZER!!!!This place exceeded more expectations than I could have imagined!!! Went this past Saturday at lunch. Place was packed out. Server said about 20 mins before we could get a table. In the meantime we sat at the bar and ordered some beers. I went ahead and tried the Ghost Train Blueberry Smoothie beer, which I might say was phenomenal. Withing 10 mins we were seated at a table and our server, Emily, was fast, friendly and very helpful!! I went with the Southern Hotdog with fries. This massive dog consisted of fried pickles, ranch, pimento cheese, chow chow and packed with flavor. Fries were hot and fresh and mote than a plentiful portion. Good came out fast even though the place waa crowded. We didn't get to play any games being we were rushed on our timeframe. I defiently can not wait to come back and sit in the back to do the games and arcades. This place is rocking and had tip top service and staff. Highly recommend if you are looking for somewhere fun, different but with kickbutt food and service."}, {"review_id": "mmix6s6cyaTyMCNg0Bdiew", "user_id": "blqCOWpDFRVdKeja4qF0nw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "I've now been here twice. Both times were good experiences with the food as well and service. The atmosphere doesn't disappoint either. What couldn't be better than combining extremely good bar food like burgers, wings, etc AND a side area of arcade games? Look no further than Paramount! The drink selection is pretty extensive and has excellent local choices; and while smaller, the food menu doesn't disappoint and is perfect for options-not too big but not limited either. I have had the Great Balls of Fire appetizer (fried cheese) and the hummus and both were super tasty and rich. The burgers are competitive with the best in Birmingham. All are cooked to your liking, yet juicy and full of flavor and served quickly as well. Parking can be a big issue if you come here during busy hours, so be prepared to walk a little ways if during peak times. I know there is a pay lot about a block away, so that is always an option if you can't find street parking. Oh yeah-The arcade area is great! Lots of options from skeeball to pinball machines to classic arcades like Galaga and Pac Man. they also have a machine for bills that will convert to quarters. Warning-the pricing is usually .50 to $1 per game, so make sure you bring a good bit of quarters or cash to budget for that if you want to play a while. I will definitely return."}, {"review_id": "xIGAb008P4ut2P_IdYBTrw", "user_id": "fwkwT4NSW4proYOZugUYnQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "Had a lil meet up here on a slow Sunday night. Service was forgettable, and I don't mean, it was average so I didn't remember it. I mean, it felt like they forgot everything and even our table as a whole. Water was not even brought out to us until after all of the food had arrived. I had an order of their wings, the lemon rosemary wings is seriously delicious here. Personally I'm not a big fan of these type of bars. Service was friendly, but just kind of lacking and disappointing. If you're into watching sports or playing some arcade, it's a neat spot. I just wish service was better."}, {"review_id": "h2gwd05i7TcDtkxLrp2m5Q", "user_id": "7k2eMBDkhUHS6kk7k0K0rQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "We enjoyed a Sunday afternoon here. We enjoyed the burger with blue she's- delicious!

Came here on a rainy Sunday night, the 80's music playing was entertaining we completely forgot about the weather outside. The atmosphere, decor and vibe is full of cheerfulness. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, asked all the right questions to give food suggestions. There were 5 of us we tried all the different type of wings to share, the Jamaican jerk and lemon rosemary were the favorites of the table. The hamburgers were cook to perfection, delicious. The chicken salad made to perfection, light on the mayonnaise, all the ingredients were fresh and tasted oh so good. The chili hit the spot on a rainy cold night. The high energy in the video room was contagious, the whole room was full of smiles and laughter. Definitely a great place to have fun and eat delicious pub style food."}, {"review_id": "fMGzyKhFQshJT227qNMZaw", "user_id": "jZTR-5gwO8Y_kbAwv99sqQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/21/2017", "text": "Paramount is a great place to get food/drinks and hangout! We came here on a Thursday night and waited about 30 minutes to be seated, which wasn't too bad. We just went to the back and played games till we were called. I loved the classic arcade games in the back, especially skee ball, pac man and pinball. There's a change machine and an ATM if you don't have coins. The games are pretty cheap, average or 50 cents to $1.I ordered the Ed, Edd and Eddy, which is one of their signature cocktails. I got it with cranberry vodka and it was tasty. I loved the tin can they served it in, very cute. My boyfriend was in town visiting, so he tried a local Birmingham beer (Yellowhammer Cheatin' Heart). I'm not a beer person but they've got a good selection of beers here.The food was pretty decent too. We got the Sawmill fries and Jamaican jerk wings. The fries were good, I liked the pickled peppers but was ambivalent about the sausage. I wish they were hotter/crispier when we got them. The wings were okay. I prefer saucier wings and these were a dry rub. The mango habanero was also way too sweet. But the garlic aioli sauce was good!My boyfriend got the Forester burger, which he enjoyed. The mushrooms were yummy! Overall, we had a great time at Paramount and I'd definitely come back again!"}, {"review_id": "DI-P2V1Dt_m8ERrzV2ZTZw", "user_id": "efxC9skj5aGLRM5TTf0gmw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So I finally tried the food here, and how have I not tried their food?!?! It was amazing!! I started off with an appetizer. The Great Balls of Fire was fried risotto balls with meat and jalapeño with ranch dressing for dipping. It was amazing and a great way to start off the meal. All the appetizers looked pretty yummy. I knew I needed something healthy now, so there I was straight for the salad. I got the So Simple. Oh my god!!! Best salad ever possibly?!?! I needed to learn how to make it yesterday!! It was that good. The base was mixed greens, with just hints of chicken that I probably wouldn't have even missed if it weren't there since the cheese, nuts, and vinaigrette were so so yummy. And I've always been a pro meat on salad eater. They have a game area in the back. Basketball, skee ball, arcade games, and my favorite...pinball! To drink I had the Not a Margarita. It was not a margarita, it was so much better! Something about it was fruity. I had to take off one star cause I ordered it without salt on the rim and it came on the rim. Easy fix cause all you have to do is not lick it."}, {"review_id": "uibLz16xDLt2ORsOfRj50Q", "user_id": "2DCKZKJhVuHPaT7_tf0Khw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2017", "text": "I love the concept of this place.  Full restaurant with a good selection of food.  Indoor and outdoor seating is available (really limited outdoor seating).  Walk through the bar to the back room and you can turn back the clock to a classic arcade and game room.  Pinball machines, video games (pretty good selection) as well as basketball shooting game.  Prices are really reasonable for the arcade games.I had the Ed & Eddie Peach flavor....these are seriously one of the best drinks in town.  Also, for you cider fans they carry Angry Orchard (somebody in our group was very happy).  We also gave an app a try, The Great Balls of Fire: crispy-fried risotto, bacon, jalapenos, cheddar, scallions, and homemade ranchSo good!  Anxious for a return visit to try dinner.  Have heard great things about the wings and burgers.  Great fun time here and need to add to the regular rotation."}, {"review_id": "HXwxq1JbCpsb4Vo8jO2usg", "user_id": "z2uWAtfmNmajln8jSQkDxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "I brought my little brother for lunch today, we came in and were immediately greeted and sat by a friendly hostess.

We waited about 15 minutes for a table at 6:30 on a Saturday--not bad at all.Husband had a couple draft beers and a corned beef sandwich, and I had a Moscow Mule and chili and grilled cheese. The food was all really outstanding. Husband's onion rings in particular were out of this world good. First of all, they're not rings--more like straight pieces 2-3\" long. Easier to eat. Secondly, I believe they're both battered and breaded, so the crunch is ridiculous.We ended up here because we wanted a place within walking distance of our concert venue, and Birmingham is seriously lacking in downtown options! It's a full service restaurant, but definitely a bar atmosphere--loud, several TVs, lots of people standing around--but we lucked into an uncrowded spot behind the host stand which was perfect for me as I'm a bit claustrophobic and I typically stay away from crowded bars.Las thing I'll say is that the service was outstanding. From hostesses to the bartender to our server to a manager who swung by our table to check in, everybody was very friendly and helpful.

My friend and I started our night here instead of ending up here. It was Sunday and 6 ish so there weren't too many people. I had discussed this magnificent grilled cheese with him for a while so we both ordered the grilled cheese. We even had water so it wouldn't mess with the flavor. It took around 10 min to get our cheeses. They really were hot and super cheesy. There was no grease! The bread was a little more cooked than I like it, but it didn't take anything away from the sandwich as a whole. Every bite left a string of cheese! Once again, this sandwich was superb. We ended up talking and I took half my sandwich home (I just reheated it and it tasted just as good). The waiters were nice asking us if we needed help and we didn't feel rushed.My friend really loved the grilled cheese and so do I. I will definitely be back again for this amazing grilled cheese!"}, {"review_id": "OBvblgackw6PM4yd1Fcmxw", "user_id": "NPxx0-2scdEpEB-GRSj17w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Very cool place.

Because a bar with arcade games is virtually an automatic 5 stars.   ---   ---   ---On a work trip to visit colleagues in Atlanta and Birmingham, there was one common thread: I was going to viciously defeat anyone who stood in my way in the game of Pop-a-Shot. Jonathan T in Atlanta felt the wrath, and now it was time for Will B to go down, in an equally unmercifully fashion.Will B would later repay the favor in several games of bumper pool, but this was the time of night that I was able to shine. After Will was blown out of the arena a few times, I garnered some other challengers in the form of random Paramount Patrons. They too, fell to the same fate.But none of this victoriousness would have been possible if it weren't for Paramount. I admit, we didn't do much else here, besides grab a tasty beverage, get our money's worth on Pop-a-Shot, and head for the exits - one of us a champion, and the other plotting his revenge.Paramount is most certainly a dive bar, which adds to its charm. Think Dave & Busters, if D&B didn't update their look since the 70's. And I mean that in the most fond way possible.
