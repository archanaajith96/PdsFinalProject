I don't live in Missoula but my daughter and her hubby do, and I have eaten here about 4 or 5 times on visits to see my daughter.On each occasion the wait staff has been very friendly, efficient and knowledgeable...they know the menu and they know their beer! Food is hot, fries are crisp, salads are fresh and tasty! Even burgers are cooked to order so that you can actually get one rare if that is the way you want it!  And...extensive, excellent beer list to choose from!Around happy hour it can get pretty crowded and loud but I like that. In the spring and summer there is outside seating if you prefer."}, {"review_id": "g4Y7oJ0qmp_oOMRwD7WfFQ", "user_id": "d29iStkRdA07teOZn9fWhQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/10/2018", "text": "Stopped by this place for lunch while we were in Missoula because I had seen another Yelpers pictures of the nachos there and was wondering if they were really that big. Let me tell you..YES! They are!! We ordered the half nachos with pulled pork and added chicken for $4 more. I would have liked to have gotten guacamole, another $4 charge, but passed this time around. It took awhile for the food to come out but it was definitely worth it!! The portions were amazing and the price was very decent for what we got. I love that there was plenty of meat and cheese on the nachos but would have liked it to have come with guacamole not just the salsa and sour cream. Another friend that was with us ordered a wrap off the gluten free menu and she said she really liked the flavor and the fillings that were in her sandwich. They also have several different kinds of beers on tap. We passed on that this time but would like to look into getting the beer flight the next time we're there. I would definitely come here again if I was in town to try some of the other items on the menu and would recommend this place to anyone coming to Missoula. This establishment is larger then it seems. When you first come in there are stairs to your left that lead to a large bar area with TVs and tables downstairs in the basement. Upstairs when you come in there is a small bar and a few tables and a few tables toward the back of the room which is misleading because if you continue to walk toward the back it opens up into another huge room where there is a lot more seating and some bathrooms."}, {"review_id": "fsIm1ylxw7udDzOVKuvQ6w", "user_id": "UAbCj6xOjUmq0ZHTLpbexA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "There are so many things to love about Tamarack, the brewery food, the local beer, the bloody mary bar. Unfortunately they forget that they are in Montana, not Seattle or NYC and charge as if they have an ocean view. The double gin and tonic here with the same local gin is $10.50?!  I pay $6 dollars for that drink at the Depot regular price, or $4 on happy hour, $7 at the Iron Horse, and $6.50 at the distillery that makes the gin (right down the block).There are so many excellent places in Missoula that serve similar (or the same food and drinks) why pay double?"}, {"review_id": "Y3xv3ZSO7ltPA1-ChntA7Q", "user_id": "0jnWqEkN6b65Xl-SAu9zNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Sunday Brunch!! Must go! The upstairs of the brewery looks and feels very much like you're typical brewery. The downstairs is more of a sports bar sort of atmosphere. I went with some co-workers for their Sunday Brunch. And I have to say I was very very impressed. The food was terrific (just as good as any high end brunch place you spend way more $$) They had much more food than I expected. Reasonably priced too. They had a lot of great options. I decided to go with just the traditional breakfast with eggs and breakfast potatoes and added a side waffle. It was so much food. I had a beermosa to start... The other girls had done the \"make your own mimosas\" (there was also a Bloody Mary bar) and I was very impressed/ jealous with how fun it was to choose from several types of juices and add frozen berries. So I switched to the mimosas. I was not disappointed! I will have to go back and check out the actual beer/brewery part of it, but the food and drinks were great!"}, {"review_id": "EiwD1y5eytNfsQQ-QH0Njw", "user_id": "XJGShcyB0m1FKywHDBeyRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "My very favorite local brewery, great beer and food, and the service is amazing which is rare never have had a bad experience at this place"}, {"review_id": "aL-yKooe7iLMAPtXNWkurA", "user_id": "5roCqYi5HaB8vufBSUUpoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/10/2017", "text": "First time in Missoula. We selected Tamarack based on reviews and they offered more than just pizza. We ordered beers (very good) and sandwiches.  Both sandwiches were huge. The portion of coated French fries were also huge. Both sandwiches and fries were excellent. We ordered a French Dip and a Pastrami sandwich. Can't go wrong with either.

Their portions are generous and they do many genres well from massive Belgian style waffles to heuvos rancheros. The smoked salmon hash with a croissant was a perfect start to the day without being too heavy. It's ridiculous to add butter to a croissant but their butter is so good that you'll find yourself dipping back in to the little container time and time again. I didn't sample their beers or dessert but that pizza cookie is on the list for the next visit."}, {"review_id": "fUv2YMFFH56uVusE2u81TA", "user_id": "P4CEb2L_O1V0zS3mbjyOKQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "It pretty typical brewery food. I don't drink so I haven't tried the beer but the root beer is delicious. The fish and chips are pretty impressive. Massive pieces of hand battered high quality fish and they have really good battered fries. Their apps are hit or miss, burgers are huge and really good as was the French dip. Didn't love the chicken Brie sandwich. Service is ok, tons of families with kids so I usually sit in the bar area. It's a great place if you don't quite know what you want to eat, they have a little bit of everything and lots of free parking on the weekends."}, {"review_id": "Lu3TgYxj9tVNYlR-arm07g", "user_id": "iGgfRZERC8qioUwIAidvZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Very good!  Price is right.

Get them here!Don't get the full order unless you have 20 people sharing them! ORDER JYST THE HALF ORDER WITH MEAT... at $17 it was enough for 3 of us to have as our main meal and 2 more to enjoy some as appetizers...The bison burger is HUGE too and looked good but I didn't try it. Good reviews from those that did.  Fries aren't quite streak fries but almost. The fish tacos are outstanding...i got to try my neighbors lolThe salads are a good portion... and look fresh.  Quesadilla looked average but was a good size as well. The pork Verde burrito is gigantic and looks like it had about 1.5 lbs of pork in it.  I was disappointed in the pizza bites appetizer I ordered on my first visit.  Thankfully I shared others meals Ann's so I still left full. You won't be disappointed here wth the quantity for sure. From what I could tell during our two visits, you won't be disappointed in the flavors either. Drinks.... in not a beer drinker... most of our party liked the top hat and the amber.  I tried the Lakeside and wouldn't get it ever but again I don't like beer lolWhat I did like and drank way too much of was orphan girl bourbon.... creamy like Bailey's. Think tequila rose in bourbon... yum...Get the Montana Bulldog... tastes like an adult root beer float made with their fresh Training Wheels root beer... goes down wayy too easy!!!! Definitely the restaurant I will return to if I come back to Missoula!"}, {"review_id": "jQRnt20aXksdFqghhk5e4w", "user_id": "g_qAr7DpWL6Hj8XdL0rIww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/18/2017", "text": "Food is very good.  The steak sandwich was generous in portion and cooked to perfection.  The side salad was fresh and varied.  The beers!So many good brews.

I ordered the Baja chicken sandwich and instead received this grilled chicken with caramelized onions and Brie cheese. Though it wasn't what I ordered it was very tasty. The only complaint I would have is I wish I would have received what I ordered but based on what I received, I wish the chicken breast was larger because it only covered about half of the bun. The french fries that came along with it were battered and very tasty. You get a hefty quantity of them and the ranch sauce on the side is delicious for dipping. I especially loved the crunchy dill pickle it added the perfect accompaniment to the meal. Overall I would absolutely go back."}, {"review_id": "O88oUkhwlkDAUz5SDGvQ9g", "user_id": "JzMzoYFcxYtfgKPX1c3WTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2017", "text": "My daughter and bestie stopped in here for lunch while exploring Missoula.Free street parking can be found. Discover is an accepted form of payment.Upstairs and downstairs seating is available. We chose to sit downstairs since we all prefer a bar setting.During our visit, a build your own Bloody Mary and Mimosa bar was offered. We all chose to build our own Bloody Mary for $6 each. We were able to choose either Clamato or V8 juice as our Mary base. From there, garnishments were extensive: horseradish, celery salt, black pepper, garlic salt, Worcestershire, pepper sauces, cucumber, celery, pickle spears, green onions, cherry tomatoes, pepperocinis, artichokes and BACON. My daughter was in absolute heaven.We shared the Buffalo Chicken Strips (qyt 3) for $9.95 and the Étouffée for $15.95. Both meals were flavorful and plentiful for the three of us.The Keg Power Tower is a value added touch for patrons that need to charge their cell phones.The bathrooms were furbished out of cool rusted corrugated metal. The bathroom sink was in the shape of a beer bottle.Our server Mykala was friendly and personable."}, {"review_id": "yjme8EL4bKciSHc2cBr1LA", "user_id": "2H5hiZ0pgCeO8y2UlVzCXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Good selection of beer.
