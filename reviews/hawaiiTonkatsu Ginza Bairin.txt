We got there around 2pm and there was no wait, hooray! I got the \"A\" mixed katsu set with pork tenderloin, pork loin, minced pork, and a croquette. He got the \"C\" with pork loin katsu and 4 appetizers. Both portion came with endless cabbage salad, miso soup, and rice. It was a feast for us.The \"A\" had more fried meat than even I wanted to eat but I made him trade some of his appetizers and it worked out perfectly. The tonkatsu was very tasty, with a nice crunch on the outside and moist meat within. The salad and soup were necessary to balance the heaviness from the meat. We walked out feeling full and satisfied."}, {"review_id": "DGV9PFqd3hUdMDAVZovgGw", "user_id": "oz3Yt1fy0j02Ymiaf0Fypw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Great service n foods!This was highly recommended by a friend.

We came around 6/7pm on a Friday and there was actually no wait like I thought there would be. You can park at the bank and they validate your parking!! Parking otherwise is really difficult and the street is confusing (but isn't all of Hawaii).We were seated at the bar thing and immediately looked at the menu to be greeted with preeeetty pricey stuff (around $30 for the pork katsu meals). I went with the thick loin cut since our server said it was his favorite. It came pretty quickly, with the rice coming out first with a little side dish with pickled vegetables. Soon, we were given our meals which included salad and miso soup! Be warned, everything is UNLIMITED and you can refill everything (it's a huge trap!!)The salad is sooo good and I loved both sauces. I think one is like a sesame sauce and the other is some kind of ponzu tasting sauce? I don't know but it was delicious and I drowned my salad in both. We loved the sauce so much our server gave us the huge bottle to refill it on our own. The miso soup is also really good, tastes pretty authentic. Of course, my favorite part was the pork which was soo tender and juicy and also delicious!! I could not get enough of everything about the meal here and left extremely happy with my tummy.Service was also really good and he was fast and helpful!Tip is included with the bill. The only reason I give 4 stars is because of the prices but it was worth it for the one time I tried it!"}, {"review_id": "FcWqAh3V1JuJ7P3V3zi9Ag", "user_id": "cLwTiKPZJK-a_hV6rYQuaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "I used to think tonkatsu could get so good. This restaurant proves that it can be taken to another level. To start, you can park in the Hawaiian bank underground parking garage for up to 1.5 hours free with validation. This is some of the best tonkatsu I've ever had. We got the mixed katsu set which comes with tenderloin, loin, and minced kurobuta pork. The breading was very crispy and flaky. The minced may have been my favorite because it was the juiciest. The tonkatsu sauce was also really good since you can add some spicy sauce to it. The chopped cabbage is sliced thinly and comes with a sesame sauce and a soy ginger sauce that made the cabbage taste great. The miso soup has lots of toppings inside and gives it a bit more of a complex flavor. We also had shrimp katsudon which is not my favorite since the breading gets soggy, but it was cooked well and the shrimps were huge. Overall an amazing foodie experience. I wish they would open one of these in LA."}, {"review_id": "kRp56-G3WAFyhQa4cl9Ljg", "user_id": "sbg0TN4NBxZCzhSquZlDEQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Totally didn't see this place when we were walking by. Based on the reviews, it looked like the chicken katsu would be delicious. The inside is small but it wasn't crowded when we went.We ordered: Special Kurobuta Pork Lion Katsu-Don and the Special Pork Tenderloin Katsu-Don + a side of cabbage. The special came w/ rice, miso soup, cabbage salad, and an egg. They both tasted pretty similar, but the pork was softer and had more fat. So if you're a little health cautious / don't like eating fat, I'd go for the first one. Both specials weren't bad but they weren't amazing either. It was a little too saucy for my taste. Perhaps I would've liked it better if I got a regular chicken katsu curry? However, the sauce they had for the cabbage was good.Overall, this place is pricey - I'm not too sure if we'll be coming back since I wasn't too amazed. Also FYI, they already include a 15% tip so be careful!!"}, {"review_id": "1KAL-VncOHaWQsvqilxqbQ", "user_id": "eMHz7HROyP-l-6EsW_NZew", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Came here around 2:00 pm for lunch and was seated immediately at a table by the door. My boyfriend and I got really lucky as we took the last open table and everyone after us had to wait. We were helped quickly after being seated and our food came in less than 10 minutes. I ordered the Katsu don and my boyfriend ordered the mix katsu set. Both orders came with cabbage salad, pickled vegetables, and miso soup. For the salad you're given the option of shoyu or sesame dressing. My Katsu don was very tender, juicy, and flavorful. I thought it came pretty close to the ones served in Japan.Because we sat by the door we were able to observe the floor staff a little more closely. The man at the podium was nice to us but when it came to other customers he seemed to come off slightly rude.

I mean, it's breaded and fried pork; is there anything else to say about it?Sis got the katsu curry and I went for the gin-katsu, which was pretty fancy. They were really 'extra' about everything, including bringing me a bowl of sesame seeds and a pestle. They instructed me to grind the seeds to my liking and then top with the donkatsu sauce and mix it together for a custom sauce experience. They also brought me rice in a big stone bowl and made a whole big deal out of fluffing it up and serving it to me.The food was delicious but I have to say it was a bit pricey. I don't know that there's really a big difference between the cuts of pork that makes it worth the price difference so I'd just say opt for the cheaper, fattier one since I think it's more flavorful and whatever, you're eating deep fried food anyway, might as well go for the more caloric option and go all out."}, {"review_id": "Dw2MNDJUNjDrZco6YJsbyQ", "user_id": "aX4Zs1tHhIe3xz-CLm8CSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "So good!!! Lived up to the hype for me - I went for dinner twice in a 4 day trip and I didn't have to wait to be seated :)) Ordered the katsu curry tenderloin set both times. It's perfectly crispy with a not too heavy curry sauce and rice with a nice texture. Â The curry comes separately on the side so the tonkatsu doesn't get soggy or anything. The cabbage salad and miso soup that come with it are all you can eat. I didn't have room for seconds though. Will definitely go back next time."}, {"review_id": "NQg7Yx_8nxcAhC5v_xwkTw", "user_id": "KVLOJ2Aj_EndhlhugfwRnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Ive been waiting so long to try out bairin and Im so glad I chose an off night to experience their yummy food. Upon arriving me and a friend were seated immediately. The restaurant is pretty small and youre basically seated elbow to elbow to the adjacent table, but I dont mind cause the food and service definitely made up for the lack of space. Everything is moderately priced anywhere from 18-35 a plate or so but all the dons and katsus come with side of rice, pickled cabbage, your choice of entree and a side salad w/miso soup. Tonight I ordered the seafood katsu set, everything down to the croquette was so good. I really didnt think the plate was gonna be so filling but it totally was and I was truly shocked at the size of the shrimp, those suckers were fat (the didnt miss any meals). Another really cool point was they give you a little dish filled with sesame seeds that your grind up & add either a mild or spicy katsu sauce. *drools* We also had ordered an appetizer fried calamari, always so yummy but what got me was the little shaker that contained like a curry powder to sprinkle over the freshly fried calamari. Sooo kawaiiii. Key point* check your bill cause they do add a \"service charge\" on which suffices for gratuity. So unless you want to add extra tip, its already added."}, {"review_id": "wi6JUUYL2SxoOjqRIQUTnQ", "user_id": "cBKEROUF8HFeO7rPBKb4Og", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Everything about this meal was delicious.We all had our own meals, my husband had the taro bun burger and it was super flavorful.

And YUM - it was probably one of the best that I've tried so far!The restaurant itself is intimate, with a few larger tables and bar seating along the open kitchen. Ginza Bairin is pretty popular, so come early or call in for a reservation if you have a group over four people. Also be sure to park in the Bank of Hawaii tower and ask for validation. We made a rookie mistake and ended up paying $12 for valet - boo. :( From the friendly staff to the mortar and pestle grinding going on at the other tables, I've never been to Japan before, but I loved the seemingly authentic atmosphere of the restaurant.My boyfriend and I both opted for the katsudon and wasn't disappointed. The katsu had the perfect crispiness and was lovingly topped by a gooey egg. The sauce itself had the perfect balance of sweetness and didn't come off overbearing in the dish. I also appreciated that the katsudon came as a complete meal, with miso soup, salad and pickles. Lets just say we both walked out veeeery full after our meal. :)Prices are a little higher, but is equivalent to what you'd see on the Waikiki strip. Our total meal ended up being a little over $30, which seems like a lot for something as \"simple\" as katsudon. But the quality matched the price and if we had the chance, we would've loved to come back and try their infamous tonkatsu."}, {"review_id": "sOMSPhSYODuiu9cmB0fmhQ", "user_id": "Pzw5rZdwhYfF2uIrPYZk8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "We were incredibly lucky to be seated without a reservation!

I was intrigued that the pork had the fat, similar to how one would see in pork belly. I didn't really like it, but interesting... They also had a \"loco moco\" tontaksu, where they used curry instead of gravy. It was served in a stone pot, so the rice got crispy and was yums.Service is super on point, as it is a Japanese institution (Japanese places place such high priority on service and customer satisfaction).

I really like their cabbage salad because it's thinly sliced. Get it with the sesame dressing. So good!They also give you sesame seeds to grind up once your seated.
