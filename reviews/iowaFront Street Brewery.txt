The beer selection is wide the food is great and the service is very attentive. I'm trying to think of something I don't like about this place and I simply can't think of anything.I'm from Joliet, IL and happened to run across this place a few years ago while working nearby. Knowing I was going to be back in the area, I had to stop by again. So, if you're in the area and would like to have a good meal and some cold craft beer, this place is for you."}, {"review_id": "605nG0YnixFPPrBLMZ_ivw", "user_id": "nLpwy59k_cp9JB9wpiy-CA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Hey yo!We walked on down to Front street after coming into town for a wedding. I researched the best brewery with food, and my findings brought me to the muddy banks of the OLE MISS. (Okay, it wasn't muddy at all, but the ambiance was great.) We sauntered on in on a Friday night, seven people strong. We were instantly seated and greeted. I wanted to see what they were all about, so I ordered a sample of everything on tap (besides water, I didn't need any of that...there was plenty of that in the river!) It was very tasty, and I was partial to a porter and a stout. I would have grabbed a growler, but time got away from us that weekend. Everybody at our table ordered food (mostly burgers and salads.) My wife and sister got the beer cheese soup, but it was awful. Something smelled off about it, and when I took a taste, my red flags went off right and left. We called the waiter over, and he took them back. He offered an apology (which was appreciated,) and they ordered something else off the menu. Overall, I really dig this place and I would recommend it to anybody looking for some craft beer and rub-a-dub grub!"}, {"review_id": "3Y3CawJwCBzWPuBNKUuUAw", "user_id": "Z5W674ZiMpM5ZIIajzt87w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/16/2017", "text": "Solid dining experience, good staff, and easy to access location.It was a little odd to not have signage as I walked in to direct is to seat ourselves or wait to be seated--and no one to greet us as we walked in--but the staff was very polite and cheerful when we say at the bar and asked what seating there was. Service was prompt and super nice. Food was good and very Midwestern (not heavy on the spices), and the beer was solid. A little loud for easy convo, too, but not a bad auditory space. Not gourmet, but a solid pub experience.I would go back, and would recommend."}, {"review_id": "HtRZYTWWnS4SYUYHfZEdRw", "user_id": "ypsvSeMVTCCA7mpL954gqg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "Wow. Good beer on tap to start our visit off right. I ordered the smoked gouda steak burger with a fried egg on top. I don't take it lightly when I say this was one of the best (if not, the best) burgers I've ever had. All the flavors working together were unbelievable. I'll probably compare any burger I eat going forward to this one, which is unfair to any other because this was so good. Well done Front Street Brewery!Went back for the second night in a row. Gotta love business trips. I had the pulled pork sandwich. It came with BBQ sauce, coleslaw, and house pickles. It was amazing! I doubt this place has a single bad thing on the menu."}, {"review_id": "h-txi3qOwfugur4wrCCs-A", "user_id": "k59WKPc1P1E5rwyOHiPHuQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Ok I want to say after driving through Iowa with an amazing amount of angry drivers on 80- this brewery was an awesome find.  Excellent service, very good beer choices, great taste and excellent service. Much like other mid states they have a love for the oldies, music wise, what can I say? Could I ask why other than poor road surfaces why is everyone so aggressive?

Last time I was here the place was on the other side of a sandbag wall from the overflowing river. It was much better this time around.Parking for Front Street is on the other side of the street in a private lot which then requires you to cross the street at the intersection. The place seemed smaller than I remembered it, but in the end I don't think it had changed. With that said the dining room isn't very big. A few bar stools and high tops and about 10 booths/tables. So get there early or you will be waiting. There were a couple of TVs behind the bar for sports viewing.The food was still fantastic. I got the breaded tenderloin that came with their in house made hefeweizen mustard aioli. It was a very good sandwich. The aioli was a little thin which meant it ran all over the place when you picked up the sandwich but the flavor was worth the mess. It was served with a side of fires. Others in my party got hamburgers and they were both happy with their selections.The beer wasn't quite as memorable this time around. My first one was an imperial stout which I thought was a little thin and under carbonated. I then went with a double IPA which was decent but not mind blowing. My friend who is also a beer lover felt the same with his selections. Just ok but not out of this world by any means.Still a great spot in Davenport for great food and decent beer. I don't make it over to the quad cities often but this will still be a must stop whenever I do again."}, {"review_id": "qdeHXZ-p1DpMpK6oFLKkBg", "user_id": "saooOqCMJfLMhb09BfMIEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/20/2017", "text": "Tasty burger and a martini for under $20 (before tip) was a tasty choice for dinner. I opted for the black and blue burger, which had  very tasty blue cheese crumbles, and was cooked just as I ordered. The fries were crisp and hot, and service sitting at the bar was very good. The server prepared my martini and then didn't think she had enough to top off the glass, so she shook up an additional mix and added it - nice touch. Definitely worth a try."}, {"review_id": "sqq214366wU7zvqABC5IUA", "user_id": "zmNtZJGeyuMRcvLBmY0_SA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/18/2016", "text": "Chill place. Just came in for a few beers with coworkers but we had a good time.Full bar. We didn't get any food. Think we missed the kitchen close. Took a few photos though so peep those. Seemed like normal bar food. You've got tables. Booths. High tops. Sit at the bar if you want. Staple beers maybe four of them. Two or three rotating seasonals. The beers they have are great though. Had the IPA and the local Davenport something (name escapes me.) Both some of the better beers I've had. And I travel A LOT for work. Bartender was polite and suggested good beers. Locals seemed fun and the waitress interacted with everyone. Came in about forty minutes before close so we didn't get the \"full experience.\" But I will definitely be back here my next trip to Davenport.

The waitress was extremely personable and helpful. The menu had a lot of classic dishes with very unique additions which I enjoyed. I had a guacamole burger that was delicious- the bun was perfectly toasted and the burger was extremely juicy. I also had a side of the macaroni cheese that just might be one of the best I've ever tasted, which is strange since the green onions gave it such a new taste. It was a little dark inside though, and I wish there was a better view of the Mississippi. Overall, extremely pleased with the food and atmosphere of this place.

Gosh, I love Front Street's Cherry Beer. I tried it a little less than a year ago when visiting my friend in Davenport. I thought about it every day since (maybe not quite, but close). I was so excited to go back a few weekends ago and try it again. It did not let me down and was just as good as the first time. I have also tried their Vanilla Porter which is equally as good. Can we mix the two? I mean not to tell the brewers what to do, butttt.....I think I might be on to something here. The space is cool and the bartenders are always friendly and up for conversations with us. We took in a birthday cake and were there on a scavenger hunt and the bartender enjoyed the time and celebrated with us. It's a great spot to stop after walking or biking along the river and would be great to sit on the patio in the summer time. I can't wait until my next visit. I will stock up on growlers so I never have to go this long without again."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/front-street-brewery-davenport?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
