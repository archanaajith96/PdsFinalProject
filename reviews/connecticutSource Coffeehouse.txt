Great drinks and service!! Cozy and relaxing atmosphere. I wish this place were in New York City!! We stopped by here on the way back to New York. There are enough seats and tables and it is pretty spacious inside. The barista was friendly and willing to help us to choose drinks. We got latte and earl grey milk tea with lavender syrup. The latte has a good flavor and it was very smooth. I felt like it was home made latte. The earl grey milk tea was amazing. The scent of earl grey and lavender was awesome and the sweetness was perfect for me. It's good for working, studying or chatting. Very relaxing and cozy ambience. Ask for their special or signature drinks that are not on their menu. I want to come back here again!"}, {"review_id": "Asm26WfznSCqNJHo3wVwOQ", "user_id": "AfAvEKggpPpgifmKdHQRTw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "There are lots of coffee shops that serve great coffee, but there aren't lots of coffee shops that also make you feel at home. From the moment you walk in, you feel comfortable and at peace. This is the type of place you want to spend hours reading a good book or studying for a test. It's the kind of place you can go alone or bring your crew. We ordered an ice oat latte and a regular oat latte. Both were stinking delicious. Like liquid heaven. Can I have another please? Can't wait to come back and have another cup."}, {"review_id": "nd0RFEhukHg24l2DbCyoQA", "user_id": "krMpnfsxGf9NBeIBXgFobw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/26/2017", "text": "I stumbled into this coffee shop while waiting for my husband to finish work on a Saturday around noon. The ambiance is clean and has a lot of character. There were all kinds of people there meeting with friends, doing work and just enjoying their drinks and food. There are plenty of seats and tables to go around. The gentleman behind the register who took my order was very friendly. Every employee seemed genuinely happy to be there. I got a decaf soy latte. The foam art was adorable and the latte was delicious. I spent an hour or so here reading my book and I could have stayed longer. Some people ordered the avocado toast which looked delicious. The different types of teas also looked very good! I will have to come back and try something new!"}, {"review_id": "g62dfSvgEkifTsx2qnFl0Q", "user_id": "Q4uH1y1tVgYX1K9KZtFf2Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/2/2017", "text": "I have driven by tons; finally checked it out. This place is a lot cooler and better than it looks from the outside. It had a peaceful vibe, kinda neat and tidy feeling, NOT that slightly hippy/dingy vibe that a lot of coffee houses have (ya know, half-dying plants, shredded couches, weird bad art or sale...) The atmosphere here was orderly and good for doing some computer work and nibbling on a bag of excellent granola. They bake their own pastries too, which looked good. The guy who took my order was groovy but/and super friendly and mellow.  Oh - and my latte was super!"}, {"review_id": "2N2KlnCXKqECYn50XtQGIQ", "user_id": "C69L05EY48iYih6nEQwGgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/29/2017", "text": "I'm not from here but stopped while I was in the area. Bright little coffee shop with a perfect location. The price is extremely reasonable -- I ordered a matcha latte with espresso and an iced mocha for $11. Whenever I order a matcha latte I worry about the quality, but this one was earthy and robust. The quality of the ingredients is probably the best I've had at any coffee shop and the barista put so much care into making each drink. Plus lots of puppies :) I wish there was somewhere like this near me."}, {"review_id": "UUYSXEa_bvn7tn6Gopw9AQ", "user_id": "NggD-YomjmRg7w5xBd_OLA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Great, honest, service.

OK place. The seating arrangement is tight and a little uncomfortably close to your neighbor.  Decent coffee. The food item they are calling a scone is nowhere close to being an actual scone but is tasty nonetheless. Negative vibe from the tattooed girl behind the counter.  I think non hippies and non hipsters are a bit unwelcome as she assumed without asking that my order was \"to go\" when there were several open tables and my preference was to sit.  The counter is L-shaped and she uses one side for payment and the other side for handing you your coffee.  Any deviance from this protocol is met with clear annoyance. Get over it!"}, {"review_id": "tGwcoWJl1SFGUnJnt8e8ug", "user_id": "av3w4v2MA2cMbstGfkmvgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "Awesome local spot!

I was trying to find a Starbucks off 95, and am thankful to Yelp search for including all nearby coffee shops in the area. Source was closer than a Starbucks, and it's super easy for 95 travelers.Source is cute with a friendly staff, and curated drink and food offerings. I opted for a pumpkin spice latte when the barista told me they were out of their homemade hazelnut paste. The latte was great. I also got a peach muffin, which was the perfect size and quite tasty.I'll be back when my travels take me nearby."}, {"review_id": "qzsO13EjXr8iN4ZhYrB3GQ", "user_id": "vb2xgYodT4WN43tMcnSfEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "Great little coffee shop , with really good Ethiopian blend on tap today.  Stopped in after dropping car for service on Scofield.  Much more interesting to wait here than in plastic dealership waiting room"}, {"review_id": "xq44lmM_AoFsVGVnb2TVwQ", "user_id": "nIlfAJwm28NFb1xAUj9O-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "It was my first time visiting Source and I loved it.

We did try a grain muffin w berries that was delicious  I'm so happy I've finally found a great cup of Joe!!! Locally roasted too!
