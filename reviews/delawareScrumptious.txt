If you are looking for kickass tasting food served by happy, attentive people, you will live it here.  We didn't know what to expect when we walked in - we are from out of town and found it on Yelp -  since the mismatched furniture and \"rustic\" space makes you wonder. But, we decided to give it a try and OMG are we glad we did. We started with Cubanos and Chai lattes to drink, both perfectly prepared.  We then went the more adventurous out and bypassed the raved about pancakes for the breakfast burrito with chorizo and the All Out Roti with chorizo with a side of seasoned veggies. Everything, EVERYTHING, was delicious. The side of veggies tasted like someone cut open a samosa and poured the delectable filling on my plate. The roti was amazing, especially with a dash of hot sauce to kick it up even further.  The burrito was huge, delicious and perfectly pressed/grilled for the added crispy touch. Thank you, Scrumptious, for capping off a great weekend getaway. We will be back!"}, {"review_id": "WRmx0_-rzhRKwExBPGhvnQ", "user_id": "eYg71ima9LQxZDrfMfB0Kw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Came here for breakfast with a girlfriend and we really enjoyed the healthy options here. They offer a wide variety of breakfast dishes to smoothies, milkshakes, lattes, and even frozen yogurt! We opted for the make your own omelette dish with a side of toast. Prices were reasonable, omelette was good and lattes were just right. Nothing to complain here!Definitely would come back if I'm ever looking for breakfast in the area again!"}, {"review_id": "NclQOFRycPzol3axnjTEhw", "user_id": "I8QoXihPCA-Jq72uDH-oAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Totally impressed by this small establishment. We came in for breakfast on a Sunday morning and I was worried when I walked into the shop and found out that they also serve froyo besides coffee and sandwiches. I haven't had much of good experience on places that are trying to do too much.Turned out to be the food was delicious and the ingredients tasted fresh. I got the hash with turkey and avocado. My bf got banana pancakes. We both really enjoyed the food. I also got Vietnamese coffee and it was tasty!The server was also really friendly!!!"}, {"review_id": "yNLHaFFMxKFZWqm1MgjgvQ", "user_id": "jWN-BgwCh210KzFUmDi53A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/13/2018", "text": "Scrumptious is very cute and very intimate. Not an obvious first choice for breakfast but I was pleasantly surprised about their breakfast selection. The food was good, the coffee a little burnt, and the entire place was empty. There was a bit of a fish smell through the block that randomly drafted into the small establishment, and that was a little unsettling but when you are two doors down from an oyster house, not sure what you can do. There's a little lot in the back of the store that makes parking a little easier"}, {"review_id": "RPMOGEni6QHvUmstDOTnJw", "user_id": "CBKUo1-wTTTEZ7MRYWWitA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "What a sweet little gem.

Came in Saturday late morning for some brunch. We were delighted that they had outdoor seating in the back since it was an amazing day.My bf ordered the hass Benny  w a small Cubano and I opted for the shrimpin' on rye toast. Mine was ok; the shrimp were baby shrimp like the kind I would feed my pet turtle but over all it tasted good. I would suggest to ask for the toast or tacos to be on the side since it gets soggy pretty fast. My bf let me try his hass Benny and it was very good; eggs a bit too runny for us but we liked the combo of flavors. The cubano tasted like any other coffee. Service was very good, our waitress was sweet and speedy and was even training someone. On our way out we were full but not full enough to skip out on the froyo!!!! We shared a cup of 1/2 mango 1/2 raspberry and topped it with just popping boba! They actually had 4-5 diff flavors of popping boba which I liked and had a good selection of froyo flavors. The mango was perfect sweet and fruity, the raspberry was surprisingly creamy! Well will come back to this place esp if it's a nice day so we can dine outside, just being inside to get froyo and pay we already smelled like food."}, {"review_id": "fiZxrqWGLiiw16pJ5Aegcw", "user_id": "dhLizr4a2oydrv15y56r0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2017", "text": "This had the the best breakfast burrito I have ever had! And I have been to Texas ya'll!  Since we missed breakfast at our hotel we searched high and low and stumbled across this (what I like to call) backslash spot. So it's a breakfast/ice cream/bubble tea etc. restaurant? Doesn't matter! Thank you fellow Yelpers who said to go for the chorizo. It definitely rounded out my burrito. There was a little spice. I was nervous at first, but it went well. It was a little large so I'll have the other half later. The meat lovers was perfectly portioned and stuck to its name. I think anything on this short menu is good and worth a trip. It doesn't seem like the pancake type of greasy spoon so i don't know if I'd choose that, but it's there if you really need it. The water was tap and I was alright with that."}, {"review_id": "xJF0eADcbjSXoaIHtytWKw", "user_id": "uSX12EdID5CCJtmxlePkUg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "Just tried their Hass Benny breakfast sandwich and it was delicious!

Don't waste your time. This place is an absolute JOKE. I can't believe they are even in business. They probably won't be for long, which is a shame, because Wilmington needs good restaurants. Unfortunately, they are poorly managed.Came in to this place to take a break from life, to do some work, to eat. I was (and am) starving. Had never been here before. Ordered a simple BLT and a Peach Tea Snapple. Sounds simple, right? I wish that was the case...The kid with long hair was outside unloading packages or something, with the \"Manager.\" He came in to take my order and never washed his hands before ringing me up or making my food. Issue #1. Major food safety problem. Absolutely disgusting.Issue #2. My Snapple was cracked...literally he gave me a bottle of Snapple that was cracked...and the lid didn't \"pop\" when I opened it. Ok, maybe an honest mistake, I returned it and asked for another.I wait and he brings me my food. No mayo on my BLT...none. Who the heck eat a BLT w/o mayo? But that's not it...check out the pics of how this was assembled. My 6 year old could (and does!) make a better sandwich than this. Heck, I think my 4 year old could. I go up and ask for mayo. The guy looks at me strange. Then proceeds to get me some. The \"Manager\" walks in and asks what he's doing. He tells her. She says, \"You ALWAYS put mayo on BLT's.\" As he's getting it, she comments that the low boy fridge feels warm. Great--you are holding mayo in a refrigerator that is \"warm.\" Awesome.I try to salvage this \"sandwich.\" I'm remaining calm. I just couldn't do it. Couldn't eat it. Tried putting salt and pepper on it. Nope. The whole thing is beyond repair and a disgrace. I cannot believe someone would serve that kind of product.It gets better. I pack up my bag and take my food and unopened snapple up to the counter. I tell the guy, \" I can't eat this.\" \"What's wrong?\" he asks. I say, \"Look at this? This looks and tastes awful. I can make this at home easily. I came here because I didn't want to have to.\" He apologizes (I give credit where credit is due and I'm proud of him for apologizing, but annoyed at him for the following). I ask for a manager. He tells me she's outside. (Seriously dude, you are telling me I can walk outside to talk to your manager?) Well, I walk outside. She's nowhere to be found. It's raining. I get in my car and call the store. He answers. I tell him I can't find her. He says she should be in a Black Jeep. Maybe she's left. I say, \"You're asking me to find someone in a black Jeep to resolve this? Is that what you're asking me?\" He says, \"Maybe she left.\" I said, you know what, please have her call me, I am sure my caller ID is on your phone.\"Well, it's a few hours later and...guess what...no call from the Manager. Why am I not surprised. I hope the OWNER sees this. You need to get it together, whoever you are. Your store is a disgrace. No one does anything...ANYTHING...with excellence anymore.This place get 1 star simply because Yelp forces you to give at least 1."}, {"review_id": "3KB2ziJ1s9r5lKHxg560Nw", "user_id": "etBiIkVxpcr_N2qA74-F_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "The French Toast with walnuts and blueberries was delicious!!!!  Coupled with an almond milk latté and very relaxing environment in the patio.

Came in sometime around 1 p.m. for a breakfast sandwich to go as I needed to get back to Philly but was too hungry to wait till I got home. There was only one young lady working, a slender brunette with pink plugs. She was very cheerful and conversational, patient with me as I am vegan and was trying to decide what to get. I decided to build my own breakfast sandwich and she was super kind about it. Sometimes with other places I've requested to do so and have been met with a little bit of attitude, but not her! While she made my sandwich, she engaged me in friendly conversation and the end result only took about 5 minutes. She gave me hot sauce and napkins with a fork and knife, everything was perfectly made and well-placed. I'll come back again next time I'm in Delaware."}, {"review_id": "7ZjNLPhETDLuAoT9TxBAbA", "user_id": "5Cs5l1u5bOZ-ljPPN_7eqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "One of my favorite places for brunch.
