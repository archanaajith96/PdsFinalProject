The atmosphere is perfect for dates, business, singles, families, etc. We begin with the three sauces; we chose verde tomatillo, house tomato, and tres chiles. The tres chiles is served warm. All three salsas were phenomenal.  For my entree I chose the shrimp and brie quesadilla from the small plates menu. It consisted of a grilled quesadilla stuffed with brie and Monterrey jack cheese, shrimp, and a side of Chile-mango chutney. I ordered a side of sour cream but I am glad that I did not use it. The chutney was spicy with the perfect sweet.My boyfriend ordered the 3-cheese steak nachos from the small plates menu as well. Do not be fooled by the, \"small plate\" label. He could only eat half of the serving. In the past we ordered their house margarita and it was great but we did not this time.We really enjoy this different Tex-Mex restaurant so close to home."}, {"review_id": "aoNkG4tT1SVrKqZl6xqCjQ", "user_id": "ofr2B-0VtKkqGfaug9aBsA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Everything was too spicy for us - all three salsas, the tacos. Chips were ok but hard and oily. I guess if you don't pay $3.75 for their 'try three salsas,' then you don't get chips and salsa automatically?..We might come back on a weekday afternoon/early evening to try $3 guacamole and $5 margaritas, but it's kinda  outta the way.... We were seated outside so there was no decor to speak of, service was just meh. (More beans recommended as a side with bean tacos?...) And I HATE when the server says there's no rush on the check, then even when you say you're paying with cash and don't need change, they still take the little black folder right away - and then know how much you've tipped them... come on, be a bit more classy than this, people!  Maybe they just weren't taught these little things."}, {"review_id": "VzpnfkAUawzp9eZS339K6w", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "What to get: salsa sampler, cilantro lime riceService: 4/5Atmosphere: modern, trendy sit down, groupWait: 0 mins (Monday 1PM for 1)Parking: parking lot for plazaThe Experience:A nice, modern Tex Mex spot in a shopping plaza. Parking is found between the shops or behind the main strip (which I recommend since there's a lot more space out there). As you would imagine, weekday lunch had ample seating and service was very quick with few diners eating at one time.I love that you can do a sampler of 3 salsas. The chips are long strips, so you can get a bit of each salsa each time. The zucchini is interesting and topped with pumpkin seeds. I also had the Caribbean mango salsa, which was sweet. Lastly, the house tomato salsa to balance the others was a solid choice. For one person, it seemed like there were more chips than there was salsa, but I was barely able to finish the majority on my own (with an entree too).I also ordered 3 fish tacos. They're not incredibly large, but I had cilantro lime rice and black beans to add to my meal. I finished that rather quickly. Probably my favorite part was the cilantro lime rice to be honest.Nice place to visit when passing through. I wouldn't call it a unique part of Little Rock, but it was a good meal."}, {"review_id": "UY-5AxsmpPq73Y9oRcCOwg", "user_id": "olhya_OeeYQZeldDmWHnPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "The food was FANTASTIC!!!

It's located within the Little Rock Promenade. It is kind of an odd location, but this place has AWESOME food! We were immediately seated when we walked in. The place was packed and felt very cozy when we walked in. We started off with three salsas. We chose the house, the tres chiles, and the verde. They were all scrumptious. The tres is a little different because it is warm. I ordered the grilled chicken tacos with the cilantro lime rice and the jalapeño slaw. My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas with cilantro lime rice and the black beans. Everything was beautiful and tasted great!Our service was amazing and that can make all the difference in this business. We will definitely be here again.

We were in town for a long weekend and were staying at a hotel 10 minutes away, and Local Lime came up on Yelp as a recommended dinner option, so we tried it. They were able to take our party of 2 at the bar right away (though there was a 10 minute wait for a table, and this was around 7pm on a Sunday night). Bartender was super friendly and gave us good recommendations.We enjoyed everything we tried, starting off with the frozen margaritas. They have some fun salsa options and the guacamole is excellent. For main courses, we tried the chicken fajitas and chicken tacos, and both were great. We probably over-ordered for two people -- we left suuuper full and scrapped our dessert plans -- but no regrets because the food was excellent.The restaurant has a cool vibe, very modern and fun.

Got a house margarita which was decent, but a little heavy on the sweet and sour. I chose the Pescado De La Cruz their house specialty which was tasty, real heavy on the raw onion and tomato but none the less was good. Nothing was overwhelming like OMG so good, but it was alright. I'd def come back once I make my rounds of all the other choices in LR.

Went on a Saturday night  without a reservation. There was about a 45 minute wait but plenty of space at the bar, which has full service.Ordered salsa, guacamole, margaritas, fajitas, and tacos - and they were all WONDERFUL. Large portions, delicious and unique flavors, and a very large menu of possibilities.The space itself is hip and fun - big booths, candles, large leather bar stools. Only issue is prices - we did order a good amount but it was almost $70 for two people, which was a lot for similar types of restaurants.Was only in Little Rock for a night but if I went back I'd definitely hit this up!!"}, {"review_id": "3CfVeGxjT2HYyQ5aXtuyrA", "user_id": "A5AQzlWE7mYUK9eYbP1_Iw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Great salsa trio sampler...Chipotle salsa was the best! Delicious char grilled shrimp tacos and pomegranate margarita was top notch! Little loud to have conversation.
