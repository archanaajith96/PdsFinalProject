The first time we went we tried other stuff and it was fine, but on our way out we noticed that everybody was eating amazing looking food out of a bubbly cauldron-looking thing and had major food envy. The next time we went back we followed the crowd and were not disappointed! It is so good that I heard the Blue Iguana stole their dish and is serving it as well. Fine. But if you want the original (as far as I know), hit Chilie-Tepin. It is amazing."}, {"review_id": "rE0u1dRDCFw-VoZEkfofsw", "user_id": "zqrv1anL6mgEy6N_mIJTVw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I ate here a couple of days ago, and have almost forgotten about it completely...not a good sign. On a strong recommendation I attended. I think my expectations were too high and I briefly forgot my life rule that all Mexican is basically the same, whether it comes with a $20 or $2 price tag. I got the carne asada, which was good, but forgettable.The service was outstanding and because we were eating at my favorite grandpa time, 5:00 sharp, we were about the only ones there and received great attention."}, {"review_id": "APF2jwrK_Oe4ZrFri8JY7w", "user_id": "-J_lFd8bB4yk8LkPKv13Vw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I would love to give them 5 stars but unfortunately the size of their tables to a group of 4 people was a BIG turn down because of the size of their plates, most of us ordered the parrilada. It just doesn't make sense, they serve this amazing food to which their portions are generous but it's frustrating because you're crammed up and there's literally no space to use. We wanted to order other things but couldn't because there was no space in our table.As a group I wouldn't recommend because of the size of their table, but for a date night I would since their atmosphere is very Latin and has a lot to offer culturally."}, {"review_id": "MuFOgzjDd7k-Fjj3Mlkr9g", "user_id": "CV-BtcQ8wAnlJ9ro5o0khw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Go with the Molcajetes! It's super super yummy. It has green tomatillo sauce smothered underneath the bowl that is all the goodness. It can feed two people if you wanted to share. I also recommend the Toritos for appetizers - yellow peppers stuffed with shrimp and cheese. The restaurant brings in a lot of the natural light which simply makes me happy.

The hostess was not overly chatty, but kind. She seated us at a corner table right under a speaker blasting Sam Smith. It felt a little odd in that space, but thankfully once more customers arrived (we got there as soon as they open at 11am) the music was turned down a bit and changed.The complimentary chips are served warm, on the thicker side, lightly seasoned and accompanied by spicy and fresh-tasting salsa. They don't skimp on the portion, and offered more twice.We ordered the parrillada for two. This is an astonishing amount of food, and the presentation is great. The cheese used in the quesadillas was gloriously melty and I loved the refried beans. The seasoning on all the meat was similar, the chicken being my favorite. The brothy beans had excellent flavor, I really liked the charred onion, and with an extra side of lettuce it all came together as a very tasty lunch. It was also a steal at $25. Only negatives: I found the rice greasy, and I did not enjoy the shrimp, but I don't like shrimp.Parking in this area stinks, though for me was a non-issue so early in the day. If you dine here at night prepare to do some hunting.Now, I wouldn't say I was disappointed. The food was great, the portion was more than enough for two (and could easily feed three if you're gorging yourself on chips and salsa prior to your meal like I did). I think I expected it to feel a little more authentic, and while I wouldn't say this was straight Americanized it seems like they were playing it safe and trying a little too hard to appeal to the masses. If I was searching for authenticity, though, perhaps I ordered the wrong dish. I'd like to return and try the mole as well as a combination plate. I think this restaurant is an excellent dinner choice for a large group as you could share the parrillada and/or molcajete. Drink options, while limited, featured yummy-sounding margaritas and seemed inexpensive. I'll return."}, {"review_id": "RvOV9zvhS4j9Ok7EHq0X0g", "user_id": "zFVBIOECiSpDb-e1WZOFVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "This place is amazing. Here are the highlights:1.) Patron Margaritas for only $8. That's unheard of!2.) The food is absolutely delicious and fresh!3.) The food is also really reasonably priced. You can order a whole mound of food for under $10.4.) The servers are friendly and quick.5.) You are given a bowl of chips and spicy salsa when you sit down which is refreshed during your meal. I recommend trying the chile relleño with beans and rice and the fajita camarones! This restaurant is slightly removed for being in Salt Lake City downtown but well worth the trip!

There was a 45 minute wait for two as of 6pm, and as others have said they don't take reservations. Pro Tip: we did call to put our name on the list before we left the hotel so by the time we got dressed and sauntered over there, we only needed to walk around the block and our beeper went off by the time we got back.We liked our table, as it was roomy with plenty of room to sit but it was by the kitchen so there was a constant stream of power-walking staff carting food and plates back and forth. If you want to see the strong work ethic of minorities in action, look no further than this restaurant. These young people know how to hustle and keep hustling (unlike most white American young people). If you know someone who is anti-immigrant, take them here, followed by someplace with young white staff who can't be bothered to look up from their phones. What a difference between the lack of hustle at other places and here.The noise level was pretty loud, but we could hear each other without shouting. There is an interesting wall made of old canned food tins and some okay art, otherwise the decor is more functional than attractive.As a person who lives in California I have had a lot of Mexican food, including in Mexico, so I have a high standard compared with someone who only eats it once in a while. I had the carnitas and my dining companion had fajitas. I do like that they do the traditional plates of meat with rice, beans, salsa and guac served with warm tortillas. They offer a choice of flour, corn or some of each for the tortillas. They do have black beans if you prefer that to refried beans. My carnitas was seasoned well and properly cooked but very average. The beans, rice, pico de gallo and guac also felt very usual/average. One thing I liked was their house made salsas. The salsa served with chips right when you sit down has a good heat level to it. They also have an excellent darker salsa that they serve with the platters. I had to ask for more as I had about one quarter of a teaspoon of salsa in my tiny metal side serving dish. It is smoky and spicy while still tasting good and complementing the food. If you a connoisseur of Mexican food, you will find Chile-Tepin to be, well, Chile-Tepid. Food is average and borderline bland, although perfectly acceptable, as nothing was swimming in grease or improperly cooked. If you just eat Mexican food once in a while, or if Chevy's or Chli's is the kind of Mexican food you like, this is a place that won't disappoint you. For me, who was hoping for a higher level of creativity and flavor, it was disappointing."}, {"review_id": "pbOIOXuVR_JIYQubAWF-UQ", "user_id": "g0xNDrIj0OdgcxWTJpq3Bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "The chips and salsa is very good. But chips are a little on the hard side but they're tasty. If you look fajitas listen up. The steak \"res\" is tough and hard to eat if your missing teeth like me.  This is not an issue at most Mexican places that I go to. Most the time it's very tender. I switch to a chicken dish trying that out.Everything taste and looks high-quality except for their steak. For some reason it did not come out on a sizzling plate like most restaurants do.Portions are  small for fajitas but the price is ok.  Don't ever be afraid to send things back to the kitchen. Sometimes they do make mistakes. And boy oh boy did they ever fix your mistake. He sent out a double portion of steak fajitas and chicken fajitas. The steak was extremely tasty and very tender this time around. I'm changing my review from three stars to 5 stars!I don't think I've ever had such good customer service from the kitchen Of a Mexican restaurant. This might be my new favorite Mexican restaurant.So food came out hot fresh this time everything worked out. I think on the menu they should offer a double portion for their hungry or patrons."}, {"review_id": "G8xU1FxGDYcxb7W4NNz1iw", "user_id": "Ovx0u5ZT2iawEDaPXACBWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "The carne asada here is out of this world!  Real cool atmosphere, sweet location with a lot of natural light, awesome service, & slam dunk on the fried ice cream made in house"}, {"review_id": "957pYvv0ISE0IlMNGf_p0Q", "user_id": "ZKK8sY_twEF9qe2jh_ngkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Great food and nice atmosphere to eat.

(I'd like to attribute it to growing pains, but they've been open for awhile now.)There were only four of us in our party, and were told it would be a 40 minute wait which seemed steep even for a Friday night but no problem, it was a happy night and we were fine to sit and chat in their nice waiting area (though I wish they would have offered us drinks or something while we waited.)When I finally checked an hour later where we were on the list, I saw that our name had been crossed off because they had \"called\" it already and nobody answered (but we were literally sitting right there on the bench, a few feet away from the hostess booth, waiting with bated breath because we were so hungry!) When we finally were seated, the manager rushed over and dropped off a (what I thought was complimentary since we hadn't asked for or ordered it) queso fundido - yum! - and rushed our margaritas over too. We thought we were in the clear, ate our delicious food, but then saw the charge for the queso on the bill! Whoa whoa whoa. You charged us for something we didn't even order?? I have never had that happen at a restaurant, ever. Maybe it was a mistake, but I wish it had been the other kind of mistake where they forget to charge you. Okay, so aside from that, I really loved the food. It was spicy, fun, fresh, tasty, full of flavor. Chips and salsa were nice. The queso fundido (melted jack cheese with chorizo) is served with fresh hot tortillas was to die for. I ordered the enchiladas (yum!) and the rice and beans were great too. The restaurant is bustling, loud, friendly, just like you want in a Mexican restaurant. Drinks are strong and cold. I just don't know if I can get over the service faux pas (x 2) that we experienced on our very first visit. It left a bad taste in my mouth, and with other excellent Mexican food in the valley, it would be hard to return."}, {"review_id": "qkEB6Un7PfwILbuJu-T40g", "user_id": "e3WdNnJuMXImPyjTkXxvFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "This place is delicious and incredibly cheap!
