I had cinnamon pullman french toast with dulce de leche mascarpone, maple syrup and raspberries served with a side of bacon. I also ordered a side of homefries with peppers and onions.The french toast was amazing. I have quite a sweet tooth and sugar for breakfast is a weakness. This breakfast fit the bill perfectly and had just the right balance of each of the components to come together. The side of bacon was a perfect savory accompaniment  to keep the taste buds from sugar overload. Unfortunately the homefries were not that great, nothing special about them, and lacking in flavor until I generously salted them. They didn't ruin my experience, I just won't order them again in the future. The service was good and the food came out in a timely manner. Also, random side note, the bathroom was lovely. I really appreciate when a restaurant has a clean comfortable bathroom."}, {"review_id": "rOXlu8VKoSKXetm8k5JMXA", "user_id": "v8o0BzeBiLAHAcWmDrzpfg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Family FriendlyService, including at a very crowded bar, was good.  Our waiter was great, always present when needed, but so unobtrusive he was practically a ninja.  The drinks were hit-or-miss.  There was a margarita with prosecco instead of triple sec, that was great.  The cinnamon sour was awful.  I asked for a sazerac, but they couldn't make it because they were out of absinthe.The food was good, we cot a couple of veggie burgers, the B Anthony and the one with avacado and jalapenos.  Both were pretty tasty.  My wife got a side salad that was delicious, and I got the onion rings which were nice and crispy.However, this is not a date night spot.  Two reasons.So many kids.  Holy cow, just everywhere.  Not the restaurant's fault I guess, but it would keep me away for sure.  And I have kids, nothing against kids in general, but not for date night.  Second issue, the noise.  Wow, amazingly loud.  And look around, it's obvious why.  All hard surfaces, including the bare concrete floor that's polished to a glossy sheen.  This is exacerbated, of course, by all those kids.  Makes sense I guess, good burgers and (I hear) good pizza, that's a recipe for family times.  ANd I'm glad they found their niche, they seem to be doing a brisk business.  It's just not for us.EDIT: Just remembered, when we called they said they don't take reservations for parties of two.  Duh, my fault.  That should have told me right there it's not a date night place."}, {"review_id": "haajuAfRHifXQm6EBw2STA", "user_id": "5bIyZD5Jf9f2BBDL90Duuw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "I have been a loyal customer of the Gate House for years. I usually get their delicious salads or pizzas but tonight I thought I'd try something different.I started with the blood orange cosmo per usual but ordered the Wellington Burger with a Caesar salad. Honestly, the salad rocked by world. They added little pasta pieces to it and the dressing was so rich and creamy. The Wellington was good but didn't overly excite me because the flavors weren't too intense. The pastry was cooked perfectly and my beef was medium well as requested but it was missing some oomph overall.My boyfriend got the tenderloin beef tips and they were so tender. Our meals came with a smashed potato and asparagus which complimented both dishes quite well.I'm glad I tried something new but I think I'll stick to my salads and pizzas because I always leave so happy after ingesting them!! :)"}, {"review_id": "CiYCT0TKw8lFZBMCDi-CCQ", "user_id": "hj7o_BPgj-HdLAxdKqdx-w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/20/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've been back a few times since they've moved to their newer, larger location in the Village Gate. I have a nostalgic longing for the old Gate House space because it had been around for years and was a spot I went to for all occasions. The new space is bigger and brighter. There are mostly tables instead of booths with very heavy chairs. It's less cozy to me, but they needed the upgrade because it was so crowded and busy in the old space. Change is good.I must say, they once were known for their burgers, but I think the dishes that shine now are outside that realm -- the pizzas, the mac and cheese, the nachos! It's wonderful to see they've added a few gluten free options - GF crust for the pizzas and GF buns for the burgers. I've been on the hunt for great nachos for a while now. These ones are what I've hoped and dreamed for. The portion is huge - you can share this as a meal between 2 people or up to 6+ people for an appetizer. The chips seemed homemade - thick and crisp, well layered and topped with great marinated, flavorful ground beef, cheese sauce, plus sriracha sour cream... but the kicker is the pickled onions. Those babies are the shining star.I also am obsessed with their wood fired mac. I'll get it as a full size entree (always for the leftovers) or a side if I want it with something else. The caesar salad is great too as a side - they toss in radiatori pasta with it and it's a surprisingly yummy addition.I will consistently return for the mac and cheese and the nachos, and a low key spot to grab a meal during the week."}, {"review_id": "d5j3xrbWPo-HPtuYI4kOnw", "user_id": "PH02kJ4nz7DuHJSR9JcrzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "I love this area of Rochester. Very trendy with a lot of art to enjoy. The restaurant is a unique space and finely decorated. The food was great, and portions are excellent for the price. These plates were HUGE! Everyone enjoyed their food. I had the buffalo chicken tenders and mashed potatoes. The buffalo flavor was not overbearing--it was very finely balanced. It almost seemed as though the tenders were baked (I forget what the menu said). The Mac and cheese my friend got was a little less gooey than I imagined, but was still good. The only reason for the 4 stars is that our service was poor. Not once did our waitress check on us to see if we needed anything, and our entire table was out of water for a good 20 minutes. This continued even after the place settled down and was less crowded."}, {"review_id": "jTaDQseUupDzpa3OF28hXw", "user_id": "oicK5Gh7Sp5wZ5ulsDvMzw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN ROCHESTER!!! I come here for a majority of my special occasions (I came here for my going away party dinner and even my wedding dinner) because the food and experience here has always been so spot on. You can't go wrong with any of their burgers, but I highly recommend their auditorium and xerox pizza (please go back to having goat cheese on the xerox it was life changing and I don't know why they changed it) along with their famous sweet potato fries!!! They also have a bomb pear mule cocktail! This meal is legit my last meal on my yelp profile its that good!!"}, {"review_id": "23RgzOiJ_2mzEEjRAlZKwg", "user_id": "xLGD-Pysav8mX0AM9b8S1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/16/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Gate House is still a SOLID brunch spot that would satisfy everyone's cravings. My new favourite brunch item is the Chicken & Waffle Panini which is dressed with bacon jam! This reminds me of a crostini a friend of mine made last Friendsgiving. Now, it is a must for her to make it for every party!Anyhoot, the waffle is very fluffy and lightly sweetened -- as belgian waffles should be. The crispy chicken coated in the bacon jam is EVERYTHING! I will be craving this forevermore and at least once a month. Also a must try, is the Nutella pistachio muffin which is served more like a sweet bread slice.  So yum and totally worth every sugar gram and calorie. It qualifies as a side item so please skip the home fries..get them next time if you even crave them anymore."}, {"review_id": "IGDP54aek5tkARAYQVsB4Q", "user_id": "FBvie9YjT7jAkpm0PF8ybw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "Three words: SWEET POTATO FRIES!Hands down the greatest fries in all the land.

I went last night with a large group and my experience with the service and food was a complete 180!Service: Our server was attentive without being overbearing and our drinks/apps/entrees were brought out in an orderly manner. Food: I searched the menu for vegan options and found a  few. They offer a veggie burger alternative, but I'm simply over eating veggie burgers. I ordered a small plate ($14) of falafel, hummus, pita, olives, tabouleh, and grilled vegetables and W O W it was fantastic. The hummus was easily the best I've ever had and the falafel was delicious! I highly recommend this plate as an appetizer or entree because it's HUGE and lasted me two meals. I definitely see myself returning for this dish throughout the summer. Ambience: We were  in a somewhat separate area reserved for larger tables. It was warm but it was incredibly humid yesterday so I don't fault them for that. I hope my experience last night is representative of an upward trajectory for the Gate House because I do miss how they used to be!"}, {"review_id": "4C1Y0qn8o91-XByP7tYjjw", "user_id": "hSp2LrjLqJsPdkJC7FU2Ng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "love the Gate House!
