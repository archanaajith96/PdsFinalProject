Soups made from scratch. Fresh salads with house-made dressings. Decor is so polished, I never would have thought this was a family-owned business. Ingredients are fresh and there's a surprisingly large number of items on the menu. You can eat in or take out.Highly recommend this. It's close to the airport and I wanted to grab a quick meal before my flight. To think I almost settled for one of the fast food factories that populate this area. Now I'll look forward to my next trip to Green Bay."}, {"review_id": "qM_OLV-OWrFWBDO-09WgPg", "user_id": "p0CA3juBAIkSMI9hkE5FKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/22/2017", "text": "I've waited to review Not By Bread Alone. Their location is really close to me and I frequent them. They have been adjusting to new ownership and have improved the familiar brand. They run wild with catering which means they may not have everything left at the end of the day. So if you visit do it earlier to get the best selection. They have a location off Hansen that makes them a bit more than just a hop off the highway.  If you are looking for catering consider Not By Bread. They rank highly with service, fresh ingredients, creative offerings and holiday service. We have gone to them for Christmas, Easter and special holiday events. They take care to make certain the food is proportioned right, fresh and ready on time for any event you might have. The prices are fair, they can serve to virtually any budget. If you find yourself in front of their deli struck by all the choices, consider the cranberry egg salad, it will leave you thinking about unicorns and wizards it's that fantastic.It will not surprise me when they continue with amazing new food items. They need to offer a potato salad to the dine in crowd, maybe replace one of the free water jugs with a Not By Bread Alone punch. Oneida Street has little to offer that can compete. Not By Bread remains one of my favorites in Green Bay."}, {"review_id": "GnPeHHzQCNJHZm4dKbI5wg", "user_id": "vF5VemhRPS8e6tq9V038cw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "This popular spot in the perfect location has something for everyone.

A great place to grab a spinach salad with chicken and an iced coffee when away from home. We will definitely be making this a regular lunch stop when traveling.

My favorite is the carrot cake, so flavorful. Their savory breads are also fantastic. I usually pick up from them, and serve their Parmesan pull apart bread as an appetizer. In all the years I have bought things from them, I only had one problem, EVER, and they took care of it. Definitely will continue to be my go to place for cakes."}, {"review_id": "QfHzETsj6v_f-iI7sadA4A", "user_id": "cuX7Xk4-c--bluuaI9FVDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/14/2017", "text": "Went here during a busy lunch hour - service was fast and the sandwich I ordered was great.

I had the Kale & Quinoua Salad, it was good although i thought that price is a little expenisve for the portion you get. On a plate you get grilled chicken, kale that is blitzed up and quinoa, chopped red and yellow peppers and lastly grape tomatoes with the choice of dressing on the side or not, also you get a choice of wheat or white bread. But overall it was a great experience. I do tend to come back and try the other salads as well."}, {"review_id": "vZuudB3eotoKFL16dAmYFA", "user_id": "DathpJDBslSPqhBm-em6oQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "You have got to try the sausage bread.

Sandwiches are assembles right in front of you like they do at Subway. They also have a nice selection of soups and salads, and of course coffee, cappuccino, and lattes.I ordered a veggie sandwich which consisted of roasted sweet red peppers, Vidalia onions, portabella mushrooms, and parmesan pesto on freshly baked bread. I also ordered an espresso. The sandwich was seasoned and toasted to perfection. The sandwich was large enough to fill me up without needing a to go box. The price is reasonable for the quality. It's worth a return trip to experience more of their specialty sandwiches.Tip: If you check in on your mobile device, you will receive a free shortbread cookie, or just sign up for their rewards program to get a cookie."}, {"review_id": "Id0f1Hqnxdj4phJfdH998w", "user_id": "WV5XKbgVHJXEgw7f-b6PVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/1/2016", "text": "This place has everything going for it.
