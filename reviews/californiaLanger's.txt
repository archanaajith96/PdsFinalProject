The service has always been outstanding, a cup of water or coffee is never left half empty. The food is sensational. From the Lox and Bagels, to the French fries and Latkes. This place gets really busy, so either get here early or plan to wait a bit. Complimentary parking is offered off of 4th street and is so convenient.Hands down an amazing deli!!"}, {"review_id": "nyypy1aEiKet_olXL2lLQQ", "user_id": "CNkHhqe27OuCWThZ6cxPBg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Went on Monday @ 2:30pm and was seated at the bar area immediately. Now, this place isn't in the \"best\" of areas but I never felt unsafe walking to it from Downtown. Ordered the #19 with a cream soda. Pretty good stuff. The pastrami was tender/flavorful and the coleslaw in the sandwich provided a nice \"freshness\" to each bite. Very well composed and balanced sandwich. The sandwich was pretty filling, probably more than enough for most people. The pickle was good as well. However, just for a sandwich and a soda it was around $24 before a tip. To me, that is a bit much for what type of food this is. Yup, its good quality stuff but if the sandwich was more like $14 I'm sure they'd have more regular's because at their current prices its be more of a treat than an everyday occurrence. TLDR; Good stuff but ultimately I feel its too expensive for what it is thus 4 stars instead of 5."}, {"review_id": "_T2378usX6NFL8eUTepzkg", "user_id": "DPl0D_k4iIWh3Tv-8TAT_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "The Wannabe Ramen Snob laments the day he committed to buy Netflix stock, only to back out.  That was when streaming was new.  Now, all I seem to do is stream food shows on Netflix.  I recently watched Phil Rosenthal show.  I love him.  He's funny and entertaining... without the unoriginal vulgarity of Anthony Bourdain.  So when I saw Phil's Los Angeles episode highlighting Langer's as his favorite sandwich, I jumped at the opportunity to visit.This time, I chose wisely not to visit on a Sunday.  In the distant past I wrongly assumed a Jewish deli would observe the Sabbath.  Going on a weekday, there was no line.The decor is very old and needs a refresh.  They don't have to change the style, but just replace some worn out furniture.  But an added touch is seeing the owner behind the back counter--he reminds me of William Shatner.The menu seems varied, but I already knew what to order: #19, their signature pastrami sandwich.  The bread is double baked.  As I learned on the Phil show, the first restaurant was in Palm Springs, and they sourced the bread from LA.  So in order to bring day old bread back to life, Langer had to devise a way to cook it again, hence double baked.  The end result is phenomenal.   Crispy crust and snowy crumb.  The proportion of meat, slaw, and cheese is perfect.  The price of perfection is $17.Don't forget to validate your parking slip and good luck not getting robbed."}, {"review_id": "7Fobd6036NRGI-jrGRvz3g", "user_id": "SRqtqW96nDIxtDM7qc1YGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Just before noon on a Monday (4/2/18) I expected Langer's, a Jewish deli right next to MacArthur Park, to be exceedingly busy.But we were seated in a good old-fashioned booth right away. Service was great. Especially our waitress, Joan.The menu is extensive not to mention pricey. So since I'd never been there I went with the glorious #19 ($17.95). I didn't want to believe this combination would be so good. The pastrami was so tender and moist. Russian dressing works, but keep in mind I love mayo. So does the cole slaw which I usually hate. Swiss cheese. The rye bread - like my friend G said - sets this place apart for me. It was sliced nicely. It didn't overpower the sandwich. And it didn't fall apart.Pickles if requested are free. I don't know why my husband wanted boring fries, but he ordered some. Come to find out, I really didn't have room for any. Note the sandwiches don't come with sides. Save room for something better than barely crispy crinkle fries, though. Langer's cream soda is yummy ($3.75).TIPS- there is a kid's menu- free 90-minute parking w/validation at 7th & Westlake- they close early so come here for breakfast, brunch, lunch or a late lunch'18 Challenge #40"}, {"review_id": "vSMV7hJjtXA7d1hNthnLcA", "user_id": "jwNAw2CkV9obmNq_u4bbQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "This place is definitely an LA staple. It seems like nothing has changed since back then. There's a lot of history here. After years of idly sitting in my bookmarks my husband and I finally decided it was time to experience Langer's.We ordered the famous pastrami sandwich on rye. Boy oh boy. It definitely hit the spot. I'm not much of a mustard person, but mustard was my main choice of condiment. We shared one sandwich and it was enough to get both of us full. We also ordered a side of chili cheese tater tots. Yum yum yum! It paired really well with the pastrami. Overall, a great experience with the most friendly staff.

I admit its been a while since my last visit, taking for granted its continued existence. However, when Yelp friend Robert V. posted a photo of a wonderful looking sandwich from Langer's, It brought back delicious memories. So, took a flight into LA this morning and wanted to gorge on a #19 with a Coke. Although there was a line, it only made the anticipation that much better. Plus if you are solo or deux, the counter is not a bad place. Especially if you have the marvelous and remarkable Miss Sheila. Her effortless movements make the meal glide along perfectly. Thank you! Parking is down the street and if you order to-go, there is a quick spot right outside the restaurant on 7th where they'll bring out your to-go order!

Food took a while to come out but worth it. Decor/ ambianceIt is a very casual, antique diner feel to it. OverallI enjoyed my experience there.

The area has changed significantly since then, but the place continues to live on. The place is known for their hot pastrami sandwiches and the multitude of yelp pictures proves just that. I've been to Langer's a few times, but decided to try to popular and classic #19 on rye bread. It is basically a pastrami sandwich with Swiss cheese, Cole slaw, and a Russian style dressing. I also ordered a side order of chili cheese fries, which could have been a meal in and of itself. The pastrami sandwich was good and the rye was slightly crispy just the way I like it. Top that off with the delectable chili cheese fries, I was so insanely full! The first time I had langer's, I ordered the roast beef and it was a bit too oily and messy for my taste. The second time I ordered the turkey and it was alright. But by far, the most memorable experience will be the classic #19 with chili cheese fries. It is no wonder people order #19. So I recommend ordering what they are known for, the classic pastrami sandwich. Parking is a bit of a challenge, but they do have a parking lot. Just make sure to validate and it will be comped for two hours. Would I go there again? Sure, but would I crave it. I personally won't, but know people who may. Overall, I have three words: chili cheese fries.

The food came out hot with a nice presentation. My sandwich bread was lightly toasted, the meat was thinly sliced and cooked all the way through. The Au Jus was savory and full of flavor. The only things I did not enjoy all that much was my Brisket was cooked to a dry texture. The French Frys had an earthy flavor which my Daughter did not like. The bill put a dent in my wallet.
