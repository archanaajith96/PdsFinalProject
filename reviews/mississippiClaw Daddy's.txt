I wasn't disappointed at all. This place is a bare bones, get your food and go place and I mean that in a good way. Even my coworkers who are locals have never been here before said the food was really good. Not much space to eat in but the girl at the counter was nice enough to let us eat out back. The price for what you get is unbeatable. The only thing I would've changed was the level of spice. It needed to be kicked up a little. Other than that, an excellent meal. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in town for work and try some of the other things on the menu."}, {"review_id": "w4otoZF0JqYk1UH-X8hvZg", "user_id": "Bu07wZuvIwIdGYg09tBFSg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2016", "text": "This place is awesome!! They are always packed when I come to get Crawfish. You can either get them by the pound, live or boiled. Or you can get platters. Don't like Crawfish? No problem they also have Shrimp and sometimes Crab. They also have Potatoes, Corn, Sausage and Mushrooms. They also have bottled drinks, and if u are getting live Crawfish to fix them at home, they have the seasoning they used packaged too."}, {"review_id": "vm6-7-6Yy2ZonZp1_a_7_g", "user_id": "Y7g7kY0q61tFS138b7BpTg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/10/2017", "text": "If you want good traditional crawfish this is not the place. They brought them out put them in a box and sprinkled more seasoning on top of the already cooked crawfish. After seeing that I know this had to be a joke. So much seasoning had to brush most of it off.  After trying the first few I see why they sprinkled more season on them It had no season at all. If you have to season them after cooking them you didn't do it right."}, {"review_id": "1uCpyAHD7_kbswuKwMj_zg", "user_id": "4sktx-TKd5fUUWjK51gawQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2016", "text": "Go to place to pick up crawfish on the coast.  Very tasty and seasoned just right!

Shrimp and 10 pounds of crawfish. Both are over cooked. I called and got a smart mouth girl named Brittany on the phone who proceeded to tell me that they were not Overcooked and that they poke holes in their shrimp. Being from the MS Gulf Coast and eating shrimp for close to fifty years I know that when you can't peel the shrimp and it falls apart in your hands that's from one thing... BEING OVERCOOKED!!!! Beware! To many other nice places that do shrimp and crawfish right.
