Been here several times and the waitresses and waiters are not friendly. Sometimes they are slow to even attend the table, generally their attitude is unpleasant. They don't appear as if they are there to serve you-- i feel inconvenienced or awkward asking for things, sometimes they are rude. Sometimes they all convene by the cash register/ordering station and do not attend to tables when the restaurant is not busy. It's a shame because i think there is good food and the environment is unique, but i would never go here if there were other options."}, {"review_id": "5deWSEnMRo8PnSgcPwrRfg", "user_id": "mcCiXdEYAAT6yqeFcF0zKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "So much hipster and it just works.  Lots of beer on tap.  A nitro stout coffee also on tap.  Farm to table, primarily locally sourced foods, vegetarian and vegan options.  Comfortable mix of counter, high top and standard table seating.  Brick walls.  And it makes me oh so happy.A moment to profess my love to the vegan burger and kale slaw (also available as vegan).  One of the best vegetarian burgers I've ever had.  Rich in flavor, not crazy salty, not obviously all grain or portobello mushroom.  Served on amazing thick sliced, toasted bread, it was hearty and filling and delicious.  And why is this kale slaw not being hijacked and made everywhere?!  I will dream of that meal for months.Had the veggie taco as an appetizer as well.  Very flavorful with a nice medley of veggies.Everyone working was very relaxed (though attentive in service).  I showed up at exactly opening time, but The Hive was still ready to serve.  A number of other patrons filtered in during the weekday lunch hour, and I imagine there's an even bigger crowd during happy hours or live music performances.I love the Hive, you should too."}, {"review_id": "mgPQHnY0E0WzqynaNtCabA", "user_id": "C0PP2JtygHlxqNCA-Utn8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "So so so good! From service to the best burger and philly cheese steak I have ever had. I loved the Augusta burger that has a unique twist on pimento cheese. I paired this with never tried poutine and strongly urged everyone to try this French Canadian side of garlic fries with gravy and curds. Don't be afraid to try something new if you come here! All this went so well with a wonderfully fresh Caesar salad with homemade croutons and a delicious sour beer. There was such a large selection of beers to choose from and our server was a rockstar. Was so knowledgeable of both drink and good menus. I cannot wait to go again! I heard they occasionally have bands?

With over 70 different taps, there's bound to be a beer for everyone. They do have a bunch of local beers on tap from Georgia and South Carolina. Since some of the beers they carry are a bit limited, I'd go during happy hour to be able to try them at a reasonable price. Also, be on the lookout for tap takeovers from breweries all over the southeast. I haven't tried any of their cocktails personally, but I've gone with people who have and they've really enjoyed it.Their food is also pretty good and I think they're at least vegetarian friendly. They use a lot of local produce and ingredients from around the CSRA. They occasionally have food deals and they have some daily deal on food and/or drinks.Parking is usually just along the side streets and in the corner lot at night. You may have to walk a bit if you can't find anything close and have to park along Broad. I love the atmosphere here and the decor is 'hive' themed. It's subtle but you definitely can notice it. I sure miss this place as it was my go to place for beer before I moved away.If you haven't given it a try, the Hive is a wonderful that I know will continue to provide Augusta with great beer."}, {"review_id": "RPffOmvjTWn27YJltnRL6w", "user_id": "tvn6_ztq_zRxb0blOOogxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "This place is all about the beers.

The mustard served with it was good, too. I may build a grilled cheese and get tomato soup next time.

And once you've learned that the same people who run it opened and run The Hive, you know it's going to be good. Plus, it's a growler bar like none other in Augusta. With 78 taps (which you can monitor the levels of in real time) and a full bar, you will return. You can order a flight, a glass, a howler (half growler), a carafe, whatever your heart's desire.     Any of the \"Greens\" or \"Small(er) Plates\" are a good start. I favor the poutine myself. Then you migrate to the real deal; burgers, poboys, grilled cheese (for grown ups), fish and chips, and more! If somehow you have room for dessert, reward yourself.

Old building from the outside and ultra modern inside. They apparently don't seem to have a parking lot, seems to be plenty of street parking nearby. We went on a Saturday early evening. We sat at the bar because we were not certain that we were going to eat there or not. They have 60+ beers on tap and a few wines on tap as well. (and canned mixed drinks? we did not understand what these were) The beer and wine list is on a iPad or tablet because it changes so often. I had a Malbec red wine, a short pour for tap wine, and my friend had a beer that the bartender recommended. After a couple of glasses of wine we decided to eat there. We started with their version of boiled peanuts, made with a Cajun spice, a small bowl for 5 dollars. These were a disappointment to us both. The Cajun spice added nothing and we have had much better and fresher boiled peanuts from a convenient store. For dinner I had a Grilled Cheese with sharp cheddar, arugula, tomato, and avocado, served with a side of garlic fries. (9 bucks) My friend had the Cesar Salad (6 dollars). You can pick your cheese and ingredients from a list. My Grilled Cheese was fine, about what I expected. The fries were overcooked and a little burnt. But we ate a few anyway and left the rest. The Cesar Salad was the best of the night.Service was fast and friendly, and you need it to navigate the beer list.  If you want beer this is your kind of place, I guess. The food is so so. Might come back when I'm in the mood for beer."}, {"review_id": "9QQXTkidxnlDL4YiCdhAKA", "user_id": "Wjlo5YcDe2Lc7I4WNqooDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "There are few beer venues that are truly awe-inspiring and the Hive is one of them!

What I imagined was a cut sandwich dropping with a generous portion of cheese like I might make at home.  The apple I added on it was okay though also a meager portion.  The outside looked grilled brown but the contents were simply disappointing.I added sweet potato fries to my meal but 2/3rds of them were almost blackened and I found them inedible.I am giving the restaurant 3 stars as a point of saying as a pub serving drinks it is great.  The staff were professional and attentive and the ambiance refreshing but if you are hungry... buyer beware.  I fear you will be sadly disappointed.   Maybe the chef was just having a bad day.  Maybe not."}, {"review_id": "EVZJu_V1id1Br1LrdCkTPA", "user_id": "69i_x9Zls7riywo9JUH2zA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/26/2017", "text": "Very nice ambiance reminiscent of a hipster bar.

I wanted to crush the competition for this place because it was so amazing. I was also surprised to see other reviews with 3 stars but they showed pics that did seem to justify the review...off day? I had a hugely different experience. Zack was a badass with his beer knowledge. I had 5 great beers (flights! I'm not a drunk damn you!) ranging from not my type to just right but even the not my types were of great quality and had some info of the origin.I had the sweet sausage and wings. Perfect pairings for beers!! The sweet sausage was a very sweet and sour cut to the bitter of an IPA so they just worked perfectly!! I'm not a connoisseur by any means but even I know that the sweet sausage compliments the beer. The wings were as good as I wanted them to be but the surprise came from from the ranch. They make their own ranch?? I don't know but it was good.Below is a picture of the sweet sausage that will hopefully make the other guy's bad grilled cheese experience seem like whoever made it was thrown off a cliff!
