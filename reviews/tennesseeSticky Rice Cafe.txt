My wife and I generally share entrees and this place is perfect for that. We both had the spring rolls which were wrapped in rice paper.  We elected to have it with the barbecue pork.  The rolls came with a delicious spicy peanut sauce.  Also on the side was a special hot sauce that was really hot.  The ingredients were fresh.  The spring rolls were excellent.For my entree I ordered the phorrito which was basically beef wrapped in a grilled tortilla roll with rice and bean sprouts and spices and a beef broth.  This was really good and I spiced it up with a gooey barbecue style sauce on the side.My wife ordered the Crispy rice with pork. This dish was really different than anything else I have ever tried.  A really beautiful dish that was spicy but not overwhelming.  Sauces on the side can spice to any desire heat. Laos sits landlocked between Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.  The food is unlike anything I have tried before.  The restaurant feels authentic with a Laotian family serving the meals.  Well run and very clean. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to try a different spin on Chinese or Thai food."}, {"review_id": "jT_vmwvQ_vh78y0677KL1w", "user_id": "Nl5mbLq9XT9tCfgIfGjVwA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "I love family owned restaurants.

The restaurant was busy but food came out quick. There was a good turn of patrons so we didn't have to wait but a few minutes. The staff was friendly, food came out quick and was of high quality.  One of my new favorite places that I will have to eat each time I come to the city. Orderd the whole fried quail. It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Great flavor. Also had the Kow Poon small. It was anything but small. Creamy, spicy, lots of noodles and a generous portion.  Great dish.Ad a Beer Lao and it was an excellent experience."}, {"review_id": "-rSMQmrN2tNeN2lhUoD0fg", "user_id": "4XK5D4yO9PaMrphK3b98MQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "The food was real fresh.

Our waitress was very nice and helped us choose great dishes. She wasn't lying when she said their spicy is SPICY. I got the soup with the coconut with shrimp (Kow Phoon) i think. It was sooo spicy I could barely get a good taste of it. But it wasn't bad. The fried egg rolls were good -- we got the pork and chicken rolls and both were good. I loved the sticky rice with mango too.

They definitely brand themselves as a trendy little cafe. It had a modern vibe and the place was pretty clean. The food was delicious. My SO ordered the pork chop (marinated deliciously and oh so moist...I usually hate saying this word but it is deservingly used here), the broth that came with it was intensely flavorful as well. My beef laarb was exploding with rich flavors and there was more than enough in the lunch portion. The beef was also pretty tender! Both of our dishes came with cute little woven baskets with sticky rice. I definitely overate. But it was so worth it. Don't overlook this place! In a city that lacks ethnic food variety, I'm hopeful that restaurants like this will change that!"}, {"review_id": "ArtMKsBqDOJdh3AsPmDhhA", "user_id": "ocEjO9ayv0NJWd7Y42pD1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "What a hidden gem this is!!  Based on a recommendation from a family member, I went for a weekday lunch last week.  BUSY is the only word I can use to describe this place at lunch hour.  Watching the staff hustle while seated at the bar was nothing short of impressive.  It's a smaller space with, I'm assuming, a smaller kitchen and staff so do be prepared to potentially wait a bit, but know it's worth it!  My uncle with whom I was dining had the phoritto and enjoyed it.  I ordered the vegetable stir fry with tofu and steamed rice.  It was fresh and came dressed in a tasty light sauce that I enjoyed.  Also came with the most amazing soup broth with chopped green onion and garlic - I don't do soup much, but I couldn't put my spoon down here!  I also tried a lychee bubble/boba tea and it was quite good as well.  I'm so glad we tried this place, as I will definitely be back!!"}, {"review_id": "MlZrLwozApqEHXvotmuslw", "user_id": "AZwB-4EujSPN94Bwx6XarA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/25/2017", "text": "What am I supposed to do Sticky Rice Cafe?!  You have friendly service.  You serve boba tea.  Your prices are reasonable.  But that wasn't enough for you, was it?!  No.  You had to go and slap the Pho-ritto on menu.  You leave me no choice but to fall head over heals in love.  Seriously, you guys!  This little family run spot has some of the best food in Knoxville.  The servers are great!  They are happy to help you find something you'll love on their menu.  Vegetarian?  No worries.  They've got you covered too!I ordered the Pho-ritto and was blown away.  I didn't expect it to have so much flavor, but it was freaking delicious!  It's crammed full of all the delicious goodness you'd find in the soup, but wrapped in a tortilla and grilled.

I started off with 2 fresh spring rolls with shrimp and the peanut butter dipping sauce for an appetizer.  I also decided on the infamous Phoritto for lunch.  The spring rolls were ok, not much flavor and the 1st time I have ever had ones with lettuce in it.  The peanut sauce was also kind of bland so I added some siracha and chili sauce and it was much better.  Then Phoritto was amazing, it has siracha in it as well (they let you know prior to ordering so I'm guessing you can do it without if you don't like heat).  The Pho broth was delicious and full of flavor that paired perfectly with the Phoritto. Overall I was impressed and look forward to going back to try more."}, {"review_id": "l2SG00mce9275MXmcS9bIA", "user_id": "qUKE0nnHWqPONoTYamb9mw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Okay Delicious and Fresh!!

I'm originally from the Philippines and I also love to travel around the neighboring Asian countries such as Laos, Singapore, Hongkong, Vietnam, Thailand Etc., and I'm also a big foodie. I tried this place for the first time. The sticky rice instead of regular jasmine rice was different for me, being we use the sticky rice as a desert in my home country, but don't get me wrong, I can literally eat sticky rice all day. Lol! My favorite \"Khao poon\" is the Laotian version of laksa and definitely they made it AMAZING here! So much so that my husband, that usually is a fan of pho, changed his favorite soup. I love the spicy and sour flavor of the curry. Its delicious!

I'm starting to notice a strip mall epidemic here, West Knoxville (but I am visiting my sister for the holidays and a victim of her suburban circumstance). We're Thai, neighbors to Laos, so the favors are different enough to be interesting, and familiar enough to be comforting. Had the fried crispy chicken skins, which were a delicious guilty pleasure and paired with a spicy sour dipping sauce. The crispy rice with sour pork sausage was all of the amazing flavorful bits of pan crunchified rice (which is beloved by so many cultures: called \"socarrat\" in Spain & \"khao taen\" in Thailand) and appreciated by all at the table. Little woven baskets housed steamed sticky rice as an adjunct to all the dishes (beware gluten-free peeps bc this rice is called glutinous rice for a reason!). Because moderation knows my family not during the holidays, we also ordered spring rolls, crispy chicken wings with Lao rub (crispy bread-free fried perfection), kow poon (curry, coconut, bamboo & shredded chicken with vermicelli noodles, and seafood laab. It was a ton of food for 4 people, but we happily packed up leftovers. Solid choice, nice to see something a little different amongst the chain restaurants out here in the 'burbs. Decor was super basic and just pretty functional, but service was good and though we walked in to several empty tables at around 6 on a Monday, within30 minutes, the place was packed, so I see the locals are appreciating this gem as well."}, {"review_id": "WQAJQAgZdU-oKh-sDoV7xA", "user_id": "6NvurzfJ85LzzOO2Uj-4tw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Love this place.

The same can't be said for regulars though, they get special treatment and that's rightfully so of course. Food is legit! I grew up with tons of Laotian friends and my sister married into a Lao family so I've been fortunate to have eaten lots.... and I mean LOTS of Lao food (yes, I know it's Laotian food..  but us Asians just call it Lao food haha). It's very good here. Legit good. Not legit homestyle. Because legit homestyle wouldn't be for everyone.  I've had a variety of their dishes and I can recommend all except their Pho. Their Pho is good don't get me wrong, it's just not a true Vietnamese Pho and I'm Vietnamese so I'm picky about that."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sticky-rice-cafe-knoxville?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
