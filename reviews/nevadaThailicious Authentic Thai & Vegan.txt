We had papaya salad, drunken noodles, and crispy duck Panang curry. We ordered all the dishes at 4 spicy, and it wasn't unbearably spicy, the noodles were t very spicy and that helped break up the heat a little bit. Service was a little slow, we sat for about 10 minutes before we placed orders. And it was kind of the same when we finished and wanted the bill. Definitely the some of the best Thai food I've had in Henderson."}, {"review_id": "YdU2IR5QwS3Uy2JUN48l7A", "user_id": "QcckMs29Z47tuSyWDCMUlA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I was really excited for this place to open up, as I had been a fan of Komol for years.The first time I came here the service was really bad, a few of the staff didn't speak very good English and they were confused on basic requests of mine like asking for a glass of water. English is my second language as well, so I am certainly not faulting anyone for not speaking the language. But if your job is to take food orders, I do think it is pretty important that you understand the language. Ordering was very difficult. Food came out warm not hot, and the taste was mediocre.Second time I came here the service was much better, the food was still just mediocre at best. I know it's the same recipes as the older's uncle's restaurant but for some reason I liked the other place much better. Maybe this place is just too trendy for me and not warm or inviting enough. I guess it just doesn't feel that comfortable inside, maybe it's the seats, maybe it's the vibe itself. I just know what I have been to plenty of amazing Thai restaurant over the years and had a great meal. Both times that I've dined here I have not felt that way. The environment feels kind of sterile. And with the food just being mediocre at the pricing not being particularly great or different than any other Thai restaurant, I see no reason why I would choose to come here over any other place. Sorry, thailicious, you just haven't won me or my family over."}, {"review_id": "CvEmILFelZnGdoZDEEMzrg", "user_id": "TZbDVP_OUXJ8YWQuqOYZqw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "A surprisingly excellent Thai restaurant in Henderson Nevada.

Their lunch specials, being only $6.99, are such good deals. Most thai restaurants in town charge $9-10 for lunch specials nowadays. You get a soup or salad and an egg roll with your lunch special.

When initially ordering, the lady asked what spice level I wanted.  I told her 7 but she looked at me like I was crazy.  She thought putting the spice on the side so we could add what we wanted was a better option.  Now this has happened at other Thai restaurants so you'd think I would be used to it.  I certainly spiced it up at home with the small container they included. Nonetheless, I would order this dish again!There were a few little snafus but that won't stop me from coming back."}, {"review_id": "i1g5fjs1DMBTgJSaf2TfUg", "user_id": "ed-C-BTs9Xp_5pqo32bLAw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Location: Right in the middle of Henderson in one of the many strip malls  which line all of the main roads.

I would describe this as modern Thai with some other complimentary asian dishes. It has less focus on classic authentic Thai specialities. We had the Massaman Tofu Curry, Roti Bread, crispy eggplant, beef and meatball noodle soup (pho like soup and noodles). They were all good but we just touched the surface of the menu.

Although it's a significant drive across the valley for me, I made the trek to have lunch with a friend for their vegan specialities. The entire menu is expansive, but the lunch menu is a good sampling of what they offer. The pricing, portion, and speed of service allow you to pop in here for a quick working lunch on a weekday, too.I had to start with the fried spinach appetizer- a similar dish is served at another great spot in town, but priced nearly twice as high. I found Thailicious' version to be comparable in both portion size and quality. That dressing they use is great! The vegan pad thai, available with either fried or sauteed tofu, was a large portion packed with noodles and veggies. The starter soup and spring roll were well-made and flavorful, too. I sampled my friend's beef pad thai and the meat was tender and well-prepared. I'm looking forward to my next work trip across town so I can order the vegan khao soi next time!"}, {"review_id": "UfcWNFEyhZZsWs01fpZbKA", "user_id": "yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Great spot for fresh Thai food in the Henderson area. I have had the pad se ew noodle dish, panang curry, and chicken pad Thai. All have been non-greasy and seasoned well. If you don't like things spicy, you can request the spice level to be zero. The Butterfly Pea Lemongrass Drink is my favorite here. It has a hint of lemongrass and comes in blue, but when you squeeze the lemon in and mix it, it turns purple! I have not dined inside, but have mostly gone in for pick ups for to go orders. With its growing popularity, dinner time can get busy, but you can always call ahead for pick up. The restaurant is very clean and well decorated as well. There is a T.V. on usually playing sports which I like. There is a mixed lot of people from families to couples dining in, so the place is great for a variety of occasions. There is also a section in the menu that is vegan friendly.

Chicken curry was just delicious and perf! The pad Thai was good as well, but I'm just not a pad thai kinda girl.I low-key almost got annoyed because me and my friends were going to be late for class. We've asked for our mango with sticky rice since mid-feasting on our meal, just so we knew it was going to come out at a safe time for us. Still, even after we were all done, the mango with sticky rice took so looong. Yes we were late for class, but you guys..... the Mango with sticky rice here was well worth it!!!Presentation was fantastic. I don't know how or why the sticky rice was bluish/greyish tinged, but the taste was just way above delicious. Mango with sticky rice is one of those Thai dishes that taste the same everywhere, but Thailicious' version will forever stand out to me.

This is easily my new favorite Thai restaurant! Food: Fist off they also have a full vegan menu which is amazing! Now I can get bomb Thai food and invite my vegan friends too! We ordered the yellow curry with shrimp and the tom yum soup with shrimp. The yellow curry was delicious, I've had yellow curry many times all over and this is in the top 3! The consistency, the flavor, the big chunks of potatoes and carrots, just everything is perfect. The Tom yum soup was also amazing, it had so much flavor and was the perfect weapon to combat an oncoming cold. We ordered it spicy but even though we were dying we couldn't stop eating haha it was so good! Last we ordered the mango and sticky rice. Just wow. Not many places know how to make the sticky rice like this place and the fact that they bring it out on a wooden with a beautiful flower just made it that much better. Experience: So good! Funny story, one of use accidentally spilled our soup all over ourselves and the staff ran to grab napkins and towels to help clean us up but first asking if we were ok! They even offered to replace our bowl of soup. Exceptional customer service for sure! They kept an eye on us and kept our drinks refilled at all times. The owner came and talked to us after our meal and told us a little more about the restaurant which was so sweet. Location: It's in the shopping center right next to the freeway and easy to find. It's a decent sized restaurant with about 10 tables if I remember correctly. Everything is nice and clean and new. Come check them out!

I enjoyed having the option to spice it up on my own. The sauce for the fish was sweet but good. But I enjoyed the customer service even more then the food. Everyone was awesome. There was not one employee who walked by me and didn't ask how I was doing or if my food was ok. It's not easy to find good customer service and authentic food in one location in Las Vegas.

My faves the Crispy Eggplant, Crispy Spinach, the Tom Kha Veggie Soup, Paradise Salad. Just love how the flavors pop out on all their dishes. Five stars for having an awesome, delicious and affordable 6.99 special during the lunch hours. Good variety of entrees offered and generous portions. Word of mouth has spread fast and it's super busy during these times but quick turnaround, and haven't had to wait to be seated.Inviting ambiance. Natural lighting. Spacious dining area has clean modern look. It's primarily table service style restaurant, so wait to be seated and pay at end of your meal. Service is great now! In the beginning they were overwhelmed, slow and orders were forgotten, but forgivable, being it was during the first week, but the staff has been very welcoming, efficient, and always smiling.

We loved both and a spice level 5 was solid spicy right where we enjoyed it.
