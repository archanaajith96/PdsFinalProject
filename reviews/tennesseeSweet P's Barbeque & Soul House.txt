My wife and I are from Austin TX so we know and love good barbecue. We decided to order the sampler plate with 2 drinks which ran 33.00, not cheap.The sweet tea was definitely sweet I had to add some unsweet so I could drink it. The pulled pork was over cooked and dry, the brisket was also very dry. The ribs were better than the latter. Our sides were greens, mac & cheese and  pinto beans. The greens were the blandest I have ever had, the mac & cheese was adequate and the pinto beans were good but looked more like refried beans. All in all I dont think we will be returning. Oh and by the way if you need to use the bathroom hold it and go somewhere else,YUK."}, {"review_id": "lMYwLOg6cjo7enNeGl7Swg", "user_id": "5MYFc_57Ioh5SRBt0PCl7g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "This place was out of this word.

This place has delicious pulled pork and fall of the bone ribs with the Mac and cheese.  However the gumbo tasted over seasoned and the potato smashed needed a little flavor. I'd definitely go back to try more off the menu.  Overall a great experience with a very helpfully staff and laid back atmosphere.  Make sure to check in before you order.

We ordered the brisket, ribs, tater salad, and mac n cheese. Let me say that the meats are very well cooked. However, the taste didn't do it for me. The brisket was quite sweet and the ribs just generally lacked flavor. Still, the brisket was very juicy and tender, while the ribs were perfectly charred on the outside and moist on the inside. For me, the sides were really the stars of the meal. It was an overall tasty meal, but nowhere near the best BBQ I've had."}, {"review_id": "ICdJdM_0vEsIj2ypxPLC0g", "user_id": "tFq9NDagDRQ-xfFUbBAcwg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/22/2016", "text": "First BBQ is my passion. I'm a KCBS Certified BBQ Judge, so I take it serious (maybe a little too serious).  This was my first trip based on a recommendation from a neighbor.  When we arrived there was already a line forming but there were plenty of tables.  As you walk up, a person takes your order.  There wasn't much mixing and matching.  This was my first time and wanted to try the sample plate.  It was a choice of 3, pork, chicken, ribs or brisket.  I asked if I get sausage instead of pork or chicken.  The server said No we only sale sausage on Friday.  I looked at him and said today is Friday.  Lol oh but you can only get the sausage plate or sample plate. Well ok then.  It gets better.  Brisket comes in two parts, the point (commonly referred to as the moist) and the flat (the lean).  I told the guy I wanted Moist and he looked at me funny.  I said brisket usually comes moist or lean. He said its all mixed up so I would prefer moist.  Got all lean. Honestly I don't think he really knew there's a difference. As for the brisket, it was tender but virtually no flavor.  Honestly, I wish I would have ordered something else.  The sides were fine.  I gave my son the Mac and cheese and he said was really good.  The banana pudding was fine. My son got the ribs.  They were actually pretty good.  They were tender with decent flavor.  They're dry ribs but really needed some sauce to make it, which is a knock IMO.  However, I can recommend the ribs.  Overall, I'm really on the fence. The brisket wasn't a complete disappointment because of the tenderness but lacked flavor.  I can recommend the ribs. We had very little interaction with staff.  I will come back for another try."}, {"review_id": "xNUPofdKs3NdrQeY4dXHlA", "user_id": "OofmqBk0Dwu653Z9xMfFvA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/22/2017", "text": "This place is known as Sweet P's but the extended name really captures the essence.

They Have the outdoor seating as well as cozy indoor bar, and the place is near boat harbor, must be a very busy place in summer as boats going out.A long line here when I came in about 12:30 p. Looked a few previous reviews, decide to go with half rack BBQ ribs, also choose the pimento cheese dips. Ribs are awesome! I can't believe the size of the serving, these ribs are BIG and juicy. The brown sugar pepper topping paired deliciously with the smoky flavor. I really enjoy it even without any sauce. The size is so BIG I didn't even finish it and have to ask for a to-go box (only half rack!). Pimento cheese dips are also exceptionally good taste, the potato chips are rinse with brown sugar and pepper piece too. Everything is sweet with a little spicy kicking in, Sweet!Service and chef are very welcoming, and I will definitely come back next time in town."}, {"review_id": "UZ4-uYvjTw0pqlIxNkNsHA", "user_id": "allaDywVs23K0-nu3Nmy0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "We love Sweet Ps and are fortunate enough to live super close.
