Their peanut butter turtle pie is delicious. Love their craft drinks. Beet Margaritas FTW! Give their spicy mussels a try if u like a good spicy broth. Their in-house sausage absolutely shines in their pizzas! Only place in GR to have \"sex\" dry rosè on Tap. Come for the happy hour stay for dinner.  In all we have never had a disappointing meal at Terra. Staff is amazing as always.

As a Grand Rapids visitor, I will definitely be recommending Terra to others whenever they're in the area. The restaurant is located on a corner and is right around the corner from a cupcake shop (yum, again). The interior is beautiful - nice date night or family dinner location. We grabbed lunch on a Thursday and there were very few people in the restaurant. The place did start filling up as we were eating, though!I ordered the herbed chicken sandwich. I highly recommend this sandwich to anyone who likes chicken salad! The sweet cherries and the herbs on the chicken make for a sweet and savory combination. The bread is soft and pairs quite nicely with the chicken and lettuce. I subbed in the pesto pasta salad ($3 extra) and it was sooo worth it. It was fresh and flavorful.I loved my experience here - service was attentive, food was amazing, and ambience was beautiful. If you're looking for a nice meal, look no further than Terra!"}, {"review_id": "ZBnNKZ9UGoND1X_VCBOFbA", "user_id": "y8jJV4AeH6ZEBagQ_ys8KQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Great, spacious ambiance and delicious pasta! I started off with their kale caesar which was really good, a simple salad with a good dressing and good cheese.

The venue is stunning and has a beautiful decor. The area it's located has many different restaurant but this definitely stands out.For appetizers, we had the trout spread. It was delicious. The spread had a lot of different flavors and the trout was very pronounced. The bread was a little bit crunch to the preference but was toasted perfectly. Entrees I had the mussels and the girlfriend had the mac and cheese. We both enjoyed our meals and my mussels were somewhat overdone but the tomato sauce, which was great, helped bring down the toughness of the mussel.The wine and beer selection is very huge and I just had an Oberon for dinner. The service was okay, we ran out of water a few times before getting refilled but our waitress was helpful letting us know what was favorites on the menu."}, {"review_id": "kbxB2yQnwtJHNewT9i0ZoQ", "user_id": "QMv3G0xwD4u4me0_nWXTng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Terra GR has 2 things I love - an awesome happy hour and a delicious breakfast pizza. The happy hour offers deals on most of their drinks and discounts on certain appetizers, salads and pizzas. All of the pizzas are delicious! If you're looking for a good brunch menu on the weekends, you have to try the breakfast pizza! I recommend adding the fennel sausage to the pizza as well. Terra GR also offers free custom printer menus for special occasions - just make sure you mention it when you call for your reservation!"}, {"review_id": "57wpi-O8Arbwh5Xi_d5tIQ", "user_id": "8CERYXhmm5qTLDbLir20Qg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Love this place.

Terra could do no wrong in the kitchen or with the service that day. Everything was truly solid all around and we will be back because we want more! To start, we ordered a dish that was slated to be an entrée. It sounded so good when the waiter described it that we had to have it as an appetizer. It was a generous portion of grits that were smooth and silky but still had the grit texture, layered with some delicious fall off the bone roasted meat and a sauce that just screamed wow! We were starting off right. As Terra is a farm to table concept and my review is a week old in writing I'm not sure the name of the dish but it was one of those dishes you either made it in for or you missed it. Now we move onto the dinner entrees. Our table had the duck! So tender, so much flavor through the entire dish. We also had two pasta dishes and those were both outstanding. Definitely a nice touch that the pasta was made in house. With my pasta dish I ordered a side of the salmon filet. This chunk of salmon was cooked to perfection. Crisp and again much flavor but tender and juicy as all get out when cutting open and consuming! So far the Terra, you have done no wrong. So good! When dining at a place like this you need to indulge so we did by jumping all over head first into dessert. Now the desserts here aren't typical as in when they say pie its pie like but that really doesn't matter. It's all about the flavors. We had the blueberry compote, windmill cookie crust and cream cheese filling cheesecake. It was truly a delight to the taste buds. Also had a peanut butter fudge gooey thing a ma jig that was to die for to. Both desserts played well to share as it was a battle between sweet and slightly savory.As I said at the start Terra was a spectacular dining experience and when back in GR we will be back to indulge in more. So yes please we do have so much more to try! Keep up the good work! You're a one of a kind spot in Grand Rapids, Michigan!"}, {"review_id": "JxTIm44Xjy3DRD_IYI_dfg", "user_id": "-O9p1X9QDNOKYlKw-7Vkuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "My brother invited me to have brunch today and I haven't done brunch in years.  When I googled \"brunch places in Grand Rapids\"  apparently there are quite a few restaurants offering brunch. Who knew?  After looking at a few menus online, we picked Terra GR. The menu has a wide variety...and who can turn down a Bloody Mary?  I'm vegan for all of January, so having some options was important. They are all farm to table, source everything locally and have vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. I had the Tofu Scramble which was really delicious!  The pesto absolutely makes it really flavorful. My brother ordered the Pork Belly Hash which he enjoyed thoroughly. The Bloody Mary was good, albeit pretty standard. They make their own mix, but there wasn't anything out of the ordinary in it...at least that I could tell. But good nonetheless. The atmosphere was fantastic. Warm and inviting. We were there right when they opened at 10 am, and by 10:15 am the place was full.  They do take reservations, which might not be a bad idea. Our server Anneke was a delight and stopped regularly to check on us and refill our water bottle. You could tell she loves her job!  All in all, a great experience and we'll definitely be back to explore more of the menu!"}, {"review_id": "xg3fJPu7itXCR-SDPhmsQA", "user_id": "SZ9Jyi58ANG6ZzPwW9S3Dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2017", "text": "This review is for Terra's brunch! I went at about 1pm on a Sunday and there was no wait which was great. Parking can be a tiny bit tricky but on a Sunday I parked in the post office like most others and it was fine. I got a table with 2 friends right next to their kitchen which was pretty open and it was cool to see them cooking!Their breakfast pizza looked amazing, with hot hollandaise sauce poured on top, and it tasted even better! The perfect breakfast pizza perhaps.Their caramel apple cinnamon roll had little candied peanuts and little pieces of apple inside and it was perfect... and their mashed potato cakes were delicious as well! We loved everything we tried! I'll definitely be back, and I've sent friends there already who also loved their experience!"}, {"review_id": "k1-gULEi29LBaBC599uK3w", "user_id": "7RVtCnATI5EZbx0O_9EiqA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2017", "text": "Absolutely loved this place! One of the best brunches I've had. Great food, attentive service, and lovely atmosphere. There wasn't one thing I didn't like about Terra.Really nice space with lots of natural lighting, high ceilings, wood accents - a mix of modern and industrial. Our waitress had a great knack for making sure our water/coffee was always full and checking up on us once or twice, but not being too bothersome or over-checking on us.I had the pork belly hash with poached eggs which was to die for. There was a healthy portion of thick-cut pork belly which was crispy but also lightly coated in maple syrup which made for a luscious taste. The seasonal root vegetables were perfectly cooked, and the cheese blend was just a light sprinkle which was great and didn't overpower the dish. My mom and sister had the hair of the dog bowl (essentially biscuits and gravy in a bowl) and the fritatta which were both delicious as well. Bonus points for a very well-labeled menu! Love when they indicate which dishes are gluten free, dairy free, etc. They have lots of options for vegan, vegetarians, and dairy/gluten free eaters. They also use pastured meats, cage free eggs, and local/seasonal produce and products which is awesome. I'm always willing to pay a little extra for great ingredients.Already looking forward to my next visit!"}, {"review_id": "OEr8Unc7pCBdZulVTMu2Zw", "user_id": "BR6nfpcLsd77MMUZMEuAnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "Today on Nos and Savage's Food Ravage, all of our cousins came in from around U.S. to join us for a special edition of the review. We went to Terra GR, a spaciously artistic style restaurant with great food and amazing service. I would highly recommend if you have more than 4 guests, making a reservation ahead of time. They will call you the day prior to confirm. Presentation was a plus, with minimalist style choices, making the food be the main attraction. The kitchen is open and complements a wood fired oven for pizza and other such food items.We were there during brunch, so I got the quinoa wrap with a side of biscuits and gravy. Savage decided to go for a ham and cheddar omelette. Both had amazing presentation and flavor. The quinoa wrap was incredibly tasty with the apples and maple-dijon complementing the savory potatoes into a sweet delight for anyone to try. Savage thought that the omelette he had was possibly one of the best he ever tried. The biscuits and gravy were the personal highlight of the meal. Natural sausage with the gravy made from the same drippings with not a pinch of salt extra needed. The biscuits were not premade, but house made drop style biscuits. The crunchiness of the biscuit mixed with the amazing sausage gravy was simply divine.We had two servers, Lede and Christina, since we had such a large group and they were absolutely lovely to talk with and converse with about the food and other items of interest. The management was even nice enough to customize our menus so we could remember this moment for later years. Amazing experience and would highly recommend for all ages and occasions. Nos and Savage give Terra GR an astounding 5 out of 5. Great job."}, {"review_id": "AzixpXLCKFn7bvf0zAJWJw", "user_id": "HYVESLDUtjgFP6uY6o1Nrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Five stars? More like five HUNDRED stars!!
