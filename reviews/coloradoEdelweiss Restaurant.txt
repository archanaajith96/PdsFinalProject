Even just the salads are fancy and delicious!At the time that we went, they were SUPER slammed, so I don't hold it against them that it took almost an hour to get our food. What I didn't care for was that after waiting a loooong time, they accidentally brought us someone else's food and didn't realize it until one of the ladies in our group was already eating. They took the plates away and didn't get us OUR food for another 20 minutes after that. The one chick had already finished eating when our food arrived."}, {"review_id": "D4jKqhzljqc2Gg3xPLp6nw", "user_id": "HIhPuKWV_r05-4w57nGFnQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Authentic from the appearance of the restaurant to the items on the menu.I travel frequently and was in Germany a few months ago.  I was pleased to find the food was reminiscent of my recent trip.It's hard to find a good sauerbraten, however, Edelweiss did a fantastic job."}, {"review_id": "k0_tuyGMInktKI3SVkjFJw", "user_id": "6x4zsQC5_IjGi4X5hQQhcA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "Wow!!! Brought me right back to my childhood! The spatzle was spot on! Perfectly made, not gummy or chewy and not covered by too much sauce. Just perfect! If you stop in get the Badische Platte and the Edelweiss Platte. Between the two it's a sampling of all the entries on the menu and they're both FANTASTIC!!Each main had an accompaniment and they were perfectly paired. Even the Goulash they I didn't think I'd like. However, if you're looking for a stand alone amazing item the Veal Weinerschnitzel is terrific! A table adjacent to us ordered the Bayrische Schweinshaxe which is a 22oz bone in beer marinated ham shank. It looked a lot bigger than 22oz and the patron said it was to die for. If you find yourself in Colorado Springs stop in and don't forget the dessert!!"}, {"review_id": "LjAtBFbdGJOZKyUcGPxNbQ", "user_id": "CicdT9j8JIpa1FjcMqYONg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Rustic Bavarian restaurant with a good selection of German Beers available, many on tap.  In some respects, the décor will evoke memories of Germany.  Large dining room is great for large groups or others who just want a good meal at a decent price in a casual setting.  Schnitzel specialties, made the way you prefer.  Mine had a lot more thick, pasty, brown gravy than I prefer. Fried potatoes were flavorful, but a bit cool - not warm. The accompanying vegetables were mushy  soft, from being overcooked or sitting too long - basically flavorless.   Desserts are typical German style cakes and pastries.    Service was spotty at best.  The place is popular, for reasons I don't understand."}, {"review_id": "sLXq7Rfw_5TsKIoFtK1kgQ", "user_id": "lSrmZ5TZm9ltJzSgQ9OQBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Wonderful food and fun atmosphere.

The best is at Christmas when it's extra special with the holiday atmosphere and traditional desserts. I'm not sure the accordion band plays all the time or just seasonally, but it's a lot of fun. The food is legit and consistent; you're not going to find a ton of young people having cocktails lol but it's a nice, energetic, fun family place. Great for entertaining guests that like a good meal and a good laugh. Now I need to go again soon! We love the jagerscnitzel the best.

However, the main dishes were pretty tasteless. The salad was a collection of traditional German potato salad, pickled beets, etc. and was quite delicious. The potato pancake appetizer with smoked salmon and trout was equally good. The Wiener schnitzel was unbelievably bland. The pork was tough and there was no seasoning. All the lemon in the world didn't help. Others dining with me commented similarly on their versions of pounded, breaded meat. The accompanying vegetables were cold and undercooked (they included huge chunks of spaghetti squash). It all seems very authentic but it just wasn't for me. Service was efficient. Desserts looked fabulous although we did not sample them."}, {"review_id": "W-1oiRKlF5U7Be66_jQYVw", "user_id": "tx2AUA4XCvELR_lt4TcwqA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "I thought my coworker was taking me somewhere shady at first.

It's the kind of meal you don't forget. The atmosphere is cute and quaint. We ate in the Biergarten. If I could have hung out there for a few hours, and drank a few beers, I would have.

They obviously have a good following because there were people seated in various rooms of the restaurant.  I ordered the hot spiced wine which was a bit sweet but very good. Highly recommended!  There's also a nice selection of beers. My husband ordered a pork sandwich with fries. The sandwich was very big and he said it was good. He usually brings some home but not this time. I got the Jagersnitzle with spaetzle and veggies. It was very good but the squash was not soft as I'm used to. The pork and gravy was very good as was the spaetzle.  The rolls served with dinner were not fresh so 4 stars instead of 5.  The rolls were the only downside.

After finding a perfect spot to park our panzer, we were originally greeted quite poorly by the host. He seemed almost like he was forced to be there and put off a terrible vibe.Our waitress arrived at the table and my uncle made his usual jokes and the waitress was having none of it. Again, she seemed as if she was forced to be there. My uncle asked for a beer recommendation and the waitress shrugged it off, refusing to help. Overall, initially, quite a disappointing experience from the staff at the restaurant.I order the veil brats which were pretty solid, not fantastic, but solid. The price point is what was most disappointing about this place. $18 for a dinner which was not exactly enough food to justify the price.Everything changed when our waitress was switched out. Katelyn was fabulous, extremely bubbly, outgoing, friendly and humored my uncle's sometimes off color jokes. She stuck around 15 minutes past close and was a pleasure to chat with. She singlehandedly added 1 stars on the restaurant.Sadly a 2 star experience greatly improved by Katelyn.

Our waiter really hated his job and the cooks don't know ingredients in their sausages at all. After I was assured the ingredient I am allergic to was not in my food, I got am allergic reaction. Never even got an apology or was offered something else instead. I ended up switching food with another person at my table for something I could actually eat. Waiter acted like he could care less, even after I mentioned it twice. In addition we had dirty salad plates left from 1st course and dessert on our table at the same time and had to ask for iced tea refills multiple times over. Nobody seem to care about our experience here. I was very dissapointed that food allergy were not take seriously and that service was so poor.

Lovely German restaurant with lots of atmosphere. Love the outside dining on the patio with German music playing in the background and the birds singing. Service is very cheerful and attentive. The menu options are all wonderful, but I'm a schnitzel fan, and they don't disappoint. Most recently I had the Rahmschnitzel with spatzle and red cabbage. It was so delicious, and portions are huge. They also have a wonderful wine list and fabulous desserts, if you still have room for one, which sadly I did not. Edelweiss is always one of the highlights of my CO vacations. Not to be missed!!"}, {"review_id": "eJShpuyA7jAtZ272Ki0zig", "user_id": "96TQfoNOtJAQaNaIzplPyA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "We kept seeing the sign in 25 for this spot so I made reservations for a Saturday night. The only thing available was 845pm or 9pm. We took the 845pm. I love the look and feel of the restaurant. Very old world and lovely. We saw the \"wait to be seated\" sign so we waited and waited. No one ever came to the stand in 6-7 minutes. That's a lot of time when you are hungry and waiting and had a reservation. The place sounded busy and employees moved about, ignoring us. My husband finally flagged a woman walking out of the kitchen and she seated us. The lower level and back dining rooms seemed lively but she sat us at a table for two next to the kitchen entrance. I didn't see the beautiful fireplace and rooms that the other reviews show. Our server said hello and introduced herself by saying she was new and apologized if she pronounces anything wrong. Poor thing seemed worn out but she was sweet. She did a good job explaining items on the menu although she was new. We've been to many German restaurants and bierhalls around the country and were amazed at the lack of sausages on this menu. We are really into sausages, red cabbages sauerkraut, mustards and dark German bread. The only sausage I saw was a veal bratwurst. We'd hoped for a sausage platter of some sort. I had never had schnitzel so I tried the rahmschnitzel and he tried a platter. I loved the cold salad with the lettuce, beets, tomato, green bean salad and German potato salad. It was swimming in a vinaigrette though but I still liked it. The bread was disappointing because they were round white rolls, very hard and almost stale. Hard to break apart. I usually see brown breads served at German restaurants.  The schnitzel was good but I didn't like how thick the mushroom gravy was. I wished I'd gotten it plain. The spaetzle tasted and looked like Kraft Mac and cheese. I've never had it so not sure how to compare. The goulash on my husband's dish I'd never try again and the fried potatoes tasted frozen to me. I think we were both disappointed overall because we expected sausages and not heavy fried things and pasta and potatoes. Our fault for not looking at the menu first. Highlight of our dishes were the veggie medleys, cooked perfectly with still a bit of crunch and a hint of butter. Our server forgot my beverage until I was halfway through my meal. By then I didn't want it and I was glad she forgot and I told her it was OK. Overall the place didn't meet our expectations and the table next to the kitchen didn't help - I could see employees standing and chatting and some expletives. I think we'd go back for an appetizer (salads) and dessert and see if we could be seated someplace more lively and make reservations for earlier in the day."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/edelweiss-restaurant-colorado-springs?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
