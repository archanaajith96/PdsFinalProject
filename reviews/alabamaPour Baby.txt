I bookmarked, I came, I conquered, and I'll be back! Pour Baby is my new favorite in all of Mobile! The decor got me at first sight, the wine selection (they even have a great sweet red for lil' ol' me-- see pics), the relaxed but chic ambiance, and the food is great to boot... COUNT ME (all the way) IN! Ricky, our server and bartender, was a gracious host and offered amazing recommendations, tastes, and even introduced the hubs and I to the owner (he's a South Alabama supporter, yay)! Ricky was key to our epic first impression of Pour Baby. The food menu is well planned, with great (but not too many) options. The desserts are divine. The price point is great considering the quality, vibe, and service at Pour Baby! The hubs and I stopped in for small bites, wine, and dessert tonight, but we'll definitely be back to try some entrees! I was a Pour Baby fangirl at first sip! (I'm pretty sure I've found my Mobilian happy place y'all!) I can't give enough stars! Cheers!"}, {"review_id": "8GZ4dTlfyBFk9dxpVp3QDg", "user_id": "ejHGb18SLnpM6T8MzLsgQg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "Sometimes you just want to try it all, and at Pour Baby you can. Pick a few small plates and convince your friends to do the same and then feast away. I was lucky to sample the triple grilled cheese, beef tenderloin sliders, broiled oysters, cheese flight. At the end I needed an encore (I was on a trip after all), so I ended the experience with a generous piece of their buttermilk pie topped with bourbon cherries. Omg. Dreamy. Worthy of all accolades. Service was ok. Sometimes it seemed unnecessarily slow like with water refills and checks at the end. I'm glad we followed my local friend's recommendation and made the trek out there after the Mardi Gras Parade."}, {"review_id": "uRzfQlnXidqjqhe37CPA5w", "user_id": "91NZfQY0gzHWpOgQzbUV5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "I don't go to Mobile often but when I go again I will definitely make more dinner plans at Pour Baby.  Right of the bat the ambiance sets the tone for a great experience.  The attention to detail with the design is totally on point... make sure you scope out the artwork... definitely a conversation starter...  I went with a large group so i have a lot of pics attached.  Side note - every person at my table cleaned their plates and there were multiple discussions/debates over which plate tasted best... I still think mine won!!We started with the charcuterie board and a cheese board.  Highly recommended!  Our group was 8 totally and anything less than both boards would have caused some fork sword fights.  I then moved on to the chicken and grits... and it's by far the best chicken and grits i have ever had!  The grits were so creamy and buttery but not overwhelming.  The chicken was roasted and then - one of my fave parts- the skin was fried and stood up like a trophy in the middle of the dish.  The only thing that could have made this dish better would be a veggie on the side.... although i wouldn't have room for the entire dish if I had to make room for a veggie!Great atmosphere, great service and great company all made for an amazing Christmas dinner!"}, {"review_id": "Q0MRc9NHo8i1u0Ykzt5TQQ", "user_id": "2dBbeHiPBzPZa1X2Wk-EZg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Pour Baby is my favorite wine bar. My friends and I always go here for the Electra. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing and the staff is always super friendly. We like to sit in the corner and chat and unwind from the week.

The table's entrees included the tenderloin sliders, the shrimp scampi, the eggplant napoleon, the lobster pasta, the beef tenderloin, and the seafood macaroni and cheese. The food was very well prepared and everyone seemed to enjoy what they had chosen! The chef Weston,  came out to chat because he knew the chef in our party.  Honestly there were a few minor hiccups with the food and wine orders, one of the charcuterie plates came out at the very end of the meal she was nice enough to pack it up for them.  The tenderloin sliders were a little overcooked but again the chef re-fired them and they were fantastic.  The waitress seemed just a bit frazzled but she definitely did her best.  We enjoyed our meal but I don't know that I would drive back out there just to eat there."}, {"review_id": "HoTM8fCcOoOcTLmAL6FNdQ", "user_id": "nNmVfdufr2zCllAM5sHlfA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Love this place.

Great, little spot! Very classy and romantic atmosphere. The hubby and I were on a date night and it was well spent at Pour Baby. Got the seafood Mac, vegetable sides and cheese plate to go. Our waiter was very polite, knowledgeable and attentive. Really appreciate it the way they wrap up our cheese plate to go - it was like taking a gourmet picnic basket home. We devoured the three chefs cheeses, bread, crackers, jellyand grapes. It was delicious!! We will definitely be back on our next visit!"}, {"review_id": "fCZoLuhbWkHXYdq0doKpDA", "user_id": "AbqNZOLOFJKaRRJmuDBOAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Absolutely fabulous wine bar and restaurant.

Yes, please! It was my first visit, so I was excited to try it out. It was a really great atmosphere with an obviously very large selection of red and white wines, and handful of beers on draft. They also had a few signature cocktails and a full bar.  Our party consisted of a couple of avid Yelpers and a chef, so obviously we tried a little bit of everything there was to offer.  After everyone placed their wine orders, we started with 2 orders of the Chef's Charcuterie of Meats and an Artisanal Cheese Flight with a variety of 5 cheeses. We received one of the Charcuteries along with the cheese flight pretty soon, but unfortunately the second charcuterie came towards the end of the meal. Not sure what happened with that order, but the server packed it up for us and it was taken home. However, the charcuterie and the cheese flight I did try were both amazing! I would be lying if I said I remembered the exact 5 cheeses that were chosen, but I rarely meet a cheese I don't like.  Between everyone at the table, we tried the tenderloin sliders, the shrimp scampi, the pimento cheese, the lobster pasta, the eggplant napoleon, the beef tenderloin, the seafood mac, and the buttermilk pie and cheesecake for dessert. Everything I sampled was great! Weston, the chef, definitely does an amazing job. There were a few minor hiccups with the food and wine orders, but the servers and the kitchen went above and beyond to make it up to the table.  Would definitely try Pour Baby out again next time I'm in the WeMo area!"}, {"review_id": "5kl2q_nZ0LCcCUXwQdEdVg", "user_id": "na3-lKCPvIxW2Ge-z7UUbQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Wish they had food and bigger space.

We stopped by early afternoon on a Saturday and were pleasantly surprised to find a great wine selection, about six to eight beers on tap and a pretty good happy hour, ($2 off glasses of wine and 20% off bottles) even on a Saturday. The prices on wine were reasonable, you could easily find an enjoyable glass for under $10 (before the happy hour discount).The service was prompt, friendly and eager to help. The atmosphere is clean, chic and elegant, and best of all, smoke free!If you're in the area, and looking for a glass of wine or beer, definitely swing by. I did notice a selection of hard liquor, so I believe you had the option for liquor as well."}, {"review_id": "OYFjiEasAKULXRmmOzmAMA", "user_id": "KTmjl7Vt8vzsGQjCB9cnkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "The food was so good.
