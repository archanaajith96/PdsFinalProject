I came here on a weekend to study and found there are a lot of tables. More importantly free Wi-Fi AND outlet plug your computer in. Their coffee is roasted locally ( Counter Culture Coffee right here in Durham). I ordered the almond latte and was not disappointed!  Would definitely recommend to come here with a pair of headphones as it can get quite loud here. Be aware that parking is difficult over the weekend but I do think they have an underground lot where you can park. Would definitely come her often to study! Strongly recommend!Tl;dr: great coffee, free wifi, good for studying and catching up with someone here, parking could be a challenge."}, {"review_id": "rrEAdlVjuHTHCU1tmy003w", "user_id": "238qjOC5oSGYtv4UQ1N8bw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "My friend and I went here right before closing last night! I ordered a hot almond latte and my friend got one iced. Mine was phenomenal. I LOVED it. I could drink it alllll the time. I've actually never had a latte with latte art before. It was adorable! Just wish it wasn't so expensive! My friend got an iced one. The barista accidentally put 4 shots of espresso instead of the normal 2. He did say he'd remake hers but she didn't have him do that because it was so close to closing.I would definitely go back! They have a small amount of food so I'm interested in trying it out!"}, {"review_id": "aJjoxAJWoFgk3jKOP2REKA", "user_id": "cKubrbIMLWZr7LPaD_INlg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "It's hard not to love Jubala - I've been to this location a few more times than I'd like to admit! Much easier to park here than their downtown location so that's a huge plus.Jubala has all 3 key elements of a great food spot - quality/taste of the food, good service, and good interior design. Definitely a hipster/minimalist look, but their espresso is rich in taste and made to savor! Their iced lattes are nice too. I love places that make their own flavoring syrup, it truly makes a difference. Those biscuits are what dreams are made of. I always order mine with Pimento cheese which is SO freaking good, but I'm pretty sure they could put anything on one of their biscuits and I'd eat it! They can be pretty busy in the mornings so be prepared. My only small beef is that they only have one size of latte cup to go and it's a medium size. Sometimes you just need a big ass latte to get you through the day and a medium might not suffice."}, {"review_id": "hYdiu5M3VUeMWLQoZf0B3Q", "user_id": "BimzhdtDOP0fVdNNnBbpXQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Love the coffee, ambiance, etc.  1 complaint.Blows my mind that they open at 8:00 on the weekends.

It is a cafe with tasty lattes and a better than average food menu to say the least. The baristas definitely know what they are doing. I have been to my fair share of cafes in Raleigh and have been disappointed until I fell upon this one. I easily travel past 13 cafes to get to this one, so that is saying something.I have visited 4 times now, ordering items 'for here' and 'to go' and there are 2 things that always seem to bug me, which is why I can't give 5 stars. 1) they don't offer maple syrup for their waffles. Granted, these waffles are darn good and sweet, but they can be dry. I think offering the option of syrup would be a major plus for this place. 2) The baristas are constantly screaming out names of orders. If someone is going to be drinking at the cafe, I would suggest the cashier remember the face with the name and bring the drink to the customer's table. I did see them walking items to people, but it was after screaming their name multiple times. If this is offered, I guarantee more tips will be given to the employees. The constant name screaming is a big distraction.I love Jubala and will continue to be a customer regardless. I do hope, however, that they consider the suggestions of their customers."}, {"review_id": "Z9418OVLpjVD3Kd78wPywQ", "user_id": "s_wQDqZ6jWu67WtOUCZrww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "As far a as a cappuccino goes, this was the best I've had in a while.  The ratio of espresso and milk were perfect.  I was happy to see that they use local counter culture coffee.  I also ordered the turkey and avocado sandwich; it was to die for.  I could taste the butter used to hot press the bread and the cheddar was melted perfectly.  The melted cheese, fresh avocado and aioli created a yummy, gooey mixture of amazing flavors to compliment the turkey.  The arugula side salad was nice and simple.  I loved the open atmosphere with lots of sunshine inside.  I felt a little left out that I didn't have my mac computer set up.  Overall, I loved the food and coffee and I'd enjoy trying some homemade biscuits that everyone talks about."}, {"review_id": "Gw_KTcYG5UfZcNhsAYqHUA", "user_id": "kMoeozPhhYQZNlRaZe1AhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/12/2017", "text": "I absolutely love Jubala coffee!

I have nothing against trendy coffee shops; but upon entering this seemed like a place people go to for that reason above all others. It is definitely well-loved, as it was packed with people chatting or working on laptops. Hard to find seating, long line. The workers lacked any impression that they were happy to be there, and prices were high for the size. However, it was the best PSL I've ever had.

Having grown up in Raleigh & lived in NYC for a few years, I do know I got really spoiled living in NYC where coffee shops are plentiful, delicious, & offer all kinds of truly stunning environments depending on what you want. Jubala is fine. Their sandwiches are really good. I've been going off & on since the first month they opened, & I've watched it grow from never really being too crowded to 90% of the time being so crowded you have to wait for a table. The lattes to me personally are better at Sola but if you know anything about the background of Solas management I really try to limit my time there to only going when there's no other option. It's open & airy & sometimes the employees are really nice but most of the time it's packed, loud, employees can be aloof or kinda pretentious depending on who you're getting, & it's just not the end all be all that so so so many people say it is. So it's hard. Is it the best? No. Not even close. The only thing really great is like I said the sandwiches & I do love that they serve Counterculture coffee. Is it someplace that if it was in a larger market would be as praised & insanely crowded? No, I really don't think so. But is it the best North Raleigh & Raleigh in general unfortunately has at the moment? Yes. So I'll keep going back but only because Raleigh & North Raleigh especially is so incredibly behind when it comes to the coffee shop culture/market."}, {"review_id": "W8NhhuRITbVJ0__yRWUlZw", "user_id": "FvXY-tzPWmn2XB-ZIs3Vuw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/23/2017", "text": "One of my favorite coffee shops in Raleigh! Located inside Lafayette Village, this place is normally jam packed. Speaking of jam, they make addicting homemade biscuits and jam. Keep an eye out for their seasonal jams, biscuits, waffles, and coffee. These change often based on seasons.I've had both banana and blueberry waffles and I highly recommend these unique waffles. They use pearl sugar, so when it cooks, it crystallizes giving you a crunchy outside but a soft, chewy center. You also have the option of adding toppings.The biscuits are also fluffy and deliciously complemented with jam.Great coffee, waffles, and biscuits at reasonable prices. I love it here. It's always packed but the seating is great when you are able to snag any indoor or outdoor."}, {"review_id": "KwJEqUSMFwKSJb7Wa6Kr1g", "user_id": "ecI8jn7R7H2jL7na6NexFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "Cute little coffee shop.

I am such a sucker for these biscuits, delicious! This location feels larger than the Hillsborough street spot, but the outdoor area is a bit smaller. I really like the atmosphere of Lafayette Village so it is a great spot to sit outside. I usually get the bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit, the bacon is the tasty thick cut variety. Next time I head in I'll try it with just jam since the biscuits are really good on their own. My husband went with the vanilla latte and I got the almond latte. They make their own syrups in house and I really think you can taste the difference. I highly recommend the almond.

That being said, the line wait to order wasn't too long, it was more that seating was the problem. On a warm day, no problem, as there are tons of outdoor seating options in the european-style square shopping center. We wound up sitting outside in the sun, while was manageable, but I didn't see any outdoor heaters had it been much colder.The food and coffee was worth it though. I ordered one of their waffles with banana inside and peanut butter on top. The banana added a nice sweetness to it. Just a warning, the peanut butter is all natural, so it's drier and much less sweet than if you are expecting Skippy. I ordered one of their fair trade coffees as a pour-over, but my boyfriend got the special latte which was butter pecan. WOW. And it was so pretty too!I would definitely come back here, especially during the warmer months and not at a meal-time, but I can say that this was definitely a good experience!"}, {"review_id": "S8zm_wFw63txw2ukpC-NKQ", "user_id": "dX-EG3H5ftWCnqW-GU0Pkg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Literally the only negative I can say about this place is that when it's really packed its hard to have a decent conversation because every surface in this place is hard so sound bounces everywhere. Outside of that, this place rocks!!!  The coffee is amazing!  I can tend towards being a coffee snob and when I want to be spoiled I go here. Even down to the brewing temperature and the freshness of the roasts, this place has got the science of coffee down perfect!  Their lattes aren't bad either, but do yourself a favor and get yourself plain, beautiful, unadulterated coffee when you come here if that's your speed because it is so worth it!  Service is always friendly and there's always a good variety of brews :) do yourself a favor and go treat yourself already!!!
