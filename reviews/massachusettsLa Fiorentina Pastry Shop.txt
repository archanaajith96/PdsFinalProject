Great bakery and really good delicious sandwiches such as the icaro sandwich filled with slices of prosciutto and goat cheese. Arugula hits your tongue with this mixture and makes you want more. Come here if you want to be satisfied with a nice panini or cannoli. Also get some sausage they make A+.Momo recommended."}, {"review_id": "rmWQaFbIOtrQhz0lXv4evQ", "user_id": "iNXI0m-tFxPmOn539s_HQQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2017", "text": "This pastry shop is supposed to be the best place around for cannolis, even better than the famous Mike's pastry (touristy spot in the North End) and Modern (the local favorite in Boston).

We walked in there and oh my gosh, I was absolutely in heaven. Looking at all the pastries, I saw pastries there that I have not seen since the last time I saw my grandmother(I'm Italian and native american). My boyfriend had to literally drag me away from the pastries because I was just in awe looking at it all. We ended up sitting down and he ordered the hot Italian sausage panini while I ordered the chicken parm. I wasn't able to try his sandwich because I don't do well with really hot stuff, but he said it was out of this world, it was so filling and spicy he couldn't even finish it, he had to take the other half home! My sandwich, was absolutely AMAZING!!! The chicken wasn't soggy at all, the sauce had a touch of heat to it but it wasn't bad at all, it was just enough to make your face warm and your lips tingly. The ciabatta bread was crusty on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. I can not WAIT to go back there again! My boyfriend and I both agreed that la fiorentina is our new lunch spot! Next time I go I am definitely snatching up some of the pastries!!!"}, {"review_id": "c6HY_DbLu9nKgMyROjzf1w", "user_id": "hfmGZCaWHm6tulJLtMeGKw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/28/2016", "text": "I've been coming here for 30 years. And I live over an hour away. The absolute best cannolis I've ever had. Other pastries I tried are equally good. My favorite is the camnoli. I usually buy a 5 pound pail of the cannoli cream and 2 dozen shells and fill them myself to share with friends & family. They even have a great deli inside.

It was easy to locate and we found street parking out front, but the lack of charm of its entirely modern interior was matched by the curt clerk who assisted us, despite its being a quiet Saturday morning with no one waiting behind us. In addition to large displays of Italian-American style sweets (no, sweets in Italy don't look anything like this!) La Fiorentina has imported savories for sale and a deli counter with tables. We took five different pastries to go; three of the five were alright (lobster tail, zeppole, ricotta cake slice); since the cannoli were prefilled rather than being filled to order like they should be we went with a chocolate covered one (they usually hold up better under such conditions) and clearly it had been filled from both ends, but unfortunately it was empty in the middle (no filling)! Even more unfortunate, the slice of chocolate/cherry/cream cake (think wannabe German Chocolate Cake) we received was rancid; although there were plenty of them in the tray, clearly they were well past their \"sell by\" date; we won't be back."}, {"review_id": "IEePOioNvfB3tS_GZyq35g", "user_id": "SmEl6Y54esNxAwiJgjHyVg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/25/2015", "text": "Took a nice trip up to Northampton from Springfield and ended my day here at this pastry shop.
