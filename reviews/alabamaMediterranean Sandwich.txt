This would have been a 5 star rating if they weren't out of orzo!

My coworkers and I went during lunch rush and the shop was packed. The aromas of fresh flavors hit you in the face when you walk through the door. Although it was packed we got served our food really fast. I got the red rooster and tomato basil orzo. The red rooster is little spicy but a great pick in my book. Keep serving delicious food!"}, {"review_id": "STb0z37qUi7P6dxC8BUuJQ", "user_id": "hEmnh5y-_nTwdidamvylVw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/8/2016", "text": "We were driving through and were in need of some yummy lunch. Since this place had such good reviews - we had to check it out. I saw Gabriel's review on it not being hard to eat here being vegan. I'm not 100% vegan, but try to eat at least 85%, especially when I eat out. We found parking a few streets away in a free lot. There is probably closer parking, but we aren't familiar with this area so we parked where we could. The people working were nice and helpful with suggesting what to order.I had the Falafel burger and it was good. My husband got the Moroccan chicken and he liked it too. I'm not positive if I would order the Falafel again, not because I didn't like it, but I just would like to try something else."}, {"review_id": "z3VoGU0b_JybxwNFY1UuDA", "user_id": "DdrS3cooXllsVOvQ44J6eg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "This was a pleasant surprise.  We had a gyro and the soup of the day a southern chicken minestrone, which was amazing.  Very small place but the food is first rate.  So glad we stopped."}, {"review_id": "x55HG2x_5HZvhQ8FH89-OQ", "user_id": "vv9tyG9tVm0a-A3zMADsVQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "We found out his place on yelp. We were in town on Pretty Saturday and looking for low key no wait lunch spot. It was an easy 10 minute walk from Renaissance. No customers were present. No wait. All 3 outside tables open at 2:55 pm. Party of 5. Service was great. Friendly helpful and fast. I ordered Chicken philly. I wouldn't order it again. It was chunky cubed dark meat chicken pieces. I prefer thin sliced white breast meat only. The combo was $9.89. I'd try a salad next time."}, {"review_id": "f3Q_YxM8FVVVc60NFvV2Vg", "user_id": "Vol58xF5MaI_eM-Kyvw7Kg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/8/2017", "text": "My coworkers and I stopped here for lunch because we wanted something lite and because...........Why not Mediterranean food!!! Service was prompt which moved the line very quickly. After you get your ticket you can find a place to sit and they will bring your order to you. Works for me!  I had the Moroccan chicken wrap which was a lil spicy, but nothing to wince at. Wrap was really good, very flavorful, and not to filling. One of my coworkers had the Italian job and Mediterranean cole slaw which she said was good. My other coworker had the Redneck gyro and bacon carbanra orso pasta which he said was on point. Not sure if I spelled their dishes correctly, but I was trying to eat and take notes at the same time. Although the pasta wasn't the one he thought he had ordered he said it was still quite tasty. All in all this is a great spot for a no frills quick lunch spot to dine in or to go."}, {"review_id": "mCI66t2wwvNZ6OEemYIQ2Q", "user_id": "XPwhIojdaNDGQo5bOM9qEA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "I'm from Detroit and I grew up eating A LOT of Mediterranean food. This place was one of the best places I've had in a long time. I tried the mixed grill, the Jamaican (something), and the Redneck Gyro (insert conecuh sausage here).

Its really a gyro bar that you can make amazing combination to the great Levant inspired sandwich. I had the classic gyro that was great served with a delicious tzaziki sauce that is the secret to a great gyro. The service here is not the friendly atleast on this night.

The food is flavorful and delicious, with a large variety of options at incredibly reasonable prices and good portion sizes. My Greek salad had huge chunks of fresh fruit and veggies in it and was delicious. The servers were polite and helpful and kept the restaurant tidy the entire time we ate. The restaurants style of decoration is humorous, with Celebrity photos like Ice Cube and Ice-T over the appropriate places at the beverage station. All in all it's a newfound favorite in Mobile.
