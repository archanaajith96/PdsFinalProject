We will be back!I can't believe I haven't tried this place in the 20+ years that I've been back in Tacoma - my son bought the t-shirt years ago.We had the #32 vermicelli bowls which were delicious, and also ordered the chicken Banh mi to share. It was a generous amount of food, but we were somehow able to finish it!  I also had no food reaction whatsoever, which speaks volumes. I eat clean and notice when food has additives and things it shouldn't have. It's also why we don't eat out often. I had zero reaction to any of it, which is unusual when we eat any Asian cuisine.We will definitely add this place to our rotation of takeout places. We mostly cook from scratch, but this place will be a top choice for when we don't want to, or cannot cook."}, {"review_id": "Oy5nFHWYz5Nh2JeO2ofq9w", "user_id": "IrKXDcK5UMf1BP0NDWdTpg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Fairly good pho. However the service is such that after visiting 4 times to see if it was just a abnormality, we won't be going back. I always try my best to be respectful and appreciative of the services restaurants offer. So usually i get great response back. However in this restaurant, I've always received cold stares and cold dialogues (?). It feels like they(it's actually just one guy) don't want me there. After the fourth such encounters, his wish(?) is granted.

There were only two things I didn't really care for.  The tripe in my pho is larger than most places.  I usually order tripe for the texture however the large pieces of tripe left an overpowering tripe flavor in my mouth.  Additionally, on the tv they had a show about children with clef lips.  The children were getting check ups with the doctors and it created an odd eating atmosphere.Other than that it was a great hole in the wall!"}, {"review_id": "qJkteYVUD6pqgQDh_-as-g", "user_id": "mZXd508iD7CTopfMslFwew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I love pho king.  I have reviewed a bunch of pho restaurants, this restaurant has the best overall experience.  The service is fast and the food is tasty.

They gave me beef.  No big deal, sandwiches were decent and a good price. We came back again and wanted to try their pho.  Both of us ordered the brisket pho, one regular bowl, one large bowl. They ended up giving us one large brisket bowl, one large tendon and brisket bowl. Noodles were not cooked very well... they were still underdone.  Skimpy on the meat. I also ended up in the bathroom for quite some time... less than an hour later.  Prices are pretty good here, but the food is all but mediocre, if that."}, {"review_id": "RmhmBSpXJklGRXT90kKYhA", "user_id": "PfL_EuDIIr8BaspyhWX_1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "This is my favorite pho place and I don't even order pho!

They're certainly the best out of all the ones I've tried on Hilltop (and this is almost a little pho-town district). The storefront is nice and basic, and so is the dining room. The tables and chairs are clean but they're pretty beat up. The room is clean but simple--basic box with linoleum flooring. The staff hustle and bustle and the place always seems to be full, even when the street outside is quiet. They have a pretty good menu with all the usual suspects plus a couple extras here and there. They're justifiably well-known for their pho and banh mi. We tried both and both are excellent. The pho has all the bases covered--good fresh condiments, nice light chewy noodles, fresh meat. The broth is the key of course, and it has nice depth and complexity: great bone marrow base with nicely-balanced seasonings. The banh mi are excellent--bread is crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside. The meat is fresh, grilled very well, and full of flavor. The pickled bits have nice explosive flavor that works well with everything else. They're cheap and filling...pretty tough to imagine a better sandwich value in town. The fresh rolls are great, too, and we put away a couple pots of tea last week to wash these meals down. My mom has loved this place for years, though she can't bring herself to say the name as written. I'm tickled I got my mom to go check out pho places, and I'm even more tickled to finally make it in and see what she was raving about."}, {"review_id": "VvW7v0L9eNXSAs1fauwr9w", "user_id": "Os0htjQHtj5NEGj4apuKmg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/26/2018", "text": "Absolutely amazing.

It's that good.Meal #1 Dined in with my gf. I got the grilled pork and egg rolls noodle bowl (bun). The grilled pork is perfection, sweet and savory. The portion is big and all the ingredients are fresh. I also tried her veggie egg rolls and veggie pho, which were tasty (if you're into that sort of thing).Meal #2Leftover bun for breakfast. Yes it was that much food. #lifehackprotip, finish the egg rolls during the original meal because they tend to disintegrate overnight if you've mixed the sauce in.Meal #3Took home a grilled pork bahn mi from the night before, ate it for breakfast. Same superior pork in a big sandwich with pickled veggies and a creamy sauce. Pho King throws onions into the mix, a surprising but not unwelcome twist on the classic.Meal #4 Went back with a friend for dinner. Ordered the house special pho, which came with beef, tripe, tendon, and meatballs. The large was just $1 more than the regular, and was a really large portion. The beef was fattier than other pho places, which was a nice change of pace.Overall great prices for big portions of high quality Vietnamese food. So far this is my go-to spot in Tacoma."}, {"review_id": "_-6QBBnIKJRet7SCyk2MRQ", "user_id": "Lk9kDdFEMO7YY7kNBymVfg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "The food is good but the service is not so much.
