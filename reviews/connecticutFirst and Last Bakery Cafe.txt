If you are traveling through Hartford, you have to plug this in to your gps and stop in. It's a 5 min drive from either I-84 or 1-91. I live about 45 min away but knew I'd be traveling through the Capitol today and this would be a must stop this morning. When you walk in, the place is wicked clean and the employees are super cool. A real burst of positive energy hits you. The dishes they serve as well as the bakery items are some of the best I've seen in the state. If you like homemade hash, this is the place. The food is really fresh and delish!!! It's great to see a place like this out there as they are far and few between. Can't beat it. Thnx 1st and Last. You have a great place."}, {"review_id": "ExH9Y0xq1bVPfnISezAxJQ", "user_id": "l3-iufAUr46hmFiEanW88Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "I was really looking forward to this place but I found their breakfast sandwich prices to be about 20 to 25 percent higher than most places that serve similar sandwiches. The breakfast panini I had was a total disappointment as it was mostly bread (see my pic).They also didn't have any dark roast coffee, which really surprised me actually. They had some ridiculous synthetic banana hazlenut, but no dark roast?  What's the world coming to? Coffee is definitely not their thing...though baking is supposed to be...keep reading.They have tons of baked goods and they look really good, but I got a ricotta croissant pastry (free via Yelp check-in!!!) to go and ate it later that day.  It didn't suit me well at all.  Way too much butter; overpowering and it made me feel crummy.  That's saying something folks because generally I have an iron stomach.Another fail, it took a solid 15 minutes to get my breakfast sandwich delivered to my table and they screwed up my wife's sandwich by bringing her the wrong one.  They promptly made her the correct one, but failed to include the red velvet treat that was supposed to accompany her sandwich.  By this point, she was tired of complaining and didn't bother to let them know they'd screwed up again.  Sigh.Not sure I'd go back here, which is a shame as I really wanted to love this place."}, {"review_id": "p0VgaWr5maUxCy1m9iWfKA", "user_id": "fpJenf7KXCh-jGmyr4QWGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "Love starting my day here on some weekends when I have errands to do.

Incredible assortment of baked goods displayed beautifully behind clean glass cases. It's spacious and well decorated. You order your food at the counter and are given a number. You find a table and they bring your food out to you. I have been coming here for years...have never found the staff to be particularly friendly and the prices are a little on the high side...and yet I keep coming back...mainly because of the many options that are prepared so well. Unless you come early, finding a table on a Sunday may be challenging...you may have to wait a while hoping your food doesn't come out before you have found a table!!!!"}, {"review_id": "3ZD6VZPGliYNjs6TkjTbtQ", "user_id": "fKY68BxON40g3d2gBFdIKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "This place is amazing, the food was delicious, my food was prompt after order and there hospitality there was above and beyond.

I was very pleased with my overall experience! Very pretty ambiance inside, I loved the ceiling lined with different baskets and soft music playing on the speakers. Gave the restaurant a unique look. Large selection of pastries to choose from as well as breakfast items. I ordered the egg, cheese, bacon & tomato sandwich on a croissant. It was delicious! Best breakfast sandwich I've ever had at a restaurant! It was very fresh and they even added herbs/spices for seasoning. The waitress also gave me a mini banana nut muffin on my plate. Service was fast and friendly. Coffee station was serve yourself. The one I chose was low because it just dribbled out but I was able to get my cup filled. Overall I had a good experience and would definitely go back to try their lunch menu."}, {"review_id": "ecplqP765qpp9hV4uNWUKA", "user_id": "lu_toXQkDop400dP9YvgEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "The staff here is so friendly and polite.
