Happy to see it hasn't really changed a bit in the years. The decor has pretty much stayed exactly how I remember it. Friendly service. And they have birch beer!Cheap, good eats. For 3 people, the bill came to $40, and we left feeling stuffed. I had a chicken gyro, which was really good. The other members of my party tried the XL Texas wiener and the cheesesteak. You have to order onion rings and french fries for the table when you come here. Many options when it comes to the fries - you can top them with gravy & cheese, chili or just cheese. (I usually stick with just cheese because I'm basic.) The onion rings are probably one of the best I've ever had. I'm craving them as I write this review. If I worked closer to Libby's, I could see this being a regular lunch spot. I can't wait to come back."}, {"review_id": "RD_s8_aIQhaGrrYIV3V30g", "user_id": "D8ulGZ2frxVCAE6hVcVu8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Hot dog - deliciousHamburger - delicious Cole slaw - deliciousFish sandwich - delicious French fries - amazingly delicious And my 3 year old actually ate her lunch!  She usually takes two bites and gets distracted at restaurants."}, {"review_id": "g0NFVzJkM6IarPJ98aC_pA", "user_id": "vJu277U6CpM6S-GdMZKP9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "I think they have the absolute best hot dogs out of all the dog joints.

LIbby's Lunch, whose claim to fame is the Texas wiener, the distinction being the \"chili\" its topped with. Since 1936 Libby's has been serving up their food in Patterson, to great success, and claims to be the progenitor of the original Texas wiener.Me and a couple of friends rolled up close to closing sometime after nine and stayed well past closing (10 PM). Staff was extremely attentive and friendly throughout- especially our waitress. We all pigged out pretty hardcore- Libby's being our last planned stop of the day. (Spoiler, it wasn't, didn't get in until like 6am, stayed up till like 10.)I personally loaded up on a Chili-Cheese Dog with bacon, a Bacon Cheese Burger, some chili cheese fries, an order of  chicken fingers, and an Egg Cream. I was one of the last people to actually dig in (Taking photos and such) but before i did my friend told me about the chili- said it wasn't like any other chili he had before- and he was right.Libby's affectionately refers to its \"chili\" as sauce, and with good reason- this isn't any kind of chili i'd be familiar with. Consisting of extremely fine ground/minced meat, with what i think is tomato paste, some seasoning along the lines of some primo sloppy joe- with some of the more aromatic herbs mixed in for an extremely unique flavor. If i had to describe it id say earthy? Either way it was fantastic, and completely different from what you'd typically expect or associate with chili. The dynamic of the sauce also changed what id have expected things to taste like, and paired surprisingly well, especially with the bacon- my gawrsh. Throw  like 4-6 slices of bacon broken up in a quart of that stuff and i'd go HAM on it solo- suffice to say my chili-cheese dog was the MVP star of the show.Burger was pretty flavorful, didn't skimp on the bacon, was seasoned pretty well to- thumbs up on a hand raised right, fries also came out nice and golden, slightly crisp, but falls apart once you get into it- needless to say my chili cheese fries were also phenomenal- top-5 ranking for sure- though a slot lower than it would have otherwise been after Mondays trip.The weakest candidate here was the chicken tenders, which were pretty decent but lacked the same flavor or kick the burgers and dogs had- breading sorta reminiscent of Chinese-food chicken tenders, and meat halfway between lean chicken breast at home and McDonalds chicken nuggets.Service was fantastic, food was produced quite quickly considering the gargantuan order we collectively placed. (Another chili cheese fries, burger, and dog on behalf of one friend, and a second platter of fingers, large fry, and dog courtesy of the other- alongside my meal.)Suffice to say i think we were all pleased with the experience and wish the location were a bit closer to home. Lord knows id be a regular here if it were even remotely close. (Heck if not for the food the customer service.) Staff at Libby's really take care of you- and i'm not just saying that because the waitress was a total sweetheart. (She was though- even wanted to pose for a photo when she noticed me snapping shots for this review lol.)Flavor & Presentation 4/5   |   Service & Speed 5/5   |   Price & Proportion  4/5Overall 4.25/5"}, {"review_id": "gdqWv_0TH42i4NN5AFvmEQ", "user_id": "jP-W5uFr2npf1TfwDJFOug", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "When all else fails, you dont feel like cooking and want a good burger and dog joint thus is the place.  No need for a long review.

It's exterior may be decrepit, even foreboding,but inside is modern and friendly with excellent comfort food at very fair prices. Hot dogs -- especially Texas dogs -- are grilled and split, pastrami as good as any I've had in my native Brooklyn, and the beer is cold, fresh and inexpensive. A great way to cap a visit to the falls."}, {"review_id": "AR9z-InFQwvKWCxE-T-PsQ", "user_id": "TB2hc9wxpDyGDYbOk0GWhw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "I went on the recommendation of a food writer who covers New Jersey to get some takeout. I'm commenting less on the food than the completely rude and indifferent treatment I received from the person who took my order and my money. He may have been the owner. He just didn't seem to care - completely nasty - and I will never go back. I lead food tours and was in the midst of leading my first food tour focusing on the Peruvian specialties in Paterson, but we went to see the Great Falls and I put Libby's on my map as a potential stop. My group agreed that this place did not belong on the tour. The Peruvian places where we ate gave us terrific service and we gave them  huge tips.

It was a Sunday morning at 11:30am. I wasn't sure it was open since I didn't see many cars in the lot and there was no signs regarding operating hours. Plus, one of the two doors were locked. I gingerly entered through the unlocked door and then saw a few customers which set my mind at ease. I was greeted and told to sit where I liked. I ordered the texas weiner and cheeseburger, both all the way and fries. I enjoyed my meal while listening to modern pop and watching TNT on the television. This place is very \"streets\" as the middle aged anglo lady spoke as if you was a teenager from Washington Heights. The food was fine and I especially liked the fries."}, {"review_id": "XK2dLJgHJyB1QANiJ_I7VQ", "user_id": "U7RCnO4Y_SbuKLsFvwTIww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/23/2015", "text": "Located right next to the Paterson falls, Libby's  is another landmark hot dog joint in northern NJ. Love all the way sauce? Don't feel like driving to Hot Grill? (In my case Libbys is closer to home). Come to Libby's! Its a much smaller version of the hot grill....hot dogs are cooked differently and of course there's a variation in the famous all the way sauce but overall its the same kinda place. On this occasion we went with cheese/gravy fries, onion rings and all the way dogs. The dogs with all the way sauce were scrumptious (and the real reason I came here). Cheese/gravy fries, ehhh, not impressed. Mad gravy and no cheese, bad ratio. Onion rings were golden, crisp and large..I enjoyed those. The service on this particular occasion was not great but that's not always the case. While hot grill is absolutely my favorite place to cure my crave for hot dogs all the way, Libbys comes in at a close second. Check Libby's out if you want to experience some hot dogs all the way and while you're at it go experience the Paterson Falls as well."}, {"review_id": "dSSIUGAMPfRlZY0_ipTkLA", "user_id": "f1E0guw8Gh6NEc4MAsqTgw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/26/2017", "text": "Not all that for breakfast.

We where nearby at the Great Falls and after learning they had been the first to introduce the \"Hot Texas Weiner\" i knew I had to stop in and try one. The staff is nice and the service is prompt, but if this place sets the bar in terms of what a hot texas weiner is I must say that Hot Texas Weiner's are the most awed thing I have ever tasted. I took one bite of it and promptly offered the rest of it to my daughter who absolutely loves hot dogs. She took one bit and then refused to eat any more of it. Perhaps Hot Texas Weiner's are one of those things that you have to have a taste for. I mean heck I eat crickets and bugs with out an issue and people think those are gross so maybe its the same deal with these things.There are tons of great reviews for this place so either I just don't understand what a Hot Texas Weiner is supposed to taste like or everyone else who is saying these things are great has spent there life eating from a garbage can and doesn't know what food is supposed to taste like.Personally I'll never return but on the plus side I can check off the box on my Bucket List that says eat a Hot Texas Weiner at the spot they where created. Granted that item was never on my bucket list to begin with and after having one I know why!"}, {"review_id": "-hxA79K8rxd8Fm1R07ShUA", "user_id": "Yes6M0IUK6C2p1e6jrqZBQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/12/2016", "text": "Seeing the sights in Paterson lead me to this place. It has a such a warm friendly vibe to it. You can definitely tell all the locals frequent this neighborhood spot. I tried to keep it light but ended up going a little overboard. Vanilla milkshake, fries, double decker egg salad sandwich and onion rings for me. Hot dog covered in chili sauce, burger with bacon, and another order of french fries for him. Everyone was good, filling, and tasty. Super cheap too which is always a plus. After eating it was a bit hard to walk around so I suggest coming hungry! If I'm in the neighborhood again I'll def stop by."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/libbys-lunch-paterson?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
