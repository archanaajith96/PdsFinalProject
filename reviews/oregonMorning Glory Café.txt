The environment is very comfortable and the customers are extremely diverse. The employees are awesome and the food is AMAZING! Every single bite of every single item was heavenly! We each got an entree to share and ordered a third as an appetizer. That's how difficult it was to decide. Vegan places can be hard to find and when you do, sometimes they are bland or not very creative. This place is nothing like that! They had flavorful combinations, and improvements on the old breakfast standards. You seriously can't go wrong here! Oh!! And the coffee! We are kind of coffee snobs, so most places, we order a cup and may or may not finish it. Rarely do we order a second cup! I wanted our server to keep the refills coming! Lol We can't wait to come back and try more options!"}, {"review_id": "CJbIBBkMk5ogy9OuQOhMVQ", "user_id": "zx8_gqHf0tpKLDL9M0f1UA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I can't say enough good things about this place, even as a meat eater. Service is always friendly, food is delicious and healthy. I always look at the specials but end up eating the same thing anyway--the pesto omelette w a dill roll (must try!) and fruit instead of potatoes. The fruit here is great, unlike some places. I've loved other things I've tried, like the carrot cake waffle, but I love my pesto omelette and I love the soysage. I also love the green hot sauce. I like to get cold brew coffee here."}, {"review_id": "yicIQZjy4wWcHjFfmEEakg", "user_id": "lrmobTP2jsCD9W2e6fZ1OQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/11/2018", "text": "Yumm.

This little gem was a great find here on yelp. Thanks for getting me here reviewers!!  I need to start with the menu!!  Very inventive and imaginative mixed with lots of choices for the picky and the not so picky.  I got to tell you though my favorite was ordering a veggie hash with my pick of sauces to boot. I went with yeast cheese sauce as it's an old favorite of mine. I was very excited to even see it on the menu. The veggies were not overcooked and there were plenty to be had.  It's called the 3 sisters but you can order half orders so I ordered 1.5 sisters which at first they did not get. SMH.. hee hee.. The place is small however so it's not where you can bring in a huge group and then dilly dally after that. It's just not very nice to say the least. Folks coming in for breakfast are usually a bit hungover and just need to have a sit and get some good food. The servers were fast on their feet and really paid attention to what needs to be done, super efficient and super nice.Also, the location is pretty cool as well and they are right next to a cajun restaurant that I'll be checking out next time I'm in the hood."}, {"review_id": "LxYUmIeN-aP4BwK9k330NQ", "user_id": "jW1fAOe_KLoUMcRfeQcuxw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "I visited this cafe on a Saturday afternoon around 2 pm with my mom, sister and boyfriend. There was a 25 min wait, which I expected. When we were seated, I ordered chai lattes for myself and my mom, and my boyfriend ordered an orange juice. To eat, I ordered the Mamas scramble. It's a standard tofu scramble that comes with potatoes and toast. They offered me vegan butter for the toast which I got overly excited about. My mom ordered the morning sandwich and my boyfriend got three scrambled eggs with potatoes and toast. My sister wasn't too hungry, so she ordered a smoothie. The chai lattes came out semi warm and tasted a bit watered down. I wouldn't order it again, but I wish I could would have checked out the drink menu a bit more as they have some yummy sounding drink specials like vanilla cardamom lattes. My boyfriends OJ was fresh squeezed (like I'm pretty sure they squeezed it right after he ordered it) and was insanely good. Totally recommend loading up on one of those! I really liked the tofu scramble. It had good flavour and got even better after I tossed some ketchup on it. The toast was diner like, a bit fluffy, just average sliced bread. I love potatoes and usually get excited about them, but these ones were so crunchy I thought they were going to cut my mouth open. Plus they were barely warm. My boyfriend really enjoyed his meal and my mom took half of hers to go. The food was good, but my sisters smoothie came out when we were almost finished eating. Overall, the experience was mediocre. I wouldn't jump at the chance to go back here, but I wouldn't protest if a friend wanted to go. They also offer takeaway pastries and have lots of vegan options. If you're not feeling a full meal, maybe get a takeaway pastry and drink. I saw a vegan pumpkin cinnamon roll on my way out and it was tempting. The staff are moderately friendly. They weren't necessarily super nice or attentive, but they weren't completely rude. This is a decent place for a casual vegan breakfast, but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. I was really hoping to love it as I'd heard great things, but it seemed like there were just a few setbacks."}, {"review_id": "uaxWl9Bqg6tX4dLp3BvJ5Q", "user_id": "nEnvPEBoZE5pR5700Afw7A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "My favorite place for breakfast/brunch in town.

I do not care for eggs, waffles, pancakes, or french toast. HOWEVER, when my boyfriend and I stumbled a cross this little gem by the train station one morning we decided to give it a try. I WAS COMPLETELY ASTONISHED BY MY NEW FOUND LOVE OF VEGAN BREAKFAST FOOD.        I had ordered the Tofu scramble and within my first bite I could taste all the spices and herbs tossed together to make this lovely meal. I was so overwhelmingly happy that I had found a breakfast place that I could finally eat at with my breakfast enthusiast boyfriend.      Because it is a bit pricey and busy (understandably) I have only been back once, but the second time when I had the three sisters I yet again was not disappointed.      If you have the time I fully recommend this place for breakfast or brunch. Since it is busy it is harder to get a group together, so I recommend just going with one or two friends.     I personally find the bar window seats to be my favorite spot. I haven't tried their coffee but their hot chocolate and chai teas are decent, more of an earthy taste (which is definitely appealing to most people here but I'm a sugar freak when it comes to drinks). I would 10/10 recommend this to any vegetarian or vegans that have trouble finding good breakfast food restaurants.*Update*I went back again today (a couple months later) and had the scramble and tried the gravy and ommgggggg.

YUM!The wait and kitchen staff is fantastic, they graciously accommodated my request. And afterwards one of the waitresses said she was going to try it herself. I hope it ends up on their menu!

This was my first time eating at this particular cafe, as I was visiting from out of town, and I was very pleasantly surprised. The vibe of the cafe was cute and earthy, tailored to the slightly edgy, vegan, aesthetic crowd. The artwork on the walls and the color schemes utilized both inside and out are perfect for picture taking and set the cafe's tone indirectly yet effectively. The seating is comfortable and even the menus are quite appealing to the eye. While waiting to be seated there was a little time to look at the pastries offered and a bit of the drink menu, which was nice. My friend and I went there and we were told that we could seat ourselves wherever we wanted. We chose a booth and were quickly attended by our server, who asked us if we would like any drinks. There is a self-serve station for waters and a few other creams and such. I liked the idea of the self-serve station, but it was positioned somewhat awkwardly and you had to walk through and near a lot of other people attempting to enjoy their breakfast to get to it, which was a tad frustrating. The food itself was a true treat. I am not vegan or vegetarian, so some of the food seemed a little wack to me, but I can certainly see why this cafe would be very special to those who are vegan. I ordered pancakes and my server even asked me if I wanted butter or vegan butter. It was sorta strange and I almost felt convicted saying \"just butter\" but it was a gesture that I'm sure many vegans would appreciate. My friend asked our server some questions about the menu and she appeared knowledgeable and prepared, which was a huge plus in my book. The pancakes were different than what you would expect from a traditional breakfast location, but not in a bad way. It was actually one giant pancake and it was somewhat difficult to pour syrup on the pancake without spilling it off the plate, which was not ideal. Nonetheless the food tasted amazing, and I thoroughly enjoyed what I ate of it. I also ordered a glass of orange juice which was freshly squeezed and absolutely delicious. Good sized glass and extremely refreshing. When I went to pay, however, I was a little disappointed. It seemed clear that whoever was working the cash register was simply following a script \"hope you enjoyed your food\", and when I tried to strike up a light conversation as I checked out she seemed highly disinterested and hardly responded to what I said with anything more than a false smile. Aside from a few small issues, however, I had a superb time and would undoubtedly visit here again if I was invited with somebody. However, nothing stood out as special to me in any way, and I might just prefer to check out a different breakfast location instead if I was choosing the destination. Cutesy decor, patchy service, and slightly above average food. Worth checking out, if willing to deal with a few bumps during your time out."}, {"review_id": "zJ6GPAWFfq_9pvVsd9fpgA", "user_id": "zL4Ryl1EIwqMOpbaPdAbFw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/18/2017", "text": "Hands down, the best vegan breakfast I've ever had. However, it is not a secret how good this place is and it's ALWAYS packed with a wait to be seated. It'd be awesome if they'd open another location to ease the crowding a little bit, they seem to be doing quite well!I always get the morning sandwich. The biscuits are actually like real biscuits. The \"soysage\" and tofu \"egg\" patty are both wonderfully seasoned and complement each other very well. The produce is always super fresh and flavorful. Not the best potatoes, but definitely above average in terms of crispiness and seasoning. My only gripe is the thing is so huge it's served open face, so you have to alternate bites instead of being able to get the whole thing at once. They also serve pretty good coffee here, which is a plus for me.The service is very friendly. The space is also super cute and always has a great selection of seasonal themed art.
