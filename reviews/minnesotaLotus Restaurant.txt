Its a cute little restaurant with cute neon lighting- My sister and I pigged OUT! We got the spring rolls with shrimp and the crab wontons. No one is better at making crabmeat wontons than my mother but this place came close! It had the perfect amount of creaminess and the sauce was great!The spring rolls were also great. Nothing too special except for the sauce! Idk what it is but it was sooooo good!Then we got a bowl of pho with beef and a shrimp pad thai.The pho was a little different from others but it did not need any other seasoning and for the pad thai- i just wished it were a bit more spicy but hey, at least i dont have any stomach pains! Overall this was a very satisfying meal and definitely cant wait to eat here again!"}, {"review_id": "bonsGBcIWPdKnIvYgVw_kw", "user_id": "ZwX7eUxRmXoeWX8wbpPcWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "This place gets 4.5 stars in my opinion. The only reason to deduct half a star is because the restaurant is located in a shady shopping center in downtown Minneapolis. The parking lot was full in the plaza, and it is a very small plaza with just a handful of spaces. I was able to find a spot on the street around the corner from the restaurant. But as I walked towards Lotus, I did confront some shady characters that had me feeling uneasy.On to the good stuff... What I really liked about Lotus was the restaurant reminded me of a small quaint place serving no frills Chinese and Vietnamese comfort food. I visited late Saturday afternoon around 5pm and found a table immediately before the crowds arrived. Btw, I had read that the restaurant gets crowded during peak hours. Once I sat and glanced over the menu, I immediately ordered some hot tea and went with one of my go-to entrees, sesame chicken. I would have ordered soup as a starter, but soup is only offered Pho style in a huge bowl with prices ranging from $5.99 - $8.99. When I say Pho soup, I mean a Vietnamese tradition consisting of broth, rice noodles and meat...Like a giant bowl of Ramen noodles. It's a meal in and of itself. So I just stuck with my sesame chicken entrée which came with white rice.The menu was pretty diversified and interesting.  Besides the Pho soups, they offer plenty of other noodle specialty entrees as well as chicken, beef, pork and shrimp dishes. There are fried rice plates as well and vegetarian options.After ordering, service was real fast. I could tell they serve their customers quickly in and out of the restaurant so they can receive plenty of volume and traffic. My sesame chicken was about as good as it gets though! It was hot and fresh and you could tell it came right out of the wok. The chicken was crispy, only quality white meat, and accompanied with fried onions in a beautifully tangy brown sauce. It was delicious! I enjoyed the entire entrée and the white rice was a great accompaniment. My meal was ideal and totally hit the mark. Now I understand how Lotus has received so many reviews.Prices are extremely fair and reasonable. For all the quality food, it's well worth the price! If I had to make one suggestion, my server never refilled my tea or attended to me after taking my order. Though by the time I finished eating, the restaurant was packed and there was a wait in the lobby. One more thing, I used the bathroom to wash my hands, and I never even think to mention anything about restaurant bathroom's....but the men's restroom was absolutely spotless, clean and bordered on looking brand new! It was a sight to see considering the restaurant is pretty ordinary looking on the inside and situated in a precarious little shopping plaza from the outside.Overall, I'm so grateful I researched restaurants to dine at while exploring Minneapolis for the weekend because otherwise I never would have stumbled upon Lotus on my own. Other than the low class people that hang out in the shopping center and surrounding streets, Lotus restaurant is as good as it gets!"}, {"review_id": "_BuAsM73wyEJaoCIyYq3Pg", "user_id": "gRC_zXHq700y-mMW2_dQhQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Ate here with my boyfriend over the weekend. Arrived at 6 pm on a Saturday and it was pretty busy but we were seated right away. Don't be turned away if you see a long line through the window - it's likely mostly people waiting for take out. We ordered the house special lo mein and made it a combo plate with a side of fresh spring rolls. I recommend the lo mein- it was full of vegetables, beef, chicken, and shrimp though it was a tad oily for me. Upgrade to a combo plate and you have a meal for 2 under $20. We were disappointed with the BBQ pork fresh spring rolls- one of our spring rolls was missing the BBQ pork (!!?!).  All in all, I do like the food. I gave it 3 stars because the location isn't great (parking is difficult around dinner hour) and the ambiance is just okay. Maybe I need to try the uptown location next :)"}, {"review_id": "-3w34WtPVjC4sEvO1l7d-g", "user_id": "-bOyT63qFE5l9Y2hkhSMIg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "The food is definitely the best Vietnamese food I ever have had, and this is from a California-native, who is used to eating Pho and Banh Mi.

Our conditions were that there had to be something exciting and vegetarian on the menu, and the parking had to be easy. Luckily, Lotus Restaurant satisfied both those conditions!The location: the restaurant shares an itty bitty parking lot with some retail space and a two pump gas station, so it's weirdly situated. There's lots of street parking nearby, especially because of the park. Yes, you'll probably have to pay for street parking.The place: when you walk in, the first thing you see is the counter. Lotus seems to do a healthy amount of take-out business, so we saw at least two people pick up food during the five minutes we waited to be seated. The seating is a little cramped and on the smaller side, but it was also bustling when we were there, so it felt a little crowded. Our table was in the back corner which afforded us some privacy and felt pretty cozy when we settled in. The service: our server was very kind, and the speed with which our food came out piping hot was superb. The food: now the food is where I rave. The food was fantastic. We got vegetable egg rolls--the outside was crispy and the inside was flavorful. They were also HOT. I got the chow mein with crispy noodles and tofu while Hubsy got the chow fun with mock duck. Both were scrumptious in their own special ways. The chow mein had a sweet-ish garlic sauce which I couldn't get enough of. The crispy noodles soaked up that sauce without getting soggy which is a sort of magic I don't understand but definitely appreciate. And the tofu was golden perfection. The chow fun was also good...but I was partial to my own dish, so I didn't munch on Hubsy's too much. So. Good. Would definitely go back."}, {"review_id": "y19D7oIR5acvb-526DwQuQ", "user_id": "Dl8UzehqTZNMfuGksnvoRQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Pretty delicious food at Lotus.

Lots of people order takeout, but there's also a good amount of space for dining in. I sat at the counter facing out the window (since I dined in solo) which wasn't weird, as a couple others had the same idea. I ordered the egg rolls for an appetizer, which were hot, crispy, flavorful, and done just right. I then ordered pho (of course - my default dish!) which you can get in a small or large bowl. It was decent, no real complaints about it (but my standards for pho are always very high since my parents immigrated from Vietnam). I've also gotten banh mi for takeout and it's excellent! Spicy and flavorful, but a little heavy on the mayo, so be sure to ask for that on the side. Very satisfied with my Lotus experience.

There's street parking nearby so it's not too big of a deal if there aren't spots available in the lot.What's nice about this location is that I've noticed several people eating here by themselves on different occasions and it wasn't awkward. Sometimes you can't find anyone to eat out with you but you want to get out of the house so it's nice to have somewhere to go like Lotus. It isn't very large but there's a good amount of seating and getting a table hasn't ever been problematic in my experience.I ordered an egg roll noodle salad. The egg rolls had crispy exteriors with a flavorful, savory interior. The noodles were chewy and were well matched by the crunchiness of the fresh cucumber, carrot, cilantro, etc. I like adding sriracha for a more dynamic taste. The portion size was generous and allowed for leftovers.Lotus is a great choice among the Vietnamese options locally and this location is great for wandering around downtown before or after eating."}, {"review_id": "u7PmKKo2cBcpssS8H1_9Wg", "user_id": "FefoKP85Cc3ACjRpikXOaw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "Lotus serves a fantastic bowl of pho.

I didn't like the Americanized names of the dishes which were printed on the menu. For example the bun or vermicelli was titled \"Vietnamese salad\" on the menu.

Each appetizer was well made and hyped me up for the entree. The entree took a while to come to me, but once it did, I was very satisfied. The portion was huge, the meat was tender, and the spice level was just tingly enough to make my nose tickle. The service was quite good as well.

There's even vegetarian options for pho (tofu).UPDATE: Came here again and had the lunch special (first speciality entree on the menu, with mock duck as protein). Both this and the pho last night were in the salty side, but otherwise totally worth the price and visit here. It was people lunch time so there was a wait list to be seated.
