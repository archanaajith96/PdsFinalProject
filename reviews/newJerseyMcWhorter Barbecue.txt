Great place to get big portions for little money. I came here on a rainy day and the bbq, fries, and rice really hit the spot.

Therefore competition is key to running a successful and tasty product. This place failed in so many ways.Chicken was dry and lacking flavor, however ribs were acceptable. To be honest, Portuguese BBQ will always be inferior to the southern style of grilling. But this place is equipped enough to make something better. Let's talk about the vegetables. Why use  frozen or canned vegetables. Cheaply cutting corners is not a good idea when in either direction another BBQ resides. Fried banana: it was okay, I just was not expecting a real banana. Sweet plantain? Maybe that's too pricy, another cost cut I guess.Yes it's cheap and a lot of food. However all the BBQ spots in the area are- so why not go to the best one... FERRY BBQ... Even South BBQ is better than this place."}, {"review_id": "GwdXTcR0DUd9Y11cudYWug", "user_id": "awIOb0IxEcjl970S5Zu95g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "This is our go to spot when it comes to amazing bbq in the Ironbound.

Let's just say no one is going to drop their panties off anytime soon. I was hoping for more flavor, like some garlicky chicken with a nice sauce that goes along with but the only thing that came along with my protein was rice, salad or fries.  Price wise, it's reasonable and space wise, it's good and can seat a lot of people.

It was a Thursday night around 730pm and though I arrived there later than most, they were seated comfortably at a large table.We ordered a bunch of entrees to go family style and share. We had vegetables, BBQ, pork ribs, and chicken.Again, though I arrived a late, there was still plenty of food! I assume they were served quickly if they had gotten there at 7:30, ordered, and for the most part had finished eating by the time I got there around 8:10. I will say it did get very warm in the restaurant as it started to fill up.

The menu is pretty simple, but I honestly don't even know what the full menu offers because 99% of the people that go there go there for the chicken and ribs. They have the traditional churrasqueria bbq pit where they bbq they're chicken and ribs. While the chicken and ribs are roasting over the coals, they dowse it in a spiced hot sauce. The sauce is a little tangy and a little spicy but it is delicious. If you order the combo you'll get half a chicken and ribs with fries and rice for around $13. And it's enough for 3-4 ppl. I usually go with my gf and order half a chicken with fries and rice and two cans of soda and only spend $10 and leave stuffed."}, {"review_id": "1pSvHytq94xK00J2czY1MA", "user_id": "1NqILK1IQzjovsQw6Cpbng", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/16/2016", "text": "I live in the ironbound, so for me, the reigning cheap, tasty bbq of the area is Ferry St BBQ.  However, I noticed that there is also another similar, portugese BBQ restaurant very close by that grills their food using the same giant grill technique.  So I ventured out and decided to give it a shot and ordered a half order of beef ribs.  I can't say I was disappointed, as the beef was juicy and tender, but it just did not meet the extremely high standards set forth by Ferry St BBQ.  At Ferry St, the fries just taste crisper, the rice is more flavorful, and the meat is juicier.  One aspect that is superior at McWhorter BBQ, however, is that the dine in experience is much nicer, with a lot more space.  Adding to that, the staff seemed very cool and welcoming."}, {"review_id": "ux5gePYplhFRNFpBgxW5SQ", "user_id": "Z64vWUm-rErQbf_fvg_Eng", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Ok food.

It's a Portuguese bbq spot that's cash only with amazing prices where you could probably feed a group of 4 big appetites for around $20. I dig variety, so I like the platter with everything on it. My favorites are the beef ribs, pork chops, and chicken. Even their rice and fries are dangerous because they're so bomb. You can ask for bbq sauce, but I prefer to drizzle hot sauce on everything.Service is okay though; sometimes I have to call for the server's attention because it's usually so busy there. TVs are always playing soccer. Takeout comes in handy because I live so close by.
