It exudes a laid-back, friendly vibe with patrons ranging from dads with toddlers to groups of college students to those enjoying their later years. And the food! The apple crumble French toast is indulgent and worth every calorie. Thumbs up for the Korean bbq bowl and mushroom omelet. All items taste even better when accompanied by a cup of Colectivo coffee. We love Simple and will keep on returning during our WI weekend getaways."}, {"review_id": "REj9rgHe5Su-RoFQWy7hLg", "user_id": "Pkhd_6KpzaBBSo2NrhFIuA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "I came here for the first time last weekend. It was a nice atmosphere, fun colors, clean. I ordered the Apple Crumble French Toast and OMG it was amazing! The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the complete lack of service. It took forever to get anyone to come to our table for water, then to order, then to get food, then we had to track our waitress down to get our check."}, {"review_id": "SthtQhXE33Xqiusa9HKhvw", "user_id": "nSCt3GTz9MM1J43NgyM-1w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "I really liked this place and its apple crumble French toast. I used to go there roughly twice a month for the weekend brunch. Food was great, cafe was clean and viable, and service was also fast and good. However, I don't think I am going to visit and order apple crumble French toast in the future. Why? Because of the decrease in portion size of apple crumble French toast by 2/3, while the price stays the same (9.75 as of Feb 2018). Number of toast goes down from 3 to 2, apple slides become much thinner, and the amount of crumbles reduced. I got that the cafe can change the portion size. But it doe s not seem to be fair to decrease the portion without adjusting the price."}, {"review_id": "WBl6JcfTlmK5xumBKW4BoA", "user_id": "Kbz9G5UuXcDDKt7o8mI0nA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/15/2017", "text": "I eat here twice a month as it's right next to my office.  Half of the menu is great and half is monotonous after the first few bites.  The highlights are the smoked trout sandwich, the turkey club when they used to have it, the grilled cheese, and the breakfast potatoes that come with almost everything.  They could improve by cooking the potatoes a little more, getting a liquor license, and by developing a great hamburger (theirs is terrible)."}, {"review_id": "mHzGtNXgqOmMAOXZB-nWEg", "user_id": "Ucm1dGM8_k71gAF-02CHFw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Great place for breakfast, lunch, or weekend brunch.

Soul food at it's best. We had breakfast and it was outstanding. I had salmon corquetts, grits, fried eggs, and biscuits. My wife had the ham and cheese omlete, hash fries, and toast.

I have passed this place many times but the unassuming sign has always lent me to walk past. But inside, it is bright and sunny and was very busy on Friday at lunch. The knock on service was that no one came to the table for waters and to initiate ordering for some time, close to 10 minutes. Granted they were busy, but simple water would have been nice. Of course we ordered a classic breakfast dish: eggs Benedict. The eggs were poached beautifully and the potatoes on the side were seasoned well. We also got the turkey hash, which showcases a kale and feta mix with potatoes and cranberry jelly on the side. A nice intro to fall!I wish the succulents on the wall were real, but the pot and pans repurposed for lighting fixtures are very creative. I will definitely be going back! And hopefully wait only a minute for service."}, {"review_id": "DHRR-H90lzzSGkq8gq7vBw", "user_id": "cf3j3kaHmsqJ3OF6BigbOg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "This is one of my go-to breakfast/lunch/brunch spots in Milwaukee. The wait is generally not too long (usually no more than 1/2 hour), and the food is worth the wait. It's fresh, can be healthy or not depending on your mood, and you get quite healthy portion sizes. To be seated right away, I recommend going before 11am or during the week. Also, their roasted turkey, Brussels sprout, and butternut squash skillet with cheese and eggs (this may change depending on the season), is by far my favorite dish so far."}, {"review_id": "WRcAcJqKZSryY4tGQE9jmg", "user_id": "oNfLGhVXwFQ2KSaOlqywjQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "I don't see what the hype is about. The service was fine and the food was... fine. Nothing special at all. In fact, boring was what we called it. We had the mushroom omelette and the corned beef hash... they were fine. There was absolutely zero seasoning in either dishes. Glad we tried it, but probably won't be coming back it was that forgettable."}, {"review_id": "qIvA7SkmiVLhO1NDWV-FnQ", "user_id": "79PMejA4-xLHlYWPIxAZfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "Simple Café has been our Brunch go to for years now! It's a place we always end up going with our friends and family for brunch. Typically they always have a waitlist during weekends and they have an app where u can put yourself in waitlist and can always come back instead of waiting in line.. that's pretty convenient. I absolutely love their Seasonal Frittata which has different veggies based on the season but is served on a green Tortilla with a bit of sour cream. It's super delicious. They have both breakfast and lunch menus (which they serve after a certain amount of time. We have never been there for lunch but I am sure it's excellent as well."}, {"review_id": "PT2ofaNigad8yWtR0OpFjw", "user_id": "XMgSvrWrkuVRua-M2XPRqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/14/2017", "text": "How did I not know about Simple Cafe? Being a city sweller you would think this would be on the welcome to the city handbook!  Located right on Farwell Avenue I literally have been driving by this place for 6 months.Looking for a place in the city to have breakfast I hit my YELP app and as usual my fellow yelpers did not let me down.   I also love that they have plenty of parking which can be a huge negative when driving to any restaurant in the city.  Friendly hostess seated us quickly and coffee IV drip started almost immediately.  Hubby and I liked the atmosphere, which is kind of boutique cafe.  I ordered the Seasonal Harvest Frittata(Sweet potato, Swiss chard & kale, caramelized onion, roasted red pepper, roasted tomato and zucchini topped with goat cheese, salsa and avocado) and it was one of the best I have had in a LONG time!  Sometimes places fail to cook the veggies long enough so they are hard or too long and they are mushy- Simple Cafe has the consistency perfect!The hubby had the he Apple Crumble French Toast which looked delicious but because I am watching carbs I stayed away or I would have attacked! Seriously though he loved it!  Great friendly service and food came out hot and quick."}, {"review_id": "3MjrYRNP7wHfdTw6YzSxug", "user_id": "NQk9PQ3ynH3xY_0aHdylug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Excellent food and ambience!
