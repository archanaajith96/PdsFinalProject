I loved the chicken so much that I called in an order for 2 thighs the next day - after I tried a new place and had a terrible experience.

On a recent trip home, I vowed to rectify this as I'd intentionally refrained from going to the outposting in LA as I thought I should try the original shop first.Driving by midday on a Saturday, cars were lining the street in front of Gus' and I'd been told that parking around there was tough. So I decided to return later in the day to pick up an order that we'd called in.I got the two piece snack, which was served with white bread, a side of fries, and chocolate chess pie for dessert. The pie was excellent, everything I love about chocolate chess pie was at it's best in this version of it. It was soft, very chocolatey, and the crust flaked beautifully. The chicken, however, wasn't quite what I had imagined. There was no crispness to the skin and the seasonings were subtle. My family was raving about that chicken as soon as we dug in but I wasn't really that impressed. Maybe my expectations were too high? I'm not sure. I plan to try it again to see what I may have missed on my first go round since most people love the food here."}, {"review_id": "eW_a2JuKi7Fz1Ef7F15nCQ", "user_id": "WJR8f_QNG1kuPq5V6RxeFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "As a kid, I would hear others in Louisiana refer to Al Copeland (founder of Popeyes) as the \"fried chicken king\". While there was no official crowning ceremony or announcement, the number of locations were a pretty tell tale sign of his success.The passing of Al and a new generation has created an open seat at the throne and this owner deserves it without a doubt. Being born in a family where you learned to fry chicken right after you were taught to write your name makes for a tough critic. Trust me, the chicken is special! The chicken has a hint of spiciness and is served piping hot. I was less enthused about most of the sides we tried (mac n cheese, fried rice & slaw). But, the potato salad was prepared with mustard, relish and seasoning which I thoroughly enjoyed. If you are a sweet lover and pecan pie fan, you can feast even more. A warm slice of pecan pie which tastes as if it were made by a grandma will put you over the top. .... Hope the IL location is just as good."}, {"review_id": "fiK8YxVR7VlufgQ3HmwSLA", "user_id": "5u8op3jpkU-EzlyzNCPtUg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "So everyone raves about this place and I just don't get it.

Let me just say, the hype is real. Gus's is the best chicken I've ever had, hands down. This place is a dive. It's a super small place, but it serves great food and the location is excellent. Everything we had was awesome! My husband and dad both had mixed chicken baskets, and I had the tenders. The batter is so spicy and just unbelievable. Delicious dipped in ranch with some white bread and a beer to wash it down! The sides were great as well, we loved the beans and Mac and cheese. My only complaint at all (and this isn't Gus's fault!) is the parking. We were meeting family for a reunion and it seriously took me 20 minutes to find a parking spot. And then like another 15 to get a table (this place is busy!) But the food was more than worth it! Can't wait to go back!"}, {"review_id": "iFCgLHIu8zS5jit9OhjKqw", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/9/2018", "text": "What to get: fried chickenService: 5/5Atmosphere: casual sit down, diveyWait: 0 mins (Tuesday 4PM for 1)Parking: Street parking, parking garagesThe Experience:Luckily I have tried a fair number of fried chicken places in Nashville, Louisville, and other cities in the South to compare.This place is within walking distance of Beale St and there are numerous parking garages and lots around. Streets are definitely walkable, even if there is some construction.Since this is the original location, the inside looks kinda like a dimmed, neon-lit dive restaurant. There's still a few diners there at 4PM (I had a late breakfast, so it worked out), but the service here was extremely hospitable and sweet to you. I'm a bit sad I don't recall my server's name, but she checked on me a lot and we got to chat a little about my travels since there weren't many customers around.I'm always scared to try the light meat (breast) in case it's dry, so I always opt for the dark meat if it's my first time. The fried chicken had great flavor and a thin layer of batter, plus a little warmth that creeps up at the end. Not like 'hot chicken' but the spice gives it flavor and dimension. Also crispy enough for my liking.The fried okra was pretty fresh. Not slimy (that's great). The baked beans were fine. I also tried the alcoholic root beer, which was pretty sweet (you don't feel any of the alcohol though). I finished all of this and was completely satisfied and full.If I had to pick one food spot to visit in all of Memphis, Gus' would be my first choice.

He was super sweet, and he was right - it was worth the wait! This chicken is so great - moist, spicy, oh my gosh good. I read someone else'e review saying don't bother with the sides, and I have to disagree, because that may be the best potato salad I've ever eaten.

The sign behind the cashier says today's special Chicken, and that about sums it up. Aside from the chicken, and sweet tea according to my son, there wasn't much else special about the place.There was a 20 minute wait when we arrived around lunch. According to our server a 20 minute wait with the sidewalk and interior filled with people isn't busy.It's a dirty old chicken shack.The people were nice.A family from Missouri specifically the dad made friends with my 3 yr old and they talked and played while we waited on our table. Really nice people. Come to find out when we asked for the check they bought our lunch. Very nice. We thanked them. We knew it was them. Overall we really liked the experience and dirty old shacks that serve good food are my kind of place. The chicken is a 10. It's the crispiest chicken you've ever had. It's mildly spicy super crunch exterior with a juicy center. Dip that in ranch and add a little splash of hot sauce and you're in business. The sides meh. I liked the okra and the fried rice was ok but they weren't good sides. My daughter wanted chicken but I was afraid she wouldn't eat it. So the only non spicy option is the grilled cheese. She had it with Mac and cheese. A 3 yr old spit out the Mac and cheese. You know that's bad. It's that buffet style kind cheap pre-made tastes like lipstick. My son liked his fries and he usually loves beans theirs weren't good. My recommendation would be get an extra piece of chicken and skip the sides. You won't want anything g else when you try the chicken anyway. Glad we tried it. Wouldn't hesitate to go back for chicken alone."}, {"review_id": "hYeSIEccE5dVbIwU7VYtpg", "user_id": "iC-v28LQbh8MybNb_MVKlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Brandy was very welcoming and the food is 5 stars.The chicken had a little spice and a great fried skin.We had the Mac & cheese, greens and slaw just like mom use to make.

Wow, how descriptive is that? How could I possibly bypass the fried chicken after reading that??? It was 3pm, and there was a crowd outside as we approached, and I said outloud, wow a line at 3pm, this must be worth waiting for. We actually ate catfish for lunch, and was picking up takeout for dinner when we got to Tupelo. So I am here to tell you, the chicken was delicious even being reheated. I am not sure what they did to get this chicken a dark reddish brown color, but it was so appetizing looking as well as tasting. It was so savory with crispy skin and chickeny tasting. I ate every little possible morsel off the bones. Yes, it was worthy to be 'famous'. If you are a coleslaw fan, it too was delicious, very simple, crispy crunchy tasty. The baked beans were amaxing, sweetish with a kick. It was nice to have great sides to go with our meal of a half chicken dinner that was enough to share. I would love to find this fried chicken recipe because I live 13 hours away."}, {"review_id": "78lIjeNsdePTYzNPtRLWwQ", "user_id": "oLMVW5sjAoR8yFDDJsROFw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Great food, great environment, great vibe! Gus's was recommended to us as first time visitors to Memphis. We went in on a Friday night around 7pm and it was busy, but not overwhelming where you have to wait for a table! We got seated right away and was offered the menu.Fried chicken was tender, juicy and the spices was just right. Why the 4 stars, you ask? Unfortunately my chicken was a bit cold. I think they tried to make mine before my partner's, and his came out super hot. It took just a bit of the experience away, but nonetheless it was a good meal.Hopefully the temperature issue was just a one-off scenario.

I love Gus's Fried Chicken and if I must be snowed in having that hot, crispy chicken would make it all the better- So I made the call and order to go over the phone- took about 2 mins then the cashier said it should take about 15/20 minutes to complete the order. Awesomeness!! My order was (3) wings, REAL baked beans, Turnip Greens. Also I did order a side of Fried Green Tomatoes which have always been my favorite - The meal was exactly what I wanted and I expect nothing less from Gus's! I'm thrilled that Gus's Fried Chicken is open during this winters mix. Applauding all of their efforts to continuing to produce fresh, hot and crispy chicken. Sorry no photo for this meal- I ended it eating it before I even thought about snapping a picture of it!
