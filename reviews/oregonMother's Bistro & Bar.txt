What a nice restaurant! My hotel was 5 min away and 2 out 2 days of my stay I had my breakfast in this charming place. I was visiting Portland for the weekend and of course the line of people was huge! The wait time was 1 hour on Saturday and 1 and 15 min on Sunday. Well, I tell this much - IT IS WORTH TO WAIT EVEN 2 HOURS! I was pretty skeptical about going for breakfast on Saturday because my flight was too early from LA and I had not had a good breakfast. However, I decided to wait an hour. The food was delicious! I tried Chopped Liver from Lunch menu and it was the best liver I have ever tried! They have a full bar and mimosa was a great add-on thing! After a great welcome breakfast, my breakfast next morning was at Mothers Bistro as well along with Mimosa, Chopped Liver and I tried Fried Ravioli from lunch menu. It was best start of the day!I would recommend this place to anyone especially if you stay in Portland downtown by the waterfront park."}, {"review_id": "rdFLSIfcZWxJV1zGFoTJbQ", "user_id": "0YEcvhgtpPpE_dmmkRx9rA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Although this restaurant does have good reviews and I wanted to give it a good rating; I cannot because I got food poisoning from this place.My boyfriend and I went to Mother's on our vacation to Portland for brunch. There was a bit of a wait, but that was fine. We ordered an omelette with a side of pork sausage links and biscuits and gravy (gravy made from pork sausage) and bacon.After I completed my biscuits and gravy, I tried one of the pork sausage links. After I bit into it I noticed that it had raw meat on the inside. It was raw on the perimeter. I pointed this out to the waiter and he said that that particular sausage is known to have a pink perimeter and that all their meats were cooked to temperature. He offered to give me replacement sausages as compensation. I politely declined because I did not want to receive any more raw or pink sausages. I understand that cooking to temperature is usually a safe bet. But, I cannot be sure that this was cooked to temperature. And even if it was it was still raw. Later that day I felt queasy and then subsequently threw up all of the biscuits and gravy. Then I realized that there was the same pork sausage in my biscuits in gravy but it was covered up by the gravy so I didn't see that it was raw. The reason I was upset is because we were not provided a solution to what looked like raw sausage. The waiter expressed that they get that complaint a lot. I feel if you get a complaint frequently, especially about a pork product, you should address it. We were not offered to take that portion of the meal off of our bill. I wanted to like Mother's because overall the place seemed great and it had a lot of great reviews and awards. However, I have to give this place a one star because of the food poisoning, the generalization of how that particular sausage is \"supposed to be pink\" and the lack of compensation after my complaint."}, {"review_id": "-wyAu2Si7tgjsCQ3st4p4g", "user_id": "i1WskKmeHpcuJw6JBWGtCg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Been here in Portland two times and each time I cam here for Brunch. This place is pretty big and spacious, nicely decorated with plenty of mirrors and chandeliers that make this place hundred times brighter and bigger. Wait time, however, can be a big headache. Each time we waited for more than 45 minutes. I do not know if it is worth such a long wait, But the weather was so cold in our last visit that I think our brain as well as our limbs were numbed a little.The service is impeccable, they are polite, nice and fast. I have had the crab eggs benedict and the salmon hash wit poached eggs ( you can order eggs however you like them). They have both been good. Tried a little of the 'huevos rancheros' and liked that one too. Overall, it is a pretty legit brunch spot. The wait can drive you crazy, but the food is good."}, {"review_id": "uPVb9uUh2kmgzJ8zoQp4MA", "user_id": "3gVtNG4J3TbO02FdxUxIPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Love this spot. My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast. It was really busy on a Friday morning but we were seated quickly. The restaurant is really cute with many different rooms, almost like a large house. All of the service was really friendly. Our waiter was helpful in showing us around the menu and giving us recommendations. They had quite a few vegan options and he made it easy to make what I wanted vegan. I got the tofu scramble and it was the best tofu scramble I have ever had. My boyfriend got a scramble also and he was really impressed. I highly recommend, I think we will go back while we are still out here."}, {"review_id": "WyjD_8Qn5_RW07_cltsOdw", "user_id": "QmdNmPTXeyrzJBKmau-3sg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "My friend insisted we go there prior to our business lunch, as she stated their biscuits and gravy was the \"best in the world\".

This place is it!!!This was the first place I came across while searching for breakfast/ brunch spots for my weekend in Portland. I was beyond impressed with the stature of service, the quality of food, and the amazing restaurant ambiance! I can't say a single bad thing about this place and the half hour wait was more than worth it. We started with their signature cinnamon roll and a half order of the crunchy French toast- both of which exceeded my expectations but the cinnamon roll OMG it was everyyything I could ever dream of like the best I'd ever had easillllly! Not only was it huge it was perfectly sweet and not overbearing at all. Next we ordered the salmon hash and the Greek frittata- I had the hash and it was absolutely delicious! The portions are generous and will definitely fill you up too. Also, the owner, who is also the working Chef at Mother's was doing table touches throughout the restaurant. Excellent service to say the least- highly recommend this place!"}, {"review_id": "deSQzwidsJGdOv54AUBsvw", "user_id": "1Vt3c4Bq3pxs6Puwa_f2uw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Stopped by mothers bistro & bar for breakfast as our first stop in Portland because of the great reviews. There were about 3 people ahead of us when we arrived but it only took about 5-8 minutes for a table to be set up and for us to be called in. Our server Howard was super kind and very helpful. He recommended all the popular dishes and had a great attitude! I ended up getting the Belgian waffle (7.95$) with an add on of whip cream (1.95$) & bananas (1.95$). People weren't kidding when they said the whip cream was amazing. So soft and tasty, MMMM. The waffle itself was super soft and just amazing. You have to taste it for yourself. One friend got the salmon hash as well as the buttermilk pancakes, and the other friend got the mushroom scramble. All were good as well! Everything was highly recommended. Service was amazing from start to finish! Great food, average prices, loved everything !!! Highly recommended. 5/5 for sure.

I ordered the wild salmon hash and my husband got the Mike's scramble, and both were great, even if the side of potatoes that came with the scramble was forgettable. The cream in the salmon hash takes off some of the pungency that can come with eating fish so early in the morning; the dish wasn't fishy at all.My husband also got a glass of the \"fresh squeezed\" grapefruit since he loves all things sour, especially first thing in the morning, but after sipping his juice, we both think it was grapefruit concentrate in disguise. Possibly the juicer machine wasn't working that morning?The decor inside of Mother's reminds me of being in, well, your mom's old parlor room. Gaudy, vintage looking wallpaper and cushioned armchairs abound, and it adds to the charm of the place. do still prefer New American for brunch, just because I feel like it keeps things interesting."}, {"review_id": "yIiQjgWXConqTogF7f8_iQ", "user_id": "tfb1Sw_C9PH6oOhAbMarDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "Came here on a Saturday morning for breakfast and it was pretty busy but we didn't wait that long.

I love brunch and have tried a bunch of places in LA, and this ranks pretty high on my list.The wait can be pretty long, so I suggest making reservations or arriving early. I tried calling 2 days beforehand to make a reservation, but they were already booked that day. So, my friend and I just did a walk-in on a Saturday morning around 9am and the wait was 30 minutes. The good thing is you just leave your number and they'll text you when your table is ready. So my friend and I just went to Stumptown and got some coffee while we waited, so the wait wasn't too unbearable.I absolutely loved the decor of the place. It was super classy with gorgeous chandeliers everywhere, lots of natural light coming in from the huge windows, and a nice homey feel.We ordered the Wild Salmon Hash and the Crunchy French Toast because that's what a lot of people on Yelp recommended, and we were not disappointed! The hash had a good amount of salmon and wasn't too heavy. The french toast was nice & fluffy on the inside with an added crunch on the outside. I've had a crunchy french toast from Blu Jam Cafe in LA, and I definitely liked this one at Mother's better.We surprisingly finished all of our food and were very full & content by the end of it!"}, {"review_id": "wHyUk3DN-hxY7Re8SwEk4A", "user_id": "4llwVVDnBkjDFx_3tHhLiw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "6th stop on my 2018 PDX Take Out Grilled Chicken Sandwich Throw Down.

I would drive to Portland just to eat the \"Benny's Chicken\" sandwich. I didn't think the tortilla strips added much but it didn't detract either like French fries sometimes do when randomly added to sandwiches. I am sorry my picture doesn't do justice to the sandwich. It was beautiful until my wife scarfed 75% of it on the way home. Nom, nom, nom... ha ha.. so good. I have four more sandwiches to try but it wouldn't surprise me if this ended up in the top position.

Biscuits were nice and toasty and the egg was cooked to perfection!    Side of roasted potatoes were seasoned well and had a little brunch to em. Side of fruit - yummy and delicious, can't mess up this hahaBiscuit - sad the bread wasn't served warm and the butter on the side didn't taste like real butter to me DRINKS Strawberry kiwi tea - thought the tea was unique, full of flavor and you can taste the fruits!! Overall I felt like all the hype from the reviews made me have high expectations, sad to say this was a let down for me.
