I was greeted by a lovely young lady who escorted me to my seat. The decor and ambiance was very pleasing.  The seating was comfortable. For an appetizer, I ordered a bowl of the egg drop soup. It was delicious, however, it could have used a splash of soy sauce, but there was none on the table. Next, I had an order of Little Steamed Bun. These little guys were outrageous. Hot, tender, soft and packed with flavor when dipped into the dipping sauce that accompanied the dish. For my entree, I had the Hunan Beef. I must say I was a bit disappointed with this dish. First, it was small. Next it has some kind of an earthy taste. Difficult to describe.  Not pleasant at all. Perhaps it was just me. Overall, I was pleased with this restaurant. The service was great and I'm certain to return."}, {"review_id": "1oObQ6urZbtbj7bzbui1rg", "user_id": "Ao2VYIw9AMKOTiCUwe_T9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "Huge fan of the lettuce wraps.  Some of the best I've had.  I have also tried the sesame chicken, orange peel chicken and beef w/ broccoli.  All entries were good and were served with white or brown rice.  Prices are reasonable and portions are great.  Restaurant was clean and service was attentive."}, {"review_id": "CKcPq_IhM7YennpYqlTDrQ", "user_id": "3TJcP0stfxjWGsLuGQgQdg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/3/2017", "text": "We decided to go to Red Lantern after finding them on another app for gluten free friendly restaurants. After looking at their gluten free menu online I was intrigued and insisted we went. We decided we were going to order to go and the lady manning the cash register was really helpful when it came to answering my questions on how they prepare there dishes. She also went back and checked to make sure everything I was ordering was dairy free as well. Below is what we decided to order:Egg Drop Soup (GF) $3.25 - This came in an entire quart container to go filled with loads of broth, veggies, chicken, and egg. This was ok and a nice starter to my meal. I enjoyed that I was actually able to get soup out at a Chinese restaurant.Jade Green (GF) $9.95 - This was a vegetable dish of snow peas, green beans, broccoli, and onion. It was in a form of brown sauce and came with rice on the side. We enjoyed this dish as an additional source of veggies.Mongolian Beef (GF) $12.25 - This dish had an asterisk next to it on the menu to represent it being spicy. I did not feel that it was spicy enough and the sauce reminded me of the same sauce that was on the Jade Green dish. Overall though my bf really enjoyed it since he prefers blander meals and this dish came with rice as well.Chicken Broccoli (GF) $11.25 - This was basically just a dish of chicken breast and broccoli in what tasted like to me the exact same sauce as the other 2 dishes. This dish we enjoyed and it came with rice as well. We chose white rice for all of the dishes, but they did have brown available.This is a great place to go if you have celiac disease. I was informed they do the gluten free dishes in separate pans, but always make sure to double check on this if you decide to go because that could change at any time. The only thing I wish a Chinese restaurant could do was provide more variety when it comes to their sauces."}, {"review_id": "OgCz3OuaFC7UHh1Z3caToQ", "user_id": "LBTxXX-qj7euq87_b9-vjg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "CONFESSION: I rarely get desert.

Has anyone ever had orange steak?? I mean we've all had orange chicken but orange steak takes it to a whole other level!First off, this place is located in the spot that it's hard to see from the road. So drive to the back where that nasty Granite City restaurant is and the restaurant is back there in another building. This place is very nice inside. Is definitely more upscale but the prices are not ridiculous. Our server was amazing she was very nice and always checked up on us without being annoying. First we order potstickers which I have say are one of the best potstickers I have tasted and if you know me I usually have potstickers about once a week because I eat Chinese all the time. The dipping sauce for the potstickers was sooooo good! That stuff is like crack.. The classic chicken fried rice did not disappoint. It was full of flavor. What we did was order the chicken fried rice and orange steak together and into shared it. It all tastes very good together. You know the food is great when you don't have to ask for the soy sauce. I highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back!!"}, {"review_id": "2JOvowv9Dy3ztUubvXohow", "user_id": "Pbu3PwrMmoPk2dL95y2BiQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "We absolutely love this place!

Everything is executed perfectly every time. Their lunch specials are such a deal. We've even gotten takeout, and it's been perfect each time. By far the highest quality Chinese in the area. The service is always great as well. The servers are friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and extremely attentive.

Hostess was very welcoming. I liked the decor. Kind of a modern eclectic sort of woody feel. Things sort of blended here from one area to the next. Nice bar off to the side w/ several  flat screen tvs, multiple stools, looked like premium liquor, a smiling bartender and customers actually sitting there! Much better than the usual obligatory bar w/ 2 stools, no bartender, or a frowning one, no tv , newspapers in Chinese laying on it looking like no customers had sat their in yrs! This was way better. Our waitress seated us and I really liked the high back leather chairs at all the tables. Per some Yelpy review suggestions I ordered the Orange Steak ( never seen it or heard of it before but go with the Yelp vibe,right??) and my friend ordered the kung pao chicken. I ordered tea and received jasmine tea which was a surprise as Im used to oolong or black tea but it was delicious, ( Ive had it before but not for a long while) & complimented the meal well. Restaurant had some patrons in it at 7pm on a weeknight and noise was at a conversation level but not pin drop quiet . Potstickers came out along w/soup. potstickers were actually cooked just a touch less than what im used to & that was an improvement. Usually they hv a bit of a crunch and the inside is slightly done. This potsticker was soft but done(still needed a knife) inside was wonderful and the poi sauce to dip it in,had something else added to make it more enjoyable. (Green onion & mystery additive) Couldnt identify but it was great! I didnt hv soup but my friend enjoyed his egg drop.  Orange steak came out and WOW! It must hv been dipped in a tiny bit of batter, quick panfried and dipped in an orange glaze while hot resulting in a slight crunch, slight chew and was phenomenal! The orange glaze was not overly sweet , like a sweet an sour sauce but slightly sweet w/ more depth to it. The dish also had several vegetables which seemed blanched, a nice touch and they were crunchy but not over done. My friend was pleased w/ his Kung Pao chicken but he had been here before and was expecting such. Service was good, they also had the busboys on their toes. Following up to wipe down tables and place new settings there. I liked the efficiency that they use at this place. Their workers are always smiling at each other and the customers as well. The prices are several bucks higher for most dishes but taste, service, presentation and cleanliness are worth it. My only negative was the surprise of being charged $3.50 for a pot of jasmine tea. Most pots of tea are $1 or complimentary.But thats it, If I lived  in quad cities Id frequent often. Oh parking is tight too as they are in a strip mall with many other businesses but don't let that deter you. Id go at off hours cause they likely get very busy but do go here!"}, {"review_id": "J49VAm_HJ7jrUy6sTT6c2g", "user_id": "LFTH-Z9kGa7JSjSaixNd-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/25/2016", "text": "Hanging around movie theater while my RV is getting repaired. Lunch time so I decided to try the Red Lantern for Chinese Food. I'm from Seattle and my pallet appreciates the wonderful Chinese cuisine that is found there.

While I agree the food is a cut above most Chinese restaurants in the QC's, it's the attitude and service of the staff that prompts me now never to come back! THEY. ARE. AWEFUL and ARROGANT.  Today we ordered shrimp with eggplant and found no eggplant at all. We were charged for \"Shrimp Hunan Style\".  We asked for Jasmine tea and got something that tasted like a cheap herbal concoction.  We asked about the tea. The smug hostess told us \"we only have 1kind of tea. Nevertheless, we were charged on the bill 3.25 for \"Jasmine tea.\"  Are you guys incompetent or just plain disrespectful liars. Everything I've ever experienced here every time I visit gives the attitude that you believe \"there's a sucker born every minute\" or that you expect the customers to come in sit down order eat whatever's input in front of us and shut up. I know that's how things work in China were customer service and hospitality don't exist. But this ain't China and you are giving Chinese people and Chinese businesses in America a bad name with such terrible service and \"don't give a shit\" attitudes."}, {"review_id": "Z58qQduC8yfoxBr8OiaseQ", "user_id": "r2eO_RwGg6XYjcy9I_7W2A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/6/2017", "text": "Nice clean place with a good atmosphere but the prices are too high for what you get.
