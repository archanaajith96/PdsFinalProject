We wanted something traditional,authentic and different.. This place was incredible. Now let's talk about how 9 people were fed and everything we ordered,We all shared. I took the initiative to order for all of us. Lebanese breakfast usually includes tea, yes make sure your table gets this. Next was labne a thick yogurt cheese spread topped with olive oil and eaten with pita bread. Makenek with eggs, it's a Lebanese sausage.Foul or foule: I do not know the correct spelling but this is a must try, it's cooked fava beans served with oil, cumin,  with chopped parsley, garlic, onion, lemon juice,It is notably a staple food in the middle East and everyone eats it for breakfast with pita bread.Fatteh:is another traditional dish with fried pita bread, yogurt and garbanzo beans topped with olive oil and it was delightful. Also the cheese flatbread and tbyme flatbread is a must have. It was cut into fours and great for sharing.. Overall it's a nice place small not fancy but boy they can feed you well and the prices were so reasonable Service: was really slow but it didn't matterCoffee: awful so stick with tea, or get the turkish coffee it's very similar to espresso"}, {"review_id": "E4n5xjWibcnKVsQkLLLznA", "user_id": "OoJ2wI22W640wkNJL3bMLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Quality middle eastern food at a reasonable price. It is a large portion of food for the price. The meats are marinated well and cooked with the perfect amount of char. The staff including the owner was wonderful in making sure everything was okay while we waited for the food and made sure that the food was prepared and presented well. It is that attention to detail for the customers that sets this place apart from others. I didn't get a chance to try their baklava (which is one of my favorite sweet desserts) but it was pleasing to eye when I saw the table nearby having it."}, {"review_id": "4lB_VtmOom7_9sZEhhO2gw", "user_id": "8Q1T4OR4R-MIJvuSXU8x1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "The chicken ka bob was da bomb.

I was a little hungry and trying not to make that stop at McDonalds and will have to say that I was very surprised. Lady on the counter was very friendly and happy to explain what some of their menu items consisted of. I ended up getting the shawarma sandwich and it was actually very good. I found it to be simple yet very tasteful and not dry like I have found it at other places. The menu was not under or over priced so that is always a plus, not to mention the friendly service provided. ( I am sorry but I have lived in that area a long time and always come across rude service when eating around there..lol) Definitely recommend making this a stop, even if it's just once to try.

We came in for lunch and were quickly seated to a table. Side note: while this restaurant may be on the smaller side, it has plenty of seating without feeling cramped.For starters you are greeted with some complimentary pickles and olives, yum. We also treated ourselves to homemade hummus, pita bread, a cheese pie and meat pie to start (forgive me because I don't know the proper names of these \"pie\" dishes). The homemade hummus was out of this world. Accompanied with the fresh (generous portion) of pita bread, an excellent start to our meal. The cheese and meat \"pies\" were served on a thin bread and both were tasty (although I preferred the meat pie over the cheese). We also got a parsley salad with finely diced tomatoes and onions, I think the proper name is \"Tabbouli\" salad. I've never had a salad like this one before but I definitely thought it was good and also healthy, which is always a plus! I would definitely say give this a try.On to my main dish, which was my favorite part of my meal, a lamb gyro. Holy cow, this had to of been the BEST gyro I've ever had (and I've had my fair share of gyros). There was a perfect meat to sauce ratio, it was a very generous portion. The size of it was perfect as well, it wasn't overbearingly big where it falls apart in your hand but it also was plentiful. I would absolutely suggest trying this during your visit. Overall my experience was pretty much perfect. In addition to the excellent food, the owner, Eli, was very personable and friendly. I would definitely come back here and if you're in the area, do not pass this place up!"}, {"review_id": "dhkO_Kcj_uLGS-u8PNhyjQ", "user_id": "OUD1t1__WFnaodS4y6o28g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/9/2016", "text": "I'm not sure if my expectations for shawarma and hummus with meat are high, but I have yet not been able to find a place that is really good!!

The house vegetarian mezza included the freshest tabouli we've had anywhere in years as well as solid humus and babaganouj and three pieces of falafel. Fried cheese boraks were as expected, but we were surprised that the greens in the nicely formed mini spinach pies tasted like they'd been pickled. The lamb, beef and chicken in the house meat platter were consistently moist, but minimally spiced, and came with rice (or alternatively fries), but no vegetable beyond some raw onion sprinkled with parsley. Service was friendly.
