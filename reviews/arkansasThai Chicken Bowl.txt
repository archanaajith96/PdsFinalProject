The owner is such a pleasant guy and always goes out of his way to throw in something extra, or ensure that his guests are well taken care of/well fed! My favorite item is the pineapple fried rice- I've never had anything like it before! It's out of this world! The green curry is awesome too and I'm not usually that into curry but my boyfriend gets it here all the time. So many great vegetarian options, options if you're into really spicy or not at all... There are plenty of decent Thai restaurants in fort smith but this one surpasses them all in my book"}, {"review_id": "iBxBsdx9Ds-0-yWQWG97CQ", "user_id": "ts5o422B9oxWpwnXpYipzA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "Nice hole in the wall Thai place.

Enjoyed supporting his business for two days.  One critique is for the peanut sauce that comes with spring rolls.

My group tried the egg rolls, salad and 4 different dishes. All of them were excellent. The four dishes ranked in order of taste from good to best:4. The pineapple cashew chicken was very good. My favorite part was the pineapple as it made the dish a little sweeter and was the strongest flavor wise. 3. The garlic chicken was really good, and definitely had a better and stronger flavor than most dishes I have tried at other restaurants. 2. The yellow shrimp curry was very good. The dish had 9 pieces of shrimp and a very strong curry flavor. It was very well seasoned. 1. The savory brown rice was the favorite of the group. It was a large portion and very well balanced. It was sweet but not overwhelmingly sweet. It had a lot of chicken and vegetables. I would definitely recommend. The egg rolls were delicious and very well priced for the potion size (6 rolls). The meals came with a salad as an appetizer, and it was really good but heavy on the dressing. I think it was a mayonnaise base? The rice on the side came in the shape of a star which was very cute. Overall this is an AWESOME place to eat if you want great food and even better customer service. You can tell the owner genuinely loves his job!"}, {"review_id": "Kbn0elVEgnFfv0FvwR7p9g", "user_id": "2Z8xkX67AVRvfb2zCbAlEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "This little hole in the wall is fantastic!
