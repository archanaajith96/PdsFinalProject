There's so much natural light and beautiful plants, so it feels really airy and relaxing in there as you're eating lunch. You can also grab Buddy Brew coffee at the little bar there, which I love.I'm a huge Eggs Benedict fan, and theirs is probably my favorite. It's a griddled biscuit with bacon jam and cheddar fondue. Plus the packed egg and micro greens on top. And their crispy potatoes won my heart right away! Just a warning, if you order their Simple Breakfast Sandwich, it's just that - very simple. It's definitely the choice for someone who prefers something plain. I think that's implied and is a great option in case you have a friend who isn't very adventurous when it comes to food.There's a pretty large shop in the building as well, but to be honest, everything is extremely overpriced. But I don't go for the shopping, I go to enjoy an amazing meal. And the food will never disappoint."}, {"review_id": "uaqM7uUEw_vC2XSEb49uQA", "user_id": "nWRDqA-XXdju1jOMnN7QcA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Food feels overhyped (above average), not to the point their creations will have me coming back for more, but would like to try their brunch (heard great things) though! It's still worth a visit to see the interior, which is magical and unique. There's a staircase with portraits on the wall, which is one of my favorite spots & reminds me to slow down and take in the beauty around me and feels calming!I really love the outdoor seating at Oxford Exchange with a fountain and an atrium along with potted succulents; This is definitely where you want to grab a seat, especially love lots of sunlight streaming in!OE RUEBEN 3.5/5: Their house made roasted corned beef (not fatty & soft) made with lighter seasonings and not salty with purple cabbage, but prefer traditional Rueben w/sauerkraut. Of course, had to order side of sweet potatoe fries (no upcharge); Fried right amount of time (highly recommend) with crunch in each bite. For $20 with tip, it was more than I wanted to spend, but it is a trendy place, so keep an open mind! FRIED BRUSSEL SPROUTS 3.5/5: Exterior fried, so it was flaking off with a soft center, something different and demolished quickly!FRIED AVOCADO WEDGES 3.5/5: Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. This is doctored up with sprinkles of baby micro cilantro greens on and Sambol sour cream. I liked trying something new! The tea bar is the place I'd definitely frequent. I really love how fragrant all the different varieties of tea mixes together & as you're walking by, so easy to be entranced by it and pulled in; It's a heavenly smell and I'm a huggge tea lover, so my favorite part of Oxford Exchange is definitely Tebella!"}, {"review_id": "FM-E3z-wg7eyDVWsPo5bbQ", "user_id": "y3IKaja8EOxWqYMoRLoYuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I've been eyeing this place for a while now. I had no idea it existed prior to Yelp and viewing unique Florida destinations. Oxford Exchange is directly across from the main entrance to UT where there is barely any parking. Luckily, the TGH clinic gate was open  on South Magnolia Ave and had a sign that said free parking for Oxford Exchange. This maybe only a weekend thing as I visited on a Saturday afternoon. It's also important to note TGH has armed security at the gate to keep an eye on your car.After walking a block, I checked in with the restaurant and was told an hour and a half wait. I told them I wasnt interested and decided to get carrot cake tea from the tea bar instead. Afterwards, I checked back in with the hostess who said times constantly change and it was only an hour wait now. We browsed the book area where you get a free mystery book with any purchase. The mystery books are wrapped in tissue paper with a small label describing what the book is about.The restuarant routinely changes it's menu (average dish $14) but serves brunch all day on the weekends. Everything leaving the kitchen looks amazing btw. While eating my delicious chocolate chip pancakes and feeling like I was at an upsale spot on an episode of The Hills. I asked my waiter what the stand alone bar was in the middle of the courtyard. He said it was a traveling Oyster Bar that was there on the weekends only. Oysters were about $3 a piece and served raw.After finishing my meal and looking around I realized there were 90% women at Oxford ;) Every young coffee loving, booking reading, sun dress wearing Tampa girl was here. Oxford wasnt quite what I thought it'd be, I pictured a huge elegent book store and coffee shop with couches and large bay windows like an elegent barnes and noble minus the bs. Oxford is split into different small sections selling various upscale luxury items (books, sunglasses, coffees, teas, soaps, furnishings) with the restaurant portion of the building taking up the largest space and no public access on the 2nd floor. I thought this place was still pretty cool despite it not being entirely what I thought it was. If I was a UT student I'd probably be here all the time but still cant afford the $95 price tag for a coffee table picture book or $21 pencil set."}, {"review_id": "nFrTCLOq6Gplc_FIKBXb4Q", "user_id": "IB6n1P091RhK__FU2XIFgw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Let me preface this by saying I'm a huge book nerd. I like hard copies and don't own a kindle or nook. When I found out there was a restaurant that also sold books I knew I had to go! The interior is jut beautiful! Exactly what I imagined in my mind when thinking about going there. I ordered a cold matcha lavender tea, which came in a big size for a reasonable price. Best tea I've had! My husband had coffee Nd really enjoyed that too. The gift store and book store were fun to look in. My husband is a photographer and he was really enjoying the interior decorating and the architecture. There was a chic, library/industrial vibe that I really enjoyed. We are planning to go back to enjoy some food because we have heard such good things. I'll update the review once we do.

It is quiet yet bustling at times, it is beautiful and totally relaxing. They have benches upstairs too where you can sit & relax. It's a great way to just take a load off and enjoy some tasty cold brew or espresso from Buddy Brew.The layout of the building is gorgeous. The bathrooms are always super clean and you feel like you're at a fancy hotel. I would love to visit the restaurant in Oxford Exchange sometime soon! The bookstore at the front has some interesting books to look at - they have some classics (like Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility) with these awesome leather bindings. They make great gifts for friends who love to read! All in all, I really wish I could live closer cause I would be at Oxford Exchange probably every weekend. It's a great place to meet up with friends or just to go and study all by yourself."}, {"review_id": "B1pKvJgU8mZzg4V-on3g5A", "user_id": "70owtRdRpBTJ9cRKDohg8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Overview:No wifiMake a resyGreat atmosphereI was in Tampa for work and ended up coming here twice.

Figured all the reviews could not be wrong? Well after paying for parking $10. In a lot across the street they lose one star as what no parking for your patrons? We enter this establishment. Than the confusion really begins first you walk through a book store? That leads into a coffee bar? Tea shop?  Long line back corner where 35% of the real estate is dedicated to a restaurant. Decor looked nice but packed with diners. So the host at the entrance says to me how many?I say two he says two and half hours? Excuse me am I in the twilight zone. Also he was a bit pompous I would have accepted it better if we started out do you have a reservation? Makes more logical sense. I didn't know Tampa has such arrogance I won't return here. This place only made me miss home in South Florida where thankfully the South Beach-Ft. Lauderdale's upscale restaurants are far more welcoming as well as have their act together. You have people waiting but don't dedicate more space to eating?

I personally went with the omelet with spinach, tomato, bacon, and goat cheese($13). The goat cheese was the perfect touch. Drinks range $10-12 so not happy hour prices but not too bad. They also have a lot of Gluten Free options. After brunch we snapped a couple pics on the world famous staircase. The perfect place for a photo opt.

We both had coffee -- yay freshly brewed and strong coffee! Our server Nikolas was so attentive that he really made our breakfast feel special.  I had the chorizo eggs benedict and my bf had the burger.  My eggs bennie were super good and flavorful but let me tell you, that burger looked out of this work.  If and when we go back, I cannot wait to try the other brunch items.  I've heard nothing but glowing reviews about OE and I am fully committed to supplementing my review with a complete assessment of each item :)"}, {"review_id": "0yAzMPRfs_bqJe3u_aJqAQ", "user_id": "UvSOYVwqwyzNr40AU1t6Yw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "I feel like I'm in the middle of Washington DC. Love it The entire building brings me back to my NYC childhood train station, there's even a real shoe shiner in the middle of the hallway The restaurant main area is noisy. It echoes so if you have hearing challenges, can be annoying . Ask to sit in the outside atrium. The kitchen shares the main dining area as well so that doesn't help with the acoustics but does add synergy to the atmosphere Had to wait awhile to be seated although I had reservations. Had to get up and ask for attention at the MD front desk, not cool. Once it cane, all was goodMenu is limited and mixed with creative selections that are also seasonal. I had the vegetarian chili, excellent with a side of fries. Watched intently as large salads went by me and sandwiches were being served next to me. SemiThey have tables and semi booths, many are too close for comfort for this American. You def hear conversations even with the high noise level Would return, breakfast is big here tho there were mixed reviews on the brunchDef not cheap but worth an experience. You get the eclectic bookstore, gift shop, and an optical office and store in the opposite end of the building. A second level balcony perfect for reading privacy.Easy find on a Main Street, brick walls outside of white and oil like lanterns.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and give great suggestions. The stores in the building are really cute and fun to browse through while you wait for a table. I got the Earl Grey Lavender Lemonade and it was very refreshing. It did not have a strong lavender taste to it, which is good as I am not a huge fan of lavender. I liked the mixture of the tea and lemonade-- the tea was brewed well and the lemonade was not too sour. For the meal, I got the black bean burger, with tomato, which the waiter recommended. I was glad that I got the tomato as the burger was dry and the tomato added some moisture to the dish. I love the bun, it was soft but did not get soggy and the crispy onions added a nice crunch to the burger. I also got sweet potatoes fries with the burger. I generally don't like sweet potato fries but I love the ones at Oxford. I like the contrast of the seasoning and the sweetness of the fries. Finally, the restaurant can be a little pricey, but the quantities are more than enough.

First off, the staff is fantastic! Anywhere from the restaurant to the bookstore in the back or upstairs where the executive offices are the employees are all so welcoming & friendly. Second, the atmosphere and ambiance is very classy & relaxing. I like to think that it is quite upscale, yet not in a \"I'm too good for you\" kind of way. Lastly, the food is AMAZING and although the price may seem steep for a college student as myself, I wouldn't say it's overpriced because you do get good quality food & service. Now, obviously, not everything is entirely perfect. OE does have some flaws, such as parking always being a struggle and it being constantly busy and overpacked (especially on the weekends) you will be waiting to be seated and that may take a very long time. However they do have a large sort-of waiting area and a shopping area in the front and back ends.

There was also an Anthropologie-esque retail area with candles, fun trinkets, pretty coffee table books and more. We had brunch in the restaurant which was very buzzy and had a great atmosphere. A lot of the reviews say it's \"classy\" but attire at brunch runs the gamut- were dressed in yoga pants and there were other people dressed casually as well as women in dresses.

Expertly designed rooms depict class and quality. From the vaulted open window ceilings in the atrium, to the wood paneling with presidential portraits on the staircase, Oxford Exchange is classy. We typically enjoy Sunday Brunch here and some items are a great value. I recommend the omelet it includes the crisp breakfast potatoes, toast, and homemade jam for $13. The French toast and the seasonal pancakes are the best in town. If you order off of the lunch menu, I recommend the club sandwich or the chicken burger both times are generously portioned and are worth $15. Steven the general manager is always hospitable and most of the staff offer excellent service. If you are near University of Tampa or in the downtown area this establishment is the very best around."}, {"review_id": "pOemXDtwQPCCiFx0DUgkkg", "user_id": "C_-Hu-1liU4kOTrBusP69A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "Walking into Oxford Exchange, I feel like I am transported to London. The decor is absolutely gorgeous, and the concept is very unique-- I have never seen anything like it in Florida. Inside, there is a boutique with gifts and candles, an Aesop shop, a Warby Parker shop, a bookstore, a Buddy Brew Coffee shop, and the best brunch spot in Tampa. I try to come here every time I visit from Miami.The brunch at OE is incredible. I usually eat family-style so I can try as many things as possible in one shot. My favorite brunch dish is their Chorizo Eggs Benedict, which has a bit of a spicy kick. The poached eggs are always done to perfection--never overcooked, and the potatoes that accompany the dish are the perfect mix between a home-fry and a crispy french fry. The avocado wedges are also delicious. The avocados are panko-crusted, fried, and served with lime, cilantro, and a delicious sauce to keep the flavors fresh and clean. Although its a bit pricey, many dishes, such as the pancakes and the steak salad are very generous portions, and the quality of all the food is worth the price. As a coffee addict, I love that the OE brunch has a whole menu of coffee/tea drinks! It has everything from specialty teas to matcha lemonade to seasonally-flavored lattes. Their pumpkin spice latte and caramel lattes are delicious--and still taste like coffee, not sugared milk!Like the rest of Oxford Exchange, the ambiance of the restaurant is very London-esque. There is moderate noise if you're in the main dining room, but it is a popular place, so what else would you expect. I would highly recommend calling ahead to make a reservation and request to sit in the atrium. The natural light, plants, and fountain in the middle make you feel like you're sitting outside, but you don't have to deal with the heat or mosquitoes. It's a beautiful setting.  Finally, the service here is great. The staff is professional and very attentive, without being overbearing. OE is easily my favorite place in Tampa!"}, {"review_id": "amCmOqbr877sQ-R-lNUC-A", "user_id": "IpvssHjj-IH4M5Z7xD1Ucg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "This place is MAGICAL.
