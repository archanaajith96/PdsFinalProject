Their Tom Yum soup is so flavorful & it's probably one of the best Tom Yum I've ever had. I think I've gotten soup from here at least two times a week. The menu isn't overbearing like other Thai restaurants - which is good. The price for lunch and dinner is reasonable. I ordered the vegetable curry lunch special and paid $7.15. Not only was it cheap, it was good portion too. It's definitely a hole in the wall, but so good!"}, {"review_id": "Udy6hMFbNQaFEzVNW75-4g", "user_id": "P9uyTSBl6_H_2gpyb9uqhQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/23/2018", "text": "A \"hole in the wall\" with unexpected flavor! From the outside and even inside this place looks a bit run down but don't let that fool you. The food is better than the exterior visual. Actually I haven't  been back to this place in a while but this time I was going to try their peanut curry combo which comes with rice and a spring roll. The curry was flavorful with strong taste of peanut and coconut milk, not a lot of heat to the curry. An unexpected Thai place to check out in the Warren area."}, {"review_id": "PqmeZGEtb04l81n4qoBYeQ", "user_id": "9EI94e2iuU7-zWxr05eJGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "Okay maybe I've gotten the same dish every time I come here (veg curry with shrimp) so that's all I can base this review on, but the fact that it's always good speaks to the consistency! Not a fan of the hot and sour soup, but that's not something I care about. I'm still glad the meals come with.The spot is tiny and easy to miss, connected to a motel, and has a tiny handwritten sign that just says \"Thai Food.\" Some have said this made them less likely to come, but this just adds to the charm. The space inside is even smaller than it looks from the outside, so I'd try not to come with a large group or at prime meal times. Service is always friendly, fast, and accurate. I will say though, like all Thai places in my experience, the spice level is pretty inconsistent. I'm okay with anything from not spicy to super spicy, so that doesn't' bother me.In conclusion, if you want a good veg curry, that's not too salty and not too greasy, for a great price, and you're in the area, this is your place."}, {"review_id": "ThXEJClSmilFhKsgcPYp9w", "user_id": "6IRT92XUVNTse1radnnxeg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/27/2016", "text": "Walking in this place looks a little run down but the food makes up for that in every way! There are a variety of lunch specials and combos and the prices are great. Came in for lunch today and had the Peanut Curry Medium spice and it certainly had a nice kick to it. The portion size is large, the flavors were great and the price is right. It gets busy on weekdays since it's right by GM buildings and a shady hotel is next door but don't let that discourage you! It's actually interesting to people watch who comes out...LOL"}, {"review_id": "uAYVSSR9XXMOZndfdqPxBg", "user_id": "vj3Dgahg9GngeK6G7KkZGw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/16/2017", "text": "Drove past this place for 3 years dismissing.

It looks kind of dingy on the outside but the food here is actually pretty good. They have a number of combos/lunch specials on a board and you can order any of them regardless of the day. I ordered the Wednesday combo which was chicken pad Thai with some sort of red curry perhaps? I'm not sure if all lunches come with the sweet and sour soup + egg roll, but the total for the meal was 9.50 with tax which is a great deal for the amount of food you get! I asked for spicy and it looks like the way they make the food spicier is by adding red pepper flakes which is the first time I've seen that at a Thai restaurant. The curry was slightly sweet and was something I liked alot more than the pad Thai. The pad Thai and curry was separated by a line of rice which was a nice way of doing it. Pad Thai itself was pretty solid as well. I'd definitely come back!"}, {"review_id": "DOseza3y8koT9k4CBgTBkg", "user_id": "wsyNoHyWW1z_yIkfPcAyvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/26/2017", "text": "So I usually go to another Thai restaurant a little but closer to my house but they were closed. So came on yelp and found this Thai place. Ordered pad Thai with chicken and fried rice with chicken. Usually combos come with soup and spring roll this came with a spring roll and fried rice.

I pull up and started second thinking it. I walk in the store and instantly there is a horrible horrible smell. Holy cow - what happened. Yikes. I get my carry out and leave. My food was ready on time - positive. I get back to my office and I open it up! Looks good.. I ordered fried rice with shrimp mild. Shrimp tails are still on... wtf... taste - a little too spicy for me considering it was supposed to be mild. Rice was a little hard.. overall it was decent. Good flavor though.
