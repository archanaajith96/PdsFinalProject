Seriously good. It's very hipster-friendly. Simple tables and chairs, community seating at the big tables. Met up with some co-workers here, one of whom knows this place well as the rest of us were from out of town. She did the ordering with some input from us. First we had a salad. It was a kale and lentil salad. I really don't care for kale, and that's not there fault. The seasoning and dressing were delicious though. My suggestion might be that they have more than one salad option a day. I know I'm in the minority of kale lovers, but there has to be others. Say I'm not the ONLY one. Then we had 3 different pizzas, one had arugula on it and was a white pizza. That was very good, with the bit of spiciness from the arugula to the coolness of the white sauce. A great yin-yang type pizza. And yes, the crust is amazing. Then there was a cheeseless pizza. WHAT? Pizza with no cheese? Is that even legal? One of our group requested it and man, it was really good. I don't think I would have ever thought about having pizza without cheese on it, but it worked. The sauce really came through and it wasn't overpowering. Really a great pizza.Our last pizza had meat on it and some sort of sweet and spicy combo thing that really worked. I'm a sucker for contrasting flavors, and this was one of those.  The house red wine was really tasty too and went well with all the pizzas.Side note, or I should maybe have started with this. I heard the server say Frose' and I said, \"yes, please.\" He brought that out first and it was not a drink, it was more like a sorbeto. No problem. I ate it first and enjoyed every bit of it. So delicious!!!! So yes, I ate dessert first. That's just how I roll. Overall it was a very lovely experience."}, {"review_id": "MXsj1Pq5AdU0ZDfpUd02lg", "user_id": "3LxSs_dQ37-LBRz07EDbyg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "This is not your typical pizza place!! A Dopo has fresh ingredients, thin sourdough crusts, and is beyond delicious. Make sure to put in your name early because the wait can be long (grab a beer from Crafty Bastard while you wait), but it's well worth it.Their salads are always new and very tasty (and I'm not usually a salad person). I got the 'nduja & mushrooms pizza based on looks alone & I'm so glad I did! Don't let the mushrooms or the weird title throw you off, it's an excellent & creamy pizza with a little spice. Also got the daily gelato special (thin mint) & it tasted exactly like a girl scout cookie! So good.

Sourdough? Whoever has heard of that before? We came on Cinco de Mayo, and knowing that probably half of the population of Knoxville was out drinking margaritas at Mexican restaurants I had a feeling that there wasn't going to be such a busy crowd. So, as a fellow yelper invited the GF and I out to join her on the festivities, we obliged.What did we order...We got the \"nduja and mushrooms with added pepperoni. Let's just say it was an interesting pizza. The pizza is pretty thin crust, along with a good amount of bubbles within the bread crusted with toasted edges from cooking in the wood fired oven. I've been watching a lot of pizza videos on youtube, and what I learned was that I am in no way an expert at pizzas. For dessert we had to check out their gelato. The GF ordered the pistachio gelato. That was a winner. Whole pistachio hidden inside the gelato, you know that it's legit."}, {"review_id": "1Xa8SrIYUbYtfKAv-CY5hg", "user_id": "dCUCnf8UGcjLe2jSMD90pQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Awesome pizza!!

We came on a Friday at 5:30pm to avoid the wait. There is parking to the side of the restaurant but I'm sure if it was busy you would have to look for parking elsewhere. I noticed there are lots under the highway but I'm not sure if that's free. So what is so different about this pizza? It's the chewy crust I love to consume! It's extremely thin but the crust is spot on. This is what I call pizza. I ordered the beetroot and I was a tad disappointed. I think if it was topped with arugula and had chunks of mozzarella, it would have been perfect. Maybe I should have went with my usual choice of mushrooms? Yes, the beets were a different taste to a pie but the cheese was so melted and watery that I barely tasted it. It was similar in consistency to a watery salsa; when you dip the chip, nothing stays on it but it gets a hint of color from touching the salsa. But I loved this type of dough for pizza so I can't really give it a low rating. I also decided to eat my pie with utensils and that really slowed my pace down. I could have totally downed the pie in a few minutes but with the utensils it took me forever but I definitely appreciated it more. Interior: communal tables, limited tables, they could probably have more seating and make it less spaced out. I love their wall design near the kitchen and the fact that you can see them making the pies. The pistachio gelato bumped this rating a star. It was so good! It had pieces of pistachio and it wasn't sugary sweet. It tasted similar to gelato from Italy! I miss those gelato days. FYI: sparkling water is free. If you like the bubbly nose feeling, order it! I stuck with the free water that came in the fancy wine bottles."}, {"review_id": "7aEaxkrPmDPuT32O9rffYQ", "user_id": "LutWrXrun--zL0nHJnYaLg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2017", "text": "I like thin crust pizza, and I don't like it too crispy.  They make it right here. Well, it was almost right. The white sauce is a bit thin so at the end the crust felt a bit soggy. The thin sauce also watered down some of the flavor. The pistachio gelato is a must have! It's the sole reason I rounded up the rating.

The restaurant is located in an out of the way place, and a little hard to find, but so worth it! The interior is on the small side and the industrial like decor gives it more of an urban like feel. I loved that our appetizer plates were mismatched pieces of old china.  Speaking of appetizers......the mushroom cashew Pate was delicious served with warm pieces of focaccia bread. The kale salad had roasted veggies and lentils on it with a wonderful vinaigrette. We ordered the potato pizza which my husband liked, but I however did not. I thought the gorgonzola cheese was way to overpowering - that is all I could taste! So I ordered the margarita pizza with the addition of mushrooms.  It was amazing. The super thin crust gets soggy fast so don't let it sit to long.  My last piece fell apart when I picked it up! The gelato was a perfect ending to our meal - we tried the chocolate pistachio and the almond cherry.  The almond cherry was our favorite hands down! Our waitress was so nice and friendly, and even tho there was not one empty table in the entire restaurant, she took her time answering our questions and never made us feel rushed. My only complaint would be to have more vegan/vegetarian options for pizza. We will definitely be back to eat here again ."}, {"review_id": "Pr1r9wuFhx2T2UqppI7Deg", "user_id": "QvN5NoerRY3goSEG41wBoQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/8/2017", "text": "I have eaten here quite a few times now.

Everything I have had has been delicious but the pizzicletta is by far my favorite. Service is always on point. And you should most definitely save room for gelato.
