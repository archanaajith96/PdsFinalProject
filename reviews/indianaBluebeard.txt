The food was great but the people I spent the evening with were fantastic! It was like a movie. It turns out this place is a destination for foodies. Everyone of us was from out of town and we ended up sharing all of our food. I probably sampled 3/4 of the menu by the time I left.If eating out is about the experience then this place gets 6 stars."}, {"review_id": "X4IXlELx7WXZkLxNA4jKkA", "user_id": "PGx67iTwpL79N48-3ReKJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Ordered:Redbeard cocktail (modified old fashioned)Bread (with assorted butters)Waldorf wedge salad Roasted cauliflower Casarecce (bolognese pasta)Chicken breast (with eggplant and couscous)Bread pudding Pros:Overall, the food is great - fresh, somewhat healthy, and extremely flavorful.The cranberry walnut butter that accompanied the bread was amazing.I really enjoyed the wedge salad - the tomatoes and raisins in the salad were delicious and went really well with the yogurt dressing.Cauliflower had a nice char and crunch.Casarecce contained well made homemade pasta. Cons:The couscous and eggplant medley that accompanied the chicken had a distinct, interesting flavor, but I quickly tired of eating it due to the intensity of the flavor. I favored the casarecce (pasta) entree over the chicken entree. The cocktail was a bit too sweet, could have used less Madagascar vanilla.

Fortunately for me, I made a point to come here on my birthday for dinner. This review only covers food as my dessert/drinks were waiting for me elsewhere on this night. (I'll be back to sample those, for sure!) The entrance to Bluebeard is through a courtyard/outdoor seating area which is very nice and would be an amazing place to sit once it warms up some more. Once inside, the hostess stand is actually a little ways in past some tables on both sides of the \"aisle\". We ended up seated 2 tables away from the door, and it was a chilly evening so I was cold most of the time. I just found it odd that so much seating was near the door like that with so much commotion going on. We decided to get the bread with 3 different butters/spreads to start. The bread is sourced from Amelia's, and really, you can't beat that anywhere in town! It's toasted which is lovely, but the heat dissipates rather quickly so the butter isn't always going to melt. That's okay with me though. The offerings with the toast were: anchovy/herb butter, roasted garlic & olive oil, and cranberry walnut butter. They were all delicious, but honestly? I loved the anchovy/herb butter! I really wasn't expecting to. I don't care for anchovies on anything else, but I think it was just that umami flavor that made me go back for more. Really well done and surprising! For my main course, I got the \"Caviar Dreams\". Yes, that is what it's called! There were 2 salmon croquettes topped with caviar and salmon roe. It came on a smear of parsnip puree with a quenelle of preserved lemon mousse. A bite of each of those all together was very good indeed! The salmon roe was a little odd given the size and texture, and I had never had it before so it took some getting used to. I was also aiming for a dinner that would fill me up but not overly so, and this was a perfect dish for that. It was from the \"medium\" plates section. My husband got his \"usual\" - the pork chop. I got to try it, and it was so good - it was grilled and had the perfect char. The service was excellent and attentive, and I can't wait to come back and try the delightful-sounding desserts and drinks!"}, {"review_id": "K-Aj38pazPraMVay62lIVw", "user_id": "5isALx5RtvA8A_GvQQavTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Farm-to-table.

It's definitely going to become one of our regular go-to's for Sunday evening drinks and apps.Pro-tip: if there's a wait for a table, hop across the street to Hotel Tango and have a cocktail!"}, {"review_id": "BwL0rFZsfNQaBLucrwmPow", "user_id": "rRwEs0MXP1GTlnjlOZ5Baw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "Disclaimer--we only went for the bread pudding!

The bread pudding was beyond delicious. I honestly don't know if I can put into words how delicious this bread pudding was. It came out hot and topped with ice cream and these little crunchy things. It was super moist and fluffy-but not too fluffy that it was like cake. The ice cream had melted into it and it gave it the perfect balance of rich and creamy. If you're looking for a delicious piece of bread pudding, look no further!

The menu is hand crafted and has the biggest variety of surprises I have ever seen. They make everything they possibly can in house including house made sodas, syrups etc. See full cocktail menu here: bluebeardindy.com/libati…We've had quite a few cocktails here over the years, but most recently:Bee's Knees: bone dry gin, lemon, honey, lavender bitters 10Galapagos: alipus mezcal, cabeza tequila, chili arbol syrup, bluebeard orgeat, cucumber, lime 11 (helllllllo Mezcal! If you are a mezcal fan this will flip your world upside down. Highly recommend!) And an off menu cocktail made with arugula. We came here maybe four years ago and this cocktail knocked my socks off. This time, I cozied up to the bar and asked, \"Hiii I know this is really crazy but I came here and ordered an arugula cocktail once, and it was the best I've ever...\" Interupts - \"arugula yeah, the Zabrowski - let me see if the kitchen has any and I will make it for you.\" Me: OMG. DEAD. I believe his name was Mark? He is the one who curates the bar menu. He made it for me, and no joke I almost started crying. It was such a special memory for me. We came here when we were so young and this cocktail seriously made me fall in love with cocktails. It changed the way I think about them, and what they should / shouldn't be. I will never forget it, down to the booth we were sitting in. Thanks for the incredible hospitality Bluebeard, I will never forget you and I will scream from the rooftops how f*cking awesome you are."}, {"review_id": "5iEgOjiv9PEuiACTe76pOA", "user_id": "uF93bjf-T0hmD5jhiamuBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/25/2018", "text": "Wow!

We were here during the Savor Indy weeks, so we got a prix fix meal and some regular appetizers as well. We started with an order of pork buns, a cheese plate and some bread. They were delicious! The pork buns stole the show though. Not what I had envisioned when I read the description, but I was blown away with the flavor of it. Next I had the beet salad, followed by the spaghetti and meatballs and had a bread pudding for dessert. We also tried their chocolate beet cake and everything was great. The beet cake is similar to a red velvet, so don't fret. The meatballs were so, so good. I could have eaten just that and been satisfied.

On the bright side, the menu is pretty expansive so I feel like there's something for everyone.We had the: *Hamachi Tartare (fennel, orange, olives, shallots, moscatel vinaigrette - $16) - oh goodness, I HATED this dish because it was SO fishy. Ugh. *Cured Salmon (smoked caviar, buttered fingerlings, beer vinegar red onion, tarragon, creme fraiche - $16) - loved the presentation on this dish. Dish wasn't anything memorable though but it was eons better than than the hamachi. *Rice Bowl (korean short ribs, sesame rice, kimchi, hb quail egg, ground shrimp, scallions, lettuce, cilantro, jalapeno, shrimp & mushroom tare - $18) - Waste of money because I can make this at home for half the price.....flavors were fine, but not worth $18. *Scallops (israeli couscous, andouille, muhammara, olives, cherry tomato, green harissa - $22) - Scallops were PERFECTLY seared but the dish was very salty. I think the sides were the best part of our meal: *Roasted Cauliflower side (anchovy, caper, mint, parmesan, sunflower seed - $11) - $11for a side?! But, I thought it was actually a better value than the other dishes because it was a huge side! Again, on the salty side though so I couldn't eat too much*Brussel Sprouts (agrodolce, pickled red onion - $11) - Agrodolce just reminded me of balsamic vinegar but I love me some brussel sprouts! Salty, salty, salty though! *Spaghetti (creme fraiche, parmesan, EVOO, gremolata - $10) - This is like my dream come true...it was so butter and creme fraiche and parm heavy. Loved it. But, a little too rich for some of my tablemates! To round out our meal, we ordered the caramel apple pie. The only good part of the dessert was the cinammon semifreddo. Otherwise, the pie itself was really lackluster....cold. kind of tasted old. ugh, I expected so much more.Also, the bar seemed to be understaffed because our table & the tables around us received food before we received our drinks (even though we placed our drink orders first). All in all, I probably won't be back for dinner.

My complaint here is that we were seated in a corner right next to the busy bar area where the staff all hung out when we could have been seated somewhere else as there were tons of empty tables and chairs (The whole room was empty!) We think we were seated in this odd/unfavorable area because the other party in the room were local celebrities that maybe they had asked for privacy. Because of this we also felt like our service lacked because attention was spent on the other party.. even though we were right next to the staff. It took 15 minutes before we got our drinks. I just wanted some wine, ya know. It took even longer for us to order our food even though we were ready.BUT our food was amazing (as always). I had the chicken livers and my bf had the marlin. I had plenty of food and shared with him because even though we both ordered \"medium\" meals he had way less food on his plate and he whispered to me that he was still hungry (lol). Maybe they could add some more chips or slaw to that particular plate in the future because it will not fill up a 200lb man or honestly me for that matter. Our meals were delicious.So good. You can't go wrong with ordering honestly, the meals are unlike other dishes you've had before in the Indianapolis area.We split the chocolate bourbon dessert and i'm a little sad to say i was a little disappointed. I've had their desserts before and they've always been incredible but i felt as if this one was lacking. I think the bourbon overtook all other flavors and it would have been nice to taste the pecan and the chocolate. Overall, we had a nice evening and left in a food coma. I'll probably stick the the vanilla chess pie though (yummmmmmmmm)"}, {"review_id": "MSrBBJqsifr17HObvHV3qg", "user_id": "2pYQ7g7rYN0r9T4aqRRTUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "We came to Bluebeard after hearing good reviews, but not really knowing what to expect. Best decision of the whole week! Bluebeard is tucked away next to Amelia's bakery. It's a small restaurant with a gorgeous interior that gives off an Indie/hipster vibe (thick wood tables, old books lining the walls, wood bar, small tables). We came at about 7:00 on a Friday night and had a 40 minute wait. Even though it was cold outside, they have a fire and heater to keep you warm while you wait. We started out with the charcuterie board and Amelia's bread appetizers and decided that those two dishes were the highlights of our visit and were enough to bring us back again in the future. We also tried the short ribs (not a favorite, they were pretty fatty) and corn dogs (surprisingly good and unique). In addition to the food, the service really made our experience great.

Bluebeard is the epitome of midwestern hospitality.

I had the Wall-Dorf cocktail, which was delicious! Strong, refreshing very flavorful, especially with the celery shrub bitters and house made blueberry basil soda. Upon recommendation by our waitress, we shared everything family style, and we ordered a TON of food. Probably too much, but we were indulging in the abundance because we were meeting coworkers for the first time and reuniting with ones we'd met before.We had the chips and dip, brussel sprouts, chop salad, pappardelle, pork chop, crab cakes and bread pudding. Did I mention that there were only four ladies sitting in our party? We chowed down. My favorites were the chop salad, pappardelle, and crab cakes.

Since it was right down the street from my Airbnb, it immediately went to the top of our list to try. It doesn't take reservations, so we stopped in and were delighted to hear that we could be seated immediately. The place has a definite industrial-chic vibe, as it is a converted warehouse/factory, but each room feels just a little bit different. The front courtyard is simple and elegant, and a firepit makes it feel cozy. The bar in the first room is intimate, with lower ceilings, and the ambience of almost a wine cellar. The bar in the second room had higher ceilings, decorated with old gramophone horns, typewriters, and a $2 bill, apparently a reference to Vonnegut. There is also another room adjacent, again with high ceilings (minus the gramophone horns) and tables that seat 4-6. We ended up grabbing a spot at the gramophone bar, where we were seated next to a cheerfully talkative local. Our meal started out with the Chop Salad. This was the perfect size to split between 2 people, or would make a great entree for 1. Ratios of all the ingredients, the flavors, and the textures were all perfect and provided a great start to the meal. We sipped on wine and talked to each other and our neighbor as we enjoyed the meal. To finish it off, we split the octopus (again, great to split, but may easily and happily feed 1 alone). It was tender (reminded me somewhat of scallops, actually), well-seasoned, and a perfect light entree that evening. We left satisfied, having had excellent service and a meal of farm-fresh ingredients.
