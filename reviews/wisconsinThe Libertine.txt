Definitely a place worth stopping for a drink. The menu of mixed drinks is divided by price making it easy to manage to a budget.The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable and they have a large selection of whiskey based (and other liquors) that she made expertly and quickly.

The bar area feels sort of like a speak-easy with some prohibition art and a super sexy, gigantic bottle of Campari (which actually inspired me to get one of my own). They have a speciality cocktail menu filled with all of the traditional craft drinks you'll see at any high end bar and a few unique ones.  When I'm in Wisconsin, I have to have a Wisco-Old Fashioned (sour with olives)...they make them incredibly! There is generally a good play list on, but I'd love to see live music here.  My only critique besides the lack of live music is the food...or lack there of.  It's hard to keep drinking without some bar snacks.  I will say, the last time I visited in March '18, they were testing some flatbreads that weren't bad, but they also weren't great.Fun facts:  I learned what Bar Dice is here and also Malort."}, {"review_id": "UqVUtdCcTMCAc5s7SEVA1g", "user_id": "Terv9kE1lrZM-WiBRpiBbA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Fantastic cocktails in a rustic bar setting.

Fresh ingredients and the work they put into one drink is an art form. Grating, squeezing, squishing....the freshest and highest quality ingredients all in one glass. Order a craft cocktail and watch them make it---you'll find out for yourself, if you can keep up with how fast they work, that is. Thank you guys and gals of Libertine for being a top destination for my family and friends!"}, {"review_id": "Ww5bxKzyupTePSMbAJHzWQ", "user_id": "mkuMLsBfIscDl_rMjLlzjw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Great place to hang out with friends.

It has a relaxing, hip atmosphere with very knowledgeable bartenders. I'm a beer nerd and for this being a craft cocktail bar, they're constantly rotating different and delicious craft beers.  The cocktails here are great as I always like getting an old fashioned. If you ask the bartenders, they're good at creating drinks that are not on the menu. For me it's a little pricey, but this is a unique bar for the downtown area and I enjoy going here any day of the week."}, {"review_id": "XJ3O9FNclA5z5HtcYXtdBA", "user_id": "BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/9/2015", "text": "I was fairly certain this place had hacked into my Spotify account and was accessing my playlist, because the music was AWESOME. They played Frou Frou, Mr. Scruff, Young Folks, Renegades... All good stuff.Their cocktail menu was also very interesting and reasonably priced at approximately $9 a drink (from the perspective of someone visiting from the west coast Bay Area). Shots were about $5. Unfortunately, the drinks tasted a bit watered down with waaaaay too much ice and were not very strong. At least the version of the vodka based Thai Basil Blueberry something-or-the-other I ordered as well as others I tried sips of seemed pretty weak.We were here for my good friend's bachelorette night and after 1 cocktail and 2 B52 shots (which, granted, is not a strong drink to begin with), I and others were completely sober and without the tiniest hint of a buzz.Still, Libertine has a great ambiance and seems like a fun place to catch up with old friends."}, {"review_id": "riBvN4pzWWjyfwJG1mfLog", "user_id": "WV5XKbgVHJXEgw7f-b6PVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/17/2015", "text": "One of the best bars in Green Bay in regards to drink quality and creativeness.

A small group of us stopped here for pre drinks and then last actually ended up stopping here later in the night.  We arrived around 4:40 p.m., so obviously it was just us, a couple at the bar, a man flying solo on the other end, and then a few groomsmen wandered in for a shot while we were there as well. Later in the evening this place was packed. The menu features all of their craft cocktails, bottle beer and wine. They also do have a draft menu written on a large chalkboard. I had the bees knees, a pumpkin ale, and then on the second trip was ending in water for the night. The decor is typical of the craft cocktail establishments - exposed brick, lots of wood high tops and chairs, old barrels as decorations, and industrial lighting. I love also when a bartender dresses up. One thing I will say is there high tops have been destroyed, and need a little work. They took old wood and covered it with a plastic top, but in some spots it's cracked, missing or just uneven. They have an upstairs...we were curious as to what was actually up there, but a sign of course let us know it was closed. With a bunch of drunk thirty year olds at the end of the night, you can imagine the curiosity and urge to check it out. Expect prices to be higher. It's a craft cocktail place after all. Although, many in our group had more than a handful of Old Fashions, and I know they run some specials during the week."}, {"review_id": "arPyZHh5E3zJlCX63b8-sw", "user_id": "P3w9TwdieG7kYm8UQ0hb0g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2016", "text": "Jon  makes the best cocktails In town.

Walked down to this place around 10pm. Wasn't searching for this place in particular, but it just seemed to beckon me to come inside.The bar is dimly lit in a tasteful way which made me feel as if I was I back in the prohibition era. The crowd was a mix of well dressed mid 20's to early 30's men and women. The bar has two dart boards, one pool table, a couple of gambling machines, and free popcorn. There were probably around 30 people in the bar with just a single bartender. I was served immediately. I started off with an old fashioned, which was phenomenal,  and then proceeded to have an assortment of their crafted cocktails. These guys make incredible drinks at a very reasonable price.  This \"drinking establishment\" will definitely be added to my list of favorites.If you're in the Green Bay area and are looking for a unique place to have a world class cocktail instead of the typical beer bar then look no further. You will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "q-CItTD4woGCDDUM-i3v7A", "user_id": "7kJMYe4xoUc_ND6bOAUsWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/20/2016", "text": "I'm pregnant so I didn't get any alcoholic drinks but my friends enjoyed theirs. One of my friends told the guy bartender that I was pregnant and asked for a good virgin cocktail. It was awesome! I'm not sure of what exactly was all in it but it contained their ginger beer, blueberries and an orange slice for sure. Best virgin cocktail ever so I feel they know what they're doing. I really liked the atmosphere too. Overall a good place. The only weird thing was that my friend ordered the drink \"zee plane zee plane\" and the girl bartender kind of grimaced and said that was their most sent back drink so he asked if it wasn't good and she said yeah. So he got a different drink that was cheaper, kind of strange for a bartender to say one of their \"popular\" drinks wasn't good. But I guess it was good he got a warning? Also she kept talking to some guys while he was trying to order. But honestly overall good place."}, {"review_id": "qTF795GUFO9rkWECBk_IsQ", "user_id": "PtcT-AIfVGzSSKyQzibWBw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/1/2015", "text": "A guy walks into a bar......and is met with high-class amenability.
