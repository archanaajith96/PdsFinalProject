Breakfast today was meat lover's omelette, with ham, sausage, and bacon with their delicious pancake as the side. It is very reasonably priced for $8.75 but would have cost about $15.00 in California; almost double the price; but half the quality. If you are around the area, and your stomach is growling, satisfy your tummy by having a meal at the Shack. Your Mind, Body, and Soul (MBS) will be extremely content."}, {"review_id": "nqvDrvKyxMhz27G1RSNJxQ", "user_id": "xi_McLEtHzAk-RfG-nC4Vw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "We made a last minute decision for breakfast after being in town for the Jim Gaffigan show.  We heard really good things, including the claim of the best pancakes in North Dakota, so we decided to head on down.  Wait was about twenty minutes, but that wasn't bad at all for how busy they were. Once seated the service was friendly.  I got the steak and eggs while my girlfriend got pancakes.  Now, I'm not expecting steakhouse quality at a breakfast joint, but my steak had almost no sear and an accompanying lack of seasoning. The pancakes looked amazing, and the serving size was large, but left us underwhelmed.  Overall, I wouldn't say the meal was bad, we just got excited for the hype and the meal just didn't live up to it."}, {"review_id": "0uBx5rCQObIlxkI6lXMUpg", "user_id": "_Un-hbUIlpOafhj4lh_6RA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/8/2017", "text": "The Shack on Broadway blew me away. Coming from a major U.S city to this small place in rural Fargo, the value and service I received blew me away like a prairie wind scattering the chaff. There are three parts to any great restaurant: service, food quality, and value. I'll address all 3.SERVICE: Jodi absolutely blew me away with her service. No, really. I experience her level of service at 5-star restaurants where an appetizer costs more than my entire Shack meal and where \"intermezzo\" isn't the assumed name of an Italian restaurant. Jodi was incredibly attentive to me. She gets customer service and it shows. The whole time I was at The Shack, she was pinball-ing between my table and thr kitchen, her other table and the kitchen, back to me, refilling coffee, etc. She was in great spirits the whole time. Great sense of humor. Request Jodi!! FOOD: I ordered 2 items: Banana Nut muffin and a #3 (eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast). The Banana Nut muffin came to me first. As I bit into it, it was very moist, almost too much. As I tasted the banana flavor.....well, there wasn't a whole lot of banana flavor. The banana flavor was faint. But for $2.50, I'm not going to complain. Proper price point. Now the #3: Whoa! I paid $6.25 for absolute mountain of food. It really blew me away. The eggs were scrambled with that familiar diner-feel. The hash browns were that perfect golden-brown on the outside but steamy and buttery rich on the inside. The bacon was properly cooked: not whiskey-dick limp, but not charcoal-dark either. Just right. Toast was lightly browned on  the outside. I mean, everything was great. The coffee: I wasn't expecting some Brazilian-trained, eco-forest-logically natural-organic bean with Indian-mound levels of flavor. I expected typical breakfast-place coffee. And that's what I got. It wasn't burned. See, here's why I'm mentioning it: it didn't take AWAY from my enjoyment. Many places burn their coffee or serve bad coffee and it detracts from the experience. Unlimited coffee that didn't detract from my meal, for $1.75? Even elementary school bake sales charge more for just a single cup. VALUE: You can see the mountain of food in the pictures that I got for $6.25. The muffin, although lacking enough flavor for my tastes, was appropriately priced at $2.50. Lastly, I had a glass of milk which cost me $2 (industry average) and coffee which cost me $1.75. The coffee didn't detract and it was unlimited, adding to the value it gave to the meal. All of this food for $13.44 (including tax) PLUS Jodi's world-class service? I had my doubts about this small breakfast place in Fargo. So, I say to The Shack on Broadway: I'm sorry I ever doubted you."}, {"review_id": "suWnEE8bSdeR8q8zXTcwgQ", "user_id": "1DhKvepHRNKs3aUw6NSOKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "Good brunch place, with tons of options to meet any cravings. My personal favorite is the blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup which are incredible. Everything is really tasty, and while some things are frozen, it tastes like homemade food. Super nice service, very quick. Expect to wait at least half an hour on weekends if not more, and to be given your check halfway through the meal. Not a place to spend hours, but definitely a place to have a great brunch!"}, {"review_id": "FqRNHuGmbeRf7kGSB8A9ew", "user_id": "_ydEtiXwbgGQaNaqNJqYYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "What you see is what you get.  A local diner with good food, good coffee and great service!  There is certainly a reason this is a Yelp favourite, the coffee never stopped (they get bonus points for that from me).  They have \"famous pancakes\" and they didn't disappoint and while I didn't try the caramel bun it looked amazing and other diners were raving about it.  Thanks for taking care, we will be back on our next trip to town."}, {"review_id": "NimYxvIw4I3HxKKnfv0h1Q", "user_id": "8xCzdbcbdFwqZF5FgLZWOw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Best pancakes I have ever had. Great service, friendly and prompt. We ate here both mornings in Fargo because the first one was so good. Meat lovers omelet was great, as were the hashbrown and the corned beef hash. The steak for the steak and eggs was juicy and well cooked. The caramel roll was warm, gooey and huge. Get here early if you want one because they sell out. The only ding is that the coffee is classic old diner style: it didn't taste bad but was weak.

It's not amazing. There is an employee there named Amy Joe who was so incredibly rude to me and friend. I had brought in medicine in a cup from my house. I was feeling a little bit under the weather. And she confronted me and told I couldn't have my own mug in the store even after my explanation. I'm a well known travel nurse. I won't be recommending this place because of that.

Let me tell you it was busy. Just about every table full. They got us seated quick however. Like surprisingly quick. The wait staff was attentive, polite, and well paced. And it was packed. I was very impressed. The food was good. Had the special of the day, which has been brought up by other Yelpers, the eggs Benedict which was delicious. A good hollandaise sauce is easy to ruin, I know from experience. This was great and filling. I will be coming back to try other items like biscuits and gravy and the hot beef sandwich which I spied on the table next to us. Overall great place when you just want it done right!"}, {"review_id": "1Nkd6CNjauuWoJ-v-28KwQ", "user_id": "voUSZ1HeaEdD7W00NocerQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "8/18/2017", "text": "Average diner fare.

I love the little diners that have all the old timers that eat there. Got the meat lovers omelette and it is the most popular for a reason.
