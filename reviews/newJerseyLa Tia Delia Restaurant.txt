We ordered the green rice with chicken that come with a side of potatoes with creamy cheese sauce .  Our meal was very good, the chicken a little dry but all in all very tasty.  For dessert we ordered the tres leche and a slice of chocolate cake and coffee.  Both were very good.  Tres leche was fresh and moist and the chocolate cake was also very good.  We will definitely go back."}, {"review_id": "zUckoaZZNzQ6q3qdy8n21w", "user_id": "la_GgmtxWpf3VPcLh8HKXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/6/2017", "text": "My husband and I are so glad we found this place.

Shrimp ceviche was tasty and presented nicely, shrimp chaufa had the best grilled shrimp I've had in quite some time, sancocheado soup was light and delicious and the lomo salteado was also tasty and cooked to perfection.  Thanks to the good staff and speedy service on the afternoon of 11/5/16.  Muchísimas gracias"}, {"review_id": "1zK9F1y7Uv-pfI-t38DGTQ", "user_id": "fSybAPY1P3YNqJDA_-WRhQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/6/2016", "text": "Traditional home style Peruvian cuisine. An extensive menu with lots of very fresh seafood options and ample portions at reasonable prices. Very authentic flavored and ingredients used make La Tia Delia a wonderful culinary experience for those who venture to Patterson. The Green Chicken with Huancaina is really good!

The thing about Tia Delia is that their food is so on point, the ingredients are as almost identical as the ones used in Peru. The portions are big, so you most likely will take some home. If you're Peruvian, They have every Peruvian dish you haven't taste in years. My only complain about this place, besides the \"no reservations\" policy, is how short-staff they are. Today during my visit for Father's day, there were literally only two servers. They didnt delay on giving out the food, but I felt bad for the serves since they definitely needed more helping hands. Hopefully this changes in a near future. Overall, what a great restaurant. Highly recommend it if you want someone to taste real Peruvian gastronomy."}, {"review_id": "QmlVsHBh4OL4fb9b_qZraw", "user_id": "93i3SmY9se2iDQ8mqv5WOA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/23/2014", "text": "I enjoyed this place. 1) If you like Peruvian food, this place is great. 2) The prices are reasonable, and the food comes out pretty quickly.3) Only issue is finding parking."}, {"review_id": "JYYH2HiQZPMudiMVN6BufQ", "user_id": "oOU1lnLZ3gI76eKoRxm6PQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/1/2017", "text": "I really like this place.Been going there for years.Always fast service.

I ordered the hen soup and he order a chupe de camaro. My soup came first which I had to take my large hen breast and cut into pieces (which its OK) however my man received his soup and as he was eating it he found a BUG in his soup. These things could happen anywhere and even the fancy restaurant but when he got up and went my the kitchen to call over the waiter he said the kitchen nasty and very  messy. There is no excuse it was a Monday night with only 3 tables (a family of four, a table of one and us two).

My mom wanted Peruvian breakfast so it was her day. So when we were there the service was horrible!  The food came out and our drinks didn't.  The wait staff was extremely short.  Only two!!!  Why on gods green earth would this place only have two on a busy busy day!!  They moved like molasses.  They messed up our food order.  Our food was undercooked.  I think they were just rushing.  The pressure probably got to much for them.  Now I will be back, only for lunch and hopefully they do something with their wait staff.  Urgh.  But the lunch there is definitely really good. So all and all go here for lunch,  and never on a busy holiday."}, {"review_id": "edrzX4b1fCre0dI_c-DQag", "user_id": "QQtoHnP0cP7nzNnUob_1CQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/2/2014", "text": "I love Peruvian food and this was a really solid representation, very authentic.  They have a huge menu.
