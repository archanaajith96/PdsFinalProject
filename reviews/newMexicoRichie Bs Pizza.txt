They have the best NY style pizza around. Just look at the photos of their massive slices that take up two plates all loaded with melted cheese and Italian spices. I seriously couldn't stop eating it, even though I knew we had dessert on the way. I noticed when we were leaving that they have a special sauce called house made viper sauce, so the next time I'm ordering some of that for sure.Their sub sandwiches look delicious too. The next time I'm up this way I'm going to pick up a few for sure. I don't think I will be able to choose between their Italian sandwich or their hot cheese steak sandwich. They also have a punch card to reward loyal customers with free sandwiches and pizzas."}, {"review_id": "kAuLRBIiZmveZ6GJ5s7_iw", "user_id": "ST5KHMoxf9d7BDZnfLLsTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/21/2017", "text": "What a great pizza! The style is thin and crispy with a nice layer of cheese. I tried the veggie while my husband had  meat on his. I can see how folks would consider the pizza greasy but that's a sign of real cheese. The slice was huge... but it wasn't overwhelming since it was so thin. We also tried a philly. The bread is out of sight! The hot melty cheese with the onions really just created a combo that we couldn't stop eating. I didn't think the sauce added anything to the sando, on the other hand my husband did like it. Finally we had to have a cannoli. I'm no cannoli expert but I can't say I tasted the mascarpone, it seems like it was a premix and not homemade. Overall this is a great local spot. The service was prompt and the food came out hot and fast. I would recommend trying it out."}, {"review_id": "p-4QYb71JStgvVOvHS5tOQ", "user_id": "K7kPD-0JAoPC1c_WVTE6Qg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/23/2017", "text": "Huge slices! I mean two-plates-needed-good-luck-finishing-it huge. I like the thin crust and the crisp to the bottom, the cheese quality could be a little better in terms of flavor but it's still amazing compared to other options in ABQ. We've been here a few times, sometimes you get your slice in 2 minutes, sometimes it takes 25 minutes so bear that in mind and be flexible. If it takes longer, that just means it's fresher! This is our go to place for NY style pizza in Albuquerque."}, {"review_id": "a6ZhnyGEwIU5-Oob2bHsyg", "user_id": "dJq-SlIUo0PGKQTVctFB0A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "Everyone talks about the humongous slices and pizzas. But what else is there to talk about? This is really the draw for me. Their largest pie is 25 inches in diameter. Now that's a serious pizza. It's a mighty fine pizza. A solid New York-style pizza with crust not too thick and not too thin. Richie B's has nailed the NY pizza to perfection. You can get subs here, too. They are good and what you'd expect from such a place. If you're not up for pizza, they have a really good salad. And they have a variety of sides like French fries, whole garlic pickles, which you really shouldn't miss, and stuffed cherry peppers. Of course, they have Hatch green chile. Richie B's is in New Mexico for goodness sakes! They gotta have green chiles. All of this good stuff beyond their enormous pizzas. I just don't know how a person can order anything else. Well, except the garlic pickles. And would you guess they have desserts, too? Yup, they do. Maybe get some beers or a few glasses of wine and hang out for a few hours. Then you might feel more justified getting a cannoli or New York-Style cheesecake. Yeah, get 'em both. They're worth it."}, {"review_id": "Rh_mb6nbsSYfCBwsBTzbSg", "user_id": "9ApwSHO69hU49XYuXIdw_Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/11/2018", "text": "NY style pizza - good toppings and hot green chile.

Love Richie B's! The pizza, a thinish crust version, is crispy yet chewy. Sauce and cheese are perfect. In fact, probably a place where a cheese pizza would satisfy. However, be sure to try the steak pizza. The Philly Cheesesteak has good meat on a chewy hoagie roll. Owner and staff are very friendly.6/26/2016 Thankyou Preston.

Dinner party after glorious dinner party. Delectable treat after treat. Until I join with the rest of America on the yearly pilgrimage to....sigh.....The Muffin-Top Crossroads: that terrifying place where one must choose their fate....do we buy bigger jeans??? Or do we bust out the Fluidity Bar, wipe the dust off of the protein shake container, let P-90X awaken us from our sugar comas & exercise our hearts and bodies into cardiovascular oblivion...yesssssss....but really, that's a conversation for tomorrow.Because today is the last day of the year my friends, that's right. And there's no better way to cap off the year than to go big...I mean REALLY BIG. We're talking 25\" of deliciousness to go, 1/2 supreme (for me and the hubs), 1/2 cheese (for the littles)...Holy cannoli, I must have died and gone to pizza heaven. This was worth every. single. calorie. I could barely get the pizza box through Richie B's door to get it to the car. The slices were as big as my head. Literally. New Yawkas, stand up and be counted. This right here is your slice of heaven in the heart of the Southwest. This is the thin crust you've been looking for since you left The Big Apple, the crust you thought didn't exist west of the Mississippi. Not too crackery, not too doughy, not greasy whatsoever, just sheer perfection. Homemade sauce. Homemade dough, kneaded and served with all the foodie love that you would get sittin' at Nonna's table.Preston is truly a gem. The homemade ranch and spicy viper sauce were both phenomenal, seriously folks, my husband and I were exchanging glances of ecstasy in between each bite. You absolutely MUST make it a priority to visit Richie B's for your next pizza fix. This joint will easily soar to the very top of your list of best pizza joints in Albuquerque!!!"}, {"review_id": "JLvx7Kca4oNdALZjzoBkWw", "user_id": "z0CNbP1xTODPmQaRwZLnzQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/31/2017", "text": "Moved to NM from NY closest I've found to real NY pizza here.  However it comes at a price!   Overpriced from what I was use to getting in NY but since everything else in NM is cheaper I'll call it even.   The do sell pizza by the slice which is what I will do for now on when I'm missing a taste of NY. We ordered the pepperoni and pineapple however our pizza was missing the pineapple.  Shame on me for not checking the order before taking it home.  The pepperoni was very good.  The cannoli was AMAZING.  Seriously get one actually no get two!!"}, {"review_id": "c-FIHm0ZiOZoLdoZPPdrWg", "user_id": "s7DOGaUBVoyVgwdmCQWiVQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/19/2017", "text": "Awkward! I read review after review about Richie Bs Pizza and was convinced I'd never need to visit another ABQ pizzeria again. I ordered a couple slices at their cute shop only to find this is a re-iteration of (gasp!) warehouse pizza. I really wanted to keep an open mind, given how it folds into a New York pizza polygon coupled with the size and price of each slice. I mean, each slice is like two or three \"normal\" slices. I can see the appeal for that reason alone, however, the dough was flavorless. I don't know if they overcooked it by accident or if it was intentional, but the texture felt like cardboard. I may have come in on an off-day or the teens in the back were not paying attention to their pies, but Richie Bs was more upstate than downtown."}, {"review_id": "8-xYEhlMLp_RR39mn0iKUg", "user_id": "Mz6ezGeH1ZP1Vf4VocR7rg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/25/2017", "text": "Quick bite and friendly staff with okay pizza.We ordered the 18\" Supreme Pizza and Garden House Salad with house-made vinaigrette dressing.
