It is a cute place with super fresh ingredients and an amazing staff to put it all together. I have never been here without it being super busy which I think in a way speaks to how good the food is but because it is so small of a space this can present a problem in terms of feeling a little overcrowded. For what little indoor seating there is they make up for in outdoor space which is crappy for the winter but great for the summer. I like the counter set up and honestly nothing else would work at a place like Tallulah's. Once I figured out that if you had already ordered food and just wanted a second margarita you could go to the side of the counter I was set for life. I really think Tallulah's is worth it's tiny pitfalls and I'm so happy to live within walking distance to such an amazing place.I almost forgot! Don't skip the churros! To choose a quote  from myself to sum them up: \"if you want a churro get your own because I'm not sharing.\""}, {"review_id": "F1k2xaXUhBHaD-wNcZpmSw", "user_id": "x4c6caQB6M84MM75yk5_Gw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Best tacos in town.

I'll be honest, because I live in Southern California, I expected this Rhode Island taco shop to be horrible, relatively speaking. I was wrong, as I often am - and this time glad to be wrong. Tallulah's Taqueria is good enough that they could set up shop in San Diego and still be successful, which is the highest praise I'm willing to give any taco shop in New England.Here, owner and chef Jake Rojas serves Chihuahua-inspired tacos, tortas, quesadillas, bowls, and burritos while espousing a locally-sourced food philosophy. The tacos I ate during my visit included:* Lengua Taco - charred chunks of tender lengua (beef tongue) -- this may have been one of the best lengua tacos I've had anywhere, and having eaten lots of tacos in Mexico and California, that's saying something.* Fish Taco - Tallulah's battered and fried fish taco was alright, and dare I say excellent for east coast, though probably would be a bit below average in Southern California due to the bland white sauce served here lacking the character and punch I've come to expect.* Shrimp Taco - I asked for my Shrimp Taco here asado (grilled) and they gave it to me deep-fried (frito). Therefore the same quibble I have with the Fish Taco applies to this one. Because I was with a business associate, I didn't fuss over their mistake.Bottom line is that Tallulah's Lengua Taco kicks serious ass and, from my single visit, is what I'd recommend you order here. Also, although this place would be middle-of-the-road where I'm from, I realize it is INCREDIBLE for New England, so I've adjusted my Yelp rating accordingly.

These tacos are not cheap. I ordered 2 fish tacos and an al pastor tacos with all of the toppings on them. These tacos are massive. The pastor taco had huge chunks of pork and the salsa was actually quite spicy. I don't know if the flavors blow me away but they are good. The fried fish taco was also spilling over the sides of the 2 corn tortillas. There was guacamole over them and a cabbage slaw. The fish chunks were delicious, white and nicely battered for a nice crunch.Also had a mango Fresca which was okay. Wasn't an intense mango flavor. Service is prompt and thorough. I probably won't crave these tacos late at night because they're wicked expensive. They start at $4 a piece. Flavor and quality are good but I'd prefer smaller questionable taco shops instead."}, {"review_id": "xIQ35RFXr68PER6-Hx2Tug", "user_id": "bCTYk3wS06a-I6l0uocw5A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Fellow Yelpers !

Not being that familiar with the area, I was impressed with the taqueria; very hip, very cool, good food.Initially, I had gone to a record store down the street to try and sell off some vinyl a few months back, and decided to see if there was anywhere I could grab a bite since it was around lunchtime for me. With my Mom in tow, we decided on Tallulah's, which looked like a cool spot to grab some grub. Definitely, a popular place as there was a line out the door to have your order taken at the counter. I think we were in line for 20 minutes, but we weren't in any rush. The staff at the counter were friendly and cool -- yes, I've said this adjective a lot, but it really defines the place, the food, and the people. You could tell they were adapt at handling the long lines and clientele -- mostly college students and 20-somethings, but also people like myself and my Mom. It is a small place, take note; therefore, there's not a lot of inside seating apart from some counter stools around the perimeter of the restaurant, leaving an outside patio deck to the left of the taqueria. Fortunately, this was during the springtime, so the weather was nice, as we grabbed a couple of seats at one of the communal pub tables outside. Their carnitas burrito was delicious -- pork belly and shoulder combined with guac, onions, salsa, beans, the usual suspects. Definitely was satisfying for sure. So, if you live in the area, or are just visiting, and need to satisfy a craving for tacos and/or burritos, do check out this spot."}, {"review_id": "DPVhhn68DsCneMNebkW-Vg", "user_id": "6pTHuzch57b5uvHDqjMvqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Beat tacos in providence, hands down!

I have to say that I've rarely had tacos so delicious. The options are many - pork, beef, chicken, and vegetarian. The flavor is awesome. I came here after a friend recommended it and I wasn't disappointed. I chose to get three tacos (they're about 4\" tacos with a doubled corn tortilla and quite a mound of filling). I got the barbacoa, potato, and chicken. All three were completely different but equally delicious. My husband got two chicken tacos and a barbacoa burrito and said that both were delicious. My daughter got a child's chicken quesadilla, and while the tortilla was a bit difficult for her to eat, she absolutely loved the filling. The atmosphere is very nice. They offer both outside and inside seating. We chose to sit inside purely because if the sun factor and our attempt to keep my daughter out of it. The eating area is small but I didn't feel crowded. Even with the ebb and flow of the line, it still didn't feel like people were on top of us while we tried to eat. I'm honestly curious as to how the tacos would keep for takeout, and I'm sure I'll find out at some point.

This was a bit disappointing because I've always been a fan of Jake Rojas and what he brings to the PVD restaurant scene. Consequently, I approached Tallulah's brick and mortar with some hesitation; I needn't have been so worried! Guys. They have lengua. On the menu. Every day. And it's great. In general, they have the best burritos I've had since I've lived in PVD. The space is small, occupying the old Dok's on Ives, and it's really really packed at peak times. Outside seating in good weather is great but also very limited. We love to use the app and order/pay online because it saves a ton of time and effort. All you do is pop in, grab your stuff and go. Love it. Parking is street and can likewise be hard at peak. So, the cost...yeah. It's pricey. $9 for a burrito is a gut punch to my cheap sensibilities, but I don't mind it as an sometime splurge. It's worth the flavor of that lengua burrito."}, {"review_id": "wfGKsp4cSUmh9Be7S2l-KA", "user_id": "a46bdZWEDk3jiKY73aP6ow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/7/2018", "text": "Tallulah's is THE place for tacos in Providence. My go-to are the shrimp and fish tacos, which both come fried or grilled (but fried are superior obviously). While I wouldn't normally gravitate towards a potato taco, their chipotle braised potato taco is a standout. All of their protein options are also available in burrito, torta, bowl, or quesadilla form. The bowls are great for a non-messy on-the-go meal. I'm also a big fan of the fried shrimp torta which comes on a delicious bolillo roll. Tallulah's also has beer and margaritas available as well as an in-house agua fresca, which they'll happily add tequila to. The churros are fluffy and crispy-the perfect ending to a great meal at Tallulah's.The only downside to Tallulah's is the wait time/seating availability. While they have expanded their outdoor seating, in the colder months it can get pretty cramped and loud on the weekend. Between the line and the wait for food, it can take up to 30 minutes to get your meal which is not ideal for a quick casual counter-service restaurant. However, they do take online orders which allows you to bypass the line for pick-up. The staff here is also extremely friendly and courteous.

Went for a dinner date with Mom and my 10 month old. There really isn't parking but it's easy to find street parking as it's on the corner of an intersection. Since I had not been before, I didn't realize that they didn't have high chairs available so I ran back to my car and grabbed the stroller. The inside is quite tiny, there's a single long table with stools on either side as well as a small ledge on the windows. Outside seating is essentially picnic tables on both sides of this little dive spot.There was a ton of traffic in and out of this place which confirmed that it's was the right place to be. It appears you can order ahead through and app or order in line and the food is either packaged to go or brought out to your chosen table. We opted for the latter.My mom and I like to share things as we get to try two different things. We ordered the Torta with Carne Asada which was essentially a freshly baked Portuguese roll from the bakery next door with all the yummy Mexican fixings. We also ordered a burrito with the fried fish. Both were extremely good! I'm usually a bowl gal at Chipotle and we will definitely try that and a taco next time.
