A Asian fusion twist of the food, was interesting but not that potent. My burger was really sloppy and hard to eat, and I only got a chicken burger. The chicken was too big for the bun, the cheese was like triple the chicken and a bit gross. We got buffalo chicken dip and it was barely room temperature. However I will say that it tasted good and had potential.I usually like to go with server recommendations on beers, and it hasn't failed me yet... until here. The grapefruit hefeweizen is terrible. It's like a Smirnoff Ice. There was also a chocolate porter she recommended that tasted more like a brown ale, minus the flavor.It's downtown, so there is street parking everywhere, or you can park on the street behind the building.Price: reasonable.Would I come here again? Probably not :/ the food was definitely a miss."}, {"review_id": "09ZOwiRDxE2wfHhdpL-TBg", "user_id": "6BXy1ZHPlNp8ygfpPSPhtA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Burgers are incredible.  Try the \"LifeChanger\" aka \"TCB\".  Whiskey choices are good.  Maybe have an advertised new offering every so often. The fifth star missing, noise.  I try to bring my parents, older friends and friends w kids and they all agreed, the volume is really loud. Not sure how to lessen the noise, maybe keep music a nominal level, add speakers to bar area if they'd like to have music louder."}, {"review_id": "lZtujth3w6TveQVyud7WaA", "user_id": "j6BRJ8jusugvoV0EbFUpYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "Server : Brittnay gets a 5 StarFood : 4 Stars Appetizer :Stars (Buffalo Chicken Dip)Had Elway Burger and Cali Burger .

We got the buffalo chicken dip appetizer and it was wonderful. We may or may not have used our fries that came with our burgers to get every single last bit of it out of the bowl. My husband got his normal TCB burger with fresh jalapeños instead of honey and enjoyed it. My sister got The Remedy (which.... how have I never seen this one on the menu?!?) and I ordered the mushroom Swiss burger. I have almost tried all of the burgers and the mushroom Swiss was probably my least favorite of all of them. I'll go back to either Teriyaki, Cali or the Bleu Buffalo with chicken next time. Or I can try one of the dishes on the left hand side like I've been saying for months now! The service was great and my sister and husband both loved their dishes."}, {"review_id": "dQ28oQdyCrSpGRsK9EtABw", "user_id": "7LpG-L08zvgIv_N_9CeRJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "This place has the best burgers in Augusta!  Great atmosphere.  The sweet potatoe fries or the buffalo blue cheese waffle fries are must try side items.  I highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "0ddxPK54qr-_d1gCwwXXWA", "user_id": "5HAFGFAnAqRc8sqCk1A8jA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "The food is ok.

I visited for lunch and was ready to eat! The menu is a unique blend of bar favorites like burgers and fries, as well as Asian fare like teriyaki chicken and Japanese curry. It was a tough decision but I think I found the perfect solution: the teriyaki burger! A juicy patty with teriyaki, grilled pineapple, smoked gouda and Asian house white dressing. On the side, I opted for sweet potato fries and the suggested coconut cream dipping sauce. As I mentioned before, this burger was GOOD but definitely messy. The sweet potato fries were tasty, as well. If you're a coconut fan, you'll definitely enjoy that sauce. I'm not so opted for the fries rather plain, but they also ten different sauces and eight dressings to spice up any dish. My lunch date got the pig sandwich - panko breaded pork loin, Asian slaw, katsu sauce and wasabi mayo, on lettuce instead of bread. In other words, if you want to be a little healthier, they can accommodate. We weren't drinking this afternoon so I didn't get to try any of the whiskey! Next time I'm in Augusta though, me and the bar at WBK have a date."}, {"review_id": "stQkPraSQ77epJ1YQJqaWw", "user_id": "C0PP2JtygHlxqNCA-Utn8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Love, love, love the Katsu Curry Pork and Rice. Not your traditional curry but it was just fantastic, rare to find in the states. Had cravings all the next day for it. The pour from the bartender was also leaving nothing to be desired.

It was busy but we manage to get a booth. Huge bar with loads of TVs and a loud crowd. Mostly burgers and bar food. The waiter was very good and went into detail about everything on the menu and the beer selection. We ordered two beers and continued to mull over the menu. I decided to have a veggie burger and my friend ordered a rice bowl with beef. My burger came with a side and I picked onion rings. Our food came out after about 10 minutes. My veggie burger was OK and so were the onion rings, my friend said the rice bowl was OK as well. I guess for bar food it was not a bad choice but I think it might be a better place to drink. Very lively crowd but I did see a couple with a baby. Maybe the baby liked all the noise, if he cried, I doubt anyone would have noticed."}, {"review_id": "uUz2Zy6VTb6BRZAA1rpm_w", "user_id": "zWjtQTkE01SIz_FxqF0DWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Love the menu, I try to try something different but I am stuck on a few of my favorites."}, {"review_id": "84OjSCepS_q5YpeIWOzQNg", "user_id": "XTkuInJdNwHbuw_TJNW7lw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2017", "text": "I recently got recommended to this place after talking to a co worker about burger places to take my wife. It was a 45 minute wait for a table which was fine because it was first Friday and Cinco de Mayo. We stopped at another restaurant to get a quick bite to hold us over while we waited to be seated.The atmosphere was pretty cool. I liked the set up of the bar and drinks weren't overly priced. I ordered \"The Sink\" burger, which has plenty of good ingredients on it. I also had a side order of onion rings and a Long Island Iced Tea.For me, the burger was nothing special. Not as good as advertised by my co worker who told me that it was a better burger place than Farmhaus. However, the onion rings were by far the star of the show. Fried so perfectly, crispy, golden brown and they had a buttery taste. I'll try this place again and maybe order something other than a burger, but im definitely drinking and getting more of those onion rings. I give them a 3/5, nothing special but not bad either."}, {"review_id": "Rf_an9W1ZfgO4CP4tpe3VA", "user_id": "tjIdhD3ySprBHrhbnNK2aQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/3/2017", "text": "I love going to the Whiskey Bar!
