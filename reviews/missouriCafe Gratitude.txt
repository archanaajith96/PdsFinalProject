I have loved everything that I've tried here.Everything is plant-based and vegan, so it's nice to have such a wide array of menu options and not have to worry about modifications. A lot of my meat-eating friends love it as well. We are all obsessed with the Bruschetta appetizer (I am Present) because the cashew mozzarella is just sooooooo creamy and delicious. I typically stick with this and the Caesar salad (I am Dazzling). It has a Brazil nut \"parmesan\" that is to die for and the capers add a nice saltiness to the dish. The dessert alone is also worth coming to Cafe Gratitude. I think they switch up the tray seasonally, but they did have a chocolate hazelnut cheesecake that for sure tasted like the \"real deal.\" I really enjoyed it because it was more light and fluffy versus a super dense cheesecake. I'm a little cynical for the all around positive vibes going on here but, it works for them."}, {"review_id": "-1_EqySJuNV5h2GTVq19PA", "user_id": "XK5e1Q8iIylKiz4V_POlwA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Oh my gosh. Cafe Gratitude is amaaaaazing....My first time here a friend and I ordered three appetizers, an entree each, and an additional entree to share, haha! We had a huge problem trying to choose between all the delicious sounding options on their menu. We ended up ordering the buffalo cauliflower, the roasted potatoes, the eggplant parm sandwich, eggplant parm alfredo with spaghetti squash, and the mac and cheese. Literally everything I put in my mouth was so good, it was all extremely fresh tasting and had just the perfect flavors! I will warn you that the \"buffalo\" sauce on the cauliflower is not traditional buffalo sauce like you'd think, it doesn't look or taste like it, but it's still damn good. Same goes for the \"alfredo\" sauce... not anything like your typical heavy cream & cheese sauce, but still to die for!!! You will never go wrong with their roasted potatoes appetizer and the mac and cheese is obviously too good. Lastly, the eggplant parm sandwich was on some super yummy toasted bread and absolutely delightful! Good luck trying to choose what you want to eat here, they have a big menu and it all sounds so good. My favorite thing about Cafe Gratitude is that fact that they use REAL food ingredients, they're not big on the fake cheeses and meats like some of the other all vegan restaurants are. They use whole, organic ingredients and their entire menu is plant-based, and they managed to make it all delicious and satisfying! Also - every menu item has a nice name like the \"Awesome\" or \"Zesty\" or \"Fulfilled\" etc., and when they bring you your food they announce it to your table as \"You are awesome\", \"You are zesty\" or \"You are fulfilled\", as if they're telling you that you are all these things and it's kinda funny but a cute idea!I can't wait to go back to Kansas City so I can try another multitude of items they offer. I'm just sad I didn't try their desserts...I can only imagine what those taste like!!! Love this place!!!"}, {"review_id": "y7R7cIWSe1wmdlP6iTIZJQ", "user_id": "hilL60vuuh06sMxs6Ckkog", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "The food I ordered was good. I had the sweet potato tacos which comes with a side salad. All the ingredients were very fresh and yummy. My only complaint about my first visit here was the coffee. I wanted to try something new so I got the maca latte. The smell and taste was incredibly offputting. I told my server that the taste was not to my liking and to please bring me a cafe mocha instead. I also told her that I had no problem paying for the beverage regardless. I took literally 4 sips of the coffee prior to changing it. When I got the bill, they charged me for both coffees which were $5 each. Yes, I'm aware that I said I would pay for it, but it's a matter of principle. Most places would simply exchange and apologize that it wasn't to the customers liking. I got neither. The service itself was rather lack-luster for my first visit. I'm not exactly sure I'll return for a second try."}, {"review_id": "qVrBXxFlhDGFN2YKmPuTJA", "user_id": "C8n15LhT5P8bz5llz7EK8g", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "If you're looking for a restaurant that is warm, welcoming, and filled with happy people, then do NOT come here. For a name like Cafe Gratitude, I expected all of the above but to our disbelief, my friend and I experienced the complete opposite. We were so surprised and shocked. We picked this restaurant because it is plant based and they have 4.5 stars on Yelp but the service and food were terrible. For the food, we may have just picked the wrong dishes and the service could have been an off day but both were enough for us to never step foot in a Cafe Gratitude ever again. Our waitress was lifeless, uninterested, looked bored, and didn't even crack a smile. When she asked if we've been here before, I said, \"No and we're from LA\" (Cafe Gratitude originated in the Los Angeles area). She didn't even respond...so if she didn't care for my answer then why ask in the first place?We ordered Dynamic, Sensational, and a smoothie (Fruitiful). Dynamic and Sensational both have spaghetti squash. The descriptions sounded delicious but when our food arrived, we both thought it was just okay but after eating more, it just tasted so gross. Immediately walking out the door, I wanted to throw up. The spaghetti squash was soggy, mushy, and nasty - NOT what it is supposed to be if you make it right! I will always eat all my food, even when it's not good because I believe in not being wasteful but it was so bad that I just had to stop. The smoothie was good because honestly, how can you mess that up?I'm really sorry to say but we wouldn't recommend this place. And there's also a sense of prejudice in the air here too. I thought it was just me but when I told my friend how I felt, she said she felt the same way. So I guess if you're not white, even more of a reason to not come."}, {"review_id": "I2lvU-MdjDj_xMZ-2WSn6w", "user_id": "awvS9_zhu92BCjweUu3q9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "This was such a GEM to find in Kansas City during a recent trip!Their menu is expansive and makes other vegan restaurant's menus pale in comparison.

Hey, I'm not complaining since I needed a break from all the meat that I've been consuming in this BBQ-filled city.Everything here is plant-based, but all the dishes are still extremely flavor-packed and filling - I had \"nacho cheese\" (the healthy kind) potatoes and a pesto polenta that I ended up taking back to my hotel for leftovers. I also had a turmeric milk latte as a \"nightcap,\" which was a perfect way to end my evening.The quirk of ordering at Cafe Gratitude isn't so prevalent here (\"I'm [insert the name of your dish here]\"), but it's still fun to hear your order being called out as \"[Server name], you're [name of dish]\" - it's a little uplifting to hear compliments thrown out, as shallow as they are.For real, if you want a break from meat, Cafe Gratitude is the way to do it.

Seriously!!! We purposely made KC a part of our drive home because of my husband's experience here a few months back. I've recently found that my autoimmune body thrives and vegan and GF fare! This place and the menu has totally inspired me to continue learning about cooking with vegan flare. We had rose water lemonade and as an aromatherapist I was in love from the start! Daughter had the xoxo and the ginger was so warming it did make you cozi! Dinner, the fulfilled Mac and cheese...Don't forget to dig deep into the center for an amazing nutty cream. SOoo good and taste approved by a tween deprived of Mac and cheese for dairy! Next up, the warm hearted with polenta on top of a bed of spaghetti squash and vegetables with basil and ricotta (vegan) drizzle. Amazing doesn't even cover it! Hubs had the CMT which was cool and refreshing after a week of food on the road. The greens for the salad were so refreshing! Then dessert...Oh wow. Take me to heaven! Chocolate almond cheesecake, and tiramisu...Vegan!!!!! Oh how I've missed desserts! And of course we took home a cookbook for more inspiration and ideas for home!

I am warm-hearted. Well, maybe not, but that's what I was supposed to say when ordering the Warm-Hearted. Each dish and drink is named a positive adjective so when you order, you're encouraged to say \"I am {insert adjective here}.\" Then when you're served, your server says \"You are {adjective}.\" It's pretty cute. Anyway, the Warm-Hearted was scrumptious: perfectly firm pesto polenta over saucy spaghetti and spinach (alliteration unintended). I originally had concerns about whether it would fill me up but I was totally stuffed afterwards. Also highly recommend the Present (bruschetta) to start.Great atmosphere, great service, and great mission. They pride themselves on being a 100% organic plant-based restaurant and the menu and website also brag about the good they're doing for the community and environment. As the name denotes, they emphasize gratitude, which I also really appreciate. Example: \"What are you grateful for?\" is inscribed at the bottom of a lot of their plates. :)"}, {"review_id": "KMiMHX3PlpuBq8Wyi0N_Pw", "user_id": "Nc9WbZq06NmR0_zSaZF7Pg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "I've had an absolutely delightful time here today!

And I'm not gonna lie, I was thinking \"this place better be good if I'm freaking walking there in this heat\" the whole way there. It did not disappoint.I walked in and I really loved the way the restaurant looked although it was on the smaller side - no biggie. We didn't wait very long until we were seated but once we were a very friendly waitress started helping us. I wish I could remember her name but all I remember is that she was super friendly, helpful and had a smile on her face the whole time. So that really set the entire mood for our visit.The menu was pretty exciting because almost every single thing on it wanted to find its way into my mouth! (Maybe I was just really hungry from the walk? IDK) Anyway, after looking at the menu and wanting every thing, it was time to come back to reality and order so I got the \"I am Humble\". This is an Indian Curry bowl and I still remember having dreams about it - it was so good. It was a pretty decent sized portion and the food itself was extremely flavorful and delicious! I really, really liked the touch of the sweet tamarind sauce on top.To drink I had the \"I am Refreshed\" and y'all, listen to me, that was the best freaking lemonade I've had in a really long time! It was so refreshing, fresh and perfectly sweet.I don't know if I will ever find myself in Kansas City again but if I do my behind is heading over here again."}, {"review_id": "scFbLo9DYd6Uj6NVDrSDVA", "user_id": "mtNs0hw2o9hXKVFJC4nZcQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "I am not a vegetarian or vegan but was visiting KC and came here one day for lunch. Ordered the tostadas and veggie burger. I really enjoyed the tostadas and the salsa verde sauce was great. I split it with my sister and it was nice appetizer for both of us. I thought the veggie burger was alright. It tasted fine but there wasn't really anything special about it or the toppings to make it crave it again. I did put the salsa verde from the tostadas on the burger and it definitely amped up the taste. To finish it off I ordered a blueberry (and cardamom?) doughnut. It looked so good, yet tasted so bad! Neither my sister or I could eat it. I took two bites, packed it to go and threw it away at home. It was too dense and chalky and I couldn't taste blueberry or any other flavor in the doughnut.But to be fair, I rarely order vegan desserts because I have yet to have a vegan dessert that comes anywhere close to tasting as good as its original counterpart, so I typically pass on vegan desserts. However, I couldn't help but order this thinking this will be the vegan dessert that's different. I was wrong. So proceed with caution in the dessert category here. Overall, I thought the place was fine and the main meal was good. I also enjoyed the setup of the establishment.
