In all seriousness, I didn't know vegan food TASTED LIKE THIS! When I think of vegan food I think no flavor and food tasting like dirt, but this was not the case. The food is so good that I am now considering going vegan! The combinations of spices and flavors is like having a party in my mouth and the way they prepare their tofu will have you thinking that you are eating meat. You have to try it! PS. Go in the day time because the location could seem a little sketchy to some."}, {"review_id": "E6-FOMftjPCivC-B2NtgnQ", "user_id": "EhWPugJIfXTlPnBP9RiaIg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "The internet brought me here and I'm elated that it did. The food looked great but it tasted even better. I called in 15 minutes ahead and said I wanted \"a large plate of everything.\" When I arrived I was greeted by Steve, who is friendly and radiant. He asked if I was vegan and I told him no (because I eat fish) lol. The sampler came with rice and beans (MMM!), collard greens (YASSS), vegan mac 'n cheese, beans mixed with coconut milk (I'm guessing? YUM), tofu mixed with jerk sauce (SAVORY!), and a few other things I can't mention because that's how blessed my plate was, I just had so many options. Honestly, I never appreciated what tofu could be until I came to this spot. He just really has a way of preparing the food, you know? I bought a large and was able to share with several co-workers. You definitely get all your money's worth and then some. I love that there is a restaurant like this in the city and I encourage everyone who has never tried veg to try out THIS veg food before you knock ALL veg food."}, {"review_id": "scl_-Kxb6-dh9QM13rltlQ", "user_id": "YLhQaH7MZHavpFaDf09Sww", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "This is bar far has some of the best plant based food I HAVE EVER HAD!!!

So glad we stopped in.They have two sizes of to go foil containers. The smaller one is about $11 and $14 for the larger one. I got a full lg sampler plate and my husband got the large curry.  I really enjoyed it.  All very flavorful.  The curry dish was a bit much with a really soft texture so next time he would mix it up and maybe get the sample. In the sampler I tried the bbq, mac and cheese, greens, quinoa, sweet sour, brown rice, and beans."}, {"review_id": "KzVPZZUCKAGHAUt_3S6Jzg", "user_id": "D9xebLZROuMJfBjO7AoF4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "I love this place.  I'll be here everyday and the chef is wise man who makes the food with love.  I came in and was the first customer and he shared some deep thoughts I appreciated it.  Food was five star too so that's always good.  Just look at it."}, {"review_id": "P-J2hj91ZGidILIWMPi3ZQ", "user_id": "5ab6c4xbdMJzvUY2vk-luA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Great vegan comfort food to say the least!

Stopped in looking for a hearty vegetarian meal and was not disappointed at all.Situated near the hospital, and therefore with a lot of hustle and bustle outside, the restaurant was truly a hidden gem. With two table booths and a small kitchen, it's an intimate spot to grab a bite to eat and a great place to take a box to go.I was blown away by the menu so I decided to get \"a little bit of everything,\" and i truly got a little bit of everything. From the mac & cheese, to the sweet and sour to the collard greens and bar-b-que, everything was unique and delicious. Some of the best mac I've ever had, and they won an award for it (on the wall, check it out) in 2012, but it still holds true today.A great gem for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike!"}, {"review_id": "pQE6m07hLHvTV-B_YA-_Vg", "user_id": "h_9EXoBTV43IRAwVQw38hw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/28/2018", "text": "Made the switch to a vegan lifestyle and decide to try this spot.

What a fantastic selection and taste of the foods! The menu was a little confusing as I had wanted to order in advance but it is more of a \"buffet\" style where everything is cooked and you just ask for what you want when you arrive depending on the menu options, which are on the board when you enter.I got a mix of everything and can highly recomend this place!

I came in for take out 20 min before they closed on a Monday, on my way traveling across the state. Because of this, they didn't have all of the offerings the began the day with, but they were more than happy to fix me up a big plate (sz medium, 12.95...at least a pound of food if not more) The serving size was generous and I easily could've made two meals out of it if it wasn't so delicious that I simply had to eat it all in one sitting. I'm gluten free, and was so happy to find out that they had food I could eat, all of it vegan. I got the BBQ curry (tofu with a rich tomato based sauce with a hint of sweetness) and the collard greens with rice. Super delicious meal that put a smile on my face during a 6 hour drive. If I'm in the area, I'll definitely be back."}, {"review_id": "NNVO8K4tfWBjEE8i9wx5Rg", "user_id": "irhsqAF1x_eSKyH41fNKlA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "Great Food...will be loved by Veggie and meat lovers too!!
