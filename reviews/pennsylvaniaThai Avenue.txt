The service and staff are fantastic, too. They are so warm and friendly, and even know us by name.  The outstanding food and service may be why Samuel L Jackson ate there not once but twice while he was in town filming a movie (we actually saw him the first time!)"}, {"review_id": "_gFFsSpL25ZkGGzIW1ERcw", "user_id": "3NCcqm1ZbsbuldzAof7Zxg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Ive had several dishes here and never disappointed.

I eat vegetarian and cannot have gluten. And there were MANY options. They were so accommodating that the waiter said any menu item that usually has soy could be made with tamari, thus making it gluten free. Their Thai iced tea is a huge portion and delicious as well as the food. It's BYOB, which means we can enjoy our own alcoholic beverages and save some $$.

Have stopped by for both lunch and dinner and have been satisfied on both my visits. The service is friendly and efficient. The food has been great on both occasions. I have had the red curry, panang curry and basil fried rice with the basil fried rice being my favorite. The only reason I am docking a star is because in my opinion, the dinner options are overpriced. You can order the exact same food and get the same quantity at lunch for nearly half the price.

The one star rating is for the disrespected what we been treated. The food there was pricey and the taste just okayyy and there is nothing to surprise you. The attitude of the waiter was so rude and unprofessional. They saw that we were a group of Chinese and they just seemed like they didn't want to take our business. When we first arrived they told us there would be a long wait and told us to come back in 30min. So we did come back in 30 minutes later, but they just ignored us and let everyone else that came after sit in before we did. IS IT BECAUSE WE ARE ASIANS SO WE ARE NOT WORTH YOUR SERVICE?!?! Stop being racist and close this fucking scam place. All other comments on yelp are prob paid to be posted. DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE EVER!!!!
