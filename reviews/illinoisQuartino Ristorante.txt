This restaurant has a very cozy Italian vibe. You do not necessarily have to dress up to go here. Went out with coworkers for a night out in Chicago and it didn't disappoint. We got different kind of pasta, all is very good. I got their amazing risotto and their red sauce pasta, with very tender meat. The sauce was very rich! They have a very good list of wine - when in doubt, ask! The dessert is really the stars here! Do not miss the Italian donuts as they are my favorite! Will definitely come back! Remember to make a reservation before you come though, as it seems to be very crowded, but I have seen people just walked in and they had to wait for quite some time. Very fun experience! Don't hesitate!!"}, {"review_id": "GgMNhbndg3b3ur_o3dRYCA", "user_id": "_TqJ4hnIIQog7-I0_RcbVw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "The food was SO good. Tapas Italian style done right. We made reservations on a Tuesday night around 7p and the restaurant was bustling. The dining area is large but the tables are very close to each other, the only qualm I had was that I kept bumping the lady sitting at the table next to me. The service was quick and our server was very knowledgable and pointed us to the popular dishes and her favorites. She did not lead us astray. The wine menu was extensive...there is a wine on there for everyone!The food menu additionally was just as extensive with small to medium sized tapas and pizzas. They first bring out some fresh, warm bread which we dipped in olive oil that we mixed with freshly grated parmesan cheese and fresh cracked black pepper. SO GOOD. We then ordered the brussel sprouts, caprese salad, fried calamari, and stuffed dates with panchetta to start off with. Brussel sprouts - perfectly cooked with outer charred crisp with a very smoky flavor - very good.Caprese salad - tomatoes, mozzarella and basil with balsamic drizzle - pretty hard to mess this up honestly, I wish there was more mozzarella to tomato ratio.Fried calamari - another classic that was very good paired with a spicy red sauce. Stuffed dates - easily the best thing we ordered, creamy gorgonzola stuffed wrapped with pancetta and drizzled with sweet honey = perfect flavor explosion. We then ordered the Rucolina pizza with prosciutto, fresh arugula and freshly grated parmesan cheese. The crust was thin and crunchy. It was lacking a bit in the flavor department, I think more garlic could have done the trick. But it was a good pizza overall!Overall, the experience was pleasant. If I am back in the area, I would go again. I would probably try more of the pizzas and get a couple orders of the stuffed dates because YUM."}, {"review_id": "uLzw7LoGrSXo4yIlmXOf_A", "user_id": "TvOwopkAJDtZQ0fUVgkF_w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "I was in this neighborhood on a recent Friday evening.

I'm guessing we had a reservation, but I'm not sure.

If only they make pasta this good in the Bay Area!On our first night in Chicago, we decided to grab bite close to the hotel so we decided to go here. The wait was about 1.5 hours at 9:30PM on a Thursday so my coworker and I decided to grab a drink at a Red Head Piano (they have the BEST OLD FASHIONS) since it was close by.Here is what we order: (No star rating needed since they are all 5 stars)- San Daniele Pizza ($16): prosciutto, wild arugula and grana- SO GOOD! It was topped off with some lemon so the citrus balance out the salty prosciutto and grana cheese. MMM! Thinking about it is making me hungry.-Burrata ($10.75): in house made burrata with roasted beets salad. OMG! It's so simple but so freaking delicious!-Linguine with Clams ($11.75): I always ordered linguini with clams at most Italian restaurants but this place definetly takes the cake. Al dente pasta bathing in that sweet clam broth! MMMM!Quartino easily made it to my top three favorite Italian restaurant. I don't know if its because I haven't eaten anything all day since I flew in that afternoon and then was busy setting up the tradeshow or it was because the 4 old fashions I had at the bar that helped enhance my taste buds.

Service to me is EVERYTHING and this place under delivered. Came on a Saturday afternoon and it was steady but NOT slammed. Waited 15 minutes for our waitress to come to us and then we were rushed to order. Our waitress also was VERY dismissive and borderline rude. Like she did not want us to eat there or something or maybe she just hated her job. Frankly that isn't my problem, if you don't like your job then QUIT! I was going to ask her what her deal was but I didn't want to risk any funky business with my food. I went with the basics, Fettuccini Alfredo and MAN was I disappointed. I have never tasted anything that bland in my entire life. I am not even over exaggerating (and we all know I love to do that) but it was miserable. It was so miserable that I asked them to bring me seasoned salt. I dumped the salt on the Alfredo and it got better but I was just turned off that they had the audacity to serve this at an Italian restaurant. The reason we came here was because it always looks busy so we thought the food bust be amazing but NEGATIVE. I don't know what to say, I know I can't take back the gross taste I had in my mouth when I tried the Alfredo. Now we all know I am a fair human being! If service was top notch I would've tried to convince myself to try them again and order something different but service sucked balls.Definitely will not be coming back."}, {"review_id": "eH9ImJl51z1W1eXcIJ4q1Q", "user_id": "zQT4EcwqpPU4OfaUQuI_Ow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "One of my all time favorite restaurants in Chicago.I love everything and anything about this place- from the Italian ambiance to the out of this world food. After visiting a couple of cities in Italy last year, I came back to Chicago on a mission to find a restaurant that would mimic the type of food I had there.. and I'm telling you guys- everything at Quartino reminds me of Italy. My absolute favorite pizzas here are the Quattro formaggi (4 cheese) and the Rucolina (fresh wild arugula). They are simply out of this world, so sooo sooooo good. Ambrosial in every way. My favorite pasta here is the tortellini with Alfredo pasta with peas! Tastes like a replica of the ones I had in Italy. You also have to try the olive selection and pastrami! I also love the vibe here, very rustic but chic. The waiters aren't that friendly, but the food and ambiance of the restaurant makes up for it.

Chicago is gifted with so many good Italian restaurants .. we were walking around the magnificent mile when our tummy started growling. After seeing so many good reviews for this place, we wanted to enjoy it for ourselves. We walked in without reservations for lunch, and was promptly seated. This place did not disappoint! The menu is largely tapa style but I really enjoyed its fresh aesthetic. We got the lunch special that allowed you to generously pick an appetizer, a pasta, and a seafood/meat of your choice from the menu WITHOUT restrictions (none of that prix fix business). We also added on a burrata and a veal slider, as the lunch was designed to be shared amongst two people and we felt it wouldn't be enough to satiate us. The appetizers were all great. Got the dates wrapped in pancetta and it was delicious, albeit slightly oilier than I anticipated. Really enjoyed the contrast of the sweet and soft dates with the crispy and salty pancetta. Veal sliders were also good but I think one can never go wrong with veal. The burrata was to die for IMO! My partner felt it was a bit flavorless but when you sprinkle the slightest amount of salt and pepper, it hit the spot so well. The cheese was fresh fresh fresh and it was so creamy and rich. MmmMm! We got the gnocchi as our pasta order and it was excellent although I felt it was a bit too hard/chewy for me to render it exceptional. I guess I like my gnocchi a bit softer .. but the pesto sauce that drenched the gnocchi was great, although I did wish it had a stronger basil flavor. The octopus was also excellent and featured a gentle balsamic vinaigrette typical of many Mediterranean dishes. Overall, would I return? Definitely - there were plenty of other dishes to try and, if the beginning was this good, I can only imagine how the entire menu is. Highly recommend if you're in the area!"}, {"review_id": "TpOFIdu0uRKPKkRpzD1JeA", "user_id": "izxgHZIMWe331_W_lEvXhA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "All the food are good 5/5Reasonable price 5/5Take reservation for even group of 14!Amazing place to hang outThe thing is they don't allow to split bills I love my pasta so much will go back again and again!"}, {"review_id": "j8lck5AMhS1EYgkaS2HLmQ", "user_id": "1LIf1KxsMpwXSUMrEDQGog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "We had a work dinner here- reservations for 17.

It was definitely packed inside and we were likely only able to get seating because we had made prior reservations. Good sign. A lot of people coming here must mean the food is good right?ATMOSPHERE/ARCHITECTURE: 8/10This place has a homey, classic feel to it, utilizing a lot of dark wood to set the ambience. There is always some old Italian movie playing in the background and apparently Al Capone and his crew used to hang around here back in the 1920s/30s. The restaurant is large and has a lot of seating. Easily 150+ and that is a conservative estimate. It was a little bit packed and tight for space in my opinion, but that just means it is doing very well.SERVICE : 3/10They were very busy but that is no excuse for the handful of marred mistakes that were made that were actually pretty big. We had ordered a birthday cake for a friend and it was supposed to come with a candle. No candle. Strike one. I ordered braised pork shank which I will get into later and it said it comes with organic vegetables. No vegetables. Strike two. And lastly, one our friends was struck with a bill double what it should have been at the end. Luckily she was immediately take aback and asked about it before realizing it was a mistake and it was a double charge, but this is a pretty grave mistake. Strike three.FOOD: 8/10Braised Pork Shank - First off, WHERE were the organic vegetables?! I would have entirely forgotten about this until someone at my table mentioned that it was supposed to come with some organic vegetables. Disappointed. However, the braised pork shank is FANTASTIC. The meat is cooked to perfect tenderness so that it falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. The flavor is really perfect to me. Not too salty. Some might find it a bit bland but I think it was seasoned exactly as I wanted. HIGHLY recommended. Just ask for the vegetables next time.D'Anitra Pizze - Pizza with duck prosciutto which is cured in house with onion and wild agugula. The pizza overall was really good. Very authentic Italian style pizza that is different from a lot of the Americanized offerings in Chicago.Pouilly-Fuisse White Wine - Very smooth clear tasting wine that had a little tartness to it. I thought this was a very good white wine and good choice for someone who wants something a little sweeter and lighter.Gavi DOCG del Comune White Wine - Very similar to the Pouilly-Fuisse except with less tartness and also less sweetness. I thought it was good was well but preferred the Pouilly-Fuisse over this one.PROBABILITY OF RETURN: 6/10I would definitely consider returning here to try other food options. The things that they had were very good. Just turned away by some hit or miss service problems.TO EAT OR NOT TO EAT: The food is good.

The cavatelli was pretty normal, but the sauce was tasty with just the right bit of tartness from the tomatoes. The meatballs were great -- soft, peppery and flavorful. Just as I was eating this the server was explaining to the table behind me that everything at this restaurant was designed to be shared... whoops! As I dined for one AND got a dessert. I got the hot chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream. Great vanilla bean ice cream, could taste that the ice cream was not artificially flavored at all but made with vanilla bean which I appreciated. BUT EVEN GREATER HOT CHOCOLATE CAKE. It was melty and dense and wow what a great little cake. I ate the entire thing so it got a bit sweet at the end with the chocolate sauce and everything but for the first 7/8ths of it was the greatest thing and greatest mood booster on earth. Definitely the cure to all bad days. Would come back for this cake.

I have to guess that tourists love it, but the food could be better. Also, it was incredibly hot in the main dining area. I don't know if it was just an off night, but it made for an uncomfortable dining experience. Fondue: who doesn't love a cheese fondue? The cheese itself is delicious, but the bread that it comes with is super tough. Each bite is like trying to rip through what could only be described as 10-day old bread. It's dry and tasteless and impossible to eat. I ended up using the regular bread that comes to every table. Burrata: part of the burrata was really tasty, but half of this burrata was tough and doughlike, making it hard to even cut into, which is not typical of most burrata. I've never seen anything like it, but it wasn't good. The beets were fresh and tasty. Gnocchi: it's okay. The pesto sauce is tasty, but it doesn't leave you craving more.Tortellini: this dish is delicious. The alfredo sauce is perfectly creamy and cheesy, and the prosciutto tastes fresh and pairs nicely. Favorite dish on the menu -- you should definitely order this one.Beef short rib: tender, flavorful. This was good. The service was fine throughout the night. The space is beautiful. There are two levels, and the interior is nicely decorated. I can see why it's a tourist hot spot, but there are so many better Italian places here in Chicago.

At our lunchtime visit today, the service was spot on. The hostess gave us a warm welcome as she seated us in the bright porch area. Our waiter, whose name I didn't catch but he had cool glasses, was attentive and friendly from the start. Also, I was impressed with two visits from important looking men (owners? managers?) who came to check in with us during our meal. Really, the service couldn't have been better. We ended up getting the weekday lunch special - $25 for a three course meal for two. Now, it's important to remember that these are small plates we're talking about here. We started with the pancetta wrapped figs with gorgonzola and honey. They were rich but pretty tasty. Next we moved on to the cavatelli pasta. This was my favorite dish of the day. Italian simplicity at its best. We ended with the shrimp. My advice would be to avoid this dish. It was teeny tiny and tasted fishy to me. We did order a pepperoni/sausage pizza too for the kids and it was delicious. I think the next time, I would opt for a couple of different pizzas and a couple glasses of wine. What irked me about our meal was the $5.50 charge on a small side of plain spaghetti. I'm talking small, like 4-5 ounces at most. I mean, c'mon now. That's just crazy.

As luck would have it, our server was a vegan and was able to provide me with an exhaustive list of all their vegan items as well as some veganizable entrees the kitchen could throw together for me.  I opted for the White Bean and Garlic Spread and substituted raw veggies instead of the Toasted Filone - which was freaking delicious by the way.  We also opted for some delightful beverages, of which I can no longer remember our selections.  The manager actually came out to chat with us on account of my husband's Astros cap (right after the Astros won the World Series) and ended up hooking us up with a free orange sorbet, which was quite thoughtful and appreciated.  Our following two trips occurred within two hours of one another, one right before the dinner rush (and boy does it get crazy up in here on the weekends!) and then after.  I just had the minestrone soup and some wine, but the husband could not get enough of the pasta.  I don't think I had seen him this overjoyed over food in quite awhile to be quite frank.
