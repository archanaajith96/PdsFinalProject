When a dining establishment has 99.9% positive reviews and there are numerous of them, then why bother - just say \"I concur\"!But I guess I should say something about Epi's - the food was excellent (I had the lamb chops, my wife had the steak medallions both cooked to perfection) yet as wonderful as the food was, it was outstripped by the service!!!!! The waitstaff at Epi's could be serving water in leaking cardboard cups and would give them 5 stars. Everyone we came in contact was well informed, extremely friendly and over the top helpful in making our dining experience something to remember.That's it folks - don't miss this place in downtown Meridian."}, {"review_id": "hVB2WgVrZAVQhEY0YVxyLQ", "user_id": "uGWYBQN3hNsKW7Bn4Tu4FQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/12/2017", "text": "Do yourself a favor and make reservations to check this place out!  Located in a house that gives a cozy vibe with service that treats you like family.  Basque food at it's best!PROS:  Where to start?  Service, atmosphere, food...all outstanding and compared to none in the Treasure Valley.  The calamari is the best I've ever had..and I don't even like Calamari.  Sauteed mushrooms?  Just say yes and enjoy the garlicky goodness as it swarms your taste buds. Entrees?  Pick any and you won't be disappointed.  My fav is the cod!  If they have a special entree available, usually it's amazing so don't hesitate to order it.  Dessert?  Green Apple Bread Pudding that will sooth your soul and belly in ways you didn't know it needed soothing.The service and staff is always friendly and professional, treating you like family.  Snappy on the refills and clean up but not obnoxiously hovering or glaring.  They also have really good stories if they feel so inclined to share.  I won't even both listing a \"CONS\" section because there are none.A Few Notes: Make reservations.  The prices are on the higher side but you do receive high quality food and service and charging less would be an insult to the establishment.  Also expect to have your meal served at a slower place than most restaurants. It's an experience to be here, so don't expect everything out in 10 minutes or less.  Enjoy the wine and savor the flavors as you dine here and don't rush it.Overall, Epi's is outstandingly delicious place to dine for a unique basque experience!"}, {"review_id": "48lMAwhU8dyq3E5g8uF0xg", "user_id": "P4TEXMWAFZkQjcZ4-Or6fg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I don't know if I have ever been in a more welcoming restaurant.  We walked in the door to a place that was totally full.

The people that worked here were asses. Garbage on the floor and also there was a toddler throwing a fit and screaming its head off and no body said a damn word.  This carried on for 15 damn minutes. I am never coming back here again.The people here gave me dirty looks. I asked for soup and it was cold. I told them i want the soup hot and they said that they don't have hot soup. So i asked for her to heat it up in the microwave and she said she couldn't and i asked why. She said no because the manager can only use it.

Do you enjoy friendly and knowledgable servers? Do you crave croquetas? Then get to Epi's. I had the pleasure of checking out this local institution with some friends for the holidays. Our server informed us they are booked through the new year and I understand why! There are plenty of smiles and plenty of shared plates to go around the table at Epi's. We shared a giant bottle of Eguren wine. It was a smooth, delightful Basque wine. Ham croquetas were best I've ever had and the calamari was tender. Not a bit rubbery! If they have the mushroom soup on offer, get it. Firm mushrooms with a zippy white pepper finish. Delicious!!My husband and I shared the grilled chicken and the special: sole wrapped in shrimp and baked in a lemon butter sauce. The chicken was tasty but not too memorable. The fish was delectable. Would order again. Such a pleasant experience. I'll be headed back to Epi's for another special occasion very soon. It's a pricier restaurant, so not fit for most people on just an average day. But well worth the price for a unique experience."}, {"review_id": "ADcAoKPH5ML44ECgXFnwrQ", "user_id": "EZqaO-PBYUUuueBtPhVoRg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We have eaten here several times now.  I was wowed the first few times.  It is quaint and friendly but last time (and every time) our entrees were nothing to brag about.  I spent $32 on dry, awful Halibut.  Surely it was frozen.   My wife had scallops that were in a very unremarkable sauce.  Of course the salad is a small bowl of iceburg lettuce.  Bread is very good and wine selection small but very good.  To me it is not worth it.I doubt we will visit there for a while but hardly think our opinion will impact the restaurant.  Clean place, great service, and overrated IMHO."}, {"review_id": "Xih2iGxzyEyYrJJCYN9SfA", "user_id": "8G4GnrRpTuh4YAmT8NuWTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/9/2017", "text": "There are not enough positive adjectives to do this restaurant justice.

They get in a great selection of seafood here.  I had croquettas, clam chowder, a butter fish for dinner, and green apple bread pudding.  The croquettas had a delicious flavor; however, I'm a meat eater and it was mostly filling with less than a tiny tiny bite of meat. If they could add more meat to this, it would be perfect for me.  The clam chowder was delicious- I would definitely order it again.  The butter fish was super delicate fish and buttery. The green apple pudding- this is something that can not be skipped. It's sooo delicious. Perfect flavors.  You have to call at least a week in advance for reservations- no last minute dining here.

The service is stellar, and the food is great too. But the bread pudding is what keeps my husband and I coming back to Epi's.

A few times my husband and I have split an entree so that we can each have our own bread pudding. However, it's definitely large enough to share and we usually wish that we had. You won't regret coming to dinner here, as long as you save some room for the BREAD PUDDING! Did I mention, it's all home made, including the Carmel sauce that's drizzled on top?!

The roasted red peppers that top lamb or fish are new from scratch, as Ami's the salad dressing and soups. Save room for the gloriously decadent Gateau Basque, a custard stuffed cheesecake that absolutely melts the taste buds. So glad I saved room for that. Epi is wise enough to offer some of their favorite dishes in \"lighter fare\" so that you can indulge in specialty appetizers(like chorizos in homemade pimientos, ham croquettes) and  the delectable desserts ( hers also Basque flan as well as famed rice pudding). Not an inexpensive place, but memorable- well worth it.
