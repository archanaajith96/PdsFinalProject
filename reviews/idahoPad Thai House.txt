We paid $40 total. Cha Yor was very tasty. Meat was a bit salty but the texture was great and it complemented the lettuce wraps. Pad Kra Pao was okay; probably not comparable to the ones I've tried in Seattle. But the Kang Leung Curry was bomb! Servers were very polite too. I would definitely go back!"}, {"review_id": "9ejD-Xp_H3uOcqVKgrxR0w", "user_id": "t2XuJjp_h9aRn-8ANoyc_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Mic drop....amazing... all of it (that I have had thus far!)

That being said I will only get my food to go(10 - 15min wait), the wait is horrible sometimes up to 30 min. then you look around and there are several empty tables. The staff has always treated me with the utmost respect. The only negative comment I would say about this place is there spice level is never the same. One time you ask for #2 spice and it lights your tongue on fire the next time you as for #2 and it has no spice at all.I would suggest getting your spice level consistent and getting more staff for your busy times."}, {"review_id": "0eRGss5eEAXHx1GGnw5rAA", "user_id": "DFeH0lTI5CYmQ4sEJYXGNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/7/2017", "text": "First Thai place tried in Boise! Pleasantly surprised. Ordered a Pho Noodle Soup (seafood) and seafood fried rice and shrimp fresh rolls. - can you tell I love seafood -This is the first Thai place I've been to that brings you wonton chips to your table! They were lightly coated with sugar; it was a nice to munch on something before our food came.The sauce of the fresh rolls was really watery but other than that, they tasted fresh. The seafood fried rice was also loved by my family. We were full so we took it to go.  My soup was full of shrimp, mussels, calamari and even crab legs! Good selection of Thai food too. Try if you're in the area and want a wide selection!"}, {"review_id": "XKBTixIcKPQaf_T9cWlwLA", "user_id": "JJPOxvgQLvZ6Ke-PLpkE4A", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Oh how the mighty has fallen... We've been going to the pad Thai house for twelve years now, as it has become a favorite. We've moved farther and farther away, but still were more than happy to make the long drive. Not any more, though We've slowly lost all of the wait staff we grew to love - who Are all these new faces? Then there is the problem of dirty plates/silverware/tea pots. And What happened to portion size?? When you order the spicy lettuce wrap app for two, it would be Nice to actually feel like you can share it. This time around, it was maybe half the usual size. And heat??!! We asked for the hottest, '4 peppers' on everything, and Nothing was even the tiniest bit hot. Nothing. And last of all, but certainly not least, we were seated by the 'host' and waited, watched another table get seated shortly after us, they received their salads, and drinks. We waited. And waited. And finally the host came over to us to take our order. After the host brought our drinks and salad out (other table had dinner already) we told him that we would like to just have him take care of us the rest of the evening and receive the tip as well, since we Never did see our waitress. Looks like Tom is your only redeeming quality. So long, Pad Thai House. It was a good twelve years.

Luckily we arrived around 11:45am, prior to the lunch rush which started probably around 12:15pm. Great service our entire stay -Pad Thai Lunch Special ($6.95): What a steal for the price! You still get such a good amount of food along with a bowl of soup to get you started. The hot and sour soup was extremely salty but it was free so I can't complain much. The noodles for the pad thai are thinner than i've seen at other Thai restaurants but it wasn't bad.Pad Thai House is located in the corner of a plaza - ample amount of parking even during prime time."}, {"review_id": "o3WsaZA_dNoNlzXQlgICNg", "user_id": "EfGPXR9zev0DGybF-YJmig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "came in here during the lunch rush- just an FYI, they are super busy in the middle of the day so plan accordingly!the service was slow.

I would eat that any day of the week, especially if I was sick! note to self for further reference on that one.I left so full and satisfied with this place, I can't wait to come back again. also, since I was alone I was watching other plates come out and everything looked delicious! they have quite an extensive chinese selection as well, (kung pao, orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, chow mein, fried rice..guess people don't understand what thai food is! it all looked great though i will say!)I will most definitely be back, and likely soon! thank you!"}, {"review_id": "sYS_KgnDdUuRUDpn1ElbnQ", "user_id": "lv1jikT8ltedHUywvCFbrQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite places in Boise.

Once the staff found out that I never had been there before they all let me know that they'd help me pick out dishes that I would like. I am really impressed. I went an hour before closing time and they were busy still! I think this place is a hidden gem.
