Very clean, nice staff, attentive, and well priced. If I had any advice to them, it would be to get more restrooms, although I understand it could be an issue of space, still so many people in one place at one time with crammed restrooms is never good. Raramente le doy 5 estrellas, así que sabes que este lugar es bueno. Muy limpio, agradable personal, atento y bien de precio. Si tuviera algún consejo para ellos, sería para obtener más baños, aunque entiendo que podría ser un problema de espacio, todavía tantas personas en un solo lugar a la vez con baños abarrotados nunca es bueno."}, {"review_id": "geFKNC9eew7EhsikGTuMoA", "user_id": "KDuWv96lLrfkKQ-4KtaU8w", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "I was told by a big breakfast eater that this was his number 1 spot for breakfast and I had to check it out. That Ogie's Cafe is so darn good and filling that he dined here 4x in the last couple of weeks. Four times!!!!! In 2 weeks!!!!! And the reviews on here seem to agree. Unfortunately, I think it's all hype once again. Boo.On the outside, the restaurant looks very old and dirty, but once you step inside, the place is huge and very well kept! If you've dined at \"Jim's Restaurant,\" it's very similar here. Older crowd, mom and pop shop feel, timeless photos from back in the day. Servers come by pretty often to refill your coffee and water. They even offer their favorites and recommendations. Well.....I'm stubborn and always decide a good breakfast spot based on their chicken fried steak, so I ordered that instead. Although the customer service is on point, the food....ehh. Not so much.It took about maybe 20 minutes to get our food. No biggie, but it also wasn't too busy. The chicken fried steak and my hash browns were a little burnt/over cooked. It wasn't chicken fried steak, but breaded cubed steak (Insert Conceited's face). Maybe that should've been a red flag when I saw it on the menu, but I still had to go for it. Their pancakes are really big! Like flipping on the side of your plate big, but it's a big fluff and a little burnt on one side. Probably wouldn't be back here anytime soon. Servers are extremely nice, the food can be better."}, {"review_id": "YrxxYxzRJZdzdRJh1hvv2g", "user_id": "h8JykH6XZqIfRnGxPzQp7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Fast service and great food!

The restaurant was crowded but the staff was friendly and upbeat. We got there with the Sunday morning rush. We had a bit of a wait but everybody was friendly. The waitress took our order and the coffee kept coming. This is your basic hole in the wall restaurant with lots of history and family. We got our basic staples of eggs, corn beef hash, and hash browns. The food came fast and was great.  This is a definite repeat.

I enjoy all the food and the staff is awsome. Thanks for 30 years of great food, hope there is many more years to come.  I enjoy the burritos and Special Breakfast all the time. They have great food for a reasonable prices.Please make sure you try this place if you have not.  Try the Ogie's Special Burrito, Ogie's Special Breakfast or the Ogie's skillet.  They are awesome, you will be full when you leave.  Lunch is very good here.  Try one of the lunch specials of the day. All the soups are truly home made and not from a can.This is a family run Diner that deserves to be on Guy's Dinner, Drive-in & Dine.  Post comments to Food Network, if you find the place Triple D worthy.  I have!  It is an unusually place like no other one in Utah. A great family to get to know, they are friendly. The owner has three daughter that work here, they are very good.  All the staff are great to help you with your dining experience while you are there.  Saturdays and Sunday are very busy times at this dinner, service is quick, so worth the wait for a table or a seat at the counter."}, {"review_id": "WrOV0t0kTaizSMTl20HQzQ", "user_id": "JeNqbhvEeTVHU0bU2yOekw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "This just one of my favorite places to have breakfast in Utah.
