I went there for lunch today and had the most wonderful experience. Every single item I ordered from the green and beans soup (kale, chickpeas, carrot, and celery in a delicious broth), buffalo tempeh grilled cheese sandwich, peanut butter banana smoothie, and lastly... the chocolate chip cookie was incredible! Everything was super tasty and the best part is that I didn't feel disgustingly full or nauseous after eating all that. I'm not vegan but I am certainly considering a dairy free diet after having such a pleasant experience at The Red Fern. There are so many other items I wanted to try on the menu. I will definitely return!"}, {"review_id": "iGDbHVlSkNXQeJzYWbzSow", "user_id": "VqCx0LwYmrT7NE1P_mU9mA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Being a vegetarian, I look forward to trying new vegan places all the time! Instead of having a few vegan options on the menu, THE ENTIRE MENU WAS VEGAN (I don't think the physical menu was edible, but hey, you never know!). I was pleased by the menu - so many options! Unfortunately, the food itself was extremely average...maybe even below average to some. Tasted good, but not great.

My fiancé went inside to pick up my order because the parking situation was not ideal (not the restaurants fault, fair enough) so I hovered outside in the car with hazards on. I'd previously called to ask about portion sizes, daily specials, and to request my salad and meal be separated because my past experience with this restaurant was that of a limp, warm, and sad salad, which I assumed was due to it being pre mixed and packed beside the warm main course. I spoke to a girl named Devin or Devlin or something and ok she had a semi attitude on the phone, but, I'm a lifelong vegan and I've waitressed a lot so I assumed it was just maybe how she seems on the phone. WRONG. My poor fiancé stood there at the counter for TWENTY MINUTES (yes I timed it I'm pregnant and impatient nd I was HUNGRY AF)while she and other employees were apparently immersed in a conversation too profound and important to help him, in spite of the restaurant having ONE table of patrons and several staff in blatant view of my tall and overly polite future husband. My order was sitting on the counter and he contemplated simply grabbing it, as it was already paid for, but he didn't want to be rude in spite of the employees waving him off when he asked for assistance. So, I have eaten food from or at this place 3 times in the year I've lived in Rochester and I'm honestly surprised at all the positive reviews because at nearly every other vegan or vegan-friendly restaurant or bakery I've gone to (there's a lot) Red Fern was mentioned in a negative way. I guess they don't have great relationships with other restaurants or chefs, probably because this is a very expensive and uhm hipster-oriented place that has a weird air of exclusivity and a lot of their menu items are crazy and ok their decor is friggin random logs painted white and haphazardly strewn up, their food can be described as \"alternative and not for the faint of heart\" (beet cheesecake? With beet frosting? What?! 'Pickled things and such' 'pesto lemon tofu with extract of strawberry jam glazè' I'm serious, they are pushing it with this stuff.) The pricing is crazy too.. the things that actually are good tasting and recognizable (tofu egg sandwich) can end up costing $18 if you get the supposedly 'included side' (DONT EVEN TRY TO GET FRIES GURL THEY DO NOT HAVE SUCH THINGS) that is actually not free unless you want sesame sticks (no for real) and can range from $2.75-$4 for things like salad or mashed potatoes. God forbid you want some gravy on the 1/2 cup serving you get of potatoes (I'm petty and annoyed so yes I measured) because much like guacamole at Chipotle THAT IS AN EXTRA CHARGE B. Accept your dry mashed potato lump and be grateful. So where was I.. ok the desserts are decent and some are tasty- the tastiness is definitely dependent on whether the employee feels like giving you a fresh slice of cake or the random sad end remains of some long forgotten cake of yesteryear barely resembling what can be described as food. It's hurtful. Physically hurtful, to bite into the end corner small squished dry crackled nail polish looking frosting and cake that was presented to me. It messed up my mouth yo. Like I'm actually getting mad even reliving this and it just happened and I haven't even addressed the \"Mac and cheese\" that was TWELVE DOLLARS, cold, looked \"like falafel\" and tastes like it went sour. It's not right. The \"side salad\" ... ok I'm including a photo for this situation because this is just too messed up, like I can't even with this salad that looks like they literally threw four sprigs of lettuce and an old tomato in the container and shook it about until it cried. I feel cheated and robbed and I'm still hungry and don't eat here guys. Go to The Owl House, or Hetties Delights, or Misfits Donuts, or Get Caked, or Pi Craft, or Dogtown, or literally anywhere else but here. They are not nice and make me sad for vegans because their crappy attitude and weird sad food makes convincing my fiancé to try vegan food WAY MORE DIFFICULT. He's a chef. This restaurant has left us both confused and pained and poor. Want a refund. Will accept at least warning others against this BS."}, {"review_id": "Owf89CUGAOGtNNPOHP6USw", "user_id": "NDdZ_59o1wADZG73gWOZxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I used to go to the Red Fern when I was an omnivore and I really liked it. It was a cozy place to meet a friend for some healthier fare and they always had a small but nice beer selection. In the past year though I went vegan, and now I'm like \"Red Fern, take all my money.\" It is so nice to be able to go somewhere to eat and be able to order from a full menu of vegan options. The menu isn't huge but has a big enough of selection to keep you interested and there are always specials. Lately I have been opting for the kombucha on tap instead of the beer on tap. My favorite dishes there are the Warrior Wrap, the lentil burger, and the mac and cheese nachos with Buffalo tempeh, and the specials. I like that when I leave here I feel full and not gross from greasy food. My only complaint is that the choice of sides that come with dishes are either a field green salad or sesame sticks. If you want the potato salad, soup, mac salad, etc you have to pay an up charge. I don't really consider sesame sticks a side and who wants field greens? So this sucker is always paying for an upgrade. As others have mentioned, the parking situation is not really ideal, however I have just gone in with the mindset that I will have to park a little further away and will be enjoying a little stroll down Park Ave."}, {"review_id": "RM9tmHHoLgcvXklBcag5bg", "user_id": "KR5Ma7JrkiqMO9_vLrU9sw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "This restaurant really deserves it's rave reviews. I do not have a diet that resembles anything like a vegan's, I love my meat, but I had an awesome dinner. Thank you to my vegan friend for bringing me here! The restaurant is small but super cute. There is a dessert case right when you walk in (we'll get to the desserts later), they also have a bar area aside from the regular dining space. The interior is decorated with a lot of wood theme pieces which gives you that natural woodsy atmosphere. For apps we got the quesadilla. I think this dish was pretty good considering it was vegan cheese. The cheese was perfectly melty! I'm not sure what the fillings were, I believe they were mushrooms, but they had a nice savory flavor which complemented the cheese well.For entree my friend and I half and half-ed 2 sandwiches. One was the buffalo bleu and the other the steak bomb sandwich. The buffalo bleu's sandwich blew me away (pun totally intended). The flavor was amazing. There was the meaty texture and savory flavor from the tempeh and the tang from the sauce was so good. The bread was nice and thick and it was a type of bread I've never had before. What a winning combo of flavor and texture. It'd be hard not to get this sandwich again when I come back. The steak bomb was pretty good also. The mushrooms had a really nice deep flavor. It was served between the same type of bread. This sandwich didn't have tang to it, it really does resemble a beef dish. I also had the tomato basil soup as my side. Oh gosh was this soup good. It was creamy but without the cream! You can really taste the tomato and the herbiness was really nice. Love!For drinks and dessert I had the kombucha wine, tiramisu cake and cheesecake. The wine was ok, it tasted a bit watered down but I thought it was interesting to try so I did. It has a subtle taste and you can't really tell there is any kombucha in there. The tiramisu cake was interesting. The sponge is not smooth but rather had chunks of something in it. I wasn't a fan of the sponge but the frosting was really good! It was soft and velvety but honestly the whole cake did not remind me of tiramisu. The cheesecake was actually really good, especially with the raspberry (or strawberry??) sauce. It was smooth and had a nice tang to it. The desserts are a little pricey but it's an amazing treat for anyone who can't have dairy!I'm very glad to have tried the Red Fern and will definitely be back for more sandwiches and one of those giant cookies!"}, {"review_id": "AHpRON4LJcDWOKyjQKurTg", "user_id": "nkY11VBQ-LuTBEtXHjfbGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "came here to say this place is amazing and you can't leave without ordering dessert.

My hubby and I each had a glass of wine and bowls of the soup du jour (tomato basil, which rivals any other tomato soup I've ECER eaten).

This place is amazing and has some awesome vegan and gluten free options.  We went for lunch on Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately.  The service was excellent and did not take long, especially considering it was the middle of a weekend lunch rush. My bf and I both ordered the compost plate, their vegan version of Rochester's famous garbage plate. I ordered mine with a Lentil burger while he chose buffalo tempeh. It was absolutely amazing and rivaled the last \"actual\" garbage plate I had at Nick Tahou's years ago. The plate arrived completely filled with Mac salad, mashed sweet potatoes, and loads of thick, meat sauce on top of the giant lentil burger. There was a nice balsamic side salad as well. I was a little apprehensive since I hate sweet potatoes but they made a delightful, sweet addition to the plate. The macaroni salad was incredible, although I felt the pasta was a bit undercooked. The lentil burger and meat sauce both had phenomal flavor and texture, although I would have preferred the sauce to be spicier. I added some much needed Frank's to make it the perfect plate. My only real gripe was the temperature issue: the sweet potatoes and Mac salad were cold, while the burger and meat sauce were hot. When I mixed everything together, as one must do with any garbage plate, it rapidly became a luke-warm mess. It would have been a truly perfect mess if it was hotter or even just microwaved for a few minutes. Aside from this, my compost plate was absolutely delicious and made me feel stuffed like traditional, greasy garbage plate are known to do, but without all the intestinal pain and discomfort. I'll definitely be back and would recommend The Red Fern to anyone visiting the area and looking for an unforgettable bite!"}, {"review_id": "MB_-LTUz07JWe1Qux5ghOQ", "user_id": "MXYzMliu_OvKU-G8cSyCMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/3/2017", "text": "Goin all in on this 5 star rating.

This place embraces who they are and I'm here for it..at least for my 1st Rochester visit.Food was delicious. I had my first Vegan Quesadilla and I'm was more than impressed. Cheddar, Vegan sausage, kale, fermented garlic and pickled red pepper all worked so dam perfectly together. The cheddar was oozing with deliciousness and had me wondering, \"should I start eating Vegan More?\" The answer is yes. Yes you should J. And don't even get me started on the lemon aioli for the dip game!! My side salad was green and leafy and great with just the right amount of balsamic? dressing on it. My fiancee enjoyed a delicious cold zoodlei pesto salad (the PZL)..i know it was delicious cuz I ate some like a boss. Our friends enjoyed the steak bomb sandwich (didn't try but the bread looked out of this world and he said it was great) and the lentil burger (another fine report).I have entered the realm of Vegan and I ain't goin back! I'll be exploring my options when I go out to eat in NYC. Oh and the drinks were amazing,  light and refreshing.

Needless to say, I left thoroughly impressed... with the restaurant.  Just that. ***To start, it's all vegan here, so you won't have to worry about hunting around the menu asking for ingredients and whatnot.  They're very faithful and easygoing with their vegan-ness, however, and it can sometimes be misleading.  Make sure you know that anything listed will not contain any real meat.***I tried the buffalo bleu sandwich, which is available in a gluten-free option.  For an extra dollar, you can add avocado to just about any dish, which I would recommend doing for this sandwich. I enjoyed the food, though the buffalo flavor wasn't overpowering or even especially notable. There was a hint of bleu cheese as well, though again it didn't take over the medley of flavors. The greens the sandwich came with were nice, surely fresh and tossed in a nice dressing, but they didn't stand out and I didn't eat them all.***Portion size was impressive.  I'm a 6' man and I ate heartily.    **The interior is beautiful.  Wood carvings galore, tree stumps arranged in abstract patterns, even classic books of great literature (even Where the Red Fern Grows!!!) adorning the walls.  The bathroom is located completely across some apartment entrances, which is a bit odd at first, but is worth checking out- it's like leaving to another world, like stepping through a wardrobe into Narnia.  **Location: such a cool, interesting strip of Rochester.  Defnitely walkable from many popular/central areas- we were at the Rochester Museum and Science center, and this place is a five minute walk away. **Service: not superb.  Our waitress was friendly and gave us plenty of time for ordering when we requested it.  She reached across us, however, and spilled coffee onto my plate! She also coughed a lot, which I understand isn't really her fault, but it's not attractive from a customer's perspective.  **My date pressured me to give this place five stars, but I'm more inclined for four.  I'll be coming back here (alone, likely).  It's quiet, friendly, warm and welcoming. **4/5"}, {"review_id": "viVkDONXsf7cBUuD6Yo0Yw", "user_id": "gruKWCj9jEJ5klDGg0bUmw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/9/2017", "text": "I'm not vegan or vegetarian but every now and again I try to eat a bit healthier.
