No Frill had large sized portions and everything was amazing. I got the seafood trio with a crab cake, fish, and fried shrimp it was literally to die for. I could've eaten it again if there was any left! My boy got the bone in pork chop that looked really succulent. Everything was cooked extremely well.Service was cool and quick, we sat at the bar and had a round of beers and ate. Great aesthetics and better food! I'll be back."}, {"review_id": "8rtwWZd4L3Uy9m2J42UeSQ", "user_id": "M1Dwa2sg0LCkddUdEwTIcg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "It's been awhile since we have eaten here, our last experience wasn't that great I recall probably the reason we haven't been back. Any how not to start off on a negative note, but that's the reason for this rave review. My search for a delicious steak found its end tonight, and I know maybe no frill isn't known for its steaks. Mainly because they only have one on the menu, but this baby was cooked almost perfect and very tender. The presentation was excellent as well, serve with a huge amount of garlic butter, and lightly steamed green beans. My wife's smoked salmon was excellent as well, my old favorite menu item. And the chicken nachos were rediculously good, and huge. There beer selection wasn't that great, and the tuna sandwich well just avoid that baby because it was on salt over load. Overall service was good, the food was great. We will return."}, {"review_id": "H8JIh7qzmTUbvtlxJeSZWQ", "user_id": "BOXQsZOl00z7Xomou88rrw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "A frequent stop for work lunches, date night meals and dinners with my family of 6. There are lots of options for foodies and picky eaters alike, including sandwiches, burgers, steak, chicken, pasta, salads, gyros, shrimp, crab cakes, pierogies and more comfort food!  Portions are fairly big, giving you added value for the cost of your meal!  The blackened tuna pita has been my recent standby. Check out the daily specials board posted above their full service bar area; be on the lookout for the meatloaf, my co-worker's vice.The restaurant's decor features local artists' \"taste\"ful works (sorry). Waitstaff are always friendly and efficient; food wait times are fairly short! The owner has gone out of his way to accommodate our large group work functions, even on short notice; more impressive, he's SUPER community minded, recently donating to my childrens' school fundraiser after a quick face-to-face conversation.There may be a wait during peak lunch and dinner times but it's well worth it.  Besides, how can you not eat at a place that serves a chicken sandwich called \"the Funky Chick?\""}, {"review_id": "B7OS2GPIES_E6FhpX4BBDg", "user_id": "SJ_lwdn0spdtEa-C-1j_xg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Stopped in on s Saturday night with friends. Place was busy but we were seated immediately and served promptly. Started with the loaded pierogies which were good but nothing special. I got the Salmon Shrimp & Grits which was a great dish save for the excessive char on my shrimp and sausage that gave those bites an off flavor. Grits were creamy, sauce was excellent and the dish as a whole was good.  My wife got the Cali Club Wrap and loved it. All in all, decent value for money and a cool spot."}, {"review_id": "EWm37tmi1m7TsOvNYcDBrA", "user_id": "XA98jjDYs4LpjJKeeeGrSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Finally made it here to actually eat dinner. I normally stop in for the crème brûlée, but this time I wanted to have dinner here with family. There was no line no wait when we came in, so that was a bonus. I got the butterfly shrimp. My son got the crabcake sandwich My husband got shrimp and grits. Crème brûlée The portions at this restaurant is perfect. Don't second guess, if it's going to be enough food. Trust me it will be.  The butterfly shrimp were huge. But they probably could've used more seasoning in their batter. I was surprised by the crabcake, it was actually delicious. however the curb appeal was off putting. For some reason in Virginia, they seem to batter their crabcakes. This is the only way I can describe it, because every time I order it in a restaurant it looks the same way. I think if I ordered this again, I'll ask for broiled. The shrimp and grits was going to be shared by my husband and daughter. The server politely suggested that they split it in the kitchen.  That was the perfect suggestion, because the portions were perfect for two people. My only negative, was that we had to hunt down the server in order to get our check. The restaurant was filling up and it was hard to track him down."}, {"review_id": "fgvAjwB4znhBe3QviHmD7g", "user_id": "AwrHKbiKQSA7GWeXuhga8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "This place is so awesome for home made comfort food that is a reflection of Southern/American food. Make sure you arrive early or make a reservation because it can get crowded and parking is sparse in the neighborhood.The food is amazing! I take all my visitors here because they can have a taste of Southern comfort food. They have specials with prices so affordable for the quality and quantity. We came on a Tuesday and had the comfort food specials. The meatloaf was so divine and moist and tasty! The serving was so big that I had it for lunch! I also had the corned beef grilled cheese on black bean bread and Brunswick soup,  which took away the cold weather for a bit! My kids also enjoyed the grilled cheese sandwich on Texan toast! My husband had the tuna gyro, which he said was over cooked a bit but it was rich in flavor so it made up for it. You have to try this place and I can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "HCmLS1wLm006U0MwYZs5AA", "user_id": "UzORoQ_fU_IOneGWx_wpVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/31/2017", "text": "There is something about the No Frill Bar and Grill location in Norfolk that makes it stand out above the Virginia Beach location. It's cozy atmosphere makes this one of my favs in Norfolk. Oh, and can't forget to mention the amazing staff and service. Today i had the chicken biscuits and sausage gravy, a generous portion of 2 biscuits smothered with gravy and topped with fried chicken tenders perfectly cooked. The cheesy potatoes and scrambled eggs put me over the edge but it was worth every bite. So delicious!

I come in, start off with the bowl of Chili topped with shredded cheese and sour cream, and a side of cornbread. Gets my taste buds screaming for more every time. This is also one of few spots I make sure to try something new every time. Only because the menu items are nothing common. For example, calamari salad isn't something you can get anywhere, neither is their crazy drunken bread..... The Ghent location has \"porch seating\" and is a little smaller but has a bar. The Hilltop location is bigger and seems more family inviting with the longer tables for bigger parties."}, {"review_id": "yg8r6ADpBdvPjpU4kEF3aQ", "user_id": "6bDedJQTSEsmlWkFDk9kLg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "Amazing food here (as always)!!We started off with the pierogi appetizer. I've been craving pierogis and they aren't something you typically see on a menu. Perfect amount of cheese, spices and sour cream. My burger was SO big and delicious! Everything was so fresh...lettuce, tomato, red onion, & avocado!! It was cooked just right (medium rare) and I took home more than half of it. My bestie got the famous Funky Chicken Sandwich with Provolone cheese (versus the Swiss that comes with it). She loved it and also took home more than half. We both commented on how much we loved the French fries too. Everything was SO yummy!!I ordered a dirty martini, but literally had three sips because I like the taste, but just cannot drink that much. If you're in the area or nearby this place is worth the trip!! TIP: Get here early because it gets packed quickly!! Also, their salads are huge and again...great taste and high quality; try the grilled chicken or tuna as an add on!"}, {"review_id": "BtRcbm8VktI5E3NyFgeGIQ", "user_id": "80koGJqfR97WDnBgNxtyRQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "This place is something else.

Great flavors, amazing portions, and good prices. Come here if in the Ghent area!On my last visit, our group got nachos for an appetizer, and they were some of the best I've ever had, and also one of the biggest portion sizes I've seen before. Definitely recommend for a dinner group....or just a date if you're feeling super hungry and ambitious. For my entree, I ordered the London Broil salad on a whim (I typically never get salads) but I was blown away by how full I was and how great the steak was grilled.  It was easily the best salad I've had at a restaurant. Also, the dressing was incredible: parmesan pepper. All the dishes run $10-18, and are so worth all the food you get! Service is quick and accurate.  It can get a little loud in the restaurant as they seem constantly busy (rightfully so)."}, {"review_id": "NHWxnYfybl-ndYrSicXgNg", "user_id": "B0FedqtiYrxIhEh-zlB5kQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "To be fair, I can only write a little bit because I didn't get to experience any of the food or service here. Mainly wrote this for people who have to eat gluten free.Me and my sister came here for lunch. We were hoping to find a good gluten free menu since we were on Colley and a lot of the places here tend to cater to that. We walked in and the place is nice and clean, kind of dark. Looked like a lot of business types were there for lunch. It was today (Thursday) around 1pm. We asked for a gluten free menu and it was pretty much a let down. They had salads (as usual) and sandwiches without bread. Anyone who HAS to be gluten free like me (I have a wheat allergy) knows how much of a let down this is. I don't always want a salad and most places these days, and especially in this area, have gluten free bread for sandwiches. We decided to go to another place across the street.Overall, this seems like a great place. Seems like the food would be enjoyable, but I just felt like having a more expansive selection from which to choose today."}, {"review_id": "-xWGStiGT94rLj1KbD8rvQ", "user_id": "OrGj6hWhs0XYLmeS_JyebA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/27/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "One of Norfolk's best restaurants  I absolutely this place but I went last Sunday afternoon and the customer service horrible the worst I have ever had here, and I love this place ..it was not crowded so that made my visit more upsettingDecided to go back because I absolutely love this place... and all is right in the world...everything was perfect.. like it should be"}, {"review_id": "ce8HQTKbwyZ0ZJZaiXTBwg", "user_id": "bg1hU5UCefxAI5P8qYdvRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "Love, love, love.
