Kansas City has a number of great BBQ places. There are only a few CTQ (critical to quality) performance standards and flavor profiles that differentiate them from each other - and it really depends on what you feel like and your personal expectations. I know we have a lot of Joe's fans out there, so just to be clear before you yell boo, my rating isn't based on just the food alone.So, let's talk about Joe's in Leawood. From the outside it looks like a classy place ready to provide a great dining experience. This brings me to our first CTQ - Service/Experience. Do you want to be served or serve yourself? It's not a trick question, but you should know what you are in for.From the moment you walk in, you are herded like cattle through a maze inspired line that eventually leads to a cashier (who only takes your order). The kicker is the line can sometimes be out the door and take almost 30 minutes to get to the register. As if you haven't waited long enough already, you then wait to pay for your food at another register and wait again until it's ready, which is served on a plastic try with a plastic cup for you to select your drink from the self-serve station. Next, you have to stand and scan the restaurant for an empty seat, hoping that one becomes available before your food gets cold. This isn't a big deal if the place isn't busy, but it's ALWAYS busy. I don't mean to be overly critical, but it's a lot of work and wait to eat at Joe's. I'm well aware of the Joe's gas station location on 47th Street, and would expect the cattle call, cafeteria line vibe there - it's a gas station. It's because of this service model that I only eat at Joe's when I have plenty of time and patience on my hands.The 2nd CTQ - Price. I just told you about all the work you do yourself, but that doesn't mean it's going to be cheap. Joe's will cost you just as much as the other guys (maybe even more) and they'll still ask for a tip.The 3rd CTQ - Quality of Food. Joe's does indeed have great BBQ. The portions are generous and the flavors are everything you'd expect from a Kansas City BBQ legend. The burnt ends and Z-Man sandwich are popular favorites. I like their BBQ ham as well. If you need more flavor, the tables offer extra sauces to spice things up.Joe's scores well on the 4th CTQ as well - Cleanliness. The staff works hard to keep the place clean and bus tables quickly. If you want to know how much a place really cares about their establishment check out the restrooms. Joe's passes the test there too!Overall, I like Joe's BBQ and eat there often. It just feels more like a lunch place to me (only if you get an hour) and the experience can sometimes leave you frustrated. For my money, time, dining pleasure and BBQ taste, I feel Jack's Stack offers a better dining experience with BBQ that rivals, if not beats, Joe's.Ok, there, I said it."}, {"review_id": "9w9LhmW1NP3jYxSJqXfZGQ", "user_id": "Pp-K0ZLjVEDmVkf5CPuM-A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Joe's has a ton of reviews but I thought I should add another.

Joe's is probably the most talked about BBQ joint in Kansas city, so I needed to know what the hype was all about.There was quite a wait when I arrived at around 5:30pm. Take in mind this is not the original location, so I was expecting the wait to be minimal. I waited about 30-40 minutes until finally getting to the counter to order.I split the following with another person in the group.- 1 lb burnt ends- short ends (ribs)- 2 orders of onion ringsI'm a big fan of burnt ends, and I knew they were quite popular at Joe's. There is a little note next to burnt ends \"When available\", so I would make sure to come earlier to beat the dinner rush. The burnt ends were incredible. Some of the best burnt ends I've ever had. The ribs were great too, but not on the same level as the burnt ends. Onion rings were good, thick and crispy. I should've shared an order of onion rings. One order could easily feed two people.I had a great experience at Joe's and would definitely come back. I would aim for coming at an early time though, maybe 3pm instead of 5:30pm to avoid long lines."}, {"review_id": "cF8hzsqGibcGbzzmOAu4Vw", "user_id": "Hi10sGSZNxQH3NLyWSZ1oA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "If I was Madonna I'd strike a POSEIf I was Owen Wilson I'd have a big NOSEIf I'm Pinnochio, I lie and it GROWSBut if I want BBQ, I go to JOE'SI hooked up with your bf, now we're BRO'SI hooked up with your gf, and your Mama KNOWSShe walked in on us in the THROESShe joined in, then we went to JOE'SSo every girl you know is one of my HOESI even date your fave cashier at LOWE'SAnd the guy that buys your PantyHOSEAnd I take them out to eat at JOE'SYour Dad's at my door, trying to PROPOSEI'll let him down easy I SUPPOSEIt's so tough having all these BEAUSI'll have to take them to eat at JOE'SYou say no homo, I say yes HOMOSEven your grandpa gave me sex KUDOSLet's just say no members of your fam are VIRGO'SAnd I took them all to eat at JOE'SAs for your other sister, she likes LACTOSEShe's the only fam member that keeps my TEMPOSAnd when it's over we're covered in white VISCOSEWe get cleaned up (or not) and head to JOE'SSome people go slow, I BULLDOZEI devoured your cuz like the shark in SHALLOWSFlute in her thingy?

And if I cannot compete with you, and I'm begging you not to take my man, then it's Jolene's Kansas City BBQ.Speaking of Dolly, my Dolly would like this, but she's a vegan now, so not as much as in the old days.I was slightly disappointed to find out that my beloved Oklahoma Joe's had turned into Joe's KC BBQ, expanding to the rich southern suburbs of KC. Sure, everybody deserves to have access to this food, but I knew it wouldn't be quite as good after expansion, and it isn't.However, it's still very worth trying. But go to the original location if you can (if you have time to stand in line).As for this new, suburban spot? It's still 5 stars, especially considering their legendary, delicious Z-man sandwich is still affordable, and very tasty. The brisket on it is excellent, succulent, flavoured spectacularly, and it just seems like a great product.However, I do remember it being more sloppy, less generic, less corporate. Inflation and expansion hasn't raised prices much, but it has decreased the originality, homemade-ness, and perfection. My first Z-man at the gas station was somewhat sloppy, perhaps *the* most orgasmic BBQ sandwich I'd ever tasted. Now it's still up there, but is morphing into a fast-food item, and you can taste the difference. The famous sauce is a little bit mass-produced, generic and sugary now. I'll probably try it with different sauce next time.I feel like KC sauce should be more salty than sweet. Like my... but I can't argue with this wonderful, legendary spot, so popular, and they taste so good. They as in their foods. Not them, the owners or workers. Although I'm sure a few of them do taste good. Hiiiiii.KC has the best BBQ in the whole country, a few places in TX compare, and that's it. Certainly if you are in KC, you *must* try a Z-man.So: Burnt Ends, Pulled Pork, Brisket at Arthur Bryant's, any meats at Woodyard, and this Z-man. But not this location. Go to the original gas station location near town - better from the experience, to the unique originality, to the taste, even.So all my sisters and BROSNow that I kept you on your TOESYou'll be glad you CHOSEThe Z-man at JOE'SWHAT"}, {"review_id": "01pKbxVyFORsWhNFtaMHkg", "user_id": "KPwOsOSMoZtj-bQqsATeJw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "I came into Joe's KC on Friday night with some co workers.

Don't know exactly how long we were in line but I guess around 10-15 minutes. I had been here before a year prior and had burnt ends for the first time with a side of red beans and rice and loved it. This time I came in having been in St. Louis the last two days eating ribs, so I was BBQ ready.I got the Ribs dinner with 3 ribs and sausage, side of red beans and rice & a Z man sandwich. The ribs were good, but not as good as the ones we ate in St. Louis, if I'm being honest. It just didn't have the smoke the STL ribs had. That said, I have to say that they spicy sauce at Joe's is better than anything I tasted in St. Louis. The sausage was just ok, and the red beans and rice was pretty good like last time. The Z man sandwich is the star though. Brisket, cheese, onion rings, everything just comes together. If not for the Z man this would have been a 3 star review for sure.

Of The few places I've tried since I've been in Missouri , this has been my fave bbq place for many reasons...PARKING: good considering it's in a huge shopping center.CUSTOMER SERVICE: not bad.

I'm not quite sure since I didn't pay FOOD: delicious flavor but I'm not sure if it was my end of the ribs or what because my side was mostly fatty rib and my husband's side he said was beefy and juicy. But the little meat I did have fell right off the rib when I'd try to pick up the rib and eat it. Most people like that (I do too for the texture) but for food handling it is a lil annoying (first world problems). APPEARANCE: nothing fancy but perfectly what a bbq joint should be. Casual. Packed. Fast.OVERAL: this is what I imagine when I think of a bbq restaurant. When you come in you line up to order than you wait for your food than find your seat. There is lots of seating but it was busy (we went on a Friday night) so it got packed fast. We happened to arrive before the crowd came in.

But, I love the gumbo at Joe's which is on my way home.  Three weeks ago, I called in an order for a slab of ribs and a quart of gumbo.  I had a couple of people coming over for dinner and I knew they liked the gumbo too. I got to the take out counter and picked up my order. When I got home I found the slab  and a quart of beans. So bummed out! I live in Lee's Summit so there was no going back. I called the manager to let him know what happened. I explained I'd ordered a quart of gumbo but got baked beans instead. He started down the road of 'well, we really don't have BAKED beans, we do have BBQ'd beans...\" Really?? He wants to debate about if their beans are described as BBQ'd not baked when I didn't even order beans??? I curtly responded by pointing out that I ordered GUMBO but got BEANS. How clueless...  He offered to replace the beans with gumbo if I wanted to bring them back. I'd already told him I lived in Lee's Summit so I guess he knew it was a safe bet I wouldn't drive back in rush hour traffic and he was right.   He said he would take charge for the beans off my card. As I told him the time on my receipt and what I ordered, I trusted that he would. He didn't.  Really poor customer service!

The first bite told me it was the best decision I made that day. The ribs were juicy and the bbq sauce savory. I may have even added more sauce from the extra bottles on the table... but I won't tell. The texas toast was really tasty.
