They are fairly quick, even on the weekends. They are courteous, both on the phone and at the door. The food is fresh and hot always.The wife can't stop talking about the Wonton Soup. This happens every time she orders it and it's still like the first time. Every. Time. I personally really like their Hot & Spicy soup as well. You wouldn't think soup would be difficult, but these guys top the others in this category. Cashew Chicken and General Tso's are both good here too. A surprise to me: the wife actually likes the fried rice, which isn't normal for her. I prefer less peas (read: no peas), but yup; it's good rice.The egg rolls are pretty \"meh\" in our opinion. But when that's our only complaint, that doesn't really affect the star rating."}, {"review_id": "BFG3eF4LlI8gxDS8QeE8hw", "user_id": "wg7BIF9xfgiVNKpaX6QkHg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/17/2017", "text": "Great value Chinese food spot in Cedar Rapids. Lunch specials, on average are only $5.75 and include a crab ragoon or an egg roll. I would recommend ordering take out versus dine in as their dining room is very tiny and very simple. I ordered the lunch beef with broccoli, wonton soup and an order of steamed dumplings. The dumpling portion was huge: 8 dumplings for $5. They were decent. The wonton soup was a chicken broth base with homemade wontons and also decent, a little bland. The beef with broccoli was adequate - again, a little bland. The beef was tender and broccoli was cooked well. I would have liked everything on the menu to have more flavor: garlic or scallions. I saw on their website they deliver within a five mile radius of their location - which is a huge plus considering not many restaurants do. Overall, this is a great spot to grab your lunch to go and not spend more than $6! Give it a try if you are in the area."}, {"review_id": "7fy0rvpDQ2CaJzhDjmdzVw", "user_id": "ehBRk-wEAr4Z8dBFVRhksA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "Have not been disappointed yet, I lovelovelove the chicken sticks!   But I'm hungry so come in with it, man!"}, {"review_id": "8I2j6LAn27ACcC7ODKTfQg", "user_id": "w4P-gxcj7WlOjJsdcDPLGA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "Just average Chinese food.

For years my wife and I have been trying to hunt down a Chinese food place that wasn't pure trash. Reading the reviews I was excited but still cautious. Let's get into it:First off, you can't beat the price, especially with the portions they give you. We ordered Mongolian beef, orange peel chicken, chicken fried rice and some of their donuts for after. All of that and it was under 30 bucks. Secondly, the food taste really good. I was surprised by the spice and flavor that most other places lack. Lastly, the staff was friendly and the location isn't too far from our house. We will be back for sure."}, {"review_id": "okxxxHkOqaPJgwJLNVpv9A", "user_id": "mdj1FH1jeVguYgH2JTGi4w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "I should write reviews more often, especially as a fellow local restaurant owner, but this one made a big enough impression on us we had to take time to review!  First time ordering & we did takeout.  My husband picked up and said it felt very family owned which is something we love!  Then I opened up the order and first thing I saw was a box of donuts labeled \"free\" on the top.  Something we hadn't ordered but was put into our bag.  What a nice gesture!  Our twin 8 year olds were super excited to have them as dessert!  All the food (General tso's, sesame chicken, & chicken/rice soup, & shrimp fried rice) was delicious and very high quality!  We will be back!"}, {"review_id": "GiveACunLHZ3bzQ923Cktw", "user_id": "UOBlGoGyF2S7ZGJOO3GSBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Been looking for better Chinese delivery. OMG I have found it. Ordered steamed dumplings, chicken egg rolls, crab Rangoon  broccoli beef and sesame chicken and they were all top notch. Delivery was before the quoted time and everything was nice and hot. They even topped my order off with a box that said \"Free\".  And when we opened it we found Chinese donuts!! They were fantastic. It was all simply some of the best Chinese delivery we have had in a very long time. Congrats to Panda Lin. We will be regulars as long as you keep serving us food of this quality. Friggin love it. Even the online ordering was simple and not frustrating. Looking forward to more of the same. We have ordered several times now and I'm glad to say I still f-ing love it. This is the best Chinese takeout/delivery in town. No question.  Try the dumplings.Continue to order from here and have loved every experience.  This is exactly what Americans want when they order Chinese food.  Still love this place and will keep trying new items cause everyone we try is amazing."}, {"review_id": "dZUkKuHLYTSiMqnHi7AbLw", "user_id": "gsZlJJ9gOjGi0kDIxYlBag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/26/2017", "text": "I ate here twice on a recent trip to C.R. and definitely ranks as some very good Chinese Food! Fresh and tasty, and you can't beat the prices! I loved the general tsao chicken. We also had Mongolian beef, Kung pow chicken, pork fried rice, egrolls, egg drop soup, and their donuts! The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the Mongolian beef due to a bit low on the meat and the beef was kind of chewy. But for the price, convenience, and being open on Christmas, I'm not complaining at all."}, {"review_id": "AtLVmmkSQ4FnMKCdJnB47A", "user_id": "Y6MGVZqs9UqgM6KPFaysSA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2017", "text": "Very pleasantly surprised! I've settled for mediocre Chinese food in Cedar Rapids for too long. Tonight we decided to try Panda Lin to see what it was all about.My SO and I got beef & broccoli, pork lo mein, steamed dumplings, crab rangoon, and chicken fried rice. We ordered online for delivery (which is so convenient and awesome!) and it arrived in about 45 min. The food was really superb. Crab rangoon were crispy and flaky and flavorful. Lo Mein was oily in that delicious way. Dumplings were soft and savory. Beef and broccoli sauce was great and the broccoli was surprisingly fresh tasting! The rice is nothing to write home about, but not bad at all.Prices were fine. Entrees were about  $6 each, so we ended up paying over $30 for two people, but there are plenty of left overs.Highly recommended! We'll be repeat customers for sure!"}, {"review_id": "73b4rL0cme9_N7Vmfq1eGw", "user_id": "oGXvd1uqeBYFLCpmoTePCw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/30/2017", "text": "I went to Panda Lin on a Wednesday afternoon, having never been there before I didn't know what to expect. What I found was a tiny little building with almost no parking lot. I walked in to what I assume was the Lin family spread out across a few of the tables. It looked like one of them was doing homework, and another looked like she was taking a nap. I didn't have a problem with that at all, it just added to the family atmosphere of the place. The service was fast, immediately a very friendly woman got up and took our order. I ordered a large serving of General Tso's chicken with white rice. They cooked it in under 10 minutes, and it smelled delicious the whole time. When they say large they mean it, they gave me a gigantic serving. And it was pretty cheap, which is always nice. As my friend, and I were eating our food the Lin family started bringing out food for their own dinner. They ate at the table next to us, and were very polite. They periodically asked if everything was ok, and if we needed anything. I would highly recommend this place, I wouldn't go and eat at the restaurant if you are in a party of more then a few people though. I've heard the delivery is fast, but I can't speak on it myself. Over all Panda Lin serves great food for a good price, and has a friendly family run environment. I will get food from here again."}, {"review_id": "AhKxz94K5T4stScer_K5lg", "user_id": "T0AS6sxkcoTIyklvtmTLxQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2017", "text": "Rated on food and delivery-I ordered online at 7:16pm. Received my order at 7:34! Wow! This is extra impressive considering I almost didn't order because of the distance from my house. The delivery man was super nice.My food was super hot, fresh, and delicious! I will never, ever again eat Chinese food from anywhere else and enjoy it. I feel like the potential of Chinese food has been hidden from me all my life. I had crabmeat Rangoons. These are amazing. They actually put crab meat in there! You can see it, it's a nice amount.  Never have I seen this before anywhere. Chicken sticks=chicken skewers. It's actually chicken! NOT mystery meat. Chinese donuts! Soft and fresh, covered in sugar. NOT hard pucksBeef with Chinese mushrooms!!!!! What?!?! I've never seen Chinese mushrooms here in Cedar Rapids. Amazing, delicious, saucy, beefy meat and veggies!!!!White rice=this is what it should be everywhere.I would like to know why everywhere else sucks so much. I'm hooked.The prices are more than reasonable. I hope they don't but I think they could raise prices a bit. And just an extra little bonus=8 cookies stapled to my bag. And the usual of course-fortune cookies. This is my first time ordering and I hope my first impression is a lasting one. Such great service, food, and prices!

My meal was delicious as well, although the red pepper flakes really snuck up on me! My mom got steamed dumplings and an order of the wonton soup, she had a cold, and she said she immediately felt better! She loved them both. \"Imagine how good it'll taste to me when I'm not sick!\" she said to me. My daughter loved it too. It was all so so fresh and delicious. It was the first time we'd tried panda lin, but definitely not the last! So so good!!
