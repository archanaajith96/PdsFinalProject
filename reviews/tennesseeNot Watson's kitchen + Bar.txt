Went with my sister and nice and thought I'd sneak in an out of town review ;) 3pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was fairly busy. We were sat right away and greeted within 2 minutes. We decided to share a couple of appetizers and settled on fried green tomatoes, burger sliders, and a side of their onion rings. (The onion rings are not listed as a side), but I saw them pictured via Yelp and asked.....Okay.... the onion rings! I love beer battered onion rings and these did NOT disappoint! Our server was awesome and brought out their \"house sauce\" (spicy mustard/mayo) to dip them it. Such a great choice. The sliders were also delicious with carmelized onions, bacon, and  blue cheese crumbles (all amazing toppings)...and the fried green tomatoes were also, well....awesome! They were spicy and we couldn't tell if it was the pimento cheese, tomato jam, or their light batter...but either way they was great. All items were out in less than 15 minutes. We left feeling full and the service was pretty...well....yes... awesome! I recommended that my sister bring all of her out if town guest to this restaurant in  Market Square."}, {"review_id": "Th-r717Cf3iTzqr6U2jecw", "user_id": "6JehEvdoCvZPJ_XIxnzIIw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Located in the heart of Market Square, I've had better here. Why? The service was horrible. Jumping ahead, when I went inside to the bar and asked to cash out, I mentioned that my servicer forgot about me and the bar tender apologized profusely, so it was all good.It was a gorgeous day, so after I checked in with the hostess inside, I requested outside seating... it overlooked Market Square. I was dining alone, so this made a perfect people watching experience for me. Luckily, I was pretty content in my people watching ways because it was quite awhile before the waiter finally came out and took my order.I ordered The Not Classic Cobb Salad. The menu described it with crispy fried chicken, but I requested grilled chicken instead of fried chicken. The best grilled chicken ever! The entire salad was fantastic, with the exception of the avocado dressing... it was thick and more like a mayo spread than a dressing. I was going to request ranch as a replacement, so I waited for a bit for the waiter to come back out to check on me. You guessed it, he never came back. Hopefully he won't be there long because it seems like the food is a hit, but the service blew it for me... too many options in the area for one to settle on service at this level."}, {"review_id": "v887h0Gu54lLz69iakUCNA", "user_id": "vP5-VYuQoQhBFbu8IRDp0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "Delightful lunch spot.  We arrived at the end if lunch rush, during an Arts Festival do downtown.  We were quite a 45 minutes wait, but it was actually 25 minutes.  We sat outside and soaked up the ambiance.  I had the wings and a wedge salad; my wife had the Strawberry salad.  The salalds - both - were very well-executed.  They did not just throw some vegetables together with a dressing; both were a well-thought out and executed dish.  The wings were meaty, tasty and presented well, with a decently hot chipotle sauce and a sprinkling of Bleu cheese on top.The wine and beers on tap scored as well.  Great service too.  We would definitely come back here!"}, {"review_id": "T8QRscPoFHLDFVcZh24gYw", "user_id": "GW_Zgwva1wuVfnOaBH73HQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "A rainy day in Market Square yields long wait times at restaurants. We first went into Honey Tupelo, the wait there was one hour and we put our names down and sat down. Every two to five minutes the door opened and we shivered with the cold air, but party after party we watched ppl being told 45 minutes to an hour wait. While we were sitting I went on my beloved and oh so trusted Yelp. Not Watson's came up and THE OPTION TO GET ON THE WAITLIST WAS AVAILABLE! what a CONVENIENT feature!!!!!! Bam, did that. Told me to check in within fifteen minutes. It was decision time. Looked at Honey Tupelo's menu, then at Not Watson's menu on my phone and it was a no brainer. We were outta Honey Tupelo and happily strolled the few few fee to Not Watsons. Reported for our check in and were seated at a table in a couple minutes!SCORE!!!My husband said this restaurant was WAY better interior wise than Honey Tupelo. He said the tables at HT are all crammed together and Not Watson's is more restaurant like. I was glad to hear this. It was our first day in Knoxville. I'm also glad we didn't stay at HT because I found out they have them in Georgia meaning it is not a restaurant unique to Knoxville. Anyhow, onto Watson's.Appetizer: Fried Green Tomatoes We were starving, so as soon as we sat down, I just told the waiter the first thing I saw on the menu which was fried green tomatoes. When the dish arrived I saw it had pimento cheese and ham on top. I personally do not like pimento cheese. However, that didn't stop us. I scooped it off and still enjoyed the fried green tomatoes. The batter was crisp and tasty, the tomatoes were a lil thin, but still overall a good appetizer. We packed the pimento cheese and my husband had it on a bagel the next morning. Hi5!Entrees: Not Yo Mama's chicken and waffles - The chicken was delicious. My children had this dish and when they don't have a problem eating it, I know we have a winner. You also get cubes of watermelon. It is sprinkled with chilli powder. That threw my kids off, but my husband and I love spice, so we enjoyed it. Plus, since my kids love watermelon, the mentally told their mouths to eat it, lol. The waffle and syrup were nice and hot, so we enjoyed the food temperature coming in from the rainy weather. Blackened Mahi Mahi- Very heavy and filling. Again, I ordered dishes but didn't really read the descriptions, so was discovering the dish while eating. A unique tomato blanc sauce surrounds the mahi which is on top of a bed of slaw salad like veggies and mashed potatoes. Not a flavor I've had often and it worked. Felt very food network like. I would just cook the mahi a lil less time so it falls into layers at the touch of my fork, but a great dish!Creole Pasta- Shrimp, alligator, and chicken in a delicious cajun cream sauce with linguine. All the flavors dance in your mouth and you're eager to take your next bite! Yum! However, the alligator was very tough. Next time, I'd just skip it all together and just have the shrimp and chicken.Our server was so friendly and pleasant. Checked on us throughout the meal, chatted, the whole 9. Therefore, I've given the restaurant five stars. Service from our waiter and the food was great!"}, {"review_id": "_6zzYB4lkiHNbH_6eIKZDg", "user_id": "fdedcSM9cfJsMt9IjXgWkw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "I had the fish and chips. The fish was crispy as was the fries. When my plate arrived, I was disappointed and thought the fries were burnt, but they weren't. They had an excellent flavor. I added a bit of malt vinegar over them and devoured them. The cole slaw had the best flavor. It had a unique flavor that reminded me of possibly lime. It was creamy, but light. I loved it. Service was a bit slow, but the whole restaurant was pretty steady with customers in and out."}, {"review_id": "5PpvJqw3ExsmS74e4aBI7g", "user_id": "FsK3KfL1rajT_33IDWZlfw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/18/2017", "text": "My mom and I navigated our way through rainstorm Irma to grab a dinner here while I was in town for work. The place was mostly empty as it was Monday (and obviously pouring outside). We ordered drinks only to discover that it was half priced wine night (YES!) and knew we made the right choice.I ordered the Cajun pasta with just chicken (had to lie about a seafood allergy to avoid eating alligator, but you do what you gotta do), while my mom ordered the chimichurri flank steak and subbed out the mashes for fried red potatoes. We ate so much food it was against our better judgement. My moms steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned and my pasta was creamy with just the right amount of heat.All of this with a bottle of wine came to only $25 each after splitting the check. Seriously recommend this place - fantastic quality and excellent prices."}, {"review_id": "00R3-688KZ43aoSLGorDvg", "user_id": "47DqummIWTx6s0atjiISeQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/9/2017", "text": "Creekstone beef! The best Burger I've ever had! The \"Pretty Hot Burger\" was super spicy and it can be challenging to eat if you're not use to spicy food. The calamari is delicious! Can also say that was the best I've ever had. I don't know what sauce they give the calamari with, but it's pretty darn good and I always ask for extra on the side so I can put on my burger. FYI: you can sub-in your fries for tater tots. They have outdoor seating and a ton of space inside. Even then, you may have to wait on weekends. Every time I'm in the knoxville area, will def try to stop here. Just a tip: parking in the garage is free after 6pm on week days and all day on weekends."}, {"review_id": "kYETFangnwg4QsowYRnbVw", "user_id": "bAmK1OzZpDkKeN_az63sMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Not Watson's Kitchen & Bar is probably one of my favorite spots in all of Market Square and one of my go to spots when in need of a solid brunch or lunch spot.This place offers a seriously updated and unique twist on traditional southern cuisine. Their starters, salads, burgers and entrees are solid. They keep their menu updated and seasonal which is a huge perk so there is always something new to try or you can usually stick to your \"usual\" order if you're like me and a creature of habit.I've never had a poor experience here. The price, customer service, quality of food and overall atmosphere is memorable.

This was one of those places. We felt well taken care of and had a wonderful brunch. The Bloody Mary was wonderful and a steal at only $4. I had the veggie Bennie and my partner had the market Bennie, with a side of tater tots - we both practically licked the plate afterwards. Delicious!

I ordered a pretty simplistic burger. The Parisian. The GF got the short rib sliders. So what was wrong with it? I don't think there was anything wrong, but there just wasn't a really big thing that was amazing about it that would want me to come here for a burger. I mean come on, considering the best burger in town is right next door, it's sort of hard to compete.  The Parisian burger came with some mushrooms and melted Brie cheese.Also, during our visit it came with a chlorine type smell around the whole restaurant that sort of made it feel unclean. I don't know if they just had literally wiped the tables down or something, but it just didn't smell right. I think that goes a long way when you're eating there as well and it could possibly sour your appetite. Overall, Not Watson's is just okay. I like their brunch and would probably come back for just that, otherwise I'll probably pass."}, {"review_id": "Ujup3zA9gJ4jTDft8lbSTw", "user_id": "CEQUhB-P-muWVFiB_lpMMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "Be prepared for multiple napkins and the use of both hands to eat their Chili Macaroni n Cheese burger.
