The food is fresh, delicious, and even healthy. The kids enjoyed seeing the chefs prepare the food. We could not believe the amount of fresh vegetables intermingled with tender and moist chicken or steak.

Best of all is their chips. The chips are the thinner ones and just a tad bit greasy. Burritos are quite large.Rice is a different flavor- kind of a buttery flavor- really plump tooNachos were kind of meh. The chicken tasted like it had a strange Chipotle flavor on them, but they weren't terrible.

In my frantic search for \"best burrito near me\" (on national burrito day, my new favorite holiday), Tavial was in the top few results and had been in my bookmarks for a while so away we went. And I'm so glad we did! We went around 6, and it wasn't very busy, so we had some time to take in their rather large menu. Legally, on that day we had to order burritos, so we did. I opted for the al pastor - $6.99 for what might be the biggest burrito I've held in my hands/arms. Extremely filling! The al pastor had a very good, slightly sweet flavor and was super tender. We tried the tiger cake as well - delicious! This is a great place for cheap, authentic Mexican in St. Paul! - They have a parking lot and a drive thru, are on bitesquad, they do takeout and the service is super quick!"}, {"review_id": "zb-I0pGPjKze7E6PGuaTLg", "user_id": "qgi0hBGm6VrDtTA_ElOFHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/11/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I'm here more than I should be but the food is just soo good.

It's places like this that make me think West 7th is the BEST neighborhood in St Paul. If I ever become a city kid again, this is where I'm headed.I had chicken tacos and a chicken tamale. I eat a lot of tacos and i've had some so-so corn tortillas and masa. At Tavial, these items were excellent. Yes. I also had some of their amazing chips and salsa. Yes. I'm not a big steak or pork fan when it comes to Mexican, but my husband craves those items here. I rarely eat both rices and beans...bc I'd rather have a second taco.It's just nice enough inside to stay and eat, but I would get to go here constantly if I lived closer."}, {"review_id": "rr4IArlC6U8M2_BJ8NU0bA", "user_id": "Kl7uOQWLBCmQN3phUx9tWA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/18/2017", "text": "Finally made it here recently for dinner after finding our first choice with a long line of people waiting to get in. No wait at this place.There were a few diners already seated at tables eating their dinner selections and the place seemed oddly quiet of any human sounds except for a little talking in kitchen area.Being my first time here, I ordered their chicken enchiladas plate that included rice and refried beans. I asked the woman behind the counter taking our order whether they made their horchata from scratch. She said they did, and offered that they also make their own jamaica, too. Based on what she told me about their horchata, I ordered a serving of it. After placing our order, we were told our order # so that we could retrieve our food once it was prepared.The first sip of the horchata was one of heavy sweetness and little else, which made me think they might not actually make their own from scratch. It tasted like it may have been pre-mix stuff. From my experience, made from scratch horchata is lighter in body, less sweet, and with a pronounced cinnamon flavor. My chicken enchilada plate was served on a porcelain plate and with a plastic fork. And no knife. I had an awkward time cutting bites of enchilada with the side of an unstable plastic fork. Strange that they served food on a porcelain plate but with no metal flatware.The enchilada sauce was a tangy green tomatillo and the chicken inside seemed moist and tasty. The rice and beans were really good. Getting to the end of my enchilada trio, I found the last one simply folded over like a taco, instead of rolled up.Part way through our meal, the silence inside the place was broken by someone turning on some Mexican music. Ahhh! That's just what was needed for some ambiance!"}, {"review_id": "xbugpxyXouioY9abAnGp8A", "user_id": "xo_czY-S4r7OPR0U5n1JYQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "Awesome menu. Lots to choose from and very affordable. Friendly staff and very fast and good service. Food tasted great and certainly had an authentic Mexican taste and feel to it. The inside had a bit of a hole in the wall feel but it did not feel dirty. Just felt like a fast food restaurant from the 90's kind of. The staff was cool and clearly seemed to care about making you a good meal.

I take that back. I don't like Tex-Mex food. My husband does though, but I rarely eat out at Mexican restaurants in the Twin Cities. We decided to stop here for a quick lunch and I have to admit, it was really delicious. While the ambience is lacking, the food tasted authentic, fresh and very flavorful. I ordered the carnitas and Pastor pork tacos. For $2.75/taco, you can't go wrong! The green hot sauce was delicious also. The customer service was great/friendly, and the place was very clean.

Great selection, even though I pretty much only get the carnitas tacos when I go there. This is a casual, hole-in-the-wall neighborhood restaurant.

Definitely a hole in the wall hidden gem!- the pastor taco - the best flavor and only $2.5- the fish tacos - a close second- the chicken Tinga - I was debating between this and the chorizo and the lady at the counter said the chicken was better. Good flavor but not my favorite.Also ordered the chicken tamale but took it to go as I was stuffed.
