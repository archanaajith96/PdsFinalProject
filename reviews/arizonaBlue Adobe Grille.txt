We obviously got chips and salsa, this salsa was excellent! It is very smokey and if you park in the back you can see where they have the pecan wood stored for their smoked shrimps and chicken and anything else I guess. We got the Hatch Catch sampler that had corn cakes, shrimps, and lobster dip. The crab/corn cakes were more corn, sort of reminded me of a hush puppy more than a crab cake, underwhelmed but the description on the menu is exact, just still not what we expected. The lobster dip was great, super full of langoustines and very flavorful. The show stopper was the shrimps that were pecan smoked, soooo good, fresh and cooked to perfection, wish we had like fifteen of them!The house marg was avail as a carafe fdor two, not too strong but decent for ten bucks for a half carafe.Definitely will be back, the food and quality and service was great, cannot wait to explore more of the menu options as all sound exciting :)BTW, our bartender /server was Andy, he was very nice."}, {"review_id": "_UNnZeD0ydwR9LQHzUINCg", "user_id": "dmjRgQo8FQ794ZA_PjTI5Q", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/13/2018", "text": "I have been coming to Blue Adobe Grille for years. Recenlty, the service and food quality received there leves a lot to be desired.The last time in, I was there with my GF and excited to share Blue Adobe with her. Unfortunately, the dining experience was bad for several reasons.Our order took more than one hour to reach the table, which made for an uncomfortable situation. As other patrons were being seated, receiving their food, and leaving, before ours arrived around us.  It was embarrassing when the table next to us had a second couple come in and actually receive their food before ours arrived.  It was clear that one of a few things may have happened, possibly. These include that our order was not fired in the kitchen, that the food was perhaps messed up and had to be remade, or that our server simply forgot to ring it in.  But it was disappointing that there was no explanation as per the wait. It was not so busy that night that it was simply the result of the kitchen being backed up.  And worse yet, it took our server more than a half hour to replenish the tortilla chips. And even then, she did not refill the salsa or come back to the table to refill our drinks or even offer. When the food arrived, my girlfriend's meal lacked the correct proportions and almost resembled that of an appetizer. Embarrassing.When we communicated our disappointment with the evening, there was no apology or reasonable explanation offered. The server simply suggested that we pick a dessert in a somewhat rushed tone. Almost curt. To our dismay, the quality of the desert served was not very good. For what it's worth, I had ordered and enjoyed my usual meal in the Carne Adovada that night. I do wish to return to Blue Adobe Grille but have hesitated the last few times the craving set in. Here's hoping the best for this place; love the location, history and menu."}, {"review_id": "MhXa3XcFj9boXyJJG13myw", "user_id": "UVbk3lyok3-iHx6gSQ-rlA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "I loved Blue Adobe Grille. For over 13 years Ive been going there. Today I thought I would stop in as I was in the area. I was greeted nicely and since there was one of me  they seated me in a quiet area.My server was prompt and friendly. The moscow mule was spot on.I ordered the same thing Ive been ordering for over 13 years. The Cruz Kitchen - Tamale and Pork Chile Relleno. The tamale I didn't recognize. The masa was dark and little of it. Inside the meat was salty and overcooked and crunchy. Disappointment set in quickly. The rice was so-so and the beans were nondescript; however my chili Relleno was still very tasty, cooked to perfection and meaty.The salsa was good but not as good as in the past. It was a bit on the dark side and could use a bit of lemon to brighten it.Ill try them again but I can no longer recommend what I used to think was the best tamale in town."}, {"review_id": "ZVYxBYQ0MfT6ACRXSQAiTw", "user_id": "d7s2Kf-MmvTbNLG1w-8hIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I can't say enough good about this place. No surprise, you'll need reservations at dinner time. Not at lunchtime, but still crowded - - because the food and service is so good.  I must confess that I have only had the same dish the three times I have been there:\"Carne Adovada    $12Pork Roast simmered in house seasonings and immersed in our Red Chile Adobo Sauce. Cilantro Garnish & Flour Tortilla.\"It is just so good that I dream of going back for the same meal.  My wife and two of my buddies came with me on different occasions and all liked their entries very much, so I am writing a \"group review.\"They have a homemade salsa that is outstanding, and you can purchase a pint of it in a jar.BTW, it is not typical Mexican food they serve, but a Southwestern, New-Mexican cuisine.  There is overlap, but a difference in entrees and spices.  Can't wait to go back."}, {"review_id": "rrE2mOi89dGTZK99Mj9dDQ", "user_id": "MVyxYSpOP5RI6DnsJQox9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "I had a late lunch (early dinner?) here today and was blown away by the great service! The food came out quickly.The chile rellenos ARE FANFUCKINGTASTIC. The enchiladas were ok - they're really meaty, so my boyfriend enjoyed it, but I usually love dishes that have lots of veggies. Just personal preference. The complimentary nachos and salsa are high quality too. But the real winner was the pumpkin brulee, which was likely to be seasonal because it was on the chalkboard specials and not the menu. It's $8, which seems steep but the pumpkin brulee is QUITE big so it's definitely big enough to share between 2-3 people.(Unless you are a sugar fiend like me - I ate the whole thing by myself!)Happy hour is a good deal - you can get house margaritas for $4!The service was what convinced me to give the last star..

Our server Keefe was polite and provided good service but was spread too thin on this busy Saturday lunch crowd. They didn't seem to have enough staff to fill waters, offer more chips and salsa. We waited so long for everything especially our meals.Two orders for cheese crisps were ordered and one was so incredible greasy that it needed to be taken away as it made my daughter sick.  She also ordered kids chicken strips and the had an unusual breading and a terrible taste.We informed our server and he was very apologetic and offered to remove both items from our bill. Just disappointed this time around. The food seemed to be just tossed on plates and the presentabilty was lacking. May give another try as their reviews are very good and maybe were having an off day. However I appreciate consistency and expect the same meal to always be the same."}, {"review_id": "jBrapQvq6dM5xF52_03xhA", "user_id": "5tA6XMewAx5PWZHGSgwWbA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "11/13/2017Gained a star, now four.

I was less than impressed, though all was not bad. There were 5 of us and nobody had ever been. The cheese crisp and lobster green chili cheese dip were VERY good.

My wife have the garden enchilada and was very disappointed in the texture of the dish. Some vegetables were over cooked and some almost raw.

Second time we were smart and made a reservation just to go and it be pretty empty. Based on all the reviews we expected this place to knock our socks off. Unfortunately I left disappointed. Service was great. Our server was a really nice guy, can't recall his name but he knew the menu very well. It always impresses me when a server doesn't have to write down everyone's orders and just remembers them. I ordered the Land of Enchantment. It was the best of all worlds. Filet. Shrimp. Enchilada. Husband ordered the Carne Adovada Christmas style  and we started with guac. You get chips and salsa to munch on. I don't know if we had a bland batch but the salsa has no flavor what so ever. It looked like it was full of chilis and spice but nothing. The guac was delicious. It was chunky with chunks of avocado and jalapeños and onions. So good. Then food came out. Husbands carne adovada Christmas style was very good. My meal however was a fail. I ordered my steak medium rare. But it came back well done. Again. No flavor on the shrimp or the beef. Potatoes were orange. No flavor. Vegetables were carrots and zucchini and they tasted like alcohol. Not sure if they cook them in a wine or what but they didn't cook the alcohol of them. My husband just sniffed a carrot and was shocked of the smell. Server was kind to apologize for the steak. Then whom I believe was the MOD came by and said \"you're steak is well done?\" I agreed and she just took the plate. 10-15 mins later I got a new plate. Steak again was well done. Server again apologized. I said it was fine and I will just eat it. About halfway through the MOD made her rounds again and asked how it was. Told her it was edible. She asked if it was too rare. I said no. Well done again. She then argued with me. Saying that's how they do medium well there. Ok great. But I ordered it medium rare. She continued to argue that's not how I told her to cook it. But reality is she never asked how I wanted it when she took it away. Then proceeded to argue about it more. Finally I was just like it's fine. I'm going to eat it. Don't worry about it. She then said she will take it off my bill. It wasn't necessary because I told her I still was going to eat it. But she still took it off. Ugh. I was perfectly content with the server acknowledging and apologizing for the overcooked steak. But the MOD just made the situation worse. So in the end. Food was bland. Service was decent. But overall just disappointing."}, {"review_id": "EUbMfTCutwisFhnAphaFUw", "user_id": "3pLiCNrpNXtjOImodPNeFQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Excellent food!  The sauces are spicy so make sure to ask for none if you don't like spicy food."}, {"review_id": "q5C_Clef23bQchqzDsrtoQ", "user_id": "0T_xOB-Rl5679tf1K4PLow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "The service was superb!
