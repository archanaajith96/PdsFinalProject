I wish they have a joint open in California.Because of the price and the good reviews. I ordered a ribeye sammich and a single patty burger with jalapeños for myself. And you bet, I finished both of them. The burger was huge even for a single patty, and the sammich was packed with meat. The bread wasn't soggy so it held up well. My stomach was satisfied. Only thing was that the jalapeño wasn't spicy at all...Next time I want to try a triple patties burger. Look forward."}, {"review_id": "EKJ1oWrP91V4tVJ6REv7EA", "user_id": "VywibnKmxvsRrZ_7qY0w_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Ok I just want to say before anything the restroom is clean so many places have nasty filthy stinky restrooms and there is clean so applause to that!Now on to the food I couldn't decide on what I wanted to eat it was narrow down to the chicken and the turkey and I got the turkey sandwich and it was truly delicious I enjoyed every single bite!Now I did get fries instead of chips because the cashier said the fries were good but I didn't eat there I took the food home instead so they weren't as fries and a little soggy not there fault purely mine but the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the ranch that came with the fries it was lumpy....and that didn't sit well with me.Other than that I will definitely be back. People nice food good just know your in deep elum so your paying $5 to park!

So we decided to grab a bite to eat before the event. Walked around the corner and we thought this place had a unique name. That's what attracted us to it. It appeared from the outside as a typical hole in the wall restaurant. The menu had a variety of options to choose from. Mostly were items of various meat. For myself, I wasn't thrilled about trying beef that night especially from a whole in the wall. So I randomly decided to order the blackened fish sandwich and fries. That piece of fish on that bun was amazing. I personally think the bun lessened the taste of the blackened fish. But Ive never had a fish sandwich so I wanted to keep it as is. My group of 4 guys actually thought I was weird for ordering a blackened fish at a place like this. But after we all finished our food, they all stated they wish they had gotten the blackened fish sandwich as I did and that there food choice was OK. I actually enjoyed the blackened so much, I went up to the cooks and recommended them to ADD the option (to the menu) to serve the fish along with the broccoli or green vegetable that they offer. That would be a perfect meal for lunch goers in the area. They said thank you to my recommendation but Im not sold that they will actually ADD it to the menu. If you are near this place for lunch, PLEASE try that blackened fish. I'm sure most customers skip over that option as this place appears more like a bar than a restaurant."}, {"review_id": "sMT5DfDHTUOtcOwxmd9Lgw", "user_id": "SgGsI-JQQ56CAtwCbdMt1Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Not bad, just okay. We came in really late, and perhaps another visit during prime time is in order, but I really wasn't terribly impressed.Got the shaved ribeye with provolone instead of blue cheese and a double burger, both with fries, plus secret sauce and habanero ranch. Secret sauce was okay, a bit sweet for our liking. Looooooved the habanero ranch. Loved the fries - well done, as requested, and totally delicious. I would actually bump this to 3.5 stars for the fries and ranch alone.As for the mains. This is what brought my rating to what it is. If I go to a place for a good burger and good ribeye sandwich, of all things, they both better impress. I better be thinking about them for a few days after. But no. The burger was fine, but somehow no really distinct flavor profile - meaty or otherwise. The shaved ribeye was about the same. There wasn't enough meat, it had no distinct taste to it, and both the cheese and garlic mayo felt nonexistent. It was satisfying enough but that was about all.Service was super friendly, which went a long way, and the prices were extremely reasonable for the amount of food we had. I might stop here again if I was in Deep Ellum late, but it's not something I would necessarily crave."}, {"review_id": "wh0JpbcUXXKvY-57E3Yqdw", "user_id": "zhw2SUXamHSEVkeZ24_Tkg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Good sandwich place that we got to try out this past weekend.  I ordered the roast beef and the hubs ordered the cuben, both came with Fry's and we added a drink.We both enjoyed the sandwich but the Fry's we're almost soggy, they we're crazy over seasoned on some and the others had very little, it seemed that a seasoning shaker was used but they never flipped the Fry's to help make it more even.

The shaved ribeye steak sandwich was scrumptious. Thin slices of black Angus beef topped with grilled red onions, blue cheese crumbles, romaine lettuce, tomato and garlic mayo on a perfectly toasted, warm baguette. Needless to say, every bite was mouth watering.  The fries were so so. The secret sauce made them more enjoyable.  The ambiance was hip and the service was fast and friendly.

I didn't go for anything crazy... just a simple single patty burger with cheese. For being a no-frills burger, it was fantastic! I prefer a slightly thinner patty than most people and that's exactly what Uncle Uber's serves up. The fries that came with the burger were also equally as delicious. I also found the prices to be extremely fair and was surprised to see their fairly extensive beer list.... which was something I really wasn't expecting from such an establishment. The only issue I had with Uncle Uber's was the cashier. The gentlemen wasn't rude at all... but he didn't really seem all that interested in what he was doing.

I'm always up for trying a new burger place.

I got a double burger with everything on it and they were tasty. Mine was cooked well done, all the ingredients tasted fresh, the meat was good and the best thing to me I think was the bread. It was very fresh tasting.We got an order of cheese fries and shared it. My daughter is all up on snuffers cheese fries and she said these were comparable to snuffers. They want bad.I like their choice of local flavors of soda.The place was fairly busy but I believe we got our order in less than six minutes or so.For the two of us to grab a burger, fries and a couple drinks, the total cost was about $23.

Again I am super surprised at the ratings of this place. We asked what the most popular thing on the menu was so we ordered it - the shaved ribeye sandwich and their \"famous fries\". 0/5 food - I couldn't find a single thing that was good about anything in front of me except my glass of ice water. The bread, soggy. The sauce, way too bitter, odd cuts of lettuce, and the worst part - the ribeye meat tasted like it had been cooked way too long and sat under a heat lamp all day. Super dry, rubbery, underseasoned. The French fries were soggy and still somehow over cooked. I'm not sure why on earth this place was ever featured anywhere. Their fry sauce was a good attempt but also way too acidic.2/5 ambiance - it feels like a nice little dive bar, but the tables around us never were bussed and we were here for about an hour. They need a professional cleaning crew to come through h re and give it a good scrub. If the dining area was filthy I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like."}, {"review_id": "vNEslRgGK-T8glgbfCSBSQ", "user_id": "ngm01XWpYD_v4SLUVnMq6g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "- The Wait: I ended up coming here both for lunch and for dinner. Both times, the line was very short and we had a quick and efficient ordering process. The wait for the food was around 5-7 minutes. (5 Stars)- The Decor: The place was a very casual, industrial, bar-like restaurant. When you walk in, you have a line to the register where you would order, then you sit down somewhere before they call you up. The place looks a bit beat up, but has a good mishmash of decorations on the walls. (3.5 Stars)- The Service: The person who took our order was nice and patient. This place is more of a self serve place where they will cook the food and call you to pick it up. (5 stars)- The Food: I went to the restaurant twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times our friend recommended something. *The Burger (4.5 Stars) A little disclaimer on this, I did get this burger to go on a very cold day in Dallas. I didn't get to eat it for roughly 10-15 minutes while going back to my friends place. The best part about this burger definitely has to be the bun. It was lightly toasted, crisp, and had a solid feel to it. The patties were on the thinner side, so I would definitely recommend the double for a hearty portion. The lettuce was nice and crisp. I also liked the fact that the lettuce was below the patty. This allowed the bottom bun to stay dry and not get wet from the juices of the patty. It was a delicious, classic burger. Cost was reasonable at $8, but if you end up going for a burger, I heard they have $6 burgers on Tuesday with fries. *The Shaved Ribeye Sandwich (5 Stars)I thoroughly enjoyed this delicious meal. The balance of everything in this sandwich was great. The meat was tender, the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh, the onions were grilled perfectly, and the bleu cheese helped create and extra layer of pungent flavor which definitely enhanced the overall sandwich. The meal came with fries which were great. I definitely recommend this sandwich like everyone else has. $10.95 for a filling and delicious sandwich.- Overall thoughts: This is a great place to have a quick, and filling lunch. If you want a delicious, classic burger that has no frills to it, this is the place to go. I would definitely recommend the shaved ribeye sandwich, even if you do not like bleu cheese too much."}, {"review_id": "jhGDoJttMANS8q0naJ32ew", "user_id": "pII1_yXhZf3bOteJs6g1tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "I liked it. It has a very Twisted Root feel to it. It was a cool place with a fun relaxed atmosphere. The people working there the day I visited were very friendly and engaging. I was nearby for work and definitely enjoyed my meal. It seems like this place has an interesting story behind it. I'll probably ask the people there next time I visit about the history of the restaurant. I got their signature sandwich, the ribeye steak sandwich. It was pretty good. The fries were great. The sandwich, although delicious, was a little salty for me. Might've just been me tho. Restaurant itself was clean and well taken care of. Bathroom was clean. Fountain drink station had a good amount of variety. No reason not to eat here regularly :)Overall, it's a really good place for a quick bite. Definitely coming back to eat there when I'm in the area.
