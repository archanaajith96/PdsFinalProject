Not only do they have the best Fish & Chips have ever had... but there's a variety of all fresh options besides the traditional Cod staple. See the pics for the menu!! Such reasonable prices too. Attached is their main marker with fresh seafood... cheese.. wine pairings... smoked fish.... already cooked individual crabs... artisan aioli, sauces, breads and crackers... pretty much my version of heaven. I could easily, and very happily, spend all my money there! Check out the pics-- the evidence is overwhelming and honestly mind BLOWING #loveforEugene"}, {"review_id": "ydQt0KDd-GiZ49lf8LCZEw", "user_id": "vfUvHnqXndhTqMEDigY2mA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "Wow wow wow I love this place!

I am also not a fan of clam chowder after getting sick from it years ago at MO's, I had a bite here and it was actually pretty good. So way to go Newman's! A+! I had the halibut, and my guy had the red snapper. I tried a bite of his food, and wow! Amazing! I can't say that I like Newman's any better than Fisherman's market because I don't. I really like them both, and her is why. I think I like the halibut fish n chips better here, but I was not a fan of the oniony taste I got in each bite of tarter sauce here. I don't get that at the fisherman's market. Also at the fisherman's market you have a selection of different flavored tarter sauce. I didn't notice that here. I don't  necessarily like cocktail sauce with my fish, unless it is shrimp. I will go to either place depending on which place I am close to. They are both great."}, {"review_id": "pdU8KJZrOO4cSqkAZndDHw", "user_id": "aoJ1JDGx0-X_G208NryW-g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "The menu lists the Fish & Chips as a set number of pieced served with fries or cole slaw and has a separate list under \"Extra Fish,\" which should really be termed the \"a la carte\" menu to be less confusing. These items also come with (2) sauces of your choice. Not listed is the fact that you can actually get a half order of fries for $0.75, which is about the amount that you would get with the set meal. Not wanting to go overboard with the fried foods, I ordered 1 piece of cod (smaller than expected) and a half order of fries - the perfect amount to leave you wanting more, but not enough to feel sluggish postprandially. Other notes: - There is an outside window to order at - I appreciated how diligently they use the screen to prevent flies from going inside. - Limited outdoor seating, though there is a sign indicating that there are tables inside as well.- The parking lot is shared with Bier Stein but each has its own marked parking spots."}, {"review_id": "KxRSdIUM7Cep-CMPiiIpzw", "user_id": "j963DGqdep5pIjGIdWppTg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/18/2017", "text": "Halibut and salmon are a must try and the tarter is bomb.
