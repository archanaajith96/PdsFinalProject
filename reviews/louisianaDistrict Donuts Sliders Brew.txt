Because I totally freaking will. I did try a couple other things though so I'm comfortable with this rating. Did I mention this cinnamon roll is the best I've ever eaten? Maybe I should. Because it was amazing. And it's exactly 1829 miles away.  Agony.District Donuts is AMAZING. My only regret about this spot was that I ended up here after an awful eggs Benedict trio. I was pretty full since walking around the cemetery and neighborhood admiring beautiful homes for a couple hours wasn't magically making more room. Do you see all the donuts they offer?! Not to mention the rest of their menu. I wanted sliders and cheese fries. Next time.... My mother went with strawberry lemonade donut and I ordered a cinnamon roll. While the donut was good, the cinnamon roll was extraordinary. It looked a little sad just sitting on top of the case but I had faith. They serve them heated, the sugar on top caramelizing under the broiler, the icing melting a little which all adds up to the best cinnamon roll I've ever had. Perfection in a cinnamon roll has been found. I also ordered their elderflower lemonade. Delicious. Does it go with cinnamon rolls? Not at all, haha. But the flavor was spot on and it made for the perfect beverage to sip as I meandered around the Garden District on the way to a trolley stop. We arrived a little after 1pm and it was still bustling with people enjoying lunch and short line for people getting drinks and donuts to go. I'm so glad I insisted on stopping by this spot. One of the food highlights of my trip and a place you'll find locals enjoying themselves. No matter what you do order, don't pass up the cinnamon roll. Burger, fries, and cinnamon roll isn't too much. I believe in you."}, {"review_id": "k8wgvibkq4SvEPMPOda7Tw", "user_id": "xExFffLMwG2V6-709f3oFg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "They've got some fancy donuts here. Chocolate, peanut butter, banana something or other. That's the one I had. I just remember a doughy interior and those 3 flavors merging into one as I chomped. It was good. But you know what else is good? A simple chocolate glazed donut (no filling please) at the local donut shop where I live. I'm not one for fancy donuts.But the biscuit breakfast sandwich was what was great. I don't enjoy sweet things first thing in the morning, so if you're not a donut person, have no fear! There was runny scrambled eggs with melty cheese, stringy with each bite, sandwiched between a biscuit. The biscuit was buttery and flaky, toasted to perfection.The stumptown espresso was delicious - bold in flavor and body."}, {"review_id": "Iet9zJAlvz_mxBnf0XON2Q", "user_id": "7mWpCSYEqD5-E51n2uuMFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "The donuts and kolaches were great but we kept coming back for the coffee.

Let me tell you, I'm glad we did because their food is actually better than their donuts. We had their cheeseburger, fried chicken sandwich, and cheese fries. Both sandwiches were superb. I would go as far as to say it was one of the better burgers I can remember eating...and the same goes for the chicken. The donuts were good, but not amazing. I think all 4 of the donuts I tried were all a little on the doughy side for my tastes. I liked them well enough, but don't expect to be blown away.Prices were ok & the service was friendly enough. Solid little spot."}, {"review_id": "Qjefyg2zZlHmYrncD0Ezkg", "user_id": "f-iREBx-5CznQjIMWmoOkw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "3 Stars.District and fans, I am so so sorry. I did not have a fabulous experience at all. This is just my opinion and maybe I came on a bad day. I hesitated coming after reading a few reviews that were not 5 stars. District kept coming up on Yelp and the 4.5 Star review rating and 5 star pictures kept me drooling. I came. I really, really wanted to love it. I bought about 5 different things.The cinnamon roll I had was super dry. We took a road trip so there was no way to return it. The donuts are pretty and AOK. The hot chocolate was average. Everything was priced above average.I agree with Tiffany H's post. This is a must try place if you don't have \"gourmet\" donuts. But, Coming from the West Coast, we have super good donuts and coffee everywhere. From San Diego up through LA, SF, Portland and Seattle and I have had some pretty freakin good donuts and amazing coffee.I love New Orleans!! I love everything about it. I just had high expectations or came on a bad day."}, {"review_id": "WuId99LqQvFRAKmUYi5_yQ", "user_id": "_-Q9lDW-pZMR0C8Wg--giw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I am not a fan of donuts but there are so many other items on the menu. The veggie burger was so well spiced with crispy Havarti cheese that brought it to the next level. The fried chicken sandwich was also another great one with white meat of chicken - get the sliders if you want dark meat. The pimento cheese on the chicken sandwich gave it great flavor. The cheese fries was the right amount of salty and were not greasy. Of course the bruleed cinnamon roll cannot be missed! It is life changing. Perfect portion of dough vs glaze vs cinnamon. You must get it bruleed!"}, {"review_id": "oh43SDVg7rPxd58nr4UEGw", "user_id": "ZdizwYwPiIlhK3G2u-fZnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Afternoon snack attack! Gosh, all of the donuts behind the glass looked incredibly tempting but I ended up getting the vegetarian burger instead.It's one of the better non fake meat burgers I've had.

I love love love the donuts here. Ever since that fateful day when I encountered a box full of donuts on my cousins table, I made it mandatory that I make a trip over to district donuts every single time I visit my family in New Orleans. My cousin got four different kinds of donuts and I kid you not I ate about half of each donut and with the help from my aunt. The cream filled donuts are my favorite. I could eat two if I wanted to but I have restraint! And I say that because the donuts are huge. The donuts are on the pricey end but the size and the taste unequivocally makes up for it. King cake donut - on my most recent visit during Mardi Gras, of course I got the Mardi Gras themed one.  The distinct colors of green, purple, and gold with the traditional plastic baby sit on top of the donut and guess what, this donut is cream filled. Yasss hunnay. It's vanilla custard with specs of vanilla bean and it's not too sweet. Everything just works. Thai iced tea donut (I think)- guess what? This was cream filled too. I could definitely taste the Thai tea. The donut is light and fluffy. I don't think it's heavy at where it'll make you regret it later. Vietnamese iced coffee - I got this coffee because someone at a table couldn't recommend it enough. It's a tad bit sweet but the bitter notes of the coffee still came through. I hope you're not thinking I got two whole donuts to myself. I mean while I'm here about once a year, mine as well. Yolo. But I didn't eat it all myself. I did share, some.  The line is always long so be prepared to wait. I believe they change up their donut flavors daily so get your taste buds ready."}, {"review_id": "--xzxyDHmOXDfMfUAPAYPw", "user_id": "UfT3-quZcoOYtJFgVUm6iQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "I just hate that I've waited to let you know how freakin' delish this place was!! Don't think for a minute that it's only about the donuts...even tho they are absolutely worth every mouth-watering bite, try the chocolate turtle for a slow ride to choco heaven! But honestly lunch was scrumptious! I had the veggie burger, best ever with a beet-based patty. Then went all out and got the waffle fries nachos. Wait, what???? Yes, pretty good, but calling them nachos is reeally a stretch, especially for this south Texas girl!  Put this place on your \"must visit\" place in NOLA!!"}, {"review_id": "p8HoHer4nqJyot-5olpfdg", "user_id": "mGiUnXUc9iX_WAha4I5QNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "My mouth is already watering while thinking back to this place.After brunch, we headed over to District Donuts for some coffee.

We ordered the blueberry cheesecake donut and the raspberry champagne donut. Both equally gorgeous, but I'd go back for another raspberry champagne. The sweetness from the champagne pastry cream is balanced with the hardness from the raspberry. The blueberry cheesecake was good, but overall the note was all sweet."}, {"review_id": "i_AvEgkO52iBsFYHRNjjXA", "user_id": "iJ97UrvPlGNttp44qsJ-4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "If you've never had a \"spicy maple praline\" donut, you're missing out on quite an experience, as the thing delivered on the entirety of its name.
