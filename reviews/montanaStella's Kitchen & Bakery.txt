But the wait for food was ridiculous for breakfast. You wait about 45 minutes to an hour on a Sunday just to receive your breakfast meal. The eggs Benedict was absolutely horrible and could not finish it. The bacon and the wheat toast were alright. The coffee taste like water. And it is over priced for what it is. Just go to Denny's and save money."}, {"review_id": "GILsHCQbFT8RDJpnnpugtw", "user_id": "ZRnsUs9q6DbeJbOLjCY4ZA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/21/2017", "text": "Sitting here now with a beautiful cinnamon roll. No waffles here. What...? Oh well. Have asked for 2 eggs medium and a well browned pancake and ham. This sure appears to be the locals breakfast stop. Pancakes, ham and eggs are beautys. And..by far, the best pancakes I've ever had in a restaurant. Nice pint size pitcher of syrup also. Cool. Not 5 Stars only because no waffles here. Dang. Really is not fair because of it's setting and history.

We were just starting our late leg of our road trip. Needed something decadent and filling. Stella's exceeded our requests. Starting with coffee that was nice and medium. Stella's Surprise was a blast of flavor from starchy browns, grilled peppers, onions, and ham. All topped with some beautiful dairy and fried eggs. My tummy was in a delicious coma. Not to mention the huckleberry syrup with those home-battered flaps. Just put Montana on the map for me. Huckleberry Country indeed! If you're ever in the area like we were. It's not a bad spot to park your rear than this here place."}, {"review_id": "h8kwu89dmgr0tFECpoGYEg", "user_id": "-RbygmawBEWQVBNOkvl0uw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/12/2017", "text": "Homestyle food with great service.Driving through town, wanting to find a good home cooked meal.

I went for breakfast in May 2017 and for lunch in August 2017. Breakfast was a better experience and the French toast was good (but not amazing). The fresh squeezed orange juice was AWESOME though. We were seated immediately and experienced pretty good service. My lunch experience was less than stellar. Food was okay but the service was VERY VERY slow. We were wishing we'd picked somewhere else for lunch. The waitress was nice. I'm not sure what the problem was as the restaurant did not seem very busy.

In total, including coffee for both of us, the bill was under $30 so pretty reasonable prices. I will absolutely make it a point to visit Stella's any time I'm in Billings.
