The medium size comes with 2 scoops of different flavors. I got the white chocolate and raspberry flavor. Fruity and chocolate always mix well. It was rich, soft and creamy. Stop by to try some of their gelato. Their cannolis look hella good too, next time."}, {"review_id": "Rdg8aEmH1KnwvZin6Qo_xQ", "user_id": "D05jzLKZanNPQ-OJknvQAQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "This hole in the wall ice cream spot was perfect for a summer day! We walked in and were wowed by the sheer amount of flavors of gelato. After trying a bunch of them (the store workers were so patient), we finally decided on the Gorgeous, the Bacio, and the Sea Salt Caramel. All of them were amazing, with a creamy texture and balanced sweetness. In the end though, I think the Gorgeous won out as the family favorite. It was definitely a great afternoon treat!"}, {"review_id": "I58RP7tT5BPfHRbcy0S1Tw", "user_id": "ZKQeh2bLafGyGMTeZ2xoHw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "Gorgeous gelato seems to be very popular place in the old port Portland area. I had hopped in the place cos it was just in front my hotel. The place was very busy and crowded on Sunday night so there was no place for me to sit inside the Gorgeous Gelato. Also the queue was so big that we had to stand outdoors and took a while to get inside.The ice cream was very yummy I liked their hazelnut gelato, but I felt that their quantity was very less that thing disappointed. They have various flavors options. The Gelato are delicious creamy and softer. The service was efficient as the staff didn't hurry up he gave us time to Choose flavors as it was our first time at Gorgeous Gelato also we tasted few of the flavors. They seem to be pricey for the quantity they serve so I would check other ice cream places too. hence I would recommend this place for one time and I would also suggest looking around too.."}, {"review_id": "T4UD4IL1Oas1_6fr3TuSWw", "user_id": "tfBdA1jELmlYs_g61QeHLQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2017", "text": "Cute place! Very welcoming. There are sitting area: Very spacious. They serve gelato, pastries, drinks including alcohol. There are not a lot of gelato flavors to select from. However,  they have a good vegan selection if you are into that.I had the white chocolate and sea salt caramel. It was hard to differentiate between the flavors. They were very bland. Nonetheless, it was very creamy.Only negative or bad thing is the portion size is not big. Our scooper just put scoops on the top of the cup; felt like I had half air, half gelato."}, {"review_id": "7MLoOkgEIJu3kwLJv3Rprg", "user_id": "GPNqhNXBOV6SsSmnBrPPSw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2017", "text": "Came here on a Sunday Afternoon for an affogato. Their gelato is legit good! The affogato was fantastic. They had a nice selection of flavors and are generous with the sampling. I had the sea salt caramel and the gorgeous together in the affogato, with a nice oozing of whipped cream. Total cost came out to about $5, which, relative to other gelato places I've been to, is a decent price.The gelato is creamy and smooth like anything average gelato place you would walk up to in Italy.

The gelato here is awesome! I ordered the pistachio gelato, and the creaminess and sweetness was just right!The reason why I only gave three stars? At 9:50PM on a Wednesday night this place was already closed (no one at the counter) when I first attempted to visit. I realize that's only 10 minutes early, but considering it takes less than 5 minutes to put together a cone and run a credit card, it's worth it to stay open fully until 10PM!Edit: I see the business owner within a couple of minutes of posting has already written a comment about I need to be sensitive to the hospitality industry. It's interesting how the owner usually replies to your review if you give less than 4 stars, making me wonder if perhaps people who have given a lower rating have deleted their reviews, skewing this business' rating. I work in the medical field. When I worked at a private practice, phones weren't rolled over to the answering service until 5PM, end of discussion. Patients would have been upset if we had closed 10 minutes early. Instead of giving 3 stars, I give 2 stars for the terrible response, and I will not visit again especially since there's another gelato place across the street. If an employee is working a shift of 6 or 7 hours straight without a break, that is then the fault of the owner! This is also an OSHA violation since during an 8 hour shift, employees are entitled to two 15min breaks and one 30min lunch break. I used to be an OSHA compliance officer at a private practice; that is the law!Edit: The business owner continues to make harassing remarks. To assume I do not care about hardworking people is idiotic. I already stated I work in health care, so I guess the owner assumes health care workers aren't hardworking people. Not that it is anyone's business, but I work well over 40+ hours weekly and travel 100,000+ miles/year myself. The continued negative comments from the business owner show how this person treats his/her customers. One star it is!"}, {"review_id": "MwwE24ncVezswxi73dTCQg", "user_id": "NdSNQXoxiFeNZQ1M6uB9fA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/1/2017", "text": "This place was recommended to us by locals and it was delicious!

My friend went in while I sat across the street with my dog and she was able to sample a few flavors before deciding on 3 different flavors in a cup, their large size.Sour cherry, Gorgeous gelato and some chocolate that she couldn't remember the name exactly. The cherry was very flavorful, the gorgeous appears to be a vanilla base with caramel swirls and shaved dark chocolate pieces and the chocolate was very rich and decadent. After sharing the large (around $5.80), we were both satisfied but not bloated, which is sometimes the feeling we have after consuming dairy products.

So many vegan choices even on a normal day though. I'm not vegan but I did try a few of the vegan flavors and they were still delicious. I ended up going for the hazelnut and pistachio flavor. Both were fantastic. Located down the street from Central Provisions it was a great after dinner dessert or before dinner if you're waiting for a table. Lots of seating inside and they serve alcohol amongst other drinks as well as pastries. There's also free wifi which is always a bonus."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gorgeous-gelato-portland?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
