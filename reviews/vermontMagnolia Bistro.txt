I can't remember the last time I've had such accommodating and exceptional service then I was given here. Came with a friend, we actually went to Penny Cluse first , but that had a 45 minor wait!! Magnolia Bistro has no wait. I saw posts about a vegan cinnamon French toast, but when I asked our waitress about it, it wasn't on the menu.  She worked it out so I could have that instead of the regular bread with my sesame scram!!! It was DELICIOUS! Everyone was very nice there. I highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "8d2nLq6jXB09ghnRJPa--Q", "user_id": "K8bfA31Fw-_ETyapiPzWmg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "One of the specials was Blueberry Pancakes with a Lemon glaze, 2 eggs & bacon.  It wooed me away from my initial choice of Avocado Benny.

There are some really amazing restaurants in the immediate area and looking back, I wish I had gone elsewhere.The food was decent, but seemed more like what you'd find at a local diner. They make their own ketchup, it was okay - and the most interesting thing they offered. The part that really turned me off was their 2 dogs. Now I love dogs, I have one of my own and I think he's the best. However, not in a restaurant for breakfast...with them barking most times someone entered. Granted, they were on a leash and stayed in one area. I'd expect seeing dogs at a brewery, but it was just awkward here.The servers and hostess were friendly. I don't really know how else to describe it, but the entire experience just felt off."}, {"review_id": "GiAuZLZRTNM3i7Axoespgw", "user_id": "2p3NfylE1IZdp8wMPk2YJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "Aside from it being a little hard to find, we absolutely loved our experience at Magnolia Bistro! We were in town for just one day and found it via Foursquare. The service was lovely, the ambiance was warm and relaxed, and the food was way beyond what we expected. I got the maple sausage, apple, and cheddar omelette and it was fluffy, creamy, and perfectly seasoned. The hashbrowns were crispy and savory and the sourdough toast was great. They even had tasty iced decaf coffee which is pretty rare! I'm really glad we found it - it was a great way to start the day."}, {"review_id": "J89idnnFbIFizLotxdciRg", "user_id": "lNn7V9EZrLObnsb62HlBAg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/7/2017", "text": "An excellent find in Burlington, VT. It is a little difficult to locate, but we decided to look for it after reading Yelp reviews. First impressions of the interior was that it was dark and cold (gosh, that AC ...) playing music too loud for comfort. Then, we discovered that we could dine in the back yard, and decided to sit there. Best decision ever! It was quiet, sunny, quite relaxing, and we did enjoy our breakfast. Ah, the food: we tried breakfast  platters - scrambled eggs, hash brown potatoes, bacon and homemade bread. All nicely cooked and quite tasty. I have to admit it, I LOVED that bread! Portions were just right (not too big, not too small). We decided to go for an additional caloric splurge and have dessert. I tried their banana bread with the quite delicious raspberry cream cheese on the side. Only half a portion (to accompany my tea), and it was exactly what I needed. My friend had the yogurt parfait with granola and fresh fruit- nothing special, but still delicious. Overall, the staff were courteous, friendly and very accommodating, the lovely yard very inviting and the food as good as advertised. Four stars, because I suspect the experience wouldhave been quite different (and not as pleasant) if we had dined indoors..."}, {"review_id": "stpvPRvvLXJ_HBGKsUoERg", "user_id": "znLA_tWkHkMWjENJJa5C1A", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Basically everything that could possibly go wrong with a restaurant.  Constant turnover, inept staff, long wait times, cold food, overpriced, no parking.

We started our meal with the house made banana bread with cranberry cream cheese, and it was phenomenal! For my entree I chose the Huevos del Sol, made with local Vermont beef, and my companion chose the Crabcake Benedict. Both entrees were very substantial in size and flavor. The restaurant is very homey and comfortable, although on this hot summer morning it was almost uncomfortably stuffy inside due to a lack of fans and air conditioning. That would be my only negative comment on this establishment.Although we didn't try any, they offer an excellent selection of mimosas as well. All in all it was a tasty and enjoyable breakfast and I would most definitely go back to Magnolia Bistro on my next visit toBurlington!"}, {"review_id": "wuNr35KLtktDW8mcQLlV0A", "user_id": "HhSdTiQaeGcmDsh4QytCow", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "Extremely long wait to go here on weekends - we ended up waiting a little over an hour to get in. Service on arrival wasn't super fast, but wasn't bad either, and to be honest I don't really care about service speed. The issue was that the menu was pretty small and underwhelming.

The delay was well worth it: our choices were delicious; crab cake with eggs Benedict, hash browns, and a traditional breakfast with maple sausage . All exceptional and good value.
