I was not disappointed with anything i got from there, and now I'm just a little addicted to their boba tea.The employees are super nice, and they explain everything on the menu. At first i was skeptical because i only get boba from the boba place by my house since the quality is perfect over there + I've been going there since middle school. After trying it a couple times here i have learned to like it, it's a bit different, but it's refreshing and delicious."}, {"review_id": "C9Eu_-OhRrg4rKxSTeu3bw", "user_id": "LKe5xYLVQ08rhBRIww-YZQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Hmmmm. If I did this review back during my first visit, it would be 5 stars.. but they've changed..About a year ago, a Monster Box was a Sushi burrito, 4 pieces of Nigiri, and 2 potstickers for $9.99.. Fast forward to about 6 months ago, and the sushi burrito was $9.99 alone, with the Monster box coming in at $13 or so. That's cool. Inflation. I come in 2 weeks ago, and asked for the Monster Box. The lady who's ALWAYS at the register (more on her later), said they don't have that anymore, but she'll \"hook me up with it as a special.\" She rang me up. Came to over $16. She just charged me regular prices for all 3 items. That THREE price changes in less than a year. Not cool. Not consistent.Back to the lady. I understand she has to sell people on their product but she's literally borderline harassing. Twice in the past few months, me and my ex visited and she pushes and pushes and pushes their special rolls. Even after you tell her no, not interested, sure walks by asking, \"Are you sure?\" ...and even walked someone else's special past us to show us. We finally ordered it to shut her up. It was AMAZING! ..but that's besides the point. I eat sushi all over the country. Never am I pressured EVERY time I go. Even when ordering the Monster Box to go, she tries to get you to get the special. It's really annoying.Will I be back? Yep. I'm leaving here right now actually. Would I come a lot more if they had consistent pricing and the lady at front had a muzzle? Absolutely.Also: Call ahead. Twice in the past year, they were closed without notice, even though Store Hours sign said open.."}, {"review_id": "0OnJ0CD1uwPnmha_32XgUg", "user_id": "MUuGidmB2MTP2txqIEg9BA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Seems like their menu got cut short. I was craving for some sushi burrito and/or Korean fried chicken and since I am on a lunch break and this is the closest place to go I decided to come here. Walked in and went straight to the counter and I was given the menu expecting to order their lunch menu sushiritto and 5 (?) sushi combo. Apparently they no longer have this so I was a little disappointed. I asked if they have the KFC as well but they did not have it. I opted to order the bulgogi plate (~$10+) to go thinking that it would be tiny based on other people's photos. Opening it back in the office I was greeted by a cup of rice, seaweed salad, tamago , some dumplings and the bulgogi.Rice was done well, seaweed was not too dry or salty, but I wish I didn't get the cucumbers under it, the tamago was sweet, but dumplings was alright. The bulgogi though... I've had better. It wasn't badddd per se but it was just...bulgogi. What I usually see people get wrong is that the meat gets really hard and dry but Sushi Cafe didn't have that. The juices also seeps down and kind of mix in with the rice which I have no complaints about. I would suggest less... purple cabbage(?) as it had a very bitter taste to it... but that's just me. Kimchi would be nice toooo!All in all, I think I loved the seaweed the most. Will definitely need to try out the sushiritto later though."}, {"review_id": "-C7QBHyH3VQEeiM4sK1cuw", "user_id": "QcckMs29Z47tuSyWDCMUlA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "I have been here a handful of times now. This is a very casual sushi place, with clean and simple decor. While I have never actually tasted the fish, I have had their veggie rolls and custom vegan rolls they make for me. Those have all been delicious! Also, the price is really fair, sometimes when you customize an order it can be up charged quite a bit. That is not the case here at sushi Café, as they charge me about five dollars for a custom vegan sushi roll. I've had the edamame a few times as well, & it always comes out warm and with a good amount of salt on it. Yum!Their tea is also good. I like the way the seating is with the couches in the front for a relaxed ambiance. This is a very casual place so don't expect it to be trendy or high-end overpriced sushi. If you'd like a quick food stop with quick service and reasonable prices, then you should definitely check this place out."}, {"review_id": "Slf2n3gOVj11Pfb1UaG8Xg", "user_id": "TprC8sujz8MkwuomrqUSiw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/6/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Although you'll probably end up with something that's okay to eat, it's become basically impossible to know beforehand what you are ordering.We stopped by for dinner on a Monday evening. There was no one else there, so we were seated immediately.We'd been here before, but it seems many things have changed.Their menu is basically useless. There are no descriptions at all about what is in the dishes/rolls. And, unfortunately, our server's mastery of English was not good enough to explain what was in the food. They've also listed some roll names on their chalkboards, but again, no explanation of what they are and no prices.Ultimately, our food was just okay. There are other restaurants nearby with equal or better quality food where you know exactly what you are ordering. Unless they fix this critical problem I think Sushi Cafe might be in for tough times ahead."}, {"review_id": "mGgbdI5iJUDyCcGRVkE7-Q", "user_id": "k5QMjOiMRpbxEbAvOCcqCA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I love this place!

Right when I walked in, I already felt comfortable seeing lounge couches included as the dining seats. I had to take up this area good for 4 persons at a table. They have a back patio decor combined with Asian accents. Lighting is great along with the fixtures. I see that they have a sushi bar not in use and they should install bar stools along the counter. They can open up that concept to make the experience personal with the sushi chef.  I took a picture of the menu, so you could find it in the photos to pick out your options. Personally, I ordered the Bulgogi Box $9.00 which comes complete with rice, seaweed salad and tamago. I also added a shrimp tempura appetizer. My friends all did sushi roll orders that start at $5.95 The owner of the cafe complimented our lunch with a free waffle mochi ice cream w/ red bean paste and strawberry syrup toppings. He made our experience feel like top class!"}, {"review_id": "HfQzfINHpINNruE1J9ubww", "user_id": "BJvWjLVBB5rAK2apeFcmrQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Not coming back here!

May I suggest sushi in Henderson?Last weekend, after arriving in town, I learned my brother was also in Vegas for a friend's wedding. We decided to meet near where he was staying, which is how we all ended up at the Sushi Cafe in Henderson. Naturally, he previewed the restaurant and noticed it had really good reviews. Considering he lives in San Francisco and loves sushi, this was all the convincing I needed.The Sushi Cafe is in an interesting location in a strip mall, and it's nicely decorated. Right away, our group felt very comfortable in a clean, modern dining room that was nearly half full. Our server was very kind and took the time to answer our questions. I regret that I don't remember her name.Most of those in our group chose either the Bulgogi or Spicy Pork boxes. My brother took his own road and selected the Dragon Roll and Edamame. Everyone present enjoyed their meals. And my verdict is this: These are the BEST pot stickers I have ever tried, anywhere!The next time I'm in Vegas, I'm getting off the freeway at the Stephanie Street exit.

Looks cool, but makes the table uneven.  No biggie.  Plenty of seating but this might be one of those places where I'll be ordering for pickup vs eating in.Summary: A one stop place for Bento Boxes, Sushi (Nigiri and Rolls), Poki, and Sushi Burritos.  The offerings are extra af and I'm stoked to find this place.  I'll keep updating reviews as I keep trying new things. Good times coming. =)"}, {"review_id": "QCwVr-PsXMXrO7vEoBDyLQ", "user_id": "WPcEBAbrPZxvCGlvH9XLsQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/2/2017", "text": "I've had this place bookmarked for a while, but it's so far away from my house. Since I was on this side of town, I decided to stop by with my best friend. We came in around 6:45/7? On a Thursday night. It wasn't packed, probably 2 tables occupied. Their menu doesn't have a lot but I consider that a good thing. I opted for the tempura box & we shared a jackpot roll. She ordered the Korean BBQ box. I didn't expect to see a lot of food in the box that I ordered but, to my surprise, it came with other stuff besides the tempura & rice! It also had tamago, gyoza, seaweed salad, and pickled something. I didn't try the pickled thing but everything in my box was amazing. The tempura was plentiful and definitely wasn't too heavy. I wish they put furikake on the rice (maybe I'll ask for that next time). I tried her Korean BBQ & it was alright, nothing spectacular. The jackpot roll was really good! It had a little kick to it. Service was great! The server made sure our waters were always filled and asked us how everything was frequently. There are many Japanese/sushi places next to me so idk if I'd go all the way to the other side of town, but I'll definitely stop by if I'm around the area!"}, {"review_id": "MhUb9QvoDL9kGnvJzc_mdg", "user_id": "ATiE5_7Md8S3yO3CbEHXWQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "The service was great.

A SUSHI cafe, even! I was a bit thrown off by how we order. I thought they'd sit you first but you have to order first, and if you're eating \"for here\", they'll tell you to sit and they bring your food to you, then you pay when you're done eating. The only menu I saw were boards on the wall so it was hard to see what I was ordering. There were just names and I didn't know what was in any of the rolls. I had to depend on Yelp (thank you!). Service was great, though! The cashier/waitress was very friendly. The wait for our food wasn't too bad either. I ordered a combo bowl. I was hesitant about the price (~$12) but when I saw what was actually included in my bowl, I understood why. I got raw salmon, spicy tuna, surimi crab, seaweed salad, masago, avocado, ginger, rice, some greens, and probably other things that were hidden under everything else. I enjoyed by food and was happy to be bringing home leftovers. The price for a roll is pretty affordable and two rolls can fill you up. I'd definitely come here for rolls if I don't want to spend so much on AYCE. ~$4.50 for nigiri may be pushing it, so I'll probably do AYCE somewhere else for that."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-cafe-henderson?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
