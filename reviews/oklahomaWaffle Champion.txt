One of the best chicken and waffle sandwich I've ever had for sure.We were visiting OKC for the first time and I'm glad I found this place.The waffle was so tasty and cooked perfectly and the chicken was nice and crispy.We also tried their cereal milk which was pretty cool. Tasted like lucky charms milk lolThey also had different kinds of drinks, not just regular sodas.. sucks I wasn't able to get a photo of it. But I suggest just buy a drink and take a sip of each one to try it. Haha!

Their waffle is cooked to perfection and the honey that they drizzle on the side is to die for. I ended up getting the waffles, bacon, egg, and cheese. It was pretty solid, but I realized after I ate it that I would prefer to have all that separate from the waffle. Now that I know that, I'll definitely be ordering on the sweeter side of the menu with the waffle.

And it IS!!Small place so the seating is limited and tight which is a little annoying because syrup is sticky. Portion size is pretty good for the price but the mimosa are NOT worth the price at all. So stead away from the mimosas. Chicken and waffles is an obvious choice. How could it be bad? Waffle... Good. Fried Chicken... amazing. Syrup!!! What more can I say? The Migas is okay. Little underwhelming. And not my first choice. The Cinnamon Bun waffle dessert is similar to the Migas. Okay at best. The waffle is also NOT amazing by itself but with the chicken a home run. All in all good place worth the visit in OKC. On my next trip back out this will be a go-to place for me. At least once. I'll just be sticking with the chicken and waffle option."}, {"review_id": "ES6enfuspok7qXJYxsHmuA", "user_id": "h5hATRZRGeat13kbD9QxHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "The place was great for brunch. I was here with my friend around 12 ish and it was not super busy yet. I have been here couple of times before, but have not yet to get to try everything. Today, I tried the buttermilk and fried chicken, and the S'more. The buttermilk waffle with fried chicken was pretty good; however, i thought that they have put too much garlic on there. I thought that it could taste better without too much garlic on the waffle. The S'More was excellent tho. It came with the cream on the side, which gave that a good combination. The cream has cut down how sweet overall S'more was. I also decided to try cereal milk as well. It was good exotic drink. It was very creative! I love it. The service was always excellent, polite, and fast.Today (03/17/18)I came here for to order to-go. I was told that there is no way to call in and order and i have to stay in line to order the to-go. I just wish that this could run a bit faster. 1 cashier, many empty tables yet still have line wrap around the building. I still love the place just wish it could gone a little faster"}, {"review_id": "s0vs0jU-kwN80XbbDxexCw", "user_id": "GH1SEW5iTdE8pkJjGG35ww", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "This place is one of a kind in OKC. But I'll admit it is a little over hyped. Â I will easily defend my 4 star rating on quality, but it really isn't so original that I'm willing to give it 5 stars. The prices are also reasonable and even though there is always a line out the door, it didn't move all that slowly. They're almost at that Chick Fil A - lunch time level.Their waffles are a perfect combination of crispy and fluffy. Obviously they have to be a little thinner just so you can wrap it like a sandwich, but they still have that great consistency as if it was a big fluffy waffle. I usually get the bacon eggs and cheddar, and add some delicious syrup. The bacon is crispy and eggs fluffy, so I really can't complain. Once I try the chicken and waffles I'm afraid I might end up hooked. I feel bad for everyone telling me all about it and I'm never really in the mood for chicken. I'll make it a point to make that trip... and update this review."}, {"review_id": "Q16WVPJ7mY0CHF67SWfo1A", "user_id": "2-qk8ijAEjYszDZXwRmbQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "My daughter, her fiance, and I came here for a late brunch recently. It's a really busy place, but we got assigned a table and worked our way through the line pretty quickly. First up was drinks, and bloody marys were in order. My daughter chose a more traditional one, albeit stacked with bacon, a chicken tender, and other addons, while I tried the more exotic one with tomatillo instead of the normal tomato, Both were nice, had a good spice, and were kind of \"chunky\", but in a good way. For the food course, we chose a trio of waffles and shared them. From the daily special menu was the Nashville hot chicken waffle, served with pickle slaw and chicken tenders with that wonderful spicy brown sauce, wrapped in a nice Belgian waffle that had a little sweet, but not much. It was delicious, and should be a permanent part of the menu in my opinion. Next up was the standard menu \"chicken and waffles\", which featured crispy chicken tenders, crispy leeks, and a Tabasco honey drizzle. It was divine. Very delicious, and a great balance of savory and sweet. Finally, again from the specials menu, a tiramisu waffle featuring strawberries, fresh whipped cream, and an incredible espresso marscapone cheese. It was absolutely a knockout, with great textures and flavors, combined with the slightly sweet and crispy waffle. This place was really, really good. I'd highly recommend it for a hip brunch with friends or family!"}, {"review_id": "UeC22RJM_GuHWBHHBTYT6g", "user_id": "kUAmnDQ-7xT41MI4UUNb9A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "I call this place.

My friend and I split the Migas (savory) and Fool's Gold (sweet), and they were insane. My favorite was the Fool's Gold, as Waffle Champion has made an unbelievable concoction of waffles, strawberries, bacon, and peanut butter. Mind blown.

The Monte Cristo was straight-up bonkers, but what's really sticking with me days after is the super garlicky aioli that came with the waffle fries, which were the perfect combination of crispy-on-the-outside, creamy-on-the-inside that every waffle fry aspires to be one day."}, {"review_id": "e6x7WpOQHhCGEv6DdYENxg", "user_id": "nJ1WUaxa6BZnyEWy13KZnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Had to try the chicken and waffles.

A bit presumptuous to call themselves the champs eh? Although the name worked. It certainly caught my eye as I perused the handy dandy yelp app for brunch spots nearby. My next move, as it always is, was to check the photos! A few swipes and touches later and my eyes feast upon complete waffle madness. Savory concoctions and of course they sweets. My sister and I decided we should just go rather than sit in the car drooling at pictures. We hastily make our way, they close in 45 minutes! We found it with ease. Parking was another story, but not to worry, it was less of a hassle then I just made it sound. We walk in and are stopped in about two steps due to the line. That's a plus, a good sign as far as I'm concerned. The place was crack-a-lackin! It also smelled wonderful. A nice touch of sweetness, probably from the waffle batter gettin nice and crisp in their griddles. We looked at each other in excitement and pleasure from our choice. We knew we were in for a treat. We both grabbed a menu so that we could start studying our choices before reaching the counter. We found ourselves trying to read the menu and also look for seating. An empty table was a high commodity quickly being swooped up. Alas, to our surprise, they have someone for that. A waffle champ staff member kindly asked us how many in our party and assigned us a number of which we could find our table after we'd placed our order. Oh so clever and impressed I was. No hovering and making people feel uncomfortable or rushed because they are still eating and we want a place to sit. High five Waffle Champion, high five! So let's move on to the ever so important reason for our visit, and this review. The food. We decided, since I didn't live in OKC and my sister didn't know when she would be back, we better just get a little bit of everything. We got two savory waffles on the Classic buttermilk style waffle. As well as one sweet one for dessert. Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Migas were ordered along with a sweet Liege belgian style. As we looked around, we noticed the waffles were served wrapped up, almost cone like, or very similar to a handheld crepe. I had envisioned eating it with utensils, but, when in Rome. Our food arrives and they are carefully wrapped in paper making it easy to hold and devour in your hand. More cleverness to be had from this place. The only thing lacking was some heat. Some flavor. Some...Tapatio! I know, I know, I can't hardly expect much of that in Oklahoma. But, oh there is a but! We did luck out, there was a low shelf, kind of hard to find, even for us shorties, as it was just below hip level, and it had a small array of hot sauces. Eureka! Not exactly what I was looking for, but it did the trick. The chicken was tasty and not overcooked, the deep fried leek pieces were a nice touch and adding a drizzle of syrup to a bite, or not was just oh so satisfying. My sister's Miga's was on point too. Being wrapped up all hand held style really helped the eggs and chorrizo retain their heat well so it stayed warm and toasty the whole way through. They threw in some crunchy tortilla strips which really helped break up the texture a bit. How we had room for the sweet Liege, I'm not really sure. We didn't, we ended Â up taking half of it home with us! It was a much different texture. Not as soft as the classic so could not be wrapped up, this was served open face with a coating of powdered sugar and a generous splash of home made whipped cream. It was quite tasty. All and all, it was just what we were looking for. We left happy. Content tummies with refills of coffee for the rest of the afternoon ahead of us. The atmosphere was fun and chaotic, yet also pretty laid back too. The food was delicious, the perfect portion, and packed with flavor and made with love. I'm bummed I can't just plan to go for breakfast this weekend. Hmph! Next time I'm in Oklahoma...we will meet again."}, {"review_id": "iMHZfDrb97uJqkImCWoReg", "user_id": "0MFiXakgg3_W0Gmquloa2g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "6/19/2017", "text": "Pro tip: If you're not wanting people to know you're a doofus (like me), LiÃ¨ge waffles are pronounced like \"lee-Asia\" (without the \"uh\" at the end of \"Asia\") or \"lee-edge\" ...not liege like \"I live to serve, my liege\". You'll get a look from the cashier if you say it wrong (like me), like he's thinking \"What kind of ass backwards town you from? You're in Midtown now! Learn your Belgium-based cities, you yokel.\"So yeah, I've had both the Classic-style and LiÃ¨ge-style of waffles. I like the LiÃ¨ge waffles better, but they're also smaller so that's something to consider. As far as food goes, I've had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Ancho BBQ Pulled Pork, and Bacon Egg and Cheddar waffles, as well as their waffles fries with truffle mayo and homemade ketchup.Even after all these visits...I still don't quite get it. Yes, the food is tasty...but I don't think it's omgggghhnngg-great like most other people think it is. Maybe it's the experience of the whole thing? You know, the whole try-to-find-a-parking-spot-that-isn't-reserved experience. Or the wait-in-line-outside-for-twenty-minutes experience. Or maybe it's the this-is-in-Midtown-so-it-has-to-be-amazing experience. Not sure, but I think the hype for this place is a little crazy.I will say, the people working there are mostly very friendly and helpful. And I do like the strange things they put on their waffles. You'd think most of these food combos wouldn't work, but they do. Also, I used to love that truffle mayo but now it's starting to taste musky and gasoline-y. That may be just me. Oh and, $10 for a bacon, egg, and cheese waffle? What, is this cheese coming in from France or Tillamook, Oregon or something? Oh it is? From Tillamook, eh?
