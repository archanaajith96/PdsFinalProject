Found this gem shortly after they first opened & have been a regular ever since! FEP makes you feel as though you are one of the \"fam\" & go the extra mile to make sure your visit is nothing but the best! Pizza is unique & delicious, personal favs are the salad pizza (ask for a side of the balsamic reduction they bring the whole bottle which is amazing in my book), Mackenzie Rose, Spinach Artichoke, Mashed Potatoe--the list goes on! The eggplant rollatini to start is another fav-highly recommend! Plenty of specialty drinks that are always switching up! From happy hours, to private parties to a quiet dinner for two--no complaints here, staff & management are always on point--thanks Phil & Marty!"}, {"review_id": "gIfZ_i6K8RYAge6A4e3T5w", "user_id": "C5BSOGwIlkba1fg_dhd8tw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "This the best pizza shop ever and their drinks ate so good.

My gluten-free crust came out unappealingly soggy and when I was asked \"How's your pizza?\" by the server, I answered honestly and she whisked it away back to the kitchen where the chef then sliced it up and burnt it in the oven in the process of trying to crisp it up.I would've been better off not telling the truth. Perhaps they have a new chef?"}, {"review_id": "V1Dm89M6KN9atm_YSSe0eg", "user_id": "gsIpUGKzBA2uok5BNT2g-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "My wife insisted I eat here, said it was the best pizza.

This place is adorable. I love the décor and the atmosphere walking in. People are happy and really loud. Seating is a bit crowded but I actually didn't mind it. We were quickly greeted and found a table for three on a Friday night, day before St. Paddy's Day where every place we tried beforehand had an hour wait or more. The broccoli rabe/sausage appetizer was fantastic and enough for three to try. I ordered the Black Rock Cobb Salad with chicken which was plentiful but my chicken was sadly really dry. However, the $8.00 (!!) Sea Hag washed it down nicely. My daughter ordered the Antioxidant Bowl (what even is this?) and loved it. Husband ordered the small clams casino pizza and pretty much enjoyed it however the middle was really soggy. I picked up a slice to try and the topping dripped off all over me cuz the slice sagged in half and the slice was not very big! If you go and order a large, you will have to use a plate and pull it apart with a fork. Not my kind of pizza. Need my pizza to be crispy on the bottom. Bill comes and husbands eyes bulged out. $130 for a shared appetizer, pizza, two salads and a few Sea Hags. That's nuts!"}, {"review_id": "iKRgm2iSRbFYuJoGWISjnA", "user_id": "SnADOXFJ9lp7U5SXduIJsw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/10/2017", "text": "Best pizza in Black Rock. True artistry. Awesome atmosphere.

Not great, not the worst I ever had. My typical test a place out large plain pizza... so I can taste their crust/sauce/cheese without any competing flavors. Hit me kind of expensive for what it was really. The fire engine gimmick is cute and all, but Fairfield and New Haven counties are screaming hot with great pizza places so better can be had for less.. That's my personal opinion."}, {"review_id": "xEBzN0g0f6rv-HKhKV7z2g", "user_id": "SmvXtsIwe4DqgiLpXgQfmw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/2/2017", "text": "Is this pizza hut?(But in all seriousness I actually really love Fire Engine Pizza. There's good customer service, nice waiters, and delicious food. My Favorite food option there is the Firehouse Fries. Spiced fries with 3 dipping sauces, ketchup [with a spicy kick to it], honey mustard [I think, but I don't care what it is, it tastes good], and ranch [which also has a spicy kick to it].

I had a slice of spinach dip pizza and it was SO good and also very, very rich so I probably couldn't have done more than 1 slice! I've also catered with the Fire Engine Pizza Truck, and it was fantastic. Very good food, easy to book and pay (weirdly not true with all caterers). I can't speak to their bar or restaurant staff, but the catering staff is great, very kind and hard-working. They kept making pizzas until every scrap was gone and the event was packed up!"}, {"review_id": "htxie60txUol0H0nbEm6iw", "user_id": "1DhKvepHRNKs3aUw6NSOKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/12/2016", "text": "Blackrock's best pizza. Sometimes hard to find a table, but definitely worth the wait.This place has fantastic pizza, from the crust which is crunchy and not too thin, to the toppings that are fresh, tasty, & home made. I've been there a few times, and definitely recommend the mashed potatoes/caramelized onions/meatballs pizza, which has exceeded all expectations & has become one of my favorites. We had a side of salad as well which was ok but nothing compared to the pizza.Note : don't go there if you're in a rush or short on time. The staff is super nice, but service is slow, need to give your pizza some time to cook!
