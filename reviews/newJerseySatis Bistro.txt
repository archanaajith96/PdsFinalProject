For dessert we split a creme brûlée which was also great.  Overall, a nice experience"}, {"review_id": "10ZQtHRLpADJy6TO5kkWLg", "user_id": "bEcQSVxYm3CLWJ79r-NXew", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "They messed it up. Used to be my favorite brunch spot in Jersey City - specifically because of how nice the charcuterie menu was. You could order individual meats as appetizers that would come with artisanal bread and jam, it was small, delicious and perfect. That's all changed. Now they only offer a $29 chef's choice charcuterie platter. Way too expensive - and you don't even get to choose your meats.Also, a bit of advice - if your bus boy spills ice water all over a patron, the least you could do is comp a drink, just saying. Probably the last time I go, the whole experience today bummed me out :("}, {"review_id": "4bfA1Vc7T6RC74Cs8dbBpg", "user_id": "FfWa4mGgFrDtx36YRwYSpA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "I took my wife here for her birthday.

We decided it would be a special place to celebrate our anniversary this year so we made a reservation several weeks in advance. When we showed up on the night of our anniversary, we were 5 minutes early, and our table wasn't ready. We were sent to the bar, ordered a drink, and a half hour later, I went back to the entrance to ask the hostess if our table was ready. It was, but why did no one come and tell us? Also, why was our table not ready at the time of reservation, let alone 30 minutes late? Definitely subtracting points for that.We ordered the Patatas Bravas as a starter and the Butternut Squash Wellington and Black Angus Hanger Steak as entrees. The Patatas Bravas were definitely our favorite part of the meal. The potatoes were crispy and the sauce was on point. The Butternut Squash Wellington wasn't quite as expected. It was really heavy on the goat cheese and the crust, so it really felt like I was eating a goat-cheese-filled pastry (not like that's a bad thing, just not what I was expecting). The veggies didn't really come through, which I wish they did. Was hoping for a slightly healthier and less heavy vegetarian option. The Black Angus Hanger Steak fell short by a lot. Typically when you order a steak, you get a steak. At Satis, apparently when you order a steak, you get a plate of french fries and a few cubes of meat. It was a big disappointment for a $30 entree, and on top of that, the truffle butter didn't really work well with the meat. Maybe it was to conceal how dry it was. On top of it all, we really did not feel that we got the service of a 4-star restaurant. In addition to waiting 30 minutes for our reserved table, we didn't feel like the servers paid us much attention. We might be young, but our money is as valuable as anyone else's. The table next to us was getting special attention to the point that the server recommended a dish so heavily that he offered the woman to try it and if she didn't like it they would make her something else at no extra charge. Great for them, but we could hear him over at our table 6 inches away. Definitely won't be back for a special occasion again, if we're back at all."}, {"review_id": "6as_ZMCkxXbw80_B8hsD3Q", "user_id": "x1ZeQbGxfTPZ2BM0VcWs9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "This is my go-to place whenever I'm looking to grab a quick drink or a dinner on a special occasion with my partner.The bar's got ample space to get a drink and while there's enough seating at the restaurant as well, I'd highly recommend making a reservation if you wanna beat the waiting time on a Friday / Saturday night !! Amongst the positives, there are a decent number of options for vegetarians .Amongst the drinks, my personal favorites are the cider and the gimlet.Also, there's plenty of outdoor seating during the summer and while I'm yet to try this place out for brunch, it already stands as my personal favorite in the Paulus Hook Area especially for it's ambience and decor.Will be back very soon :)"}, {"review_id": "nGJPKavgUjjEc77UugYtdw", "user_id": "G9D8fK_ffX1q9kO9i-6_KQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "Super loungey vibes and intimate setting - despite having plenty of room in here!  I came here with 2 friends for dinner on a slow Tuesday night; it was wonderful!  The place itself had low key lighting, booths and pillows strewn about, beautiful stemware, and white tablecloths.  A very subtly sexy vibe given off indeed! Would be a great date-night location!We ordered a drink while we waited for one of our friends, a Hendrix Cucumber Gimlet, made beautifully, even served with a cucumber garnish.  The drink was definitely strong, yet fresh - a perfect cocktail!   One of our friends was running late, but our servers were super friendly and nice about it!  Once she got there we naturally got to talking, but eventually ordered! We stared 2 starters, the empanadas and the arancini.  The Empanadas were so good!  It was a braised Kale, chickpea, and mahon empanada served with spicy Romesco sauce and toasted almond.  The kale came through, as well as the earthiness of the chickpeas - really interesting twist on a traditional empanada!  The arancini was also reimagined, butternut squash and fontina arancini, served with brown butter aioli and cranberry mostarda.  The cranberry mostarda was super strong and tart-  but I truthfully enjoyed the arancini more without it!For dinner I ordered pasta (because it was cold outside!!).  I opted for the Campanelle with came with fennel braised Broccoli Rabe, homemade sausage, roasted Tomato, and mozz cheese.  The sausage was delicious, but the portion was crazy off - when I finished my dish, I had a heaping mound of sausage left - definitely not stingy on the portions!!Naturallllly we had to try the desserts, you know, for science.  We ordered the Flourless chocolate torte, as well as the bread pudding.  I'm not the biggest fan of bread pudding but it looked great! Also, the chocolate torte was good, but nothing to knock-your-pants-off.  And, believe me, when I see that dark chocolate in front of me, I want it to be so rich it DOES knock my pants off...Overall super cute place, I would definitely come back to try out more of the menu!"}, {"review_id": "x_d8NTVoc1w6NBCZoLXcDw", "user_id": "6l4JNWx3Pdc8muHrU7suMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Jersey City.

Delicious food offerings and delightful cocktail and wine choices. On a chilly Jersey City night, early to meet colleagues for dinner, I peered into Satis from the sidewalk. The sign on the main door indicated a private party, but the downstairs bar door showed it was open for business. So, I bellied up and perused the cocktail list. I decided to \"Feel the Beet\" and ordered their concoction of gin, rosemary, orange, and beet juice. I mean, hey, beets are a superfood! It was refreshing and well crafted with fresh ingredients.Finally sitting down to dinner, we sampled a charcuterie board that pleased practically everyone. I opted for the cast iron roasted half chicken with Brussels sprouts and leeks. It was superb and tender, and also visually appealing. They've also got a bowl of mussels that looked tremendous, though everything appeared to be very tasty. The ambience is old-timey and vintage. Cool older photographs and posters on the wall. The ceilings are high and it's big enough for a party, while small enough for an intimate dinner. I highly recommend the restaurant for entertaining colleagues and clients, and the bar is quaint for catching up with old friends or escaping the work week.

Theo was great helped us immensely with these tough menu options!  If I had to leave something negative about this place...it would have to be there wooden chairs. The decor is great but these chairs curve up and back and have absolutely no support, leaving the costumer forced to lean over for the entirety of the meal.

Had been dying to come here for around a year and just never got around to it! Went on a double date for dinner on a Friday with an 8pm res. There was a table almost getting up when we arrived so we waited at the bar and got cocktails for ~15-20 min while we waited for the table to get cleared. The 4 of us had the spicy limonada cocktails (tequila, lemonade, jalapeño, agave nectar), which were soooo good. Not too spicy and not too syrupy/sugary, just right and refreshing.When the table was ready, we were pretty ravenous and knew exactly what we wanted. We split a charcuterie board to start (3 cheeses - manchego, goat, 3 creams/3 meats - sorpressata, chorizo secco, proscuitto) that also came with mini pickles, apricot jam, fig spread, and bread. At first, there were only 6-7 slices of bread so we had to ask for more since our board was pretty large. Great quality meat and cheeses, but a tad pricy ($57).We then split a bottle of chianti that was awesome for the low price ($42). The gals in the group ordered pasta entrees - campanile with broccoli rage and sausage and ricotta (not much ricotta) and the spaghetti e vongole (seemed like it was a bit spicy). The boys got the mussels (enormous pot with probably ~50 mussels) with frites and then the 1/2 roasted chicken with a sub for goat cheese chorizo mash potatoes instead of the tuscan bean salad. Everyone really enjoyed their dishes!Ambiance was great. Dimly lit, crowded but still relatively quiet. Overall bill for 4 was $200 pre-tip. Will definitely be back as it is the perfect date spot.

There were wedding and baby shower parties that booked the restaurant, so al fresco seemed to be the only option. We were a party of six, so we had to wait 10-15 minutes while they cleared the tables. Drink orders were taken promptly and soon after, we put in our brunch orders. That was when everything went to hell. We watched as several other folks got seated around us. Then their orders were taken. Minutes passed and then they started receiving food. We put in two appetizer orders: a cheese and meat charcuterie board. 15, 20, 30 minutes passed. No sign of food. We looked for our waiter but he seemed to be avoiding us. No \"Sorry, you food is coming out shortly\". After 45 minutes, the charcuterie boards come out. They took 45 minutes to slice salami, cheese and bread. The entrees came out another half hour later, lukewarm at best. The food tasted ok, but portions are date-sized, when you don't want to look like a pig. If you're hungry or in a hurry, this is not the place you want to go to. So, no apologies for the extra long wait, no comps on anything, in fact, no free refills on the small, iced filled $3 sodas. And to top it off, they automatically added an 18% gratuity. If you're thinking of trying this place, do yourself a favor and don't."}, {"review_id": "rsUI5QOoDsCGmulT4ahmrw", "user_id": "qs4kM3kgCixzNBP_4sAhVg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "After many meals at Satis I think my favorites are for brunch.

I ordered the prix-fixe menu ($35) with the tomato bisque, short ribs, and German chocolate sundae. I was pretty unimpressed with all my choice. The tomato bisque was VERY thick like the consistency of baby food. It lacked salt. I love tomato bisque normally, but did not care much for this. It was a yellow color (supposed to be) that had some sweet notes due to the corn.My short ribs with goat cheese mashed potatoes were severely underwhelming. The short ribs were bland and not very tender. The potatoes were very lumpy missing some creaminess. Not sure if the goat cheese was supposed to help.. but it wasn't a great mashed potato (reco: don't spend extra to get this). Also it didn't have much of a chorizo flavor.  Looking at the menu I'm surprised it was supposed to be there.My husband got the prawn and lobster risotto. I will say he LOVED the flavor of the risotto (he finished it!) But noted that the prawns were obviously frozen and not fresh. He rated his meal 4/5. We did love the German chocolate sundae but would not likely pay $8 for it.My server was also extremely slow and nor very helpful! The hostess had alerted us to entrees that may no longer be available.  The server made no mention of these! No helpful suggestions, no specials, nothing! He didn't even check on us right away after receiving our food. It took him 15 mins. to check on us... glad there was salt at the table next to ours or I would have been waiting a while!Due to mixed results this would be  2.5 or 3 out of 5 stars."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/satis-bistro-jersey-city?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
