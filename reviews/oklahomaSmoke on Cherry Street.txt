Dark wood, fancy waiters, and a private cigar smoking lounge await you.Parking is difficult in this area, I recommend taking a Lyft.There are so many fun things on the menu, but I ordered the steak and it was PERFECT. We split a cheese board at the table and it was really good too.Only negative is, we never got bread, so my cheat meal was unsatisfied on the carb front! They do have complimentary bread baskets, so not sure what happened."}, {"review_id": "9Js5wNoNGFx08Q7U6Kal2w", "user_id": "9hBGfpru1ytlpHrUpzCi2w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "Pros: Very innovative brunch menu for a small city restaurant. I texted a friend that I was having brunch and that I ordered a malted waffle, chicken fried bacon, and bacon jam. She mistakenly thought I was dining somewhere out of town. The waffle and corn bread muffins were delicious and came with this very interesting butter. The chicken fried bacon came with this yummy sauce that redeemed the whole dish. The decor was trendy. The service was spot on. Wish I could have order off the extensive drinks menu, but had a meeting scheduled afterwards. Huge portions. Accepts credit cards. Cons: overall, my friend and I agreed that this wasn't a brunch we'd be craving, but wouldn't mind accompanying someone if they wanted to come. The bacon wasn't quite what I was used to. More a European style than the American way that I prefer. Brunch is actually way better than their lunch. I've eaten lunch here several times with my husband. Usually very high fat and filling meals, but food unremarkable. Private parking lot to the side with limited space."}, {"review_id": "rZO8-ezfN_BHrt0FVfCXbA", "user_id": "YvUAzcIZmyJHoTZmuZUUKA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "I now know Cherry Street is chock full of a boatload of hipster coffee shops, bars and dinner hot spots...but...don't miss out on not only the FOOD but the BEER.  OMG.  I never thought I would say this...as I'm a well-touted wine junkie who's barely tolerant of hops-based beverages...but this might have changed my stubborn wino mind.The Prairie Bomb is a darker stout that is dripping in not-so-subtle tones of COFFEE (my 2nd-favorite beverage behind red wine) and am guessing, molasses (?).  It has layer upon layer of complex flavors that wash over your tongue in slow, measured waves.  It's a sensual masterpiece.  Definitely a sipping beer...don't waste the experience on gulps! Was also advised that Prairie is brewed each year at the holidays with a special blend that is specific to that year and changed each year thereafter.  I'm seriously thinking we need to go to Tulsa one Christmas just see what the brewmaster cooks up for this batch.  The beer is THAT good.Okay, now that I've broken tradition of dishing on the food first, I can't leave out the FOOD!  A co-worker had recommended we have a team dinner there as she had tried it the night before and extolled the virtues of the Pimento Cheese Grits.  Not the meats, not the alcohol, but the grits.  I was intrigued as I truly appreciate the finer notes of Southern cuisine and grits is definitely a simple, but overlooked side, most times.  So I ordered the one and only dish that had these special grits as its accompaniment...the Pork Brisket.  While the Brisket was nicely flavored and tasty, the grits and the greens (best I've ever eaten) were the standouts there.  I could eat bowls of those grits and greens every night.  Not a bad meal was had by any in our dinner party...and our normally raucous bunch was rather quiet...fully engrossed in the taste experiences we all had.  And the ambiance and service were stellar.  Oh and the waiter was cute with his little pony tail swinging in the breeze, and the flirty smile that will sell lots of Prairie Bombs.  We're all going back next month for work and we WILL be back to get more Smoke!"}, {"review_id": "4_7WlklBlzE79u7MlL_3fQ", "user_id": "0lQoOUBskMjFLACajlWLXw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "For all th hype I was SOOOOOO disappointed in our meal.

Gravy and biscuits must be different consistency,Not the same. Not to mention it tasted like literally nothing. Not even salt. What did I just eat? Pineapple basil mimosa was amazing except I only got like half a champagne glass, not even a full pour like you get at every other brunch spot on earth. My girlfriend had the wet burrito. It tasted like they had dumped 37 pounds of chili powder in it. That is literally all you could taste was chili powder. The only saving grace was our waitress who was super amazing and attentive. 10/10 on service -10/10 on food and drink. Will not be back.

Which is rare because usually a restaurant or establishment doesn't always live up to the hype.Smoke on Cherry Street does. Big time. If you want the true definition of food porn, come here. I've never had such a good burger! It was perfectly cooked at medium with spicy mustard and thick, rich cheese. The fries are crispy and delicious. They were out of this world awesome, but heavy on the spice. I could only eat a few due to them being so spicy.The waitress recommended the Cabernet Sauvignon and I can see why. It was bold and hearty tasting. It went down smooth. At 7.00 it wasn't a bad deal.

I'd recommend getting a reservation in advance to avoid having to wait. Drink prices are on point and plenty of variety available. Food menu has really good variety as well. Brunch items and lunch items because what you should eat from 10am to 3pm is open to interpretation ;)Love the atmosphere here! Upscale but not in a way that's intimidating. Very cool decor and vibes. The bar area looked very chill so I'll have to come back and check it out.Brunch started with uniquely flavored corn muffins and spiced butter (I asked what was in both but I've already forgotten). Coffee was good and paired perfectly with the chicken and waffles. When I say chicken and waffles you may think of a basic breakfast/brunch menu item but Smoke has really stepped up the chicken and waffles game with buttermilk fried chicken breast, maple syrup, spiced butter and sausage gravy. For the lunch-goers, you must try the Smoked Trout Salad. I was doubtful at first, but my mom has been raving about this salad for months so when she got it at brunch I had to try a bite. I must say I see why she's been raving about it. It comes with smoked trout, mixed greens, candied pecans, crisp apple, goats' cheese, dried cranberries and Tabasco-maple vinaigrette. I'm not usually a fan of goats' chesse, but with that dressing on it, I'd probably eat just about anything.Only complaint is there was no actual sugar free sweetener option (my mother is a diabetic) for the coffee/unsweetened iced tea. They did have a green packet claiming to be Stevia, but the first ingredient listed on it was dextrose (aka sugar). I mentioned this to the manager on the way out and he was very friendly and apologetic and said he'd talk to his boss about it so I anticipate this will be fixed soon. No hard feelings about it, but it did color our experience so I had to mention it. Also on the way out I spied with my little eye some type of pickle/olive bar in the bar area. I will definitely be back to partake in that and try more things on the menu. Will update review with more deets next time I come back!"}, {"review_id": "J60wdf3vw12BssO2OsHeog", "user_id": "AO-1OS007hKXceKTVSZE6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Wow!

The food (and management) though need some attention. The brunch begins with the server dropping off a basket of dry, tasteless muffins, and it goes downhill from there. My eggs were undercooked and runny, the bacon was cold and chewy to the point of being inedible, and the potatoes were obviously warmed-up from the night before. When the server asked me how everything was I showed him my plate (with almost all the food sitting there untouched) and said, \"awful.\"He apologized. And charged me for everything.

Intimate and urban feels upscale yet not pretentious! The service is fantastic! They know their foods and very friendly. They make sure you have what you need without hovering. Beware-they serve amazing breads with special butters and spreads like a Mexican restaurant serves chips and salsa. We ordered the bread board not knowing this so have an abundance of bread and spread! We had the gnocchi with chicken! It just melts in your mouth! The flavors are incredible, perfect balance. We topped it with a shared slice of peanut butter chocolate pie! Out of this world! And definitely worth ordering but for sure shared as rich and big dessert!
