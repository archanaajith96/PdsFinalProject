A (South African) Pie is an individual meal-sized portion, usually made with flaky pastry crust enclosing a savory filling such as thick chicken and veg gravy, a chunky and thick pepper steak gravy, etc.   Imagine a mini-Chicken Pot Pie for one, but MUCH more delicious.  Pie Boss makes these South African's PIEs to perfection, (some might say even better than in South Africa) because it's clear they use the best ingredients one can find.   Part of the appeal / success of Pies is the ability to make them in advance and then bake from frozen - This means best results are achieved if a little \"planning\" is added to your meal time.  Call ahead and find out what is available upon arrival, or place an order (that usually is ready within 20 to 30 minutes) - Pie Boss however usually has two or three Pie's already warmed and ready for immediate joy if you find yourself in the area and simply can't wait :)  These Pies are also great to purchase and take home for a delicious meal and as they're already frozen and the individual size make portioning super easy.

Unfortunately I stopped in the last night I was in town and I regret that because there's at least two previous meals I should have substituted with Pie Boss. As the snow started coming down, huge magical flakes too, I thought it was perfect weather for hot pies from their case to take home to share some of my family. Now out in San Diego I have these South African pies all year round from a place called Perky's but I have to say Pie Boss does it better. The flavor profiles, the amount of moisture in the filling, and the crust are all better at Pie Boss.I didn't order ahead because I was totally fine with just taking them home frozen if the freshly baked in the case were all sold out. Pie Boss includes a little card with baking instructions but I think that their oven gets these pies more magically brown and delicious than my mother's did. The beef pasty was still okay baked at home, just a little paler than the others. It has a delicious filling of beef, potatoes, and carrots. You can't go wrong with a beef stew baked inside a flaky crust. Well you could, but Pie Boss has it worked out. If you're going for visual perfection- order ahead.From the hot case I picked out two pepper steak pies and 1 spicy chicken pie. The pepper steak has always been my favorite South African pie and Pie Boss turns out a perfect one. The crust on these little pot pies isn't soggy (inside or out, not even the bottom where it can be tricky) and it flakes nicely. The spicy chicken, aka chicken curry, has a nice little kick but nothing too crazy and the spices are balanced. Perky's, I'm sad to say, frequently has soggy crust and the chicken curry is overwhelmed by giant shards of bay leaves. I'll think of Pie Boss fondly while I eat less tasty pies here. Unless Ty ships his delightful pies? Well a girl can dream and hope to head back to IL sooner rather than later for more pie."}, {"review_id": "B8TNw-bUK3d7pH9VhgzCyA", "user_id": "qdL8653v-rHWMDIw69hnrg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Amazing.  So good.

So this Friday I reached this place 15 mins before its closing time. (Note: This place closes at 7 and is closed on Sundays.). I was welcomed by a nice aroma of freshly baked pies. Now how it works here is slightly different so read carefully You can order your favorite pie 20-30 minutes before you arrive here and they will freshly bake the pie for you. You can also choose to pick a pie from the small selection of already baked pies or take a frozen pie home and bake it yourself. Since I dint know how this worked beforehand, I only had the option of selecting something from their already baked options. I chose the peri peri chicken and chocolate custard pie. Both the pies were fresh and delicious. I was slightly disappointed by the Peri Peri pie, partially because i had the Nando's peri peri chicken in mind, which tastes very different. So don't compare it with that. Enjoy your pies!!!!!!!"}, {"review_id": "N_5iWVKMww-hsqNr4pVgtA", "user_id": "mXTK8wmr3UHkLedw5eDAlw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "I have only been here twice but from what I had, the food was great. As I recall though, the price was quite high for a family to eat. I had the Lamb pie twice and strongly recommend it. For a family of 5 I believe the price was right around the $55 mark. I strongly urge the owner to advertise more. As I said, the food was great, but not many people know about this place because it is tucked into a strip mall. If the owner started going into all the local businesses and offer employee discounts that would be, in my opinion, brilliant. Also, I think that this location would do outstanding if they offered delivery! There is a lot of opportunity here."}, {"review_id": "s1P6OjFNJjAXdD7_ppot7A", "user_id": "xkDKARRl0scCiuTsq6_LKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2017", "text": "I foolishly had ignored my sister-in-law's recommendation to try this unusually structured restaurant for at least a year. I had a beef pasty that was excellent -- the crust was, I'd have to say, perfect. There's a broad selection of savory pies.

I'm almost afraid to get something else because I don't want to miss out...So it was good that I finally brought my parents with me so I could taste their (different) pies and try something new! Mom got the chicken and mushroom and Dad got the ham and cheese. While both were tasty, my heart still belongs to pepper steak!We also got the mini dessert pies: mine, the vanilla custard liberally sprinkled with cinnamon, reminded me of horchata, the Mexican rice milk drink, yum! This is a unique and affordable dinner option for the whole family.

I tried a chicken and mushroom pie and steak one as well. The pie crust is so flaky and buttery! Loved it! Also, had a mini cherry pie for dessert. Easily, the best dessert I have had in a long time. I don't even like cherries that much!Everything was really reasonably priced. One downside would be that not all the pies are ready and up for order. If you want to eat on the spot you just have to choose from a more limited selection.

I think Ty thought I was joking when I suggested he open a 2nd location in Northwest Indiana somewhere.    But he does offer shipping options for his pies if I'm not inclined to drive the 80 minutes or so needed to get to Pie Boss once I move.   So hope is not lost."}, {"review_id": "gQ265CucRpICCeatCzjERw", "user_id": "CSRTG6ciqjDGS5_0qxR9fQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "First time trying this type of food, these pies were incredible.

The decor is very cute and simplistic. The owner is a multi tasker, he handles and runs everything him self. He has some ready to go pies available and if you want something really freah he ask to call in at least thirty minutes.I happened to get the spicy chicken pot pie and beef pasty. The spicy chicken is full of curry spice type flavors which were pretty good. The beef pasty was like a ground beef and potatoes in a handle held pie. The crust of both were outstanding and so delishous. The only thing is that even though they were delightful, if I come in again i wouldn't be bothered if they weren't on the menu.
