Parlor Market let us know from the first bite that they weren't going to break that streak.We started with a special salad consisting of fresh strawberries, candied almonds, goat cheese and greens and every bite was spectacular, one of the best versions of that salad I ever had.  I followed up with a lamb ragout pasta entree that I couldn't stop eating, much to my distended belly's dislike later that evening.  No room for dessert that night but I was more than sated, and so were my wife and our friends in Jackson.Service was friendly and the atmosphere casual but polished in terms of details.  Must try if you're in Jackson for sure."}, {"review_id": "o8hyr85DFc97UDSjLbTLgA", "user_id": "NqR8jT3PWDkTWBuZI-Vxyw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Ok, I know I shouldn't have had some of my daughter's chicken tenders....but I did. Best. The veggie sides, amazing. The brownie dessert with ice cream. Hold me back, just hold me back. Oh yes, the smaller dining area in the building to the left of the main dining room was key. Amazing:)"}, {"review_id": "B9YEykhDVLQFztkR1H-PDA", "user_id": "NTev0eZnBSCB5adHrObuzQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "I came here to have my dinner after the program in The Art Center of Mississippi. It's a nice restaurant in Jackson downtown. The ownership and chefs has been changed since last year. So, if you any pictures from last year, those foods may not be available now. Valet parking is available or you can park on the street. Average noise level. But the menu was a short one, not many options to choose from. Price is $$$. The oysters carina for appetizers were really great with perfectly seasoned.To make it right: add a drop of Tabasco and lime.  I am not impressed with the veal chop. I was expecting it to have more flavor and juicy. Love to have more varieties of fish. Hope it will get better with new management."}, {"review_id": "6a8P22hXAby-y6Hw-4G-Jw", "user_id": "0wzO086qRxBYSapHjZ2uvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I love sitting at the bar.

A very rare occasion where my husband likes each course, and this was the rare occasion! App Charcuterie with Cheese (sorry no pic, we dove in). They cure their own meats and cheese vary based ok fresh local grown, everything was delicious. Husband ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese. They make all of their own pasta! I tasted his dish, pasta was light and perfect and the bolognese was on point! Out of all I wanted to order, I ended up ordering their PM Parmesan Burger. I know a burger? Well not just any burger (note i did not get mine on a bun) on top of the perfectly cooked burger, fried mozzarella, fried eggplant, caramelized onions, small amount of tomato sauce and a basil aioli. It was delicious!! Husband had dessert, yes I had 1 spoon:) Raspberry, blueberry and blackberry cobbler with ice cream (sorry about pic, husband dove in before i could get pic how it was served) We will definitely be back here:)"}, {"review_id": "7BUVumG3AqOQWN0HpZPk_A", "user_id": "qMMUBzhArKwN34VxlAqwHQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "This spot is in a nice location downtown. They have a lot of unique items on their menu to choose from. I would recommend the burger or any of the steaks. Unique drink selection as well. the reason for only 3 *** is because it is a bit pricey for what you get. I believe I paid $10 for a drink and dinner was around $40. So, 3 drinks, dinner, + tip your looking @ $85. The atmosphere is excellent in this quaint joint and the service is ok - had to wait quite a bit for drinks. But it is worth a try or a good place to impress a date - but don't forget your wallet :)"}, {"review_id": "98n51RWLXxGLrlxpDPsbIw", "user_id": "SP4XVpxqikD0UIzJo6wYhw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "I went on a Tuesday at 6:30 PM so there was no wait. I sat at the bar and got my appetizer within 8 minutes (oysters Carina) and they were awesome. May be slightly spicy to someone sensitive to heat but I loved them.

Oh, and they hired a kickass bartender and let her loose on the liquor cabinet.This is officially now the best pasta restaurant in Jackson. The pasta is all made fresh daily by the new chef, Chaz Lindsay, who picked up a knack for pasta while living in Italy. The rest of the menu is what you might expect from the Derek Emerson family of restaurants - fish, steaks and big pork chops. When you go, make sure you take a chance on a cocktail you've never had. Kelly has brought some amazing ideas and new flavors to the bar and will not let you down."}, {"review_id": "ciIqYQtbF5aU4d9TtEbMlQ", "user_id": "Zw_bMaOcP778BNi8CIT1zA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2017", "text": "Literally perfection. I can't express my love for this restaurant enough. I feel transported every time. From the romantic ambiance to the charming staff, the delicious drinks and the amazing food! I had absolutely no complaints other than the fact that I didn't save room for dessert! We started off with the charcuterie and cheese. Which is hands down the best in the region. The variety of cured meats, pickled veggies and artisan cheeses will blow you away.I also ordered a wedge. Topped with pickled red onions, bacon lardons, blue cheese, cherry tomatoes, and candied pecans. PERFECT!I finished the night off with the pork chop. The best pork chop that I've ever eaten. Try a yellow bicycle! Parlor Market offers a changing menu, following fresh seasonal produce. I highly recommend it, you will not regret it!"}, {"review_id": "oUyWnwrrlB911gEiUqYMbQ", "user_id": "6ELSe9r0caJBV6xYYOHYsQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Event: Group of 50 dinner in old brick walled dining room.Pro: 1.

Inside the Parlor Market is decorated beautifully. The intimate atmosphere was made for a relaxed date night. The staff was very attentive -- from the moment we walked in with the host to the server and the busser. I didn't expect to find this gem downtown Jackson.Now, for food.... appetizers, we ordered the beef carpaccio and oysters rockefeller. No complaints about the beef carpaccio, it was great. Oyster Rockefeller came about half a dozen for $14. Toppings on the oysters were good, but on the salty side. For entrees, we ordered the Wagyu Culotte that came with a side salad. Meat was tender and cooked as requested, but fingerling potatoes were tossed inside the side salad. Combination of potato and salad didn't go well together. For the second entree, we ordered the very flavorful redfish. It was cooked with a little outside crisp, and served on top of a tasty broth. For sides, we the fingerling potatoes and risotto. Both were average. Ending with dessert, we had this Tiramisu. Overall experience was nice -- all given to the outstanding staff and nice atmosphere. Food was overhyped and on the pricey side especially for the area, but the restaurant had a great selection of drinks to choose from. Debating between a 3 or 4 star review, but given 4 for the service. Decor is pleasing to the eyes. Complimentary valet is offered."}, {"review_id": "CWDJrHI-qJf5SI-YpfYIWA", "user_id": "CTUWbIGQSGNz_-avM7D4zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/22/2018", "text": "Visiting this historic city and enjoyed a fabulous lunch of Niçoise salad with grilled tuna.

Located  on Capitol St it is a great addition in keeping the city's downtown area vibrant. The restaurant provides a very intimate atmosphere for it's guest.

Mixed food, drinks are average, and it may have been an off night, but service was SLOOOW. Took almost an hour to get our entrees, and almost 2 hours for the entire experience. The server also had a hard time clearing dishes off the table on a timely manner and keeping water glasses filled. The ambience was nice, and relaxed. Drinks were average. I've certainly had better at places like Manship or Bravo!, but they were adequate. Food, again, was a mixed bag. Some aspects were delicious, but there were some odd pickling choices with the pork cheeks small plate and the porkchop entree that were unnecessary. Porkchop was ordered medium-well, but came our dry and burnt on one side. To be fair, we probably could have sent it back and gotten the chop refired, but hesitated due to the long ticket time. Duck breast was great and was by far the best dish of the night. May try it again someday, but won't be in a rush. When you pay a certain level for dinner, you expect a certain level of service and attention to detail - and that's not what we received."}, {"review_id": "2KAbxe5KlzlT70Tr62xvUg", "user_id": "o7NWSEFd0TSeTzn8NT-liQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "Had the Red Fish!  Amazing!   Great service and they make a mean old fashioned!!   My coworkers had the pork chop and pasta and everyone enjoyed their dish."}, {"review_id": "cb2eqAVrAN4KPFzEOSAnMQ", "user_id": "KMCSUP2Onc6Cjziii2pmNA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/24/2017", "text": "I use to live downtown Jackson and Parlor Market was a place I enjoyed visting.
