But once in a rare while I find dish I am not a fan of, so I thought about giving it 4 stars. But I can't, the winning dishes are just so delicious. Their special dinners are when you can have some mind bending food. The best things I have had lately, the winter root bisque, Korean beef,  the Lamb ragu and last summer fresh strawberry bread pudding. Oh, and those raspberry crepes (I could like the plate clean)"}, {"review_id": "aMt3FqAJxCQJ3jsRJ7JCJA", "user_id": "AWQ9-dbx4w7gsAZ3k0rkZA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "This Is by far the best restaurant that I haven'tbeen to in my life and trust me I've been to almost them all at least in Chicago and surrounding areas., Wes Had an amazing time and the food was phenomenal as always.

The staff know their menu and how each food item is prepared. Everything I've had thus far has been delicious. Like I seriously scrape the plate I am a bit embarassed!Our most recent experience was for my birthday at the end of January. The duck nachos were amazing and the steak elotes! The bartender even offered me a complimentary cup of Moscato wine on him :)Their service is attentive, food is delicious, atmosphere is for all occasions, and an overall great experience.

Erin, my event manager, could not have been more helpful. I was doing the planning from a distance, with a time zone in between and Erin was very responsive.  The menu is tapas style, which I don't have a lot of experience in.  Erin stepped in and made suggestions.  She did such a fabulous job in choosing.  Everything was delicious! I ate things that I normally wouldn't try, and two days later, am still thinking about them!Rainbow trout with almond butter - who would have known I would love that so much?!We had a private room in the wine cellar, so every time we ordered from the bar, the staff had to take the stairs to retrieve our drinks - the food and everything else.  They got quite a workout! The service was excellent - we never wanted for a thing.I really wish we lived closer, Abreo's would be a favorite of mine to frequent!"}, {"review_id": "ZDcrrERAWdEDJk7U1QHF_A", "user_id": "k39vmETGp6X6Gi_mblPT6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/20/2017", "text": "This place is AMAZING!!!! The last time I was here was probably a couple years ago and since then they have remodeled and have expanded there dining room. I recently came here for the special Valentine's Day dinner with my friend. It was a special menu just for the night, you had your choice of a 3 course meal or a 5 course meal. We chose the course of course. Lol On a serious note, the 5  courses were AMAZING!  The service was great and the ambiance was perfect for the occasion. Our server was entertaining, very polite, had knowledge of all the courses, and recommended drink pairings with our meals. The timing of every course was perfect, we had new silverware everytime a new course was served. My favorite dish was probably the lobster risotto, it was just perfect. The lobster was tender and the risotto was a great consistency.  Overall, I would recommend this place over and over again."}, {"review_id": "CzLKQxZVHk5WFVK915YWmA", "user_id": "UGUxTZxZKOMZ2-HMRVqEQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/20/2017", "text": "The food was amazing.

Perhaps next time I go I will ask if they could have an easy hand on the salt. The reason why I gave this place five stars is not just for the food it's also for the service. We couldn't decide between the Korean beef or the steak and the waiter was nice enough to actually buy us the Korean beef. He was so nice and wanted us to have a great experience.

What a fabulous meal we had tonight! We were driving through Rockford on our way from Milwaukee to Davenport, and I looked at some reviews and picked this restaurant! My husband is a vegetarian who eats fish, and he ordered three courses. The seared tuna, the ravioli and the trout. Amazing. All three. The flavored were incredible. His favorite was the ravioli. I had the tasting menu. The chef planned an amazing meal tonight! It started with a delicious salad with breaded and fried Brie.  Next I had shrimp with cauliflower rice and bacon. It was amazing. Finally, I had a waygu beef cooked with a coffee rub with parsnips and carrots. The beef was a little fatty, but once I cut it off, it was yummy. For dessert we had the apple pie that had dates in it and was covered in a vanilla cream. Yum! It was out of this world! I only gave it 4 stars because our service wasn't fabulous. It was good, but the server for the next table was a little more attentive and engaged with his tables. He even came over and hung out with us a bit, too! Even though I'm not sure if we will ever be back to Rockford, I would totally come back here.

Latest visit was early Feb for an anniversary dinner. Had great service from the start to the end of the meal. The drinks were amazing. To start with we had the nachos which were delicious (and huge!). Due to the size of the nachos, my husband and I shared three plates- all amazing- Ramen dumplings, Steak elotes and chicken crepes- my husband wasn't a fan of the crepes, but i liked them. The elotes were the best of the three. Ambiance is intimate and perfect for date night.
