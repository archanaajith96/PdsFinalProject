The Lobster Roll was bursting to the brim with tasty meat that was lightly coated in a white dressing in the middle of a perfectly toasted buttered bun. The portion size is respectable mainly because of size of the lobster meat . I did not feel cheated in relation to the $27 price tag. The Shrimp Taco was very well done. The shrimp is lightly battered and coated with a honey garlic sauce. Its served with two grilled tortillas with guacamole in between. I had about five nice sized pieces of shrimp on my taco. I definitely felt that I got my moneys worth for $6. The food tasted amazing, looked stellar, and came out very fast. (-) Surprisingly Small As soon as I walked in I nearly ran into the customers eating at the bar area. Ten people could probably fit the length of that counter, maybe a few more. There is another smaller bar towards the \"far\" end of the restaurant that allows guests to watch as the chefs cook up the orders called in. This is were I sat with three other people. They chefs were very welcoming and pleasant to talk to. There are probably 3-4 tables in the restaurant also. That's it.  (-) Long Wait TimeThe restaurant is popular because its good but its also very tiny. This creates very long wait times. I went by my self and waited an hour to be seated. A group of 3 that showed up after me was seated pretty quickly though. They must save that tables for groups and the high chair areas from 1-2 parties.Conclusion: I only had two items from the menu but the food is worth the wait! I have confidence that any other item would taste just as awesome as the Lobster Roll and Shrimp Taco. Add 167 Raw to your places to visit when you come to Charleston."}, {"review_id": "lPDX_kTrL0N3DbG7-chllw", "user_id": "3HGFdkU6Uy6yXfS8HmzWJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Two main areas stand out about this restaurant -Atmosphere/decor: 167 Raw has a surf shop type of feel to it. Has about 20-25 seats total, with over half being bar seating. As a result, wait times may be long (me and my gf went Monday for lunch and waited about 35 minutes to be seated), but worth it! The intimate feel, bar seating, and finish of the ceiling, chairs, walls, etc enhance the experience.Food: we tried four oysters, the (halibut) ceviche, and lobster roll (posted). I believe the oysters and ceviche changes daily. Everything was spectacular, no complaints. The lobster roll was my favorite, it was perfect. The wait time for the food was minimal. Didn't order drinks but they serve wine and beer (no hard liquor). Service was great as well! Highly recommend going if you're a seafood fan."}, {"review_id": "86v0MfJFzBpHANPkDOwDiw", "user_id": "A3uJzozw9dryTNsuwZiwAQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "My son and I had lunch here and I can't say enough about how awesome it was!!

The space is small so you will wait. We came around 2ish and had about 20-30min wait outside before seats opened up. They do offer to bring you a drink while you wait, but you have to stay under the awning by the front door, which was already full so we sat on the bench on the sidewalk till our table was ready. It was sunny and beautiful out so we didn't mind the rest after walking most of the afternoon.When you walk in there's probably only seats for 10 at the tables then bar seating. We got 2 seats at the bar, which is our fave. Got to watch the shucking in action - the guy was a pro! I opted for a glass of rosé, Dan had a sauv blanc (which paired perfectly with the oysters). We went for a dozen oysters to share picking mostly the ones with the highest salinity from the board of options that day. Of the ones we tried, the Standish Shore (MA) and Pirate's Cove (MA) we my faves - briny and a good size, perfect with a spritz of lemon. I have to say, these were the best shucked oysters I've ever had! No grit, no shell bits, no extra digging to get the oyster out, and super fresh. We also decided to get some heartier eats - I had the shrimp po'boy and Dan had the fish tacos. The fish tacos were a heavenly experience for Dan. He said the flavor combos all made for the best bite, each bite with each garnish and dressing of the fish having purpose to enhance the flavor experience. Whatever they have on special, go for it. I have to say the shrimp po'boy offered the same vibe. Completely non-traditional with a sweeter beet sauce and a tangy herby green sauce, combined with the mega buttery grilled roll and lightly battered shrimp. I was impressed. A simple menu, but well crafted and excellent execution."}, {"review_id": "9M2VaMGmdvewuMWorHl2_w", "user_id": "MhlX4zIjst2erO_v72GRwg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Food was good and came out fast.

Yes, it is a little pricey, but it is WORTH IT!!! I have never had such good lobster rolls (and I've traveled quite a bit, and had my share of lobster rolls). The staff is super friendly, and it is fun sitting and watching the tiny kitchen make everything! YES it can get SUPER busy (but that means it is good, right? Especially since it is not in the heart of the hustle and bustle really).

It's a small place and you will sit close to other customers, but I don't mind it at all because I know what's coming! Friendly service from entry to exit and always willing to answer questions. I had none. I knew exactly what I was here for! 1/2 dozen three star medium oysters, a lobster roll and a glass of rose! Perfectly shucked, the oysters were succulent and salty/sweet. The mignonette and cocktail sauce aren't needed but make for an elevated flavor. Tip shell into mouth and they slid right in! They know how to properly shuck an oyster!That lobster roll, oh my, it's what dreams are made of! Warm, buttery and lightly crispy bread loaded with tender perfectly dressed lobster. My favorite sandwich of all time! It doesn't come cheap, and it shouldn't. It's a work of art! A glass of crisp rose with a slight citrus finish, a perfect marriage with seafood! I love this place! Yes, it can be hard to get into, but I think if they were three times the size, that would still be the case! The freaking best seafood in town!"}, {"review_id": "FenDvo4KjXv5VyKUQh8t8w", "user_id": "gx6Zk_A1labO_q1W3_IJzA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018", "text": "The food is fantastic! The only reason I'm not giving this restaurant five stars is because we felt rushed. It was our anniversary and we were enjoying our lunch and drink and decided on a lunch date so we wouldn't be rushed by our kids. However, that's what happened anyways. I understand them wanting to get us out because the venue is so small and people are waiting, but it is a restaurant and if we want to enjoy our anniversary and sit for a little while, we should have that luxury too without feeling rushed.

I have lived in Charleston for 2+years and 167 is the one spot I tell friends and family they can't miss. The theme of 167 is a Massachusetts style fish market where locals would come to purchase their fresh catch for the day. They have kept this tradition of only cooking fresh seafood which makes for a delicious meal.The place is tiny (seats 10-20 at a time) so you should arrive ~1 hour before your expected dining time. Although the wait is long, the service once you get in is quick, allowing them to serve many people and minimizing wait times. They have a full bar with daily beer and wine specials. I recommend trying to lobster roll, tuna burger, and the poke bowl when they have it."}, {"review_id": "aNz7cJLDjcgfDIeC4jqtkg", "user_id": "JScjU-vCBEArulbdoR-vFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "Absolutely fantastic! We had a craving for seafood on a quick day trip to Charleston and found the perfect place! We normally have our go-to restaurants when visiting the area, by decided to try something new and are so glad we did! First of all, the restaurant is quite small so be prepared for a wait. We were there for a later lunch on a Thursday and had a 40 wait before our table was ready. Thankfully the smells wafting through the front door and the ability to drink a beer on the front steps make the wait more bearable. The food was phenomenal. We started with the guacamole and and still fresh-from-the-fryer chips (amazing) and I had the shrimp taco and carnitas taco. Every element of the dish was perfection. I'm drooling just thinking about it. One of the best meals I've ever had while visiting SC.
