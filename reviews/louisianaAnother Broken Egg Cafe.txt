So what you're saying is, this place is so popular to the point that you have to wait a few minutes to eat and you then don't like it?? My point is, I don't really get the negative reviews for this place. The food is PRIME and our service was stellar. Perhaps they have a few bad waiters... I don't know, I haven't seen one yet. But I'd be shocked if someone could give me a reasonable argument that their food isn't awesome.Quick anecdote that relates, I promise: My first time in New Orleans, literally every single person I talked to said, \"oh, you MUST go to Cafe Du Monde to get their beignets!\" To which I obliged, and I agree, their beignets are pretty dang good. But to give you an idea of how much I like this place, if someone put Cafe Du Monde's beignets on a plate next to Another Broken Egg's biscuit beignets and forced me to choose, I would eat the latter every single time. Not kidding."}, {"review_id": "oxJck2-Ywoho_OCFyHDaMQ", "user_id": "su6eERXizKnmm8iAjMNn8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/17/2017", "text": "I would definitely recommend coming here for breakfast if you are visiting Shreveport! The food here was amazing! Props to the kitchen staff!!! The restaurant itself is also pretty neat inside as well! My overall rating is 4 stars because of the service (primarily sense of awareness and speed with the staff). Some other reviews of this place discuss the service not always being great. During my visit, while observing the staff, I could understand and experienced this. It should be noted that the staff was very friendly during the visit! FOOD was definitely 5 stars!! :)"}, {"review_id": "nnHosaR9CzvL4Tf1krUYkQ", "user_id": "rMK1IsaZP9fUKckXyFt2fA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "To me the poached eggs have a funny flavor.  As if they are poached and then held in warm water with something else so they will hold up.And there is no ramp close to the door for those who have a problem walking.And the place is so small that you end up standing and waiting for 15 to 30 minutes or more for a table.And finally the service sucks.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and asked for some worstershire to make it right.  Was told they had no bottles, just a vat of it at the bar.  So I asked if she could add some to my drink.  No, you will have to go get it yourself and carry your drink with you.  Had to walk through packed and jammed restaurant all the way across the place to the bar.   Never went back!  There are better places for breakfast and brunch that have good service and a place to sit and wait if need be and are easier to get into."}, {"review_id": "OIxt9MmY7xPTTShzn2tNyQ", "user_id": "_cyu3-J0NJ1BaXmOthcIMw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Nothing better than a scalding hot breakfast with tasty Bloody Mary's.

We used the digital check in, were seated within minutes and had the most delicious brunch. I loved the lobster omelette, and my husband devoured his crab cake Benedict (the sausage really makes this dish). Since it's my birthday, i splurged a bit with the lemon blueberry goat cheese pancakes, and I would do that again. I don't like anything overly sweet, and these weren't. Yet the goat cheese wasn't over powering, just a perfect compliment to the lemon and blueberry."}, {"review_id": "4JCHJlNYy_Nl_0zPWfhgzQ", "user_id": "fkE8bjLL-fxYj-1_rlq28w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "First time here, my client suggested we come here.

Its pretty modern ( i am visiting out of california so alot of places in shreveport look a bit outdated). I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place. My server recommended the shrimp n' grits for breakfast. Ive never had it before so i thought id give it a try. It was pretty good! The french bread was super good and i had to ask for more.

There was a wait when we arrived so we sat at the bar which was a great decision. Our waitress was super friendly and very attentive. Our coffees were never empty! For our meals we had crab cake eggs Benedict, salmon eggs Benedict, and we ordered one lemon blueberry goat cheese pancake (we were intrigued by the combination of ingredients and had to try it). Safe to say everything was delicious. Our only complaint would be that the poached eggs were a bit over cooked for us. We prefer our eggs to be runny. We will make sure to specify next time. Besides that, it was a perfect breakfast experience. 10/10 would recommend!"}, {"review_id": "zU8wZmRD0ZjD1FLXhfofhg", "user_id": "H0c8ynQCT_PwPe6u1LcYng", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "This is my favorite place for breakfast.

There's only a short wait on a Sunday afternoon,  which leads me to assume it's good but not great food OR it's expensive OR in a mediocre location. If I only chose restaurants that way,  I would have been incorrect.It's tasty, and I just think it's not as busy because people don't want to leave the house in the middle of the summer.  Its not overpriced, there are interesting options, and its good.Examples of menu items: Apple Pie Mimosas, Huevos Rancheros with Chorizo, Shrimp & Grits. Who doesn't like variety?Pros:- outdoor patio- tons of tables- full bar- brunch- many options for food- inviting decor- They are on the Waitr app- generous portionsCons:- staff was super busy, which makes it harder to be friendly or bubbly (as i look around I don't see any smiles except on one of the bussboys)They have their mission statement hanging on their wall for customers to see. That's a business that knows who they are, and what they offer, and why they do so much business.
