I've also had a gift card for here burning a hole in my pocket since Christmas, so it was the perfect time to put it to use. Our server Josh was friendly and professional and checked in with us often. Our nacho appetizer came out nice and quick. The chicken was juicy and not too spicy like I thought it might be.My turkey club was well made but it didn't have the third middle layer of bread I'm used to having in a club sandwich. The fries were crisp and plentiful and I actually finished them all which I rarely do at restaurants. My boyfriend had the 4 cheese mushroom and spinach pizza and really loved it. I definitely recommend dipping the crust in the olive oil dipping sauce they give you with your bread."}, {"review_id": "WrWG8zdNT1HDU3u63cDgPQ", "user_id": "y3jQvYJPsRtNJDuciBRtxQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "For a chain restaurant, NYAJ's is pretty good, but for a general restaurant I found it pretty average. Walking in, I enjoyed the light and inviting décor. You would think it's like your typical Applebees chain, but the vibe I got was one of a contemporary diner. For the food, I found it be overall underwhelming and under-seasoned. The bread rolls (more like a Focaccia) with the olive oil mixture was appetizing and helped to awaken the appetite, but everything after was the disappointing part. Recommended by the waiter, we decided to order the flatbread and Sirloin Tips.Flatbread: Layered with a balsamic-like sauce and sweet potatoes, the flavors didn't really pop. The center pieces had an appropriate amount of toppings, but as you get toward the crust it's just dough.Sirloin Tips: I was really excited to try this, but probably found this the most disappointing. The tips were completely charred and the only taste I could feel was burnt coal. Green beans felt like they were fresh, but were a little too raw to my liking. For steak, mashed potatoes, and green beans I didn't find anything special.Maybe I ordered the wrong dishes, but it's conveniently close to the Warwick Mall."}, {"review_id": "IK2lKw0Wwm9_qCdAbrQ0FQ", "user_id": "6qb7kMeZtB0giUCrDiEBLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/17/2018", "text": "Super food, excellent service, enjoyable meal.  After reading some positive reviews and a negative one I decided to stop in and try not your average Joe to see what was not so average.  I have to say that it was one of the most enjoyable meals I've had in a while. The food was flavorful and interesting in presentation, and fresh. The restaurant was bright and roomy which made it welcoming. The service was very good and the attention to customer satisfaction exceeded the norm at many restaurants these days. I look forward to stopping it again soon. I was intrigued by the crab cakes and started with that as an appetizer. The two crabcakes were nicely crispy on the outside with bountiful crab inside. It came with a light citrus remoulade and a side of Arugula that was surprisingly tasty in a bite with the crab. A side salad came with a tangy buttermilk horseradish dressing that had a nice flavor balance, not overly spicy or hot. Crisp and soft focaccia came gratis with a wonderful blend of cheese, oil and pepper flakes. I Couldn't get enough but resisted seconds. The dip was not overly spiced for my wife who isn't a spice fan, but spicy enough for me who is. The first entree started with a nice sized portion of salmon that was pan seared with a medium char with just salt and pepper but it had such a wonderful flavor, probably from the oil. It was topped with a sage pecan pesto sauce with a side of green beans instead of the normal Brussel sprouts and a slightly spicy mashed sweet potato that was a nice complement to the salmon. The second Entre was sirloin tips with green beans and rosemary carrots. I must say that the carrots were some of the best I've ever had and I would probably order them even though I normally would not. The steak tips had a Montreal type steak seasoning to them and were cooked well to a medium temperature.  When cut across the grain the texture was cut but any other cut was a little chewy. As good as the food was the service was even better. Everyone that came to the table was attentive to our needs, respond quickly with whatever we needed, and went over the top to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. They provided an appreciated service even when not requested. It's a wonderful treat in a restaurant today. Once again an enjoyable time I look forward to repeating."}, {"review_id": "dwMqn1REtxqqySOVr0IGAA", "user_id": "xI-GATCdUiQgg0g3EBKODQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/17/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I pretty much go here for the bread and oil soooooo good, I had the seafood fettuccine pretty bland wouldn't get it again, my daughter had the pizza also blah drinks are always on point but probably won't venture here often as there are so many other  great Update: went back after manager contacted me about my bland experience, have to say huge improvement got the steak tips, delicious!

We were pleasantly surprised by the modern contemporary style decor that made you feel you were not at a chain. It had the feel of a nice local bistro rather than a commercial chain.Wife and I ordered appetizers (egg rolls), which we should not have done for lunch. They were absolutely amazing, but bread comes out to the table. Usually I skip bread to finish my meal, but it was great. The dipping sauce was a oil olive/cheese/red pepper mix that was addicting.The cheese steak egg rolls were pretty good, if I come back, I'll just order these for my lunch. They were cheesy, packed with meat and good.The blue cheese burger I ordered came out perfectly medium rare and I enjoyed the burger, nothing really revolutionary about it. However, they did put fresh sliced jalapeños on it for me which isn't listed. That was a nice touch and the waitress and staff are super friendly. Wife liked her steak tips.All in all, if you are looking for something in vicinity of malls and other shopping areas without mom and pop's but want something more than a Chili's, go here. The people are nice, friendly, they have a seasonal menu."}, {"review_id": "A2kGL_jKXY26e1dTqYK8oA", "user_id": "xMdtG87CfQuF785pK275lw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Yum!

I returned to the location due to this, and had a great visit! Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. I ordered my go to dish, the chicken piccata, and my SO ordered the mustard crusted chicken BLT (or something like that). Both were great and came out very promptly for a busy Friday night. I also got a pomegranate martini, which was wonderful and fairly priced. Also, I can't say this enough: USE. THEIR. APP. On top of rewards, the reservations are a game changer. Why wait upwards of 40 minutes on a busy night when you can just log in and make a reservation? I did it literally from the parking lot of the restaurant, and they will always honor the reservation. Ended up being seated, eating, and paying before people that had been there before us were even seated.

We were kindly compensated for our meal with a $60 gift card along with a personal handwritten message, which was a nice gesture. So, back to the food! This time, we decided to order take out from NYAJ for fear of having to tip in case we had the same bad experience. We ordered miso salmon with bok choy and coconut risotto, heritage bone-in pork chop atop arugula and roasted potatoes, Thai chicken lettuce wraps, and a bowl of tomato basil soup. The meal came with their house bread and butter/olive oil? cheese dip.My son enjoyed his miso salmon -- I had a few bites to try and I did like it. It wasn't dry and had good flavor. Also enjoyed the coconut risotto. I didn't care for my pork chop that I ordered medium, since it will continue to cook in the heat...and it came out extra dry. I didn't mind the dressing on the arugula and the potatoes were good. I didn't try my bf's Thai lettuce wrap b/c he didn't like it and it didn't look appetizing. I give this 2nd chance 3 stars since I enjoyed some of the food. I'm very grateful for the business reaching out and asking for another try. However, I probably won't eat there again because nothing \"wowed\" us. BUT! at least some people I know enjoy eating here. Thanks again, for the reimbursement! Additional pictures posted.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I've never thought of coming here. I see it all the time and hear people say it's good, etc. I only gave it a try b/c my son wanted to try it out and I finally gave in. Well, it was just, Ok. The physical restaurant itself is huge, beautiful inside with high ceilings...many tables. However, we waited about five or more minutes for a table and they weren't busy at all. No one before us, no one after us. Two hosts were trying to figure out where to seat us. When they were finally ready, one host said to the other, \"did you ask if they wanted outdoor seating?\" The host nodded her head...but she did not ask us and I always choose to sit outside, oh well. Didn't want to bother them. Our server took forever to come and greet us and asked the initial, \"would you like anything to drink?\" Then she disappeared for a while after that as well. Going to make this short and not so sweet...the service was disappointing and the customer service from the server herself wasn't friendly at all. It seemed like she didn't want to be there at all and hated her job. I think it took about thirty minutes or more for our food to come out and the food was just, Ok, too. I ordered a caprese salad and had to ask for extra dressing b/c it was so dry. My son ordered steak tips that he did not enjoy b/c they were chewy. He asked for medium rare and they came out medium well. My bf ordered a meatloaf dish that didn't have enough gravy and when he asked for a side of gravy, the server said they didn't have any. It IS the average Joe's."}, {"review_id": "kDeEotGv7ixwVPC9W4rePg", "user_id": "twt2cniWvC-VYU_Jn1QcxA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/2/2017", "text": "For a chain restaurant in an area saturated of other chain restaurants I would highly recommend this place. I would highly recommend making a reservation because that made our seating experience in less than no time. The service was good not great. But I would say it is a little bit on the  pricier side of the spectrum. My husband and I ordered the pumpkin apple soup to start which was yummy and definitely gave me all of the fall feels. For entrees I has the steak tips which were well marinated, and the garlic mashed potatoes were definitely garlicky. The green beans could have been cooked better and maybe had all of their stems taken off. My husband ordered the Mona Lisa salad with crispy chicken, balsamic dressing, mozzarella amongst other things. He let me have a bite and it was quite tasty!

We got to Warwick a bit early so we hung out in our car for about 20 minutes before they opened but walked in as soon the clock hit 11:00. We were promptly greeted, seated, and handed menus. The decor inside was nicer than I thought (for some reason, I was imagining the inside of a Twin Peaks or something). Our server came along and got our drink and an appetizer started for us (cheesesteak egg rolls); the lemonade I ordered was more sour than I thought but I prefer that than it drowning in sugar. We didn't know that they served bread at this place so we happily ate the bread that came with a Parmesan cheese with butter and red pepper. Our egg rolls came in not long after and were pleasantly surprised how tasty (and very cheesy) they were! The bit of mustard it came with was good but wished it was a tad more on the spicy side. I ordered the sirloin tips with mashed potatoes and green beans while my husband got a blue cheese burger. My tips were cooked a perfect medium and the seasoning was decent. The mashed potatoes were okay but really could taste anything; the green beans were fresh and blanched just enough to be cooked through while having a bit of a crunch to them. My husband enjoyed his burger; it was cooked medium-rare with lots of fresh looking ingredients served on what looked like a brioche bun that looked tasty! I managed to finish the tips, green beans, and a few bites of the potatoes before I got super full; we made a mental note not to get an appetizer next time because that bread was good! Food was good overall, no complaints on the service...we'd definitely come back if we're in the area again and undecided on where to eat."}, {"review_id": "8YXU8wfE4eNBCjXnk4xg9w", "user_id": "Im5Q5c1c0_C2Smd3UQNuHA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I loveeee Not Your Average Joe's.

My steak tips were cooked well when I asked them to be medium rare and my mashed potatoes were almost hard. My friends pasta dish was almost cold as well. I was very disappointed in this visit and I hope this is turned around because I love NYAJ! Update: after posing this, I received a message and a gift card in the mail for my meal. We used the gift card tonight and all was right with the world! I was craving a grilled cheese and tomato soup and while the grilled cheese was technically on the kids menu, I still got a decent portion. My fiancé got a custom meal as well and we were both very happy. Our waitress Kayla knew the beers on tap and was very attentive.

So far I've had their:JAMBALAYA-which has andouille sausage, tasso ham, mello's spicy linguica, pulled chicken, shrimp, veggies and rice, simmered in a cajun-spiced tomato broth for $17.99.AndBBQ MEATLOAF- which has grilled meatloaf made with beef, pork, smoked mozzarella, veggies and herbs, with a tangy bbq gravy, mashed potatoes and herb-roasted carrots for $15.99.These two are my favorites.

They were very flavorful, but pretty much empty. Two tortillas, nice sauce, zero filling. So why am I giving Joes such a stellar review if I didn't like the tacos? Simple, the waitress (Ashley I believe) noticed we were not exactly impressed. I'm not a complainer, so we didn't really say anything we just ate our salad (the Mona Lisa, it's really good!). Ashley asked us what we thought of the tacos as they are still testing them out on the menu I think she saw we were not happy. We told her the flavor was good, but the tacos were pretty much empty.
