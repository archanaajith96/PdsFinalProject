One of the best seafood restaurants in ATL. We had a large party of 10, and had to change our reservation multiple times. They were so accommodating!They have a great outdoor area that opens in the spring, and a fast valet system. We were seated immediately, and I started with the Oceanside cocktail. It was delicious! Everyone raved about the cocktails they ordered. We started with raw oysters, the shrimp appetizer, swordfish crudo, steak tartare, calamari, and fried oysters. They were all delectable. My favorites were the crudo and calamari. The shrimp dish was also delicious, but very spicy!For my entree I ordered the lobster roll. It's SO good. I've ordered this in the past, but they now serve it with housemade BBQ chips. Others at the table ordered the mahi mahi special served with crispy prosciutto in a butter sauce, and the striped bass served with mussels. For dessert we ordered the blueberry pudding cake (somewhat like bread pudding), and that, too, was great. Overall it was a great experience and wonderful place to celebrate a birthday. It's beautifully decorated, and great for large groups. I highly recommend it!"}, {"review_id": "KSYoJE_Ghd_UlNZ5iqZk_g", "user_id": "GcRReISCooKwajFzqlFY0Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "FOR SEAFOOD LOVERS, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!The location is quiet and on the outskirts of the city in west midtown rather then right in the middle of all the crazy traffic. The surrounding area was quite beautiful. There are lofts here so it is a residential are connected. Pro Tip: The reservation times get booked very quickly, so if you're planning on eating at the Optimist, reserve or call as early as possible to schedule a reservation. Otherwise you may just miss out! They were packed even on a sunday late dinner!Parking is easy as they have a valet for only $3. Which is not bad at all! Plus, you can have the $3 added to your bill before you pay and just have the receipt to the people outside after they get your car.They serve complimentary freshly baked dinner rolls with oil and butter. Mind blown! BEST OYSTERS! BEST OCTOPUS! BEST SHRIMP! GREAT SCALLOPS!My first oyster experience would be at this restaurant, and honestly I'm still thinking what I was missing out in life! We had the Deep Cove, Beach Plum, Hollywood and Va Va Voom (2 of each kind). For entrees we ordered crispy octopus and shrimp a la plancha which are both starters (Trying to get the best of the best all in one sitting at this restaurant!) and also had their scallops. BEST COMBO to try for sure, couldn't have gotten better that!HAPPY HOUR! They have $1 oysters during happy hour M-F 5pm-6pm and Sat-Sun 3pm-5pm. I am definitely going back because their oysters are to die for!!!!

When it comes to happy hour deals, oysters are arguably one of the best things you can get - if done right. Oysters are generally more expensive than most other food options, but if you can get solid oysters for a dollar each, it's hard to beat. If good oysters for cheap sounds good to you, you should hit up The Optimist's happy hour. What's unique about the happy hour here is that they have every single day of the week, even Saturday and Sunday:- Mon to Fri from 5-6 pm- Sat and Sun from 3-5 pmNot too many places can say that. As far as getting here, if you don't Uber, Lyft, etc. here, you can always park along the side streets or use the valet.If you want the happy hour option, you do have to sit at the oyster bar area or the patio. Either option seems great since The Optimist has a great atmosphere throughout. You do have several options for dollar oysters:- Damariscotta River (MA)- Wash Ashore (MA)- Barnstable (MD)- Terrapin Creek (MD)If you want a variety, you can always go for the Baker's dozen and get 13 for the price of 12. They come with house made saltines, which is a really nice touch, as well as cocktail sauce, hot sauce, mignonette, and grated horseradish. Even sitting at the bar, the service is really good - attentive, but not over bearing, and you'll get your oysters pretty quick.Overall, it's a great experience and one worth trying."}, {"review_id": "hwkRFi_HIjl7ggUgRGGO6w", "user_id": "ouSn08OZTF7JVl9dNoyTgQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "A great variety of seafood and a daily changing menu. This spot is definitely on the pricey side so be prepared to spend. Our waiter was great and knew her menu well. She was able to give us intricate details about the notes of wine.

I had heard from a couple of people that it was their favorite restaurant when they felt like spending money on good food. Needless to say, I was excited to try it. I made a reservation on Open table,  and indicated that it was a birthday celebration. I was pleasantly surprised to be given a menu with happy birthday stamped on it. Also, the hostess and our server also knew it was my birthday. Note about valet: it's only $3, but they'll likely give you a speech about how they don't see any of that and live off tips. In that area, unfortunately, it's hard to find street parking that is convenient. So like a lot of places in Atlanta, the valet is required (albeit not necessary since it is a parking garage). Once seated, we looked oved the menu. Their entrees are a la carte, so the meal can add up pretty quickly when you have to pay for sides separately. I ordered the monkfish with a side of grits. I enjoyed every bite of my dish. Along with the romesco, it was flavorful and flaky, cooked perfectly. The grits had cheese (yay!), were flavorful, and silky smooth just how I like them. My friends ordered mussels and scallops, and really enjoyed those, too. There was enough on the menu that if you're excited about seafood, you'll have enough tasty-sounding options from which to choose. We also ordered drinks. I opted for a Manhattan, my favorite drink.  It was well-made and very strong. I also asked for 3 of my favorite \"special\" cherries because you can't just get one, lol. In recognition of my birthday, they brought out a plate with a candle. I am a minimalist, but this is something I have never seen before. Before I could make a wish, it went out on it's own! I appreciated the intent, but can say without hesitation, that something else on that plate (i.e. food) would have been welcomed.Overall, it was a great experience. Service, food, and ambience all worked together. I would definitely return. This was my first time, so I can't give it 5 stars until I know that they're consistent and other things on the menu are equally as delicious. But the potential is there."}, {"review_id": "kCr37TFbRSkUtlFHYNBE2A", "user_id": "xklBwEVkrNBo6IPZ-Etw8A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Love the happy hour and the house punch.. very nice place!

JUST WOW. My husband and I revisited The Optimist last night for dinner. The last time we visited they had a bit of an off night, but that certainly was not the case last night. It was five star all the way! The experience began with our FABULOUS server Meka. If she's working, ask for her. She selected our entire meal, with cocktail and wine pairings and was 100% SPOT ON. Everything she selected for us to enjoy was perfect. She is gracious and kind, and most of all very attentive to her customers. She is amazing. We began with fresh oysters. They were plump,  juicy and delicious and not a single bit of grit to be found. Our favorites were the creamy, briny Sweet Petit and the bright Purple Mountain. Next we enjoyed two selections from the crudo menu. The Grouper crudo has a spectacular presentation with a fresh, sweet and sour flavor, while the salmon crudo has a wonderful spicy flavor compliments of a hint of chili puree. It was hard to choose our favorite, but you just can't beat the salmon. The spice was perfect. My husband spotted the smoked fish chowder so we sampled that next. It did NOT disappoint. SO DELICIOUS with HUGE chunks of fish, bacon and a wonderful smoked flavor. It was served with oysters crackers that were the perfect accent to the chowder. Next came roasted golden beets in buttermilk with sunflower seeds and chili. I am such a huge fan of beets and these were absolutely divine. The buttermilk added a really nice tang. Our next dish was the Crispy Spanish Octopus. This was my favorite dish of the evening. It was perfectly cooked, meaty and tender with zero chewiness. It's served with a spicy honey that will completely knock your socks off! Excellent. For our entrees we enjoyed the Grouper and the Halibut. Again, two stellar choices. Both fish were perfectly prepared and simply delicious. The sides served were the Butternut squash with burnt honey, the Brussels with bacon agrodolce and the basmati fried rice with peanuts, smoked fish, tomato and egg. I truly believe we could have made a complete meal with the sides alone. Do yourself a favor and make certain you try the squash and the fried rice. You won't find anything like it anywhere else. Along with sampling two beautifully mixed craft cocktails from the menu, we also had the pleasure of trying the new Romeo and Juliet cocktail not yet on the menu. Try. This. Now. Ask the staff pretty please and I bet they'll make it happen! Our evening was a stellar experience. From the staff to the meal and everything in between, it was absolutely perfect. This is EXACTLY what we've come to expect from a Ford Fry restaurant....and THEN SOME."}, {"review_id": "4wphdqABoJoYJgmXsq2xCA", "user_id": "wvXOX-nV4EnkCQ9eKzvQ_A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "Happy Hour Oysters always make my day. It makes more of my day when there is Happy Hour Oysters on a Saturday (where else does that exist??)! The restaurant is beautiful! High ceilings, good-looking bar, cute individual restrooms.... this place was a charm. This place has a good amount of oysters on HH, but it doesn't beat my baby, Cull&Pistol (forever representing this Chelsea charm). The oysters were shucked beautifully here, I must say. I was happy with my first round, but for the second round, I got a couple or regular priced oysters and HH ones, and they missed shucking an oyster for me. I'm glad that when we told the server, they got it for us. We also ordered some shrimp and calamari. The shrimp was okay, and the sauce that came with it was amazing! The calamari was good too, BUT they added sea salt flakes on top that just got way too salty for me. If they didn't have a heavy hand on the salt, I would have enjoyed it more. Service her was okay, but I think there was just a little confusion. I wasn't sure if they were all taking care of us, because some got great attention, while other guests didn't. I really wasn't bothered by it, though. Something that I wish they didn't do is give the dinner menu at 3pm, because I thought we could order from it, but wasn't available until 5pm. Oh well.

Naturally, that would entail trying one new restaurant per week on date night since we both love to eat! Therefore, a few weeks ago we decided to stop by here as we both were craving oysters on date night that particular week. We made a reservation on Open Table and off we went. Valet is on the side or you can self parallel park on the streets nearby. As you walk towards the entrance you will see their mini golf and outdoor waiting area. It wasn't used the night we visited and it's winter. Once we enter the front door you will see the hostess area on the right to confirm your table. On the left you will see the seafood station where the prepare the oysters and other shellfish. We had a reservation so we were promptly seated. I would suggest making a reservation as it was a full house the night we visited. The inside is nautical meets cosmopolitan feel. Felt like I was back in Miami a bit with the big open space and high ceilings while eating seafood.The menu is simple and easy to review. It seems like most people for dinner stuck to items offered and served on china but being my first time and to be macro friendly we ordered the \"the refuge\" plateaux for two plus a dozen extra oysters. People seem to slightly dress up for dinner here so that might be why. The wait for the food was short, but they still offered us some of the complimentary bread. In addition my husband drink was excellent. I was surprised. The plateaux consists of shrimp, lobster crab, ceviche, and oysters.I have to say the plateaux offerings were surprisingly fresh for Atlanta being land locked. However, the oysters of chefs choice were not my cup of tea (to muddy and grimy tasting). But the other dozen oysters we ordered that my husband and I personally picked were excellent. I highly recommend the oysters here. Our waiter advised they have happy hour oysters so we def will be back for that. Service was excellent and fun. It was around Christmas so the staff were dressed in Christmas sweaters and Christmas suits. Highly recommend for oysters."}, {"review_id": "61Jnwr1mJp_8XTv8PRXoqg", "user_id": "Ekw7wuUTX36BtcPP6XnA-Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/4/2018", "text": "This is a great place to eat.  Was visiting on business and had dinner with a colleague.   She suggested The Optimist and it was a great choice.  Food - we started with the mussels as an appetizer and they were really good.  Good flavor with a lot of broth.  For the main I had the yellow fin tuna.  The portion was a little small but still very good.  We also shared the Brussels sprouts as a side.  They were top notch.  Service - our service was great.  Our waitress was a former chef so she provided really good suggestions.  Atmosphere -   Good modern looking restaurant.  Open look to the seating and it was very comfortable.

Pro Tip: The reservation times are booked very quickly, so if you're planning on eating at the Optimist, call a day before to schedule a reservation. Otherwise you may just miss out!To start, I want to commend the host/hostess staff at The Optimist. Due to Uber issues, our party ended up being late. A friend called and notified the staff and The Optimist was more than understanding. We were still able to receive a table, even after walking in 45 minutes later than our scheduled dinner. We sat down to eat around 10:30 pm!We started off with a bottle of Malbec and raw oysters with all the fixings. I tried the oysters on their house-made saltines and took a few as a shot; the oysters were delicate and delicious both ways. We also enjoyed the octopus starter, which came coated in a spicy honey glaze, and melted in my mouth like pure butter. It was by far my favorite dish of the night- be sure to order it when visiting The Optimist.  Our mains included: Cobia, Halibut, and the Branzino--all three were prepared exquisitely and just so, so fresh tasting.
