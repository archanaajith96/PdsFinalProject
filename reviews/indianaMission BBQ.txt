Cafeteria style dining, you order at the counter and sit down, staff is friendly. There are nice touches like 6 styles of BBQ sauce at the table and a roll of paper towel when things get messy. Food is always fresh and tastes great, the jalapeno sausage is the best I've had. Atmosphere needs to be worked on, it kind of makes you feel out of place, as if you're sitting in a highschool gym at an awards ceremony. Overall a good dining option if you're in the mood for good BBQ.Pro's+Food+ServiceCon's-Atmoshpere"}, {"review_id": "loxPZoAzPNtQXloW2LjZrA", "user_id": "LQSTOG6Auz9Ld0O7fDbMBA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "The ribs were pretty good.

We were on our way back to Chicago from Nashville and decided to take the scenic route (41). This is a bit of a distance from the highway but it's well worth the extra drive. My wife had the turkey. She said it was delicious. Super tender. She also liked the coleslaw. I had the pulled pork sandwich - North Carolina (NC) style - with coleslaw on top. That's the way to get it! I liked the Tupelo Honey Heat sauce the best (on this sandwich). The beans were pretty good as well. We live near Real Urban BBQ in Oakbrook IL. They could learn a lot from Mission on every level (layout, commitment, quality, price, etc.)."}, {"review_id": "gm476VT_K2V_szrBZKDAmg", "user_id": "cwaLG7qpKjRJWmJJQyDRXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "Excellent pulled pork, tater salad and baked beans.

Every single time I visit I leave sad, because I wish I could stay and eat so much more. Mission has the best set of employees of any chain restaurant in the region. The pork, Turkey, brisket, macaroni, fries, and desserts are a can't miss. The sauces on the tool box are outstanding, however, the ones on the table are mediocre. If you are looking for sauce, go for the Alabama White, Baja Bold, and the Georgia Mustard on the toolbox. Those three are by far the best. I love Mission, by far one of my favorite places to dine."}, {"review_id": "S2raMpP5D5QlQE_jFopH2Q", "user_id": "e-m2UZ_GC8tz9L-kRcrBjw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "While the employees were great, my experience was ruined by the food. I was forced to order the pulled chicken sandwich (as they were out of pulled pork) with macaroni and cheese and a blueberry cobbler. The sandwich arrived with undercooked chicken and a soggy bun, which is expected with barbecue, but not immediately upon arrival. The sauces provided on the table were all unsatisfying, though I have since learned that there are other, better sauce options near the utensils. The macaroni and cheese was decent, but it was the delicious blueberry cobbler and the employees that saved them from a one-star rating. The cashier must have heard me talking about the blueberry cobbler, because she gave it to us for free after we told her it was our first time. They sent me a gift card, so I will be reassessing my review upon my second visit."}, {"review_id": "RhaOt7Ul7ysj2zRK7vDzzQ", "user_id": "1JcgOEohUMLTZ6GJBuP8QA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "This is the best chain BBQ spot.

Would have preferred some crunch.Brisket and the cheese potatoes... were just as good as the first time I was there.  Service as always was excellent.Best bbq I have had in Evansville!"}, {"review_id": "YQWh2iYmV-se1ZjvinvXLA", "user_id": "7OxxfyD_osDaL3y4U03bfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "Even though it's not a \"sit down\" restaurant, you still get that feel.

The restaurant itself supports veterans which is also a plus.  This dining experience I chose the handmade fries (sprinkled them with old bay seasoning that's available.. because delicious), the pulled pork and the \"wet\" brisket. They have 6 available house made sauces, the Texas twang and smoky mountain are my two person favorites. Making it a full meal and adding a drink the massive amount of food only cost me about $15.
