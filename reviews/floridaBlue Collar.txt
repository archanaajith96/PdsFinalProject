The wine all the way to the mint chocolate was perfect in every way. I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and the reviews made me want to even more. I decided I would take my dad out for his birthday dinner and when I told him they served jambalaya, he was sold. I made a reservation cause thanks to handy dandy yelp, l read it was a tiny place and we were going to be about 5. Super quick phone call and they even called two hours before to confirm. Now when you get there it honestly doesn't look too great cause it's next to a closed down motel, I pretty much second guessed my decision, but I stuck through it and my oh my, did it not disappoint!We were immediately greeted at the front and sat and upon sitting were immediately introduced to our waitress and brought waters. To drink we chose a bottle from Spain from 2014 (the Funky then Fruity Tempranillo by Jorge Ordonez). And to eat we went straight for the jambalaya. The wine was smooth and like the name, funky then fruity. But oh my god I fell in love at first bite with the jambalaya. You know how it's really hard to find jambalaya outside of NOLA, well look no further, I FOUND IT. I might even say it's the best I've ever tasted (shhh, don't tell the folks in Nawlins ;)). To top it off, it comes in the biggest plate, but it was so good, I was ok with not sharing and finished it!To finish off, we got the butterscotch bread pudding with a spicy whipped cream. From the first bite, I think I went to heaven. It had the perfect combination of sweetness and lightness and the whipped cream was a great addition. It's not at all pudding, but more of a soft bread, but I wouldn't have it any other way! You feel a little kick with the whipped cream in your throat but it's the perfect amount and acts as a palate cleanser. Don't know what it is but I love it! When the bill came, I had no problem paying it cause I know my dad and I enjoyed it to the fullest. I will for sure be returning to try the different dishes and the brunch menu. Just a little side note cause I stumbled upon the owners little bio: FSU fans welcome, go noles!"}, {"review_id": "E9PSntz2ohGhQTzISGW0lw", "user_id": "8kPc3SclgNr_6WT3Fp7mNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I have this friend and she's always like, we have to go here, it's amazing, she was spot on!  This is one of those places you don't want to Yelp about and just keep to yourself because it's just that good! I'll start with their service and the spot. Their service is amazing, very attentive but not on overload. They have a cute little patio area and a rather small dining room, so I would say come with a smaller group and make this more intimate. If you're going on the weekends, make a reservation, otherwise plan to wait an hour or 2. Not a bad idea though as there's some cute spots in the area to grab a drink. This place is always busy is really what I am saying, rightfully so! I haven't tried their brunch, but I can speak to their dinner. I was there with a group of 4, which I'd recommend as a perfect sized crew for this spot. We all shared a bottle of wine, and I'd say they have a nice selection of wines and beers! We had the Cuban sandwich spring roll - first off how fun and unique, but overall delicious!! Next we had the buffalo chicken drumrolls, yeppp, I got my fingers dirty for this, delish! For our entrees we shared the jambalaya, their mango chicken special, and the vegetable dish which you choose four from an amazing large selection. We decided on the sweet potato mash, asparagus, Brussels sprouts and veggie fried rice. If I'm not back home in Iowa, this is EXACTLY the type of home cooked meal I want! I particularly enjoyed their jambalaya as it had a nice kick to it! We finished up with 2 desserts; key lime pie, and their chocolate chip cookies with milk . I couldn't put down the fork when I started eating those cookies, I was in heaven. I also liked the key lime pie, and I'm not a key lime fan but I would order their key lime pie for sure! Needless to say, I will be back and I can't wait to try many other options on their menu.

It's not a big place but very cozy. Went for lunch this time. Ordered the shrimp and grits and the gouda with mustard sauce. Both are a must order! For the entree I ordered the fish with vegetables fried rice and the roasted beets with goat cheese. Fish was fresh and well season. I love beets and I wasn't disappointed. I debated getting the mash potatoes and by recommendation of our waiter he said the vegetable fried rice was amazing. And he did not let me down. For dessert I had the health bar bread pudding with spicy whip cream. It was really good! Definitely a must got place!

They offer wine and beer, no hard liquor. I got the grilled chicken with peas, bacon, and shallots. The chicken was a tad dry, but nothing a little hot sauce couldn't fix.

As per tradition, there was an after party and the chosen location was Blue Collar. Me being a lame-o, well, I opted out, and I can definitely now say that I missed out. Nearly six months later, I finally made a visit to Blue Collar with my boyfriend and I now see what a mistake it was to not have gone to this restaurant months ago. We went on a Sunday evening after seeing my coworker's performance at the CCE. I believe it was around 7:30 PM or so when we arrived and service was prompt. We were sat outside as this place was packed. Despite this, our waiter was on top of us if you don't count the appetizer incident. See, we ordered an appetizer and he entirely forgot about it, but hey, he made up for it and we got a free dessert, so that completely negates this statement. Anyhow, I will get to that dessert later.For drinks, I ordered a pear cider and it was amazing. I'm very picky with drinks by the way, so this is saying something from me. Boyfriend ordered a beer and was pleased. Given that the appetizer we wanted was forgotten, we ended up stuffing ourselves with chicken parmesan. Yes, we both ordered chicken parmesan, but we had seen another woman who had ordered it and it just spoke to us. The chicken parmesan was probably one of the better ones I have had in my life admittedly.After stuffing ourselves with chicken parmesan, we were granted a free dessert. We had various choices, but we ultimately went with the chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was massive and came with a glass of milk. Biting into that delicacy was like coming home to freshly-made chocolate chip cookies. The flavor was heavenly, it felt comforting, and the cake was just so moist that it made the world go round. As you can tell, I fell in love with this place. I really want to return sometime for brunch, and heck, maybe I will even get a reservation. I have heard plenty of great things about the brunch, and if the brunch is anything like dinner, then I must go back soon."}, {"review_id": "ErDPGUEFiKyDtSsieTHg9g", "user_id": "uWxsbnjfmFRZ_GnsFETbdw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "On the way to another restaurant, decided to stop here instead and give it a try. Boy, I'm glad i did! The staff was very warm and genuine. We sat outside and enjoyed a nice ambience. The menu has a great selection but not overly vast. Our waiter was very attentive, knowledgeable of the menu and helpful. I ordered the artichoke Benedict and my oh my was it good! The lemon aioli drizzled on top gave it a nice, light and refreshing note but it was still full of flavor. Served on top of ciabatta bread, that was toasted to the perfect amount giving it a crispy outside and a soft center. A nice crowd comes out here, and i see why.

I've heard rave reviews, and it definitely lived up to the hype.Located in a motel, the space serves up a kitschy diner vibe with a nouveau Americana menu. It's got an open kitchen (which proved to be somewhat stifling on a summer night) and friendly service. I ordered the crispy chicken with sweet potato plantain mash and caramelized brussel sprouts. I've heard great great things about their veggie sides, so I chose an entree where you could try out two. While the brussel sprouts left much to be desired (under-salted, kinda tasteless), the mash was absolutely spec-ta-cu-lar. It offered a soft and sweet complement to the crispy chicken, which was crunchy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. Would definitely recommend the mash for sure!As for the other diners I was with, here are some insights I picked up: the ribs (and the sauce that came with them) were tender and flavorful, the pork cheek practically melts in your mouth, the steak was somewhat underwhelming, and the veal parm got two thumbs up. Get ready to get stuffed, take home leftovers, or share with a friend, because portions are enormous and well-worth the price.Warning: This is a teeny spot and there's little space for waiting parties, so make a reservation! Especially way in advance if you're looking to come out for brunch. The largest party that can be seated is probably a group of eight. There's also limited parking off to the side of the motel its located in, but plenty street parking if you keep an eye out!"}, {"review_id": "GFX_ZhqHGqpeanPYapgW3A", "user_id": "M7cAuMtvt4zbwP7o_Wvi2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Great Spot!The chalk board of veggies was amazing!The Vaca Frita tostones app was awesome, so was the smoked Gouda.The Veggie plate was amazing.

Great Yelp reviews 2. Featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives 3. Guilty Pleasures. So when I had the opportunity to pick I chose this place as well as I had reservations for lunch on open table. It is season now in South Florida so you never know. When we arrived I was surprised as it seemed to be a part of the hotel at least in front of it anyway. So once inside I double checked to make sure where we parked was ok and thankfully it was at the hotel which is adjacent to this restaurant. Once inside not as large as I imagined but perfectly fine for our group. I positioned my self so I could see the specials in the chalkboard as well as the kitchen. We ordered our drinks and service was excellent I had a Perrier. For the main course I ordered the duck quesadilla that comes with a fig jam and Mixed green salad. My lunch companions had the large ragout sandwich with fries. You could tell they were homemade so I snuck one. Food was delicious  it was great to have a home made meal. The decor was very retro with lunch boxes on the walls. If you order coffee you get the thermos. As for dessert we shared the chocolate cake that came with whole milk in an old fashioned milk bottle on the plate. When leaving I noticed the old time cards on the wall keeping with the theme of this lovely restaurant."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-collar-miami?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
