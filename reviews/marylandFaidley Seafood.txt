I had the salmon cake - AMAZING! totally fresh and flavorful. We also had the deviled eggs - OMG deliciousness. Good selection of beers too. But: if you are like us, out of town - catch a cab. Somewhat scary walk through the city to get here. We can't wait to come back.

They were featured on the  Food Network and we were anxious to try the infamous crab cake. So when you come in its like a giant seafood market, we almost walked past the spot theres like four restaurants in the same area. You could tell we were not from Baltimore lol. So we get in line place our order she ordered the crab cake with two sides mac n cheese and french fries with a sweet tea. I ordered the steamed shrimp with french fries and mix veggies and also a sweet tea. When your in like its like a lunch line. You place your order and the girl yells your order to the person behind her, writes something on your tray and tells you to walk on down where you pay and pick up your sweet tea. You then have to find your own spot to wait until your meal is called. They have tables but no chairs so yes you are standing when you eat, I wasn't a big fan of this at all. So once your food is done they call you back over and place it on the tray for you. Now to the food part, the crab cake was okay, it didn't have the usual strong crab taste I have had with other crab cakes, which I did like. The vegetables were good they were tossed in some kind of sauce I didn't ask. The french fries were french fries lol nothing fancy. The shrimp were very tiny with no flavor. The mac n cheese I didn't try but my cousin said it was ok just average. Now to this sweet tea!!! It was delicious, I mean to be honest the damn sweet tea was the best part of the meal!!!  I wouldn't recommend anyone travel to come try the crab  cake you could get a better one at the local seafood spot in Philly. I wouldn't go back either."}, {"review_id": "csqxU4Pc2ikuhdsmu5hwfg", "user_id": "cM18DJYdmxjqj3zc97Huxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "Delicious crabcakes!!!!

Anyway, staff is very nice and they definitely got their system down pat. We got the lump crabcake and the backfin crabcake. Backfin was good but the lump was amazing!!!

After hearing about this place a bunch I just had to see what all the fuss was about. I ordered the jumbo lump crab cake platter with collard greens and mac & cheese as sides.

I can see why this place is famous; they are not kidding when it comes to crab! I was a bit skeptical at first - $14.95 for one jumbo lump crab cake is pretty pricey but when I bit into it, I could see why: there are HUGE lumps of crab in there! Crab that is sweet, juicy, fresh. My goodness, it was fantastic. I also loved how it was seasoned and for a fist-sized portion, I was full by the end of it. Also tried their clam chowder, which was okay but not worth getting to be honest. Needed a tad bit more seasoning and it came slightly cold, which was a bummer. Atmosphere wise, this place has no chairs -- just tables to stand around while you eat your food. All-in-all, definitely worth a visit if ever you're in Baltimore!"}, {"review_id": "Xu4fbJ96sz0qHZnY_aRKFQ", "user_id": "zVqfBNUS9cTyZZicbzKdqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "Probably one of the best crab cakes I've ever had!

Eat crab cakes! You ask anybody what Charm City is known for and it's their delicious crab cakes. No look further than Faidley's! It's located inside the Lexington market and you must come here if you're in town.There are a bunch of different counters you can order from and each counter offers something a little different. One counter is whole crabs. Another is designated for oysters. The most popular counter is the crab cake one. The crab cakes here are what you expect: real crab...nothing else. The crab cakes are huge baseball-sized monstrosities. You can taste the freshness with each bite and they're so good that you don't even need any sauce. I would recommend the platter so you can choose a few sides to accompany your crab cake. We also ordered gumbo and a few oysters and they were pretty good too! The gumbo had a ton of seafood and sausage inside. The oysters were shucked right in front of you and were delicious. The lady at the oyster bar was so sweet. She made sure we had a great experience since it was our first time.Looking for a place to grab crab cakes in Baltimore? Go to Faidley's!"}, {"review_id": "5gfHJD1QcuWm5HJfeOqbkw", "user_id": "q4sbRMAS69Aq7_eWv_nc1w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Probably the best crab cake in baltimore!

The Crab Cake Lump is a no-frills, golfball-sized hunk of crab at an affordable price. Good on its own, no sauce or condiments are needed to enjoy. It's light, it's generously large, and each bite is a bountiful morsel of crab. Located inside the Lexington Market, it's kinda hard to find.

It was huge, golden brown, seasoned extremely well and filled with delicious sweet lump crab meat.  I'm wondering if they chose the #1 (male) crabs from the Gulf Coast of Louisiana. I always get my dozen of #1's from Westwego Seafood Market and when they're fat,  they're great.  The line was pretty long but it goes so fast you really wouldn't have realized the wait while taking in all that's there to see. There are no chairs and tables, only bars and stools and people stand up eating from the hot bar or oyster bar.  People are everywhere in there and it has a sports bar like feel.  The order takers are nice, efficient and LOUD, just in case you didn't hear, \"NEXT.\"  I paid $15.95 for one jumbo lump but I'll say it is worth it. In one of my pictures of the crab cake, the front ones were the smaller crab cakes and the ones in the back are the jumbos. They also have side dishes like mac n cheese, greens, fries and onion rings. A pic of the menu is attached. I liked it as a first timer because we walked into the other food court areas and did more shopping.
