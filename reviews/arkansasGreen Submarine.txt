A black hair that was longer than the foot long sub itself.  At about the time I found the hair, the guy who served me the sub came by to drop off some bbq sauce.  I told him about it and his response was\"Oh, sorry about that!\" And off he went.  I assumed to make me a new sandwich.  About six - eight minutes later he comes back and asks if I am going to eat the sub or if I want him to make me another.   As I assumed they were already making my new sandwich, I thought about it for a second then decided to tell him not to bother, as I really could not be sure what they would do if they had to go to the bother of making me a new sub!"}, {"review_id": "teuy-si0muGjUrvgs8PUVw", "user_id": "fVwK5xhFuCLPnZs4cczLXA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "If you're looking for the perfect fill up, look no further. My go-to place for all things sandwhich. Forget the days of nasty $5 footlongs, pay the extra $5 and go to green sub. The Cubana is the perfect sandwich if you ask me, but if you're feeling original I'd go with the Turkey Bacon melt. Basically whatever you try is going to A1. They make daily fresh pulled pork and it's too good. Don't be dumb and miss out on a little piece of Fayetteville. Go to green sub!"}, {"review_id": "vx_fRVSoQSTogJHD5RoWxg", "user_id": "CDZQZ3JB2es4wBH5Ng83EA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "The ONLY bad thing about this place are the hours.

I think they are good but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat them. I'm sure it's probably just me but they ask of you want a large or small sub and because I couldn't see anywhere what the difference was between the two I picked larger which turned out to be 12 inches. I had to take home half but that it ok but they will wrap it up for you very nicely"}, {"review_id": "tBw_K1B81DhecYL3QRvUNg", "user_id": "0MhLGa0A0oSfOKi6InuFbQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "Amazing sandwich.

Local dudes, making killer hot or cold sandwiches, decent price and quick service. You can also create your own sandwich. Added bonus: done in for good music selection.

I highly recommend the hot Tuscan Turkey Melt."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/green-submarine-fayetteville?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
