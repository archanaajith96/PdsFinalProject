Those are one of a kind, it seems, though many places nowadays try their hand at the ubiquitous sandwich. I will say that Lenny's does it right.It comes with a lot of beef in different sizes: 5 inches, 7 1/2 inches, 10 inches, or 15 inches -- all on white, wheat or multi-grain bread. The cheese is great and melts perfectly into the sandwich (and the beef). You can add lettuce, tomatoes, mayo for no charge. Other add-ons include jalapenos, mustard, banana peppers, green peppers, etc. I added the hot pepper relish sauce for no charge -- HIGHLY RECOMMEND. It's got a great kick to it, but it's not overly spicy. And it's free, so don't be a wuss!Combo meals come with chips and a drink. They offer more kinds of chips than Jimmy John's, including sour cream and onion, BBQ, salt and vinegar, plain, cheddar and sour cream, jalapeno, etc. I was super hungry and ordered the 10-inch Philly steak with sour cream and onion chips and a small drink ...that was about three hours ago and I'm still full to the brim.They feature more than just steak subs. They have their cold options like Italian, or hot options like meatball subs. There are many kinds of subs that can be customized with all the toppings.BEWARE: We had to wait 15-20 minutes to receive our food because the place was PACKED TO THE BEJEESUZ during lunch (noon to 1 p.m.). Get there around noon or you'll be waiting a little. But, it's really worth it and the subs are solid."}, {"review_id": "lW_OjBKGYFIR-zfS2yx71A", "user_id": "l6zBxLW2gQpTVCej1oijJw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/18/2016", "text": "Going to keep this review short and sweet and I might elaborate later but right now my sister's ignoring me while I sit and wait on our food at our table at Olive Garden. This is me using my time wisely. I can't just not not leave a review for Lenny. Lenny's always been nice to me with his massive sub sandwiches he serves up. And I mean just massive, jaw aching hearty sandwiches. I'm writing this after a little red wine so excuse my vivid details but I always order em hot at Lenny's. Cold sandwiches are fine but I like mine's toasty and made with love and that's what this place does and I've mentioned this many times I'm a sandwich lover so I don't mind it being pricey. I got the philly steak and it came with a decadent amount of steak and it was super juicy and flavorful!!!"}, {"review_id": "vkVs-L8oxXogy3CkO92MYg", "user_id": "CUl5DtProrE74m6o2DPlAA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "Under staffed, sat for 15 minutes for a 10 inch sub with chips and a soda. Had to get it to go. Less meat then a subway sub and over 11 dollars. Two thumbs down.

The food was good. I thought a little pricey for what it is. (I am also from philly so i guess it is my own bias) I didnt care that the beef was seasoned I am use to it just being beef and meat flavor. I got the combo which includede a drink and a side and you can choose from a large cooke or chips. The cookie was really good. yum. I would go back. just not my idea of a cheese steak. lol"}, {"review_id": "-69CAZMDrbqmmYG0jIyIDg", "user_id": "v3G7noa3wxLxjiTJwhhnag", "rating": 2.0, "date": "6/2/2017", "text": "I love your subs, but you guys have horrible hours and days.  I have driven to your location to get a sub and more often than not your closed.

I ordered the Italian sub Lenny's way. The bread was very good and the sub was extremely flavorful. It tastes so good! The meat was really juicy and flavorful, unlike the 2 slices of dry salami on a jimmy john's sub sandwich.
