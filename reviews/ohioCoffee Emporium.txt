Other than their coffee, I've also had their baked goods and lunch offerings and all were A-OK! It's a great place to meet with friends, meet with colleagues, read or relax by yourself, or even just to make a to-go order. I also love that they have a small area for other goods and gifts sold by local vendors and even appliances to make coffee at home. It is literally your neighborhood coffee shop."}, {"review_id": "JKldkI_XTS35uTZTyyRMyA", "user_id": "fiScG_wgq8KIDrKAlcGuiA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Absolutely the best coffee in Cincinnati no question.

I love the vibe here is so motivating yet relaxing at the same time LOL! I'm not a big coffee fan but the tea here is amazing. So much to choose from. I also love their breakfast sandwiches quiches and muffins. My ultimate favorite muffin is the cinnamon coffee cake muffin. Sweet baby Jesus it's amazing! I haven't had lunch here but I heard it was really good as well I'm sure I will try that next. Every time I've come in the morning I can typically find parking at a meter relatively close so no issues there however, I'm not sure what it looks like around lunchtime or in the evening.They also sell really cool Cincinnati swag!"}, {"review_id": "2YU4jNe-n0e0dLzzE2I3sg", "user_id": "wpDIIY4NCsXSAJR2kOeRZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/6/2018", "text": "This is by far my favorite coffee shop study spot in town.

Coffee Emporium is one of the best hidden gems in OTR. I say hidden because every time I've been, it's had steady food traffic but I can usually find a table to sit. It is pretty spacious for being a coffee shop in OTR! A lot of people come here to study/do work. The menu isn't too big but that's because it's all so good! I get the chicken salad which is delicious paired with the pasta salad. My MIL got the eggplant goat cheese panini and it was seriously SO good (I stole some). Service was fast and the staff there I have encountered were all genuine and kind!!"}, {"review_id": "yRS33URxepxtuCoIF7oXtw", "user_id": "tgeFUChlh7v8bZFVl2-hjQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/8/2017", "text": "Coffee Emporium is some of the best coffee. It has other stuff too of course. The coffee is what everyone really wants. It has a good selection of healthy food items. There's many organic and vegan options. I had the Kenyan coffee with the sweet potato vegetable wrap for lunch. It's about $2 for a regular drip coffee, so it's not too pricey. They have several kinds you pour yourself. It also has many fancier drinks. The latte and mocha stuff is a bit more. It also has a menu of food. The have many choices for vegans. A lot of the pastries are gluten free. Food is either made fresh or it's in the case where you order. A good choice is a wrap, which there are several to choose from. The sweet potato vegetable wrap is made with rice and other vegetables. It has a few couches and tables to sit at. It's pretty quiet because the music isn't too loud.

The shop is located in Downtown Cincinnati surrounded by trolley tracks. It has an old warehouse/industrial feel to it. The place was crowded. When my group arrived there was no line. However after we placed our order the place was slammed with long lines.The staff was super friendly and helpful. The food was good. My only suggestion for improvement and the only reason I did not award 5 stars was the unisex bath room with a key on a metal spoon. The spoon was all smudged with figure prints and did not inspire confidence in The cleanliness of the unisex toilet spoon. I get why an urban downtown restaurant my need to have the bathrooms looked but to just have a single bath room with such large crowds seems insufficient. But I do recommend this coffee shop it has a fun feel and again the food was good."}, {"review_id": "-eCsXz8zKt7Q4e9Ztdlo2w", "user_id": "0SN9mJcysBmGavrnq2uUEw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Love this place, great coffee and food is delicious.

I think many people would agree with me, because it is always busy and bustling.  However they easily move us all through the line and are very friendly.  One word to the wise however - if you are lactose intolerant/prefer milk alternatives in your coffee, I have often gotten chunky soy milk (either due to lack of ordering it or forgetting to shake the carton before pouring).

I typically frequent the Hyde Park location but had a visitor from out of town so decided to try the OTR location. We were not disappointed. Friendly staff, cute and quirky atmosphere, and yummy drinks/food!I got the breakfast burrito (w/o bacon) and it came with a nice cup of salsa on the side. It was really good, had great flavor, and was a nice portion size compared to some of the giant burritos at other restaurants. Had eggs and some veggies inside, looked like it was made under a panini press. My visitor had a raspberry scone and they even offered to warm it up for her!There are a lot of great drip coffee choices as well as coffee drinks, teas, juices, etc. I went with the Jasmine green tea as pictured. Lots of good gift items like chocolates, mugs, coffee accessories, coffee grounds, and locally made cards/postcards. Looove all the Charley Harper mugs and coffee bags designs.There were plenty of tables and seats available at around 11am on a Saturday, even got a metered parking spot right in front. It is in a great location to walk around downtown as well, less than a half mile from the Contemporary Arts Center and many other places to visit. I highly recommend giving it a try!"}, {"review_id": "SPg5CQxXMiCBFTqZHP8nZA", "user_id": "pP0aQcn7TdChh3bGT1iLjA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/28/2017", "text": "Dirty Chai was fantastic.  I also ended up grabbing some beans to bring back home as well because it smelled so good.  Everything I was hoping for in a good, local coffee shop."}, {"review_id": "mwIOYiGff_b6bnOS0aeX_A", "user_id": "n-Ev0euXMKtN_SJFR3XNFA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/7/2017", "text": "This particular location earns five stars because it feels exactly the way you want a coffee shop to feel.
