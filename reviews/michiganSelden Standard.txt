Expect to pay a pretty penny, but also expect creative and delicious dishes. Definitely keep in mind that they serve \"small plates,\" meaning that one item off the menu likely will not fill you up. The most recent time I went was for brunch on Easter. The brisket hash was amazing. I've never enjoyed poking a fork into food as much as I did with their cubes of brisket. It was like a hot knife through butter, but a hot fork in meat. Their pork belly is also incredible. Probably wasn't great for my health, but it was great for my soul.Will definitely come back again."}, {"review_id": "f5EOW6KVoqrYiCrIZ8yqBQ", "user_id": "0GsgmFd2e2RYBHLZwG2w1g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Tapas, otherwise known as SMALL plates, are best enjoyed with friends who are not afraid to spend some money and are looking more for an experience and adventure for their palate and less for feeling stuffed after a meal. Similar to other diners who have had dinner here, I acknowledge the delicious and unique flavors that Selden Standard has to offer - however, the 4 stars for my review could easily be changed to $$$$ as the portions and price can be a little difficult to stomach.The waitstaff is very friendly and have great suggestions for things to order. Although the menu is seasonal and cycles in and out, just about everything on the menu is tasty and offers a strong international flavor. The staff recommends 2-3 plates per diner and I would agree given the portions. With veggie dishes ranging from $12 - $15 and protein dishes ranging $15 - $30, the price to dine can easily reach $50 a person BEFORE drinks and dessert.General tips:-Pastas are slightly heavier portioned than other plates and most are things you would not find at an Olive Garden.-Talk to the staff! They're there to help you get the most out of the meal and oftentimes will point you to things you never would have ever thought of trying. Just because you don't know what something on the menu is does not mean it's not delicious.-Reserve a table online and don't worry about parking - there's plenty of streetside."}, {"review_id": "rmz5FsqY-kJ8KT3H1aVg4A", "user_id": "HzqfrgSrnqcsRI2dOWtubA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Since opening this place has went down in quality and prices went up. I truly have never understood the warm tap water in a fancy glass thing that is just a personal pet peeve I do understand it supposed to aid in digestion. Aside from this I do not understand how paying $13 for chorizo and eggs when you can drive 10 minutes 2 Southwest and get much more quality and quantity and support a true homegrown restaurant Mom and Pop Shop versus a kitschy subway tile lined walls with mustache wax and tattoos to try and sell you the ambiance so you do not notice the food. It is a shame I had such higher hopes. But would rather walk two buildings down to Honest John's and get real food with real people. Or have a beer and belly up at Jumbo's where it still Cass Corridor and not Midtown. But that's just my two bits.

Just go. You won't be disappointed. I travel to Detroit for business every six to eight weeks and I crave the Selden Standard vegetable carpaccio every day between. It is that good. Also the liver pâté was a special one time and I tried it, even though I rarely order liver. It had cherries in it with a fantastic balance of sweet and savory. Last time I went it was on the regular menu, which was nice to see. Don't get attached to your favorite cocktail. They change the craft cocktails every time I go.

The menu features uncommon flavor combinations and local, seasonal ingredients, all shareable. About a third of the menu is focused on vegetables. And if I were to just list the ingredients, beets, carrots, cauliflower, I may induce a yawn, if any reaction at all. However, there is a reason why this restaurant is packed even on a cold, rainy Sunday evening. We selected a number of different small plates to start:* Marinated roasted beets in an avocado cream topped with julienned kohlrabi root and a sprinkling of pepitas for added crunchiness. This was my friend's favorite dish.* Sweet, roasted carrots were topped with feta, with a touch of honey. I loved the taste of root vegetables, roasted until charred. I so loved the contrast between the sweet carrots and the mildly briny flavor, crumbled but creamy feta and could have inhaled the entire plate.* The plump mussels, in the spicy sauce, were also delicious. Spicy sausage crumbles and grilled garlic points finished the dish.* I liked the tender-roasted trout with crispy skin. * Mid-meal, we broke down and ordered the puffy flatbread (such a misnomer) after having seen plates being hurried to numerous tables. Served with an extraordinarily creamy stracciatella cheese and topped with olive oil and Balsamic reduction, the dish was quite lovely.For dessert, we enjoyed:* Caramelized white chocolate tart with bursts of tart cranberries nicely complemented with orange creamsicle ice cream.* The sesame seed halawa, covered in a thin layer of chocolate ganache, was delicious. Served with sesame ice cream and topped with chopped pistachios, the dessert offered an unexpected combination of flavors.Service was friendly and courteous.The parking lot to the side of the building is small. Street parking was available close-by, however."}, {"review_id": "miVBcD7rUXUP6wI02kSW6Q", "user_id": "pD7rL5MWRk_GURxoMYnstg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "First time at Selden did not disappoint!

Yes, this place can be hard to get into - with limited reservations available and a long list of faithful regulars you could be looking at a 2 hour wait for dinner on the weekend. Reserve or show up early. The menu is worth the wait though. While it can seem both small and yet intimidating at first glance, I have never been disappointed with a single bite. The servers are also well informed and thoughtful and can be extremely helpful with suggestions and recommendations. The potions are always generous and there's plenty of side options and well-priced small plate accompaniments. We found the perfect balance with 3 entrees and 2 small plates for 3 adults. I would highly recommend visiting Selden Standard for both brunch and dinner - I cannot pick a favorite between the 2 meals. It's a classy but relaxed place to take a \"visiting from out of town friend\" or even spend a romantic evening."}, {"review_id": "HCrL1nLiY_p8vG2L4xXy6g", "user_id": "djuSWNVq6YHXiTzxG6KMDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "I had read a few recommendations the the Selden so my wife and I went to try it out on a Friday night. It was busy, but we only had to wait around 5-10 minutes for a table. It is a large restaurant with a well stocked bar. They have the industrial, concrete decor going on which looked fine. Our waiter, Andrew came and took time to explain the menu (big plates vs. small plates) and the current specials. We were both hungry, so chose two small plates and one big plate to share. We also ordered drinks from their extensive cocktail menu.  Andrew brought out some bread with butter (they churn their own) and apologized that our drinks were taking so long. The bread was crusty and the butter sweet and creamy.We received our drinks about the same time as our first dish. I got an old fashioned and my wife ordered a proper northern cocktail. The drinks were boozy, interesting and satisfying. Our first dish was the grilled romaine. It was an interesting take on a Cesar salad with the romaine grilled for an added smokeyness. It was delicious.Our next dish was a special, parsnips with creme fresh. They were starchy, a bit sweet and cooked enough to be soft, but not mushy. The added creme fresh was perfect and the dishes complex flavor melted in our mouths.The last dish was the pheasant sugo, a larger pasta dish with pheasant, pasta, pancetta, spinach and pistachio. The pasta was made in house and perfect. One or two bites of the pheasant was a bit dry, but the rest had soaked up the sauce and was moist, meaty and flavorful. The sauce was creamy and a touch spicy, it complemented all the parts very well.We were both very pleased with the quality and flavors of our food. And the price! For all this and a lot of it being hand made or locally sourced for around $60 was awesome. Also, a shout out to Andrew our waiter. He was always stopping by to refill water and was so well informed on the menu and answered all our questions, bravo!I can see why this place is so popular. Awesome food, reasonable prices and excellent service. We will definitely come again when we are in town."}, {"review_id": "3yLkBASOt4kWZFxva_JfSQ", "user_id": "eI-g-8q3MvcG4ROIOcK58A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "I have heard a rumor that this is where all of the local chefs eat.

I had been itching to go for years, so on a very rainy evening I surprised my fiance on our anniversary.After attempting to make last minute reservations the Friday before and realizing every reservation was full, we decided to try our luck. They opened at 5 p.m. for the dinner crowd, and we got there around 5:45. We walked in and were seated immediately. We lucked out, honestly, because a flurry of people bustled in mere minutes after we snagged one of the final tables. NOTE: They keep tables available for walk ins, but there's only so many.We started with drinks: I had the Son of Man -- some tequila concoction that tasted unbelievably fresh. For a minute I thought the cocktail was delivered by the Sugar House. It was that good, and even at $10 a pop I got a couple. I had to because my veins require a certain amount of alcohol each day after 5 p.m. It's a medical condition. The lady sipped on gin for the evening, and when we left she ran towards the car in the rain. Basically, the gin got her drunk enough to ignore the precipitation.Ah, the food. First, the menu is pretty respectable price-wise. Some items cost more than 30 bones (i.e. whole trout), but otherwise it's actually not that bad for a Detroit restaurant of the year winner.We started with the flatbread (minus olives -- I don't trust people who eat olives). This bread was amazingly fresh, like it was just made minutes before we arrived fresh. It could easily feed 2-4 people, and yes we ate it all. The balsamic mixed with the cheese was orgasmic. For our meals she ordered the pasta with broccoli, and I had the lamb ribs. Again, the taste and textures made me salivate before the food even entered my mouth. The ribs come with yogurt and some sort of sweet and sour concoction, which almost tasted like a tart remoulade. The ribs were so tender, and the mix with the yogurt and sauce was.... Aw god, I'm salivating again.If there was a knock on anything, it could be the service. Then again, once we received our drinks we felt like service picked up. Also, it was busy as all hell on a Saturday evening.I must say, this was one of the best dining experiences I ever had in Detroit or anywhere. The menu is big enough to find and try different items, the prices won't break the wallet of a lower middle-class pleb like me, and the chefs and bartenders are top notch. I challenge anyone to eat here and not be impressed."}, {"review_id": "fM2cIhJSRn0bXgPhrifFRg", "user_id": "evO49j_YbLiUEpPvyXpMVw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/6/2017", "text": "I came here from the recommendation of a friend who claims this is the best restaurant in Detroit - a hefty title to live up to. With expectations high and bellies hungry, we ordered the polenta al forno, roasted beets and their slow roasted pork. The menu was original, the presentation beautiful, and the flavors paired very well with each other. The space was very definitive of Detroit - located in an unassuming building but once inside, had a modern set up, an open kitchen, and lots of natural light. My only complains are that 1) we were sat in a booth a little too close for comfort from the couple next to us and 2) the seasoning on the beet salad wasn't well spread out so some parts were a lot saltier than other, even though it was still my favorite dish on the menu. Overall I think this is one of those restaurants that are quintessential to the food scene in the new Detroit."}, {"review_id": "vVTCvZQL1_w6T-6kgNMgmg", "user_id": "1iFQUc7X-gTEjIrviOwlhw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "My husband and I ate here on a rare night out, and it was a bit of a mixed bag. If I could rate it 3 1/2 stars, I would. The location is a bit out of the way, but parking was easy enough. Though the disaffected hostess left something to be desired. I hate walking into a place just to feel like I am bothering them. You're a hostess at a restaurant: stop acting like you don't care. It's not pleasant, and it leaves a bad first impression. Our waiter wasn't much better, very little personality, but he was efficient.  This is mostly a small plates restaurant, which I usually really enjoy because I like being able to try a bit of everything. But many of the menu items didn't necessarily appeal to us, so we ended up with at least three pastas, the smoked potatoes, and a couple desserts.  First the best parts of the meal, the chicken sugo pasta was outstanding. We were basically fighting over it, fork-stabbing each other for the last few bites. The lobster ravioli were also quite yummy, and the desserts were creative and delicious. I really have to give a big 9 thumbs up (What the hell is that?!) to the pastry chef, because I felt it was the most inventive part of the meal. We had a corn cake topped with blueberries and the pumpkin sundae. They sound deceptively simple, but they were really delicious, and composed nicely. The dishes that didn't really hit the mark in my opinion, were the smoked potatoes with dill and Comte cheese and the gnocchi dish. The potatoes lacked flavor, even though it should have had plenty with the strong flavors of dill and Comte. And the potatoes were a little hard, probably because they were too big and lifeless, like they were just laying there sadly on the plate, no real presentation to speak of. The gnocchi were okay, but it had toasted pumpkin seeds sprinkled on top, which would have been a nice addition if they were the shelled kernels and not the whole chewy seed pods. I spent most of the time chewing those seed casings and lost all the flavor of the rest of the pasta dish. It was just such an odd choice. Most of the dishes were good, some were great, and some not quite up to par of what I was expecting at such an highly acclaimed restaurant. I would definitely try Selden Standard again, though, to sample more desserts, if nothing else."}, {"review_id": "wNbkzGaI1E-iUYwz3mxBFQ", "user_id": "FcDY7FRo-QRc7wTOkRZIBw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/12/2018", "text": "The food is really good.

We ordered the beets which were delicious, the grilled halloumi which had such a great blend of sweetness and spice, and the smoked potatoes. The potatoes!!! So simple and perfect. My guy also got the lamb ragu which he devoured. We both agreed that some of the food was just on the edge of being overly salty but we both prefer strong seasoning so it worked well for us. Be sure to request the bread and butter!  For dessert we ordered the chocolate hawala - it was like a high end frozen snickers bar and I say that with the utmost respect! Drinks were pricey.

Lackluster,, the only thing good was the toast.Stuffed Squid: Another lackluster dish. I totally don't get it.
