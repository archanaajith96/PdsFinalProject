I was not disappointed. When I got there they asked if I had a reservation, which I did not, but I was seated within a couple of minutes anyways. It is a fairly small place, so a reservation would probably be a good idea on a weekend. I got the mac and cheese with pulled pork. It was amazing. I thought it was going to be a smaller meal, but it was actually quite a bit of food. It was a decent sized tray with a thin layer of mac and cheese, and the pork was spread into a line in the middle. I was glad I got it with the pork because it was really good. On its own I think it would be a fairly normal mac and cheese. I definitely recommend adding your favorite meat option on top. I would go back and probably would order the same thing. Definitely worth a try."}, {"review_id": "lLZNQ-IFtv1vTlbotZac8w", "user_id": "hnkG_WupKIQ8yGdxewg_6w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "THIS WAS IT!!!! I am so impressed! When I first relocated to the area, I saw this restaurant but I wasn't slightly in-the-know of it. I decided to take myself here following work for a solo meal. I ordered the platter with ribs, turnip + mustards, and garlic rice. For a cocktail, I ordered the Southern and Houston sangria, and I took the banana pudding as a desert to go.When I attended the restaurant it was roughly 4:00 PM  and I was seated promptly. I was the only person in the restaurant dining. The waiter was very pleasant. As it was my first, he shared with me he menu and explained everything to me thoroughly. The food was banging. I mean this sincerely. I love a good mustard and turnip mix. The greens were spot on. Just enough kick and spice. Seasoned perfectly and I loved the fact that the then turkey meat was visible and plentiful. I guess that's the Savannah girl in me. The ribs were cooked perfectly and flavorful. The rice as well.I loved the Southern and Houston sangria. The watermelon purée was sweet but also not overly sweet in the drink. It was a great mixture. The banana pudding lastly is a nice finish. I've never had banana pudding with ginger snaps. I'm not opposed, it was different but still tasty. As soon as I left, I called my mother raving. Just goes to show that the exterior of a building has nothing to do with the greatness of its food and soul. Good job to the folks at Gilbert."}, {"review_id": "qIrxjEzI1VnmjEqs7AuWTQ", "user_id": "05MpsTohoxyAOOQY7SmGDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "First stop in Jacksonville-AMAZING.The ambiance: So from the outside this place is unassuming. Looks like a pretty standard BBQ place. Once we stepped inside, I was pleasantly surprised. The decor is very unique; the tables were all nicely set and the vibe was homey, yet modern. Genius. 5 stars there.Service: Our waitress whose name I don't  recall ( darn ) was very friendly and offered some great suggestions. She was patient and prompt. There is an open faced kitchen, so we could see the cooks going to work. They appeared to work efficiently and meticulously despite the pressure of being \"watched\". Our food came out quickly.5 stars here too. FOOD: Now, the most important part. The food was great! Right now, I am only eating sea creatures. I had the Conch Dip, which is not only unique, but very tasty! I would go back just for that. I also has the cheese grits. I am a cheese grits fanatic and would say these would be top of the line. Cheesy. Creamy. Hearty! My friend has the smothered chicken plate, with greens and dressing. She said she really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, she had a cold so her taste buds were out of wack. Despite that, she said everything was flavorful. I also had the \"Red Special\" Sangria which was minty and yummy! We had the apple pie dessert, which was not a personal favorite, but... I'm sure someone would enjoy it. I'm not holding it against them.  5 stars here! This place would be great for a date night, lunch, brunch, dinner. They don't have a bar, so if you're looking for that you won't find it. However, the uniqueness of the menu, great food and ambience should draw you in at least to try! Also we were able to use a $15 for $30 deal which was awesome.

I had the Smoked Beef Brisket with Cheese Grits and Crispy Brussels Sprouts for the entrée. The Brisket was tender and smoky, the grits were creamy and the Brussels sprouts were crisp and smoky. Finally, my wife and I shared a Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Pie with Vanilla Ice Cream. The pie was delicious: warm, sweet, chocolaty, gooey and filled with crunchy pecans. The ice cream was a nice touch.

It reminded me of the cartoon scent hand that wraps around your body and floats you to its source.When you walk in, it's a big open space with a really high ceiling and an open kitchen in the back.

I am so glad I talked with her.   This was fantastic and very filling.  My friend had his usual with the Anna's Mac and cheese with the drunken brisket.    This time he ate it all.  The side was the greens and they are delicious. There are now 3 places to go to try Gilbert's. I have not heard a bad thing about the other 2 places and Gilbert's social always treats you right.  Great desserts too.  This time between the soup and the main course, I was filled up.

Gilbert is southern cuisine with a twist. Since last time I have a sample, I was planning to visit them when I am in Jacksonville. The slogan is eat drink and living. It is truly the way of life. We started Charred Jalapeño Tamales. This dish is bed with smoked chop beef brisket. The brisket was well marinated with great flavor. The top go with spicy salsa. Which company the dish very well. I haven't have a tamale this way. The tamale paste was well balanced to go with the brisket. The next dish crispy smoke Pork bell. The pork belly was Season with yellow spice. It lay over the butter pecan purée. The outside skin is crispy while the second layer fat was melting away at your tongue while final touch to bite the meat. Very good. Out last dish is the southern ramen. This dish is ok compared to the first two dish. Overall the service is perfect. The chef skill is great.

Well, we had trouble getting out of our van, as Walt's lost his cane again and he is using his scooting thing that has tennis balls on the bottom.  He goes through a can of tennis balls every day it seems like. I hope he finds his cane soon. He probably left it at the bus stop somewhere, even though he doesn't ride the bus, just likes to watch the people and read his paper.Gilbert's came recommended from friends in our neighborhood, and I trust these friends with food recommendations.  I also saw Gilbert in a picture with Oprah, and that was really nice too.  I was hoping to see Oprah last night but I guess she was not in town. When we pulled in to the parking lot, I was surprised to see that the restaurant was smaller than expected, and a burnt orange color like the couch we used to have maybe fifty years ago or so, I'm not sure. The building does not look like much, but I wasn't able to notice one way or the other because I had to help get Walt inside. The air inside the restaurant was nice and cool, which is good because Walt sweats a lot, and it smelled of varying spices I didn't expect out of a good southern place.  Could be good, we would see.  Walt and I settled into a table in the corner.  Walt has problems keeping food in his mouth, and when he does, it's all in his teeth, so I prefer corners and turning him around so his back faces the room.  He is cute but no one likes collards in the teeth or on the shirt.We chose to order the drop biscuits, the Moroccan cauliflower, and a southern bowl with drunk turkey, which sounded a whole lot like I wanted to be that turkey since a few hours before.  The biscuits came out quickly and jumping hot, and were on a pretty platter with fresh pickles, pickled peppers, some green jelly sauce that tasted a bit like apple butter, and honey butter.  Those biscuits had cheese, corn, and jalepeno stuffed in there, and while they weren't the kind I grew up making, they sure were delicious. They were the crumbly kind of biscuits that don't really keep shape once you pull off a piece, but you don't really care because it is that good.  We had four biscuits, two a piece, and I kept eyeing Walt to see if he would leave part of his second one for me to finish. He didn't.The Moroccan cauliflower came out next and bless it, that cauliflower dish was the prettiest vegetable plate I have ever seen in my entire life.  I never thought vegetables were supposed to be gourmet food.  They were meant to be fried, or buttered, or if you're busy you just steam the life out of them and make your kids eat them or else they don't get dessert.  This cauliflower was something else.  It was roasted in strong Moroccan spices, and came with what appeared to be hummus but according to the menu was actually cauliflowers and cashews pureed together. Sundried tomatoes and large cloves of roasted garlic and some leafy things I never saw before were sprinkled on top.  It was lovely.  I kept most of it away from Walt because he has what the doctor termed a \"delicate stomach\" and I really want to sleep through the night tonight.Walt's southern bowl was also delicious.  Garlic rice, topped with soft field peas, collard greens, more biscuit, and this drunk turkey that was so soft Walt didn't even need his teeth in to enjoy it.  The individual flavors in the bowl mixed very well, and every bite of that bowl brought new combinations of flavors together.  It was addicting and exciting to sneak a few bites of that bowl, as each bite had a complexity I really never had before with southern food.  Southern food is good, don't get me wrong, and I enjoy food that's been stewed in lard to an inch of its life just as much as the next person, but this food somehow was not only southern, and flavorful, it managed to be both bold and delicate at the same time.  We tried to eat all of our food, but indigestion started in early and we had to box the rest up and shuffle back out to the van. We will be back.I will give this a five star. Walt's stomach hung in there, and we found his cane the next morning! A great evening.  I would like to meet Gilbert next time and Oprah, too."}, {"review_id": "zkacfHVpRZijUi--gtBATA", "user_id": "CksINCGWWrOAr7SsZPmIKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "Lots of surprises.
