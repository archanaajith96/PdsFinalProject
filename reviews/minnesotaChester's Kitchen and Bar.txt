And I the \"just want a small salad\" salad.  Everything tasted fresh and dressings were a perfect match.  For mains she had the protein bowl.  Chicken rice broccoli mixed greens Edamame and Asian dressing.  Chester's chicken is awesome.  I had the blackberry jalapeño burger w sweet potato fries.  I tell you the burger cooked perfectly.  Just the perfect amount of everything.   From seasoning to the toppings. Omg! Perfectly fried cheese curds. Fresh jalapeño  w the right anoint of heat. And the sweet blackberry preserves.  Burger was just right. Not to big not to small.   The funny thing is. The server suggested. And I was like I just went to Newt's yesterday.   I don't need another.  But I'm glad I did. - Chester's blows Newt's out of the water.  We ended our meal with their banana cream pie.  The crushed pretzel and gram cracker crust was a nice twist.  Thanks Chester's!  Second time here was better then the first!  Strongly suggest stopping here for lunch if your visiting mayo or stopping by on your way to Minneapolis. Or if your traveling through on the cycle. It's worth it.  Hats off to the chef and crew.  Wow. ."}, {"review_id": "Wby8pJiCkfcabbI786UVOA", "user_id": "L4jTRPDgQVLaGOleXh3j0A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Brunch at Chedster, pretty good, but not physically hot, just luke warm.  Don't think Rochester has a good breakfast spot.  Liked the concept, of spinach, Feta cheese, garlic And chicken.  Couldn't taste the garlic and feta, but gave me ideas for fixing my own.  Chester's should be ashamed to ever serve their bread pudding, old bread and caramel syrup and whipped   Dried, partially heated, server didn't offer to heat it up.  He said he would tell the cook, like that is  going to  help.  No nuts, dates raisins, no spices.  probably a quarters worth of ingredience.   If you can't do better then tht, take it off ff the menue."}, {"review_id": "2iqdwBiKMuiIXDcx1pYmtA", "user_id": "3Eo-Sadwm7RgLAIjhDYtpQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Popular American restaurant in downtown Rochester that gets pretty packed for lunch and dinner.

The bread rolls were a great start to the meal. They're really a cross between a biscuit and a roll. The best of both worlds. We started with the legendary brie cheese curds, which lived up to my expectations. They are to die for! The brie had such a great flavor, while the batter covering the curds was light, airy, and had a delicious flavor.The cranberry walnut salad was a great palate cleanser before we proceeded to our main course. The lobster mac and cheese was incredible. The bread crumbs on top gave the dish a great crunch that balanced the rich, smooth texture of the cheese.Not to be forgotten is the Jambalaya, which offered a delicious variety of meats captured in a sea of spices and flavor. The rice was cooked to perfection.Our waiter, Levi, was fantastic. We had a great experience, and will be back for more cheese curds!"}, {"review_id": "VktpTBbaGHB-sVAmbYxoTQ", "user_id": "1Ig4aodzuH-tIqjXumL_Bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Don't let the restaurant in a mall location discourage you. Sign at entrance states voted best in Rochester and it's believable. While many posts recommend the rotisserie chicken (and I'm sure it's deserved), the halibut special won the day, followed by a rhubarb tart with vanilla bean ice cream. And we all know there's no daily problem rhubarb can't fix.

The service is okay and the food is okay though sometimes I am pleasantly surprised. My family will eat out here on semi-special occasions and while we've never been all that impressed, nothing is too disappointing either. Good things:Brie cheese curds: I love Brie and fried things and sometimes Wisconsin so it's no wonder these are good, they come out hot and fresh and served in a cute wire basketAhi tuna salad: the last time I was here this was no longer on the menu so not sure if it's a seasonal entree or permanently gone, but the tuna is perfectly cooked and the leaves are always fresh and flavorfulChocolate cake: ahhh, the Chester's Classic. You can never go wrong with chocolate cakeMediocre / bad things:Lobster Mac: very creamy, noodles are a little overdone and sauce is a bit watery. Generous portions of lobsterFish & Chips: great fish fry, mediocre chips. I like to ask for extra lemonIowa pork chops: enjoyed the sweet cinnamon apples that came on the side, could pass on the hash-browns, pork chops themselves were way overdoneAmablu chicken rigatoni: overpowered by the walnuts and blue cheese, but the pasta was cooked well and chicken portions were generousCalamari: always soggy and the sauce that comes with is a weird combination of sweet and spicyThe last time we were here, the hostess was awfully rude, rolling her eyes when we asked for an estimated wait time. Our waiter was beyond friendly and attentive, though, and refilled waters frequently and always checked up to see how things were tasting. This is actually a really frequent pattern in the service, I've never come upon a friendly host / hostess but the waiters and waitresses are always wonderful. Why is that?Prices are on par with most downtown, sit-down places. The quality of food could be better but they definitely do have some good things. The wait can be lengthy so call in advance and make a reservation."}, {"review_id": "YByvl9UuoTsq_r95va2g0g", "user_id": "-S1vOt1NTamYMWjsZi9Wpg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/17/2017", "text": "I had a great time at Chester's with my friends. First of all, the restaurant looks really modern and lovely, and it's very spacious. We came at around 7 PM on a Thursday and were told that our wait for 3 people would be about 20-25 minutes, but we were seated within 15. I ordered two drinks: the Jolly Rancher, and a Strawberry Accomplice Martini. I absolutely love sweet drinks, and these two were great. The martini wasn't insanely sweet, but the Jolly Rancher is just as sweet as you would think it would be. I wouldn't consider either of the drinks strong (but I just graduated from college so my perception of how much a drink should burn might be a bit skewed), but they were enough to get me a little tipsy!My group ordered the nachos to share, and I didn't think they were very good. They didn't taste bad, but the presentation was pretty unattractive and the toppings were very scarce, concentrated on like maybe 4-5 chips. The bread that they provide to every table is excellent. It's warm and soft! I ordered the lobster mac and cheese. The consistency of the sauce is a bit more watery than I would've preferred, but it was still really good. The portions are large, so I probably was only able to eat half of it before giving up. Finally, one of my friends was in the mood for ice cream but they only had various cakes on the dessert menu. However, our server was incredibly accommodating, and brought us scoops of vanilla ice cream with our choice of toppings. Speaking of service, our server was excellent. She was very attentive, making sure that we enjoyed our food and always checking to see if we needed anything. When our food initially came out I was served the wrong dish, and she was extremely apologetic about it and worked really hard to get my dish out as quickly as possible. I would definitely recommend this place, but skip the nachos!"}, {"review_id": "RFxYzLKj2PIAgQMXrNaKNw", "user_id": "IbjkQG8vLbrf_az6jFT2dw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Delicious.

It is between 4-6PM and 9-12AM. All beers, wines, and cocktails are $2 off and the happy hour food menu is pretty fantastic as well. I walked over from the Doubletree and found it pretty easily inside the mall. I ordered the Korean Angry Wings and the Chicken Lettuce Wraps for dinner, and had the Jolly Rancher cocktail and a short Mudpuppy Porter to wrap up my meal. The appetizers really hit the spot. I was surprised with how well they incorporated gojuchang sauce in with the chicken wings marinade. The flavors of the chicken lettuce wrap fillings also reminded me of the homemade wonton fillings I make, which is a huge compliment if I may say so myself. As for the drinks, the Jolly Rancher cocktail tasted surprisingly like the hard candy! It was also much stronger than I expected for something that tasted so good. Whew! I would definitely recommend trying one of the items on their cocktail menu, I think they do a great job with the mixed drinks!"}, {"review_id": "KuAd_01VuxThDqXBapwYww", "user_id": "SPmaZWRB_6RqSifoMw4dsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/13/2017", "text": "Chester's seems like the go-to restaurant for the majority of Rochester.  The have inside seating, in the mall and their main building.  They also have put-door seating which is great in the summer.Their menu is diverse and you are bound to find something for everyone.  The health nuts, pasta lovers, salad enthusiast and the old-timers.  Everything is good but nothing mind-blowing.  Their ribs are amazingly tender and their rotisserie chicken is delicious.  I do enjoy their  chocolate cake for dessert.  I don't like their Brie Cheese Curds very much, they tend to not come out hot and I don't think the Brie works well."}, {"review_id": "aa292F0-5IfV44Jwkuv42A", "user_id": "IeRlvi3QWgO1KOqZvYtWTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/14/2018", "text": "Good place for people to go if they're in town, want a nice place to go, and want decent food.

We had our expectations high.We came here for brunch and the items on the menu looked appetizing.  We ordered a breakfast meal that was supposed to include two sausages, eggs and hash brown. Those were the ingredients listed on the menu so we expected to receive these items. We didnt think any special ingredients would be added to the dish, especially since this restaurant is so close to the mayo clinic where people could have food sensitivities.When our food arrived it was delivered with only one sausage.  The other sausage was replaced with bacon. Turns out the kitchen ran out of sausages but didnt bother to advise us about it.  Instead they continued to cook our order and substituted the other sausage with bacon (which we don't eat).  The hash browns were also not just hashbrowns. They were mixed with cream and cheese and they did not have any regular hash browns with just potatoes. The only thing we could eat were the eggs.When we advised our server of this, she was apologetic and didnt charge of us for the meal. We were thankful for her customer service. Thats the only reason why I am giving this place three stars.  In the future I recommend the restaurant updating their menu with the true ingredients of the dish so patrons don't have misconceptions on what they will be receiving. I also recommend the kitchen advising of lack of ingredients and asking the patrons if they still want the dish before substituting in other items and cooking it."}, {"review_id": "Ms3dK5LIpGvYBujbiuQ21g", "user_id": "f1YtcQL_unG5dKtkuZmEYw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "This is one of the nicer places to Eat in Rochester.  The food is good and predictable but not totally amazing.  Parking is a bit of a pain if you are not staying downtown.  We like going for Sunday brunch during the summer.  The food is fairly healthy if you pick the better options."}, {"review_id": "ZkfnnUwciSwxztuYtzwnLA", "user_id": "SgbdA3qhhj8mpdXiRWavOA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Order the jumbalaya.

I walk up to the host(esses) and was told they tried to text me but it did not go through successfully. We were literally sitting at the end of the bar right next to where they were standing! It was quite upsetting about their ambivalence about the situation. They all looked young like they were inexperienced. We finally get seated and the rest od the evening went fine. Portions were huge and we all left very full and satisfied. The waitress convinced us to order the full skillet of cornbread. The 3 of us only finished three quarters of it...very buttery, moist...almost too much butter, if that's possible.I ordered the Chester's sampler platter with the rotiserrie chicken, meatloaf, pork chop, and mashed potatoes...it was a great entree, every little part of it, but definitely too much food and way too filling.
