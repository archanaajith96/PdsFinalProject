Scrambled eggs were over cooked and dry. The hash potato round was completely not crispy and unseasoned.  The English muffins whole grill marked were floppy and had an almost wet crumb.  While this is a pretty traditional plate, and it's mainly eggs and bacon, for the price and place there should be no white space visible on the plate... eggs and potatoes are cheap... make them right and cover the plate.  Just because the traditional breakfast is, well basic, didn't mean it should be boring and get less attention in the kitchen.  The Chilaquiles were on point presentation wise but were a dash over sauced which obscured the tortilla's add to the plate.  Great sauce... dash too much.For an appetizer- the French Toast sticks for $9 were a big flop... 3 - 3.5\" sticks and side of hot ganache.  The sticks themselves tasted heavy in old oil perhaps... the burnt oil flavor over powered any intentions of maple in the batter.  The stick serving merely as a vehicle to get ganache from the plate to the mouth.  $9 is absurd!  Spying other plates exiting the kitchen - the more basic they were, the more underwhelming they looked.  Like the basic get based to the newbie as they don't matter.   That's how it feel and looks at least.Service and attention were top notch - and way out performed the food today...  one off experience? ... not sure, but hopefully they aren't coasting so it's worth another visit on faith and atmosphere."}, {"review_id": "_7ZPQK3wuCTDo_7iq3eTsQ", "user_id": "bITAoVxTDsUBSDSykvd8Vg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "If you are vegetarian, Graze's menu may have seemed tricky in the past, but they have introduced a number of veggie options on their new menu, so it's now easy to enjoy a small plate festival alongside fabulous cocktails in what I consider one of the most fab dining spaces to be dining in. You can graze upon amazing, well-prepared food while gazing upon the capitol, imagining a world without Republicans running everything into the ditch.We love the fact that Graze, like Chef Tory's other restaurants, celebrates local farms from cheese to veg. It's a fabulous dynamic, and we are happy to enjoy local ingredients that are lovingly prepared any time we decide to eat out.If you are super cool, you will want to be in Trevor's section. He is an amazing waiter, and has served our table on previous visits, and somehow remembered us tonight, even though our last visit was many months ago. He knows the menu inside out, and will make excellent suggestions. If Trevor is taking care of your table, consider yourself lucky and tip him accordingly.Even though it's been a long time since our first visit to Graze, I have to mention that the highlight of our first visit was the roasted, glazed Brussels sprouts offered on the menu that night. Those sprouts were the first and only time I've ever liked, no, loved them, despite my many previous attempts. I've also quite enjoyed the Bimibap, though I cannot abide the egg involved. I don't care what the people say: a fried egg is gross, and a soft yolk is even worse. Get it without the egg, but do get it with the tofu. Tonight we tried a few of the newer items on the menu. The carrot hummus! Get it, eat it, love it! The compote on top with the harissa--so yummy. We both loved their version of naan with avocado in the batter. It's surprising that the green color survives the cooking and it's super thin and crisp and tender and the richness of the avocado was not lost. Someone let us know if they decide to supersize this dish, because we could eat all of it. Seriously, we want to know. I'd also accept a number of the tiny cast-iron ramekins they serve it in.We also had the cherry and beet salad, and as a couple of vegetarians who think beets taste like dirt, this is a gateway dish for beet enjoyment. Get a bite with cherry, a nice slab of beet, arugula and the nuts and it is super yummy. The beets on their own still taste like dirt, but that is the nature of a beet. It's good to know that they can actually taste good in concert with other flavors, finally.As an experiment, we both tried a vegetarian version of the double smash cheeseburger with the \"impossible burger\" we've been reading about for some time. It's eerily burger like, and it was fun and indulgent to find that the stuff dripping down our hands was the house special sauce and the juice from the fabulous tomato and not the burger itself. The bun is soft, light and perfect as a burger bun. I covet the recipe. The tomato is super flavorful and juicy. Eating this burger was disturbingly enjoyable. Tonight was the latest in a strung-out series of wonderful meals, great cocktails and excellent service at this restaurant. If you have a bad dining experience here, it's probably your fault."}, {"review_id": "43K-Da8AX1RrT6xzlz9H-g", "user_id": "bqhfMozc8Wp1ty_zDOis_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Be prepared to wait for a table for dinner.  Ended up eating at the bar.  Staff was prompt.  Mixed drinks were light on spirits, but still tasty.  The smash burger they offer is probably one of the best burgers I've ever had.  So much flavor that I can't begin to describe.  It was simply amazing.  Food was brought out so quick after ordering.  Great experience over all."}, {"review_id": "uqg3iqsAOrq8Wk3lVM6HrQ", "user_id": "NJknV4a9G_5y-8NOIyk_bg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This spot became my go to place when i am at Madison Wisconsin.

So seriously in fact that when my partner and I tried to go Marigold Kitchen one morning around 9:30, there was already a line out the door. We were both pretty hungry already so we started walking around to scope out other options. There were only a couple people in Graze so we decided to check it out. The place did start to fill up pretty quickly after 9:30 though so plan accordingly. I had woken up that morning with a fierce hankering for hash browns so we ordered those to share. My partner got the breakfast sandwich and I ordered the chilaquiles. The hash browns were actually the most disappointing part of the meal. The hash browns themselves were fine but they came topped with some cheese that had congealed and made the entire dish rather salty. The main dishes were great though - I had a bite of the breakfast sandwich and it was luxuriously rich and delicious. My chilaquiles were a tad salty but still really yummy. I was really pleased to sw chilaquiles on the menu too, since I'm from California and some of my breakfast joints back home carry it but I haven't seen it on the menu a lot here in Madison. Definitely want to come back for dinner sometime. I've also been here for cocktails during brunch time - my friends and I both got the Pamplemousse cocktail and it was great with a side of cheese curds.

The atmosphere was nice and the staff was great but none of our party of 10 seemed pleased with their food and most of us had different items.

Both the view and food are hard to beat. Located in a glass-sided building on the square so at most of the tables you have the Capital building as a backdrop. It's especially pretty at night. Graze is a locally-sourced restaurant meaning that the food is local and the farm/cheese maker, etc. is known by the diner. The menu is small but we have never been disappointed by the selection. We only stop once a year while in town and have noticed that the menu does change but some of our favorites are still available (Kimshi Deviled Eggs). We always start with a cheese plate which you select from a list of 12 various local styles/flavors and is served with toast wedges and preserves. Your server can help with your selection.The food is seriously good. Both the entrees and starters are unique to Graze and are perfectly prepared. The flavors and textures of whatever we have ordered are complex and seasoned just right. The prices are up there but I don't mind paying for food of this quality. Portion size is just right. From past experience the desserts are awesome but you may not have room if you enjoyed an appetizer. Very good coffee.Service has always been good but on our last visit not quite as personal. Food delivery is timely. The beer selection isn't great but you're coming here for the food and I'm sure you will agree to something they have.My only issue this past visit and much of what's keeping my rating from perfect is the lighting. It may have been just our table which was located right next to the window but it was so dark that I had a difficult time seeing my meal and it took away some of my enjoyment of dining. While romantic and offering a better view of the Capital we needed an additional candle. Otherwise the ambience is modern and clean, focusing on the dining experience and not the trappings of what's hanging on the wall.I wish I could give 4.5 stars as we love this place and will keep coming back. This is one of many nice places to eat downtown but the combination of quality of food and the Capital backdrop is what does it for us."}, {"review_id": "4oFFR55sPOrwQrktJOstog", "user_id": "Hcgi-brnL0QOD3_T5JuvmA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/17/2018", "text": "Loved this place; went around happy hour and sat at the bar.  I ordered the Green Hot Chili Peppers cocktail and my friend got the Limp Hibizkit.  Both were delicious!!  We also ordered the cheese curds (HIGHLY recommend) and the Kimchi deviled eggs (also delicious).  I found the staff to be a little on the less-friendly side...not rude by any means, just not overly friendly like you may expect if you were sitting at the bar.  The restaurant itself is a great place, loved the decor and the featured products menu on the walls.  Would definitely suggest as a place on your trip to Madison!"}, {"review_id": "mah8ox3SyyFtzV8T6Gl35w", "user_id": "WcraV_SWmWBvJsSZ81YRwQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "I've been to Graze a few times, mostly for lunch and have always had a fairly good experience.

So when I yelped amd it was proclaimed that the \"Old Fashioned\" restaurant had the best cheese curds in Madison, I was really sad that I was informed that the wait was 45-minutes. So instead, I walked a block down to Graze, also supposedly having one of the best cheese curds in Madison.So much going on on the menu... it was so hard to decide on what to order. Soooo, I ordered several items: * Fried cheese curds, of course! It had the perfect amount of breading and was pretty tasty. The sauce that came with it, I could live without, but overall, the appetizer was nice and flaky. * Biscuits and gravy were the really good. There was a lot of gravy, but it wasn't overpowering. The chicken strips that came on top of the dish was a great touch and the combo of gravy, chicken strips, and biscuits were great.* Chicken and waffles. A large drumstick and wing. Breading was excellent. The waffle that it sat on top of was soft and fluffy. You can't beat the combo of syrup, waffle, and fried chicken. The cinnamon butter that came with it, I could do without as well. But overall, the best part, much like the fried cheese curds, was the breading. This place sure got its breading down!BATHROOM REVIEW: one unisex bathroom at the bottom, main bathrooms upstairs. Two urinals one stall. Stall seemed clean.
