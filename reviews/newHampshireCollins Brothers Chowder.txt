I'm glad I persisted--this is some great soup!  I ordered a pint of the Tuscan Country Vegetable and couldn't drive to my destination fast enough to avoid the torture of smelling this great soup sitting beside me every painfully slow mile of the way. The staff is pleasant, efficient and happy. I can't wait to go back again and again, working my way through their menu selections. If all their offerings are as good as the Tuscan Country Vegetable, I may be forced to ignore my shellfish allergy and lactose intolerance and try a pint of the Clam Chowder!"}, {"review_id": "AgaflU-85w8k4xM_1gu3Dg", "user_id": "53PjYuZ4KJgiYNUnrG75hQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/11/2017", "text": "If you're looking for a fancy shmancy place with linen table cloths, waiter service, and maybe some vino to go with your soup, keep driving. But, if you're willing to overlook the unpretentious exterior and a number of other things, you will find a pretty damn good place to find soup.Collins Brothers Chowder Co is humble little soup shop located not too far from downtown nashua. They offer something like 8-ish soups everyday plus some heat-and-serve meals (pot pie, pot roast, turkey dinner) and one soup for their daily special. Sure I've heard all of their soups are great, but this is flippin New England! My father and I stopped by with the intention of trying some New England clam chowder. We both envoyed our chowder. It was neither pasty nor overly salty. I appreciate how the clams were clearly the star of the soup unlike other places that add a lot of filler (i.e. potatoes). I know clam chowder is supposed to be subtle but I like chowders to have a little more peppers and herbs. Just my preference, though...Also, do spend the extra dollar for a small loaf of bread. I say this not just because I'm a little bit of a fresh bread junkie but also because it was perfect for sopping up that delicious soup. Collins Brothers is 100% takeout so be sure you understand this before stopping by. Its a cozy place without tables and chairs so you will be eating this at home or in your car. And if you are curious about their daily special, it is posted on their website. Tl;DR: Not 5-star soup but still worth stopping by. Grab the bread too."}, {"review_id": "WGQSQw3fU_EqL04I_LxZTQ", "user_id": "FIKTMne1DsA3UsGQ1OoVwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2017", "text": "Easily  the best bowl of clam chowder I have eaten (and I have tried quite a few).  This little hole in the wall place next to a divey convenience store is an absolute gem.  A couple things to note.  First it is cash only.  Second there is only a single chair against a wall, so you won't be eating there.  That being said, I ate my chowder in the car and it was a great lunch.  It was smooth and not too heavy.  A lot of the chowders  that I have in New England are too doughy from the roux or too gritty.  This bowl had none of that.Thank you to Yelp reviewers for helping me to find this place.  I travel out of Massachusetts via MHT often and this will become my lunch stop every time."}, {"review_id": "mEwz_RSzp2tZ4U_LfDLRZg", "user_id": "eeT23DW9q5Zvlb4EyJPg7w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/6/2017", "text": "I have lived in Nashua for three years and I deeply regret not trying Collins Brothers sooner. I stopped here for my first time this weekend and it more than lived up to the hype. First of all, this is a counter deal. No seats here, and you don't need them. This is about convenience! Visit their website to find out the specials of the week. The shop offers different types of chowder on a regular basis (clam, corn and bacon, broccoli cheddar), a daily special soup, and packaged cold dinners for reheating. Every option is worth stopping for.On my first visit I ordered a pint of clam chowder, a quart of the daily soup, and a heat-and-serve shepherd's pie.The clam chowder is sincerely one of, if not the best, I have ever had. I was born in Massachusetts and raised on the beaches every summer here. I know chowder, and this is it. The broth is creamy but light, there are plenty of potatoes and other vegetables, and real clams. Not a single  harsh sandy bite to grit your teeth through. New Englanders, you know what I mean. Every chowder seems to have one, but not this place. I ate the pint for three lunches, and at $12 that was worth it and beyond.The daily soup was the Stuffed Pepper, and it was really a great chili variant. It was mostly ground beef, not too dry, with a healthy amount of chopped peppers, chunks of tomato, and rice. The broth was mildly spiced, tomato based, and just salted enough. If you're home, put cheese on it before microwaving. If not, don't worry about the cheese. It doesn't really need it, but I did put it on the second bowl I ate of this $6 pint, and it was amazing. This was a super heavy soup and lasted me two meals with a small salad on the side of the second. The hungry will get a lunch out of it.The shepherd's pie was a last minute buy for me because they were out of the week's chicken pot pie special. I don't blame them, I was there in the last 30 minutes of their service on a Saturday. Watch the hours here. They're not open long during the week because they don't have to be.  Back to the pie, it came in a little snap lid tupperware container that was microwave safe. It was perfect for throwing into a bag for lunch at work, and when I nuked it the next day it came out perfect. For $6 the portion was big, a layer of beef, corn, cheese and I assume some sort of savory gravy, all topped with at least an inch of mashed potatoes. The whole thing even had a sprinkle of parsley and maybe paprika? It was a perfect lunch portion. I'm considering stopping here for my work week's worth of meals, it was so convenient.I predictably forgot they were cash only when I got there, but the owner was super nice about it. They mentioned an ATM next door, and when I came back quickly with cash (remember, I was there a half hour before they closed) one of the women working the counter was kind enough to throw in one of the deserts they sell to offset my ATM costs. It was some kind of peanut butter, nut-topped brownie that usually sold for $2, which I craved more of immediately after finishing.Seriously, check their website. You'll plan buying way too much food before you even get there."}, {"review_id": "hcNUUpko1xOtvOuQlzjkCQ", "user_id": "cVss8T94R_Wlbqsi6jMBjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/4/2017", "text": "Best soup around!

I'm kind of shocked none of the other reviews mentioned that this is CARRY OUT only. I walked in expecting a table (I admit I didn't read all the reviews) and was met by a line. It was small, so not a big deal.  I kept looking for a menu for something other than chowder or soup as many reviews talked about the lobster rolls. When I asked, apparently they won't have lobster rolls until the spring (is that when fresh lobster is in season?). Fine. I'd rather not have canned lobster if a place is committing to only serve fresh, in season food. So I got a pint of clam chowder: thick, creamy, chunks of tender clams, perfectly cooked potato pieces...  Probably the best clam chowder I've ever had. I also picked up a shepherds pie. They have a cooler with pot pies, pot roast dinners, shepherds pie, etc. My shepherds pie seemed homemade and freshFriendly staff; quick and efficient service.

I am PRETTY obnoxious about being born and raised in the greatest city in the world, NYC. So I let that little detail linger on in my reviews of restaurants because I have pretty high standards when it comes to food. But let it be known that, I am temporarily living in New Hampshire for a year-long internship, so I have set my high standards aside to see how the local people of NH do it. Well, here goes one of my first five-star reviews for the granite state! Thank you Collins for showing me what a REAL New England Clam Chowder is. The chowder had HUGE chunks of clam, was super creamy, and the veggies in it had just the right amount of texture in such a creamy soup. I was in and out of there quick even though it was around lunchtime when I arrived. I paid less than $7 for a pint-sized chowder with a mini warm baguette. Service was incredibly friendly, and the owner made it a point to call me my name (was wearing a name tag)! Highly recommend. Hope to come back and try their other soups/stews!"}, {"review_id": "kNOs_qZ34BIP3HHkTjp1bw", "user_id": "S7iJ9oeE0xSaYuSai8OfNw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2016", "text": "This place has seriously great chowder and soup.

It's better than the Pearl Oyster Bar in NYC. The lobster was seasoned just right and was really soft and not overcooked. We liked the clam chowder a lot but LOVED the Seafood Nantucket. There were big chunks of fish. We were bummed that there was no seating in that place and we ended up eating in the car. Nevertheless, we were happy that we got a chance to try it!
