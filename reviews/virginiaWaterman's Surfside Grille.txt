Our waitress was super friendly, especially after I spilled my drink. The calamari was above average with pickled peppers on the side with a delicious dipping sauce. All three of us had meals that we loved. The summer chicken salad was awesome with just the right amount of mangos, cheese, and chicken. The shrimp and scallop pasta had a smoky and tangy sauce that worked perfectly with the seafood. The salmon salad was cooked to perfection and we didn't leave anything on the table. The seating was all very comfortable and though the restaurant is large, it didn't feel overly crowded. For larger parties, there's a big round table with a Lazy Susan in the center. It's cool that this spot is right on the beach...I wish we went while the sun was setting so that we could see the sun set. All tables have a great view of the horizon!"}, {"review_id": "NYXAshjCR14IwAH182OCNA", "user_id": "RrlDKdyVEhB58DtxOtZ8lQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "Came here for lunch for the first time! I'm from out of town and it was directly across from our hotel. My party and I sat on the outside patio. Great views of the ocean!! Drinks: You must get the orange crush if you're visiting Va beach and come here!! It's so refreshing and delicious! Food: We ordered the crab dip as an appetizer and a pound of shrimp to share. The crab dip is to die for!! The chips were nice and crispy, perfect for dipping. The shrimp was steamed and seasoned well. For my entree, I ordered the blacked tuna tacos. They were a little salty but overall really good! It came with a cold rice and black bean mix, which I thought was kind of strange because I was thinking it was going to be hot. So I wasn't a fan of that side dish. Overall, I would definitely come back for the food, drinks and views!"}, {"review_id": "GuTfC9Ub3VhKSFUFF8fAEA", "user_id": "1e_oBTwx4ToVpGmaTJqFuA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Wonderful. Great food. Awesome drinks. Kid friendly. Kim is the best! Attentive, friendly and professional- great recommendations- if Kim says it is good then it is amazing! We dined here two nights in a row we had such a great time. We would have made it a third, but our vacation had come to an end. The crab dip, steamed shrimp, fish tacos and buffalo bites were awesome. The kids menu was not just fried food! And have a crush or a margarita- the fresh juice and crushed ice make all the difference.  Waterman's- I can't wait to come back!

Let me start by saying everyone from the hostess, the person who took us to our table, down to the waitress, Gabbi, were the absolute nicest and seem to really value their customers. The food was a tad on the pricier side, but oh so good (I could have eaten every crab they had in there and everything we ordered was delish), but the gorgeous ambience of being on the water completely makes up for it. I absolutely can't wait to go back.PS- the MANmosa is a must try!"}, {"review_id": "T0zRRsntQ7BnFnw5bV1eZg", "user_id": "PmPomRc8p_918r5tVoh5Rw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Waterman's was a great location to see the Atlantic Ocean for the first time!

I feel that the service is either good and the food is good, the service is Really good, the food is Really good, or, the food and service is terrible! On my last visit it was unfortunately the latter...my sister was missing her ear of corn in her seafood basket, and all of our seafood was overcooked, I was not happy with my order of my crabcakes. Lots of filler...! They looked little dark brown golf balls. That's not how a fresh crab cake should look like! And they tasted like what they looked like...dark and filled with lots of mysterious filler. It is definitely disappointing when you are craving crab, and are given breadcrumbs.

The Original is a fresh squeezed  orange with orange vodka, triple sec and Sprite which is delicious! I've also had the Spring Fever Crush (absolut vodka,  St German elderflower liqueur,  fresh squeezed grapefruit and lime juice with soda water) which was very good and not as sweet but very tasty!  The creamsicle crush is great too - fresh squeezed orange juice, Pinnacle whipped vodka, triple sec and a splash of Sprite.  I really enjoyed the bird dog crush which is fresh orange juice, bird dog peach whiskey and a splash of ginger ale which was refreshing and delicious too! All in all, I don't think you can go wrong with any crush of your choice and they have a lot to choose from!For the food, I had the crabbed stuffed flounder with parmesan peppercorn sauce which was absolutely delicious with veggies and rice pilaf.  There isn't any breading on the crab either, so I felt a little \"healthier\" too!  My husband got the Ultimate Just Seafood which has a 6 oz. Cold water lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, sea scallops, lump crabmeat broiled in a lemon butter with white wine sauce served with mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables.  There was no breading either on this which was what he preferred.  He thought this  dish was good but enjoyed mine better.  I also had the key lime pie for dessert which is the owner's grandma's recipe which was great!The ice cream sandwich was also really good too!We had a great time at this restaurant and Terrell, our waiter, was awesome!  He was friendly, personable and provided great service!  This place also provides a military discount too!

For my meal I ordered the just seafood which consist of lump crab, scallops, and shrimp with whipped potatoes and seasoned veggies. The seafood was in a plate of butter, white wine, and old bay seasoning. It was great and really made the seafood shine.  I would for sure come back again.

Portions for these were pretty small, so you'd be getting a better deal if you bought these during happy hour, as opposed to full priced at $9, which I made the mistake of doing :(The location and views are phenomenal!

It's where it gets too crowded but you do get a DJ. If you want a more chill atmosphere, go downstairs. There's more seating, all the water views, and most importantly, the ring toss game.
