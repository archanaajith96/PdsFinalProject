Drink menu- above avg. coquito??! Nice. Menu prices reflect both of these things.That being said, I find the service lacking here for what you'd expect to get. On more than one occasion there isn't a check back when one was needed (undercooked food once). Today I brought a company lunch of 5 here and the service was lethargic in a 1/4 full restaurant. 8 mins at front desk waiting for host as 3 other parties came up and waited for various reasons. Then seated, 10 mins to server greeting and water. I almost flagged down anyone at one point. After that, 10 more until the server Richard brought bread which we didn't even expect at that point. Nothing exceptional, teetering on sub par.I keep coming back - they do occasionally have a John Dory special I will get 100% of the time. I think going forward I would rethink options. It's too expensive for mediocre experience to be honest."}, {"review_id": "51PQBF6m8xOiMlJlcag5rw", "user_id": "qYt9TrapRnoCEFWshc_UTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/9/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Nice place. Food was good. Went here for a work dinner and got the surf and turf. Only downside was the beef portion was 5 ounce (and it isn't disclosed on the specials menu). Service was decent, place was peaceful, and the food was well seasoned. If you happen to be in the area, this place is great for a business lunch, but it wasn't distinctive enough to recommend going out of your way for ."}, {"review_id": "GSmN5xx5OIoPZCOC03B9gQ", "user_id": "w2d07xCG3pYfAvI5Ni4jgQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "I stopped there yesterday after a trip to the Basketball Hall of Fame.

We were at our son's hockey tournament and stopped at Max's for dinner. It's in a strip mall so we expected a pub/burger joint but instead had a first-class steakhouse experience. Living in Boston, our standards for service, experience and food are high and Max's was right up there with the places we love in the city. The food was delish - steaks cooked perfectly. And Mark and Sarah (I think those were their names) took great care of us. They also had a stellar wine list of some amazing wines at all prices and we had a fantastic dinner. After hanging out at a hockey rink all weekend, Max's was a delight. Highly recommend!"}, {"review_id": "RPzp9J4OOFZjx8TR-wua2A", "user_id": "YGBhHN84Mo7cHWjqZx7ipg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/16/2017", "text": "Cool looking restaurant with outdoor seating bar seating and dining room seating. Menus are a little confusing. Same items on the 2 menus are priced different. Not sure why. I tried the pulled pork soup. It was a spicy BBQ pork stew. It was not great. The cheeseburger sliders were ok. The Caesar salad was good. The meatloaf with cheddar mashed was ok. The potatoes were good the meatloaf lost something with addition of a sauce that I can't place. It took away from the true taste of the meatloaf. Overall I thought the menu was expensive for what it was. $8 soup. $13 sliders. The meatloaf was reasonable at $17Some of the other items seemed ridiculously overpriced."}, {"review_id": "7OhDbDtWbvDTbdmnq_XoCQ", "user_id": "YWRBXUMM52yAVvSnJXdeBw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/28/2016", "text": "Great place by the Basketball Hall of Fame.

Upon arriving we were directed to the room the presentation was being held in and almost immediately asked what we would like for drinks.  Thanks to our hosts, we were not limited as to what we could order in terms of beverages.  A waitress brought me a drink menu which had more options than I've seen anywhere else... this of course lead me into a quandary of what I should order. While she was taking care of other guests, a waiter inquired if he could help, and made some recommendations according to my tastes.  Ultimately he ended up slightly customizing one of their regular beverages to make it the absolutely perfect fit!We had a limited dining menu to choose from, but the quality of each selection was phenomenal. I ended up going with the Atlantic Salmon a la Plancha.  Great serving size and the way the flavors of the salmon's accompaniments played together was like heaven.  Although none of my coworkers were kind enough to share a piece of their  Grilled New York Strip with me (greedy bastards!) they would absolutely not stop going on about what a big piece it was and how delicious!Finally for desset... we had the options of Cheesecake with raspberry coulis, or the Tavern Chocolate Cake.  This time I was fortunate to get both as one of my coworkers isn't a big dessert guy.  The Cheesecake was one of the best I've ever had; the last time I enjoyed Cheesecake this much was when I was in Spain.  It didn't have that overly sweet quality that has often plagued other cheesecakes I've tried. It definitely trumped the Chocolate Cake in my opinion, which  (and I never thought I'd say this!) was just a tad too chocolatey.  The group will back me up on this one.  I'm definitely hoping to make it back sometime to get a taste of more of the menu!"}, {"review_id": "Bh6Im_FcAYJZijiMlcOUqg", "user_id": "X0BSXazrdySnTkiVIGQ7yA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/5/2017", "text": "Excellent dining experience.

I was wrong. Let's start with the service - The only good part was that we were out the door in less than an hour which gave us time to get some ice cream from next door and catch a movie. Apart from that, The waiter looked less than interested in serving us or making sure that we enjoyed our meal. He didn't even ask if the steak was cooked to my liking. He never brought the bread out. Did not ask if I needed sugar with my iced tea and did not even bring it out. I finally spotted him at the end of my meal and was short of raising my hand or screaming \"excuse me\" to get his attention when we finally made eye contact.  That is when I got sugar for my tea. Our appetizer plates were not cleared when our main course was brought out. They actually sat on our table along with the serving platter until the end of our meal. We pretty much did not see our server from the minute he put the food down till I flagged him for sugar. We still tipped him 20% giving him the benefit of doubt that he may be having a bad night.  Now the food - there was no bread so can't comment on that. We ordered calamari for appetizer. It was decent. I ordered an Oscar filet mignon. The steak itself was cooked ok. However, the mashed potato was cold and runny. The asparagus was soggy and limp. And I could hardly taste the crab cake. Bernaise sauce was not anything to write home about either. I could have just ordered the steak without the extra stuff and been happier with a cheaper meal. (The mashed potato would have still thrown me off though). My husband ordered the half roasted chicken. Again the chicken itself was awesome. However, everything else on the plate (including the sauce) was cold and a disappointment. At this point, I just figured that I would not be wowed by the dessert either so we decided to hop over to Cold Stone next door which actually made my night."}, {"review_id": "pzwqhlIwjzUnk-i-7cltOQ", "user_id": "KRQS2WqDcd8pMo_Y8tklAQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/15/2017", "text": "Two stars because our server, Jess, was awesome. Everything else was disappointing. Two of us ordered dinner. Calamari was greasy and nothing special, Martha's Vineyard Oysters were good. Strip Streak with 'loaded' baked potato for a side looked like something served at a diner. Steak was chalky and potato was cold. Double cut pork chop with BBQ Hoisin sauce was just ok. Chop was moist, but BBQ sauce just tasted like Hoisin and nothing else. Coconut sticky rice served underneath didn't leave a trace of coconut flavor. The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired- dark, and sports bar-like, loud rock music playing. Way overpriced for what you get.

My steak came out promptly and was DELICIOUS juices flowing onto the plate cooked per my request and my baked potato well it was a potato not much to say about that. The calamari is spicy but yummy!

It's worth noting that Happy Hour is Mon-Sat: 4-6pm and Sun 2-6pm at the bar only. That didn't stop us from annihilating some app-ies though:Victims:- Korean BBQ Ribs, tasty saucing but chewy. The kimchi zucchini and summer squash had a bit too much fish sauce- Crispy Rhode Island Calamari with garlic butter and hot cherry peppers spicy marinara was good. Tender pieces of squid in a light, crispy batter, equal parts meat and tentacles- Yellowfin Tuna Tacos were interesting. The \"wrap\" was a crispy wonton and it was filled with sushi rice and wasabi cream. The tuna was fresh but the unique taco might not settle with everyone.- Hall of Fame Garlic Bread with gorgonzola fondue was very tasty but the dish is heavy. - Onion, garlic, mozzarella flatbread was ok but small to share. Service was polite and friendly and our seasonal cocktails were good. It's a Max restaurant so pricing leans on the higher side."}, {"review_id": "H-kTHajfApgSsd2pg5Qsaw", "user_id": "irRf6uIxbiDt5f7JC70CRg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/8/2016", "text": "I strolled in life with a friend around 9:45pm to have something light to eat and a few drinks. We head straight to the bar where 2 seats were unoccupied at the edge of the bar and one seat in the very corner of the bar leading toward the other 3 seats against the wall. I asked the 4 women who were huddled in the corner if anyone was sitting in these seats and they ignored me, so I sat down (leaving one seat in between us). It seemed everyone at Max's was still dressed as if they just stepped out of the office, still in work clothes. Long peacoats, dress shirts, and fake neck pieces around women's necks; meanwhile my friend and I in jeans and a hoodie, maybe that's why we were getting the side eye, we weren't dressed to the standards of the bourgeois there.As we order our drinks my friend nudges me as one of the women in the group in the corner suddenly grabs the purse that was hanging on the chair nearest to us and puts it on the other side of them. I'm thinking to myself... well that purse was hanging there before we arrived, with a full bar area full of people...how hilarious all of a sudden they decide to move it. They were annoying and intoxicated I could hear it in their tone as they were conversing. One claimed she may be having an allergic reaction and her husband (who happened to be a police officer) came quickly. This group was utterly annoying, riding their high horse. If anything it was them who annoyed us throughout the night. But I've visited this venue before and this is the type of clientele they cater to primarily; people with their noses in the air. I ordered a small serving of steak from their late night menu to go with my beers. The steak was cooked perfectly (somewhat salty), but the quality of the meat was mediocre. The beer was beer, Stella, nothing special about it. The bartender was overall attentive, she did step away a few times for longer than expected periods, so we did wait for second drinks. I am unsure if she was catering to the tables in the bar area as well, perhaps that is why. Either way, as a bar manager myself, a bartender should always be behind the bar. She was nice, nothing out of the ordinary. In previous visits, the food is a bit pricey off of the regular menu. The portions small, but the flavor divine. It is neat, clean, well kept, and overall a decent place to dine.UPDATE 4/25/18One of the women in the party had the nerve to send me a private message telling me my review should've been about the restaurant not the guests. The nerve of this bitch. Because of their novice drinking and behavior they became a nuisance to others around them; how hard is that to understand? Still drunk?"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/maxs-tavern-springfield-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
