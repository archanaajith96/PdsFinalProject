I made a 10AM reservation for a party of 16 and we were seated promptly. Only 8 of us showed up so we were able to all fit at one table. Buffet options included scrambled eggs, frittata, potatoes, bacon, sausage, brioche French toast, waffles, and chicken piccata. There is a ham/prime rib carving station, along with pasta and omelette stations. There is also salad, salmon, and your traditional bagels, muffins, and croissants. Dessert options weren't too interesting to me. Everything taste alright (the pasta was my favorite part), but our service was exceptional. Once it hit 11AM, it really started to get crowded. After two hours (as we were waiting for the check) we were notified that we should leave, as another party was waiting for our table. Overall, this is a great brunch option for groups and a nice experience."}, {"review_id": "OhgNTwSmZDOKCI2YHP5LZw", "user_id": "4ud2jB1N8_8iTXcp2660KA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "This place has a whole lot of character and certainly can be a great place to visit if you're looking to impress someone with an environment that feels high class. The building is filled with perfect high class decor, has an amazing porch that opens up during warm weather.Unfortunately all of this comes with a price tag and the food quality doesn't completely match up! The food is certainly a tad above average but doesn't bring any of the wow factor I usually look for in a four or five star restaurant. I would say the meals here are of a four star quality but come with a five star bill.That being said the atmosphere and fried my staff are spot on and you could really impress people by bringing them here, if those things are important. I certainly wouldn't discourage people from trying this place, but if you're looking for good food at a reasonable price you may check elsewhere...Might be worth the money for special occasions if the atmosphere is your main concern though!"}, {"review_id": "dxappAVAWcTF1_xE1TnVDQ", "user_id": "twt2cniWvC-VYU_Jn1QcxA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Planned a surprise anniversary dinner for my parents 40th anniversary! This was most of the party's first time coming here besides two who raved about it. We were immediately greeted by our friendly server. I got a red sangria, others got lemonade and beer. For appetizers we started with the pizza and classic calamari! The calamari was okay but definitely not the best I have had. For entrees a few got the fettuccine and beef tenderloin, vodka pasta with chicken, and I got the lemon risotto with scallops. The entree was okay but nothing spectacular. And considering the place was pretty pricy I don't think it was really worth the place besides the great company. Our server was super friendly and nice. They did have a nice bar with some music being played so maybe it would be a good place to grab a appetizer and a drink."}, {"review_id": "fzc9ADHXLq9gYQgk9LNMaw", "user_id": "OdLmWDnb1Cl8ugqFsZAGlw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "This place has a really nice bar, but was incredibly packed when we arrived at 5pm.  The bar was completely empty by the time we were through with dinner (7:30ish), so it seems to be an after work destination.  The dining room was a bit formal for me.  It was nicely appointed, but I felt like a strip mall restaurant may not need to be set up the way it is.  The food was just ok.  We ordered a number of appetizers and I had been to too many customer dinners, so I went with chicken instead of steak.  The chicken, again, was just ok.  The prices for the entrees are similar if not more expensive than what I'm accustomed to downtown Providence.  Next time I will recommend that we head back to Providence for dinner, but if you find yourself in the area I would recommend a stop in at the bar.  The employees are very attentive and polite as well!"}, {"review_id": "pfwu1WlySEZTpSfwWXZ0bQ", "user_id": "ho22Qpj5YlGqQl5e5xZ5Yg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "Love this restaurant.

Everything was lovely from the ambiance, food and our server. We sat in the room which can be converted into a patio come the warmer months.  It was great to enjoy the sunshine along with great food and company. The pasta station was scrumptious as well as the carving station and desserts. Pink vodka sauce was amazing. Their prime rib was perfectly cooked and complimented by a horse radish sauce which was very tasty. I also enjoyed the other extras such as the bacon, sausage, potatoes, and cesar salad. Great experience! Would absolutely go back."}, {"review_id": "ia2xr7H4_xClzfi2Moe47A", "user_id": "i6Pb1_iIEI4tC8hHh4FQew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Came for a Sunday brunch and it's totally worth it! I came with a big party of 12 for a friend's birthday party. I was a bit hesitant about the price but for an extra $10 we got all you can drink bloody Mary's, mimosas and sangrias. They have all of your basic breakfast items done really well and then a prime rib/ham carving station, pasta station, omelette station and dessert bar. I really enjoyed the home fries and frittata as well as the prime rib. It was served with au jus and a horse radish sauce. It was tender and moist, slight too red for some but perfect for me. I had a pink vodka pasta with Parmesan cheese, mushrooms, spinach and shrimp. My favorite dessert was the cheesecake truffle. I was too stuffed but had to go back and get another one of those. The service and scenery is really nice.

I made reservations on opentable for 1130 and  he reservations were confirmed. I show up and the doors are locked. I try to go on their website to check the opening times and the website is completely down. Great, now I can't even look at the menu while I'm in the car waiting for some sign of life in the restaurant. Finally at 11:40 we call and ask when they're open, they say now, and I tell them well the door isn't unlocked. So they come and open to door, no apology no anything. I'm s find I just waited in the cold wind at an upperclass establishment with reservations. Best part, she didn't even unlock the door after us and I personally had to open the door for the next party. Still no apology!We were finally seated by 11:45 to which they did not immediately great us at our table. We are 15 mins late for our reservation because you didn't unlock your door and you expect me to wait even longer!!!!! The nerve. I was so frustrated I just got my coat and left.I've never been treated so badly in this restaurant. I always have it in my mind for all special events and classy affairs and I'm just shocked at how poorly run this was run today I don't even know if I'll bother going back."}, {"review_id": "ONSXc6hrzfpGaajQjvM0ww", "user_id": "88qtmMVPY-hX9lqaBW22Bw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "Food was 3 stars but the service was 5 stars across the board - hence the 4 star rating. The place is beautiful and so stunning, that alone was part of the reason why we came here for my brother's 30th. Reservations were very easy via Opentable and we requested a intimate table and a dessert/candle after dinner. Let me tell you, boy they sure did deliver. Overall, the food was just ok. Nothing too spectacular but sufficient. My salmon was cooked nicely but was a bit bland and there was way too many lentils on the plate. Just ok was the consensus across the table. But again where this place really shines was the service. Our waitress was amazingly attentive and they brought out dessert and a candle as we had requested - they even paid attention to it being his 30th so A+ for that Chapel Grille!I would definitely come back here maybe not for dinner but for drinks and apps at the bar. The place is really chic but I would just say the entertainment can be a bit distracting."}, {"review_id": "CBESrjN32pQcpTiSaCSsUQ", "user_id": "MPAM1lBWOKqfPOVrab40GA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/7/2017", "text": "This restaurant was awesome all around. The outside is decorated with lights year round which get turned on once the sun starts going down, as well as seasonal flowers. The mums in the Fall are gorgeous! It was pretty busy inside on a Friday night but not overcrowded. We had a reservation and it looked like a lot of people around us did also but there was no one ever waiting too long to be seated. Our waiter was extremely observant and made sure we were completely satisfied the entire time. I could tell he really liked the restaurant himself. We were surprised to find out that they have date-night Fridays. They have a special fixed menu where you get to pick an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert for just $50. You can even add a bottle of wine to that for an extra $15. The waiter told us they have this deal year round but the options on the fixed menu are always changing. We split the margherita pizza for an appetizer and for my entree I got the salmon dish. The salmon came with veggies and lentils. My boyfriend got the steak frites which was good too. We added a bottle of Pinot noir to the deal and enjoyed the pumpkin creme brûlée for dessert. Everything was excellent - but that mascarpone that came with the dessert had to be my favorite."}, {"review_id": "K6jH8kR632Lt3ma4Mu9DPg", "user_id": "TwgQb6iTLcBSs4hzErTRag", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/13/2017", "text": "We came here for lunch one day to experience this cool historic building. It was a chapel back in the day and built in 1891. It's on the hill so it has nice views; there's also a terrace. The service was good; it's definitely fancy in there. Loved the dimly lit ambiance so it's a perfect place for a romantic date. I ordered the Linguine and Clams; which had littleneck clams, white wine, garlic, crushed red pepper, basil, and olive oil. The food was pretty good definitely on the expensive side. I would definitely come here during special occasions or lunch time when entrees are cheaper. I heard the brunch is good there; I have yet to check that out but next time I'm looking forward to doing so. It's definitely a place to check out at least once and I recommend it!"}, {"review_id": "CF0JU6YjURqYfMndt1Faxw", "user_id": "QAMUxsZ0-atYwfzpKu7hXg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Chapel grille does not reflect a 3.5 star experience and that rating doesn't seem to reflect reviews over the last 1-2 years either... not sure how Yelp's analytics work but this doesn't seem fair.

Food was a solid 4 stars (only complaint was the Charcuterie Board had what appeared to be sliced deli-salami which could have easily been replaced with some soppressata).

It's a really old church (built in 1891). The grounds are landscaped beautifully as well. We had never been and reviews are so so. We decided to give it a try during Providence Restaurant Week since it was reasonably priced $34.99 for a 3 course meal.We had 7:00 reservations on a Tuesday and were seated promptly. Our waitress Danielle was very nice and attentive. Our glasses never were empty. We both opted for the shrimp and coconut orachini (basically risotto balls with a tasty twist). We really enjoyed them. They were spicy sweet morsels. I had the stuffed sole with roasted parsley potatoes. My husband had the beef tenderloin tips with smashed potatoes and green beans. The tenderloins were supposedly cooked medium but some were like beef jerky. Definitely overcooked but still okay. The smashed potatoes looked like a pile of vomit. They were overwhipped and very glutinous. The spice in them was overwhelming (rosemary????). They were gross. Danielle was great and brought him roasted parsley potatoes instead. We shared Mango cheesecake and Coffee Creme Brulee. I liked the mango cheesecake better. I prefer a traditional Creme Brulee but it wasn't bad.Last but not least...I'm a doof and left my keys on a chair. I called as soon as I got home and noticed (husband drove my car and house keys were separate). They had them at the hostess station and held them for me to pick up the next day. Overall it's a nice place with nice people."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/chapel-grille-cranston-2?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
