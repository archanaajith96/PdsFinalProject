Being I was on a work dining per diem I over ordered going with a 1/2 lb burger, french fries and cheese curds.  After ordering and then seeing other trays coming out I realized I was going to get more than my hungry eyes were going to be able to handle. I really only wanted just a few cheese curds, but of course you can't order just a couple.When my order came out I was only given my burger and fries.  I didn't complain, because I immediately noted what I had been given was all I really was going to be able to comfortably handle anyway.  Three quarters of the way through my burger/fries they recognized the cheese curd omission and out they came.  The server was quickly apologetic and seeing I was almost done with my burger, comped the curds.Very good burger, fries and yes cheese curds.  Friendly service, even through a minor snafu that I wasn't going to call them on anyway.  The place is a definite dive but in that good kind of way."}, {"review_id": "XJTaoMc4RlAVDDgf6z7o8A", "user_id": "o_Ulw-xdw-skOC1Vlni1NA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/25/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Head out to Green Bay for another example of what a burger should be. No preformed frozen patties, no big honking huge mound of beef, just a 1/4 lb of ground on site, tasty beef. Limited accoutrements on the classic burger allow every part to stand on its own.Grilled onions, pickles and mustard all work together to create a symphony of flavor. Add cheese if you like, it's only .50 more. Served properly on a Sheboygan hard roll from Johnston's Bakery.Added kudos for offering my favorite side, the simple tater tot. Offering more crunch per square inch than any of its potato competitors.  Salty crevices of goodness, just begging to be dipped in catsup. (Or ketchup if you prefer, fancy boy)Meals are offered on a large cookie sheet, so you have plenty of room for the destruction to come.Was it worth the calories? -Absolutely!"}, {"review_id": "E5rAKtYT8V7lpwKaMG85aw", "user_id": "SKAjhodYMhoZPWugSHE_9w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "I was looking for a place to get a good greasy diner burger. I have definitely found it at Al's. I ordered the double cheeseburger with fried onions and a side of cheese curds. The meal came with a side of ranch dressing at no extra cost. The food was what you would expect. Hot and greasy right off the griddle. It has that hole in the wall vibe with a few regulars sitting in the corner.

It's a great story with a former employee for the original Al taking ownership and re-doing the entire restaurant. There is a negative review from some tool from MN-don't listen to him. He's from MN.

They are also noticeably less greasy which is a plus. The location is really clean now and the staff is super friendly. My experience: I ordered the classic burger with fried onions. It came with pickles and I added American cheese. It was served on a toasted bun. I added some ketchup and mustard from the counter. It was a 10/10 for a burger. I loved it. The fried onions that were cooked with the patty really set this burger up as a win. For the side I picked the hay stack onions and the waitress even offered me some spicy sauce to go with them. YUM! I also stole some fries from my husbands order. Those are hand cut delights. Stop in you will not be let down at all. For $13 for two to eat you HAVE to stop in!"}, {"review_id": "Twvt1PYR4mW2C61QeYW7KQ", "user_id": "qgoB9O0YFWJ3SBYBzkHO-w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "It's has such a cute diner fell almost like you stepped into the past.

We were expecting a packed house but the place was pretty empty on this day. We sat at the counter and were greeted by the friendly waitress. She set us up with drinks right away and our order was in. I went with the classic mushroom swiss and could not have been happier. Just as described and the tater tots were hot and crispy. The lunch partner went with a Fiesta burger off the specialty menu. He said it was good but the chorizo was too over powering. Within 24 hours he was pulled over for speeding on his way to eat some left over sloppy joes so is he really one to judge? Conclusion is stop in at Al's for the classic burger at a great price."}, {"review_id": "ItkouSwP7ynQy8Wo4pjKUg", "user_id": "bB7T9oDneUwdojM-XmFPCQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/12/2017", "text": "Same place, but different experience from the old Al's.....Menu is much more condensed, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and most of the favorite selections are the same. I tried the new specialty breakfast burger. Comes with Gouda, egg, candied bacon, Bloody Mary ketchup on a brioche bun. I added the famous Al's fried onions as well and a side of fries.Burger had good taste. Disappointed in the \"Bloody Mary ketchup\" as I couldn't even taste it. The candied bacon was excellent. Kind of greasy (as expected at Al's) but the bun wouldn't hold all that egg/burger moisture and fell apart. If it had been toasted or on a different bun that held together better it would have been excellent.  Was thankful I added the tasty onions. The fries are new/different and weren't good at all. Thick cut and soggy. Bland. In the old Al's, the waitstaff were very inviting and friendly, almost what you expect in a small diner setting. The staff during my visit were kind of cold and primarily engaged in the interaction between themselves. Would be like a bartender being on the phone. Some people probably prefer this, but the regular customers familiar with this place for the longest time would be turned away...and it's apparent, since it was empty on a Sunday at 11. I'd return, as their food still stands up to the name, (minus the fries), and brings back a lot of good memories."}, {"review_id": "6czLSFddjrhajAQwXtBYrw", "user_id": "NbZSUZf4tlcME9wd4Ree5w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "If you want a burger, stop reading this and go there.

Walk 2 more blocks and you're at Titletown Brewery, which not only HAS AVAILABLE PARKING but also treats you like a human being, has a great selection of brewed adult beverages and serves burgers that have the added benefit of tasting good.
