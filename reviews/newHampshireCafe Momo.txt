The place is kind of small. A very hometown small mountain town feel.  The lamb Momo and veggie Momo were delicious.The Gudruk soup was the best I ever had.We had the brown guy and the salmon over asparagus dinners. Both were absolutely delicious and healthy.  For something different and extraordinary on your palate you have to try this place."}, {"review_id": "WgtFzPFm1m9OUCOH30-Qxg", "user_id": "Dg1F6fjB0-_lAfmatJ21fQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "First time trying Himalayan food. I tried the chicken and veggie Momo as appetizer. Both were very good ! Basically was like dim sum in my opinion. For entree we ordered the chicken and mutter paneer curry dishes. Both had a lot of veggies and scoop of rice with a cilantro sauce. I got mild spice but basically tasted zero spiciness! Serving portion was good enough to share for 4 ppl between two dishes. I also tried the flat herbal bread but just tasted like a toasted bread- Probably wouldn't recommend unless you are accompanying with a spicier dish. Overall service - waiter was super attentive and nice. Was interesting to try Himalayan food overall - seems almost like Indian / east Asian cuisine."}, {"review_id": "ki_noclh0XbNSgCoq3pHmg", "user_id": "RUhm402Knd9QDk7Yk1VbaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Awesome restaurant! It's small, but it's very nice and peaceful on the inside. The food is delicious and really different from what you usually get. I noticed that the menu has a lot of meat and ingredients that are unusual, like plantains, wild boar, and goat. There are many kinds of momo and they are amazing! I would definitely come again."}, {"review_id": "QQgJQJ40F4ZryuUfZDl7ww", "user_id": "66aQlAX0nWEdJRks53pa-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/25/2016", "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Manchester.The food here is really authentic and everything I've tried has been delicious-definitely have some momo's but if this is your first time having nepalese food and you're feeling skittish have rama's chicken!Great for date nights and for intimate dinner with friends : ) and service is great!I've been coming here for years and this is really is a hidden gem not just in Manchester but in the whole northeast."}, {"review_id": "eX2g7McsC8wKEYmFSJhDnQ", "user_id": "GSMBpnEny1cR12yPIwO0Dg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/5/2016", "text": "One of the best meals I have ever had in my entire life.

We also wanted something different that we could not get in our hometown. Yelp to the rescue! There were so many things about the menu I would have liked to have tried, but we decided that the Momo Dumplings were the easiest for car consumption. There were lots of menus on the Internet with different dumpling flavors. Let me tell you, on this given day, there was: lamb, reindeer, buffalo, chicken, and veggie. (I only learned this once we got to the restaurant, and I could see the menu written on the wall.) The lamb momo were very good albeit a bit pricey. The flavoring was on point, and it had a little kick. The side sauce went really nicely with the momo.I scarfed them down. So delicious and hit the spot."}, {"review_id": "AU7woFlh598fqOkfqzI3_g", "user_id": "_Cbg4ufNcyfM3PZiyBIjDQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "This is the greatest restaurant I've ever eaten at! Everything tastes fresh, perfectly cooked, perfectly spiced. The atmosphere is intimate and comfortable, and the service is prompt but not rushed. If you're into spicy food, the servers give you a spicy scale of 1-10! (Also, I'd never had a strawberry lassi until I ate here, and it's delicious! It even has a little bit of cardamom.) I would eat at this restaurant every night if I didn't live so far away!! Really is my favorite restaurant of all time."}, {"review_id": "nsoVKp8c9jZi-e3j9dRBGA", "user_id": "vx4i26dxiUq9KYH8jNbiCA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/3/2017", "text": "Ordered Gundruk soup, noodles, Chicken and Goat Momos. Soup was very delicious and I would have given 5 ratings had the entire experience was great. Momo's crust was thick & size was too small. Goat meat inside the momo's was chewy not cooked/steamed well. Noodles very OK, but could have been better.

We started out with some veggie momos- sorta looks like shanghai soup dumpling but without the soup, and the flat herb bread which were very tasty.  As for the entree, we also picked out some stuff from the lunch specials (shrimp, veggie, fish, chicken dish with rice)- the sauces used in these dishes were very similar so it was hard to differentiate. The decor was nice- we had the entire half of the resturant to ourselves, haha"}, {"review_id": "EaqAx_8bopcZdpSutuO4uw", "user_id": "of3pyHtQ578WD2TaCqszJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2017", "text": "Our favorite place!!!

Paying as much as a high-end restaurants at $21 for their main lamb dish. The portion size was tiny and I only received 2 small lamb pieces that left me hungry afterwards and disappointed.If their prices were lower, I would bet that they would get much more repeat customers. At this price I'd prefer to go back to Cotton in downtown Manchester and get their stuffed lobster ravioli with their huge portion size."}, {"review_id": "wzcsRapK3lLFa6JM2Puf9g", "user_id": "kroQYWSj-BhIEXT4VwLRHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2013", "text": "Seriously....Nepalese food in Manchester...in a strip mall???Yep but it is a cool eccentric / eclectic  place. Try their various momos....think Chinese dumplings with various stuffing in them. I had the spinach paneer....but wish I could have gotten the wild boar.Food is not really hot even if you go to 10...I loved my lamb chili with rice...the lamb had a wonderful rich succulent taste...not too lambie...and was cooked to perfection. Vegetables were cooked wonderfully...crunchy and crisp...I believe they grow a lot of them ...or source them locally....they tasted amazing.Vegetarian choices abound. Wonderful warm service from the owner.
