The Food Market has some great dishes as well as drink selections. The atmosphere was casual elegant; you would see business suite attire, to funky flamboyant hair cuts to folks that seem to have come from a sporting event. The bar area appeared to be the main event for the night but the crowd wasn't too rowdy for the great tunes that enhanced the ambiance could still be heard so you can hum to.I had the very popular \"lil crab pot pie\" which was surprisingly well cheffed.  Most folks cannot handle a hand crafted pot pie from the freezer section but this was great and its elements; well seasoned too.  More crab meat would have been dope but hey I can wish, right?Next up was \"spicy, cheesy, creamy, herby, winey, garlicky shrimp\" which wasn't what I expected but more than I expected. The 4 larged sized shrimp soaked in cream and all the mentioned ingredients with torn pieces of bread definitely made my front turtle shell (my gut) smile from deep within.Lastly I ordered the \"bread & butter crusted seabass\" which also made me smile. Large cut of seabass sitting like a queen upon buttery mashed potatoes and peas with some type of delicate drizzle of goodness. Boy, it was cooked to perfection so light and fluffy, I couldn't believe I was eating fish. The only downfall the presentation, I literally said to the waiter \"hey I didn't order meatloaf\"."}, {"review_id": "oChcwvHm52f0MQNhlVGs3A", "user_id": "2qKoGWD1LCve6HnxStUgNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This review is for the brunch - definitely a hit for my group and me. I tried the avocado toast, truffle fries, and bison burger. Our table ordered soft pretzels with beer cheese to share. Avocado toast: thick toast with smoked salmon, half an avocado, and a perfectly seasoned poached egg on top. Definitely a lighter and fresher fare here, but still flavorful and hit the spot! Truffle fries: As a French fry aficionado, yum! Well cooked fries topped with cheese. Bison burger: two bison burger patties inside of your burger. To quote my (somewhat stoic) husband, \"that was really good, actually.\" The flavor winner of our table was the Beer Cheese that came with the appetizer of soft pretzels! We ate this up so quick that we didn't even have time for a photo. By the end of our meal, every plate was licked clean. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town!"}, {"review_id": "tzbKOzzobuoUgJ0pCPAWqw", "user_id": "7V1WSJXem-6r_NaFTofQVQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "I came here for brunch on a Sunday with a group of 3. We didn't have reservations but the bar area is first come first serve so we were able to sit right down and order food. They have a pretty big brunch menu- the prices are a little expensive, I got the open faced omelet that came on a salad and it was $15. This was a great brunch option since it had the breakfast element but also a refreshing salad. We ordered a side of breakfast potatoes- they were amazing! We didn't get drinks but being at the bar saw all the great brunch drinks and shots being made and they looked amazing! The inside is open and airy and the staff was friendly. I would recommend!"}, {"review_id": "hke3qSv__0Kox3fa9mV5Dw", "user_id": "N5YhEwTGdLnAE1RqK7BnFA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "We came here in happy hour time. price is cheaper but quality of food is nice !  I love the mussels especially the mussel with sausage and the cream sauce, tasty , love it.

It soaked up the olive oil quite well.Food Market has an eclectic menu that delivers comfort foods with high-end flair. Honestly, the menu has so many mouthwatering options on it to do this place justice you need to go a few times.With options like soft pretzels, pork belly, fried brie, and street tacos the small plates/appetizer menu alone is enough to warrant another trip back. The inner fat kid in me loves when high-end restaurants like Food Market take on simple classic comfort food dishes. Because it allows you to try your favorite comfort food prepared in the best way possible (hopefully).We started with the panko crusted brie and the pork belly. The brie itself is fried with panko and it's served with apples, bread, and a cherry jam. All of it worked well together as the acidity and sweetness of the apples balanced well with the cheese. But it's not really hard to screw up brie, at least let's hope not. The real star was the pork belly, this was cooked to perfection. The brown sugar glaze and the smokey flavor in the pork belly delivered a dish that made you crave more.The diverse dinner menu yielded a wide array of choices from our table. Beef Spare Rib, Soft Shell Crabs with Texas Toast, Steak Frites, Duck Breast, and Crab Cakes.Every single dish was cooked perfectly. The Beef Spare Rib which was served in a large crunchy tortilla bowl stole the show though. It was flavor yet tender, the pieces of meat would literally fall apart. The soft shell crabs were breaded and deep fried and served along with what appeared to look like savory french toast. It was delicious.The duck breast was cooked just right and it paired very well with the corn pudding. The corn pudding in all honesty was the star of the show, it had a creamy consistency with tiny chunks of fresh sweet corn along the way. The only real dud on this plate, was the spaetzle. Having had it in Germany during my travels I've come to expect it to be prepared a certain way and it just wasn't prepared the way I've always known it to be. This spaetzle was dry and chewy as opposed to the soft and delicate texture it usually has. I don't think the spaetzle was prepared poorly, I think it was just prepared in a different way, so I won't knock it too much.Lobster Mac & Cheese was on the menu and had to be tried, because well I have to try the house mac and cheese where ever I go. The mac and cheese left a little to be desired, I was hoping for more lobster and a more flavorful and creamy cheese sauce than what I received. That's not to say it wasn't good it just wasn't exactly what I had hoped.The crabcakes were excellent and were on par with any other fine crabcake establishment in Maryland. But in Maryland you become jaded well prepared crabcakes.The real star however was the dessert service. We basically ordered every dessert on the menu because #calories. Food Market creates desserts that satisfy your comfort food cravings in a way that you could never imagine. The heath bar bread pudding stole the show as it had the perfect salty and sweet flavor of heath bars melted into the flawlessly prepared bread pudding. Too often bread pudding is flavorless and dry, this was exactly the opposite. Get this when you go.The cheesecake was a handwhipped strawberry cheesecake that almost resembled a fruit parfait. The graham cracker crust was served on the top, with the strawberry filling and delicate cheese filling underneath. This was perfection. The cheese filling was delicate, flavorful, and moist meanwhile the strawberry filling had just the right balance of sweet and tangy. This is another must have when you go.The creme brulee was a well prepared creme brulee with a delicious mango custard. I always tend to avoid creme brulee because it's typically well prepared everywhere and I think most high-end places put it on the menu to satisfy those who feel every good restaurant should have it. Lastly, we tried the donut holes which were delicate little balls of happiness.The real stars were the bread pudding and cheesecake, when you go, order those and you will leave a very happy customer.Overall the Food Market delivers at every step of the way. The kind and friendly staff doesn't exude the typical pretentious hipster vibes you tend to experience when you go to a trendy restaurant. What I loved most was that the staff doesn't give you the life story of the protein you're being served, I don't care if the chicken was a lover of shakespeare and enjoyed long walks on the beach. I just want to know if it's tasty or not. Some of the farm to table places now love to go into finite detail of every ingredient on your plate."}, {"review_id": "QdI9prK9gscPLkT-WNVo9w", "user_id": "Xk1bqFYbe4kKZX_RnpsOdQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/14/2018", "text": "This was a dining experience !

Next we ordered entrees which were the swordfish and the crab cake sandwich with shrimp. We also ordered the potatoes with crab dip inside, truffle fries and one other thing I'm forgetting. That potato was amazing. I could not stop eating it! Dessert was good also. We had the brownies and the blondie! Overall this is now one of my favorite restaurants in Baltimore. Good vibes and food!

I safely rate my meal as a 4.5 - my dining companions even offered their 5s. The Food Market is a trendy space on the main Hampden avenue, chock a block full of local art, moody lighting, and quirky accents (peek the quasi-nonfunctional bookshelf above the open kitchen?). Parking in Hampden can be anywhere from cake to a headache, but I believe TFM offers a valet service. Luckily we nabbed a metered spot one block away ($1 for 2h). Service was attentive - probably the MOST efficient waiting/water service I've encountered in a long time. The same enthusiastic waiter served us the whole night, refilling our glasses if they were even an inch or two below full. I had to stop myself from chugging water, to save space for the feast that unfolded... The meal started off 'aight, but finished on a fabulous dessert crescendo. We began with the truffle parmesan fries ($8), which were somewhat of a disappointment. FYI: it's a SMALL order and would probably be best shared between 2 people rather than 4. In addition, you don't get any aioli or quirky dips -  just a cup of regular Heinz ketchup. Maybe I've been ruined by the duck fat fry experience at Salt (and my new garlic fry bae - Clark Burger), but I think truffle mayo is a much better condiment for fancy fries? Truffle is a very mellow, subtle flavour so when it's mixed with ketchup I find I can't really taste it at all. :/  However, we saw some folks a table over enjoying their Amish pretzels with a shot glass of pure cheese. I was consumed with envy. Next time, TFM. The RW first plates were small but lovely. I had the molasses flapjacks with duck scrapple and ginger butter. You get two palm-sized pancakes - which are surprisingly dense - and a crumble of scrapple. Between the molasses and ginger butter, the whole dish is delightfully gingerbready. The scrapple sadly didn't leave too much of an impression. Admittedly this was my first scrapple experience, but it's more dry and breadcrumby than a meat hash. I tried a spoonful or two of my friend's lobster butter (grits, raw sugar, black truffle) and was in love with the creamy, polenta-esque base. Things picked up from mains on out - I got the roast perch (A WHOLE FISH!) on a bed of mushroom wild rice with cranberries, almonds, and melted Meyer lemon butter. This would easily be a $40+ plate at many other equally-bougie restaurants. It was a shocker going from the diminutive sides and starters to the main; I think they give you a full regular-menu sized main(?) The perch was crispy and smoky, with light, flaky meat underneath. PSA: bones were kept in, so go slowly with your fish. The rice, nuts, dried fruits, and veg harmonized perfectly. My friends opted for the 1) shrimp, wild boar, and oyster gumbo; 2) roasted beef short rib; and 3) pickle brined fried chicken (with hot honey). I only tried the short rib - a perfect cube of rich, succulent meat - and oh boy was it tender. Dessert was a shocker. I opted for the Heath bar bread pudding and was presented with a giant block of spongy cake. Be still my heart. One of the largest bread puddings I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. I had to box up half of it to go (which made a marvelous morning workday pastry). The salted caramel and fresh cream were to die for. Only suggestion would be to add more Heath bar, as extra toffee never hurts. My friend's half-baked blondie with toasted marshmallow looked superb and she confirmed that it filled the blondie-shaped hole in our hearts due to B Bistro's closure. For fans of B's blondie, this is an equal counterpart. tl;dr: small starters + sides, but GIANT and luxurious mains + desserts. A trendy treat in Hampden - loved their dressed up twists on British pub food and Southern cooking. Skip a meal before you go to save space for the bread pudding."}, {"review_id": "S0SaIBmXxQC4HvErjLsRKQ", "user_id": "7NXTYSTcowTKMKZftUtN9Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I've been to Food Market several times now with a variety of experiences, and it's with a heavy heart that I settle on 3 stars. The thing is, Yelp's \"A-Ok\" guideline for 3 stars really hits the mark here, for both brunch and dinner. The service is good, the ambiance is great but the food is hit or miss, and despite a great presentation, generally errs on the bland side. HIT:Each time I've been here I've been very happy with the small dishes. - Avocado Toast -- always good- Brussels Sprouts -- crispy, delicious, and the chickpeas really make the dish.MISS:- Butternut Squash Omelette: Great idea with poor execution. I was expecting more of an effort to incorporate the butternut squash into the omelette. But it just has cubes of butternut squash in it, leaving the other ingredients tasting like a standard, rather unseasoned omelette. - Short Rib Benedict: Another great idea, meh execution. The short rib was well cooked but lacks flavor. Food Market has a great space and good service. I might be back with friends for some small plates and drinks, but overall it's not the go-to flavor-packed brunch experience I had hoped for."}, {"review_id": "92bz7Pmf_P9H9hSl0ZNlLA", "user_id": "hstpPlDzgNc5x4Bkp0Ntvw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "I had not been to the food market in over a year, as previous visits for dinner and brunch were good but nothing that blew me away or reminded me to make a reservation well in advance--don't expect to walk in on a weekend night.

The avocado was fresh, the poached eggs perfectly runny upon cracking into, and the ciabatta + goat cheese combination a delicious vehicle for it all. Chad's red quinoa \"oatmeal\" was one of the best things I've eaten recently though! Creamy, not overly sweet, with a punch of vanilla and just the right amount of texture from the quinoa.

Our server was so stoked for us each time we ordered food which made us feel confident that our choices were not going to disappoint! We started with the Amish pretzels off the app menu and the lobster fingers off the small plates. The pretzels came with a tiny mug of beer cheese and were delicious. The lobster fingers were very crispy and had just the right amount of breading. For our main, I got the wagyu steak frites with truffle fries and green beans. The steak was served over the house steak sauce, which was a great complement to the tender steak. And the truffle fries- oh my god, the fries were so good. I wish they had been bottomless. My boyfriend got the small crab cake with crab scalloped potatoes and green beans. He enjoyed the crab cake but we both agreed the crab scalloped potatoes stole the spotlight. We ended dinner with the half baked blondies. We ordered not one, but two, and good thing we did because we p much licked those bowls clean. The toasted marshmallow was a great addition to the dish.
