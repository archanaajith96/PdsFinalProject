So I searched Yelp for a good salad in North Wilmington, and they sent me to Goat. Wow, what a nice place. It was lunch, so no drinking, but I was tempted by the beer and whiskey selection. Salad was great, field greens, pickled onions, fried green tomatoes, and delicious goat cheese ... really hit the spot, taking some of the sting out of this d*** diet. Just enough homemade green goddess to make it tasty without defeating the purpose. Soon I will be returning with my wife/d.d. to really go through the menu and enjoy the food and beverage and cool vibe that this place seems to offer."}, {"review_id": "KkLGfVwqJGchfeOGGi-DWw", "user_id": "PgzU7MzNrdLI3xLwme1BUA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "This review is for a to-go order:The food here is on point. Ordered simple items, but simple is sometimes difficult to achieve. It was a must to try the fried green tomatoes. Paired with the house salad and green goddess dressing, I was extremely happy with this choice. The mood to snack was lingering so I gave the seasoned fries and goat cheese bread a go.  Every morsel of food, spice, and dipping sauce was enjoyable... now that's the food, and the reason for even entering the doors. As for the hospitality - that's a different story. And I completely understand the mixed reviews. Now, me personally, I am not a sensitive person and will do fine obtaining a order and not receiving attention from staff... but that's me... however the majority expect attentiveness when dining. I must say - I've never in my life sat down at a bar and was not asked if I would like a cocktail or drink while I wait... they had all these cool syrups and fresh condiments, I'm certain their drinks would have been comparable to the food. I can totally understand why people felt they were not welcomed."}, {"review_id": "AFyVuO6HAw6xZKfgh6Xi0Q", "user_id": "NieiBWM7Xh69ylwZaRNiTw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "New to Wilmington my girlfriend and I were lured to the Goat due to its \"great\" review.  We arrived around dinner time and there were a few people at the bar and one other couple sitting in the corner. The atmosphere was gloomy and damp feeling.  Our waitress brought us the menu and I inquired about their beer selection. As pleasant as she was she was sniffling and hovered over my back as she explained the beers. With her breath all over me I had to look away so I didn't want to catch a cold. As we were waiting for the food, I watched as entire staff stood behind the glass wall eating away and chit chatting. I understand the staff needs to break and eat in plain view is just very tacky.  On top of that our waitress busted out the broom and began to sweep. On to the food, I ordered crispy red snapper with coconut curry on jasmine rice and the girlfriend ordered a pizza topped with caramelized onions and goat cheese. I took a knife into my fish and noticed it was soggy half deep fried filet with the skin still on the bottom half of it. I am a eater so I tried to ignore it and continued and had a bit of the rice. The rice was stuck together in chunks and my girlfriend thought it was mashed potatoes. The curry was cold. I don't know if that was intentional but it was literally out of the fridge cold. As for the pizza it was flavorless. My girlfriend usually is not a picky eater but I can tell she hated it. She had half a slice of a full pizza and left the rest.Overall I honestly don't leave negative reviews but I had to download the app to warn fellow patrons. Do not read all the positive reviews regarding this place. I strongly believe they are fake reviews. Especially the dude who wrote about the delicious salad. NO dudes takes photos and raves about a horrible looking salad."}, {"review_id": "WW-h03N8joTtGY_D6QE4ig", "user_id": "hVPyu7QWaSQgOlz0rppmkg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Ended up here on a road trip to and from our flooring place. Little divey kind of place in a small strip mall. Had a few of the craft cocktails which were well made and tasty. Would like to see a greater selection, but bartender was talented. Had the White Trash appetizer - a sharp pimento cheese board that was pretty good but a tad expensive for its size. Nonetheless, they have an interesting menu that's creative so next time we're in the area will give the menu a try."}, {"review_id": "TfDRJHxk4eX3hJN0IYlTLA", "user_id": "NGGd_11d2RXR8wTurenLgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/11/2017", "text": "My daughter and I recently had a fabulous lunch here.  Besides one other table, we were the only people in there - not that surprising for a weekday though.  I couldn't help thinking that people were missing out - the food was just really good and the atmosphere/décor were really nice as well.  We ended up sharing the sausage and pimento cheese appetizer and the fried green tomato BLT - both were fabulous.  I had also ordered the pork belly bahn mi but ended up taking it home and enjoying it for my lunch the next day - it was my first time trying a bahn mi and now I can't wait to have another.Hope to get my husband to take me to lunch here soon - maybe over the holiday."}, {"review_id": "IQ7263BEqSStN00dV6W4gg", "user_id": "nEj5sXaReOaS4P7j_mLdXg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "This little hidden gem was amazing.

Anyway, we walked in and were welcomed by a empty hostess stand in a 7ft by 7ft drapped \"waiting area\" with no seating. Everyone seemed to know eachother so we're like \"great\" neighborly vibes... all of a sudden the room seemed to shrink us...no warm welcome, nothing.Again while standing and not being told by the bartender who was in arms reach from this area that we could seat ourselves, nothing. Absolutely horrible service. If it were not for my sister just saying forget it I would have definitely had a fit. NEVER been treated so unimportant in a establishment that serves people.

Scoping out new local places to eat near our new home and this place pops up. It's in a small shopping center so plenty of parking. Service was fast and friendly. We came in on a rainy Saturday originally for brunch and there were a few people inside as well as 2 people at the bar. Inside décor was really nice the side wall was made up of diff doors and who atmosphere is kind of eclectic country chic meets industrial bar. Utensils are on the table in a jar, and they even had disposable chopsticks which I actually really appreciate!My bf and I wanted to try their Korean wings and he ended up getting a lunch item the Holstein but I think it's the same as Snitzelwich(crispy pork loin swiss caramelized onions curry pickles baby greens and smoked French dressing) but with a fried egg on top! And I opted for the Big Daddy Benedict which has tobasco sausage on it. Both were delicious and we really liked the wings. We didn't get any adult beverages this time but we will be on our next trip! I'm so happy we found this place and its 2 min from our new home. We cannot wait to bring friends here. Oh and check out their website it has their menu and beer list. Also you can get \"provisions\" to enjoy at home!"}, {"review_id": "khYhYd4z0lKnyQ1moVtCrA", "user_id": "CdmQfB4-zWqm00ZAufloFg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/24/2018", "text": "Food is really good and I can't remember what I had to drink but I thought it was quite tasty. Here is where I will admit to not being much of a beer drinker but the selection looked to be big and my beer-swilling friends said it was good.But seriously, the food was very good. And the waitstaff were all friendly and helpful. It had a nice selection of sandwiches and small plates. I had mussels and a beet salad - both were great. My friend had a burger and fries and was quite happy (she's a picky orderer too and they got everything right). The menu is not huge but pretty comprehensive and should cover a pretty wide variety of dietary restrictions.The vibe is friendly pub with some hipster mixed in. It had a wide mix from families to middle-agers to younger people enjoying post-work drinks. It's noise level was about average - not quiet but you could carry on a conversation without yelling. I don't think it would be a great place for small children but older kids were there."}, {"review_id": "jK9A9GrsHtw1H7WYbqhANA", "user_id": "gVquXDgw8oxm93FZdTUskQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Love this place.

I have dined there about six times and really only enjoyed it twice. I give up. I think it's reviewed well because there isn't much competition for them in the area, not because it's actually good. Let's talk fried green tomatoes- first time I was there the Fried Green Tomato BLT was great. The tomatoes were crispy and bright. Ever since, I have found them greasy, bland and tasted like they were cooked in old oil. You may ask why keep trying, valid observation. My grandmother made the best fried green tomatoes and so I've been foolishly optimistic that Goat can re-create my first experience. I've learned my lesson. No more. Next \"Sell my Soul\" Thai noodle soup! Please, I'd sell my soul if they actually put vegetables, herbs and some damn constancy into its preparation! At the same table two us got the exact same soup. Both totally different colors. The other was very spicy and mine was bland as hell. I think they put my spice in his. It's also so messy and unless you wear a bib, or possess magic abilities, it eludes me how one can eat this soup without getting it all over themselves. Cocktails- again depends on the day. Sometimes okay and other times undrinkable. Never astonishing and definitely not better than you can make at home yourself. Service- again unpredictable. Sometimes you can't get a refill on beverages to save your life and other times the server is excessively friendly and not in a good way. That kind of close-talking, desperate sort of way. It makes me uncomfortable. I'll concede that the $5 plate of goat cheese toast is tasty but it's goat cheese on a toasted baguette and honey. How hard is it to screw that's up? But I'll bet Goat will find a way to do just that and I'm confident they already have."}, {"review_id": "ZreU-F5tatpG7ki3UgHS9Q", "user_id": "mtj0jBbWx0BVo5sSF3sEMg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/27/2018", "text": "It's always crowded and slow.
