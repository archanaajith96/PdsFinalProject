I mean, they have EVERYTHING. The menu is so extensive and their breakfast menu blows my mind. The stuffed hashbrowns aren't something you typically see but they are incredible and filling. One order of the stuffed hashbrowns and you're set for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Usually, we just get a to-go order because this place is always packed. But despite how busy they are, our order never takes longer than 15 minutes to get (from phone call to pick-up). That's pretty impressive in my book. Efficient, delicious and inexpensive. I give this place bonus points too because they have never messed up any of our orders. If we order extra of anything or substitute anything, I can trust everything is there and as it should be. Do yourself and favor and stop in!"}, {"review_id": "wCQDYzGhWib-JLDCPXTj2g", "user_id": "wEF0VebW9gGYIg32phj_Mw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2017", "text": "If you like breakfast, you like The Pancake Place. I'm greeted with a carafe of coffee for the table (never stuck waiting for a fresh cup!) every time, with prompt service from everyone's favorite lady--Linda. She knows her regulars by name and always makes you feel at home.Excellent customer service continues when you get to pick from a huge menu like theirs... Family loves the giant fluffy pancakes and eggs benedict, but I always get the hash browns stuffed with eggs, veggies, cheese, and anything else you want. Even a half order means I take home leftovers!Being experts on all the breakfast classics comes at a low cost at The Pancake Place. Just be prepared for a wait if you plan on arriving after 9 am... everybody else wants their plate of delicious, too."}, {"review_id": "BLMOPBm3VxvDv0LowHnzcw", "user_id": "-X0Lm2MC0SoGKtKOGzzdWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "This place is the bee's knees! We are visiting from out of state and were recommended this place from a local. We loved it so much we came back twice! The food was amazing and the service even better. Linda was our first waitress and even though we didn't get her again she still dropped by our table to  say good morning! As someone who probably sees many people throughout her shift, it was a nice gesture that she remembered us. The food was delicious! I've never had buttery hash browns the way they make them. There were plenty of vegetarian options, as well as the portions of food was just great! Would really recommend this place to anyone visiting Wisconsin!"}, {"review_id": "GTlnNRdHSAb8fBMTaXvGlw", "user_id": "ff_SS5Wf5jeotkzmheMFrg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/27/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I've been eating here for years, mostly breakfast.

Walked in for a quick 20 minute wait. The waiting area was small and right next to the bathrooms. A lot of locals waiting to be seated, good sign! I ordered The Country style stuffed hashbrowns and they were out of this world! Don't get a half order be a man / woman and get the full order! I always rate my restaurants on how well the pancakes taste so I always order one as a standard. Their pancakes are very good!

Holy Smokes! If you are looking for a stellar breakfast at a diner-esk establishment this is the place to go. As a Wisconsinite turned Washingtonian, I wasn't sure what to expect when I turned up here with a few of my friends (who weren't locals). This place came highly recommended as a Green Bay classic, so I knew we had to give it a try. Unfortunately, this place doesn't take reviews, so get in early and beat that church crowd. The breakfast, it's the mother load. You have found the Mecca of pancakes, thank God this place is rightfully named The Pancake Place. With way too much food on the menu, it's broken down by categories. I was completely overwhelmed with the menu, but that didn't hinder Linda Lou's awesome attitude and playfulness with our table. Linda Lous pointed us in the right direction and helped us make some serious decisions. With a few pancakes ordered, coffee flowing like Grey Goose at a club and a big appetite we got down to business and feasted like it was the America's first Thanksgiving. This isn't even an exaggeration because that's how much food there was. By the time Linda Lou came back to ask if everything was okay, it looked like we hadn't even touched our food, but we did. We attacked it and there was STILL that much left. What we got:Ham and cheese omelet- yum! Basic diner omelet. No-frills, nothing fancy, but sure hit the spot. This came with toast or a muffin. I opted for sourdough toast (tons of bread options) and home fries! Chocolate chip pancake to split. We ordered one pancake and these pancakes are the size of a dinner plate. They're not messing around. I love how mass-produced pancakes taste. They are always super fluffy and they have the perfect amount of chocolate chips. Eggs benedict--yeahhh, that's what I'm saying. This place doesn't scream order eggs benedict or a poached egg here. Needless to say, a few of my friends ordered this and they had the option to do half or full plate. They did the full portion because they were sharing and still this was a ton of food. Opt for the half portion unless you are totally famished. Back to the eggs...do not get some fancy-dancy egg type here. It's not the place. When they ask how you want your eggs your response should be, in my pancakes. I am so tickled that The Pancake Place was a recommendation because otherwise, I don't know if I ever would have found or stopped by this hidden treasure (that's really not so hidden).TL;DR- MAKE THIS A PRIORITY STOP. You can thank me later. In advance, you are welcome."}, {"review_id": "3OR2_rNfgqcXNnN4HK_qcw", "user_id": "scwBw7cnOSeZdt32ze1B4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "The staff was so friendly and welcoming, our server specifically had us laughing the whole time, very small town diner type of feel with a menu that doesn't quite!

The service was amazing, our food was out within minutes and the wait staff was very attentive to our needs.  The biscuits tasted fresh and the gravy was very flavorful.
