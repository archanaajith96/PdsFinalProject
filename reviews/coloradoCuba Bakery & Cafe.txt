These flaky, filled with cream cheese delights are topped with sugar and just melt in your mouth.The last time I was here, I also enjoyed a beef empanada and chorizo empanada. Both were highly flavorful and quite filling.  They offer a wide variety of desserts (I keep coming back to the cheese pastries though) and they also have a steam table full of (what looks like) delicious food (haven't yet tried any of it. I live out of town, but next time I come here, I'll make sure to try something new)."}, {"review_id": "TR0ib4DdhrRRtCkat3ybTQ", "user_id": "RB2vYsGtffWIqo4VqAXb_A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/18/2017", "text": "This place is fantastic, really takes me back to when I lived in Orlando. Staff was super friendly and gave us the whole breakdown on what to get. I of course already knew what I wanted and my wife loved the arroz con pollo.They also have a full bakery which I can't wait to try on my next visit."}, {"review_id": "QeVpFgPJNLgg_RjtJ8a9mg", "user_id": "P6oADNr3avg5HlI58mS5zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Delicious food, great service! The empanadas are fresh and flavorful; I love the beef one, in particular. Pastries are flaky, perfectly glazed, with to-die-for fillings (especially the guava). The cafe con leche is subtly sweet. Prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food and drink. Great place to grab breakfast or lunch!"}, {"review_id": "CrOX7GN8rIYaiDpQ7u6D3Q", "user_id": "347dZGbDyo0xUvycMhX02Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Great find!

Boy, am I glad we did. The other yelpers were not exaggerating when they said this place was good. We've eaten at some great Cuban restaurants around Florida and Cuba Bakery is right there with them. And it's here in Colorado! Wow. The amount of food that they give you for around $9 is absurd. I just laughed when the server piled the lechón on my plate. I couldn't believe my eyes. We ordered lechón an ropa vieja which comes with your choice of 4 different styles of rice and sweet plantains or yucca. The coffee was very good, near great. If I had one criticism about this place, it would be the disorder when ordering and paying. If you get claustrophobic you may wanna send someone in for your order. But overall, this place is excellent. I would definitely recommend."}, {"review_id": "SG90ksVEygNlhDL9iVBTnw", "user_id": "ncvmAFngVYpNSANH6ZeGow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Found this gem using Yelp.  Delicious food.  Reasonable prices.  Friendly service.

All the sweet that they have tasted so disgusting I order 2 cannoli, 1 flan, 1 cheese cake, 1 cream burlee (yes I had a sweet craving that day don't judge me!) I went home  and ate the hot empanadas it was so yummy and full of favor so I was excited to try the dessert I literally took 1 bite of every desert hoping the next one will be better but NOPE all nasty! So I toss it right in the trash, it tasted old and it has that old fridge smell to it and the texture wasn't right in any of them, they either use cheap ingredients to cut down cost or the dessert was purchase through a food vender and they seriously need to learn when to throw away old stuff and not sell it to people!"}, {"review_id": "h0iHpgHcgnqZ4r7rajvXLw", "user_id": "7X7piUWFGkANXGmZvvPBew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Holly cow this place is awesome!

Was in the area for a class and went exploring. Cuban (the pork was not overdone, nice and moist), fried yucca (good but was in a pre-made section and a little cold), and a café.

According to family, the chef they had today wasn't the better of the two that work there. The sandwich needed more sauce as well as more spice to the meat.I tried a little bit of their flan and it was very good. Almost worthy of bumping the review another star. Same as the coffee, if you enjoy Cuban / Latin coffee - it was tasty.The employees were generally very nice to nice enough. I'm not a fan of a $10 minimum for credit cards, but I understand as a small business, it helps them stay afloat.I will try them again soon. Hopefully I'll get the better chef and go to 4 stars.Edit: yup. Agree with other reviews that many of these pastries taste previously frozen. By that, I mean they taste like they absorbed other flavors - some of which aren't my fav...."}, {"review_id": "hNPDosIJTovO0nc6mXMinw", "user_id": "aU0CevC2cazlL0FiBiSxQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "6/2/2017", "text": "For a little hole in the wall, this place is pretty cute.
