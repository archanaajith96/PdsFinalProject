The Food is exquisite, the Parmesan Crusted Chicken is my favorite and the wine is reasonably priced, $5.00 a glass if you go during Happy Hour (Monday - Friday; 3pm-6pm). Also you can try 8 samples of wine for only $7.00. I love wine so to me that is worth it. My Cousin had her Bridal Shower there and the services was wonderful and the private room was spacious. I definitely would recommend it for a Bridal/ Baby shower or even a private work/birthday event.  Parking is decent and if you are looking for a spot for a ladies night or a romantic dinner. I definitely recommend Cooper's Hawk!"}, {"review_id": "nKBSR5NFNY7L_t2LolF9SQ", "user_id": "UQKxRmpP8-wimOrsB1umWA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I came here a few days ago for dinner with an out-of-town family member, and had wanted to take them somewhere that would both provide a nice ambience for us to talk and catch up, while also giving them a good impression of the Tampa area and its food scene - I will say, I was not disappointed with my choice to bring them here!Cooper's Hawk is nestled within a bustling plaza filled with a lot of other note-worthy dinner contenders. Walking into the restaurant, I loved how open and spacious the lobby/waiting area was, with its impressive array of wine and barrels. The actual dining/seating areas are dimly lit, but surrounded with large windows that help lighten the place up. Our waitress was very nice and helpful with providing suggestions, and ultimately I settled on the short rib risotto with parmesan and truffle oil, and my family member opted for the churrasco steak with fries, roasted veggies, and a glass of red wine. The flavors of my risotto were wonderful, and the short rib was extremely tender! The only drawback there was the rice didn't seem cooked enough - it was firmer than what I would've liked. I didn't try any of the steak dish or red wine, but it received glowing reviews nonetheless. :)For dessert, I ordered the S'mores Budino and my family member got a cappuccino. The S'mores Budino was absolutely the highlight of the meal for me - seriously SO good! It's a toasted graham crust layered with rich and sweet caramel custard, a thick and slightly bittersweet Valhrona chocolate ganache, and a nice heaping topping of toasted marshmallow fluff. I loved it! I didn't try the cappuccino, but it did look well made - velvety foam and a nice caramelly espresso color. Pricing here was right about where I'd expect, for the caliber and location of this restaurant. Overall, I was pleased with my experience here! I wouldn't come here for just-because dinners, but for special occasions this is definitely a place worth checking out!"}, {"review_id": "Rm4Rb0-JSB_JDaYHeJC4Cw", "user_id": "7fCB6aorr51lHsVWErFVmA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "First of all I was worried that we were going to need to have a back up plan for Friday \"date night\" because there were no reservations available for my 7:30 time slot. We arrived and were quick to find a parking spot which is always a good sign as the lot shares real estate with a few other dining spots and there is also valet available. Our plan was to grab a drink and a few appetizers and then do the wine tasting and pick up our monthly wine of choice for club members.We walked in and the wine tasting area was super loud and three deep as usual. Suprisingly the hostess said that we could be seated right away if we chose inside dining and we quickly agreed...We picked 3 appetizers, Cooperhawk Calamari, Roasted Veggie and Goat Cheese Flatbread and Crispy Brussels SproutsCashews, Mint, Sweet Thai Chili, Sesame-Sriracha Aioli... The calamari is all rings, light crispy and sticky-sweet... pairs well with the dipping sauce which has a slight kick but not spicy....The flat bread was nice, the blend of veggies was tasy and balanced with the goat cheese.. neither were over powering.... my disappointment was the Crispy Brussels Sprouts,, both my hubby and I are a big fan of Brussels Sprouts and these were super bitter... I found myself digging through the mint to get to the brussels as they were buried in it and it was not what I was expecting...The pretzel bread arrived with the appetizers which I would have preferred the bread while we were waiting and enjoying our wine..Overall I would give this dining room visit a 4 star and never order the brussel sprouts again...Since we were there to pick up our monthly wine club selection we headed to the wine tasting area which was now 4 people deep and super loud... we opted to skip the tasting and just get our wine and a few truffles and head home to enjoy them.. The server told me I had 6 bottle due for pick up, not realizing I hadn't been there since Feb. I was a little excited now and asked to see the wine list.. I made my choices of 2 Romance red, 1 White Sangria,1 Red Sangria, 1 Cabernet Savignon and a Tempranillo de Espana. My husband chose 2 Baileys and 2 White Chocolate Truffles and out we go!... When I arrived home we tried the Baileys Truffles and they were amazing! The White Chocolate however was so disgustingly sweet, we actually couldn't eat more than the first bite... If you like sweet these are for you!... When I unpacked my wine I noticed that I was given 2 Sweet Red instead of 2 Romance and since it is about a 30 minute drive from home, I will suck it up this time and make sure I check before leaving next time.I really wish the tasting area was larger and able to accomodate the crowds that they get :("}, {"review_id": "20h9MVLnhjwI6XoFabbVyw", "user_id": "iCYMf_sHRevmzWg8la-LVw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Was really excited to come here on our last night. They didn't have any availability the night before so got to finally try it on a Tuesday night. Love how you step in and there's wine tasting and tons of wine gifts.We were seated quickly and 2 minutes before HH ended. Ordered two glasses of wine and the brussels sprouts appetizer. The brussels sprouts were one of the best I had! The cashews and sesame-sriracha sauce were the perfect touch, absolutely delicious. The pretzel bread they give you is so good too. Nice and warm! However, I am docking 2 stars as our waiter was so not attentive to us, and when we asked for more bread, he never brought it. He seemed actually annoyed with us with any requests.All the entrees looked so amazing, originally I wanted the short rib gnocchi since I never saw such a combination. But I decided to go the healthy route and got the soy ginger salmon. The wasabi buttered mashed potatoes complimented it perfectly. The slaw I didn't care for since it was smothered in cilantro.Overall, amazing food and wine, but service could be stepped up a ton."}, {"review_id": "m3z2J_fXuPKblQgSRyRFoQ", "user_id": "z4Bvefqd1bV7hwAuM7LJbw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "After arriving in Tampa, I was looking for a good lunch spot close to the airport. After a quick Google search, I decided on Cooper's Hawk and I was glad I did. Cooper's is located in a trendy part of town in a large shopping center so parking isn't an issue. What makes Cooper's unique is that it's both a winery and a restaurant. As you walk in, you'll see people taking part in wine tastings. If you're dining in, there's both a bar area and a sit-down area where you can eat. It's a pretty large property, you can't even see the dine-in area once you walk in. After I was seated and ordered, they bring you out some complimentary pretzel bread and butter. They have lunch specials every day of the week, including weekends. I went with the chicken piccata lunch special which came with a generous portion of chicken in a lemon sauce with capers, peas, and angel hair pasta. The food was great all-around. Service was good too, just a little too \"salesy\" for my taste. Added bonus: since Cooper's is both a restaurant and a winery, sipping on good wine while you eat is a no-brainer."}, {"review_id": "Xtv99qA4yowccsPBaq_H0g", "user_id": "lhxw-SrSgE9CycFdIxlaEg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/21/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I can't wait to go back!! I went on a Friday night for their wine tasting and man what a fun experience. It's $7 and you get to try 8 wines! You also get to try their truffles for $1 each! I was in awe of their deal, and the fantastic wine selection. They have local wine, Italian wine, Cooper's Hawk wine. So many to choose from. We went with the December collection and had the opportunity to try 3 white, 4 red and one dessert wine. Actually one of the red was out of stalk so they let you choose any other wine you want to try.It's a very casual wine tasting experience. You're standing in the lobby of the restaurant and you order your next taste at the counter/bar. I would recommend they add some music to make the experience a 5/5! The ladies that serve are fantastic, knowledgeable and kind. Make sure you bring cash for the tips however. The way the system is set up it won't let you put the tip on your credit card when you pay, which is such a shame; they really need to do something about that. These ladies deserve  their tip!

It's not one of my \"top dog\" night out type of places but it's somewhere I always bring out-of-towners for their happy hour and a wine tasting. The Happy Hour is Awesome. They have both apps and drinks on the happy hour menu AND you can sit anywhere in the restaurant... even outside! The drink specials are $5/glass of wine or wine cocktail and $7 for liquor cocktails. The appetizers range from $5-$7. My personal faves are the Asian BBQ Pork Belly Tostadas, the Crispy Brussels Sprouts (the best I've had at a restaurant), and the Bin 61 Sour (Woodford, Lemon Sour and Nightjar). I also belong to the wine club which is an awesome deal. There are 1 bottle/month and 2 bottle/month options. We do the 2 bottle membership which also comes with two wine tastings per month for $29.99. The bottle carry over each month but the wine tastings do not. This keeps us going back once a month to make sure we use our wine tasting! The wine club also has point perks and free dinner on your birthday.The entrees are also great . I love the Trio of Medallions.. three small filets: horseradish, blue cheese, Parmesan. They are to-die-for.I'll be back at some point this month for those crispy brussels sprouts and a wine tasting."}, {"review_id": "PfS0lvIKw5YtAO1Rm3T9Pw", "user_id": "q5iz5euFdokOYHpN9njz_g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "This location of Cooper's Hawk is consistently good.

This bread is like crack. Seriously addictive. They have a plethora of appetizers. I like to get a flatbread for the table to share. Their soups are tasty, as well. I recently tried their French Onion and it was a perfect ratio of bread to broth.My favorite item was removed from the menu awhile back - Chicken Saltimbocca. Now I'll do the braised short ribs or another chicken dish, like the Chicken Madeira. Salads are good here, too. Very large! I enjoy the Mediterranean with Shrimp. If there for lunch, the Cilantro Ranch Chicken Dan which is good.I've also been several times for wine tastings. It's relatively inexpensive to stand in the front and try a few!Only downside I ever have is that lunch service can be very slow."}, {"review_id": "m9qcqc66VIYsYucFn4flTQ", "user_id": "KlKyuFEp1dLCYxstjGpIzg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "FANTTASTIC!

It's probably one of my favorite restaurants in the area and I've never had a bad experience there!I've been to some other CH's around the US, but this one surpasses all of them. I love the set up. It's fun to do tastings while waiting for your table and even more fun to grab a sweet treat at the counter after dinner. CH has an excellent Happy Hour with lots of good apps and deals of wine. The drunken shrimp are one of my favorites, along with the hummus platter. Wine wise, this is heaven. They offer multiple flights and the servings of the flights are actually really large compared to many flights I've had at other places. (One of my fave wines is the blueberry--it's delic and also dangerous bc it goes down toooo easy!)I've never had a bad meal here. Some of my faves are the Brussel sprouts salad; braised short ribs; pistachio crusted grouper; bbq chicken salad; and the chicken tortilla soup. I also love the wedge salad (big enough to be your meal!).Service is always fabulous. Sometimes, the wait can be long if you don't have reservations, but if you stake out the bar area, a lot of times you can grab a table pretty quickly! The patio is often open sooner, too.Parking can be tight, as the lot is shared by many other places.

Been for drinks and happy hour, they offer happy hour Monday to Friday 3PM-6PM with $5 Wines by the glass, $7 cocktails, $5 Wine Specialty Drinks of Sangria, Cooper's Hawk Bellini, Champagne Cocktail, and Cooper's Hawk Mimosa. When you first walk in there's a tasting room where you can try the wines (like a winery in Napa) then a bar to one side and the dining room in the back and a patio area. It's all beautifully decorated. They do not take reservations for tasting but do for dinner. For dinner we went on a Saturday night, had 545 reservations and were seated after a couple minutes wait. They have several different wine flights you can choose or make your own. Ordered the red flight and a make your own flight with the higher end wines. The zinfandel and petite syrah and Lux cabernet sauvignon were my favorites. For appetizer ordered the crab and lobster bisque and the Asian Pork belly tostadas: Scallions, Sesame Seeds, Cilantro, Radish, Sweet Chili BBQ Sauce. The soup came out right away but for some reason we waited almost 25 minutes for the appetizer but it was worth the wait. Great flavor, tender pork belly. The only recommendation would be to serve it on something a little more easy to eat (mini taco?) , it was a little messy falling off the tostadas. For my main dish I got the Maple, Mustard & Pretzel Crusted Boneless Pork Chop with Mary's Potatoes, Oven-Roasted Vegetables. I did my research on Yelp of the most popular item to order and this was the most acclaimed one. It had good flavor, potatoes (mashed)  and veggies were delicious. I felt that the pork chop was a little dry and not as juicy as it had been described, but overall a very good dish, good maple and mustard flavor. My friend got the Campanelle Shrimp Rustic, Italian Sausage, Caramelized Onion, Tomato-Parmesan Cream. This was an excellent flavorful dish, the cream sauce was nice and light and didn't overwhelm the dish. Our entrees took another 20 minute to come out after we had finished our appetizers. Luckily we had plenty of wine to keep us occupied. The desserts all looked delicious but we were full. Overall a very good experience, service was great, wine was fantastic, kitchen was a little slow that night but it was a busy Saturday night so have to keep that in mind.There is a private parking lot on site shared with other nearby restaurants and can fill up but they have valet or the parking garage available."}, {"review_id": "C0-QHWVx0eNsCah-wBAgbg", "user_id": "5nLsZ3ouFAlysZ8QICEaTA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/9/2018", "text": "Cooper Hawks has the best happy hour 3- 6 pm Monday thru Friday. $5,$6 & $7 QUALITY drinks.

My only complaint is that parking here sucks at this location and there's not enough space at the tasting bar. It's located off of Boy Scout right next-door to Texas de Brazil and other notable restaurants around the area across from the International Plaza mall. The entry area has a winetasting bar which is limited in space, as I mentioned before. During busy hours, you may have to fight for the next spot available for your group and just squeeze on in. The tastings are very informational. From my experience, the staff does a very good job explaining each sample. The menu changes quite frequently so don't expect the same list of wines the next time. If you don't like your sample, they'll just change it out and give you another one at no additional cost to your bill.In the same tasting area is a gift shop with cute/clever wine related merchandise if you're into that. Beyond this area towards the back is the restaurant portion. The food here is really good. They have good happy hour specials from 3 to 6 PM Monday through Friday.
