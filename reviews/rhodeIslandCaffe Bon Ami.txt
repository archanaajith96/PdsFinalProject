I wish I could go more often but I spend most of my days in Providence and never make it back in time to Cranston for an afternoon pick-me-up. I had the most divine cappuccino yesterday morning on my day off but today I'm having a convenient, mediocre at best, cappuccino from Starbucks. :( As far as prices go, Caffe Bon Ami is actually a little cheaper than popular chains nearby plus they have much better quality coffee. I can still remember exactly how it tasted. That's how you know it's good - when it leaves a lasting impression! One thing I've learned though since my previous visits is asking for less sugar such as 1.5 per every small cup. It's so good I wish they were open late for around-the-clock espresso fiends like me. :)"}, {"review_id": "VuJkfOzwfnRme2xfkFKIhg", "user_id": "vM5OIGCJbrj31ppuYQ5Xcw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "I have been to this place 5 or so times. Like others have said the drinks and food are good, the staff is also very attentive and cordial. However I have no idea how the staff is so positive when the owner is such a miserable jerk. I was there with two others today at noon and two people were in front of us in line. The owner shouted at us \"I had a lot of call outs today and we have a very limited menu. I'll try to make you a beverage and I don't know what food we have.\" He turned around and continued struggling to pour a drink and toast a waffle for the group in front of us. He offered no indication of what menu items were available as we stared blankly at the menu. He offered no apology or indication that he wanted to serve us. After 5 minutes he yelled \"LAST WAFFLE\" and continued. After 8-10 minutes of waiting, even though another staff member was there, we left.I completely understand other reviewers frustration with his lack of customer service. Also, being cash only I'm sure he loves paying employees in cash and pocketing the tax dollars. His sign at the register \"I hate morning people. And mornings. And People\" encapsulates this man better than nay anecdote could. There are too many other good coffee places in the area for this guy to deserve your hard earned money."}, {"review_id": "RRtA6V2Wam-0Hl2MZRoKIw", "user_id": "4ud2jB1N8_8iTXcp2660KA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Five star coffee, cozy New England style atmosphere and an owner with more personality than you can shake a stick at.I don't know how many times I've driven past this place but I suddenly regret every single one, from the moment you walk in the aromas that assault you are dangerously delicious, the menu offers a plethora of options and the staff is super friendly.The owner is full of energy and clearly dedicated to his craft. I don't hand out five star reviews often but this place clearly stands out as a best in class!I recommend driving out of your way, but this place is cash only!

Smells good and is very clean. Decor is nice. Latte was very good. Sandwiches were good. THE UGLY: Latte is a cappuccino.This is the place where to local old crew sits and talks badly about other countrys (and say jews) LOUDLY (of which they seemed to have never researched the topic besides maybe on fox and friends). If we happened to be from a country they were talking about we would have been offended. No workers or owner dont seem to care. Dont think the owner is actually french.

Yes!!

The owner is a super douche and made shitty comments about  how he doesn't close early enough and how he wishes a truck would run into his building after a few people got in line. We waited at the register for a good 15 minutes as the next people in line without a \"hey sorry about the wait we will be with you in a second.\"  We ordered and the lady behind us ordered. The owner knew her and made her coffee before ours. Our panini was done before our coffees were finished. I was uncomfortable the entire time I was in there. The panini was great but you couldn't pay me to come back. There are countless reviews that say what a jerk the owner is. I wish I would have checked yelp first, but I didn't think 2 drinks and a panini warranted that much research!"}, {"review_id": "NHHORv0NB5McPRQ_Wk8oPg", "user_id": "fzyRqqSZJl0SUTKQeOXliQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Went there today because I was craving crepes. My go to for savory crepes is Duck and Bunny but this place is much closer to my work and has mostly good reviews so I gave it a shot. The place was full of Cranston PD and locals chatting and the owner was behind the counter overseeing things (aka dicking around on his phone). I placed my order (one of their \"speciality\" crepes on the menu. Nothing difficult) and was instructed to sit and wait for it in the cafe. I waited. And waited. Aaaaand waited. I remained patient because after all it was 10am on a Saturday and it's a tiny place with minimal staff. At some point I saw the miniscule sign that says the only take cash so I ran to a nearby atm and came back. My food was still not ready. It has now been a half hour and I'm pissed. I approached the cashier and she blankly stares at me. I walk over to the doorway where the kitchen is and the girl on the grill apologizes and says my ticket somehow got lost. Between 2 employees in an 8x8 area. At no point did anyone ask me what I was waiting for (sitting alone at a table with no drink) or if I needed anything the ENTIRE TIME I sat and waited. The owner was walking around taking pictures of customers and their food, I assume for this facebook page. He also observed the entire interaction between his staff and I. I left. The only person to apologize to me was the cook. I spoke with the owner as I was leaving and he shrugged his shouders, no apology offered. Nice. Customer service goes a long way, even if your order gets messed up or you have to wait. Sadly this place doesn't get that. There are way better breakfast/coffee/brunch places in RI that value their customers. Don't waste your time here."}, {"review_id": "lvYIPzNX-EFDkLYnQ2mN3w", "user_id": "FVBJLe0RJEaE70ILJgGLQA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "I absolutely LOVE this place.

The crepes both regular and buckwheat are so tasty.  I get the fresh spinach, egg, cheese and ham. There are other different options for stuffing the crepes.

I just didn't.I have driven by this place countless times. Just never stopped in. With no Starbucks en route and craving a simple yet strong iced coffee, I pulled in. The place was full and judging from the interaction of the owner and the customers, there is much repeat traffic in there. I wanted a simple iced coffee. I asked the man behind the counter (presumably the owner) if the chocolate covered strawberry iced coffee was from flavored beans or added flavor shots. He said the brewed bean flavored iced coffee was delicious and tasted exactly like chocolate covered strawberries. Yeah, well it didn't. After shelling out $3.75 for this small \"medium/lg\" sized iced coffee, I actually walked outside and threw it out. I felt like it was over priced. Hell, Starbucks TRENTA (actually size of an entire bottle of wine) cost $3.75 and is much better.It seems the reviews rave about the lattes and specialty drinks- so maybe that was the issue. I didn't order a complex drink. Who knows. Either way, probably won't be coming back."}, {"review_id": "MFkw39WNl5gxhrJATQHiMQ", "user_id": "r1qUvt_9E8MWeEAipj1qpw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "Today I stopped in Caffe Bon Ami for a vanilla latte and egg sandwich.

The waffle was light on the inside with a crispy exterior. I know what you're thinking - \"eggs\"? Yes, eggs. And they were delicious, with herbs and olive oil. Note that it's cash only.
