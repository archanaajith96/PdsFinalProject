If you need to deliver someone a meal who is sick or just had a baby or something, then get them a lasagna, salads, and a fresh baguette from Cucina. Do it right and make their night. Side note: There is a quote behind the counter that reads \"Fear is not real. It is a product of thoughts you create. Do not misunderstand me. Danger is very real. But fear is a choice.\" I love this quote. After some research it appears that Will Smith says it in a sci-fi flick, but whatever. Side note 2: This could be a sneaky date place. They have a side patio that screams for wine to be drank there, and indeed it is. Take your lover there. You can ride scooters next door while waiting for your food before the wine, of course. We're trying to get you fed, not killed."}, {"review_id": "Hlu7TPx9hW7sXNH5TKVZbw", "user_id": "SU9Kpd6LFGHcg0TUX7XgmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Absolutely Delightful!!! The food, the atmosphere and the people all add to the comforting \"homey-ness\" of this tiny restaurant. The menu has wide assortment of options that change every Tuesday as well as their staples. You can never choose wrong here. I have yet to try their quiche, but it must also be delicious as they were sold out after being open for only 30 minutes.

Holy crap, best Italian I've had. Probably ever. We had the snow crab ravioli with lemon cream sauce and let me tell you, it's the best dish out there! As soon as I tasted it my taste buds went to heaven. It's seriously heaven in your mouth. I'm thinking maybe ordering another one to go.... We also had the classic lasagna and I ate every last bite. It's classically amazing. The place is adorable and extremely family friendly. Everyone's referring to one other on a first name basis. The portions are perfect as that's all you need. They don't overstuff you like chain restaurants. It's amazing home style Italian food and you need to come try it. My date literally just said \"That's the most amazing meal I've had in my entire life\"......and I cook for him all the time."}, {"review_id": "FpIECoR6eoYRf0fwhvUbuA", "user_id": "OpYv0CfmAwfz8FsxRvuQBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Amazing food!

I'm new to the area and I'm so happy I found this gem. I do a lot of to-go's but the outside patio is adorable. Try the meatloaf sandwich, chicken pot pie, Italian sausage and mushroom lasagna, and if they have the occasional special chicken meatballs...GET THEM! I recommend this place to everyone I talk to.

I have to say I was a tad disappointed. Not because the food didn't taste good, it just didn't taste great. All of the reviews had really set high expectations. But it wasn't just the food, it was also the crowded ambience, the strong smell of fried food in the air, the lack of seating space, and the frazzled (and kinda unfriendly) gentleman who was running the show. One thing I found annoying is that you pay after they've taken your order, so you have to go stand back in line. It just makes sense to pay right up front when you order first. Because the person who was taking the orders kept running back-and-forth between the cash and the kitchen, we waited 10 minutes to place our order and another 10 minutes to pay. I do like the fact that most of their entrées come with a soda and a side salad. Overall, it was pretty good but nothing that blew my mind."}, {"review_id": "haUaNigpNo_pXJtyr419GA", "user_id": "AUfXBOs1xR4CI8ehW2Bv9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "This place is off the charts AMAZING!!!!!Anything you get here is delicious!  The grapevine covered patio is delightful as well!  Don't let the size of the location fool you, this place is a treasure!"}, {"review_id": "tH0u5hZOtWLtwWWyy17fEA", "user_id": "YXz1LkAJJrJxS50QQ0kAsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "This is an interesting place.  The owner said that it was initially a catering business that they expanded because so many people wanted to eat in the shop.  The eating area is quite small, just a few tables and some bar seating.  You order at a counter, where they display the dishes that are basically already prepared.  There are many options. They finish whatever you order, by heating it and maybe adding more sauce, and bring it to your table.  Plate comes with a small salad and some garlic bread (pro-tip, they will give you more bread if you finish your bread).  I had one of the three types of lasagna and it was really good.  Tasty, meaty, savory, spicy...all the best ways to be.  The salad and bread were nice.  The portions are the size you would get if you were eating dinner at home, so no massive chain restaurant sizes of bland food, just the right amount of good food.  Prices were decent.  The service was super friendly, good people run this business.  My coworker, who tends to enjoy safe, bland places normally, liked it here as well.  They also have many, many delicious desserts.  All homemade.  Thumbs up.Sidenote:  there is no bathroom here, but if you ask, they will let you use the bathroom at the shop next door."}, {"review_id": "2DNcsLtHWegy-sW0lO6HJg", "user_id": "jkBzSMPMVfzAgV4XqYzVMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/26/2017", "text": "Stopped in for a quick lunch; I was in and out in 30 minutes. I was looking for something different; yelped what's near me this came up (5 star rating) and I have driven by all the time can't miss the wash board lady on vista :) Think walking into your grandma's/mom's kitchen the smells, the laughter, the joy, and the home cooked meals. That's what you get at cucina di paolo; I was warmly greeted at the counter. They have a huge menu full of traditional favorites including 14 different kinds of lasagna as well as their weekly/daily  specials (they huge coolers displaying it all as well as their huge homemade dessert selection). I went with the traditional beef and sausage lasagna comes with a side salad choice of one their house made dressings. The lasagna came out piping hot; lots of lasagna is loaded with ricotta cheese not this one. The lasagna had great flavor and lots of beef/sausage. I was full..it's a little bit on the higher end for a lunch spot that's to be expected for it being home cooked. The owners/husband cooks and she is front of the house. They know their regulars all by name and the lady is super funny I haven't laughed that much in a long time at a restaurant.if you are looking for some home cooked deliciousness this is the spot."}, {"review_id": "CfN4p7aPmO1FonuwYCaFrQ", "user_id": "8s40EGb-BZkqQokGBeJltw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Love Cucina di Paolo.

Mary Jean is a rockstar at making you feel welcome and can describe the menu in a way that encourages you to want to try everything; right now! Paul's chef skills are undeniable. His recipes belong on the menu of a Michelin star restaurant. They both are personable and friendly to all customers and orchestrate a flawless kitchen symphony. We ate lasagna, seafood ravioli, 2 different clam chowders, hearty salads with crusty bread that is exceptionally delicious and high quality. We ordered dessert to go (Mary Jean makes many wonderful choices), plus a lasagna to take home and bake. Cucina di Paolo needs to be on your list of stops. Too much personality to be missed.  Beware....there is limited seating. Feel free to order take out or call ahead and pick up.

These were all on the specials menu, so they may not be there if you go, depending on the day. The hostess said they're lasagna is the best, but I didn't try it.

So... I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. I oftentimes drive by it and it has great reviews. For the longest time, I saw the little mechanical lady outside washing clothes and thought this was a laundry mat, but it's clearly not. I also didn't know the size of the place. I made dinner reservations for 4. There are only about 12 seats in the whole place. They do have an outdoor patio area, but it was 2 degrees when i went so it didn't really work for me. Is this place an overwhelming 5 start-- not exactly. I would wholeheartedly give it four stars, but the way I felt inside, and the way I left, was so euphoric that I am compelled to give 5 stars because of my experience! Walking in-- WHOA! It's soooo small. Only one table and two bar stools and table top areas. I had no idea it was so small, but it worked. Basically this is more of a come get your food cold, take it home, and warm it up type of place. The ordering was confusing for me. There are food cases with their food on display that has already been made, or ready to go home with you, and then heated up. Not all food it in there, so you have to look at the chalkboard menu (super cute) as to this weeks specials. The other case has amazing looking desserts. This place is owned and operated by a husband and wife team. The wife makes all the desserts and runs the show and the husband cooks the food. They are both amazing people and you feel love when you walk in, when you eat, and when you leave. The love is all in the food. The food itself is very good. I am a big guy and like big portions, and was expecting more, but it was very flavorful and filling-- I had room for the desert (which I never do) and I am sooo glad that I did! I had the peanut butter cheesecake.We were celebrating a birthday and the wife came out with a desert, a candle, and had the whole place sing... usually I'd be embarrassed, but this was too cute. She kept lighting the candle and having my partner blow out the candle over and over and over til there was no longer a match! We all laughed and had a great time. The people make this place-- it's more than food. I encourage you to try it. I can't wait to go back again."}, {"review_id": "ag7xoD2ciwLTpkU4oTuUOQ", "user_id": "3eW7UO385jgTXagk1dgfDA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/31/2018", "text": "Amazing! There are so many emotions that we experienced here that words cannot express. It is not a large restaurant. It's quaint and the owners make you feel like family. The fantastic executive chef talked to us the whole time he was cooking our meal for us as we watched him work his magic. We ordered the chicken Parmesan over a bed of noodles and the chicken and mozzarella ravioli's. The first bite was expectedly The best bite of Italian food ever experienced. Everything was pure perfection down to the last Drop. I would've licked the bowl if I knew no one was watching. Everything is made from scratch and cooked to order. The menu is unbelievably advanced and offers some of the most unique items. We have eaten around the country and this is by far the best. You also can call and he will make you just about any lasagna you can think up to take home and bake yourself. He of course will bake it too! His wonderful wife came over and talk to us after we finished devouring our food. It felt like we were eating in their home. She also makes pot pies to take and bake. Can't wait to see how it's going to taste. If you want to experience tasting the best Italian food ever this is a must trust me you will not regret it. He has weekly specials and a regular menu. You can find the specials online.
