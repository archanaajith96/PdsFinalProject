This small establishment can be found in the Winn-Dixie plaza on St. Johns Bluff and Beach Blvd. THE PLACE: Small, homey. It's a nice feeling! I will say, they have interesting hours, so if you're craving some island food, be sure to either call or look on Google to make sure you don't go when they are closed (because I have done this on multiple occasions).THE FOOD: Love. Love. Love. - Spam Musubi: It's large, which isn't a bad thing. I believe, traditionally, in Hawai'i, the Musubis tend to be smaller. The Musubi at Marianas taste amazing, especially when paired with a finadeni (sp?) sauce, which is a tad spicy. So if you like spicy and Musubis, you should try this out next time. - Beef Empanada: Delicious! It comes with this sauce, I forget what it's called. But, it adds a nice touch to the Empanada- Loco Moco: Oh yes... For as many times as I've been here, I always get the Loco Moco because it tastes so good! I personally like getting the burger patty cooked medium with an over-easy egg on top. Laying on a bed of rice, the dish is lathered in gravy - YUM! I personally like to add Tobasco sauce (or Sriracha Tobasco sauce) and furikaki to the dish. The dish also comes with a side of macaroni salad, which is traditional I believe. The macaroni salad is great!The above mentioned dishes are my personal favorite. I've tried bites of other dishes and they were also really good! Staff is really friendly - again, it's family owned! So, they are very family-oriented. TL;DR: It's good. Eat here. If you like Loco Mocos and Spam Musubis, you won't be disappointed. This spot TOTALLY beats L&L Hawaiian Grill."}, {"review_id": "vcOvtZ_EZMAAa4pNaQMh5g", "user_id": "uhWw6uUXJcP8-nwQqzfAkA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "I tried Marianas Grinds for the first time today and enjoyed everything I ate.

I was greeted very warmly by the owner who seated me. From the vibe alone, I can tell I was seated among tables of returning customers. Even as they piled through the doors, the owners knew them all by name. If that's not a good omen, I don't know what is.I ordered lumpia and the short rib combo plate that came with fried rice and mac salad. The lumpia was very much consistent with every bite and with every roll. It was like biting into one of my mom's freshly fried lumpias from back home. The short ribs had an interesting red chili pepper flake sauce that was different, but delicious all the same. Mac salad also had a hint of tuna, which I wasn't expecting. I'm usually a big fan of the sweet mac (usually made with a hint of pineapple), but this mac was another good change. Portions were on the smaller end, but I still left with my belly full and with to-go boxes to enjoy later.Overall, what I can tell what gets customers to return is the heartfelt customer service along with their ono grindz. I can't wait to come back to try their saimen next."}, {"review_id": "1i_eGDSRqj-TfYv96kPKtw", "user_id": "orw19P3hwunieFN3DZEZRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Great food.

The owners and staff are very friendly. The food was freshly made. I couldn't make up my mind on which meet so they made me both. Chicken teriyaki, tropical rice, eggs, sausage and veggies.

We ordered the short ribs, ginisan katne(beef with veggies) like a stir fry, and tried their pancit, lumpia(spring roll) and their bbq chicken stick. All were amazing. This is food from Guam. The pancit noodles tasted quite different than I'm use to. But I'm use to Filipino pancit and the lumpia - Filipino spring roll was great!I loved the atmosphere of this quite little island getaway and the service was excellent. Hopefully o can be back here soon!"}, {"review_id": "LRQp4kIl-Ffqb7tb09OYNg", "user_id": "fr1Hz2acAb3OaL3l6DyKNg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "One of my recommended this place after we have diner. We decided to try it because it is difficult for us to visit Jacksonville. This is interesting place because they have islands cuisine from Guam. So we want to try their appetizer. We start with their grill chicken sticks with honey and sweet Hawaiian sauce. It is good to have the BBQ stick to started. Then we have the shrimp patty. This patty is made of flour with chop up and dice up shrimp. It go with the sauce to dip for the taste. It is different than many shrimp patty I have. The last but not the least is the lumpia. This is actually Pilipino cuisine. Not too many people visit them at that night. Many take out. I would said the food is good. Try to support the local business is difficult if not get too many traffic out of visitors. Service is good."}, {"review_id": "ykunnNk5n1uE-VqkUX2JBQ", "user_id": "AMrhEi4bLvaAcC2XggeBsg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "This is my favorite Filipino restaurant in Jacksonville.

That was me yesterday. I found this gem when looking for new breakfast / brunch spots and the spam fried rice definitely lured me there like an ice cream truck would start the frenzy of little children. Unfortunately no spam fried rice on a Sunday, they had a special menu which did not disappoint! At first we were ordering to go since there was a wait, but upon receiving our to-go order, the staff was hospitable enough to let us sit down and enjoy our brunch, AND still help us, though we already paid for it! We order meal number one and 2B which was enough for left overs for today! I literally could of died happy since I was extremely blown away. We also ordered a side of lumpia, which to be honest is better than mine! Altogether everything was a bit pricey but you pay for quality!The reason why I was brought to tears is that they had a whole grilled pork and the lechon brought me memories of my childhood, in turn, bringing on the waterworks. Plus it helps that the environment was cozy and the staff made it feel like you're family. Upon leaving, Josie, she is the sweetest!, started cleaning and saw the extra tip we left. She did a double take, asked if we intended to leave it there, and proceeded with hugging us. Mariana Grinds, you've earned yourself a new loyal customer! Keep doing what you're doing and I can't wait to come back!"}, {"review_id": "AuN7B6ePxcGwEW5to_Zpyg", "user_id": "04teBLyRjndbv5_LsGcrBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/27/2017", "text": "Came here for a quick bite before an appointment and SO GLAD I did !!Even though I wasn't a big money ticket with my small selection of Empenada and bbq chicken stick the owner was so nice and made me feel as if I was truest at home talking with family as I waited for my take out order I will DEFINITELY be returning the quick bite was delicious and filling!!

This place was recommended by a friend and we are satisfied customers! I just want to rave on their delicious Ginisan Katne! It was soooo good and bursting with flavors! Tried looking it up on google so I can make one by myself but can't find the recipe! Anyways, it was so good with rice! My husband ordered Teriyaki chicken and it was awesome as well. We also tried their Spam Musubi, taste like any other spam musubi but the sauce makes the difference! Also sampled their Chicken and Pork barbecue, both were cooked to perfection! Tender and flavorful! Yum!

I got the Kahlua Pork special which was a bit pricey at 15.99 but was delicious.

The Kelaguen (have it cold) and the MY fried rice with Portuguese sausage were real stand-outs!

I knew it was the perfect time to visit when a friend who love spam came to town.Walking in on a Friday night, the place was moderately full with small families that were enjoying the casual and relaxed environment. Greeted very warmly by one of the owners, we were seated quickly and she reviewed the nightly specials and highlights of the menu. All of the prices seemed very reasonable.We ordered lumpia and spam musubi to start, as well as the fried pork chop and Island style short ribs with macaroni salad and fiesta rice as our entrées. As we waited for our food, I glanced around the small restaurant which was decorated in a no-frills way with wood paneling, pictures of the islands, and destination signs.Our appetizers came out quickly and we dove into the lumpia. They were perfectly cooked with an excellent crispy exterior and adequate filling on the inside. Unfortunately the musubi was less successful for me. I'm used to the variety on the Hawaiian Islands where the spam is marinated before being placed on top of the rice cake and wrapped in nori. This one lacked any flavor but the sauces that we had for the lumpia and others that they brought us were more than adequate to enhance the flavor of the spam.Seasoning was certainly not an issue with the island short ribs. The sweet sauce that the ribs were bathed in was so delicious that I could've eaten it just by itself. Adding the sauce to the flavorless fiesta rice really made that more palatable. The last thing on my plate was the macaroni salad. I am not a lover of mayonnaise so there are very few macaroni salads that I really love and this was not one of them.The food for the most part was very good but the hospitality was even better. It felt like we had stopped by to eat in a friend's home for a casual dinner. They checked on us, replenished our utensils and napkins, chatted with us about the restaurant, and they expressed their appreciation for our visit. You just don't get that at chain restaurants."}, {"review_id": "fCKtBLlFelvhSYaneGZ5DA", "user_id": "muysKWzC8cF8id4hhMy0Qw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "Wonderful plate lunch and \"local\" grinds, and Spam Musubi!
