Came here after my Half Marathon - therefore, I was starving. Everything I had was delicious and I pigged out! Lol, guess running a Half definitely gives you an excuse to eat like 2 entrees, haha. *Make sure to leave your name up front. They will text you once they're ready for you. I came at like 1:30pm and it was popping! Had to wait 30 mins. Service was really good. I suppose it has to be so that folks can be moved in and out. Food: Mac and Cheese with Hot Chicken - Took awhile to come out BUT was 100% worth it. HUGE portions. Mac and Cheese was GREAT! The real thing to try is the Hot Chicken. Very delicious. Nomnom. You can take this home too if you ordered too much. OR this could be a great meal for 1 if you're randomly here and hungry and by yourself. Meat Pizza - Man, this hit the spot. Pretty big pizza for 1 person. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Everything on it was super tasty. I'm drooling as I think about it now. The dough was cooked very well! I could tell what all they added in a single bite. My friend ordered the bigger salad... thing was MASSIVE. Definitely order the smaller size if you have several dishes ordered."}, {"review_id": "yZHjeKloZFO6rktZxo_0cw", "user_id": "OaUuyDXBZ8Qe6gpRVNqAlQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I went to The Stillery tonight with two friends for dinner. There was no one at the hostess stand and no one greeted us letting us know that the hostess would be right with us. When she finally arrived she was very sweet. We were seated at a booth in the back by the kitchen and bathroom which I found very odd because we had a reservation, I expected a much better table. Our server Marissa was very sweet, attentive and super accommodating when I changed my mind after ordering. Drinks were delicious! I ordered the Jack Float and my friends ordered the Blueberry Smash. I ordered the mac and cheese with hot chicken, it was just okay. Tasted good but nothing special. My biggest critique was the temperature of the restaurant. It was FREEZING. We could barely enjoy ourselves because of it. We are in town for just three days and there's definitely better dining options in Nashville."}, {"review_id": "sfGUDVYpX1K8HkQ55JA8JA", "user_id": "eRQtjtV-15kanF2aRoy9Pg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Hands down the best southern food I've ever had. Our last day in Tennessee meant we had to find the best possible place to eat. Yelp assisted once again in finding this incredible establishment. We arrived and were told it was a 25-30min wait, but I had no issue with that given how well reviewed this place was. So we walked around Nashville until it was time to eat. 25-30min wait was a bargain. The food here is phenomenal, and my family was just as impressed as I was. I ordered a noted menu favorite in the hot chicken tenders. The waiter suggested to get the Nashville hot sauce on the side so I did. The sauce on the tenders was great, but the Nashville hot sauce was amazing. I didn't think I could finish such a large meal, but I had to because it was just that good (it's a generous amount of chicken and fries). Their fries are delicious and fresh, and they paired well with the tenders. My family ordered the steak sandwiches with a side of mac and cheese, and for two people who aren't fans of Mac and cheese, they devoured it. They couldn't stop praising how amazing it all was. I was completely blown away in all aspects of food and service, and honestly, I'd go back to Nashville just for this if I could. It's a must try for anyone who enjoys food."}, {"review_id": "do9_bnBuK2wTtSdvnHXPSQ", "user_id": "wLRP1iW4aA1diW3Uvt2pGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Looking to dine, then plan on a wait....... however, it'll be worth it.

My dining partner ate healthily, ordering the Strawberry Gorgonzola salad. They logged it as near perfect. Myself, being not so healthy, went with the Hot Chicken Two-Handed sandwich, and it lived up to its name.

It was packed Saturday night but we were determined to wait it out for a table. We also wanted to listen to live music so we headed upstairs to stake out a table. After waiting for almost an hour we were able to put two small tables together. We also had a perfect location to the stage. The food is a mix of Southern comfort food and elevated bar food. I ordered a pepperoni pizza to split with a friend. My pizza was ok; very greasy. I did try some other dishes (perk to group dining). I especially enjoyed the Hot Chicken mac and cheese. They also specialize in cocktails served in mason jars which were a fun twist. The live music was really good. The main reason I gave this 3 1/2 Stars was the service. We were told it was first come first serve upstairs and they were swamped. We understood them being swamped for a Saturday night but the staff did not seem prepared. We were waiting for a long table and after almost an hour (and several staff walking by us) we were told that the long table was reserved. I wish we were told sooner, it was frustrating waiting for a table that we did not know was reserved. However once we found tables, the food and music made up for the wait."}, {"review_id": "vLALf1bhUtNA1iUlTWW3Zg", "user_id": "gJFC6DaM5guitce6FSFYxw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Local beers selections were good.

The baked cheese was delicious. Specially marinara sauce which is not too salty. We sat at the bar so we did not have to wait for the seat for 30-40 mins. But our bartender forgot my mayo and sriracha sauce after I repeated asking for them. Overall we probably will be back to try their Sriracha Devil eggs and different pizza.  Sad part..

There is a really long wait usually so be prepared for that. What happened was we put our name in and then we adventured around Nashville. It was supposed to be an hour and a half wait but ended up only being an hour, plus they texted us when the table was readyWhen we got there, we weren't sure what to get. I got the tomato and pesto pizza pie and the mac & cheese with hot chicken. My friend and I split them both. The food was so good, and I highly recommend both of those dishes. The food is not TOO expensive, but it isn't cheap either.At first our waitress was a bit rude, but for some reason she got a lot nicer about halfway through the dinner. They also had a really good sweet tea and lemonade. All in all, I live in the area and would definitely come again. I would say to come, put your name in, then explore the area. Great find. We stayed on the first floor, but there are three floors, and each has a different vibe. The first floor is just a chill dining area.

We had the brussel sprout appetizer, pizza, mac and cheese with Nashville chicken and Nashville chicken fingers, plus a few mason jar drinks. Everything came out hot and fresh. The drinks were made great. I did get a drink I didn't care for (didn't realize it was whiskey based) and the waitress took it back and had one made with vodka without me even asking. She realized I did not drink it and asked me if I liked it. We waited about an hour before sitting. We came on Wednesday evening and it is crowded. The Nashville chicken is hot! Mac and cheese is amazing and taste like it's made from scratch. The pizza is nice a crispy bottom and perfectly melted cheesy top.

I was able to get by with the half and was had plenty with that and the appetizer. My pickier son asked for several changes to his burger which they easily accommodated. He had mac n cheese for a side while my other son had fries. We all appreciated the miniature fry basket in which they were served - very quaint and a nice touch!Overall, it was a positive experience. The only drawback was the bathroom, which was a one-seater, wasn't very clean and was out of toilet paper. I actually visited twice and by the second visit they had replaced the roll.

The mac and cheese was super rich, more butter than cheese, but still good and tender pasta. The hot chicken was more mild, but I get it, they didn't have a heat scale option, so you can't have a bunch of people sending back dishes because it was too hot.
