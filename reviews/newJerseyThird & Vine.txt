BUT, now I'm back and Third & Vine is 5-star material and I got to see and taste it for myself.Came here for cocktails, wine, and CHEESE. It was phenomenal. The service, the stinkers, the wine, and gin cocktail that gave me a killer hangover the next day. All of it. This is gonna be one of my regular spots."}, {"review_id": "ZRYuMVvCR7ZXAKg3eNBDzg", "user_id": "n603jStpVCe5ex3kxOmfnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Update - 05/18Not sure what's happened to 3&V but not the same  bar it once was. Still a good place to find a good cheese board in JC (a bit less varied last time I went) but lacking a certain something it used to have. They've also attempted to branch out a good bit beyond a good cocktail/wine and cheese board with specials like Taco Tuesday which was never really the style of the place. Let's see how it continues to play out, hopefully get some of the old charm back."}, {"review_id": "Fgj74u98AkSDqgV6QPxXAQ", "user_id": "-A6ENKeDFHJfo9JEXRTh6w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Went here on a Saturday night around 8:30pm. We called a little after 8pm to see if there would be a wait for a party of 2 and they let us know we would be able to sit immediately. When we arrived, there were others at each communal table, but it wasn't packed by any means. Liked the dimly lit atmosphere and chill vibe from the start. The glass case full of cheese in the middle of the restaurant was pretty cool too!We started off each with a glass of wine (pinot noir and Beaujolais). We ordered 4 cheeses (one from each section on the menu - blues, stinkers, semi firm to hard, and soft/creamy), which were all served with accompaniment. The blue was served with nutella, the stinky funkmeister with mushrooms, the creamy cheese with dried cranberries and pata cabra with a red pepper jelly. These were served with a basket of sliced italian bread. All of the cheese paired perfectly with the little side. I was a little hesitant about blue and nutella together, but wow the blue balanced out the sweet hazelnut completely. We also got smoked duck and sorpressata (both served with spicy mustard). After the charcuterie board, we got a few 3 more dishes. First up, 3 deviled eggs (normal, roasted garlic , and caesar). These were some of the best deviled eggs I've had..would like to come back to try others! Beef and pork meatballs were next. These were served on top of polenta and with ricotta. Neither the meatballs nor the polenta had a ton of flavor so probably the least favorite dish. Lastly, we tried the cauliflower \"risotto\" that had some spring veggies mixed in. Loved this!Will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "lMk4WTkgRIH0rpGnSodFFA", "user_id": "2FjdJEBZA0RWcoJ53tJT_w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "OMG SO GOOD! everything was delicious from the unique cocktails, the grilled cheese, deviled eggs, cauliflower risotto, beet salad, and eggplant fries.

The food is incredible now when it used to be OK..and the wine list is perfect. It's a little pricey, but so worth the night out. We went there expecting just to have a drink or two and we had dinner there. The quail was so good and the salmon app was perfectly fresh. Glad we gave it another chance.

I was so happy that the environment was calm, relaxed, and comfortable. The staff were friendly and attentive to our needs.

I was very disappointed.We ordered a bunch of dishes: deviled eggs, stuffed peppers, flatbread, braised pork belly, mac & cheese, bacon maple cheesecake and warm chocolate cake. There was supposed to be another dish but the waiter forgot to punch it in. My favorite was the deviled eggs, which were perfectly seasoned. Stuffed peppers were pretty interesting, which was peppers wrapped with bacon.It was very weird that the waiter kept waving his arms when he wanted to get our attention.Overall, I had a mixed feeling of this place and am not sure if I will ever go back again."}, {"review_id": "AdXzO1qYlU0UxjB1STKUPA", "user_id": "H7IcW5jwxp4eRDvDb-HytQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2018", "text": "We were there last night (Saturday). Got there around 8:30pm and the place was buzzing in a good way. The noise level was just about right- loud enough to know folks were enjoying the evening and yet not too loud; we could have a conversation without having to shout. The vibe was excellent and very welcoming. Shared high tables style seating and the high chairs with backs (thankfully not backless stools)was appropriate for this classy wine and cheese place. It's a great addition to the \"village\" neighborhood of Jersey City, close as it is to White Eagle Hall and Madame Claude's and other nice spots. As one would expect the the wine selection is excellent and expertly matched the food. The deviled eggs were fantastic and lived up to the hype. The meatballs, stuffed peppers, pork belly were all excellent.  Sadly, we were so full we never got to try their cheese selection but will certainly be back. Go ahead and visit - you won't regret it, in fact by not going you are missing out."}, {"review_id": "rE75-QjlwW4l1VH5oHSsoQ", "user_id": "46Wi08T5D3phf3SMgi7U3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/2/2017", "text": "You won't find many places like this around. It's a bit fancy and a bit expensive, but well worth it. This is the first restaurant that I've been to that has its own Fromager (I knew there was a fancier way to say cheese expert). Thinking about where to go on your next date? This is your place: dimly lit, small plates and an interesting drink menu make you feel right at home. Each time we've been, we've ordered a cheese board with a trio of cheeses and unique pairings. On our last visit, they paired a blue cheese with white chocolate shavings dusted in hibiscus - something I would've never thought of, but it worked...really well. Other things not to overlook include the beef, pork and ricotta meatballs served with creamy polenta and tomato basil sauce. My girlfriend has had the American grilled cheese (4 domestic cheeses) and described it as being served on a Texas-toast like bread with a delicious blend of cheeses. Craving a cocktail? Why not refresh with the Orleans Spritz. Maybe bourbon is more your thing? Try Pop-Pop's Old Fashion. Sip, enjoy and repeat. On a Friday night, it's not terribly crowded and you never go long without an empty drink or a visit from your server asking if everything is ok - something that can be hard to come by in the city. The food, drinks and service have always been top notch, which is why I give them a solid five. P.S. Don't look for a sign as they like to stay inconspicuous without one"}, {"review_id": "AHTiBmmwzYY-bNs6NPz6LQ", "user_id": "w2ntisggCzwnu_EuCIZz2g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/19/2017", "text": "On a Friday night a few weeks ago, I arrived a little early - 15 to 20 mins before the rest of our party and tried to get someone's attention.  When i finally flagged down the waitress/host, she said that i would need to wait till everyone was at the restaurant.  The table by the door was open, so i just took a seat, and waited.  Not once while i sat there did anyone ask if i wanted a drink, some water or anything. That seemed to set a tone for the evening when it came to service.For food, we had ordered a number of items - I really liked to mac and cheese.  The meatballs were also good, and so was the flatbread.Service unfortunately didn't improve during the meal, and the staff just didn't seem interested.Overall an ok experience.  Not a place i would return to anytime soon."}, {"review_id": "3eZ3qvqKvINMHYlYRu-5eQ", "user_id": "4vavTfDI0A2Dc3xlowx2Rg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/11/2017", "text": "Third & Vine is located on a quieter, more residential block of downtown JC. Just look for the very 'wood' exterior and you've found it. Inside you'll step into a very cozy space with a bar, several communal tables, and a proudly-displayed cheese case.  Once inside, expect warm, friendly service and a unique wine & tapas experience. Be prepared for a dimly-lit environment, no sports on the one television, relaxing music playing. It's an absolute escape. The wines we had were very good, a generous pour, maybe a tad expensive.  The menu has many indulgent offerings; we ignored the salad selections and went for the Croque Madame, beef/pork/ricotta meatballs over polenta,  stuffed peppers (wrapped with bacon) and slices of smoked duck (smoked in house). I'd recommend any of the four. Third & Vine is one of those unique businesses that does everything their own way and does it well.  I look forward to going again and I promise not to be late."}, {"review_id": "Nim8ERojaxX22OLQ9DyRhg", "user_id": "6HiQQYZYhAjSmAuX89abNA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/26/2017", "text": "I've been here a few times already, and a review is past due. This is one of my wife and my favorite spots on either side of the Hudson. It's really good and the people who run the place are committed to good food and good drink.Arugula, beet and goat cheese salad with hazelnuts~ classic and well executed. Crispness of the arugula, earthiness and color of the beets, creaminess of the goat cheese, sweetness of the hazelnut, love it. Mixed into it was a vinegar based dressing that tied it together nicely.Pickled vegetables~ love how they pickle vegetables; rhubarb, carrots, cauliflower, etc. Pickling foods sounds like an easy thing to do, but not all pickled foods are created equal. And 3rd and Vine's is more equal than others.Escabeche~ really cool plating, with the escabeche inside of a sardine-type of tin. Taste to match the presentation.Braised pork belly w/slaw~ probably the only true gripe of this place; the slaw is quite salty on its own, though it tastes great with the pork belly. Tastes kind of southern BBQ-y which is fine with me.Cheese and meats~ solid selection of cheeses, not to mention a pretty cool looking cheese display in the dining area. We more or less asked our waitress to recommend a couple and so I can't remember what they were. All I remember was that they were good. Give 'em a try, you'll love this place."}, {"review_id": "ouDD-21b7Uct_RPMZIr50A", "user_id": "315oZrk4VLV-IX57fwmYvA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "Everyone knows this place has great wine and cheeses, but I went there last night to just grab a drink with friends and am so happy we decided to get food too.  Had the spring (or garden, I don't remember) flatbread and the zucchini app....omg sooooooo good.  The seasoning on the zucchini and the sauce were so tasty and the crust on the flatbread was perfection.  Big big fan and will definitely be back for more drinks and more food."}, {"review_id": "dKFMQ9ToKo-qCHr4KkN5yw", "user_id": "WDC7laCs6BByZdC7whM8OA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "Great place for wine and cheese!

We also ordered the meatballs with polenta (mmmm!) and the amazing butternut squash risotto cake! Soooo good!! The chocolate molten cake is a winner too!! Our server was great too.
