I used to work in the Chinatown-International District and would always go here at least once every other week. I no longer work nearby but sometimes if I work from home I get to go. I used to only go if I had someone else to go with because sometimes the wait is long. Well.... I no longer care.The last time I was here, I went by myself and got in and got out. I ordered the muffo sandwich with a meatball to go... this place is always good and never disappoints me. The line is worth the wait and if you're able to go at 10:45 am... go. I read on here that you can order online and skip straight ahead in line to pay and get out the door real quick. I'll definitely need to try this option for when I am hankering for some meat, cheese, and bread.Even though I am willing to blow my budget on eating at Salumi, it's worth it. Any foodie or fool will tell you. I love that this place is a Seattle staple and the day Salumi closes is the day Seattle is dead to me."}, {"review_id": "pODqTO8C6d7SBgWg5waajA", "user_id": "aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "We came by at 1230pm for lunch on a Wednesday and there was no line! Since it was my first time here I was a bit confused by the menu. I didn't know what the menu items were or what to order. 4 items were already sold out at this time. I tried to ask one of the people making the sandwiches what she would recommend and she just gave us some salami to sample. I then tried to ask what the seasonal salami was and she didn't seem to understand and asked the guy next to her. She just started making a salami sandwich for my sister and then I ordered the meatball and that was it. We weren't asked if it were for here or to go, it is served differently. I can't help but feel like I missed something.The sandwiches are more expensive than average but they're also huge. The bread on the meatball was a bit crunchy on the outside but so soft inside. The meatballs were amazing. Tender and juicy. The salami sandwich of unknown flavor was also good. The mozzarella helped elevate this sandwich.The neighborhood is really sketchy even in daytime. I would not walk around here alone. This is one reason this restaurant would not be on my regular rotation."}, {"review_id": "3-5IkaGPHcyvJt9piQw7JA", "user_id": "VTt2T2JLTGf6tA6vm-lcvQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "Usually there is a line out the door so I have avoided having lunch here for three years. But on this day I walked in to find just three other people ordering. I was torn between a meatball sandwich and a salami sandwich or one of their specialty sandwich. I chose the meatball sandwich with provolone, peppers and onions. The bread was rubbed with garlic butter and three large meatballs were topped with marinara and provolone. The sandwich was so big I was glad to see them cut it in half and chose to share it with my coworker.With a large stash of napkins in hand I began my journey into devouring my half of the meatball sandwich. The meatballs were huge so I had to hold the sandwich together with a firm grip/squish kind of method. The marinara sauce was what you expect your Italian grandmother to make and the meatballs were meaty and packed with flavor. The bread was chewy and crusty and the addition of he garlic butter was perfect but if the sandwich sits to long the bread will become mushy. Adding the peppers and onions is a must.Next time, crowd willing, I will try the other sandwiches."}, {"review_id": "vTbr92twRCAYRdGzfybxBA", "user_id": "QEqHKXoD61jM_Cd6RZuqZQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/27/2018", "text": "Have you ever walked into a place and just underestimated just how good it will really be? This place exceeded my expectations. I had this place bookmarked and had just skimmed through the reviews. My boyfriend and I wanted to grab some lunch after we finished up at the Seattle Passport office. And lucky for us, we were super close by. We walked over from where we parked (seriously, parking around here is not easy) and it was easy enough to find. The area isn't the best, and the restaurant is super small. We got there around 11:30 AM on a Monday. It's only take out on Mondays apparently. All the stools and chairs were still up. The menu only has a couple of sandwich choices along with some daily specials. I decides on the meatball while the boy got the porchetta. Service was super friendly and efficient. We both got fresh mozzarella on our sandwiches, and I also got peppers and onions on mine, because why not? I was immediately jealous when I saw what DJ got. It smells and looks so amazing. You can just taste the amount of flavor that's in that sandwich by smelling it. We paid and drove home to eat.The porchetta was hands down the best sandwich of the two. The flavor was INCREDIBLE. Seriously, I need to know how they make it. The bread they use is a perfect little pocket. It's a good bread that makes it hard for any of the pork to fall out. I will say, it's pretty greasy. The meatball was fantastic. Again, flavor was spot on. It's huge (like everyone else said, 3 huge meatballs in your sandwich) And the fresh mozzarella is a perfect complement. Honestly, just add the fresh mozzarella to all of their sandwiches. This blew our expectations out of the water. The reviews live up to this place. Now I know where to take out of town visitors now to get the best sandwiches. Parking is a pain. We parked in a lot .2 miles away and it was $12 bucks an hour. But these sandwiches are worth it."}, {"review_id": "_7u1Eaf1mkX4pBKn5Iw69A", "user_id": "YQ01_0vr9TahbQiBSr69Nw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I finally had a weekday off, so thought best to use it wisely and get my ass on the bus to Seattle where Salumi Artisan Cured Meats is only open on weekdays for lunch.  Living and working on the Eastside - when the heck am I ever gonna visit Salumi?  So, I trekked to the Pioneer Square neighborhood for this famous spot.I arrived a little after 11am, which is when Salumi opens and was prepared for a line out the door...which there was.  However, I will say the line wasn't at all as long as I imagined it would be, and while I was waiting, it went by super fast.   The doorway is very narrow, so you can't really see the chalkboard menu until you're inside.  But even then - to speed the line up, as soon as the butchers see you - they will ask what you want.  So, I turned to the guy behind me, asked if he had been before, which he responds with, \"tons\", giving me the go-ahead to ask him what he recommended for a first-timer.  Friendly Stranger responds with, \"the Porchetta Sandwich in the Pocket Bread.\"  He points to the pocket bread where I see the official name is Giuseppe.  Let's do it. I ordered what I was told.  The butcher made the sandwich very quickly, making sure to slit the Giuseppe bread, to form a pocket where he placed the porchetta meat inside, drippings and all.  MMMM HMMM.  Then he asked if I wanted onions and peppers with, which I did, and asked if I'm dining in or doing take-out.  I was handed my sandwich where I paid at the end of the line with the separate cashier.  It's a speedy system to alleviate the long line, consisting mostly of those who work nearby and tourists.Before I visited I heard Salumi was very small, so seating was really limited.  Fortunately though, many of the customers were getting take-out, which allowed a spot to open at the only long table available.  So just note that if you plan to dine-in, especially with a group, you may not get a seat. But on to what you're really reading this for - the Porchetta Sandwich.  Yes, it's good and yes, did I hate myself for eating carbs; but it's certainly worth trying if you have never done so before.  In fact, most Seattle-must-eat guides will mention any sandwich from Salumi will do, but the Porchetta, when the Oxtail isn't available, is the one to try if you haven't already.  The pork was very flavorful, as it was clearly having been slow-roasted for hours in its juices, making it all the more tender and good.  There were also some Italian spices to it, that I couldn't quite put my finger on, but it worked really, really well.  I recommended getting it with the optional peppers and onions, which were also roasted and tasty.  The pocket bread was especially a good fit for this sandwich because my favorite part of eating this was towards the bottom of the bread, where the drippings were!  Oh my goodness was it tasty!  It was like a nice au jus for damn good bread.  Honestly, I could've eaten the bread on its own and called it a day, but when soaked in the porchetta juice, it just makes life a little more grand.  Best, best, best part of the sandwich by far.  I also liked that the bread was slightly toasted, so everything was all nice and warm once you bit into the sandwich.  Was it the best sandwich I've had in Seattle?  Quite possibly, but I can't say it's a favorite.  It's good, but I don't believe it stood to the test of hype.  Like you, I'd really like to try the Oxtail which is only available on certain days; therefore, in reality, I'll never have the chance - but even the cured meats looked really good.  I'll have to work my way through the menu, to find what's my Salumi sandwich.  But overall, glad to have finally visited Salumi for a solid Italian sandwich."}, {"review_id": "CjaPwdDpyHT_-C2PdsEo3w", "user_id": "zb9GH11J7PQDFst7yajSog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "Hell yes!

I arrived at 11:15, which is 15 minutes after opening and the line was out the door, but not wrapped around the corner. I was able to order my food around 11:45, so it took me about 30 minutes in total waiting in line to order a sandwich, which isn't terrible compared to other places. My boyfriend ordered the last \"Salumi Muffo\" sandwich, which basically resembles a Muffaletta sandwich. The main components are the olive tapenade, hot sopressata, and provolone cheese. These sandwiches are one of their only non-fresh sandwiches and is made the night before. They do this so the olive juices and herbs can soak into the bread to produce optimal flavor. This sandwich was very good and something I would definitely buy again. I ended up ordering a sandwich with fresh mozzarella and Finnochiona Salami. It was definitely tasty as well. Overall, I would come back here because I want to try some of their other sandwiches that looked amazing.

I proclaim my love for you, Salumi! This place makes the best sandwiches in Seattle. Never mind the daily lines or the limited seating once inside the restaurant. These sandwiches are worth it in spades!I first found out about Salumi in one of Anthony Bourdain's early \"No Reservations\" episodes when he visited Seattle. The cured meats just spoke to me when I watched it on tv. Unfortunately, working on the Eastside back then didn't give me many opportunities to go to Pioneer Square. When I finally took a staycation, I knew where I was going for lunch. From the first time I visited Salumi to my most recent outing to grab the famous Oxtail Sandwich, whatever I order has never been a letdown.The best time to go to Salumi is when they first open at 11am. If you're an impatient person, I would suggest going in the fall or winter during the rainy seasons because most tourists won't stand in the rain. However, they're missing out on the great food inside.  Let's start with the sandwiches. You really can't go wrong with any of them here. If it's your first time, I would recommend one of their hot sandwiches. The Porchetta and Meatball are both amazing! The Porchetta is not your traditional pork roast with crispy pork skin and cracklins. Instead it's a mouth watering stewed pork and they pile giant spoonfuls into the bread. The Meatballs are just as equally stupendous and are literally the size of racquetballs. They are no joke and you get 3 per sandwich. There are 3 types of bread you can choose from: Giuseppe, Sticcole, and French Baguette. The Guiseppe is like Ciabatta bread and is usually the most popular and best for the Porchetta and salami sandwiches while the french baguette is best for the Meatball Sandwiches. Even though most people prefer the Guiseppe bread, I prefer the Sticcole bread when I get the Salami sandwiches. The Sticcole bread is a denser, olive oil bread that has more volume. I just think it goes better with the many varieties of salamis.If you decide to choose to go with a cold sandwich, I would suggest going with the Mole Salami, which has hints of chocolate. Add that to the Sticcole bread with the garlic spread, Mozzarella Cheese (extra charge), and onions and peppers and you've got the perfect sandwich. Want to try multiple salamis on your sandwich? I would recommend the pre-made Muffo, which is their version of the the Muffaletta. Finally, for the foodhunters out there, you'll want to check Twitter or Instagram for when they serve the Oxtail Sandwich. This stewed monstrosity is only served 4-5 times a year and the only way to know about it is through Salumi's account on social media. Trust me, it's worth it to take a 1/2 day from work.If you're not feeling a sandwich, you can always order the daily pasta specials and they serve Gnocchi on Tuesdays. The pastas aren't as good as Il Corvo (then again, who is), but it's still pretty damn good! The last time I ordered the pasta, I got the penne and it was cooked perfectly. Of all the places in Seattle, I probably frequent this place more often per year than any restaurant around. If you're from out of town or a local, this is a must in your itinerary. The food is fantastic and the ambience is just as great."}, {"review_id": "fSZuEQWKeriK9HqhDnVKmg", "user_id": "a2osd_dBVDYaO-kL_Whjng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/18/2017", "text": "For you cured meats needs and sandwiches made with cured meats, there is no better place that I know of than Salumi.

Though its well know for its cured meats, I generally get the porchetta, or one of the other warm sandwiches, though they tend to run out. The porchetta has tons of flavor, with tons of juices that soaks into the sandwich, truly one of the best sandwiches in Seattle. The hot sandwiches do then to run out though so come here early. For the cured meats, I prefer the mole or the hot soppressata and they really lay on a think layer for each sandwich.There is also some daily specials as well, one of which is tends to be a pasta dish, these are always great, it can be anything from gnocchi to lasagna."}, {"review_id": "yebIqpxe6J_bAv7KNq-VBQ", "user_id": "ghNS3F1HD0L9BtIqTmq39A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/5/2018", "text": "OMG!

Note: Pioneer Square is NOT a 'good' neighborhood. As I mentioned in my Biscuit Bitch review, there are a lot of homeless people on the streets. It's scarier than downtown LA. My boyfriend and I had to circle around to find street parking that wasn't too far from Salumi. When we were walking there, a homeless man started yelling at us and threw a piece of trash at us! It was really scary!!!When we safely made it to Salumi, we were informed that they were all out of hot sandwiches for the day. We were disappointed, but understood because it was already 2:30pm. The male worker gave us samples of their different salamis, all of which were tasty. He talked really quietly though so I couldn't really hear what he was saying when he explained the different meats. We decided to share a mole salami on Giuseppe bread (similar to ciabatta). They put some oil/garlic stuff on the bread and some onions (I think they're pickled?). Since it was the end of the day, there weren't that many onions left, which was sad because I love onions and they were really good!  The flavors all meshed well together, though I wished there was lettuce and tomato also (probably not a traditional Italian thing though). Overall, I think it's cool that they make all their salamis/meats there.

Armando Batali has created something truly amazing with his various types of salami, pancetta, and guanciale, some seasonal, and some in regular production throughout the year. My personal favorites are the Agrumi with those citrus and spice notes and the Mole (chocolatey, spicy, smoky). My close friend would have a fit if he knew I went to Salumi and didn't bring back some mole salami for him. The sandwiches are not to be missed, particularly the porchetta and the muffo (their take on the NOLA classic Muffaletta). It's not a highly coveted secret amongst locals anymore, so the lines can be very long. Pre-order your sandwich before they open and you can jump the line.They are limited on how much product they can sell each day, so definitely go early. Unless policies have changed, all sliced meat orders have to be ordered on the same day and before they open. The slicer runs all day, so sliding in an order mid-day is not possible. You can buy whole salami though and they'll hold that for pick-up.If you do get a something to eat, there are a few tables for guests to dine at with self-serve water, and self-serve house wine. The wine is paid by the glass on the honor system. It's communal seating, which is perfect.I absolutely love this place.

The thing is, while the sandwich was very good, it was just a bit blander than I expected -- all the flavors that I thought would jump out (the olive oil spread, the meat, the peppers/onions) worked but didn't really pop.
