No this is straight out of Omaha. I never would have thought I'd find a place like this in Nebraska.Cool restaurant. The place is obviously a huge hit. It was lined up like mad but worth the wait and every penny of the $18 bucks I spent for lunch.The menu is awesome.

The line was out the door, but moved pretty quickly .... we timed it and it was 28 minutes from when we got in line to when our food was brought out. At this restaurant you order at the counter, pay, choose a seat, and they bring out your food. We ordered the duck fun fries, 2 of the Block Burgers, and a few sides of fries. We also tried the truffle mayo and the dragon sauce. Everything we had was yummy but messy. It's greasy, fatty food that leaves you feeling full. This is not a healthy spot, so if your looking for something light, go elsewhere"}, {"review_id": "OasEzuOStMKz5NjCf8bSVw", "user_id": "QEp9lF7oC6JqflFi_rkl-g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Delicious and unbelievably satisfying. Rich, meaty burgers topped with a variety of fresh, saucy, flavorful toppings. What more could you want? My favorite is the classic Block 16 burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup and mustard. I like things simple, and they crush it! If you're looking for something more interesting, anything with the word, \"Dragon,\" will satisfy the adventurous foodie. Oh, and always ask for a side of truffle mayo. Alton Brown visited this place and loved it.

With green onions because: obviously! The menu offers creative sandwiches and poutines as well as some items that would be standards except they are executed so well they can't be boring. Order and pay at the counter, and your meal will be delivered. Go ahead and plan for plastic cutlery. There's usually a beer special, and always a grilled cheese of the day.

It's not often I think about a place weeks after I've been there.  This is one of those places!!  All I had was a cheese burger and poutine fries.  My dinning companions for the day had a wrap suggested by the counter person and the Sloppy Nick and Duck Duck Goose fries.  Of course we shared everything.  I chose the burger as suggested by my friend who said and I quote \"They're solid dude\"  he did not miss the mark either.  The meat was not your normal burger off the street.  It tasted as if someone cared about their cows.  I don't weigh my burgers down with condiments or the garden often, and decided on mustard only this time.  Letting the hamburger shine and shine it did.  The gravy on the poutine was perfect, not to salty which is often the case and the cheese was just as good as any I've eaten in Wisconsin.  The Duck Duck Goose fries killed and they were the first thing to disappear, the Duck skin was \"solid.\"   I didn't try the Sloppy Nick until the next day as my dinning companion could only eat half and was going to through it out.  I had to ask if she minded me keeping it for lunch the next day.  If it was like what I had already eaten it was going to be just as good tomorrow.One draw back I'd like to mention, but not worth down grading the review.  When we show'd up we were told it was take out only.  They close from 3-5pm to prepare for the dinner rush.  Would have really loved to dine in, but our hotel was less then a block away and it was a warm day.  Next time I'm in town I'm going back for the special which I've been told is the real reason they're so busy and during normal business hours!!"}, {"review_id": "fu4g8ZWY9kOKqgWsK7aceg", "user_id": "CByH-ICAI0oELICqs0RVvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "I always love dining her.

The second is shaved prime rib with mayo, cheese, bacon, and horseradish slaw on a brioche bun. Fantastic. Line moves quickly and wait wasn't too long for our food.

The short of it is that they offer some really cool, and tasty, twists on classic sandwiches and fries. Solid old market location, but it's easy to miss if you're not paying attention. This is a lunch spot, so don't show up in the evening expecting to cash in on good grub (like I did when I first failed at checking this place out). For the price, my burger (Block Burger) was small... I'm not buying this 1/3 lb business they're selling.  It was tasty enough.  Also had the Gangsta Fries (pork rinds, chipotle sauce, green onions). Truth be told, by the time I was halfway thru the basket I wished that the Gangsta Fries were just regular old fries. I got a little bored with the flavor & as they cooled the experience was a lot less enjoyable.  The Mrs. had the Croque Garcon Burger and the Duck Duck Goose fries with no complaints. I might come back to try some of the other sammies but am going to stay away from the burgers from here out. Will probably opt for the less dressed fries as well."}, {"review_id": "otR_tq7GQ_WAJKx8ffYRaw", "user_id": "klnpokLyOo-FO_NxxGkM3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/14/2018", "text": "Came in for Saturday lunch around 12:30pm.

Instead, for this review, I will simply mock those \"taste-def schmucks\" that gave Block 16 less than a 5-star review...1-star reviewers: You guys seem to be whining about the wait. Wanna know why there's no wait at McDonald's? Oh well, enjoy your Big Mac and thanks for not making the line here any longer than it is already.2-Star reviewers: I keep picturing you guys as the actors in the TV commercial about going \"nose blind\", except now, your \"taste blind\" too.  So sad.3-Star Reviewers: Where have you been holstering your tongue? It must have been in a dark place not to recognize how good the food is here.4-Star Reviewers: If this is only a 4-star place, where are you eating that's worthy of a 5-star review? I laughed at the guy that said \"I'd rate them higher, but no one is worthy of a 5-star rating\".

We also came to celebrate our other roommate's late birthday. Regardless, one doth not need a special occasion to visit Block 16. Just bring your appetite and a lot of patience if you plan on coming around and after 6pm any night of the week, as the throng of anxious customers start to quickly queue. Block burger: they've managed to master the art of simplicity with this plain Jane cheeseburger, with the star of the burger being the perfectly cooked medium rare beef patty. So tender and juicy it's sure to make any mouth water. Pulled pork roll with a side of sweet potato fries: this is what my roommate who's never tried Block \"magnificent\" 16 before. She really enjoyed it, but loved the sweet potato fries the best. I sampled some of those babies and I'd have to agree. Though modest and minimalistic in style, it still maintained crisp and crunch that made it enjoyable to eat. Dragon fries: my favorite specialty fries on their menu! There was a thick slice of mozzarella cheese on top that I could not finish. Wish it stayed stringy/melted instead of cooling down to a thick blanket covering my fries. Duck duck goose fries: everyone else's favorite specialty fries. I'm not a big fan of duck and only tried it once but I gave it another go tonight and I change my mind. This is an exception to my anti-duck phase. Croque garçon burger: the birthday girl devoured her burly burger and was able to do it in a pretty graceful way, without having egg yolk drip all over the place. I do really like the bread they serve the burger on. Sandwiching everything in a ciabatta roll certainly ups the fancy level. This place serves quality food for an affordable price with everything being less than $10, yes please! As expected for a small and very popular joint like this, it was no surprise to see the line grow and reach the entrance 10 minutes before 6 on a Friday night. Parking close by can be a hit or miss but there's also plenty of space available a block or two away. Plus, the extra distance gives you a chance to walk off the well worth calories."}, {"review_id": "NgZMugTgB_5UzW0VQJxNLg", "user_id": "jxoICTyF6GxtwK37ah7XlA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "This place is so good with different options.
