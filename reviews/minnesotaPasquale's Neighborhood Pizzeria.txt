There were a lot of options for pizza. My husband loved his stuffed pizza and I had a slice of cheese pizza and it was great. We finished with chocolate gilatto, absolutely delicious! It was $35 for both of us, including 2 beers. Clean restaurant.Absolute gem of a neighborhood spot. We'll be back soon and often."}, {"review_id": "OFmzjQlIRa5N0expr0Vqug", "user_id": "qZeX1ZZkN7DXk10keuGOhg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "I must say, I was very impressed by my first Pasquale's experience. Pasquale's brings back the dying tradition of pizza by the slice, which can be hard to find outside of a big city, but you'll find it here in Rochester. Though the building is new, it feels like a big lived it warehouse converted to pizza making machine inside. You can either order pizza by the slice or whole depending on your hunger level. They keep it simple here. Pizza, breadsticks, calzones, and salads. The Bianca pizza is sure to be a favorite for those who don't like a tomato based pizza. It's full of garlic flavor. For the omnivore, they offer a full array of meat toppings that is sure to satisfy even the toughest critics. No reservations here, but it does get busy on weekend nights, and because of the high ceilings can get quite noisy so it may not be your first choice if you're looking for an intimate affair. Also please note they have gelato, if you're looking to top the meal off with something sweet."}, {"review_id": "MdGxCrVZRlfUQM1FYbSgPw", "user_id": "ygVsR4KK70FJM0DXlPUBBg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Had high hopes for this place that appears to be well marketed but ended up being disappointed.The garlic knots were hard and needed more saltiness.The crust on the pizza was blah and slightly undercooked.  It's not the best in town by far.  We always have leftovers with pizza for the next day or two.  Ours ended up in the trash, not edible.The one star is for the Gelato offering.  Nice job there.We have better choices so this was a one and done for us on the pizza.  I'll give it another try for a different menu option sometime.  Maybe it was an off night with their crew."}, {"review_id": "Pp315nAo2gnrvkcg3isqKg", "user_id": "OIdA2FwoWlzfrBdkOqIyPg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/10/2017", "text": "I was able to enjoy Pasquale's on a great night out with family. We showed up 12 deep and had no trouble finding a table and booth to seat all of us, I hear they recently expanded and it's a beautiful space. We didn't have to wait very long before the pies started to come out staggered from the kitchen. We had a custom pie with sausage (delicious, mild spice full flavor), pepp and olive. And a Bianca with squash (get it it's insane) plain cheese for the young crowd and a Sicilian thick crust pie that was perfection. It's hard to get the dough crispy on the outside and have it be cooked so it's not heavy, they succeed. Desserts are plentiful and house made. The gelato was some of the best I've had, and in Rochester to boot. Try the sea salted caramel, try to share you won't. They have a cold case with frozen treats like oranges with sherbet inside to go (I know it's winter but that is refreshing) great beer and wine selections too. Staff is on point, always smiling and courteous. Very friendly crew who want to make you happy. I felt like I stepped into a pizzeria in NY, not at all what I was expecting but I'm so delighted that this place is in town. They sell pastas, calzones and by the slice also. I can't wait for the calzone next time. The kitchen btw is in full view of everything so you see all the action and know the food they are making is top notch."}, {"review_id": "XKY8brbzBxGkx3hSAylZUQ", "user_id": "mhiG7sp5vM9ORV6kTZcX2Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "1/15/2018", "text": "Really nice people however the entire experience was ruined by harsh smelling mop cleaning water. Wife and I arrived forty five minutes before closing.  After placing our order we sat down in the lobby and smelled what can only be described as fake fruit plastic smell meets urinal cake.  It was UNBEARABLE. we changed our order from \"for here\" to \"get us the hell away from here\".   Completely ruined our appetite. Look if you're going to be open until 9 pm please save the harsh cleaning until 9:01.  I'm sure there are other things that can be done pre close that don't make me want to vomit."}, {"review_id": "r3d_cXjxYLsUi-1fHySu3g", "user_id": "iOIVkS-xEpYnLQyRWFB6Xg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Updated review- After visiting this location three times, my experiences improved each time. Last night, I enjoyed a Pepperoni NY Style slice from their food truck. This slice of pizza was really damn good. Also, the staff seemed like all family members. Friendly, fast, and fresh pizza. Will now come back for a full pie of the pep! Thanks for the great experience. 1st review- We stopped in for lunch, browsed the menu board, looked over the a-la-carte option lunch. We didn't identify much that we would enjoy a-la-carte so we ordered off the menu. With us being on a 45 minute lunch, we made sure to ask how long the food would take to cook. Accounting in our time, we were informed of a 15 minute bake time for the Stromboli. After paying and sitting down, we waited 30 minutes. At that point, I went up and our food was sitting on the counter ready. Since they provided us with a number for our table we assumed the food was brought out. This seems like a re-occurring theme for this location. As far as the food goes, the garlic knots, both Italian Stromboli's were good. You can tell the dough was fresh and not frozen. The total tab of this (along with two fountain drinks) was 32 dollars. This to me seems like on the high end but comparable to other Rochester costs. Honestly don't think I will visit this place again due to such poor service/organization. Maybe I needed to order ahead or choose off the a-la-carte option."}, {"review_id": "lxCa-wPxnK379rauDK89Ww", "user_id": "nx0DNXrPW05sYVX90S03Tg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Great pizza, lots of cheese- one of the best in town.

Nothing special. The atmosphere is what ruined it for me. I will only order take out or delivery from here. For it being located in a nice part of Rochester, in a trendy neighborhood, I was disappointed to find ALL disposable cutlery and plates. The service was also slow and every time I needed something I had to flag someone down. It wasn't really that busy either and a few employees were even standing around behind the bar. They were friendly when I did get their attention.

This has quickly become our family's go to pizza place for both eat in and carry out.Service has always been friendly, and now that they've been around awhile they seem to have a lot of the \"new restaurant\" kinks worked out.  Love the pizza, especially the Bianca (which is my favorite), and the garlic knots.I really only have two major complaints:1. Seating is limited.  You pretty much have to have someone wait and pounce on a table as it opens up while someone else waits in line and orders - or you'll be left without a place to sit.2. The garlic knots come out over cooked more often then not.  When cooked right, they are AMAAAAAAAZING!"}, {"review_id": "f0HyisiWXnNMw4qyavzqqQ", "user_id": "SPmaZWRB_6RqSifoMw4dsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/18/2018", "text": "Probably the best pizza in Rochester.  I really like this place and the prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you get.  Everything on the menu is great. I love the Bianca pizza which comes without red sauce.  The stuffed Sicilian is a thicker crust and although I typically like a thick pizza crust, I like the traditional New York Style here more. If you love bread and thick dough though, it may be worth trying!  The calzones and Strombolis are also supper good and quite large! Some of my favorite toppings are sausage, pepperoni and olives.  As for desserts, I love mousse! The Cannolis are also good but not very sweet.The place can be packed during lunch and dinner times so I typically do take out.  When there is a line, the wait can be quite long so be sure to call ahead if you are planning to do pick up.The decor and ambiance of this place is also great!

Well that's until Pasquale's. You see I'm from New York, Staten Island to be exact. If one thing I remember from living there is the food. Where i lived was heavily populated by the good ol Italians. So the Italian restaurants in the neighborhood makes the so called \"Olive Garden\" look like a fraud, which it is but besides the point. Pasquale's pizzeria is authentic to the sauce. It took me right back home.

It offers by the slice and whole pies, stromboli, and calzones. It carries a variety of Italian beverages, wine by the glass, and draft beer. The pros: Quality ingredients. The cheese and meats are top notch. They also offer a New York style that you cannot get anywhere else in Rochester.The interior of the restaurant has a slight industrial feel to it, but it works.  Lots of seating and windows throughout. The cons: The service. Our table waited half an hour when quoted only 15 minutes,then ended up with the wrong order, forgotten items, and being charged for clams (what?). Also, not for the veggie friendly. There are no salads or remotely healthy items on the menu. Basically just pizza.Overall, Pasquales is a fun new option in downtown Rochester.

That got my attention, so I looked over and saw the Pasquale's booth. I had been meaning to try their pizzas, and for $2/slice (originally $4/slice) I couldn't pass up the offer. I got 2 slices 1) pepperoni - the standard to try. It had a nice crunch and had just enough grease to drip on my newly washed jeans when I took a bit. 2) Bianca - Olive oil, garlic, ricotta cheese, mozzarella, fresh basil. I was skeptical at first since olive oil pizzas can leave someone feeling unsatisfied due to eating a pizza without marinara sauce. I actually liked this one a lot. The basil had the perfect touch to tie in the ricotta. Again, had a nice amount of grease with every bite. I would definitely get this slice again.Very good NY style pizza. Thank goodness for the incoming rain that brought on the half price pizza! Now I can spread the word."}, {"review_id": "JioQqgCjOaMDQVgiqelAIw", "user_id": "q5H4puhcNvwXWLSiap4Xig", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/29/2018", "text": "I was thrilled when I found out Pasquale's added vegan cheese to their menu!
