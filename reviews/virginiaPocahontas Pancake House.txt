I drink a lot and I'm hard for wait staff to keep up with. My coffee cup was refilled several times. Way to go.Perhaps most amazing was seeing my grandkids consume their pancakes. Normally not big eaters but those pancakes soon disappeared. I thought I might have a chance to finish them off. Nope. Grandpa got nada."}, {"review_id": "38fgQEFOpqzKFYD9bU7iig", "user_id": "SQpdHo8l4iURQft5ao65Mg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "For starters, the staff is friendly and attentive. No complaints with staff or how the food was cooked.I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes with an egg on the side. The pancakes are thick and don't offer much flavor. The chocolate chips tasted like \"easy bake oven\" chocolate; they were also just melted on top of each pancake, not mixed into the pancake batter. This made the middle of each pancake just a chocolate mess. The portion is large and I could barely eat half of it."}, {"review_id": "Kg3MCTmcBaIUtdHaOCmfTw", "user_id": "dUtJTT8asQqR7Sw537FoNQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "Not impressed, won't be back. Pancakes were not good, very dry and bland. Considering how busy the place gets they don't have ample space for people to wait and people end up hover over people that are trying to eat. We were seated at a table near to the front door and it was like a freeway of people coming and going. Multiple people in my party were bumped by customers passing by, customers trying to pay and wait staff. Also out chairs were kicked all while trying to eat. They need to come up with a better system for people waiting to be seated. There were way to many people waiting to be seated hovering over our table as we ate it was very uncomfortable. The so called  \"teepee\" in the back corner is hot, stuffy and way overcrowded. Our waitress got multiples items that we ordered wrong and had to go back and forth to get the correct items. And then brought our check right after we got our food. I understand they were busy but we felt very rushed. I would not recommend this place as a \"need to go\" spot to people visiting VA Beach. I am a local this was my first time going and will not be back. Food is not worth the wait or the hectic ness. I gave 2 stars because my husband said the coffee was not back and the French toast was ok."}, {"review_id": "6L030z0Q1R02uLJDvVtWUA", "user_id": "yMkzxS_OlgsELZYDHU5urA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I was excited to try this place as Yelp reviews hyped up the food. But alas, I was let down. I tried their 3 layer challah french toast - it's just pieces of french toast, cinnamon, bananas, strawberries and pecans. I can probably put this together in my own kitchen.Maybe I'm not being fair since I've had better french toast elsewhere and thus, my standards have been raised.Also, our server wasn't friendly. I felt a bit bad for my friend because she's usually an indecisive person and couldn't decide what to get, and the server's pose and attitude made my friend more anxious. The cashier lady was nice and friendly though, so 2 stars.IMO, this pancake house is a regular average Joe breakfast place that is not a MUST-GO restaurant when visiting Virginia Beach."}, {"review_id": "Zl7yAkheYzDI7PVUbTCa4Q", "user_id": "5Nv8CoqK_95u0rCbxA9LKg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "WAFFLESSSS! The best I've ever had! My second time coming here. My first time was many years ago and I didn't think too much about the food back then. Today I ordered the breakfast sampler #2 because I wanted to try a little bit of the basics, especially the waffles and French toast. The waffles are to die for. It comes with a good load amount of butter. They were toasted perfectly and made fresh. My fiancé had pancakes on the side and those were also amazing! Extra fluffy!We came here around 9am and it was already busy. Wait time wasn't bad though. Definitely worth coming for the waffles, pancakes, and French toast."}, {"review_id": "HoLAtxsjxAUTPcemB2mA1g", "user_id": "Xj6kMUw7q59UYZznQtHKDw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Was out at Virginia Beach for the weekend and needed a GF breakfast.  Found it in spades at this diner.  So they had toast, bagels, waffles and pancakes all GF on top of the staples of eggs, bacon, and potatoes.  On to the meals.   First day I had steak and eggs with GF toast and second day had salmon eggs Benedict over a GF bagel with a side of bacon.  Good food every time.  For a diner they are a bit pricey, but they are on the beach and heir food is good so balanced out."}, {"review_id": "7EPo1dZ55UDCakMh9VBLsA", "user_id": "N89GpqVUGZ5KPkvioFilnA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "We were seated very close to other customers, almost uncomfortably close, even though the other side of the restaurant was empty.

Servings are LARGE. Don't even think about going here on a weekend cause you'll have to wait.We walked in at 800 this Monday morning and were seated right away on the back wall between two other couples...shoulder to shoulder. I should have protested...a couple coming in behind us did. By the time we left it was almost full so I felt better. But next time I will speak up and have the first part of my breakfast in solitude.

The place had a good number of patrons and they seemed to be seating people down one long wall with a padded bench. I was dinning alone and was seated very close to an older couple and another table. The seating was very akward and i felt much too close to either table. Anyway the staff was very friendly and nice. Checked on me often and kept my coffee mug full. I got blintzes and home fries to eat.The blintzes were run of the mill and not super flavorful and the home fries were very plain. The home fries were basically just potatoes that were lightly smashed into a home fry configuration. No onions no Peppers no salt. Adding salt and ketchup improve them a lot. I should have tried their french toast, maybe next time."}, {"review_id": "pPauf7Ry16ITWS5BJkF4gg", "user_id": "dTOAGHLQWJbitQgoJ4kxaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "Awesome breakfast!! Hearty portions.  Wait staff was friendly and extremely accommodating.  Our order consisted of egg white omelet - HUGE! French toast, a breakfast sandwich, and eggs and sausage.

The decor here is so unique it's all Native American themed as you could tell by the name. It's a pretty average sized location with a waiting area that's designed as a hut. The food is AMAZING! Breakfast mostly of course the portions are very filling. I can honestly say IHOP has got nothing on this place. The food is very \"diner\" food if that makes sense it's really hearty semi heavy food. I LOVED the French toast and the veggie wrap. I came to this place 3 this this whole trip love it!The only bad side to this place is the hours it's only open to 1PM, and the service. The servers are nice but this place is so busy I never got enough water or I had to wait for a refill or I didn't get my drink on time. Other than that definitely try this place out its a 4 star in my book."}, {"review_id": "pTA8I5tijYHU_kppmRDftA", "user_id": "p6Ix9I3LjiRxahwhUl06FQ", "rating": 2.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "What a waste of per diem. Unless you have a litter of children who love pancakes, steer clear. Total tourist trap where everything is slopped together.

Like seriously. I'm going to be dreaming about them. I knew I wasn't going to be able to eat the whole thing, so I got to take the rest with me and they're even good leftover. We wish we had more time to go back! We both thoroughly enjoyed them, and he's an egg snob and even commented on those as well. I also got the California breakfast wrap, which was a tad lackluster. But man, if you're looking for pancakes this is definitely the place!Can't wait for our next vacation to take our family there, but expect a wait for sure. The place is cute but small.
