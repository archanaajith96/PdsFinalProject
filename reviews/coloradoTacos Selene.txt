Oftentimes, it's a gamble as there are so many twists people can put on traditional dishes. This brings me to my visit to Tacos Selene. Right off the the freeway, it is conveniently located and accessible. Parking has never been an issue for me despite there being multiple businesses in the plaza that this establishment is located in. I'm a bit of a barbacoa snob. Back to my original point - there is SO much variation in how it can be prepared. Growing up in southern New Mexico, I live for moist, tender barbacoa with just the right amount of fat in it. Too lean? I'll pass? Too fatty, nah bruh. So anyway, their menu is quite extensive - offering everything from burritos to tacos to menudo on Saturday and sundays. The do have fountain drinks but they also have glass bottles Come products. (I swear to you - 100x's better than American Coca Cola).  Of course I went for the barbacoa burrito and was NOT disappointed. The prices are a bit steep for burritos but you totally get what you pay for! Their portion sizes are huge. Don't forget to sample all of the salsas from the salsa bar!"}, {"review_id": "qwz5YyH0fByEe6ZZeyVZDQ", "user_id": "MFtn4IicoJp4ONTATLdnsw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/9/2018", "text": "Happened to drive by this place the other day and did a double take. The name sounded familiar but I didn't know why. When I looked it up on yelp, there it was on my bookmarks :)I had the standard street tacos (two al pastor, two carne asada) and a coke. Tacos are $1.50 each! Damn! That explains why it was so busy, including what I assumed to be everyone from Buckley AFB. They have a nice salsa bar that includes escabeche red onions and carrots. The al pastor tacos were a bit greasy for my liking. It was almost like they were cooked in chirizo grease drippings. The carne asada were bland until you put all the fixings in top (e.g. salsa, onions, cilantro). Overall, the place was okay. It's a bit off the beaten path and I'm not sure I would make a special trip to eat here. It's worth a visit if you're in the area."}, {"review_id": "qg3IGpIoFjxeXME9IB9WBA", "user_id": "R6zs_RK9gy9SR6aOvzCs4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/12/2017", "text": "This is one of my favorite taco places ever! I usually only go once a month because I try to moderate my intake, otherwise, I would be there everyday.Their tacos are made fresh to order and I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered, including quesadillas. My boyfriend typically orders steak and carnitas tacos and a steak quesadilla. I usually order tripe and tongue. They cook both the tripe and tongue perfectly. The tripe is cooked so that it is not rubbery and the tongue is cooked perfectly tender. The flavors on the tacos are amazing and their salsa bar just adds to their foods' deliciousness.They are also really nice and efficient at Tacos Selene. The place can get a little messy during the lunch hour turn around, but Tacos Selene is on it and constantly wiping down tables. Their restroom is clean too.If you're in the area, stop on in!"}, {"review_id": "853p_G48tq9Py752jxBG9Q", "user_id": "SaAjnnn7U6JnNWNv91VNuQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "My husband insisted that we must TRY this place.

My friend's had the burritos with everything & she said it was one of the best burrito she's had. Their tacos are amazing as well~ asada (steak), adobada (pork), pollo (chicken) were all tasty. I believe they make their own tortillas for the sopes and the whole thing was unbelievable~ I don't even like beans & I ate the whole thing because it was that good. Service is always super fast & friendly.  They have a little salsa bar so you can pick to your liking.  Definitely my top pick for burritos."}, {"review_id": "_obYab6v1UPKNiRK111sFw", "user_id": "djnABwjEmUtgWKWNA9EOWg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "This place was great !!

This restaurant is certainly a hidden gem located right off of 6th in Aurora. I didn't think much of the place driving up to it, but seriously don't let outside appearances deter you. I ordered four carne asada tacos, which is one order, for $6. The tacos came out in 2 minutes. Wow. They were double tortilla'd and came with onions and cilantro. The first bite was heavenly. No fancy sauces or exotic meats; it was so basic yet so delicious. The beef was so well cooked and seasoned. I could've eaten 16 tacos had I not been in a rush. I seriously recommend taking a few friends and check out the greatness that is Tacos Selene."}, {"review_id": "CKhak96aBLYE3vqrEonhxA", "user_id": "XlrhaNv4cvc4y5_X7QZgBg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/28/2017", "text": "The old adage: never judge a book by its cover, def comes into play when you talk about Tacos Selene! I've been driving by it for several years now without even batting an eye. Turns out this under-appreciated gem hidden in a small strip mall off 6th Avenue and Chambers Road in Aurora serves up some killer tacos!The inside is about as underwhelming as the outside. Def a no frills deal going on here. It could use some updating, but appearances aren't everything! We headed to the register to browse the menu and make our selections. The tacos range in cost from a mere $1.50 to $2. Wow! Talk about a great deal. They also serve up quesadillas, sopes, burritos, and tortas. The staff was very friendly too!My classmate and I both opted for four tacos each: alpastor, pollo, barbacoa, and adoboa. Yum! They're served up in traditional street taco form and then there is a small salsa bar with various topping options. I gladly added some spicy pico, pickled onions, and verde to my taco plate. Everything was delish! Perfect amounts of seasoning/spice on everything. Now that I know what I've been missing, I plan to add Tacos Selene to my post-class meal plan!"}, {"review_id": "aKiC2gGxZRhCMXeb_QpasA", "user_id": "Qz7XU2bJfdAR_va18B5Ulw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "The food here was absolutely amazing and it was really cheap!

Whoops! The location: You think, why 4.5 starts on Yelp and 4.6 on Google?? It's in an old run down strip mall. BUT....The FOOD: Delicious. Deliciouso. Tacos were so cheap and filling, burritos were good and sopes....sopes? They were amazing. Man I wish I had a picture. Hands down favorite meat: Barbacoa. I will say this, though it's not like their items need any more flavor than they already have, they have no salsa for the gringos coming in (that's how you know it's as close to authentic as Colorado can get). So be warned, all the salsas we tried were HOT-at the same time, I didn't need it either. The flavor was so good in the tacos and sopes. I also had their Horchata--very good! The atmosphere: I wanted to make sure I mentioned this, there's a grill in the front where they make the fresh tortillas. Then you sit down, wait for your food, and eventually EAT those deliciously fresh tortillas. The staff there was very friendly and you could tell they have a very loyal crowd that comes through. My final verdict: Come. Eat Tacos or Sopes or even Quesadillas (for the next time).

Yelp you did not disappoint me on this one!So here I am driving across country half starved and half broke. What better thing to eat than tacos? This place is what I'd consider typical of a taco place. Bright decor, TV blaring soap operas in the background (futball on the other side), and not the cleanest place but good enough to get the job done. There was a line... first good sign. You wait in line, you order and you either get it to stay or go. I decided, at first, to stay. I got a water and sat down. I ended up getting my food to go because I was being harassed by a customer. (drunken idiot who assumed I didn't understand any Spanish. I wish I didn't after some of the things he said to me). I got my food and then set out to the salsa/hot sauce area. There is a good selection from mild to blow your nose off. I ordered 2 al pastor (marinaded pork) tacos, 1 carne asada (beef steak) taco, and 1 lengua (tongue) taco. I also got 1 al pastor sope. The asada was slightly better than standard although tender enough to enjoy. The lengua, which normally I LOVE, was too tough and chewy and I had to throw it away. (which is a shame because it cost extra). However the al pastor 100% made up for all of it. OMG folks it was delicious. Honestly no extra salsa was needed it was that flavorful. Between the tacos and the sope I think the sope won for sure. (I wish I had just gotten 2 of those).  Speaking of... it's a lot of food, I WAY over ordered. Oh and the salsas were okay. The pico was my favorite. The dark red salsa had a weird taste, too much like raw re-hydrated chili peppers. The green ones were flavorless. The off red colored one will set your mouth/stomach on fire... seriously. All in all I enjoyed my tacos and If I could, I'd go back. For sure get the Al Pastor and try a sope, you won't regret it.  (ps their Guacamole is pretty good too but needed salt)"}, {"review_id": "Ki89nSMsAgOzFHmn_ZN-8g", "user_id": "Sq2eiCTUa24NasnSt3s4Eg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/27/2017", "text": "Price is great!

Yes, it was a loooong wait even though we went during the tail end of lunch time but the TACOS ARE SO WORTH IT. Most likely, the wait time is because the tacos come out hot & fresh, which doesn't happen at other places anymore buuut that's beside the fact. I had the pollo (chicken), alpastor (pork with pineapple) and the adobada (pork) tacos. It was like an explosion of flavors in your mouth, the seasoning of the meat was incredible. & if you are an explorer, test out their salsa bar. I personally enjoyed their jalapeño topping with the salsa verde. All for $1.50/taco.
