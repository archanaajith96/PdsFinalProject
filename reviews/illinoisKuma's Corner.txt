I did order a different burger this time as well. High on Fire came with roasted red pepper, grilled pineapple, sriracha hot sauce, sweet chili paste and prosciutto. What an amazing tasting burger. It comes served on a pretzel bun, which is very smart to use with how juicy this burger is. Had they used any other bun, it would deteriorate and become difficult to eat. I ordered my burger medium rare, a huge patty and perfectly cooked. Every bite had very intense flavors. The sweetness from the grilled pineapple complimented the saltiness with the prosciutto very well, combine that with the sriracha and sweet Chili sauce and you get all kinds of goodness in your mouth. I would definitely recommend this burger. It might be my go to burger here, but I might venture off and order something else. Their fries are also very fresh and tasted good with the side of what I would assume homemade ketchup. My wife ordered the Kaijo burger w/ Blue cheese and smoked bacon. It was also very tasty but not as good as my High on Fire. I'm not really quite sure why their lunch special version of their burgers didn't taste as good as this, but I probably wouldn't order them again. I'll stick to their regular sized burgers."}, {"review_id": "gwp2HxW5yBM03wrAdMKU_w", "user_id": "yXTmo9nxshBGcqjTRWHOMg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "The best restaurant in Chicago. Period. Nothing I've ever been to in the city compares in the slightest. Kuma is an excellent laid back bar with incredibly reasonable prices, huge portions, and amazing flavor beyond compare. I can't stress how much it's necessary to eat here if you've never gone.I went twice in one week because I couldn't get enough. The second time I came, everyone in the restaurant from the hostess to my first waitress recognized my boyfriend and me, telling us how happy they were that we came back. S+ service with attentive and personable staff.The fries are out of this world, extra crispy and a huge portion to boot that comes with your burger. I ordered a side of garlic edamame instead, and that was also amazing. If you go with someone else, I recommend getting one side order of edamame and one of fries so you can share. The \"sides\" are huge.Now on to the burger. Best burger ever. Cooked to perfection, humongous, and topped with an egg for extra impact. I'm having trouble describing how good it is because words can't do it justice. I recommend getting the Kuma burger for starters. Expect to see me at least once a month. Keep being amazing Kuma."}, {"review_id": "fFfypmCkmLp9RPzyiCdOkg", "user_id": "TZBIjCMQ684ZtNMXpoFeyQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Kumas corner is in my neighborhood so I decided to have a meeting there today.I didnt eat although the burgers looked delicious.I got to kumas aroubd 4pm (thursday) Approximately at 5pm the place was packed ! As I walked in I was greated immediately All the staff were super friendly and a waitress was at my table instantly and again when my guest showed up. Kumas carries local draft beer but they also serve cocktails.I knew kumas was a pub so I expected the music to be a little on the louder side but I didnt realize it was more of a heavy metal pub so the music was mostly that genre if I got it right .. so it isnt the best place to have a meeting haha. Although it could be a cool place for dinner / lunch.

Regarding the burger, heavenly.Now, as I mentioned I usually get my food to go via delivery however I actually picked up this time. If you pick up on a Saturday fair warning don't arrive early. There is no room to stand and wait. Ended up standing outside because I felt like I was in a way.

Definitely one of the better gourmet burger joints in Chicago.My one complaint is that the fries paled in comparison to the burgers. I had the black Sabbath. It tasted like a southwestern chili, but in a burger, but in a good way.This place is normally busy, so expect a bit of a wait to get seated if you're coming around a rush hour. Also, beware that they play some really heavy music, so from experience, I recommend that you don't come here if you're trying to recover from a hangover despite how hefty/hearty the food is. The aesthetic here isn't quite my forte so I'm not awfully compelled to come again, but without a doubt, I would recommend it to someone who wants to appreciate a good burger."}, {"review_id": "4uwobALOd0KOmfuSWkes7w", "user_id": "_fN0B5CocWhSkf3pyaaTGw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "For the last GoodBeer venue of my Chicago visit, I returned to this long-established Avondale bar and elaborate-burger joint.  The bar and tables were crowded at lunch, but I snagged the last barstool.  I found the loud, pounding rock distracting. I tried two items from their excellent packaged beer selection.- From Chicago's Whiner Beer Co., canned Hell Kitty Kitty Belgian-Style Pale Ale.  7% ABV.  Pours a clear amber, with a one-finger cream head.  Somewhat tart, citrusy nose.  Tart tropical fruit and orange taste; suggests a high-test witbier.  Brewed with Bastogne yeast, described as \"Orval yeast without the Brett\"--though I fancy I did pick up a hint of Brett funk.  Dry-hopped with Zythos, Sterling, and Hallertau Perle.  - From Unity Vibration Living Kombucha Tea LLC in Ypsilanti, MI, bottled Bourbon Peach American Wild Ale.  8.0%.  Gluten-free, for those concerned with such; unpasteurized and unfiltered.  And \"Paleo friendly,\" perhaps for any straggling Cro-Magnon beer geeks.  Very slightly hazy straw color, no head.  Vinegary nose.  The flavor profile is reminiscent of a peach variant of Long Island Iced Tea, sweet and sour.  Includes some organic black tea.  Any bourbon character eluded me.  New pub-crawl opportunity since my last visit in 2013:  they're a bit over a block west of the Beer Temple taproom and bottle chop, on Elston just south of Belmont."}, {"review_id": "EfW3Xa-55dyYErbfO90RGg", "user_id": "Wvtg-LyvaKHvL_HYOOwHsw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/25/2017", "text": "I came here with some friends on a Friday night and I swore to myself I would never come back here again because I had such a horrible experience. I'm a huge fan of burgers and I was excited to hear about a place that has uniquely named burgers and plays heavy metal music, which I'm a huge fan of. The staff was beyond rude, it was disgusting. They don't allow you in groups larger than 5 and will not move tables together to accommodate for larger groups. My friend was nice enough switch places with me so I could sit with the larger group, but because they already ordered, they said I couldn't order anything..... I was pretty upset. My friend shared his plate with me - he ordered the black sabbath burger and neither of us were able to take more than a bite or two. The chili tasted old and funky. The night was a total wreck and I couldn't wait to get out of there. Fast forward 4 years, I decided to give this place another try and Im so glad I did. It was a lot less busy and our waitress was so sweet and helpful- totally different experience!! I ordered the Iron Maiden which was great, my friend ordered the plague bringer which is now what I order every single time because it is so GOOD. Literally the best burger I've ever had. The fries are always perfectly cooked. The jalapeño poppers from here are also pretty amazing- I day dream about them sometimes. Glad I revisited and had a waaaay better experience.

With a heavy metal atmosphere they cook up unique burgers cooked to preference and Mac and cheese. If you appreciate burgers then Kuma's corner is definitely a Chicago bucket list item for you. First off their beer list is great, serving beer from many local brewery's- including half acre, 3 floyds and many more. I got the scorched tundra VIII by pipeworks brewing, which is a deliciously citrusy and tropical IPA with an appropriately malty body and smooth finish. The gf got the kiss the sun, which had white whisky, pineapple, the afore mentioned IPA, and a spicy kick. For the burger we settled on the Kuma's burger to appreciate their burger making skills. This includes a pretzel bun, bacon, cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, egg and 10 oz burger. We ordered this medium rare and it came exactly as I imagined it. This is a solid burger with a great beefy flavor. It's rare that medium rare is done right on a burger but they did it. The toppings were all fresh but the bun was a bit doughy. Overall solid burger, we will try another version next time. Also the fried were perfectly fried with just the right amount of salt.Come for the burgers, stay for the beer. Make your judgement of whether Kuma's or Au Cheval is the best Chicago burger. Drink some whisky on tap.Atmosphere: 5/5Food/drink: 5/5Cost: 5/5Service: 5/5Overall: 5/5"}, {"review_id": "1jfIOghQjgbhwTGXW3qBvw", "user_id": "FTO-IazRmdgsmtWJUfB60Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "I'm actually quite shocked that I haven't written a review for this wondrous and critically acclaimed restaurant yet; I've been there a handful of times and have not had one bad experience eating one of their amazing burgers. Oh Kuma's...I means, burgers itself are already a delight, but the way you make them, it's as if you've changed the game! Everyone enjoys a classic beef patty with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles and some condiments, but here at Kuma's, it goes a bit differently. You'll get all of those basic ingredients, but then there are some extras: maybe some avocado, some roasted red peppers, fried egg(s), some chili, bacon, chicken tenders for God's sake! The customizations that these chefs make are ridiculous, but the results are nothing short of tasty. They have other meals here that aren't burgers that I should really check out, such as various apps, mac n cheese and salads, and they also have an extensive selection of beer, draft and bottles/cans. My go-to is usually Allagash White, but I like to venture out and try new drinks when I can, being a beer aficionado. Let's not forget about the main theme that lies within Kuma's: the METAL music. Songs that blast out the speakers, turned up to the highest volume that are as heavy as the burgers produced in the kitchen. Good stuff.Also, they sell merch. How cute! Whether you're from Chicago or visiting, Kuma's Corner is one of those places you NEED to check out at least once. Only downside is if you get there during a lunch/dinner rush, you will wait a while, so make sure you got something to pass the time with."}, {"review_id": "iJTKljjdW6k904zTnYFBxA", "user_id": "wU9ynvh2OYhVbpopoKFx6Q", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Really like the vibe of this place.

My party tried the Sovereign burger and the Mac and cheese and both were delicious. If you're only able to try one get a burger; cooked perfectly and full of flavor, worth the hype.

Anyways, this place actually looks quite old from the outside. The inside is quite dark and old school as well. I came here on a Monday afternoon where there was no loud, heavy, head banging music and the restaurant was mostly empty except those sitting at the bar.The menu is relatively simple with Mac & Cheese options, burger options, a couple of appetizers and salads. There is another menu for drinks that I didn't pay attention to because.. it was way too hot to be day drinking! Anyways, the Mac & Cheeses are custom.. so you get to choose two toppings for $14. I decided to go with bacon and broccoli, strange combo..  I know! And they also have a lunch special burger that's $10 and comes with a side of fries. The food came out very quickly and our waitress was actually very friendly. She came to refill our water often but one thing I do have to mention is that this place does NOT have any AC!
