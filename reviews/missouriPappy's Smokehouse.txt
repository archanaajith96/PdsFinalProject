It was a little out of the way for me, but worth the visit. The line was long but moved quickly. And there was a line the entire time I was there. I had a \"2 meats\" platter which also includes 2 sides. I tried the brisket and the pulled pork along with baked beans and potato salad. Besides the regular fountain drinks they also served bottles of a local soda, Fritz's. I'm a huge fan of Root Beer and since it was made with cane sugar I just had to try it.It was all absolutely wonderful!They bring you the meat plain, and you can add the sauce you like. I'm a BBQ purist. Anyone can dump sauce on some meat and call it BBQ. I like to eat some plain first and get the full flavor of the meat. And I must say, I was extremely happy with Pappy's meat in my mouth They have a HooDoo sauce which has the perfect level of heat, sweet and bold flavor.Definitely recommend a visit!!!"}, {"review_id": "IVf_avZr5_IxBimFooU-4w", "user_id": "18jJ3BeXO0673muT7wdCkw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "BBQ at its finest over here. I came here Sunday morning, about 15 minutes before they opened. Thought it was gonna be a huge line but to my surprise it really wasn't. Maybe Sunday is just a really good time to go. We waited in line for about 10 minutes and then got to order. I order the Adam Bomb. Came with a pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, full slab of ribs, 4 sides, and a frito pie.This is the part where I tell you it was phenomenal and all that good shit. Well it fucking is. Ribs were my favorite and probably the best ribs I've had thus far IMO. If you come here, you better be buying ribs. I didn't get to try the chicken place they own next door. It's literally in the same building and didn't know until I was walking around and checking the place out. Next time I'm in town I'll make sure to try it. The pulled pork was fucking delicious. As for now, I'll give this place 4 stars because the brisket just didn't do it for me. Living in Chicago, I can attest that SMOQUE bbq has the best brisket but these guys just do it a little differently. It wasn't horrible, just different that's all. One more thing to review was the Hoodoo sauce. Damn that sauce was finger licking good. I would bottle that shit up and it'll sell anywhere such as grocery stores, gas stations, sex shops, and everything in between. If your in St. Louis and want good BBQ then go here."}, {"review_id": "6BuH0UfTrEgkgXKXTeUbvg", "user_id": "1jq9hllxvQIUZEfhawRLew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "while I've eaten at poppys before, this time was a little more sureal since the restaurant is scheduled to close.This is/was by far one of the best family restaurants I've ever been to, the food was always delicious, the service was pleasant, and each visit warranted another visit.

I'm glad they were because I got THE most amazing, delicious ribs at Pappy's. It was worth the wait in line, which moved quickly. The service was friendly. The bench seats weren't as comfortable as the hightop tables, so we grabbed one near the door while we waited for our food to be delivered.

What a spirit and enthusiasm of its patrons.  One's encounters starts from yards away watching the smoke and as one gets closer the aroma kicks in. That's a great start. Next is the rough part if one is really hungry and craving for the melt in you mouth  preparations. Enter through a small door  in the parking lot, get in the line, yes the line is for Pappy's. There are no other lines. Small, poorly lit dark hallway where the line is in U-shape. This is chance to contemplate and going back and forth between menu items. You wish, but, you are not going to order one of each item on the menu. Minutes later you enter Pappy's.  Wait, there is still an equal or longer line you just went through. I enjoy the experience and the drama in getting to the counter to Finally place your order! Waiting in the inside line is time to read and see images of who's who have been here before you did. Hungry yet? Finally, the order is placed and decision is made. Did you order more than you are able to eat? Did you break all the diet and healthy eating resolutions you made? Yes, we all did. Now is another several agonizing minutes before the server walks around with food and calls your name. The real encounter and experience with food begins now! It was all worth it. Whether it's ribs, chicken, pulled pork with sweet potato  fries, or a baked potato . No regrets. It's an experience and you have earned it after that weather,  travel, wait in the line choosing what to order.  We we're really fortunate. From entering the building after a 2+ mike walk from the Arch on St Patrick's day we got our order in 30-40 minuets. Because rest of the patrons were either in the parade or watching it or at the Ballpark Village having fun."}, {"review_id": "xKfauisT7PwByr4r_i_hlg", "user_id": "CjZYq_P_iorvgYuh8hcrAg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/21/2018", "text": "Simply amazing.I have had ribs at many corners of the United States and Pappys are the best I have had so far.  Smoky and moist- something I don't see at a lot of bbq joints I have been to.  I would recommend the ribs to anyone that likes bbq.  I got the burnt ends once and they were good.  I would def stick to the ribs.Sides are standard for a bbq place.  The slaw was on the sweeter side and the sweet potato fries were bomb.If there were more direct flights to STL, I would consider coming back more often!"}, {"review_id": "SI2S4JuG7N5QylQUcRTZTw", "user_id": "EaRd_4nFnPs8Fei-H2ZmVA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "What to get: half slab of ribs, green beansService: 5/5Atmosphere: casual sit-downWait: 10 mins (Tuesday 12:50PM for 1)Parking: Street parking (pay for spot)The Experience:Stop #1 on my BBQ trail. Since every place I go sells out of their meats and has long lines, I've strategically planned to visit them all during a lunch hour after the main lunch rush. What was great was that there were tons of spot on the street to park. You can either pay at a kiosk for how much time (you don't need to put your receipt in the car) or via your phone on their app. Nifty!The space is outlined like a square, where you enter down the hallway past the bathrooms. I think generally the line wraps around a little during peak hours, but again, I came at minimal wait time. There are spots to grab a menu so you can decide once you get to the register. You can also check out all the trophies and awards Pappy's has won. They even have celebrities sign their menus and post those on their walls.The staff didn't really introduce themselves to me, but one of them may have been the owner/manager (sorry I didn't know prior to visiting), who was checking on all the guests and asked where everyone was coming from. Really like a family where all the members were chatting with guests and looking after everyone. They're also very efficient in bussing and cleaning tables. The longer I was there, the more tables became available (but this was almost by 2PM).I ordered the half slab of ribs, the deep fried corn, and the green beans. The ribs don't come drenched in sauce and 4 different sauces are provided at each table: 1) Hoodoo sauce2) Pappy's original3) Jane's sweet sauce4) Carolina vinegarTry each of these to see which one you like. I liked a mixture of the Jane's + Pappy's.So first off for the ribs, each one is pretty meaty. The end one may have more bark on it, but the meat is wonderfully tender and juicy. Not fall off the bone, but very easy to bite and eat, which helps so it doesn't all just fall onto the table. Half slab is 3 or 4 full ribs, plus some extra partial ribs/cartilage. As one person with a generally small appetite, it took me awhile to finish all the meat. Always good to balance it out with something else.I loved the green beans! Maybe because they're fresh and still crunchy, but it's how I cook them. I'm not a fan of mushy, overcooked green beans (or any vegetable for that matter). It also helped lighten my meal with the heaviness of the meat.A lot of people get the fried corn on the cob. It's kind of fun since the kernels are almost crunchy. However, it also made the corn stickier, which took a bit of work to get out between my teeth (they have toothpicks, but do yourself a favor and just bring flossers). It's something to try, but I think I prefer regular corn on the cob (being the neat eater I am).Come in hungry because you'll be stuffed when you leave. I had major food coma afterwards, but it was worth it!"}, {"review_id": "p6l41NxxccNmlPiobgaH-w", "user_id": "OTyBUeV85PXohVVNsR-OlQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "So good!!!

Between Southern/Pappy's, Southern definitely takes the crown in my book. We had gotten the Burnt Ends, smoked turkey, brisket, pulled pork, and chicken. For sides, we had the fried corn, vinegar slaw, and fries. The turkey was the meat I had enjoyed the most- it was smoky and definitely very juicy and tender. The burnt ends were okay- but not nearly as flavorful as I had hoped. The brisket was thinly cut and very chewy. It had caught me off guard as I had thought it the texture and consistently would not be so rubbery. The pulled pork was extremely dry, and it was tough trying to eat it even after dousing it with sauce. The chicken wasn't great either- it was bland and had absolutely no flavor to it. The sides were decent, but nothing extraordinary.It pains me to honestly review pappys like this, but I did not have the experience that so many. Perhaps we caught them on an off day.

That's a disservice to Pappy's! Pappy's is the whole reason A fifth star was added.(Maybe that's an embellishment, but I'm telling you, you won't find better... anywhere!)We found out quickly that there is always a line at Pappy's so be prepared to wait. I promise, it's well worth the wait. My husband, mother-in-law, and I were determined to eat at Pappy's so in all honestly, I had no problem loading up my purse with snacks if we had to wait hours. The good news is the lines move quickly so depending on when you go, you're probably only looking at a 10-30 minute wait.So when we sat down... what exactly did we order? EVERYTHING. More specifically, The \"Adam\" Bomb which is a slab of ribs, beef brisket, a pork sandwich, chicken, a hot link Frito pie, and four sides (we did the corn, green beans, potato salad, and baked beans). I'm not joking, everything EVERYTHING was amazing! Needless to say this was a pretty big meal for the three of us, but it would've happily fed 4-5 people... maybe more depending on everyone's appetites.The ribs are dry rubbed and juicy. Quite possibly the best slab of ribs I've ever had in my entire life. No, not quite possibly. Straight up, it was the best slab of ribs I've ever had and ever will. The Frito pie was my next favorite. They use their baked beans, throw in some sliced sausage, top it with cheese and onions, and call it a day. It's phenomenal! They've taken my favorite junk food/concession stand meal and taken it up about twelve notches. The brisket, pork, and chicken were all juicy, smoked, and delicious. And the sides were absolutely perfect. Pappy's has truly perfected and cornered the BBQ market... like I don't want BBQ from anywhere else. Everything else is just substandard. Oh and they carry a local soda brand that I don't recall the name of, but if you love cream soda like me, you'll be head over heals for theirs.It also blew my mind how quick everything worked. Everybody working has got to be running on a combination of Red Bull and BBQ smoke. They ring you up quickly, they serve the food quick, they clean the tables quicker, the managers shuffle from table to table like they're floating making sure everyone's enjoying themselves. They've got it down.Not joking, every trip we make to STL going forward won't be complete unless we go to Pappy's.

Absolutely YES! Growing up in California and now living in Seattle, I knew barbecue I've had wasn't as good as the Midwest, but I didn't know how far behind the west coast is. I've had great barbecue or what I thought was great at the time. I've always stayed away from \"St. Louis\" style ribs because they just do baby back better out west. My avoidance of \"St. Louis\" style ribs is going to continue because they will constantly be a disappointment after Pappy's ribs. OMG the best thing I've eaten in a long time. They don't even need barbecue sauce, the crust is perfect as is. It's like sugary, salty goodness in a bark. The ribs fall of the bone and have perfect smokiness. There's parking in the back, but there's plenty of signs saying park at your own risk and take your valuables inside. I'm guessing it's not the best part of town, but I'll go anywhere for these ribs again. I didn't have time to worry about the sides, but the deep fried corn on the cob was actually pretty good.

Definitely the best BBQ I've ever had, comparing to Texas, Tennessee, and Atlanta. Although it's a dry rub, it was still the perfect amount of saucy and flavorful at the same time. We got the combo with ribs and burnt ends. I was hoping the burnt ends were gonna be a little more burnt than it was, but it was just so good I couldn't con it on that. THE RIBS!!! Is an absolute must!! Wo definitely return for a full slab. Their sides are amazing as well. We got the sweet potato fries, corn on the cob, green beans, and baked beans. YOU HAVE to get the fries! They are literally addicting. The corn was amazing as well and a great refreshing side. However, we were not Wow-ed with the green beans or baked beans. We thought it was very average and probably would not get those sides again. BUT!! Their meat is definitely the highlight and it was just so good, we couldn't fault it a star for their simple sides. Definitely a must try when in St. Louis!!! There is a wait but Pappy's knows how good they are lol their waiting game is really efficient and we got through pretty quick!
