I have eaten here at least 6 separate times and their food is always outstanding. They take a personal touch on everything and add their own flair to meals making for a truly unique and enriching dining experience.We had a great great server named Cassandra who was extremely helpful friendly and knowledgeable. We enjoyed the appetizer of cinnamon chips and banana Nutella, which was delicious.Now for the main course.We enjoyed orange and guava juice mimosas, both of which were delicious and water melon juice. This was some superb water melon juice.This particular occasion we dined upon the special that was a prime rib sloppy joe sandwich with horse radish macaroni salad on the sandwich itself.  The truffle Parmesan potatoes on the side were glorious! This place is truly spectacular and has a great welcoming vibe the minute you walk in.One cannot forget their absolutely delicious bottomless mimosa options. If you are ever in the area, you need to look up Served. You won't be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "A2fJC-BT8adrD6v4d1_REg", "user_id": "Zm3ZDBvV-pYFSAB7NZ5-Dw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I hate to give three stars to any restaurant but this is what yelp is for... honest reviews. This place is a little local spot which made the prices a little unexpected. - Soft Shell Crab Benedict $20 ... there was such a small amount of crab that I could not understand the $20 for basically an eggs benedict with no meat. The sliced potatoes were the best part of that dish. - Apple Pie Tempura Pancakes $12. The portion size was large and it came with tempura fried slices of green apples. The pancakes themselves were good but the sauce from the green apples was pretty sour. We ate about a third because we were hungry but didn't take the left overs. - Fried Chicken and Cornbread French Toast $12. It's possible the menu said how many pieces of chicken and french toast but it was under entree so expected and entree. What came out was three regular to small size chicken wings and three fast food sized French toast sticks. This should not be served as a meal but rather as an appetizer... maybe. I was the only person that ate from this plate and was sick to my stomach most of the day after the meal.  - Watermelon juice was the juice of the day and we left two cups of it untouched because, well, it just wasn't good. I think we paid $13 for a small and a large juice. The chef did come out after our meal and ask how everything was... I didn't say anything about the food to him because I knew there would be nothing else on the menu I would want to try and I was not feeling well by that point. Spending $75 on a meal (after the drinks and tip) and feeling slightly nauseous and still hungry after, will leave anyone writing a mediocre review.  I chalk this place up as \"not for us\" and keep it moving."}, {"review_id": "gM4Rfu1e91-dWeMGeEzEtg", "user_id": "oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/28/2018", "text": "A perfect example of Vegas' neighborhood eatery.  Small, welcoming, friendly, serving food with attitude.What do Korean, Filipino, Peruvian and down home American food have in common?  NOTHING.  Except that they are all on the same menu at Served. Not to fear, non-American dishes are not 100 percent authentic but represent well.  They are all boldly flavored with no regard if they pair with one another or not.  With their large portions, there is very little chance you'll be ordering two mains at the same time.Note:  Breakfast review (the full starters and lunch specials menu is also available).The comp, crispy cinnamon dusted flour tortilla chips are crack in a basket and a great way to whet the palate.As a starter, the loaded truffle parm nuggets with roasted wild mushrooms is solid and actually as advertised.  Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside Yukon gold wedges, and a plethora of meaty, well seasoned wild mushrooms dressed with real truffle oil and a load of parm.  A handful of vegetal micro greens adds freshness.  Good eats.For mains, it's all about the bennies.  All showcase a well made hollandaise with just the right touch of tarragon vinegar and beautiful, soft poached eggs with perfectly fluffy whites.  The base differs to best suit the dish.  All just work once the egg yolk is burst and mixed with everything.  For example, the \"Turf Side\" with sliced filet, aggressively seasoned, EVOO coated, roasted mushrooms, on grilled sourdough; burst the yolks, mix it up, the flavors blend beautifully.  The same is true for the \"Korean Spicy Pork\".  Juicy, spicy, slightly sweet, well marinated pieces of grilled pork atop crisp shrimp rice balls.  Again, burst the yolk for creamy richness that reduces the spice and blends it well with the seafood.  Micro greens garnish all dishes not only making them look good but to add freshness.  Tip:  Wednesday is Industry Day.  Check with the servers for rotating specials.Limited list of libations including a bottomless mimosa (orange or guava) option.Vegas style start to the day done right."}, {"review_id": "8d64VsGVy6ZIat3Jp4qIew", "user_id": "a9st_gGVVwyqaynGPvKTnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "One of our best breakfast/brunch finds.

Big portions, Filipino and cultural undertones. You can also find breakfast basics if you're so inclined to share your breakfast table with basic people who like French toast and things. I have tried the Huevos Rancheros and the Salmon Curry. I HIGHLY suggest the salmon curry. The edges are charred slightly, the rice is delicious and the curry is flavorful but not spicy. This dish is hearty, and has cute little vegetables along the plate. The chef always comes out to ask how your meal is-which is just lovely. They also have fresh squeezed juices. They might even have little secret fruit trees in the back. Not sure. Either way, if you're in the Hendertucky area, check this place out!

The service is lacking here. When we walked in we were stared down by other guest and nobody to greet us right away. After waiting we were sat but the attitude of the server was just not pleasant. Super nonchalant and you could tell he didn't want to be there. I don't know about you guys but that definitely throws me off and puts a bad taste in my mouth before the food even gets there. He didn't make any comments about the menu, didn't ask if we've been in before, didn't take our drink order (another server did), didn't make any suggestions. All he said when we were ready was \"what can I get you?\" Blah.Anyway, the dishes we got were beautifully plated and delicious! We got the Peruvian lomo saltado and the green eggs and spam. We shared an order or the sweet potato fries. I appreciate the fact that my dish came with a side of vinegar as a dipping sauce lol. I couldn't finish my food but everything was so good. The sweet potato fries were in a tempura batter or something, but they probably made it to my top 5 fries lol. The prices are definitely a little high but I'm guessing it's because the quality of food. I definitely want to come back to give the other items a try."}, {"review_id": "EhAZxzY7bNEewpRvLdQtwA", "user_id": "6ImN7CLRvsDnrAx6DF4nIw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/8/2017", "text": "Idk why I didn't start my review earlier if this place because SERVICE was PHENOMENAL and FOOD was so flippin' AMAZING and DELICIOUS. I have to say I wasn't expecting too much since the place is pretty hidden from street view and relatively small and seriously empty when we got there. But it BLEW ME AWAY!! Now I forgot our server's name since time passed; but phenomenal service. He was so down to earth, great with giving us suggestions. And totally understandable of our two little ones. He brought out kids cups, extra plates and napkins without us even asking. He even brought my two year old fresh home made cinnamon chips with some bomb Nutella whip sauce to go with it. My kid went crazy over it! My inner kid secretly did too. Haha. Loaded Potato Nuggets- bomb appetizer. The potato nuggets were nice toasty fried oozing with the toppings. The bacon bits added a nice touch. I recommend sharing between more than two people because I was getting full just from this. It's pretty fried and heavy. BiBimBop- huge serving and so much galbi! So tender; so delicious. I'm salivating just thinking about it. And the use of colored carrots - nice touchMiso pork belly burger - I can't say much about this, but my husband couldn't stop raving about his burger to me. But his tempura sweet potato fries were absolutely delicious. I'm going to have to come back and try their brunch and the rest of the menu. The food is pretty pricey, but definitely worth it. If you are ever in the area, there are tons of parking. It looks like a small cafe, but man does the food pack a punch full of flavor."}, {"review_id": "5DNE4eaxp06vwXFqDItYdQ", "user_id": "FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/3/2017", "text": "The restaurant is able to make tasty Asian-American fusion foods. We were looking for a brunch place and found this on a whim. This is a tiny restaurant that has a homey feel to it. Upon sitting, they give you \"tortilla chips\" dusted with cinnamon sugar with a Nutella dip. This may sound sweet, but it is not that sweet and the Nutella was whipped and very light. I had the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict. It was topped with a Thai Chili Hollandaise sauce that was slightly too spicy for my liking, but it was smooth and creamy and paired perfectly with the marinated roasted pork. There was a little too much fat on the pork belly that was not rendered enough, but the overall flavors of the pork was delicious. It paired perfectly with the sauce, where the sauce accentuated the natural flavors of the roasted pork. This was served on a bed of toasted sourdough crostini, where it soaked up the flavors of the pork and the sauce. There was not too much bread, which was good as it did not overpower the porkMy boyfriend got the Longsilog, which is a traditional Filipino breakfast of fried garlic rice, eggs, and longanisa, which is a Filipino breakfast sausage. They make their own longanisa and it was cooked to perfection, with a crispy outer shell, giving it that classic \"popping\" sound when the casing breaks. The sausage itself was slightly sweet and salty, though not overpoweringly sweet. It was accompanied with their own seasoned vinegar, which is a classic pairing with this type of sausage. The vinegar was not as strong as expected, which was great because a lot of times a strong vinegar can mask the flavors of the longanisa. In this case, the longanisa was the star and paired well with the garlic fried rice and eggs."}, {"review_id": "mf-bPCnLhzWJG9K20qdfvQ", "user_id": "GH-DMEoHktLR34pDJvMItg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We came for breakfast and the food is so good that we wud love to come back again in this short  period of time we have during this trip.

Also have to say Troy our server was great and truly we never saw the bottom of the mimosa's because he's a champ. We've only been twice so we haven't sampled much of the menu yet, but everything has been amazing and I really don't think you can go wrong.

We've eaten close to this establishment before and knew of it from driving by, and also from the Yelp reviews. We arrived today (Saturday) around 1030'sh. It's a small restaurant, but there were seats immediately available, as opposed to our usual restaurant where we have a 30-minute to hour wait. We were greeted with warm smiles and our waiter was nice and friendly. So far so good.The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from. We ordered mimosas and water to start. After speaking with our waiter about what he recommends, we opted for the Barbacoa Benedict and Huevos Ranchero. We waited approximately 10-minutes for our meal. The plates came out with food looking outstanding. Beautiful and appealing to the eye. Large portions too. Then...we took our first bite....HOLY SH$T. I would've slapped my momma the food was balls to the wall legit, delicious. The Barbacoa Benedict is out of this world. Hands down the best Benedict's I've ever had in my life. Blown. Away. The Huevos Ranchero were ri-effing-diculous. Amaze. You know that feeling where you're torn between being pissed off because it took so long to find a gem of a restaurant, but it's so f#cking good that you're also ecstatic?!?! Yep. That was today at Served.The chef and owner also came out while we were eating to check on everyone. Super cool guy who definitely knows his food.Go here. Eat here. Unbelievably delicious.

Came here with a colleague with for lunch during a business trip to Vegas and me being me had to Yelp the best restaurants for lunch before picking a spot. Served came up top so we went with that. Upon entering the restaurant it was shocking. Place was absolutely deserted, literally no one. Shocked we still decided to sit down and give the spot a try. A very nice hostess came over and took out order and dropped off some spiced chips and salsa. From the chips and salsa both my colleague and I both knew this was going to be a special lunch. We both couldn't stop eating the chips they were that delicious. For entree my colleague ordered their club (against my advise) with sweet potato fries and I went with their BBQ Bacon Burger with potato wedges. His club was good but nothing special but my Burger my god was that delicious. Perfectly cooked, quality bacon, and on a solid bun. Overall, this has easily beat Midtown Eats in Reno for me (since they removed the Bison Burger off their menu) for my favorite burger. Delicious.
