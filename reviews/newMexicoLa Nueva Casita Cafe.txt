The chip bowl is made fresh not and it gets such a yummy flavor from stew, egg and it retains some of its crispness.Chile relleño omelet was good. The hashbrowns were not greasy and perfectly crispyService was fast and attentive and they were at capacity. We waited about 10 minutes for a two top totally worth the wait. Parking is on street or a dirt lot. Lunch: went a couple of months back what I like was the additional choices other than just beans and rice. Calabcitias cheesy squash super good or Fideo a noodle soup or a Mexican cabbage Can't go wrong!!!"}, {"review_id": "8QY_Y8s9xlfta5e3k48tUQ", "user_id": "zcUlXyniwZMHmP3Ns6P4Ew", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Great food, affordable prices and super friendly service.This place is in the middle of a residential area so on the way there it almost feels like you're going to someone's house. They also have a parking lot on the side of the building.Our server was very friendly and told us of different areas we should visit during our stay. The food also came out very quickly.I had the taco special with 3 pork tacos, rice and beans. It was very good. The pork in the tacos was excellent. My girlfriend had the daily special that was a green chicken enchilada that was also very good and only $6.99.One thing to note is they do not have beer or any alcohol at all here so if you want a beer with your tacos you will have to go elsewhere.Great lunch spot would highly recommend."}, {"review_id": "JnY1nrV87JB73bVH6yyviQ", "user_id": "KGltySxqHbSrLgRACxB0fA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/10/2018", "text": "Ran across this little establishment thanks to yelp reviewers and was pleasantly impressed!

Upon arriving, we were greeted with friendly service. Sat down right away and our orders were taken promptly. Food was delish and came out fast. We never received our side soups (fideo) that were suppose to come with our dishes. The waitress was reminded about them and she remembered she was suppose to bring them but never did. I also asked for a cup with a lid to go.  Never got that either. The guacamole we ordered came in a dish as small scoops on top of lettuce. So much lettuce for an appetizer of guacamole."}, {"review_id": "AoffoDQPC0-Eut4CJFNYfQ", "user_id": "qTyWutWBpTLRHjqiIDGfPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2017", "text": "What a treat of a find! Smaller restaurant with absolutely delicious food in a simple clean older building. Authentic through and through.We were greeted warmly and quickly, then shown to our table.The chips are served in a metal bucket, much like you might see in a bar for peanuts. They are just right right in thickness and crispiness. The salsa is certainly home made and spicy. There is a jukebox sitting off to one side and patrons amble over on occasion and drop in a coin and classic old songs fill the room. I heard songs I haven't heard in years and we found ourselves laughing and reminiscing over them.The service was excellent. All drinks were kept filled up and the service was delivered with a smile. The waitress seemed vested in the business and interested in seeing it flourish.The corn tortillas were homemade and the real thing. Yummy, soft, steamed delicious home made corn tortillas. People, life just doesn't get much better than that.Between the three of us, we ordered Huevos Mexicanos, Heuvos Compuestas, and chorizo and egg. Each were equally divine. We ended up sampling and sharing each other's plates as they were all so good. The beans and rice were strong and strongly authentically spiced.The coffee was fresh and strong.The parking lot is a gravel lot in back, all nestled in a quaint little neighborhood.Highly recommended! We will be back."}, {"review_id": "wYJPXK4EQYj_2fx3eZ1-yQ", "user_id": "bd3jJPa3udlJJr6wQDbfsA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/1/2018", "text": "No frills but amazing tacos.

A restaurant that really personifies the authentic flavor of New Mexico, according to my experience. We started with a plate of queso, which was delightfully spicy, speckled with chilies. Unfortunately, it was far too spicy for my stepdaughter, the person Hubby had ordered it for, but she can't handle cracked pepper and only likes plain quesadillas and plain refritos, so take her opinion with a grain of salt. Chips were plentiful and hearty. We ate all the queso before our entrees arrived.I ordered a chile relleno and a cheese enchilada and a dish of refritos, which was probably one item too many for lunch, but they were all good. Of course, being in New Mexico, I had to have all my food smothered with red and green chilies, and they added the perfect amount of heat, without upsetting my stomach later, which was an unexpected bonus. I really enjoyed my meal here and definitely recommend La Nueva Casita Cafe."}, {"review_id": "eNSKiIUNTrsb7P2I_76agQ", "user_id": "4PbNnMMfMVJFRDJC3Tk7MA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/16/2018", "text": "This was one of the best New Mexican food I've had.

Nothing here felts Mexican, the chips were dried from a bag. The staff was nice and place looked clean. Food was not good at all, got a stomach ache after I ate here.
