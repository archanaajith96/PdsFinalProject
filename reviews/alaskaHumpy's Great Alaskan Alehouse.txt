The menu has a ton of choice and there's plenty of beer options as well (especially local drafts for visitors like myself). We had the crab roll which had a unique spicy flavor. Usually don't eat the bread but the crab wasn't amazing on its own, however the extremely buttery bread was made to go with this sandwich. Not diet friendly but a good combination.  Also had the halibut fish and chips. This was truly the delicious. A light breading on the flavorful fish and the chips were also good. There's a Man vs Food challenge you can take part in if you're really starving. Otherwise pop in just relax. Not the fanciest spot in town but the food is solid and there's something for everybody."}, {"review_id": "xN0vBe4q0ZxjQ0WGQYbiJQ", "user_id": "UU32HhofVFvM2FqK5jYY1Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "Let me preface this review by saying this is my favorite spot in Anchorage. I've been coming here for a while and as a regular, I am treated like family. Even if you're coming here for your first time, expect courteous and fast service. Their selection of beers and spirits is unparalleled in Anchorage. Their taps constantly rotate with delicious seasonal beers and the seafood is delicious and fresh. I usually start my night with the fresh Alaskan oysters.Sunday is open mic night, so if you're a musician, come prepared to jam with the band. There is also karaoke and trivia on different nights during the week. They do a great job of hosting fun events in a relaxed atmosphere. Plus, they have many televisions so if a game is on, you're gonna catch it.I love Humpy's. It's in a central location downtown and is my tried and true hangout. If you're a local or a visitor, this place is on my must-visit list. Thanks for being amazing, Humpy's!"}, {"review_id": "bag_X5uVU1M8aLF_-M1SBw", "user_id": "sAAowvhLsGrLyCwAGKMrEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/16/2018", "text": "I love Humpy's! All tourists should come here, because it's super Alaskan in my opinion. They serve Newcastle Brown Ale here, which thrills me, because i come from where that is actually made. Not the American version obviously, the actual Newcastle Upon Tyne in England. It's one of our go-to date night places. And invariably, boring old me, always gets the same old thing. The Crab Roll. Which is a GIGANTIC sandwich jam packed with King Crab Salad. It's a grilled style sandwich, thickly sliced bread, i think it may be dipped in egg and griddled, and it has 2 really big scoops of King Crab Salad, and comes with a mound of crispy beautiful fresh fries. It could easily be halved by those less greedy than myself. I always get it, whether I'm flying somewhere, and I'm at the Airport location, or 6th Avenue, but tonight for some reason, I was feeling a little adventurous, and in need of my fries and salad fix, which you KNOW, is a particular favourite of mine, and dump those fries on that salad. Man, what a treat. However my options were either a small or entree sized Caesar, or the Seasonal Salad which sounded superb, with it's soupçon of goats cheese, and candied nuts, always a treat, but see, i was also craving some small representation of crab, and had decided i wanted the Crab Nuggets appetizer with garlic aioli, so in order to fit in this gargantuan mountain of food, it had to be the small Caesar. Friends, i can assure you, i made the correct choice tonight, by deviating from my norm. I did indeed dump the fries on the salad, and even though it was a small salad, it was still huge. I also dumped some of my 8 Crab Nuggets on top. They resembled Crab Cakes more than nuggets, but it certainly did not affect the flavour, which was rich, savory and crispy tasty. I'm not a fan of King Crab Legs and drawn butter - just too rich for me, and i like a mashup, a smorgasbord of flavours if you will. So my choices tonight could not have been better. I felt ill afterwards from being overly full. Like going to Golden Corral, but with better quality food. Husband got nachos. Jeezy Creezy, but every time he gets nachos anywhere, I always say \"That thing is huge\" (keep it clean people, it's a food review) but this plate of Nachos!!! Absolutely humongous. I said to my husband tonight, I'm so grateful i don't have to date anymore, because if my potential date saw me chow down, he'd be like, \"mm no way\" because i'm not exactly the type that pushes a lettuce leaf around for 10 minutes, delicately, then calls it a day. I'm more the type to eat every morsel of food, then put my face on the side of the table and vacuum up the remaining crumbs. I didn't have any room for dessert, or to pick at his nachos either. Big portions, of well cooked, delicious, quality food. And if you think you're up for it, you could do the \"Man vs Food Challenge\" and if you're successful, you'll get it for free, and be on the Wall of Fame. Do it!! I dare you!!"}, {"review_id": "jONxSb8OD9bDbzUss0wNeg", "user_id": "BQLc7jSHfPXDvleNFJ6lyg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/16/2018", "text": "I had the Halibut sandwich and it was ok, but not great.

We wanted good fish in a very casual setting and we got it. It has a divey feel to it and not the cleanliest of places, but it's charming and the service was very good. As a big Man V. Food fan, it was a fun surprise seeing he had been there for their seafood challenge ($199!). We ordered the King Crab nuggets to share which were pretty good. I had the original crab roll with smoked salmon chowder and loved it. The chowder was super thick and creamy- highly recommend. My guy ordered the salmon and was happy with it- but was even happier when I got full and he got to eat the rest of my crab roll. Seems like a big place for locals, which is usually a good judge if a place is decent or not.

There was no hesitation, and an obviously freshly fried batch soon appeared.
