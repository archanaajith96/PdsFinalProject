I think the steak is over priced. But the restaurant, service and ambiance we've had every time we've gone has been spot on. I would recommend getting the sausage every time because it's better than the steak and less than half the price! I love Butcher and the Boar because it's always alive.

BBQ, Beef, Bourbon, Boar, not necessarily in any order of preference. Just walking in creates an impression as you are greeted by the stuffed pig head mounted on the wall and the smell of wood smoke and carmelized meat punching you in the olfactory glands. I think the only people that would not be excited to come here would be alcohol averse vegetarians.While this place is not cheap, the food is hand-crafted and top notch. All of the sausages were outstanding, especially the Texas Beef Link which had a great hit of hot chiles in it and the Blood Sausage with brown butter. As good or better than any of the renditions of it I've had in Europe. Accompanied by Shrimp Mac n' Cheese and Fried Green Tomatoes as well as a good bourbon or 2 and I was completely ready to put a confederate flag on my car, dig coal for a living, and marry a cousin upon finishing! The food really is outstanding and you can tell that the kitchen staff is great at what they do. I love the extensive bourbon list but the 1 star discount on this rating is because many on the menu are not available. That is kind of disappointing and each time I ordered, the server apologized and stated that she needed to check with the bartender to see if they had it in stock. She also told me that the bourbon menu had not been updated in about 2 years and that was why it was difficult for her to know if they were out of certain bottles. There were certainly plenty of other ones to choose from when the ones I asked for were not available but our party spent about $80-100/person for the meal with drinks and for that kind of money, I would think that they could make the effort to have an up to date bourbon list. If they could get that under wraps, this would be a 5 star spot no question."}, {"review_id": "6oz3Gyepp2UzwrIJ6nm4yQ", "user_id": "b8RHCCHJJyXDUitnL2Qi5A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Ok, so this is definitely a spot to come to for a date or nice celebration. The dark, cozy atmosphere makes for an enjoyable meal with friends. Because we had a group of 3 college students, we did not order any of the 'good' dishes that were out of our price range, but they did look amazing. I ended up ordering the blood sausage which I actually didn't care for at all. I tried my friend's Berkshire Pork & Cheddar sausage and immediately wished I would have ordered that instead. So, learn from me and try that one first. I also ordered a Surly Hell ($6) from their Tap Beer Menu and a side of Creole Shrimp Mac & Cheese which was delicious- just look at the picture!  My friends ordered the Potato Pave and Red Hot Brussel sprouts and recommended both of those dishes.Overall, the waitstaff was friendly and attentive and I would come back to order that Berkshire Pork sausage and"}, {"review_id": "imBLyCSH-Zf-VBJoU-rrrw", "user_id": "cg_GpiWsO0xKbk1864eKaA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "I came here for the second time but it didn't come out as good as the first time I was here.

The flavor, minor heat with the PB was not expected.  The hot brussel sprouts - is that Hooters wing sauce on there?  I don't care because they rock!Now to brag about my steak.  I'll post up a picture, but I ordered the dry aged NY strip.  When the server asked for how I wanted it cooked I said Pittsburgh (blue).  I must say, I'be dragged a corporate card around the US and canada for 15+ years and this was a top 3 steak.  That good.  They nailed the cook temp and char.  I was so stuffed that I couldn't finish it and took it to the hotel.  Next AM, a little M Lounge steak and Eggs and voila, repurposed.  Can't say enough great things about the restaurant.  Servers were spot on.  Ambience was great, perfect lighting, not too bright or dim where you see everyone cracking out flashlights to read the menu.  Noise level was good even with a full house.Saw an amazing beer menu and on tap selection, although we focused on rarer bourbons on that trip."}, {"review_id": "Jau-TjEmzyfife9vpHiy8g", "user_id": "VuUp3XNKWcFefoQWWCNx4g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Finally!

Keep in mind I'm visiting from Hawaii. The food was great and served family style. Started out with appetizer of the sausage sampler and the charcuterie which also had pâté, the pâté was my favorite. The server recommended to try it on the sausages, very tasty. Dinner was their brined pork, their smoked long ribs, and salmon. The sides were mashed potatoes, fried green tomatoes, caramelized broccolini, & Brussels sprouts! Food: loved the sampler and pâté. Loved the salmon and long ribs. Even with the pork brined it tasted dry and tough. Fried green tomatoes were awesome since Hawaii I never see green tomatoes to buy. All the veggies were good too. Service: excellent & loved how he explained everything and made recommendations on how to eat certain things like adding pâté to the sausage. So good. It was a great experience! Their Moscow Mule was very good!"}, {"review_id": "kNbR_D5c3x5EHWjqFln78w", "user_id": "kFtpOzWygqAENd6oKrkefw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/7/2017", "text": "Any carnivore at heart will marvel at the menu offerings Butcher & The Boar proudly presents. With an atmosphere that resembles that of a steak house with dim lighting and leather chairs, the restaurant also highlights an open kitchen percolating an aroma of smoked meat throughout the entire dining room. Apps such as Wood Grilled Oysters ($17) and Foie Gras Torchon ($18) had all of us in our party agree we were off to a good start. However, one round of drinks and almost an hour later was when our mains started to trickle in. The manager promised to take off some items from our bill to make up for the delay, and let's just say after devouring our plates clean, all was forgotten. The Wild Boar Hot Link ($12) was jam-packed with meat that as we consumed each bite with mustard, we didn't know what hit us. On a whole different league, that Smoked Beef Long Rib ($49) was uber tender, had in-your-face-spice as well as a sweetness from the tobasco and molasses it was doused with fresh from the grill. And the smokiness? On point! Sides such as IPA-Battered Fries were mighty tasty and paired well with our beers while their Cornbread ($6) on a skillet was killer. What catastrophe it may have been if we ended up cancelling it for fear of having over-ordered. Take note, skip the Caramelized Broccoli ($9) if you must but keep the cornbread. We finished off with Chocolate Torte ($9) for dessert and even that was spectacular. With watery eyes from all the smoking action in the kitchen and smelling like we came from a bonfire, we almost had to wheel ourselves out like barrels from everything we consumed by the end of the night.

My dish came with 4 pieces of scallops and a giant serving of slow roasted meat. I have never seen a duck entree as large as they serve it here. There must've been 3 duck breasts, cut up in the dish. The king crab legs were overwhelmingly large and the price reflects it ($66). Definitely shareable as well. Everything was delicious, but surprisingly, the STAR was actually my dessert. The MEYER LEMON POT DE CREME with blackberry whip, honeycomb candy and pistachios was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I don't know how, but it had the perfect amount of sweet, crunch, tartness and textures.

And meat!\"... Sold.This was one of the first restaurants I was brought to in MPLS years ago, and I have been continuing the tradition by bringing out-of-towners here too. It's one of the most (if not THE most) reviewed businesses in the Twin Cities, and for good reason. Butcher & The Boar does a body good (or bad) by offering top-notch cocktails, hearty proteins, and a trendy beer garden.You can't go wrong with any of their sausages, hence their famous sausage sampler plate. The steak tartare was obviously excellent because it was made with and cut dry-aged striploin, dijon aioli, and pickled vegetables. The wood grilled oysters were succulent (kind of a gross word) and swimming in parmesan butter which made for the perfect nutty, buttery, and briney bite.Ask the server about the portion sizes of the main meats and you'll probably end up splitting a plate, since they're usually pretty big. I had the double-cut berkshire pork chop recently and it was basically this big honkin' tomahawk that I could kill a man with. I loved it. The flavors were bold and it was surprisingly very tender!TL;DR Share some apps, try their sausage, share some meats too, and then end the visit on their beer garden.
