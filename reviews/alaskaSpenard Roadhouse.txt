The portion was substantial enough and had to get some to go. The cherry tomato vinaigrette dipping sauce is what I'd like to rave about. It was soooo good we had ask our waiter, Scooter, what it was so we could be Sure to get it again. My goodness the flavored popcorn! Really amazing and I'm not sure how to explain it to make it sound as good as it really is. Btw, we loved Scooter. Very experienced waitperson and welcoming. The vibe was chill, good food, good service. Yes, I encourage you to try it."}, {"review_id": "LtVARsOgfkKC7ElHLv3lfA", "user_id": "Ukc7zpHtX2UJ29UOYplxKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Increasing my rating based on today's experience alone.  Attended a business lunch and was warmly greeted by Joel who then asked us if any of us had any allergies he need to know about.  Being gluten and soy free, you know that won major points with me.  He even went as far as checking with the kitchen to make sure my garden salad with ranch and organic chicken didn't have anything in it that would spark my allergy.  The salad was great and the grilled chicken was perfectly cooked.  Joel was probably one of the best servers I have had in many years.  Definitely was an enjoyable lunch.  I will be back.  I'm especially appreciative of Joel going out of the way to be so conscientious for those of us with food allergies.  Thank you!"}, {"review_id": "Psdb9cPEpYI_eIP-1NS2rg", "user_id": "lNYz33dEk-l7CwTH7YdUhA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "We came here on a busy Friday night, but only waited about 15 minutes for a table. Our server was nice and very cheerful. We got the bacon of the month to start and it was delicious.Boyfriend got the black garlic chicken rigatoni and the serving was more than enough for two people. I personally don't understand portions that are so huge, especially when it comes with a tiny, thin piece of sliced chicken. It was like the chicken was an afterthought and didn't belong. The pasta, however irregularly portioned, was delicious. I got the veggie dinner, with garlic (purple) mashed potatoes, green beans & roasted garlic, and the fried brussels sprouts. High note was the mashed potatoes, the were delicious and tasted of garlic and butter! I could swim laps in these potatoes! The greens beans were nice and crisp, could have been cooked in less oil/butter. The brussels sprouts were tasty, but maybe overcooked and tasted too much of oil. Again, the portions are crazy. Half a plate of fried brussels sprouts, who's going to eat all that or want to reheat it??We shared a plate of tiny super tots, minus green onions. They came to us with green onions, but our server noticed right away and fixed it. Still, tots were flashed a little too much because some of the cheese was hardened instead of melted. At best, it was a 3 star experience for us. The menu options were odd and quirky (I'm talking about apple slices on a burger). The portions are unpleasantly huge. The style of cuisine just wasn't for us. We may give it another try down the road, but I can't see us coming back any time soon."}, {"review_id": "8dwwcyqZVdIAq028ALPQKw", "user_id": "r84LCGY4FRL6tY52rWG3TQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Overall, really enjoy hitting up Spenard Roadhouse! We often take friends from out of town for an enjoyable causal meal.  Service is always good! They changed up the Cobb Salad which is a bummer, I don't care for it like I use to when they first opened.  It's still good but not great and I don't go there for that anymore.  Calamari is super tasty, Cubano Sandwich and really like the Fig, Goat Cheese & Prosciutto pizza! Bombdiggity! Yum! Many years ago, their bacon of the month was a bacon taco with pickled onions and so tasty that I still dream of it, wishing it would come back!"}, {"review_id": "oeCRtvZIIG-GbXeBVf2NWA", "user_id": "8NzUBQpgiu_o7777-lOj2g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Spenard Roadhouse is local classic.

They had a lot of unique items.  Ranging from their Super Tots to the best darn bacon jam burger I've ever had.  Pumpkin cheesecake isn't anything to rave about.  It was frozen in the middle which leads me to believe it's shipped or stored in the freezer and not fresh.  Was fine but would recommend their other deserts. If you're visiting I do highly recommend visiting the Spenard Roadhouse.  Local establishment and quite tasty."}, {"review_id": "D98lyVlAu2BJnSbUGzwdlQ", "user_id": "mMeEaMl4ou3jgiYe_lK6ow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "It's been a while since I've eaten here, but either way it's amazing.

I had the curry which was really good, more on the spicy side. We had a side of sweet potato tots that were also super yummy. I would definitely come back.

They always have good food, great drinks, and awesome atmosphere.On this visit my husband, four year old, and I were able to nab a table outside with no wait, this doesn't happen often, and was a welcome treat on such a beautiful day! My husband had an Avocado Melt with super-tots, I had the Thai curry with a mini side of super-tots, and our daughter had a pepperoni pizza.Our server was prompt and made a great drink recommendation for me, the house old fashioned. He always made sure we had our glasses full and needed nothing. The main dishes were, as usual, very good. Both were light enough for such a warm day, but filling enough to keep us going. This was also the first time my daughter tried the pepperoni pizza, and after her little belly was full to bursting she proclaimed it was the \"Best Pizza Ever!\" (Granted she says this for every meal she eats, but new things are always a gamble, so I was pleased she loved it.)My husband and I absolutely love the super-tots here, which is why we both ordered them... there's no way am I going to share. Deep fried tater-tots, with melted cheese, sour cream, bacon ad green onion! Cant get any better!Out drinks were also top notch. My old fashioned had a house made maraschino cherry, that really made it pop and my husband enjoyed two different IPA's from their well rounded list of beers.Overall this restaurant is easily my favorite in town. It is conveniently located, the menu choices and specials are always flavorful, interesting, and even inventive (try the bacon of the month if you can!) Even if there is a wait, and there usually is Thurs-Sun, it is well worth it to grab a drink at the bar and wait for a table!"}, {"review_id": "6Lifots93g7UOaft8eBz2g", "user_id": "NiHVAPlz_nKzloEelatLvg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/2/2018", "text": "If you go hope you run into Orion the bartender, he is the best!

Parking is free ... and, like the restaurant, bar, and patio, it's packed. Be prepared for a wait or a long wait.Luckily, the food & drinks are worth the delay. We started with a Strawberry Lemonade for her and an Oosik Amber Ale for me before sharing a menagerie of irresistible Yelp recommendations. * Bacon Deviled Eggs on Fried Green Tomatoes (5 stars) * AK Salmon with Soba Noodles (4 stars) * Fried Calamari Strips (3 stars) * Super Tots - Cheese, Bacon & Sour Cream (5 stars) * Wild Mushroom Truffle Pizza (2 stars) * Blackened Fried Brussels Sprouts (3 stars) * Salmon Carpaccio (4 stars)There's something for everyone at Spenard Roadhouse. Actually, there's about 8 things for everyone which is why it's the busiest diner in all of Anchorage.
