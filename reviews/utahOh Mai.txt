It's my favorite spot for Bahn Mi and Pho in Salt Lake, the food is fresh and always DELICIOUS! I love that they offer such a wide variety of options and the fact that they have a kids menu. You can get the Bahn Mi's in a lettuce wrap instead of a baguette but their baguettes are made fresh and ROCK! They have things for the everyone, the meat lovers, vegans, and gluten-free! My favorites are the S4 - Vegan Bahn Mi, it roasted rice powder, potato and bean thread noodles and the sauces make it sweet, spicy and tangy, its perfect! The S10 - Sunny Side up is also a favorite of mine. For Pho my favorites are - P4 Ribeye, P9 is the veggie with beef broth and my favorite vegan Pho is the P3 Tofu and veggie with vegetable both. Their pho is packed full of flavor. They have spring rolls they make in house daily that are also very good. Everything is fresh and delicious, and the service is always great. Food comes out fast and correct everytime."}, {"review_id": "93LnW3zm-G8VgZ-bIoqbVg", "user_id": "TACQczyMJpmIgM5G-Pqxew", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/15/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Made a special trip to try their sandwiches.  The place was almost empty with just one other customer waiting for his sandwich and 4 workers and the two owners.  I paid for my sandwich at 10am and waited as it was \"being made\" ... And waited ... 20 min later I asked how much longer, and they said they are currently working on it ... 5 minutes later they tell me they ran out.  In short, they lied.   I cancelled.  I had a plan to catch.l have no idea if the food is good.  But the service was terrible.  How could it remotely take 20min to make a sandwich when the place was essentially empty?Price wise it was New York prices"}, {"review_id": "b7T5affaUx5gbHA5dSCrFg", "user_id": "etKCJBNhv-vnflshi4r-Pw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "Oh Mai is a favorite locally owned restaurant. The fresh dishes range from spring rolls, bánh mì sandwiches, and delicious phó. If you've never been, you need to go try it at least once! My go-to favorite is the yellow curry chicken báhn mì. It is such a flavorful sandwich with all sorts of great textures and flavors. There are a few Oh Mai restaurants open across the valley now because their food is so good. In fact, they were nationally recognized and featured on The Food Network's program Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. Five stars for quality of sandwiches, fresh ingredients, and excellent prices."}, {"review_id": "lufl6xCXeKX3AwY751gBwg", "user_id": "JtRHOHqpuomtRsvJ1tSpSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Stopped in today after doing some shopping.  I have had their sandwiches before when it was ordered for a work lunch but this was my first time in the shop itself. Quaint little space with a few small tables, picnic style tables and benches and large round table.  You go up to the counter to order and then they bring it to you when it's ready. Husband ordered the honey glazed pork banh mi and I ordered the vegan.  The bread is so crisp on the outside and the sandwich is packed with filling. I ordered mine with no carrots or jalapeno but it still had a little kick to it. But not intolerable since I can't handle any spice.  The veggies inside the sandwiches were crisp and fresh.  And everything comes together to make for a flavor packed meal! Husband really enjoyed his as this was his first time here.  The pork was not overpowering and the glaze was just sweet enough to compliment the salty meat. The veggies offered with the sandwiches are unique and not something you find everywhere making these special.  I never thought to put cilantro on a sandwich!! So good!!! They didn't come with any sides but it was so hearty the sandwich alone was enough.  And all reasonably priced (two sandwiches and a soda for $13!!)Husband said the pho looked amazing too so we will have to come back to try it. Bathrooms clean, friendly and fast service and a great little spot to come in for a quick meal without eating like you're at a fast food restaurant."}, {"review_id": "UJqFcj8xiP3If0PQ8ZjxaQ", "user_id": "CnMqxAS6qZMJghsY6_uIOw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Was hoping this place would be off the hook.

It is my favorite go to Pho in Salt lake. However, I am disappointed to find that they have switched from reusable dishes to plastic. They state that they have changed due to customers throwing away bowls and spoons. Plastic is a waste, and environmentally irresponsible. I think there are innovative ways to continue to use dishes, busing tables, moving bins around etc. likely will not return and find another Pho restaurant that uses reusable dishes."}, {"review_id": "IROfOVY18R2bZoc9b4cXjw", "user_id": "h9LPugJk2cpIh0gmQb5LnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/28/2017", "text": "Best sandwich I have had in quite a while.  Our Uber driver suggested the place and so we came in here to grab a quick sandwich before a Christmas Eve movie.  The place is fast casual style and had a line.  There was one table left and we snagged it.  Our food came out really fast - a honey pork bahn mi and the Korean bahn mi along with a bowl of beef pho.  The pho was a recommendation and while it was good, I think that I am just not a fan of pho in general.  Those sandwiches though...so yummy!   They were perfectly balanced and full of flavor.  The bread had just the right texture.  Absolutely perfect sandwiches overall.   Loved it and wish I could transplant the place to Pittsburgh."}, {"review_id": "p_wlpynzdm1vdeaVDiwQmQ", "user_id": "1nQgh9EsgAF-KpJ-hxIkfQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/4/2017", "text": "Came here for dinner on a Monday night. Parking wasn't too bad, they should have spots to the right of the building.

Both were amazinnng. I'm skeptical of vegetarian pho because I've had really terrible ones before but they actually do a good job here. The banh mi was incredible - amazing flavors and adding hoisin sauce to everything is a must.Very good food, will have to come back to check out other items on their menu."}, {"review_id": "dgMVWtgZwZmkVoRnF5Lpzw", "user_id": "3Njmjxj9OS2F0G1bT2OZGg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Oh Mai is my absolute favorite place to go to lunch.

I ate here before I was a vegetarian, and now that I am the food is hit or miss for me. The vegan bahn mi and the lemongrass tofu are both great. However, I didn't care for the vegan pho at all. The broth was completely tasteless. I was surprised by how much they increased their prices too. I used to be able to get a sandwich for 3$ there, and now it's 6$. 100% price increase is pretty steep. One other complaint is I am an out and proud cilantro hater and I ask them every time to leave the cilantro out and they never remember. Despite these issues, the food is still excellent and worth checking out."}, {"review_id": "MxAyScu5BHwG_TkkCGNWVQ", "user_id": "R2zmEyz76b4Y9b9ZzosP0w", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "For all the hype this place gets I was expecting significantly better food. The location is in a semi-ghetto part of town, but to be honest that got me excited as I really love hole in the wall eateries. The design was great - reminded me somewhat of something you'd see in Bali in terms of decor and layout. The food ordering process is very efficient and the prices are incredibly fair. I got both pho and banh mi (honey-glazed) the banh mi was pretty good, definitely something I'd be happy to order again. The Pho left something to be desired and didn't have all the flavors you'd normally expect. Overall, quite content with the food.

It's the kind of place you walk up to order, and you can watch your food being made in the front kitchen. Vegans rejoyce, for they offer quite a few vegetarian options including vegetarian and vegan banh mi sandwiches, a vegan pho, and a vegan vermicelli noodle salad. S10: Sunny Side Up Egg Banh Mi Sandwich ($4.88): I was blown away by this sandwich. The crust was crunchy yet easy to bite into, and didn't cut my mouth like some baguettes tend to. The caramelized onions, scallions, daikon, and cilantro made this gooey sandwich super flavorful. I've never had anything like it. For under $5, you're getting away with highway robbery. P3: Vegan Tofu & Vegi Pho (small $6.38): No lie, this might be the best veggie pho I've had in my life. It's all about the broth, which was savory, herbal, and rich. You know its good when you don't have to add any plum or soy sauces to pump up the flavor. The fried tofu is cut into long strips, which I appreciated, and all of the vegetables were fresh. I do recommend adding some of the chili oil for some extra spicy oompf. The small was more than enough for one person. Someone took the time to think out the small details of the restaurant, from the decor to the offerings. They have a hot and cold water fountain, and all utensils, napkins, and sauces laid out. The to-go cartons are also laid out for your taking. Also, be kind and bus your own table. They have a tub for the dirty dishes on the trash can by the door."}, {"review_id": "NfudZFSWrW8F3EIWeGR0cg", "user_id": "UvQMhmJIAvzRJMLz7J4tWQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/27/2017", "text": "Oh Mai, Mai...
