Our party of 6 all got the chicken shawarma and it was perfect. I've had my share of shawarmas although I'm not of Arabic descent and I  can say I have never been fully impressed, but after eating this I'm obsessed. They had this whole chicken that was being grilled that looked pretty But here's the catch, the place is very deceiving as it looks quite rundown but don't let that deter you. I highly suggest you give this place a try, you won't regret it."}, {"review_id": "uNYZI10T0a9uhYhL4ZcRMQ", "user_id": "NbuNkgEJnk2kpq7KavBIHQ", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I waited my turn at the counter to order for 10-15 minutes. Other customers walked in and ordered without delay. The workers continuously ignored me in favor of Arab speaking (or looking) customers.  I ended up walking out and going for shawarma elsewhere where I was treated with dignity and respect. This behavior is unacceptable. I've been to numerous other restaurants in Paterson over a period of around 10years and have never experienced this discrimination.

Whenever I encounter that, I get excited. Right when you walk in you can smell the shawarma. I had the chicken shawarma with French fries. It comes with a garlic sauce that gave it a nice kick. I saw everyone grab a yogurt drink and did the same. Great experience and a good place to grab a bit if you are around Paterson."}, {"review_id": "IZSnzL0Gr1UBmrqkoyn-0A", "user_id": "73VaZiq5Sezi-Ibnl7wnSw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/3/2016", "text": "I've yet to scratch the surface here but the chicken sandwich I had here thrice was truly amazing.The well marinated and spiced chicken Schawarma is incredible. Layers of thinly sliced chicken mingled with fresh herbs (i also detected fresh mint leaves) wrapped in traditional Syrian bread, a square and paper thin wrap that is rolled with the meat and also pickles I detected. The sandwich is excellent but you may want to order two, or bring some friends and have them make you a platter of these cut up and served with the white garlic dipping sauce as I've seen in other yelpers photos from here. I filled up on one but I've seriously gotten used to smaller portions in 2016 (lost over 70lbs).When asked for a menu I was told there wasn't one but upon further inspection I was told the old menu in the photos is no longer valid and you're best bet is to ask the counter person what is available that day. There are apps like baba ganouj and hummus, there's also need shawarma on Saturdays (I think, check), there's also shish kebab skewers and an excellent salad.My 3rd visit I got bold and asked for a custom platter fit for a diabetic: chicken schwarma over salad with baba and hummus sides for an impressive $11. Its fantastic! Same great meat, but in an open sandwich form and they forgot my salad and added a few fries, will have to be more specific next time, but I'm definitely on to something here.Looking forward to trying it all here."}, {"review_id": "aYavw4Gz86bLfFDMp7hznA", "user_id": "Py5AJboAP7rFixUns4BFBw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Worst service ever!

Finally there is s place that makes them reeeeal good. There are so many interpretations of shawarma in the area that are lacking if not one ingredient more.

Very Tasty!!!I travelled all the way from Long Island, NY and it was worth every mile travelled.

Every single time i eat from Al Shami it gets better and better! Monday-Friday they have chicken shawrma, weekend they have meat shawrma.

Ive heard so many good things about Syrian shawrma and finally i tried some, and it is definitely the best shawrma i ever had. Syrians know the secret to good shawrma.
