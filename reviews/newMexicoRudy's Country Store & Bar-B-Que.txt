The ribs are still very good but the \"moist\" brisket I ordered wasn't that great. It didn't even have that nice black bark it used to have. The Bar BQ sauce isn't the same as the original neither, just doesn't taste the same. Maybe because is missing anchovies? LOL I guess business is still good, but why change a good thing? Keep the recipes and cooking techniques the same because after, the original way is what helped you grow."}, {"review_id": "TbOSeMXLksH-XiUAEip4Tw", "user_id": "dlp-HY0R6WqcBGH64aMF_Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/12/2018", "text": "I've been going to this location for quite some time now.

Seriously, this is the most tender brisket ever.  Just melts in your mouth. It started with samples of brisket and turkey because I was a newbie. The turkey was JUICY and so damn good. New potatoes were cooked perfectly. The cole slaw was amazing and exactly how I like it, crisp but creamy.  Sweet corn on the cob reminds me of warm summer days. Anyway, another thing is that the place is so clean.  It's a BBQ place and you know you can always catch some sort of filth.  Condiments are dirty or greasy floors or tables.  Not here !Note to owner;Your place is great!!  Please open up another in Denver, Colorado.  Let's get some investors. It's a WIN WIN for everybody. I can't wait till I'm in the area again.

I guess Rudy's is pretty popular in New Mexico and the surrounding states, but we don't have one back in California that I know of. Rudy's offers all of the smoked meats with all the fixings. // SERVICE //I thought the service here was excellent. It was our first time so they gave us a little sampler of the lean brisket, moist brisket, and smoked turkey. Leonard helped us out and he was very helpful and gave us great information on each of the sides and meats. // FOOD // Moist brisket: Moist, delicious! Must order! 5/5Lean brisket: Very lean. Good smoked flavor, but dry. 2.5/5Smoked turkey breast: Slightly dry, but surprisingly good flavor. 3/5Jalapeño sausage: Really good flavor! Not too much kick though. 4/5Jumbo smoked potato with pulled pork: I loved how the pulled pork wasn't covered in sauce. It had a slightly vinegar taste to it which was a nice change from the rest of the meat. 4/5Green chile stew: Very comforting. Not much spice. 3.5/5New potatoes: Boiler potatoes covered in melted butter. 3/5Coleslaw: Perfect for breaking down the fatty meats. 4/5Overall, I really liked the BBQ meats and fixings at Rudy's. They also have really good BBQ sauce and they give tons of complimentary bread. Choice of white or wheat. If you're in the area and craving BBQ, I would highly recommend stopping by Rudy's for some delicious BBQ!"}, {"review_id": "ruJojbonRQAlzMlgNIAyvw", "user_id": "mXgXADhPlIVHuwNjGkHHCw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "In my effort to find good bbq in the ABQ I got a lot of recommendations for this one.

The meal did not agree with either one of us with her waking around 1 am violently ill and me following suit around 3 am.

I do love me some BBQ so I was secretly excited to, although sadly, I was suffering from a head cold so all food was turning me off at that point.It was pretty kick ass to find out that Rudy's is ready to serve you BBQ starting at 7am, cause this girl loves some juicy meat in the morning! My husband got a 1/2 lbs of pulled pork and a 1/2 pound of brisket, and I got a 1/2 pound of turkey and a 1/2 chicken. Don't be deceived by how small the bag of food is that they give you, they pack all that meat very well... When finally on the plane (security almost took our BBQ), we ripped into our goodies... My husband was over the moon in tastebud heaven with his pulled pork, and really did like his brisket too, but decided to save most of it for sandwiches the next day (we didn't have a long flight so it kept). I on the other hand was EXTREMELY disappointed. The turkey was okay, but DRY. If I had some mustard and/or ketchup with me, it would have been okay... or an avocado, ya, that would have been a good addition too. The chicken however, bleh! Bland and so boring. Not juicy at all. It's as if they don't really season the chicken at all, and just let the BBQ sauces take over, but what about those who don't like SAUCY BBQ...? IE: what about me?! I ate a chicken leg, and immediately said to myself that this chicken needs some condiments so it's best to save it for when I get home. For me not to finish my meat is unheard of, and my husband knew at that point that (and when I actually offered to share my food with him) I truly was sick, and not feeling well, at all. Ha!We shall see how the chicken tastes with some condiments, but I feel as though I'm basically going to be forcing myself to eat it because I don't like food waste. Let's just say, I will never take a detour to get Rudy's BBQ ever again. I almost wish the airport security took it?

If you are a BBC sauce connoisseur, then you may not be thrilled with Rudy's Bar-B-Q or Sissy Sauce (basically HOT or NOT).This is a great place to pick-up items for a company lunch or family picnic! The seating is basically long picnic benches, so you get to know your neighbors.

I wouldn't go so far as to say I was awe-struck, but I did have a moment where my life flashed before my eyes and I asked myself, \"where has Rudy's been all of my life?\" The obvious answer was that it had been right in this location, among others, but the underlying answer is that Rudy's is not the typical hipster-foodie establishment that I would frequent. That's a shame, because the meat here is *quite* good. After a short wait in line, we were called up to order. \"Is this your first time at Rudy's?\", the cashier asked. My wild-eyed look must have given me away. \"Yes,\" I responded, and I was immediately treated to samples of the moist brisket, lean brisket, and smoked turkey. All three were delicious, but might I recommend avoiding the word \"moist\" as that seems to be a turn-off to many nowadays. I ordered the green chile stew,  corn on the cob, and a rice Krispy treat, because this was a work-reimbursed lunch and so I could splurge on dessert. The corn on the cob was bland, even with the extra dousing of butter it appeared to be bathed in. The green chile stew was heavenly - not too thin, not too spicy, and just the right amount of delicious smoky meat. The rice Krispy treat fared as do most - it's hard to screw up riced cereal, marshmallow, and sugar. It was, in a word, divine. Thoroughly satiated, I mentally filed a note to come back for more stew the next time I got sick - it's the kind of stew that'll kick a head cold in the butt. I rolled out of Rudy's with a full belly and happy spirit."}, {"review_id": "Mw2FMYqH9-RycSeERBtStw", "user_id": "p1dRNX_kHedZ9MzmorlUug", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "Awesome.  Best BBQ spot I've been to in my life.  The brisket is awesome.  The smoked turkey is awesome.  The banana pudding...
