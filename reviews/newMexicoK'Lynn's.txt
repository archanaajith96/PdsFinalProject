The jerk chicken with red beans and rice topped with plantain was so delicious I had a hard time making myself stop eating! The fried okra reminds me of my mamaws (obviously the best ever made). My boyfriend said the gumbo was some of the best he's ever had! We even splurged on dessert... chicory coffee and fresh from the oven peach cobbler! Absolutely scrumptious! I have a new favorite restaurant... I highly recommend you pay them a visit!"}, {"review_id": "CsAq2tvTNgDMrP8kbVcxwQ", "user_id": "5aEpsfK9laECnMs7WcjTPQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/16/2018", "text": "OMG, Im not I sure I could contain the excitement of having a southern/creole spot so close to the house. Let me say that their shrimp and grits is to die for, and the amount of food you get for the the price is almost a crime. I feel almost like Im committing robbery LOL. They have daily specials, and their menu is pretty small, as to not overwhelm your palette. They are open Wed- Sat and often they have an \"early bird\" special on Saturdays where they are opened earlier than normal to serve beignets and other goodiesThe only reason why they have a 4 instead of 5 star??? They aren't open on Sundays. This would be the best place to visit for brunch after Sunday Service. #MaybeSoon"}, {"review_id": "mxfB6n7HxOeM94JrXSW5gw", "user_id": "267f_IFzwrvgLi2OXXEt_Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "First time going here and it was amazing! I got the fried catfish with Mac and cheese and cornbread, husband got the crawfish po'boy. Catfish was excellent, Mac and cheese was a little dry for my preference but I'm not a huge baked Mac and cheese person. Husband was in love with the po'boy with the Cajun remoulade and raved about it. Finished dinner off with the best piece of restaurant pecan pie I've ever had. We will definitely be back! Also the staff was very friendly."}, {"review_id": "V2DOZzfz1d-Je6GbpiEevQ", "user_id": "OjGj7XeslfUEdxwuWfZ6bw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Stick with the fried food for consistently good food. The gumbo is yet another failed example of an attempt at Cajun...the etoufée was only slightly better.  Apparently the cooks have no understanding of how to properly prepare a darkened roux, but as any South Louisiana cook will tell you,  if the roux is not right then stop, trash it, and try again. Here, it was like the gumbo was in a thick light gray gravy...inedible and unacceptable.I came here wanting to like K'Lynns but was very disappointed with the lack of knowledge in the preparation of the Louisiana side of the menu. But again, the fried foods were good and I will go back at some point for more of their fried offerings."}, {"review_id": "gIshRonzHJG2Es_BBy22yQ", "user_id": "KgoaYqhK618UZjDZTfE8XA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "Went in to K'lynns by recommendation of my nextdoor app neighbors. Everyone raved about it!I'm not much of a seafood person so I ordered the fried chicken special with a side of okra. My husband had the crawfish etouffe. The food was delicious!!  Service was fast and food was hot and fresh. Kids menu was pretty limited, but my daughter ordered the mac n cheese side and loved it.All in all we had a pleasant experience. Prices were reasonable. One thing I didn't much care for was the atmosphere. I feel like location could be better. It was pretty hot inside on an already hot summer day. We ordered a peach cobbler to share before we left. It was amazing as well. We will be back. They also offer take out and catering!"}, {"review_id": "OmV6cPOPp8p4Y4wsLki3gw", "user_id": "0qlCnKu7ib6K5stti2vzaw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "We just tried K'Lynn's right here in Rio Rancho. Wow. This place rivals any place we have been in Louisiana. A limited menu, but as long as they have a shrimp po-boy I'm happy. The fried pickles were better than ones in the South and the pecan pie was delicious also. The french fries are made from real potatoes, not frozen. This is now my favorite restaurant in the Albuquerque/Rio Rancho area."}, {"review_id": "L7Mpt4F04Ip5OYEaoolAQw", "user_id": "rBb9O2nBUoJfebWbmM8bSg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Today, my team from work picked up a variety of dishes for lunch.

Back when I was a lower enlisted solder stationed at Ft Polk waiting to deploy in combat there were two comforts, booze and great food. In our craft brewery revolution its easy to find a great watering hole; but those small establishments where food is made with love and passion that replenish your soul are hard to find. Friends look no farther.Every time I eat here I get goosebumps; I'm transformed back to that 20 year old kid who had no taste of war sinking his teeth into that first po'boy; that first bite of étouffée; that first bite of comfort away from home. I learned that you ca find solace in food no matter where you are, and K'lynns reminds me of that every time.

Truly authentic and the portions are more than enough! I felt like family made my lunch even though I'm from nowhere near Cajun food country. This is on my short list of first choices of where to eat. I do suggest that they \"spruce the place up a bit. \" It sorta feels like I'm visiting my poor cousin with the mom that always cooks the yummy food. I will be back if they let me after I just said that!Almost forgot, their days/hours are SHORT.

Met K'Lynn and her very friendly, welcoming employees and we were so impressed by how everyone really cared if we were enjoying or meal. Bright colors on the wall and comfortable seating combined to offer a pleasant dining room.Hubby had the catfish entrée that is served on rice with crawfish etouffee. It was served with a side of fried okra as well. He absolutely loved it and said he'd definitely order it again. I had the popcorn shrimp basket with fries and tartar sauce. Great dinner that we both enjoyed. We're already planning on returning and plan to spread the word to friends. If you have a hankering for good, solid comfort food with a Cajun twist, this is the place for you!This restaurant is tucked on the side of the Target / Albertson's shopping center on Ridgecrest (Just off the 528 in Rio Rancho). It is around the far side of Albertson's between Papa John's and Planned Parenthood. You can't really see it at all from 528 so just turn in as if you were going to Albertson's. It may be a little hard to find, but the flavorful food and friendly greeting you'll enjoy make this restaurant well worth the effort to find it."}, {"review_id": "UVWbEYhDA8cchxCtUW0lVw", "user_id": "krFe1V0HHxUeDd3rEK0clg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/28/2017", "text": "There's a new kid on the block and they are a welcome addition to Rio Rancho.  Catfish, jerk chicken and fried okra were all delish.
