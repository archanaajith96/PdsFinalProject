The inside was nice. I ordered the horchata latte which was sooo amazing! Creamy, cinnamony, not too sweet, not too bitter.. definitely good I also got the huevos rancheros which was definitely hyped up by other people on yelp.. probably the WORST huevos rancheros I've ever had... I even had my friends try it to see if I was just crazy and my taste buds were off.. it literally just tasted like tomato..there was no other real flavor.. the tortilla in the bowl was the WORST part.. it didn't have that crunch but instead was STALE... as if they had this plate just sitting out and soaked up all the tomato and was just sitting there.. it made the dish completely unappetizing.. only took a few bites and set the dish aside and finished my latte.. Truly truly disappointed especially with the sign outside that says top 100 breakfast spots in AMERICA...the other food looked amazing... but who knows we could be talking the same scenario.. ‚Äç Anywho, maybe that was an off day? It seems like other people really enjoy this place... but it was a little bit of a buzzkill for my friends and I!"}, {"review_id": "yogbnhLjw2pN0VUaVh5Euw", "user_id": "bTKvZww6jUwrn6QroV6KQg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "This place should be named Cafe KaPOW!!

After I went the first time with a friend, I had to go back the following week with the wife.. Boi!!This spot is legit! I got the french toast, which came with the gooey glazed jawns which was a nice addition, but I also asked for syrup on the side, to \"drizzle\" over the french toastThe french toast honestly is the best french toast that I have ever had, to date! Jawns had a nice \"crisp\" break/crunch to it.. Not that soggy thin bread you normally get I also got a side for scrambled eggs and cheese, that was pretty good.. The cheese they use is \"different\" not sure which or what kind of cheese it is, but it isn't your standard shredded cheese you get at like waffle house (lol)..

I spent hours searching for the perfect birthday lunch spot. I wanted to love you, Cafe Kacao, but I just can't. My husband and I both ordered the Crispy Motuleno. The eggs are prepared to order, or so they say. He ordered sunny side up and I ordered over medium. The food arrived and my husbands eggs were over easy, not sunny side up. My eggs were over easy, not over medium. I asked the server about my husbands eggs and he said sunny side up is the same as over easy. That's not true, of course. I showed him my eggs and asked if that's how their over medium usually looks. I got a reply of a really long \"ummmmmm....\" and then a \"do you want me to have them remake them?\" I ate around the eggs that weren't cooked to order. I didn't have time to wait for another meal.

They make sure my coffee cup is always full and fresh, and they're so fast that sometimes I wonder if I ever took a drink.

Everyone is right. I ordered the Cobanero Omelette. Cafe Kacao isn't chintzy with the ingredients. The omelette is already big and then they go and stuff it full of carne asada and pico de gallo. It tasted like a good omelette, but the cobanero pepper sauce is what pushed it to a whole 'nother level. It's creamy, rich, and spicy (but not too spicy). I could keep going but you get the point. It's fantastic! If you don't get the Cobanero Omelette, get the sauce on the side (if you don't mind paying extra for it). The beans weren't too bad. I'm not a huge fan of beans in general, but the black beans were a pleasant surprise. Normally I barely even touch them, but I got through a decent amount. They also have a huge coffee menu which is pretty impressive just by the sheer size of it. The Nutella drinks were enticing but I just went with a normal cup of coffee. It was okay. The service was fine. Our server was nice, but a little inattentive. We came in around 12:30, so it was understandably packed. Once we ordered, we got our food quickly, but she forgot about the coffee I ordered. I got it about 30 minutes later, so it wasn't a huge deal. The worst thing about Cafe Kacao is how annoying it is to find a spot here. The parking lot is so small and cramped that you'll probably have an easier time parking in the lot across the street, but even that second lot isn't a sure thing. Pro-tip: get here early if you can. You'll probably have to wait 20-30 minutes if you show up during lunch time, but breakfast, I'm told, doesn't really have much of a wait. Cafe Kacao is easily one of the best breakfast/brunch places in the Oklahoma City area. I'm pretty sure I'll be back soon."}, {"review_id": "rMQdE94kmnJOs_ZILrm0eg", "user_id": "OPSgzQ3vuAhh3vcMIzuiNg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "My boyfriend and I decided that we liked this place so much, it was worth eating here twice before we left.

Just a little difficult to eat with a fork because of the crispy tortillas. All the flavors were showing and the presentation was spectacular. It was cooked perfectly and the plantains had just the right sweetness to them. My mom ordered the Tikal. The flank steak has a great seasoned flavor and was cooked to perfection as well. The longaniza to me was like a very well seasoned hamburger. Not what I was expecting when I tried it. We had a few of their signature cafes and they were all fantastic. If you're craving sweet and different you must try the coffee flip that has egg white in it.

Essentially,- The food's tasty, whatever you decide on will probably be a good choice.- Expect a wait, anywhere from 15-45 minutes. Don't expect a quick breakfast/lunch here.- Service is hit-or-miss. There's an older guy server who does a fantastic job. Everyone else is kinda lacking.I'm okay with the wait times and service inconsistencies because the food (as previously mentioned) is really good. What I find annoying about Cafe Kacao, however, is this crazy need for them to upcharge you for everything. Every item I ordered, I asked for a slight change and it was met with a \"sure, but it'll be extra\"Couple examples:\"I'm not the biggest fan of the black beans that come with the cobanero omelette, can you substitute it for some plantains?\"\"Sure, but it'll cost extra.\"\"Understandable enough, can I switch it out for refried beans instead?\"\"Absolutely, but we're going to charge for it.\"\"On these Huevos Rancheros, can I do flour tortillas instead of the corn ones?\"\"Mmm maybe, but there'll probably be a charge for it.\"(After getting a to-go box for our pancakes) \"Can we get a little thing of that condensed milk sauce you put on top?\" \"Sure thing! It'll cost extra for that, though.\"That last one annoyed me the most. I paid $12 for 2 pancakes with sauce on top, give me a break with these upcharges Kacao.

That's how good this spot is and a review almost isn't even necessary, but here we go anyways.Small, run down looking restaurant on the outside. Possibly a remodeled fast food location but not sure. But the inside is a dim but pretty nice looking area with relaxed decor.Both times I've been here, and the service has been excellent. The first time I had a very kind Hispanic looking man, and the second time was an awesome server named Dan. He told us his name after we left, but I made sure to look at his name on the receipt anyways because that's how great he was. He took his time to recommend dishes, give advice on the menu, etc. We told him that we eat a lot but he saved us from ordering too much food and man oh man, I'm glad he warned us because Cafe Kacao does not skimp out on the portions. They are officially Fatty¬© approved. But back to Dan, after convincing us that we didn't need two sets of pancakes and that my friend and I should just share, he even cut our pancakes for us to put on the separate plates. Excellent service that makes you want to come back and visit. The food is great and very fresh tasting. The first visit I had the Crispy Motuleno which was basically steak and eggs on crispy tortillas. Everything from the protein and refried beans down to the plantains were great. I had the Creamy Cilantro Burrito the second time and I definitely recommend that if you're hungry. That doesn't mean I don't have any complaints though. All of the tortilla strips were stale and there was quite a bit of rice in the burrito, some chunks of it being plain white rice too. The beans weren't great and I now know to ask for the refried option instead. The chorizo potatoes were good but nothing to write home about. Not much heat at all, but the meat was tasty, although it kind of tasted like ground beef but more sausagey, if that makes any sense. The potatoes could have been more crunchy and better seasoned but still good. The pancakes were amazing and HUGE and are now second on my list of best pancakes I've had. You really need to split that with a friend and add that to the meal. Very traditional pancake batter taste but the sauce was really good on this option. Both times I've been, wait times were non-existent but I know they can get very busy. You can check in with the Yelp app I think but I haven't done that yet and have had no issues coming during lunch/dinner hours. I will be coming back for sure because there is so much I want to eat on the menu. I'd really like to try out some more sweet and savory items along with their coffee/tea selections which seems to have great reviews."}, {"review_id": "K1tDxlRqvh0Sx1uCXLFczQ", "user_id": "Tbbjx_S6y_oSMQrAiPwdHA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Woah, I'm so surprised I haven't already written a review regarding Kacao. This used to be my favorite spot during my undergrad years over at OCU. They've significantly expanded their menu items over the year & now open for dinner (which is really, really nice when you're craving some delicious brunch food), as well as have coffee/tea options. I also appreciate how they've begun giving a little appetizer...usually a chicken-styled soup (at least the last 2 times I went).My usual is huevos rancheros, motuleno, french toast and/or the blueberry/oreo pancakes. You can never go wrong with any of the pancakes -- trust me!! Over the years, though, I've noticed that going during the weekend brunch time rush can be overwhelming -- it might just be me, but I always feel rushed to eat quick due to them needing to flip tables. I recommend going during dinner on a weeknight for a more quiet & non-rushed experience. :)Finally, the dinner options I'm sure are equally tasty, but I'm a creature of habit & I always stick with their famous brunch. :)"}, {"review_id": "nu_5cssnN0DD1N4uWI-uPA", "user_id": "NFDHzumce7GcmneYdS8ZeA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "This place was different but definitely good.

Nay, not because it is negative. Rather, I think I have a new favorite in OKC, but I don't want the lines to grow even longer on weekends (as if my measly review will make any difference haha). I've now been to Care Kacao twice, and both times, walked away with a full and happy belly.The first time, a good friend and I met to catch up over brunch on a Friday. In comparison to weekend crowds, brunch on a Friday was empty! I snagged a table right away, and sat down to wait and peruse the menu. Everything looks delicious, so good luck choosing. I ordered the Pupusas and a Japanese Matcha Latte.O. M. G. I think I died and went to heaven. The pupusas? Perfection. Cheesy. Porky. Served with some sort of unknown sauce that I dumped on everything and it was AMAZING. They ask how you want your eggs, so I of course ordered them sunny side up. The yolk mixed with the pupusas and sauce? Done. I'll die happy now. The latte was perfection. Beautiful, as per my photos, and delicious too. Now this part. This is really where I don't want to share. They do dinner. And I don't think anyone knows about it, and I really don't want them to know. But, here we are. So dinner. I ordered the Hot Cocoa & Roasted Marshmallow with the Smothered Quesadilla. First off, the hot cocoa comes with a GIANT TOASTED MARSHMALLOW. Yes. The gentleman running the coffee bar was a gem, and was so sweet. When he heard me raving about my friend's drink (she received a little s'more with hers), he brought me a s'more too. THAT is customer service. And you can bet I've told everyone I know, and now I'm telling you. Go, order their drinks. Be amazed.The smothered quesadilla was absolutely delicious, and I found no faults. However, if I had to pick, the pupusas are where it's at. Service is excellent. The building is spotless. There is parking in their lot, and also across the street, and also on the street. So, even when there is a wait, you should be able to find a spot. But you won't find me waiting, because I'll be there at night, eating dessert with my coffee after stuffing my face with pupusas."}, {"review_id": "o_ibMtnz71kqIB4rU6M73w", "user_id": "6kSLgb1zoOU7Wgzb95n_Zg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Friends recommended us here and the restaurant was really good!
