This is a strong four star review that leaned into five but due to its location I couldn't click that far to the right...  Let me follow that up by saying aside from the location, the cool layout and tropical décor inside are excellent. The building sits near the main drag in town and competes with a few solid BBQ and Steak Houses. We dined in on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm. We asked for a spot at the main bar and was seated right away. I would guess the place was about half full with the lunch hour dying off so we could have gotten a seat in any section if we wanted. Along the whole bar top was large bamboo plants reaching up to nearly the ceiling with neat lighting. There was also a few big fish tanks with full of exotic breeds. We sat on large, comfortable seats and had our order taken quickly. The beer menu had the basics carrying handful of craft choices as well as some good looking specialty cocktails. Our food came out quickly and we dug in! We split a large order of chicken fried rice that was packed full of veggies and lots of fried egg, as well as two sushi rolls. Everything was fresh and delicious! Overall is was a great experience, fair prices with quick service and solid menu choices. Now every time we're passing through Cheyenne we will have to stop here! I recommend this as one of the better sushi bar & grills I've eaten at aside from the mini-mall location and limited parking. Check this place out if your in town and want a solid Japanese restaurant!"}, {"review_id": "GjrUwxrI_MIKd5bCOYmLQw", "user_id": "N5q04oMlANz0kgw1Fh1m8Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/25/2018", "text": "Glad we have this place in Cheyenne.

A vibrant crowd surrounds the bar and guests spilled out from the habachi section in the back. I sat in the dining area and enjoyed a miso soup as an appetizer. I was impressed with the amount of seaweed and happily surprised by the presence of enoki mushrooms. As an entree I enjoyed a spicy tuna roll and the fox roll with spicy mayo on the side. As a lover and frequent eater of sushi I must say that these two rolls were delightfully five stars. The spicy tuna roll had larger chucks of tuna than I have ever seen and was spiced to perfection. I highly recommend checking out Wasabi if you are ever in Cheyenne."}, {"review_id": "5ZLYQhMHP6Fj4etnFPQzGg", "user_id": "ECPhQHbYQuE_VxSKTKjBDg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/18/2017", "text": "Wonderful!

This place was a blast, not to mention totally delicious. My sister in law said we have to eat here while staying in Cheyenne, and wow was she right!! We got a few different things, from chicken and steak hibachi to gyoza and miso, and I really enjoyed each of them. The main attraction here is both the food and the \"show.\" They treat you like guests at a performance, and really these chefs do perform! Lots of flames and tossing food around, it was fun.The flavors were really great, and the miso and gyoza were even borderline authentic. The rest was really tasty, whether or not you're looking for the \"real\" thing.When we're back in town we'll have to try it again. Oh, and the lunch special is a much better bang for your buck."}, {"review_id": "IRicTk7v_fXTxBoP4PqQUw", "user_id": "xSTSdqDcc0xqpOXIwEd0fA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/13/2017", "text": "The bamboo terrarium behind the bar was unique, and the people eating hibachi seemed to be loving it. Quarters seemed like they could get a bit tight in certain spots in the restaurant, though.Bartender was friendly and attentive. The host staff seemed like they needed a minute to figure out how to handle us.I ordered udon noodles with shrimp and my colleague ordered sushi. Considering we were in Wyoming, I was quite impressed with the quality of the cuisine. I tend not to think of Japanese food when I think of Wyoming, is all.The takeout menus were VERY hard to read. I recommend the management make a revision before ordering another batch. Green on black is tough on tired eyes.All things considered, the pricing was fair, the service was on par, and the turnover time on takeout was reasonable. But there was nothing spectacular about Wasabi, nothing that will make me want to say to a friend passing through, \"Make sure you stop there!\" Another visit might change my mind, but I'm not from the region. Three stars for giving me everything a restaurant is supposed to give me at a fair price in a reasonable time frame."}, {"review_id": "Hl6uL-NNn6soTGGIJvwqmQ", "user_id": "XxfjrHE_t4DcMsICx7sS7g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/14/2017", "text": "It seems Cheyenne is a tough market for sushi. One pops up but closes down soon after. So when I saw this place, my interest peaked and I had to stop by to investigate. There is a parking lot so that's easy. The restaurant itself is on the second floor of an office building. Kind of fun to walk past a few offices and boom....nicely decorated Japanese restaurant theme. The décor is fancy enough to bring a date but casual enough to stop in at lunch. They have a good selection of sushi from basic rolls to fancy and they have a separate section for baked rolls. I'm not a fan of cream cheese in my rolls so I'm glad this place had plenty of rolls to choose from without the stuff. The fish was also pretty fresh (not the freshest I've had but fresh enough to justify prices of the rolls) which was surprising considering the closest major airport is Denver.I'll definitely be back next time I need a sushi fix in Cheyenne and I really hope this place continues to thrive. They have a good thing going."}, {"review_id": "hGN5Y_0GOrFtA7IMYKfMrQ", "user_id": "KnyZw7dldftVsbyXATJGBw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/19/2017", "text": "I personally like this restaurant, a lot!

Cheyenne isn't exactly a town known for ethnic food, but Wasabi hits the spot if you are passing through and need a sushi fix.The owner of this restaurant is Chinese, and previously owned the Wasabi restaurant in Bozeman, MT. Nice guy. He was making my sushi and I chatted with him while I ate at the bar.I started with the gyoza appetizer, which was delicious. The rainbow roll was also very yummy. I had four pieces of nigiri as well, and it was all quite good. I'd say this is the best place to get sushi in Cheyenne.

Originally it was very rice heavy (and the rice had no flavor), but now, the meat to rice ratio has evened out and I've actually had some pretty good pieces of fish and rolls.  The waitstaff was originally atrocious, but has been steadily getting better and better.Over all, I'd recommend at least trying Wasabi out."}, {"review_id": "j4c76b6w5ORT6Wzvst7-Mw", "user_id": "S8VdvITt6JkVfWO4xXgfqQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/24/2017", "text": "So good!
