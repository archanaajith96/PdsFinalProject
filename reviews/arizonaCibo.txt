Went on a Saturday night and sat right away, great environment. Service was EXCELLENT!! The food was to die for. We had pizzas and the pasta of the day which was the rigatoni with vodka sauce and sausage. There was no complaints. To top it off we got the Nutella and banana crepe for the table and it was a success... will definitely come back and it's on my list for the best restaurants in town !!!!!!!'n"}, {"review_id": "aoeAyhwsbMu4Bzd3O8mSFg", "user_id": "pX8BY8NVbla6Uzg3QIOe-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/17/2018", "text": "This is our favorite spot when we come to town.  The Ostia salad we could eat twice a day with these amazing fried parsnip bits, the pesto salad is equally amazing, and the truffle pizza is incredible.  Wait staff is perfect. The outdoor ambiance is the most pleasant and it's great for conversation with your favorite date - it's romantic, private feeling, with lights in the trees in the garden, the best food, and always a really good musician.  We go almost every day that we are in town for business, we just can't get enough."}, {"review_id": "OCYjvedyVEsd86uu7E4RHQ", "user_id": "6ObFF8-uKnOAlXuSH4TlyQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "We dined here on an overnight stay before catching an early flight out of Phoenix. We used Yelp's No-Wait feature and we able to secure a table with a short 25 minute wait! This place is located in a residential neighborhood in the downtown area. You can miss it....as the patio is beautiful and generously lit up with twinkle lights. Plus, you'll likely hear the live music as well. The atmosphere is super lively and as I mentioned, the patio is THE place to be.  The inside was a little loud. While the patio had live jazzy type music indoors was loud Rock. Again, lively, just in a different way. The menu is Italian and a-ok. My family is Italian...as in from Italy, so we're a little picky. We ordered the burrata- the toast it was accompanied with was very good. We also shared the calamari, which for my taste was too thickly battered. I prefer a light batter.The dipping sauce was excellent though!  We also dined on the Arugula salad with pear, a meat and cheese pizza, the Tartufata pizza which is a white sauce with mushrooms and truffles. And for dessert, we ordered the Zeppole (donut balls) served with a nutella dipping sauce. Who doesn't LOVE a donut ball with nutella? Well....they would have been perfect if they didn't taste like fryer oil. Other than that...they would have been excellent.The service was friendly and attentive. Overall a sweet place."}, {"review_id": "roeNkB0jjsQwyKuSu4msjA", "user_id": "oGUrhMb_e2bPBKhdvqHIRQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Cibo is located just NW of downtown Phoenix in a beautiful house with old trees all around it.  I highly recommend any of the porch seating under the trees - shade in the summer and heaters in the winter so it should be comfortable whenever you go. We went on a Saturday night, it was an hour wait, but we grabbed beers at the bar and sat around the patio while we were updated via Yelp as to our place in line (a new feature for me!)We started with the fried calamari and the burrata (cheese, tomatoes, prosciutto, and balsamic on toast) apps - very fresh and tasty - and then had two pizzas, a margherita pizza with the biggest basil leaves I'd ever seen, and an apple/Gorgonzola/walnut/arugula pizza that we sweet and bitter and peppery and funky.

I definitely recommend coming here for dinner over brunch/lunch because they have a very limited menu for brunch/lunch(I'm talking only 2 or 3 pizza options as opposed to their 20 for dinner).Inside seating is very cute and romantic but noisy. Outside seating is amazing at night and the live music on weekends makes it the perfect date night spot.  Tonight, we ordered the Tartufata and Linguine Cacio e Pepe. My fiancé and I always order the tartufata because we love mushroom, anything truffle, and prosciutto. The pizza here is just amazing and even though the white pizza doesn't have sauce (we didn't know this even though we've eaten here like 5 times) it's still the most tasty pizza out there.  Maybe one day we will branch out to other pizzas but the tartufata is our guilty addiction and I don't think I'll ever be able to give it up.Tonight was also our first time trying the pasta. The linguini cacio e pepe was a very mild but pleasant dish. It's mixed with butter, cheese, and pepper and while the flavor doesn't knock you out, it's still very good. Next time we'll try the bolognese.Cibo is the perfect date night spot. The outside view is amazing with all of the twinkling lights and the live music makes everything more romantic."}, {"review_id": "wm37Y8kAhGvGwAEVhPISKQ", "user_id": "r_e2XTc9tCokqo0YA4Vg9A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/18/2018", "text": "Finally I get a chance to wrote this review. And it really is with a heavy heart that I have to present Cibo with three stars. But in my opinion completely justified. My girlfriend and I decided to go there this weekend and revisit our first date spot. We live in Gilbert and this is a bit out of the way but we decided why not. This is one of her favorite spots so we made the trek. First and foremost I really don't understand why they would not take reservations unless it's a party of 6. We waited 45 mins to be seated. Once inside we were seated at a tiny table that is within body odor smells of the person next to you. In other words you are very close to other tables.  We also had the unfortunate pleasure of being seated between a drunken whiny birthday celebration in front of ya and a cackling hyena behind us. If you can mentally visualize this you will realize that it creates a very loud atmosphere. I literally had to shout a few times across the table. Now onto the pizza, what everyone comes here for. First I want to say that the Caprese salad is one of the best I have ever had. Anyways, we ordered the Tartuffata and Procida. The tartuffata came out with the crust and the bottom being burned. The Procida had some asian pear slices on it which were very tasteless. Furthermore when I grabbed the slice it seems soggy and wet the toppings all fell off. I was left with a soggy pizza slice. Needless to say we left a little disappointed."}, {"review_id": "PavnNsbpKfL0aTw5cdLa3w", "user_id": "TCPLaprJm4FFei2DkW6K6g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/8/2018", "text": "Okay. I'm sure in 2005, Cibo was probably a ground-breaking culinary concept for Downtown Phoenix. But in 2018? Eh. Okay, I guess it still has its charms to a certain degree, especially if you're new to the area.Although the ultra-trendy bungalow setup has now become somewhat of a hipster cliché in Central Phoenix, Cibo was there long before the downtown scene started picking up. Locals seem to flock here for their pizza and wine fixes. Based on the conversations I've overheard while eating, it's clear that Cibo not only serves as an ideal first-date place, but a somewhat secretive hideaway for middle-aged couples having mid-life marital affairs (I've witnessed both first-hand at nearby tables).Unfortunately, if you strip the ambiance out of Cibo and just look at their food for what it is, I've found it to just be only slightly above average. Their pizza is your standard-fare wood-fired style that can range from \"good\" to \"just okay\" depending on the day. On the positive, I do like that Cibo has no problem with letting you order half-half pies. Most places will arrogantly scoff at the mere mention of the idea. In fact, they even let you combine a white pizza with a red one, which is very rare, but incredibly convenient given all of their different choices.While I give Cibo credit for offering some interesting creations, is it really necessary to have 22 different pizzas (sans the calzones) on the menu? Oddly enough, despite all of these ridiculous options that give me anxiety at first glance, their best pizza is a traditional margherita. Their calzone, which is rather alarming at first due to its massive size, is also fine, but nothing that can't easily be obtained elsewhere.I've found a lot of inconsistencies with Cibo's pasta to the point where I'll only order it if I'm up for taking a risk. After my girlfriend and I recently ordered a taglietelle that ended up being undercooked, I was reminded of why I can't bring myself to give Cibo anymore than three stars.For desserts, their crepes are one of the few things that I feel they've got down to a science. You really can't go wrong with a Nutella-banana crepe with a scoop of ice cream thrown in.Their canned sodas seem like kind of an odd choice, especially considering most pizzerias opt for the glass bottle selection. It seems rather ghetto in comparison to everything else on the menu. Not everyone drinks wine, you know? I feel that Cibo is worth an occasional visit, especially if you're new to the city and not really familiar with the Phoenix restaurant scene. But in present-day, us dining veterans have become so spoiled with quality pizzerias and pasta joints that I feel Cibo is just kind of running on auto-pilot."}, {"review_id": "J5Ef-4MKZebJI5ocIbVzKw", "user_id": "8RnCxLbxeZHIslUfWvt7EQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "This is our most favorite sit down place to eat in phoenix!

The service was awful and the waitress Amanda was not friendly at all. Mind you there were 12 of us but it wasn't busy at all. There were several empty tables. We asked for split checks and with an attitude she said she would split them. We all ordered pizza at the same time. We ordered the margherita pizza and it was okay. I mean they really put a whole basil leaf on the pizza instead of shredding it or making it into smaller pieces on other slices. The crust is really thin and the cheese kept sliding off. They also don't have pepperoni which is odd for a pizza place.  Two people in our group still didn't receive their pizza as the majority of us were already done eating. They also got the same pizza and it came out 15 min later! The waitress never came out to check on us during our meal and took foreverrrr to bring our checks and bring our cards back after we paid. Also, our waters were empty during our meal and the lady who brought the last pizza out filled it since our server was no where to be found. Needless to say with the poor service and just okay pizza we will not be returning. I'd rather go to Fired Pie for the same type of pizza for cheaper."}, {"review_id": "FHgmJuTTop_WXI9GfGR42w", "user_id": "bR7j5ULN5oNEgITfnbbqNA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "This is a pretty neat place. Outdoor seating is plentiful, indoor seating is spacious yet cozy. I'm not really a person who eats Italian food a lot honestly. I rarely ever go out to eat Italian and I took a lot of courage and convincing from my friend to go here. The pizza was actually really good, the crust was crunchy, thin and chewy in some parts. Have to say that I enjoyed that the most. The meatballs in my opinion weren't my style, I'm not really the one to complain about portion size but the meatballs were a little too big. But still good.

Cabo is located in a former dutch colonial residence on W Fillmore near The Vig.  It's a fun and inviting setup that can be both romantic and classy in a bohemian sort of way.  Got it?We arrived around five-thirty and Cibo was busy, but not crowded. I would certainly recommend the Yelp App to determine what the wait time is if you arrive after seven. When we left two hours later, there was a dozen waiting to be seated. We started off with some Italian Red wine, Rosso Poggione ($13) and a House Salad ($5). Both were tasty and complemented each other. For our Entrées, we chose the Fra Diablo pizza ($14), with a few dollops of ricotta (for two extra dollars) and the Pappardelle ($15) pasta with a Bolognese sauce. Both were clearly different, but outstanding.  The pizza had a nice kick, but wasn't a fire breather and didn't overwhelm your taste buds. My favorite was the pasta. The Bolognese was meaty and had nice layer of flavor. See photos. Our tab, ran us a reasonable $61 before gratuities and taxes. Our server Cubana was friendly and on top of things, even though she was simultaneously handling a table of sixteen. Nice. After seventeen hundred Yelp Reviews, you can see and read why everyone loves Cibo. We do, too.

Hidden in the alleyways of Downtown Phoenix, nestled on the corner of a residential street, it can be easy to miss. But I am so glad I was invited to a friend's birthday dinner to celebrate here and uncovered the charming spot. The place is actually huge, with beautiful string lights decorating a romantic outdoor patio and an interior that mimics your favorite cozy Italian joint, there is plentiful seating to enjoy the wonderful ambiance. The wait staff that served out table of 12-15 was so kind and extremely helpful. Our food was ready quickly and the pizzas I tasted were quite good. A little burnt dough on the bottom and very thin crust, but that wasn't enough to turn us off to the menu. Good portion sizes as well. They also brought my friend a crepe with an ice cream scoop on top as a free birthday treat. I'd love to come back here and sit outdoors, experience the live music, and try more of the menu.

End of story. Not really, but it's just that simple. Their gluten-free pizza is by far the best pizza I have ever had.I've been so many times and yet, I'm always too enamored with the food to remember to take pictures. Most recently, my mom, grandma and I ate an early dinner prior to a show, around 2:30 on a Saturday. It was not busy and we were able to get our order in quickly.I always start with the pesto salad, it's so fresh. It's big though, enough for 3-4 people to easily share. We also ordered the Marinara and Procida pizzas to share. The Procida was amazing, my new favorite (bumping the La Noca to second place). The Procida is mozzarella, prosciutto, pear, arugula and goat cheese. To. Die. For.The Marinara wasn't my favorite but only because it wasn't one I would normally order. I don't like capers or anchovies, they both are too salty for me. The other two at my table loved it though!The price is great too, considering the quality, taste, and atmosphere.

Has been asked several times for beverages.  Also disappears before we can order.  I had to have another server come take our order. Very sad that each time I come the service has been underwhelming. Previous review below.  I went  to see a local musician named Tommy Connell last Sunday. The patio was lovely. Dimly lit with white lights and large trees. Thankfully we could still use the heaters as it was also cold out from the rain earlier that day. Tommy played a variety of classics and some originals on his Gretsch guitar. What an incredible sound and way to wind down after an intense weekend. He is a musical wizard as his fingers make their way across the strings. During his break he came over and chatted with my group. What a class act, a very humble man. A friend of mine mentioned later that he also won best jazz guitar for the Phoenix New Times. That is a award he certainly deserves. As per the restaurant itself. The food was delicious with large portions. The service started out very disorganised and quite unprofessional until about an hour in another girl took over and things ran smoothly.  I will be back though to see Tommy play again and will being a new group of friends each time. He is worth it!"}, {"review_id": "tUudpk3vVbO6hNsPhJxMdg", "user_id": "SGobMWMf7xwbOYHL6WMXyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "What do you want me to update.... my rating is still 5 stars +++ and love love this place.
