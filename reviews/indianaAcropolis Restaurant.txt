I always get my appetite started with flaming saganaki with peta. \"OOM'PAAA!\"The dolmades are in a red sauce - much preferred to that of the white sauce, common to the dish in other Greek restaurants.  The grape leaves provide the perfect crunch when bitten into. The steak - I prefer mine cooked medium - is the most tender meat and best cuts! (My mouth is watering just thinking about it).While they offer a bevy of sides, the ones you want with either of these dishes are the roasted potatoes and green beans. The salads are amazing and so is the honey-soaked baklava. The owner, Doros, is an awesome dude and does so much within the community - a class act 100 percent! Evansville is lucky to have business owners like him in the community."}, {"review_id": "kuij2AEaWr1MrekCvP-ZQw", "user_id": "7eG5YVTdNbMf6W34K7Zb4g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/20/2018", "text": "I was really impressed with Acropolis! The restaurant really goes for the Greek \"theme\" and it works - it's authentic and a little cheesy, but not silly. The Big Fat Greek Dinner is a fantastic deal - 2 appetizers, salads, 2 entrees, 2 sides, and a baklava for $30. It was a TON of food and way more than we would have ordered if they hadn't had the deal, but allowed us to try a lot of the menu items! We ordered stuffed mushrooms and fried calamari for the apps, gorgonzola pasta (no meat) and gyros for the mains, and tabbouleh and spices potato wedges for the sides. The waiter brought out one of the wrong apps, but was quick to switch it out for the mushrooms (since, as a vegetarian, I couldn't eat the dolmadas he brought by mistake). The gorgonzola pasta was creamy, although a little heavy on the sundried tomatoes - but I'm not huge on sundried tomatoes to begin with. My partner reported that the calamari and the gyros were fabulous. The salad was truly one of the best salads I've eaten - ultra fresh vegetables, a good balance between lettuce / other ingredients, and a really bright dressing. I was super happy with Acropolis, and I look forward to going back!"}, {"review_id": "IFTtxnQJOOInr7Li1_XRTw", "user_id": "Bu1XDNAaQnLkqnb6zIkueQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "By far....the BEST Greek food that we have ever eaten.

Not going back.  This place used to be good. Our server was not good.  At all.  I had the gyro platter and roasted potatoes. The plate was mounded with pita and underneath was some meat that tasted like fast food Gyro meat and potatoes that had been cooking in the crock pot ALL DAY, I could not eat them. Husband had some kind of Stromboli type sandwich with green beans. The beans were unrecognizable- they too had sat in the crock pot all day. It took forever to get our check. We had to ask another server for it (the hostess got our drinks after sitting for eternity...server only took our order and gave us the food).

Statues and greenery great guests in the entry. We were seated quickly on an inside porch.  Each table receives a basket of pita bread which included fresh and toasted varieties and a whipped cinnamon butter. The menu offers traditional Greek favorites and a few American traditional options as well.  We took advantage of the lunch specials. We all ordered gyros which came with a salad and a side ($7). The salads were immense with fresh cucumber, tomato, lots of feta, onion and Greek herbs. I was struck by the freshness of this delicious traditional salad.  I also had a glass of house wine ($5.50) which turned out to be a lovely buttery Kendall Jackson Chardonnay.  Our entrees came out as we finished our salads. The plates were hot and the gyros wrapped in a red checkered paper. For sides we selected tabouli salad, Greek fried potatoes, Greek string beans and sautéed zucchini.  Each of the sides were fresh and flavorful. The tabouli salad had a fresh lemon flavor.  The potatoes were crispy. The Greek beans were slow cooked with garlic and tomatoes just like my Grandmother used to make.  The gyros could have used a tad more tzatziki sauce so we ordered additional sauce.  Our server, Nick, was as attentive and friendly. He kept our waters filled and brought everything we needed.  After we ate lunch we enjoyed watching the eclipse from their side patio and table. Wifi was available as well. The Greek half of me says that the Acropolis serves the best and freshest Greek food in Indiana. And is  reasonably priced to boot."}, {"review_id": "3sXlkYX3oAVip-FHg4UYoQ", "user_id": "D-SsZU-rjeKKOd0N-MwYhA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2018", "text": "Had carryout dinner at Acropolis twice so I can't judge the service for dining. The hostess seemed a little disinterested and never had everything in the bag as promised i.e. utensils or napkins and sides. My biggest complaint is that the food is a little pricey for what you get. I'm not sure if that's by design so that parties order family style. Had the lamb chops, red sauce, rice and potatoes both times, wasn't bad but wasn't call home about.

I would give this zero stars but I can't. The food is great..However I was there last weekend..finished my meal and watched a roach crawl out of the wall next to me...told the waitress..she grabbed a napkin and killed it and said sorry...gave me my check acted like it was no big deal... I talked to the manager told her I was grossed out by it all..she denied having roaches in the kitchen..if they are in the dining area they have to be bad. All I got was a sorry..i still had to pay for my food. Was so grossed out we threw away our carry out left overs...they didn't seem to care..she told me someone sprayed the day before..contacted health dept..place looks nice but I won't eat there again..apparently they don't care about customers..gross!!!!

Bekka?) was our server tonight. I intend to have a discussion with the owners about her astoundingly rude service.She did not pre-bus our table. She brought the check to us before even offering dessert. When we asked for a dessert menu, she behaved as if we were an inconvenience. She didn't refill any of our beverages one single time. She didn't ask if we wanted more wine when our glasses were empty. She approached the table multiple times to collect the check while we were attempting to enjoy dessert. She never asked if our food was acceptable. She never asked if we wanted anything more. I get that people are going to have bad nights and slip up, but the sum of everything that happened made us feel very unwelcome.This was our one year wedding anniversary. I chose Acropolis because we have been treated well there in the past and enjoy the food. I question whether or not we will return. I feel belittled and insulted. The rest of our evening went swimmingly, or I would be angry to boot."}, {"review_id": "9_0PqXilyQMarNDTYcK8_A", "user_id": "y58xlbqNgIOYy2nzHcAb-w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/25/2017", "text": "Great food!
