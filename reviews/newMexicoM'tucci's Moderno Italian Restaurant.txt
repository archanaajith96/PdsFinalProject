We were so happy! Went in for a late lunch and had excellent service and delicious food and wine! It is far from where we live but we would go back in a heartbeat! Everything we ordered was so goI am amending my review and adding the fifth star.  Brought my father in this visit and he said the best clam chowder (he is from back east) and we ordered the Italian Twinkie, OMG! It was absolutely delicious! Enough to feed 3-4 people. Very friendly staff again."}, {"review_id": "GUNUCDQbv7FFUwXKkGRKVA", "user_id": "omYuq-EWw6v0K69HLUUcwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Yesterday we went here to celebrate our daughter's birthday. It was such a treat!We started with a house salad, which we shared and a Board B antipasti.  This is the only place I've been to where I can get a Whisky Negroni. Yummy. My wife had the Chicken Milanese Burrata. Our daughter had the Truffle & Goat Cheese pizza. I had the Cedar Plank Salmon. My wife and daughter had a Pinot Noir. I had a Whisky Negroni. (Personally, I don't like gin, so substituting whisky for the gin is more agreeable.) What's so amazing is that every bite is fantastic! Because it was our daughter's birthday the waitress offer our daughter a dessert. Our daughter chose the Tiramisu.M'Tucci's Moderno is a place you've GOT to try, if you've never been there before.

We started off with the fried Brie app. Came with bread apples n strawberries. Light drizzle of balsamic vinegar. Very tasty and just enough for 2. My wife had a chicken parm sandwich with fruit. The bread was toasted yet still chewy. Chicken was crunchy and there was plenty on it. The only drawback to the sandwich was the thick slice of tomato on it. Seemed either out of place or needed to be much thinner. I had the shrimp campaneela (I know I spelled it wrong) the pasta was perfect al dente and the sauce was better the amazing. 6 grilled shrimp on top and I was a happy camper. I am sure we will be back. I haven't had that good of a meal in a long time. Only reason for not 5 stars- charge for bread. Never seen that before. And the service was slow. We waited 5 minutes before the server even came by. Not busy at lunch at all. Would have been nice to be checked on after our first few bites but she didnt come by till we where half way done. But yes I will be back"}, {"review_id": "f62Mxcw1AOnYN2z8kAPO_Q", "user_id": "267f_IFzwrvgLi2OXXEt_Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Husband and I went here for our anniversary and we were so pleased! They have outdoor seating which is a big plus for me. Started off with the charcuterie board D absolutely delicious. I had the shrimp Campanella and the pasta was perfection. Everything is made in house including the pasta. Husband had a pasta dish with shrimp and mussels in a saffron cream sauce (I can't find the item online on their menu). Only took a star off because there was some grit in the mussels. Our server was excellent and she even took the price of our desert (Tiramisu) off for being our first visit at the restaurant. Overall a great experience and we will be back."}, {"review_id": "Bt3YaGZH-bqY0-aCLvdfuQ", "user_id": "og6DDC6bx3v4Us9sCvDuQw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/5/2018", "text": "It's amazing how different a place can look from the outside compared to what it looks like on the inside. (Same could be said for humans). You would never think that a restaurant located at a strip mall could be as nice as M'Tucci's is on the inside. This restaurant is actually really big, which was a delight because we did not have to wait for a table here. We were promptly seated and attended to frequently. The service here is almost uncomfortably fast, which I'm still trying to determine is a good or bad thing. Food was quickly delivered to our table after ordering which was great because we were starving. I don't know if this would be ideal if you came here for that whole \"1-2 hour dining experience\" though. The food here was really good. Like \"I'll be coming back here soon\" good, \"to gobble up all your other offerings\" good. I highly recommend this establishment to fans of good Italian food."}, {"review_id": "9M4svqEz6EvmwqO2NAorxg", "user_id": "l0YhTt-NdD9sJ_0VM94AeQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "I love M'tuccis at Montano and Coors. I'm not as crazy about this venue. The scenery out the front window is spectacular but inside it feels too much like a bar. There is a greater sense of separation at the Westside ABQ location.While I enjoyed my food, my husband was very disappointed in their version of the CHICKEN MILANESE BURRATA. And I have to agree. Instead of a side of spaghetti or angel Hair pasta it was matched up with a fettuccine with a pesto sauce. First, it wasn't appealing visually and second, we both thought it was not a good compliment to the wonderful crispy chicken, burrata and marinara. I had the cedar plank salmon, broccolini and instead of mashed potatoes, opted for their sweet potato purée. Mine was quite tasty! The staff was not as well trained, either. It's fairly new, so maybe with some time the staff will know the answers to menu questions more readily than our recent visit. Very nice, just need a bit more polish.Maybe I'll try again with a friend. Not sure my husband will go again."}, {"review_id": "kgciIYUGifPbmdT8iPQunw", "user_id": "EFxucMR_bcz4f5kZb3Favg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/4/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "We visited M'Tucci's Moderno again recently for brunch. It was again fantastic. My friend had already eaten lunch, so we shared a delicious brie appetizer. It was baked brie with crostini, Apple slices, strawberry slices and greens. I chose eggs Benedict, and the hollandaise was very good. I also tried the lemon meringue martini, and it was like a lemon drop with an added touch. Last, my friend had the \"italian twinkie\". He loved it, kept exclaiming how rich it was, and then proceeded to eat every bite and swipe the sauce from the plate. Seriously great brunch!"}, {"review_id": "WpaMFzG2L5aJnLnmO2-zEw", "user_id": "fKUcl6xEWHlJZm0HKQwQtw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/19/2017", "text": "Man oh man oh me oh my.....M'Tucci's is the shizzley wizzley bombdiggity bow chicka bow wow deluxe edition....I love this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There was a party room just off the side of the main restaurant where 45 of us dined on a Buffett style menu.  The food was absolutely delicious and the service was top notch. I didn't/couldn't give 5 stars because we waited over an hour for our main course, ran out and had to wait for more to be cooked, we preordered weeks in advance and had final numbers to them well before the night of the party. They were ill prepared for such a large crowd which was disappointing because the food that did come out was absolutely devine. This is a relatively new restaurant so I'm hoping they can improve upon their cook staff.

The arugula salad was also pretty damn good.  Love the goat cheese with their house balsamic vinaigrette - it works very well together and, I love the hearts of palm - such an often forgotten tasty twist to any salad!!Their spaghetti and meatballs, in my humble opinion is the best in town - it really is.  The spaghetti and meatball test for any Italian restaurant is like a great soup at any \"real\" deli.  If it sucks, then more than likely the deli meats and sandwiches will too.  If the soup rocks then so will the sandwiches.  I've never had a bad corn beef and pastrami after a good cup of matzo ball soup....Never.  Also worth noting...the Pappardelle Pasta with chicken and mushrooms - it's just another example of a creative kitchen that understands how to combine authentic flavors with appropriate textures.  It's a great dish, addictive and hard take home...cause if you're like me, you'll just keep shoving it down well paste the point where your brain is telling you to stop and your pants feel three sizes too small!  Aside from loving the food here, the service is always above and beyond. Being nice, polite and friendly is wonderful...unfortunately not a common practice in the food-service industry.  M'Tucci's however goes even beyond this in my observation.  They take pride in building relationships with their customers and this is what makes coming here in my opinion, memorable. :)."}, {"review_id": "_y-7lWiTUOytouRVcrY7dw", "user_id": "APx20b9etKLY0HDovgSrMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/29/2017", "text": "Moderno is the fourth jewel  in the crown of the M'Tucci's empire. The owners, Jeff Spiegel and Katie Gardner, know how to put together a crowd pleaser. Inventive food and exemplary service are the rule in their places. The Dazzler  and I were dazzled by the food served at a soft opening of M'Tucci's newest location in Rio Rancho last Wednesday. Excellent food, ambience, and service all around. This is destined to become my newest favorite.Moderno will have a full public opening on Friday, January 27. Go there. Here is a few words about some of the dishes on our first visit:--Charcuterie Board Sopressata Salami, Morbier Cheese, Homemade Rosemary Mustard, Olive Oil, Sea Salt, Market Bread--Spinach Fonduta Spinach, Garlic, Heart of Palm, Four Cheeses, Toasted--Pan Seared FishSeared Fresh Atlantic Salmon, Roasted Artichoke, Sautéed Arugula, Mashed Potatoes, Fried Capers, Lemon Butter Sauce, Smoked Prosciutto Powder.

If this dessert geets to the regular menu,it will earn a place near the top of my Hall of Fame Bread Pudding List.Three days after our first visit we returned and were treated to a house full of delighted patrons. This is without any advertising. Wore of a good thing spreads quickly.It is now my newest favorite, and the Bread Pudding will appear near the top of my Best Bread Pudding List. More dishes:--Calamari with Garlic Aioli. One of the two best calamari dishes I've had in ABQ. --Arugula SaladRoasted Red Peppers, Hearts of Palm, Goat Cheese, Arugula, Sweet Potato Hay, and a Balsamic Vinaigrette--Duroc Pork ChopHouse Cut 12oz Porterhouse, Artichoke-Parmesan Crust, Rosemary Mustard Butter Sauce, Grilled Garlic Polenta, Sautéed Baby Spinach.--Brioche Bread PuddingPort Wine Cherries, Chocolate Ganache, Rich Vanilla Gelato.
