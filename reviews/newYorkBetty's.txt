Chef Kujo Kumro is adding exciting vegan specials to the menu every week and turning Betty's into a destination restaurant for vegans while still appealing to it's traditional customers.There are not a lot of places where vegans, vegetarians, meat and potato types, and the less adventurous eaters can all come together. Betty's has all that, a kids menu, and gluten free fare.Tonight there were three vegan small plates, two vegan entrees, and a vegan soup. We ordered the seitan wings, the seitan beef on weck sliders, and the pastry bomb. Everything was delicious. The pastry bomb was filled with diced veggies, two kinds of lentils, and an extremely flavorful seitan. I love stuffed foods and especially savory pastry, so when I heard about this special I came running. I was not disappointed. We didn't get the tofucotta and bread or the jalapeno mac and cheeze, but they both looked great.There weren't vegan desserts, but that's OK. Everything was exceptional and I look forward to seeing future specials."}, {"review_id": "kuJgNOUaMTzJoSqCUw9Q5Q", "user_id": "hT0KceZbJMt1aFHFfNsDlQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I've long loved Betty's for healthy, fresh options and love it even more now that I'm 100% gluten free.  They make it easy for you to have a safe and comfortable meal without jumping through a lot of hoops. The menu is very easy to read and this was the first time I've been for dinner in a long time. (I almost always do breakfast of lunch.) The dinner menu is substantially smaller than the breakfast or lunch menu but still I had a number of options to choose from in addition to salads. I had the GF quesadeillas with pork and they were really, really good. As in, so good that you wouldn't have known that it was a GF tortilla if you didn't know.  It was four generous wedges (sorry no photos - I fell on these things like a bear after hybernation!) that were nicely crisped and fully loaded.  The GF tortilla was an extra charge ($2.50 maybe?) but that's pretty normal. Only one of the desserts they had this day was GF and it wasn't appealing to me, but I think the selection rotates with some frequency so maybe next time!"}, {"review_id": "iUNSYYXCuE1X63ZtZRnB8g", "user_id": "Y6L2JwGZ7VppV6s8ddtU8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/5/2018", "text": "I was invited to Betty's for lunch today and was excited to finally try this place.  It's a great spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch.  The menu had many options including Vegetarian and Gluten Free.  Normally I would have snapped more pics, but as I was out with family I didn't this time.  Trust me though, anything you order will be delicious!  The minute we walked in, the dining room had an aroma that made me even hungrier!  I ordered a simple grilled cheese and tuna panini, side of soup.  My aunt and uncle both had meals that filled the plate and their stomachs.  Betty's is a place I'll definitely come back to, although they lose a star for the inconvenient parking situation which put me a block away (though that's how it is in the city)."}, {"review_id": "aNKE74Wrdaj3QbSppbCNIQ", "user_id": "zDaTJ0wc3L_8LmogvICk4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "How wonderful to have a place with such great vegan options in Buffalo! Went with the family for the first time and we were all super happy. The service is awesome it's casual and laid back but our server was super attentive and kind and was always there when we needed her. I got the polenta cakes and squash (vegan) and it was excellent! The flavors were great. I felt the polenta cakes were a bit too thick and spongey. My dad also got the same dish and left a lot of his cake on the side as well. My husband got the rice and beans (vegan) I knew it would be a bit boring from the description but it had surprisingly a lot of flavor! I definitely think that the salsa needed to be more incorporated into the dish instead of just being a little side note on the edge of the place. It also needed additional texture and flavor than just being a bowl of rice and beans. I would have loved added crispy tortilla strips, avocado or guac, maybe some pepper slices, something to add dimension and contract to rice and beans. My mom got the pasta special (vegan). Wow. It was such a pleasure to be able to show my family that vegan cream sauces can be just as good as the dairy kind. The sauce was creamy and delicious. The dish was very spicy it tasted like stuffed banana peppers! Everyone was digging their fork into moms plate.My sister got the chicken pot pie and she didn't really like it. Maybe the vegan dishes are better than the non, not sure though. Not complaining about that at all. The Mediterranean hummus plate was ridiculous. I could eat ten of those. The pitas were warm and scrumptious. The eggplant dip was amazinggggg. I would order one plate for every two people. That's how amazing it is. We will be back for sure!!!"}, {"review_id": "zC-nChAw9fGg4RqAkOF2ZQ", "user_id": "ghJlR6RtTjyhRuPMzzETsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/5/2018", "text": "So I'm really far behind on my reviews (grad school and two kids under 5 will do that to you), but I can still remember the brunch experience I had at Betty's that was now months ago.My family and I went here after church one Sunday. And while there was a bit of a wait (this place is so good, cars were parking illegally -- likely opting for a ticket instead of missing out on their meals, lol), it was worth the wait.Betty's is a quaint spot on the corner of streets I don't remember that has that Greenwich Village vibe. (If you haven't been to NYC, you have to go to get the reference.)We opted for covered outdoor seating that allowed us to soak in the landscape and provide somewhat of a sound buffer in the event our then 3-1/2- and 2-year-old boys got loud.The brunch drinks (aka mimosas and Bellinis, because you have to at least one -- or both -- during brunch) were fresh and divine. Nothing felt processed or tasted like something I could buy in a store.I opted for a spinach omelet with feta cheese I believe. It was quite hearty but also light in bite if that makes sense. I couldn't pass up the sourdough bread and breakfast potatoes that accompanied it, because how else can you balance a healthy breakfast? (Duh.)My husband ordered a breakfast sandwich that had egg, bacon, and something else on it. While he asked for *no* cheese -- and it came with gooey cheddar -- he overlooked the oops because the food was really good.I forget what we ordered for our kids (there's no kid's menu), but we fed them, lol.Betty's is a cool spot that gets super busy and super packed fast. So long as you pack a snack during the wait, you should be just fine."}, {"review_id": "2nc_x_7ATGsaAdkNIg1agQ", "user_id": "-B69h4ujXXNcPbIenONazg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/17/2018", "text": "I had Betty's in my bucket list to go.

The food was regular price and it was amazing! Really delicious and the spot was perfect . One thing I really enjoy about was they have special for that day! I am not sure if they have it everyday but I love the idea that you can have regular menu also specifically that day you can try something new.They have a small patio that I think probably during summer they would have tables outside.I really enjoy my breakfast. They are really busy but good thing they have lots of spot. The waiters was not that much friendly but the food was so delicious, their decoration was so lovely that I still go with 5 stars. Their coffee is also amazing. It is different .

I also didn't get a refill on my water until we were getting ready to leave and those cups are really small that it should've been filled up many times.

Had lunch on a Friday holiday, and brunch on a Saturday, and now I am pretty sure it's one of my favorite lunch spots in Buffalo. And before I get into the dining, lemme just say I LIVE for Allentown in Autumn! There's just something special about those painted ladies and red brick houses (some of them the oldest buildings in Buffalo) framed by red and yellow leaves. I love the history and beauty of this neighborhood. What a time to be alive! OK... to the good stuff:Arrived during the lunch rush on a Friday. Party of two seated promptly. The dining area is bright with an artsy aesthetic. The clientele was as diverse as it gets. Our server, Deb, had the perfect combo of friendliness and snark, and I was here for it. For our cocktails, we decided on the St. Germain Kir Royale, which I would describe as a (generous) blackberry mimosa, or Heaven in a glass. Just gorgeous and perfect for an autumn afternoon. I doubt I will ever order another drink there because I'm hooked, but there is a full bar and a ton of choices from beer, to classic and specialty cocktails.I enjoyed the shrimp and grits. Betty's grits are served firm and cut into a square with cheese mixed in, kind of like Polenta. They are savory. The shrimp were char-grilled. They were seasoned simply and cooked to perfection. There were several breads from which to choose for toast. I kept it simple with Italian. My kind of meal, which I will enjoy again for sure. My friend enjoyed \"The Jazzy,\" a nice turkey/avocado sandwich on French bread. The salad was beautiful and fresh. It's possible the wasabi aioli was accidentally omitted, but she wasn't mad. If I order this in the future I'll ask for it on the side just to make sure I get it. Not deducting points. Returned the following afternoon for Saturday brunch. Slightly different menu which was great. When we walked in to the very crowded bar, the hostess made eye contact within seconds and took our name. She told us the wait was 20 minutes and sure enough, it was 20 minutes! Buffalo, you KNOW that's appreciated! We had a nice time at the bar, chatting with the bartenders and our neighbors. Very jovial atmosphere to set the tone which made my beau happy (and me happy for recommending the place). I always try the Benedict for my first brunch, so I ordered the Smoked Salmon. The Hollandaise sauce was [chef's kiss], and the salmon was fresh and succulent. My only notes would be my meal was served a bit luke warm, and the English muffins were a touch soggy and could have used a bit more toasting. Not a huge deal, but next time I think I will get the  chilaquiles! A generous portion with delicious savory salsa verde, it looks heavy but actually is quite light! Honestly, I think there is something for everyone at Betty's and my mouth is watering just looking back over the menu. With all the new places popping up all over town, it's nice to have somewhere \"tried and true.\" Speaking of brunch, the \"Make Your Own Mimosas\" option cracked us up. Fun for a group!I ended with a slice of Key Lime Pie. The whipped cream was REAL and the citrus to custard ratio was perfection. This was no slouchy diner pie. Whether you are on a date or catching up with friends and family, Betty's is a great choice. Parties of more than 2 would probably need to leave more time during the lunch or brunch rush, but it is worth the wait.TL;dr: Betty's has such a great reputation for good reason. There's something for everyone and the vibe is really nice. This is the best of Buffalo. I cannot wait to go back."}, {"review_id": "k7lmsInD0VY4bZyCFpPeHQ", "user_id": "2-RXaCcnNNIjFWPICdbfMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "I finally was able to give this breakfast gem a try with some friends after working a night shift. I think the only negative quality is the parking situation, which isn't surprising given that it's pretty much right in the middle of Allentown surrounded by homes, but you're fine as long as you pay attention to the city parking signs. OKAY now on to the restaurant itself. The dining room itself is not that large but there are a decent number of tables and you are not cramped. We had a very nice waitress who was attentive and made sure everything was going well. The menu seems fairly small but I'm sure they can customize some meals for you - I did not notice any omelettes in the menu. They have a morning booze menu, so I had to try their bloody mary - it was the perfect mix of flavor and spice! The drink included celery and an olive to make it classy haha.I was looking forward to ordering an omelette, but I ended up eating their breakfast burrito instead after noticing it in the menu. The dish was served with a side of hash browns, which were delicious, and most of the dishes have some fruits on the side. I loved the burrito, which I ordered with bacon (you can choose between ham, sausage, bacon I believe). It was served hot and did not fall apart.  I think the next time I return I'll either try their bagel with lox (I'm a native long islander after all) or I'll ask if they I'm able to order an omelette. I now understand why this place gets BUSY on the weekends!"}, {"review_id": "qGu2FjT4gSU1Pd_ufN_Hgg", "user_id": "_sROrsYZVUBsOpXzxqKBUA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "Wonderful food, great service at very reasonable prices!  LOVE this place.  Very healthy specials and so much to choose from.  A real gem!"}, {"review_id": "RsjMOPJSmCs3z8xRE9AlRg", "user_id": "Xv8y_zfjJ4bNnXbNpAMccQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "Hands down best breakfast in the area.

SERVICEWe made a point to go early (8:45 AM) -- No wait at all! That's not really a service feature but it made us happy! It was however, busy, and I think they were a bit understaffed at the time. But our server Lola was great, informative and high energy (and wearing bunny ears!) DRINKSSis - chocolate milk. Large glass, good, classic.Me - hot cocoa. I asked Lola if it was homemade and unique and she straight up told me \"no it's basically Swiss Miss\". I appreciated her honesty but I ordered it anyway, it was fine.MAIN DISHES1) WAFFLES: We asked Lola how big/small the waffles were and she shaped her hands and showed it to be like an Eggo freezer waffle size. So we ordered a double order. 8 of those sized waffles ended up being in the dish (I guess a single is 4). So keep that in mind when orderingWe ordered with just butter and syrup but Lola brought us whipped cream b/c she said it's just better that way and she was right, soo good! Another thing to keep in mind, the waffles are not piping hot. But they were delicious. And they had a variety of fruits in the plate that helped balance the heaviness of our other main dish.2) CLASSIC BREAKFAST: 2 poached eggs. I did not like these - there was a vinegar-y taste that I wasn't expectingsausage - these were delish. Two fat links so perfect for my sis and I to split.homefries - good, though not memorablerye toast - good flavor but very dry. Would have been nice to dip into our small bowl of poached eggs if I was feelin the eggs.3) CHEESE GRITS: THESE WERE AWESOME! My favorite part of the meal. Great balance of cheese and grits in the little squares, and well seasoned.OVERALL: Enjoyed my first jaunt to Betty's after living in Buffalo for over 2 years. Definitely will go back and try some of their other unique options."}, {"review_id": "JnyYQ5JuqkA1KiYfq_h1Qg", "user_id": "TGN8DRE4m4BkWhKAmK2o5Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/1/2017", "text": "HANDS DOWN THE BEST breakfast I HAVE EVER HAD! My friends came to visit me from NYC and wanted brunch and Betty's poped up on my yelp search. It had great reviews so I said why not. Got there it was a Lil busy because of the brunch crowd, but we got seated in less than 15minutes. We did request for a table outside but opt to go inside because we had a few pesky bee's that wouldn't leave us alone.We ordered coffee (it was OK) and mimosas, the mimosas was nasty, tasted like cheap champagne and orange juice, didn't care for it. I ordered biscuit and sussage crazy that comes with a side of home fries. My friend got the pancakes and omlette. We did wait a long time for our food to arrive but it was worth the wait. My biscuit and gravy was to DIE for, it was just amazing and the best part of the whole dish was the home fries. Oh man, was it good.

Sung by the lead singer of Switchfoot, just him and his guitar, you really get the feeling listening to the song that you're on a train headed somewhere else. When I come to Betty's I feel the same way. Getting here early on a weekend morning as there's usually a line waiting for them to open. I try to come with one person and they have these two-person window seats on the left as you walk in. Like any good diner, someone gets your coffee order and gives you time to look over the menu.I thought of Jon Foreman's song because I feel like I took a trip down south in some ways coming here. There is a southern diner feel but the place is nice (not divey at all). I'm always trying to choose between getting biscuits & gravy and their scrambled tofu hash with cornbread on top. I'm not vegetarian but the latter dish is insanely good with some hot sauce on top and everything mixed up together. This place is very special in Buffalo BECAUSE they serve southern breakfast dishes and do amazing things with them. They even have shrimp and grits! What?!Okay, so the only reason I docked them a star is because there's something that feels a little up-scaley about the place - as Maria B. mentioned it's a little pricey for a diner - but also there's the vegan, vegetarian thing going on and I feel like with that just naturally comes some type of pretentious vibe. I'm probably being a little too dramatic. And trust me, I don't let that stop me from coming. I LOVE the place and always feel cozy here in the morning.Don't let that last paragraph discourage you from coming - I just wanted to make you aware as a reviewer. My aim in my review is actually to encourage you to go! Also, I came here once for lunch and had one of the best salads out that I've ever had anywhere. To be perfectly honest, just thinking about their biscuits and gravy right now is making me smile.
