This is my type of bakery.We tried a few items including the Cocoa Puffs (chilled and full of chocolate filling), Poi Mochi donut (interesting texture and not overly  sweet) and some other flaky item that my husband picked out (don't know what it was but it was excellent).    I will make it a point to head here on our next trip."}, {"review_id": "odDs036062vpgFDpz0YvCQ", "user_id": "5SME8h3ZnMpQEOxFAxl0Aw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Grab a number if it's busy! Came in several times just for their mochi poi donuts (best eaten fresh!), but decided to eat in their diner as well. Limited seating on the counter but there was a secret ish inside the bakery seating area! You could smell all the baked goods goodness. Tried the basic burger (soooo good for basic, the bun was soft and light!) and pork chop (tender and good, but felt heavy). I didn't take a picture of the burger since it didn't look much but SO GOOD. The butter rolls that come with nearly every meal(not the burger though) is buttery heaven. Also available in bakery case, but make sure to bake and toast it at home to get the melted butter goodness!Restrooms are outside the restaurant. Head out the door to the left. Ask for the code!There is parking in the front and never had a problem with not finding any."}, {"review_id": "kfyFT1pyIcUuJ5AoAFnqDg", "user_id": "3MU-6CBPRp7pqY6PlIyJrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "Only going to review the Bakery side of Liliha Bakery but let me just say: Get their Matcha Cream Puffs and their \"Coco Puffs\".  You'll thank me later. The Matcha cream puffs are very unique and although they are a little on the sweet side, they are soooo good! I love the matcha flavor and it doesn't leave that weird matcha aftertaste in your mouth either!  Definitely    a must try and a great item to bring to a potluck in the case that you don't have any time to make something. The \"Coco Puffs\" are also equally just as amazing with Chantilly frosting on the top which makes it all the more unique and delectable.  I sometimes feel guilty eating so much at a time but the Chantilly is so creamy delicious and not too sweet (yup you heard me, the cream inside isn't like jaw hurting sweet so rejoice!) So you're bound to want to (possibly) eat another. Pro Tip: If you're fighting with your girlfriend/boyfriend, need to make things up to a friend, have a special event, love your parents a lot or you're just as nice person, then buy (at least) these two items for them. The receiving end will definitely love you for it (unless they are on a diet, then they might hate you for tempting them)Great local bakery!  Definitely come here maybe too often for the sake of my waistband but that's okay!"}, {"review_id": "C_iVSSacP0Ipkv81_lO6yg", "user_id": "lokN0g3uh37tgNyQ2I7qJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "5 stars for the food: I added two over-easy eggs to my corned beef hash sandwich.

A 4.We ate inside the kitchen where they have three tables: 2, 4 and 6 people. Very cool to watch the bakers at work. 5 stars.Waitress had to be prompted for drink refills, but otherwise nice and professional. A 4.Bakery and regular seating packed with locals.

And I even had the note saying, try the Coco Puffs.  The place is famous for Coco Puffs.  Everyone knows when you come here, you get Coco Puffs.OK, so did I get Coco Puffs?  Hell no.What the exact hell came over me?  In truth, I choked. Despite all my preparation, I got distracted.  And I got exactly zero Coco Puffs.  One simply does not go to Liliha Bakery and come home without enjoying some Coco Puff.  But I did.  Epic Fail.OK, so what was so amazing that I forgot to get the Coco Puffs?  The Pineapple Upside Down Cake.  That cake was love at first sight.  I mean, it was one of those things where you lock eyes on a dessert and everything else in the bakery starts to melt away.  Time stands still.  It's just you and the pastry. There's no need for words.  You know you were meant to be together.  You are consumed by anticipation of that perfect moment after dinner when you will become one with the object of your desire.Somehow, deep as I was in my pastry fantasy, I heard them call my number.  I felt hot. There were butterflies in my stomach.  All I knew was I needed to get that cake in a box and get outta there so we could be alone.  I stepped up to the counter and tried to play it cool.  I said, \"Oh, hi, yeah, I'd like one of those bear claws, a couple of those haupia malasadas and, uh, give me one of those Pineapple Upside Down Cakes.\" \"Anything else?\" asked the smiling auntie behind the counter. In a stroke of freaking genius I said, \"Yeah, make it two Pineapple Upside Down Cakes.\"  Score!You know how sometimes bakery cakes look better than they taste?  Not this cake.  If anything, it was even better than it looked.  Lots of times Pineapple Upside Down Cake can be overly-sweet.  Not this cake.  Most of the time you only need one piece of cake.  Not this cake.  I was so happy I bought two!After a romantic dinner in Haleiwa, my wife and I took one of the cakes down to the beach and enjoyed it while watching the sunset.  It was every bit as magical as I imagined back at the bakery.The Pineapple Upside Down Cake stole my heart, but I have to tell you about the haupia malasadas.  They were outstanding!  And they're somewhat of an engineering marvel.  I have no idea how they can possibly get that much filling into a malasada.  And the filling is unbelievably good, not the weird artificial-tasting stuff you get in some mainland donut shop.  The pastry part of the malasada is only a thin shell. There's so much filling!  Check out my video.  Is that maximum aloha or what?Mikey C says: I'm coming back for you, Coco Puff."}, {"review_id": "am6Z3OObNHK0C105PUfqaQ", "user_id": "zYPvMZS4XwEL0AH-MuSfow", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/30/2018", "text": "Awesome Cocoa Puffs!  I also like their cornbread and blueberry muffins.  Take a number, wait for it to be called, then place your order.

You can definitely tell that it's a mochi-donut hybrid, but it identifies more closely to mochi, taste- and texture-wise. They're super cute, too. Little balls of mochi-donut assembled to form a donut shape, and each bite reveals a bright purple interior.The donuts are lightly glazed, giving it a subtle sweetness. They're much lighter than typical donuts, and I easily/accidentally ate three of them in one sitting.Come here earlier in the day. When we went in the afternoon, they were unfortunately sold out of a lot of their other items that we had wanted to try. Also, I'm not docking any stars for this, but feel the need to point out that the service here sucked. The employee who was helping us had such a sour face and attitude.

I used to live so close and driving here would be easy but now that i live further, we have to make the drive out just for the chantilly cake.I mean, i personally don't mind going to a Zippys. Any Zippys that is and grabbing a Chantilly Cake there. But if i really want to treat myself out, I'll come here.Liliha Bakery is located right night to the fire station. It has a very big parking lot, which can and usually does get filled up fast at certain times.Is it worth the hype? I'd say yes. I've dined in and loved it. Service was amazing and spot on.The Bakery ugh so amazing. So much to choose from and everything is freshly made right there. If you buy a cake, you can get free writing on top of it, done right there. If you have to use the restroom, You'll have to go outside.One thing i will say is, I didnt like the Ensemadas.

The two must get items is the Coco Puff and the poi donut! I'll start with the coco puff. This was my most favorite item from the whole bakery. The choux pastry has a delicious creamy chocolate cream filling and on top is the COCO BUTTER! Ive never been to a bakery that has anything with coco butter. (Btw coco butter is different than the taste of chocolate in case some ppl don't know)The poi donut was good and my mother who is one of the pickiest eater I know said she just wanted to try a bite of mine and ended up getting another one for herself. I wish they had more flavors but they have perfected what they have. It was still chewy like mochi and had the taste of a good ole fried donut. I also tried the guava roll but it was too sweet and not to my liking.
