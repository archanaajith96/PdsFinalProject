I'm lucky enough to get to work from coffee shops throughout the week, and EAM is one of my favorites. The vibe encourages creativity and productivity. And let's not forget the blueberry/lemon scone that they almost always keep on hand. This coffee shop would easily get 5 stars from me if only there was a bit more seating.

In general, chai lattes tend to run the risk of being too heavy on the spices while being too watery for my taste.

At first, I was slightly skeptical as the cashier was not very friendly. I'm 100% sure that I told her that I wanted my coffee and pastry for there, yet she gave me a disposable cup and bag for my pastry to go. The barista, however, was very friendly as she handed me my cappuccino. Space is a little tight, but I managed to sit at a table for two and get some major studying accomplished. The cappuccino was very delicious. The pastry was so fresh! It was enough to make me want to return for more. Lots of different people entered on this particular day. There may have been a Small Business Saturday special, but I was too engrossed in my GRE practice test.

I finally checked out the coffee shop three weeks ago after my appointment. The barista who rang up my order was very friendly and courteous, and my selections were ready quickly. I ordered an iced chai tea latte and couldn't resist a chocolate filled croissant as well. The croissant was delectable with delicate, fluffy, buttery layers and filled with a rich dark chocolate ganache. (I am not sure where they get these bakery treats from but I really want to know...) However, I was disappointed in my iced chai. It looked and tasted like it was about 80% cream with a splash of tea.I would give Espresso A Mano another try in the future but won't be ordering the chai tea again."}, {"review_id": "HfECPRkpkep1pPmf5d9BhA", "user_id": "2O_6Wku6xFCGoPTl8TjMWw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/15/2016", "text": "Coffee. Atmosphere. Location. Employees. All are excellent in making Espresso A Mano one of my favorite coffee shops to visit. I will go out of my way to get to this shop. It has a thick urban vibe that inspires creativity fueled by its namesake. I have this habit of ranking a coffee shop based on its mocha (Yeah, I know . . . Pour over really is the way to measure. I get it.). This shop's mocha is delicious and distinct. A blind taste test would have me identifying this shop's mocha every time, and it's that kind of distinct mark that speaks to the greater uniqueness, which is Espresso A Mano. Why four stars and not five? Because people will sit and hunker down to work for hours. I don't have a problem with this and actually love this about this shop and most coffee shops, in general! 5 stars if you find yourself lucky enough to get a table. But 4 stars in actuality because it really is a coin flip walking in - and if you DID go out of your way to sit at Espresso A Mano and couldn't get a table . . . That just sucks. But we can't have our cake and eat it too. It's a small shop with a small shop feel and we don't want this to change. So, it's worth the coin flip to sit in this trendy, exposed-brick-looking-out-to-city-life-while-working-next-to-Banksy-(probably)-shop. It's one of my favs. Their drinks are great. You can pick up some Chemex filters if you've run out. You can buy a great croissant to pair with your coffee . . . Espresso A Mano is a total winner."}, {"review_id": "9vY4jPoOMp71VIBESXbBtA", "user_id": "B_RwA5qAUVSHJxEHA33QRA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "Nice urban-feel coffee shop In Lawrenceville.
