The inside of the building is very quaint and looks like an old bakery. As soon as you walk in the aroma of freshly baked bread smacks you in the face. When it comes to the menu it is slightly limited if you are looking for something other than toast or bread, but why would you come to a bakery if you weren't looking for bread? As far as bread goes they have a wide selection from dessert kind of breads to savory like a ciabatta with egg salad. The prices are a bit higher than you would expect for a slice of toast and coffee but it's still worth it. You can also buy an entire loaf of their freshly baked bread as well! I would highly recommend checking this place out because they are a solid option for anyone who enjoys breakfast!"}, {"review_id": "Lhthsg355L3zhSS75ZDtWw", "user_id": "6rBMqOthNkKNbJlOJs6hEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/3/2018", "text": "Locally owned bakery and coffee shop that prides itself in sourcing their ingredients locally. Its a cute little place with delicious baked goods. Their bread is amazing! Ive had the pleasure of trying their sourdough and the whole wheat bread. My fav thing they make is the apple coffee cake. It is not too sweet with delicous nuggets of baked apples on top and a crumbly textured cake on the bottom. Perfect with a cup of their coffee. They have other small things on their menu as well. Most accompnied by toasts. Featured in one of my pics is a special thay comes with egg salad, wheat toasts and roasted peppers. It was quite good. I love this coffee shop as it is usually quiet and a perfect spot to read and eat something delicious."}, {"review_id": "Tv3KjyChSlg0vHoAK3rwcw", "user_id": "WDNo8ijTRREGGftekLWBBQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/11/2018", "text": "I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! Well, I've fallen off my Yelp game in recent months, but STILL.My boyfriend and I live dangerously close and have eaten here a number of times. The toast options are amazing... I never thought $7 toast would be worth it, but I like surprises! One of our favorite offerings, the name of which I can't remember, involves pickled peppers and farmer's cheese. In fact, we ended up going back for it several times before buying all the ingredients to make it at home ourselves. This was a very good or very bad choice depending on how shameful you think it is to eat a whole loaf of bread in three days. And yes, they have many of the ingredients for sale to make their masterful creations at home! Another hit is the dessert-like cinnamon sugar toast with frosting to drizzle. I love that they give you cute little pots/containers of ingredients for you to assemble yourself. And the outdoor patio area is wonderful in warmer months, at least until the bees arrive towards fall. Yes, I am very glad to have such a wonderful bakery in my neighborhood and I'm sure it will continue to be a staple in our too-lazy-to-make-breakfast weekend rotation."}, {"review_id": "cU1B7zDsxbQ7T4wbgTqb7Q", "user_id": "OWAJHLaGTLJ0FSzenCrPwQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/15/2018", "text": "One of my most favorite spots in Buffalo!

We came here super early due to the red-eye flight and we were their first customer of the day. The staff turned on the background music and it was very soothing. In addition to their breakfast menu, they also sell honey, granola, Sarabeth's orange apricot marmalade, organic sugar, etc. There are only five main categories on their menu - toasts, breads, pastries, drinks, and sides.***Brown Sugar Tea ($2): This was the drink that really caught my attention when I read the menu. The drink might be slightly too sweet for some folks, but it had a REALLY strong brown sugar aroma.Whole Grain Cinnamon roll ($3.25) - I could really taste the whole grain with this cold cinnamon roll. Comparing with Knaus Berry Farm's life changing cinnamon roll (Homestead, FL), Five Points' version tasted just a-okay.Power Bread Toast (bread made from flax, pumpkin, and sunflower seeds sweetened with a golden raisin puree + goat cheese + orange apricot marmalade, $6.75): Super cute decoration and unique silverware! Goat cheese was really good and peach apricot also tasted excellent too, but breads tasted slightly burnt.***It is a good breakfast stop, but just know that you might still feel hungry after the meal!P.S. - One free refill if you order a cup of coffee."}, {"review_id": "gy3E4LBTfZVuZz3jVyI_bA", "user_id": "dFTGIlrwse-OlnDCdI568g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "If you've watched and enjoyed any of the mini food videos this bakery is for you.

They avoid the cliche with a lack of avocado toast and instead offer choices like apple cider with triple creme Brie or their Vollkornbrot that comes with saurkraut and raclette cheese.

I checked the reviews on yelp and saw a couple of 5 stars from Elite members. So the expectations were high. We decided to pass by on a Saturday morning. Five Points an old brick building with a nice garden area around - you really could make something out of this place - they are probably half way there. Service was very friendly. We ordered an iced coffee. My wife took the apple cake - was really good. I had the sauerkraut, raclette toast. Was very surprised when I got it - some toast (was good bread) with some sauerkraut beside and a little piece of - not melted - raclette cheese. Ok - that's it??? Sauerkraut was good. Place is ok for a morning snack - nothing spectacular - good place for hipsters. I have to add - I got a nice response from Kevin shortly after my review with Â some good explanation. Will certainly check it out again"}, {"review_id": "tI0NJKYP_eHhuYdIUtv6Gg", "user_id": "VaDdQ-KTB4VfFEnHCLD2Cg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/3/2017", "text": "This bakery was one of the best I've been to. I was visiting Buffalo before going to photograph a family and decided to head here for breakfast beforehand. The exterior and interior were both beautiful and felt very rustic. I had an iced coffee, cinnamon roll, and some whole wheat toast. The coffee was good-they even used frozen coffee to keep it cold and ensure it wasn't diluted by melting ice cubes which was great! The cinnamon bun was to die for! I even purchased a bag of frozen ones to take home for the family to enjoy. The toast was also perfect-they give you 4 fluffy, golden brown slices to enjoy. The strawberry jam that it came with was also amazing! Thanks to this bakery, I have now been craving toast with strawberry jam for 3 days....something I thought I'd never say!"}, {"review_id": "7hU7d9UjGFqRCRVxbWe3lw", "user_id": "Ot326UTJsRkP-GkXuvkiMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/15/2017", "text": "Five Points bakery is one of a kind.

It was my first time eating here and I brought my sister out for her birthday to celebrate. The servers were making food with their bare hands, no gloves on. Handling food gloveless as well. My child was scared with the dim lighting, he is 1 years old, and because he was crying the waitress asked if she could seat us outside! It was cold and I told her that I would not leave because I was a paying customer. She kept trying to insist that we go outside because she had to look out for the other customers. There was a total of ONE highchair in the entire establishment. The play area that was designated for children, had a bunch of toys that were very dirty and hadn't seen a wash cloth in months! The food was pretty good, but I couldn't sit and enjoy it because I was so bothered by the waitresses comments. If you have kids, this is NOT the place for you. I'm not sure why they were acting like they were running some top notch establishment when this place is located in the lower west side, middle of the hood. If you don't want specific people dining in your place of business then choose a different neighborhood.

I don't make it as often anymore, but I do love it there. Â So, Five Points is a laid-back community-oriented bakery with a focus on sustainability. Â (For example, they offer a discount to anyone who walks or rides a bike to get there.)They have a great variety of breads and a number of \"toast specials\" that people can get for breakfast. Â Perhaps the best thing on the menu might be the cinnamon rolls. Â They are delicious - with a little more texture to the dough than might be typical and a creamy frosting - without being too sweet. Â You can eat them there, get them to go, or get frozen ones to heat up at home (which I do for Xmas morning). Â A few other favorites are the Power Bread, the Apple Cinnamon Bread and the Sourdough Bread. Â They have breakfast specials - e.g., Power Bread toast with chevre cheese and a specialty jam or Sourdough toast with nutella or Apple Cinnamon toast with peanut butter and a cut apple. The only other thing I will say is that Five Points, while wonderful, is not for everybody because they don't have everything. Â I've seen / heard people come in and be disappointed that they can't get a breakfast sandwich or meat products. Â (They do have hard boiled eggs in addition to the peanut butter and cheese options for protein sources)."}, {"review_id": "9LE3yOxI0Jvtvw8jL4zWjw", "user_id": "k0qip8EKFasSFDc5U13ZIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/11/2017", "text": "Amazing.

Â I'd pass by and look at it with longing, try to get information about it online, rack my brain for an excuse to stop in, and fantasize about taking it out on a date....that didn't quite happen, but I did go on a date with a human male here, and my little crush has become love.This place fits perfectly into the New Buffalo Aesthetic without crossing the line into being intimidatingly hip. Â The building is well suited to the leafy, quiet street it's on and doesn't seem to be disrupting the neighborhood flow. Â Every staff member I interacted with was cheerful and polite, and the warm wood interior, mismatched flatware, and borderline erotic scent of fresh bread made me wish this were my living room. Â I got here around 9:30 AM on a Sunday expecting to beat the rush, but the interior dining room was already packed and the patio filled up before I left. Â Not that I can blame anyone - if I lived any closer, I'd be here all the time. Â It's everything you could ask of a local cafe.Now on to the actual food! Â Discovering the existence of the apple cider toast is the thing that finally got me to make the 20 minute drive down here, and it didn't disappoint. Â Think apple pie in bread form, then add triple cream brie. Â My compliments to the establishment for serving the cheese at room temperature, when it's at its most spreadable and flavorful. Â I also tried the brown sugar tea, which I can't wait to come back and get on a cold day. Â My dining companion is a bit of a rye bread aficionado and spoke very highly of his marble rye toast with charcuterie. Â On our way out, we picked up a bag of various bread heels (75 cents!) and got to try a few of the other breads, which were all super dense and flavorful. Â This is one of those places where the quality of the ingredients speaks for itself. Â I don't think a person could ever run out of things to order here.

We visited on a Saturday afternoon during a day trip to Buffalo, and picked up one of their famed whole wheat cinnamon buns to try. It was soft, chewy, and light. It definitely tasted healthier than your run-of-the-mill usual cinnamon bun. They even gave us extra frosting on top that made it extra delicious. We would definitely get this again. As well, they have a variety of products on sale (various breads, honey, etc) - some breads were even sugar free.We'll definitely back to try out more of their pastries when we're in the area again.
