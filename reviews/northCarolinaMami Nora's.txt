Her neighborhood organized a meal train- someone brings her a dinner for two every day during recovery. Pretty moving and kind gesture. But I'm a good snob and can only handle store bought rotisserie chicken so much. By day 3, my yelp search for dinner was starting at 5 miles.... I needed some time out of the house. Stashed away amongst the plethora of gastro pubs and Mexican places, I found this joint. There's basically one thing on the menu, chicken. You get some chicken, some more chicken, or a whole chicken. That's your menu.  So obviously I had to give it a shot if they're gonna base their business on 1 dish. Got the 1-2 chix, rice and beans and a salad. Really I have no idea why I chose  the salad... I just stare at  it, and eventually move it into the plastic bag to throw away so I can drown the plate with sauces.4 star reasoning:3*- ease of ordering. I used the yelp app, and it cancelled my order because they \"couldn't get through.\" I called the place, and they said 10 minutes, after a 30 minute wait and drive.4*- the chicken. I messed up doing Togo. The styrofoam created that sweat lodge and basically dampened, and cooled, the chicken and more importantly.... the chicken skin. The rice and beans were pretty tasty, and not overkill on the portion. 5*- the sauces here are the draw. The green has this really great texture, and the flavor is a mike Tyson to your tongue. First it's amazing, then you cough from spice, then you adapt to the right portion of it. If you get the chance, dine in"}, {"review_id": "xWWPTOC1ZZFaOceD71Irvg", "user_id": "7N7vPv-36TxwtD3e7D6WXg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/29/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Sorry Mami Nora's, your food is awesome but your service has gotten progressively worse each time I visit.

Also there will be employees standing around not doing much while there is one person taking orders with a long line of people.

We love Peruvian chicken places, and this order-at-the-counter restaurant is now at the top of our list. We both ordered 1/4 white with two sides each, one with black beans and yuca fries, and the other with yuca fries and plantains. Our orders came out quickly, even on a busy day. Delicious! The chicken was smoky, perfectly-cooked and well-spiced, and the sides were just as good as we expected. Pay attention to the menu at the counter; some sides are included in the price of the meal, while others cost an additional 50 cents each. We were there on a busy post-holiday Friday afternoon, so it took some time to find a seat.

The wait time around lunch was way too long. Took at least 20 minutes to order and get served. The chicken was very good, I really like Peruvian rotisserie. The choices of side items are poor and should be expanded. I got rice and salad. How to you screw up rice? in this case by letting it sit around and dry out, and over salting it. How do you screw up a side salad? In this case by using stale precut lettuce that was all brown on the outside edges, and just not fresh.

I've passed by Mami Nora's so many times and figured it was not my type of food but I have heard so many good things from other people I decided to try it. My husband and I both got the quarter white chicken. For my sides I got the Tostones (fried green plantains) and cole slaw. My husband got the fried sweet plantains and french fries. I tried his sweet plantains and they were the best side. I didn't care for the Tostones or the cole slaw. They were OK but I'm picky so I blame myself there. The chicken was so good. It's very juicy and tender and they do such a great job of spicing it. The sauces are great and can be combined as well. The yellow sauce I could tell was sort of mayo based. That was my favorite. The green sauce is delicious and definitely pepper and cilantro based, but damn it's spicy! It hits you after you first taste it. Parking is plentiful, service is pretty good, the inside is clean. The portions are huge and the prices are cheap.

This is the closest I can get to home cooked food whenever I don't have time or don't feel like cooking.  The food is tasty!  Service is just alright.  There's nothing special about the service.  I remember driving passed Mami Nora's at least once a week for a long time. I just thought it was another southern fast food or barbecue place. That's just the vibe I got. A friend ate there, and posted a picture of her food. I saw rice, beans and plantains and was sold! They serve Peruvian style charcoal chickens.  They are very tasty and flavorful.  I have used them once to cater a family event, and everyone loved it.  I still eat there whenever I'm in the area.  Now, as a vegetarian, I get the veggie plate- 3 sides. They also offer daily specials.  I have never tried their dessert, but they have them.  Pay them a visit if you haven't.

Mami Nora's is five minutes from our house and we drive by it every time we head downtown. Every single time we drive by my husband and I look at each other and say we need to try that place out. Finally this past Friday it was time, we headed on it Mami Nora's. You order at the counter then wait for your name to be called. I went with the quarter dark and my husband got the Pollo Saltado. For sides I went with the side salad and fries. Dinner for two for under $20? Sign me up! The place was pretty packed on a Friday night and it was a bit of a battle to find a table. Once the food came the chicken was amazing, I'm not a huge chicken person and this was freaking good! I will say the quarter dark was a bit on the smaller side, more of a lunch portion, for dinner I'd go with the half next time. The salad is just basically lettuce with a tomato thrown in, but I still liked it. They have a house made cilantro vinaigrette. The fries were hot and tasty. I tried out my husband's dish and it was delicious as well. The food was so good we went back in on Sunday for lunch and we never go to the same place twice in one week! This time I went with the chicken soup as my side and it was more like frozen vegetables in broth. My soup lacked chicken and had way too many veggies, I would not suggest that as a side. I'll just slowly work my way through all their sides to find my favorite.
