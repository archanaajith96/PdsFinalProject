Kong and his crew are insanely knowledgeable about their craft and make for wonderful company. They also love to offer order suggestions and they have never steered us astray. The food is consistently beautiful and delicious.The omakase offering is our favorite. Omakase means that you let the chef decide what he/she will serve you. Kong knocks this out of the park. We highly recommend this place."}, {"review_id": "1sRcRsvEtEIkGADTuAiKjg", "user_id": "nF7Vcgv-l23bPcCcKCy-Zg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/12/2018", "text": "I don't come here often but when I do, I love it! They have very good sushi, fast and I've gotten great service every time! My favorite is the sexiest man roll, it melts in your mouth So Good!!! The hangover is pretty decent too, the pork is overlooked and a little too rough in my opinion but overall not a bad ramen in this area."}, {"review_id": "ydLpJ8fKgAZnlIHuLxNIlg", "user_id": "HX02LFgHMPhURVxADIWvyw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/8/2018", "text": "Umami is quite easily the number one choice if you want Japanese cuisine in Baton Rouge. The seafood is always fresh and I mean always. The food presentation is picture perfect and I appreciate that to the upmost. Umami is great for date nights, happy hour, group gatherings, and just about everything!For drinks the Japanese mule is a must. The apple vodka they use in it is so delish and tasted crisp and refreshing. On this visit I tried the Sake toro (salmon belly) and it changed my life! It exceeded my expectations by how fresh it was and the vinaigrette paired oh so wonderfully with it. I am still thinking about the dish as I write this review. They also have limited quantities specials menu, which I highly recommend to check out before it's no longer offered. I ordered the scallop robata from that menu and it was a little bit too much sauce but the mushrooms' texture coupled very well with the scallops. The snowcrab ramen was very satisfying as well, especially with this cold weather. I do have to say that it was a little bit spicy with the strands of pepper on top.Finally the birthday dessert they offered was a fried cheesecake with caramel, chocolate, and/or strawberry sauce. To be honest I had low expectations because I don't like fried anything and I don't like cheesecake. Surprisingly I actually ended up liking it when I tried it! All in all I just love coming here! The experience at Umami makes me feel so fulfilled!"}, {"review_id": "uGFV0I8cyrFYbSyOaoQvEw", "user_id": "T5Rt0B7BGXLADk-Vd_GPJg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/6/2018", "text": "Pretty pricey but worth it!

Foie gras ($16) - this was the biggest waste of foie gras ever! Not money. They put so much sauce on it that you couldn't even taste the foie gras. It was so disappointing. Literally tastes like maple syrup. I have never not liked a piece of foie gras and the worst part was that they used such big pieces. So. Sad. Grilled bone marrow ($14) - holy crap so good. They put these strips of something on it that you usually see on takoyaki. The ones that move by themselves. Lol. And it's served with like extra buttered toast or something? I dk. But this had so much flavor. Skip out on the foie gras and get this!!!Hokkaido uni ($24) - wowowow. I live for uni. But this made me so sad. It was so fishy. I know it comes from the ocean, but it was like bad uni? Idk. And I was too ashamed to tell the chef. My fault. Maybe I just got a few faulty pieces. Yesterday I spent a total of $85 (w/o tip) on these three dishes. I have never been so unsatisfied leaving Umami. I won't/can't knock off a star because I know that everything else is still so good here. I just won't be as adventurous although literally bone marrow, uni, and foie gras are my fav things to eat in LIFE."}, {"review_id": "u4B4HwBUhT4XJyPec1Tgbg", "user_id": "QeKgvlfzq8xHKBcK0IwmPA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "This is my favorite sushi place in town.

My boyfriend and I came here for a nice sushi date. We were awkwardly the best dressed people there thinking it would be a bit fancier, yet the ambiance was still nice and we looked darn good. The sushi was all clearly labeled with gluten free indicators, which is extremely helpful for sensitive stomachs like mine. We had the Sexiest Woman Alive, the Tiger Roll, and then two gluten free house rolls.  The Sexiest Woman Alive was our favorite. While it wasn't gluten free because of the eel sauce, the combination of tuna, mango, and crab meat was unlike anything I had ever had. It melted in your mouth and was very filling without being too heavy. My boyfriend had the Japanese Mule which was delicious and they have Tito's vodka at the bar for the gluten free drinkers. We will be sure to come here again, but will probably wear jeans next time."}, {"review_id": "0A4F4D9poYyk8xLVO8cIlQ", "user_id": "FNUrM2eckKiliuNuOnjSqw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2/21/2018", "text": "Yeah, not impressed!Not deserving of just 1 star, nothing was terrible.

We were cutting it close when we came in to catch the last half an hour of the happy hour. It was our first time there, I was starving, thinking we would only get half portions, so we just went ahead and ordered everything on the happy hour menu. It turned out, it was so much food. And everything was delicious! Oddly enough, my favorite were the fried Brussels sprouts. Definitely returning to try their ramen next time. Few days later, went back for the ramen. The flavor was definitely good. They ran out of the pork, and so it was substituted with chicken which was fine. The chicken was very dry though, and flavorless. What also annoyed me was that the broth was not piping hot, it was only warm. Other than that, it was a delicious bowl of ramen."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/umami-japanese-bistro-baton-rouge?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
