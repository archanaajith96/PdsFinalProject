The quality of the meat is so good that even the most simple, plain burger tastes like a gourmet treat. My go to is the cowboy burger. The combination of their great beef patty, crispy bacon and tangy bbq sauce is exactly what the taste buds need for a dank meal. The portion sizes are great too. I never leave hungry. This place is awesome."}, {"review_id": "6UX0KQ7rGchQ9fO2vmhwBg", "user_id": "ehX1d1aFb2qujZhUB3qoeA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "I was very excited to come to this establishment as I'm new to the area and looking for the best burger in Charlotte! I ordered a double cheeseburger (no additional toppings). Cost $12.50 (fries and drink not included)The place was packed, but only had to wait 10 minutes to get a table.. an additional 20 before we got our food.First impression: small small patties... almost as small as a $1 burger patty from a fast food establishment.Taste: Great! Not the best I've had, but very good!After I finished my burger.. my friend looks at me.. \"you still hungry too huh?\" Conclusion: Great tasting burger, but it was too expensive for what it was! The small patties left us still hungry! I don't see myself coming back to eat here again."}, {"review_id": "JYgYaVRZw2xSbMZx3NLxww", "user_id": "Pli7LcquUlzXGDnqIlZqYA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/19/2018", "text": "Pros:Quick Moderately pricedCons:I've had better burgers.

Just a regular burger place. Far from being the best burger in Charlotte. The customer service is also a problem. Employees who seem to be unhappy with their jobs and the restaurant does not like customers to spend time there. You are required to order before you can even seat. My wife sat down with our kids while I was ordering and one of the employees almost kicked her out of the table. Will not return."}, {"review_id": "8fsK1H27drZvvYJkf0WEpA", "user_id": "FhqgZHUjzV6x9uYNs05Q5A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/27/2018", "text": "Fun burger joint. It's been featured on the food networks show. So It gets very busy and small area inside for seating but it does open up quick. Daily specials on the board. Weds - 1/2 beer. I had the burger bowl, which was great! Loaded with lettuce, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, hard boiled egg, bacon and guacamole topped with a grass-fed burger! Very filing- was great! Cleaned my bowl!Hubby had a single Cowboy burger with a basket of fries- small for the price $10. Add an extra patty for $3 dollars.

They have lots of burgers, and you can get them made with a black bean patty or 100% grass-fed beef (with an upcharge). Grass-fed beef was my choice since that's what I use at home. I ordered the TNT Burger, and it was delicious. It was perfectly cooked. It was pretty spicy. It came with ghost pepper cheese, fried onion straws and sliced jalepenos. The siracha mayo came on the side, so you can control how much or little you want on your burger. The fries were great too...the perfect sidekick. I had the sweet potato fries and they came with a slightly sweet dipping sauce that I want every time I eat sweet potato fries. The service was friendly and the all employees seemed to get along well with each other too which is something I always try to take note of. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and my husband made note that he wants to return the next time we're in town to try the Seoul Burger because it looked and smelled so good when it went by."}, {"review_id": "sFPqsxh5u_3oYgqCpLtY1g", "user_id": "x9TwWWBUVOTIyDSNX99ukg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "Food was absolutely AMAZING!!!!

Sure, they've got it. You want a sunny side egg on top with onion straws and ham? Yep, they got that too. I'm more of a burger \"naturalist\" meaning that I appreciate something that's simple and a burger that's much more than just throwing 5 weird toppings on it; hold all of the extra shit, it's unnecessary. The fries are good, but nothing groundbreaking and it's nice that they have a few draft beers to choose from. This is a counter-order style restaurant, so it's fast and casual. In addition to being casual, it's extremely crowded on the inside with tables stacked on top of each other. It's also not the cheapest with each burger costing around $10 and doesn't include fries or a drink. Plan on dropping $15/person.   While it's a good burger spot, it fails to really stand out among other establishments such as American Burger Co. and Cowbell. A solid 3/5...You won't be disappointed, but you also won't be blown away."}, {"review_id": "WsHuinnl4Qczmtw8U63Btg", "user_id": "uyjAYgMgCNrvdEskV6fPMQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/19/2018", "text": "I was visiting ATL & in the hotel room I was watching the food network and this restaurant was featured on diners drive in & dives & I quickly got excited because I've been looking for hot spots here in Charlotte. I quickly wrote down the name and saved it in my notes. 2 months later I finally came to see what all the fuss was about & omg the fuss is real I got the Swiss mushroom burger with spicy mayo & home fries. I absolutely enjoyed the burger. It was so juicy!! Also the cheese platter boards are so cute, it adds the perfect touch.Service was quick - no long lines. Sunday around 8pm is the perfect time to go.

Another disappointment of a North Carolina establishment of food. Not excited about this, but one thing. The ranch. Alright, we literally planned this for weeks and a group of 10 of us showed up. Ok it's a smaller place and seating for the time we went wasn't an issue, but it definitely could have been, so I am thankful for that. I ordered the weekly special which was the chimichurri burger and it sounded good. I got this over the TNT burger based on the servers recommendation. We spent over $150 before we go any further.So I ordered EXTRA crispy fries. They came SOGGY. I asked for MEDIUM cooked, it was WELL. These are two critical errors in a burger joint. They ask me specifically of how I want my burger cooked and then it comes out wrong, then that's on them not me. When I asked for extra crispy fries then they are not even stiff they were soggy and lumpy. UGH. The flavor was fine on the special actually so a star for that.My friend next to me got the pimento cheese burger and added burger. It was good and add a star to this review.Here is why I didn't say anything. I didn't eat anything all day. I hate sending food back as a matter of purpose and waste. Purpose it should be done right the first time. Ok we are not perfect fine. And then I didn't want to literally waste a whole meal in the trash. And no one came to check on us to see how our food was so I couldn't even say anything anyways. The ranch was good. Another star for that. Honestly I will give them another try. I'm just annoyed my burger was over cooked and my fries were soggy and halfway cold. Well till next time."}, {"review_id": "iX1I4r00nia5m4bZB-JFEg", "user_id": "py4MyhThMBV4d4ZUK0AwoQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/6/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Took the family, only one of us had been previously. Everyone ordered the bang bang burger and fries with one order of sweet potato fries. Order was taken promptly and food came out pretty fast. Everyone loves their bang bang burger and the sauce. Sweet potato fries come with some kind of sweet dipping sauce that was really good. Place filled up quickly and we had people standing around waiting for tables to empty so they could sit down. Very good first visit and looking forward to returningUpdate 5/18:  came back and food was again very good. However, this time we waited an eternity for our food. My best guess is 25-30 minutes for 2 burgers and fries. Luckily I was with my lovely wife and we weren't in a hurry but these are burgers and fries it should never take 30 minutes. For that reason, dropping down a star"}, {"review_id": "LGmRX_a3BrBHcDgzbmzdwg", "user_id": "chZwdGspJz5_xmm9dQnBkQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "This restaurant definitely holds up to the hype it gets. The food was fantastic and I left stuffed and satisfied. The burger you order comes out as pretty as they advertise. The only downside to this place is that seating is difficult to find during their busy hours, and you kind of have to hover over people until someone leaves. Parking can be a little tough too during busy hours as well. The food is worth the wait though. If you're not in the mood to sit down take out is also an option.

Now, I can't wait to go back! With so many burger and fast food places nowadays it's hard to find a burger done right. Bang bang    Burgers though, they do it right! Upon walking in, we noticed the place was packed so we were a little worried we wouldn't have a place to sit but luckily as we got done ordering a table opened up. Even though they were busy, our food was out in 5-10 min. I ordered the single bang bang burger- medium with sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked well on the out side and perfectly medium/pink in the middle. If I was super hunger, I'd definitely try the double, but the single filled me up just fine. The sweet potatoes were crispy and had a great bite to them. They came with a white sauce which at first I thought was ranch but it was sweet and complimented the sweet potatoes so well. You know how sometimes you try a new place and you want to try something new every time you go there- well, this isn't the case, I've found my perfect burger and I want that every time I go there."}, {"review_id": "DWIn6YQHF1Y3FjkOKOmt2w", "user_id": "7POBkzuVgCrf4PpVcUxEaQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/6/2018", "text": "Ordered the cowboy burger.
