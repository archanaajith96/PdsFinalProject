For years i've always found myself inside of cups cramming for a test or catching up with friends over a Capitol Street Classic latte. It marks another spot where you will always run into someone you know. I have noticed ever since the new renovations there has been an increase of customers which is great for the business! But it has list a bit of the rustic old school grungy vibe it once had. Its like Seattle when it finally emerged from the 90s a decade plus after everyone else. You're relieved and even poke fun at the past but, don't you secretly miss it?"}, {"review_id": "q2VH99gdY8fXol580sOSDQ", "user_id": "AjWi5qoeY_PMZH2lcn0HHQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/29/2017", "text": "Great coffee place to see and be seen.  They might be giving Starbucks a run for their money in Jackson.  Loved the pound cake looking pastries.  I asked for soy in the medium chai latte and I am pretty sure they used whole milk instead.  My stomach is still rumbling.  Interesting place to go when you want a little more than just coffee."}, {"review_id": "v8wehcCdfqLvfmn4BTlonA", "user_id": "QSdqdb9r0j1-Bz7M7wqzkQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/16/2017", "text": "Quaint local coffee and tea house.

Jacksonian were so steeped in their excellence that Starbucks couldn't break into the market. On one occasion, a Starbucks closed because they couldn't handle the local competition, Cups took over their location. This is probably why you don't see protests like the 1999 WTO Seattle Protests in Jackson.They still have excellent coffee, no question about that. They keep up with all of the coffee shop trends, so of course you can get a pour-over, a hand-selected tea or one of their classic latte drinks. They also make their own K-Cups and have plenty of coffee released home goods and gifts. Really, a one stop shop for all things coffee.This sounds like a four star review, right? Great coffee, other things to buy and a repellant of violent black bloc rioters would probably warrant four stars generally.They recently did a redesign that has terrible feng shui. A dragon would have a hard time strolling through here. In fact, while he was ordering his coffee at the counter that is now directly at the door, his tail would stick out of the door. He would double back on himself to go get the coffee he ordered and then wind up tangled with everyone else as he searched through their three storefronts to find a seat. While ordering, he would have to squint to read the tiny writing describing the roasts of the day. It feels like they have lost their cozy charm. I guess that is keeping up with the trends, but the re-design does not seem to have been well thought out. Again, stop by for the coffee, but you might just want to get it to go."}, {"review_id": "aSkFOIb9KDSK_i4_cWxDlA", "user_id": "eMqXNO2hV4ebt1q96FQJpg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "You just need to try it!

Located in the Fondren area, it's a central hub for students and professionals of all backgrounds to grab a drink or pastry to enhance their day. The staff is very friendly and will go the extra mile to make sure customers have the best experience possible. While coffee is their main focus, Cups also serves as a gallery space for local artists to display and sale their works with the works changing every 2-3 months.

Whether I'm doing some work on my computer alone, or meeting up with friends, this cute little coffee shop is perfect for either. As of now, they are working on expanding the coffee shop so there will be a lot more room for seating, which can be a problem on a busy Friday afternoon or Sunday morning. They have lots of specialty drinks with cute names like Blondie or Brunette and  traditional espresso drinks. You won't find a *cough cough* \"corporate coffee caramel macchiato here (but I'm sure they'd make it for you if you asked!). Sometimes the Internet is funky but if the shop is pretty cleared out, you shouldn't have a problem. One of my favorite things on a hot day is the Granita. Not sure what exactly is in it but it's basically an espresso icee. Oh my gosh yum. It's probably my favorite on cold days too. They have a variety of baked goods and evens though they aren't made in-house, they are still delicious. Especially the cranberry biscotti! They also have granola and fruit parfaits but they're out of view. I would recommend Cups in Fondren to anyone in the area who wants to hangout and grab a coffee!"}, {"review_id": "k3tb-QtqKDCSl4TmNhfCuQ", "user_id": "dPLaY-t4BF7KZI9SXABg5A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/15/2013", "text": "This is one of those eclectic coffee shops with an adorable and trendy atmosphere.... I wish I could drink that instead of the coffee.As seems to be the main gripe with Cups (reading the other reviews and talking to friends) the espresso is definitely on the burnt side.  Getting the iced coffee was delightful though! And finding soy milk in Mississippi was nothing less than a miracle.  They also carried some interesting tea blends that were great to warm up my fingers in the chilly weather!Customer service was good but not great.  The second day when I bought a gift with my coffee, they rang in the wrong one and had to void and re-ring me up.  It was a ten-minute process involving three people.  I felt so bad that I almost just overpaid.  BUT since their coffee is not on the cheap side and I am not on the wealthy side, I waited it out, despite the frustrated looks of the salespeople and customers behind me.  Well, THAT was embarrassing!Honestly though, I LOVED this spot for gifts.  The mugs were super cute.  I bought one that said, \"Coffee, the nectar of gods\" for my friend and another travel mug for Justin U. with some great art on the outside.  One of my travel buddies bought an artsy shirt, really soft and organic cotton.One gripe though.... Cups, please ditch the Styrofoam cups!  Not cool for the environment... if you hadn't heard.  Plus you might upset your hipsters!The prices aren't cheap but Cups brings a unique vibe and cool work environment to Jackson!"}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cups-an-espresso-cafe-jackson?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
