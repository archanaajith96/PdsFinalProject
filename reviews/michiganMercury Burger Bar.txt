Outdoor patio during the warmer weather and fire pit in the winter. Quality burger patties starting at $9-13, fries not included. Like any good burger joint, their milkshakes/malts are equally up to par.If you're not into burgers, they also recc their popular Reuben and chicken sandwich. Open past midnight on weekends, so it's a popular drunk grub place at the right time.

Food is just as good, as it always has been every time I've dined here. I sat in the basement last time because we had a bigger group and I love how cozy and at home we felt! The decor really adds to the aesthetic and experience. Maybe my negative review was a poor day for the waitresses, but since then service has always been up to par -- if not better. Pros: - Grilled chicken sandwich is the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The chicken is never fatty or rough. The seasoning adds a lot of flavor. - Pickles .... who knew I'd be excited about pickles but here we are. They're delicious and so fresh!- Sweet Potato Fries taste amazing with sriracha sauce or by themselves. The large portion is more than enough for 2 people   - S'Mores milkshake is so unique. The toasted marshmallow adds so much flavor. For $1 more you can get the to go size which is enough for 2 people to share (or you can always treat yourself!)Cons:- Sometimes the hostess will cram too many tables together despite it being a slower night. It's a louder place and sometimes I wish I could hear my own conversation without hearing the table next to me too- Slightly pricey. For 2 sandwiches, large portion of sweet potato fries, one soda, and a milkshake the total is about $40 after tip"}, {"review_id": "mQXVuKdJgWsJTYhOvnvXbg", "user_id": "UWK3mKjnsVOA6sGim6zfgg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/27/2017", "text": "Great food.

The atmosphere was casual and the ambiance was a little retro-chic. The menu was creative, and we liked that they had vegetarian options, although bright of us bit on them. I chose the N.Y.N.Y. and my boyfriend chose Eastsider. Both were cooked to our preferred temperature and we absolutely LOVED the sweet potato fries. We were hoping to get an appetizer with our meal, but they only had side items as options including a handful of loaded French fry and tater tot options. All-in-all, it was nice to try something new, and with the growing food culture in Detroit, there is a lot of tough competition fighting for 5 star reviews. I would rate the Mercury Bar a 3.5, but since I can only use whole numbers, I'm in the habit of rounding down."}, {"review_id": "0Xj2U9bprVVwD_6-9vk08g", "user_id": "F1z_Z3QQv45n_1wcQYe-lg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "Very cool establishment in Corktown, Detroit. They immediately earned a star right off the bat for cooking the burger MED/MED RARE (the way I WANTED it...unlike BLACK ROCK..../end rant) Absolutely spot-on. I went with \"The Juicy,\" which had cheese melted in the middle. The title does not lie! It is very juicy, and a bit messy.My husband ordered the \"Flint\" burger, which had olives on it. In his words, \"it was perfect.\" Drawbacks: 1) Parking: You have to park directly on MI Ave (on the sides of the street). This is NOT the street I want to park my car. Steady traffic, crazy traffic, etc. Be EXTREMELY careful when getting out of the vehicle if you are on the driver's side. The inside was cute, but needed more room. It seemed very cramped; however, I should mention that during the warm weather, you have the option to sit outside (I would have, but it happened to be insanely windy that day). It was a \"tad\" pricey as well for a simple burger joint. They had a full bar, but they also offered Labatt non-alcoholic beer and non-alcoholic drinks.Service was prompt and friendly. We went during lunch time and it was super busy, so next time we will try going during non-peak hours."}, {"review_id": "fobzsudrsSTGb3Bvww1RyQ", "user_id": "vb29w8IhkK8FbeLfvU9Fdg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/7/2017", "text": "Unimpressive.

I almost don't have words to describe how amazing it was. Order it! I got the classic burger medium with extra pickles and chipotle sauce. It was very good but they cooked it well done. Surprise surprise, everywhere I go my burgers are over cooked. I also got chili cheese fries - delicious. That was the shareable portion. My husband got the venison burger. His was also cooked well done, not medium. He's unsure how he feels about it because he is not accustomed to eating venison, but he says it is not gamey. I took a bite and thought it was okay but I enjoyed the flavor of my beef burger much more. Anyways, they have a large menu that even includes hot dogs and other sandwiches. Enough items to satisfy any craving."}, {"review_id": "PsXOPRfttrHt1KBoTSipQA", "user_id": "b1LMbf-DkrqPDvCBZvAqBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "This is the best burger I've had in a long time.

I haven't had any of the beer here yet so I will have to get back to you on that, but I do enjoy the shakes. I think they make some of the best shakes in the city! I also enjoy that they utilize the basement for tables and space. It's not a large place but they make the most out of the space that they have. I have always had decent service here when I have gone so I have no complaints there. I usually take people here when a guest is visiting from out of town or I can get here for lunch during the workday. I think the location is great and they have done a great job with the bar.

I've passed it a million times but never ate here. I had mixed feelings at first because I was greeted in such a pleasant way upon entering the restaurant sat at the bar and asked the bartender to hold my seat as I went to the restroom. The restroom for the men is in the basement and can only occupy one person at a time. I waited 12 minutes to use the restroom while several men began to line up and others saw the line and went back to there tables. Little did we know the door was locked BUT no one was in there.  I was not happy with this ordeal. I go back to the bar ordered my food bacon cheeseburger (added mushrooms) onion rings and a beer at the bartenders recommendation all YUM!!!! Especially the Neapolitan Stout. WOW may I have another?  The onion rings were great burger was a perfect medium and super juicy. I also ordered a shake to go (they charge a $1 more) saying it's larger. I don't know how true nor how much larger because I had nothing to compare it to but it was PHENOMENAL!!! I had the strawberry one I loved it. If you're not into whipped cream I'd recommend you telling them to leave it off. They also put a cherry on top. If you order a shake and drink it in house they'll add liquor in it (called a grown up) for $3 more. Can't wait to try that one \"I'm grown\". I over heard the owner speaking with another patron about other restaurants he's been considering in various locations I HOPE AND PRAY THEY OPEN ONE IN MY Neighborhood (Grosse Pointe would love to be your new home)!!!"}, {"review_id": "smuBHy5zMXGnfiBECdzWSQ", "user_id": "uUURtEXV26DywodB6o13vQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "Great tots, atmosphere is a little cold.

Wait staff was very polite, always around when we needed them. I also thought the milkshakes were really good, I would get the extra shot of alcohol for sure. There was a lot about this place I did not like. The burgers were a huge let down, they were clearly pre made patties with the quality of Costco bulk buy burgers. The fries are pretty good but the poutine is pretty watery. The tater tot nachos are decent, but again the cheese is very watery and runny. The place isn't terrible but its way over priced for the quality of food you get. For 3 burgers, 2 fries, two appetizers, 3 adult milk shakes and a beer our bill was over 100.00!! I would say pass and go eat somewhere else, even applebees or chili's burgers are better, if they cut their prices in half I think it would be worth it."}, {"review_id": "GBIMXLt-mvpkcNrJq5MZWg", "user_id": "WKWl469Cmihx0H1qEZqGnA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/14/2018", "text": "Everything I could have hoped for in a Burger + Fries.  Simple and perfect,.  There were a few other items on the menu I would have ventured to but when in the D you gotta have a burger or two.  I'd say Detroit is the best burger town I know."}, {"review_id": "2SIerCHxtphM369yacb-ng", "user_id": "H3BFUuh4uNva-RFjogUVGQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/3/2017", "text": "What a burger. The Local had pulled pork, coleslaw, cheese, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes. I wish I had gone with friends so I could have tried more of their unique burgers. There was no way I could have eaten much more after it by myself.It's a good portion size, you shouldn't need much more after it. It could have probably used a tiny more pulled pork for balance, but not enough to dislike it. Both meats were very nice, juicy, and of course the slaw gave the crunch and the necessary vinegar base to cut through the meat.I'm hoping to go back soon to try more and experiment. Since I did carryout last time, maybe I can sit down, eat, and enjoy the cool atmosphere in corktown.
