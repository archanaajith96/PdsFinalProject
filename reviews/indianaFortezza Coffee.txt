Plenty of seating inside with a couple tables outside. They have a bar area to try their beers and there's always great new local art up on the walls. Drinks are comparably priced to Starbucks. And it's a very cool atmosphere with a mix of old and modern-styled furniture and beautifully carved ceilings."}, {"review_id": "8CddIuV5MEMGUI-LV3D7qA", "user_id": "4M-_VFd0HfckjrJTd0GDLw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/6/2018", "text": "We stopped one afternoon at Fortezza Coffee for cappuccino. This was our first visit.  The staff was polite and very helpful with suggestions, talking us into an apricot almond bar treat. The wait after ordering was short and we had our coffee and desert.  The cappuccino was perfect, complete with the foam heart on top.  A work of art.  The apricot almond bar was delicious.   Looking forward to future visits to Fortezza Coffee."}, {"review_id": "jESSmQWAKVcH0gHwFmM4Ig", "user_id": "n1u56LcVoLknON_vqKBALg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I love coming here!

I love the atmosphere of this adorable coffee house off Calhoun in the heart of downtown Fort Wayne. It's just a quick bike ride away from home, so convenience adds to my adoration! Once you walk in the door you feel welcomed by the friendly staff and the spacious lounge area. Stop in for a coffee to start the day or even for a sweet treat or post dinner tea. I also enjoy strolling here over my lunch break from work when I need some relaxation in the middle of the day. A few of my favorite items from the menu include the variety of teas, chai tea and latte specials throughout the year. They also have great options for brunch available in the morning through mid-afternoon. Grab your laptop, hop on the free wifi, sip on that tea. If you are looking for an adorable coffee spot, stop into Fortezza!"}, {"review_id": "06rpvYaV9-8w1ntSxq3p8A", "user_id": "P5Uvz1Ze39y0OQ7XZCgJ0Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/7/2017", "text": "I love coffee art! When I found out there was a coffee shop in town that could do it, I knew I needed to check it out. I have been a fan of Sean's coffee ever since his first location on Dupont Rd, Trionfale Expresso. That location no longer exist but I was happy he opened up this place.The atmosphere here is exactly what downtown Fort Wayne needs. It's modern and chic. The Baristas are super nice.I highly recommend trying one of their pasteries. I love their pasteries here. The macaroons are all extremely flavorful and isn't hard like others places. The cake rolls and cheesecakes are the best in town. I loved it so much that I have ordered it for a family member as their birthday cake. I am not sure if they do this all the time but if Sean is there you could ask him. It is on the pricey side but birthdays only come once a year so it's okay to splurge for that special someone. I would also suggest ordering it a week in advance. My go to coffee is the mocha latte. If I need a stronger kick for the day I would have the drink that is a shot of Expresso but half of the drink is hot and the other half is cold. I am not sure the proper name of this drink but you can describe it to the Barista and they should know what to do. It is extremely strong so be prepared for that caffeine to kick in."}, {"review_id": "rsZhn2XzZjwrc_eyILTZJQ", "user_id": "ku22MtUUexmvtzXKvJmt4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/7/2017", "text": "Made a short stop, liked what I saw, loved what I tasted! Great quality espresso beverages and delightful latte art. I had the espresso macchiato, which is just the espresso shots and a dollop of milk foam on top. (fyi I like strong coffee with not too much sugar). My friend doesn't drink coffee but enjoyed her green tea soy misto. Prices were quite affordable. Off to the side of the coffee bar is a cozy area to hang out or study, probably fitting max 20 people. It was already full during my visit on a weekend afternoon. There's also limited seating around the coffee bar. The employees greeted me and everyone else friendly. Food, snacks, and alcoholic beverages were available."}, {"review_id": "SIuoavluAmo8yAmOMiAXPg", "user_id": "g1LkJdSXJJba3X-NK6Dm4A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/27/2017", "text": "Love these types of places. Very hip! It has a nice space for a one or five group, high quality espresso, and strange foods. We had a muffin, breakfast sandwich (I didn't eat the side at all), and a couple cappuccinos and they were good with designs on top and everything. Definitely a fun spot for 5 minutes or 50 minutes."}, {"review_id": "LFyH-vTvJM2B3j67l2OHcg", "user_id": "MotGduLVj6-hMXKtvmBomw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2017", "text": "What a great little place!

It did not disappoint!The place is so spacious inside and has great character. It was a mixture of people studying and conversing. I chose to sit outside as their was a small open table and the weather was beautiful.I ordered a regular iced coffee and the quiche special (spinach and goat cheese). The coffee had such a great, strong flavor. I did not even need to add any sugar or cream! It was very refreshing. The spinach and goat cheese quiche was delicious! It was accompanied by a small house salad and granola parfait. Both were the perfect addition to this healthy breakfast.I definitely recommend Fortezza coffee for anyone visiting the Fort Wayne area!"}, {"review_id": "-RiIC1Ly3iFuw2SPZDDVog", "user_id": "DLy6786SYbUu4F35t4Y01w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2017", "text": "This is one of the best local coffee shops in Fort Wayne.

As a full-time college student, this is one of my top study spots.If you're in the Fort Wayne area, you definitely need to support them.

And! A spiffy logo (yes, this is always worth noting in my book). I had the pleasure of tipping back their pumpkin latte with a coconut milk substitute. Very delicious and the coconut milk added an extra dollop of flavor (and warmth?) to the cup. They also offer a free water dispenser for those who need some agua with the coffee. Last but not least, they also offer brunch items that look quite delicious (see Yelp photos)."}, {"review_id": "qwuEE3t0axVKuL2VEV0aRg", "user_id": "IiqlIucYjM3mfurb86SW2A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/31/2016", "text": "I'd give it a 3.5!

A great place to post up for the day and work on your laptop or hit up during your break at work for a latte. I recently enjoyed two of their seasonal fall drinks. The Pear and Allspice Cortada and the Salted Caramel Latte. Both were fantastic. I wish the pear flavor had came through more in the coffee but overall it did the trick and gave me a caffeine boost! Salted caramel latte was awesomely presented. It was served with a salted rim and a caramel cube on the side. Highly recommend. The baristas here are friendly and seem willing to mix up and concoction you want if they have the ingredients. I observed that know their regulars and their orders to a T. Well done! I have also enjoyed a brunch here with a friend a few weeks back. We stopped by on Labor Day weekend by accident and I am glad we did! I had the chorizo open faced breakfast sandwich served with sweet potato hash browns. WOW. This was an awesome breakfast. Great way to spend brunch and left me feeling better than eating something greasy. They have a back room which I believe can be rented out or reserved for meetings, parties, or what not. Lots of natural light and a few outdoor tables to enjoy your morning coffee with your pup!"}, {"review_id": "OJ9i0a04zp-Spa-mMpxRrg", "user_id": "5fyPo9FRj2pCL6_ZzIACRg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/15/2017", "text": "I've become a regular at this place - I find it great to study and to catch up with friends.

Let me tell you why:Every inch of Fortezza, every employee, every scone, coffee or (my favorite) dirty chai is abundant in quality, service and finely honed barista craftsmanship.These guys have taken the art of being a coffee shop and brought it to downtown Fort Wayne in a phenomenal way;The tables, chairs and group meeting room provide a great environment for studying, reading or light hearted conversation about whether my girlfriend is in fact secretly a Sith Lord bent on galactic domination.So what about the coffee?It's strong. Really strong. If I'm not drinking coffee I'm drinking chai. Better yet, dirty chai (chai with a double shot of espresso). I pair my delicious chai with a scone- and then get 3 scones to go because they are that incredible. While you're at it, grab their amazing macaroons which are also made fresh daily.If this hasn't convinced you to visit Fortezza yet then you are a lost cause but I do want to add that in the past 32.5 times I've been here I have never had bad or unfriendly service. Actually they must all be drinking the house coffee because they are curiously (suspiciously?) friendly. Keep it up Fortezza and I'm glad to see local establishments of this caliber here in our very own Fort Wayne.Regards,AbhiAKA Dirty Chai and 3 Scones Guy"}, {"review_id": "aVAM00asFXi5BB6hHoesLA", "user_id": "HEDSM82M9WgmpSF48llIrg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "5/18/2017", "text": "I have tried this coffee shop many times and it just never measures up.
