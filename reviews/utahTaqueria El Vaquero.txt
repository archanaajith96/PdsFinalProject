We were so excited to find another hole of the wall taco place that's authentic but not as well known so we could skip the line. Unfortunately they fell short of expectations. First off, the physical store is kind of an eye sore. Everything is old and dingy, screaming for an upgrade. It looks so old that it kind of looks dirty, which is not appetizing. When we came, half the lights were off which made it seem like they were closed when they weren't. Overall just not a nice place to hang out too long. The people who took our orders were friendly and helpful. But they messed up our order a couple of times, albeit not a big deal in comparison to the rest of the experience. Since we heard such nice things about their authentic tacos, the boyfriend decided to go all out and order one of each off the menu- asada, al pastor, pollo, carnitas, lengua, and cabeza. The salsa bar was not lacking in toppings and variety- they had the usual works. But nothing looked fresh. They definitely sat out all day and have not been refreshed, changed out, or touched at all. I hate to say it but the tacos were nearly inedible. We each had 6 tacos to ourselves and I probably ate 3 total, if that. The meat was cold, so so so dry, and pretty bland even with the toppings. I hoped that maybe some meats would be better than others but all of them were equally subpar. I'm hoping that maybe we came on an off day. Perhaps that we came on a slow traffic day so they had their meats sitting out too long and didn't bother making more. Had I the ability, I would give them 2.5 stars for friendly service but below average food."}, {"review_id": "OfBgXfF3AM-gFcVPWZQhUA", "user_id": "zBlZkIyOTne45Q8lGpj-TA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/26/2018", "text": "Best place for tacos in Provo!

My favorite was actually the chicken taco; I was happy to see that it was grilled chicken instead of shredded.  The steak and marinated pork were slightly burnt, but it still tasted ok.  The green hot sauce could've had a little more kick to it, but I just mixed the red and green and it was perfect!  They have a punch card, so on your 10th visit you get a free meal!  It is a little run down, but I took my stuff to go, so it didn't really matter to me.  As long as the food tastes good though; I could care less about the interior of the place lol. I'd say definitely give this place a go, if you're looking for something cheap that tastes yummy!  (:"}, {"review_id": "rkUyqNHGuqCj2P8Cm6G1NA", "user_id": "78-RkblfI0hyEnHIfT7w4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/29/2016", "text": "This place is seriously legit.

Not only is this place and incredible value the food is very authentic and very flavorful so the best tacos I've had in a very long time. It is great value and very flavorful, and it's also excellent for people who are trying to be health-conscious about what they eat.My usual is the Carne Asada taco, however their chicken tacos were pretty good as well.Love it!!!!"}, {"review_id": "_UXW8PGfCGicqfsoSMF6Ig", "user_id": "3O4Gc27rz81ALNNwTrgDtw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "On the road again for a taco tour...this time celebrating taco tuesday in Utah County!

Taqueria el Vaquero has some pros and cons, but overall it's delicious and we've already eaten here three times.The tacos are good Mexican street tacos, with the usual trimmings of onions, pickled onions, cilantro, lime, and a selection of sauces. The sauces here are not the best: they're under seasoned and the green tomatillo sauce is very bland. But the taco meats are excellent, as are the corn tortillas. Any of the meats are great on a sope as well. The sopes are large and covered in good toppings. The standout here is the taco dorado de papas. Don't leave without ordering this. It's a fried corn tortilla taco stuffed with seasoned mashed potatoes and cheese. Delicious comfort food. Another surprisingly awesome item? The \"kids\" beans and rice. The rice is perfectly seasoned and the refried beans are almost a soup, delicious mixed with the rice. My second favorite taco is the chorizo, followed by the grilled fish.We have yet to try the other seafood selections, which look intriguing: shrimp soup and shrimp cocktail, plus a 7-seafood soup. We also noticed some interesting specials, like French fry nachos. I'll update when we sample these. In the case of the seafood, they'll have to try hard to outdo Laura's Kitchen down the street. Taqueria el Vaquero is cheap, too. Last time we ate there we ordered seven tacos and beans and rice and paid about $12."}, {"review_id": "hWkEZBNh2KiAO4tEf63RsQ", "user_id": "qvin_pYaNyLidXR3N2T27Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "6/9/2016", "text": "Deep marinate flavor explodes in your mouth on the carne asada.

The decor and atmosphere is authentic as well as you will most likely catch a game of futbol or telenovela on the TV.My recommendation is to order the taco \"El Chapo\" (isn't on the menu) which comes in a flour tortilla with melted cheese and carne asada. This taco is a lot bigger and more filling than all the others, so I like to get a Chapo and 1 or 2 of the pastor or pollo tacos (all for like $5.00).Compared to other places nearby, El Vaquero is cheaper, tastier and faster."}, {"review_id": "gsjZJz9lafIEsTIam_ZFXQ", "user_id": "7CfEJO9EF9td1rYkimHnRA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/12/2017", "text": "Another place that my husband and I love!!  We at least come here two Sunday's out of a month.  I love their Marinated Beef Tacos.
