Best salad hands down I've ever had! The atmosphere was quiet and friendly.

I am so glad I had the chance to dine here as I've heard great things about this place. We had reservations for 6:30 pm and were seated promptly after arriving. Since there were 6 of us in our group, we were seated in one of their half circle tables with wrap around seating.  It was nice since we all had plenty of room without feeling like we were squished. As we walked through the restaurant to our table, a majority of the tables were full. It was not as loud as I expected, which was a nice surprise considering how full the restaurant was. The restaurant is dimly lit and has modern decor. The atmosphere feels like you're in a fancy restaurant in a big city instead of in a strip mall. Within a few minutes of being seated, our waitress, Naomi, was over to take our drink order and deliver the bread service that they offer. She was an absolutely wonderful and friendly waitress! The restaurant was obviously busy, but she was patient with us while we needed some extra time to comb through their menu. She was also very attentive to our table, making sure our drinks never went empty and periodically checking in to make sure we were happy with our meals. Thank you for taking such good care of us, Naomi!Their drink menu is very extensive with a huge selection of beers, wines, specialty cocktails, mocktails, and of course sodas as well. There is definitely something for everyone, regardless if you drink alcohol or not. Their food menu offers a large selection dishes including soups and salads, burgers, paninis, pasta, steaks, fish, and daily specials. It was definitely a difficult decisions as many of their dishes sounded wonderful. In the end, I chose their king salmon special, which came with a seasonal vegetable side (I think it was asparagus) and a choice of another side (I chose the risotto). Everything was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. This salmon was the most perfectly cooked piece of fish I've ever had! Other dishes that our group ordered included steak, halibut, and the prosciutto wrapped salmon from the Dr. Lynn Wagner Food For Fuel menu. Everyone was happy with their meal. Since we were celebrating a birthday, we were offered one of their desserts. Thankfully, they did not do any sort of tacky singing or another attention-drawing activity, so we were able to enjoy the desserts in peace. Naomi brought by the tray that displayed all their desserts and we ended up choosing a slice of their carrot cake, which was HUGE and a slice of their better than sex cake. Both cakes were delicious and rich. The frosting on the carrot cake was one of the best frostings I've ever had, so definitely save room for it! Overall, we had a wonderful dining experience. I would certainly return in the future and recommend this place to someone looking for fine dining in the Green Bay Area."}, {"review_id": "AcvaegAlrtyt2rd8sSGeZQ", "user_id": "pUBTLAJCvlZWxjAj-wZBEg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/9/2018", "text": "This is my first time going to this place,I had the truffle pasta but I opted out the angel hair for the gluten free pasta. I would definitely recommending to opt the angel hair out for it. I tried my sisters who had the angel hair and she definitely likes mine better as well. The gluten free pasta has captured all the sauce perfectly into this crevices which make every bite perfect! As for the service, I like the service although I felt as though it could've been better stating the fact that it wasn't as busy as how it originally is. My sister didn't get offered for any refills for her glass of water nor did he notice her empty cup that had been sitting there for 20 min. It's no big deal because we asked for refills but it would've been nice if the waiter had asked.Overall a pretty good night, will be coming here more often to really have a set review about this place."}, {"review_id": "mzKqavjLt6JJT4ZMJANlSQ", "user_id": "eBSi_YB7h7Xh8EM386f05Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "I ate dinner at Plae Bistro this week. This is a charming restaurant with beautiful chandeliers, cozy booths and chairs. Since I was by myself, I sat at the bar and service was prompt. Drink menu is fairly extensive with plenty of beers on tap, craft cocktails, and very good wine list by the bottle, and a few by the glass. I would have liked to see a few more glass options. Menu is pretty eclectic and there is something for everyone. I ordered the Halibut based on the bar tenders recommendation. It came was grilled asparagus and either the mashed potatoes or the crab pepper risotto. The fish was served with a orange flavored sauce. While I waited for my fish, I was served complimentary cheddar bread and it was amazing. The bread was served warm with a herbed butter, olive oil and and olive tempanade. The bread alone is reason enough to visit. My fish was prepared well and it was good but it wasn't amazing. For the price ($36), i expected a little more oomph! The asparagus and the crab risotto were fine. They also have walleye, Tuna, salmon and Sea Bass on the menu. Apparently the grilled sea bass flown in from Hawaii has been a #1 seller for 9 years. Had it not been the $45 price tag, I may have gotten that instead. I think this is great dining spot in town, but I feel some of the entree prices are a little absurd."}, {"review_id": "0XDqpkDnxv2xJbTPnLAvOQ", "user_id": "iXDNrZNhPuiO0CWXX6x8ZQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2017", "text": "I've been here to eat just once, but I actually really enjoy just coming for a glass of wine at the bar.  The atmosphere here is more upscale for the area (though there seems to be a bit of a trend in this direction in the Green Bay area).  It's a large space, but it doesn't feel like it with the echoes and the high volume.The dinner I had here was fantastic and delicious, and I've never gone wrong with their wine selection.  They also have delicious looking holiday drink specials (salty nut roll martini, for one).  I've always had decent service as well, whether it was a full meal or just a drink at the bar.  The servers have always been willing to provide recommendations.It's not really near anything else, which I can't figure out if that's good or bad (upscale-ish dining in a strip mall?).  Prices are also high for the area (I'm from Chicago and these prices seem more in line with places down there).  If you're doing it for a special occasion I could see it, but that does make it a bit less accessible for more frequent trips.Their holiday decorations are also on point!"}, {"review_id": "S0An8XkB9xLqE4R8DBUqpA", "user_id": "wNWAhR5lwX8cWsxUQU_6Tw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/25/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Second time here and walked in with high expectations as my first visit was outstanding. We were seated towards the back, close to one of the kitchen entrances/exits - this is important to note because of what happened towards the end of our dinner.We went with the amazing halibut and steak topped with crab dinner entrees with risotto and grilled asparagus. The halibut was on point - I am a bit of a halibut snob so when a place does it well, I remember. I ordered the steak medium but received it medium rare - which is pushing it for me. I don't need my meat to mooooo. Given how packed the restaurant was, I chose not to send the dish back and just tolerated the warm, red center.Bread plate was terrific, 3 different types of bread, 3 butters/sauces to accompany. Here's the part of the evening where I grew frustrated. Service had been great until we asked for more water. Again and again. I had to speak up THREE times to get someone to pour more water for us. Why was it so hard? It was out of character to experience this at Plae Bistro. It took 5 minutes for someone (not our server) to finally come by and get us some H2O. I understand the restaurant is popular and busy, especially during the holiday season. But refilling water glasses shouldn't be that hard so we were disappointed by how we had to chase down someone for something so minimal. That's why I'm giving only 3 stars to Plae this time. Service ended on disappointing note."}, {"review_id": "Azwqm9O0NR99h1o69fR1YA", "user_id": "p7TjV--wUSeDUObKCFpeJA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "I was weary and starving after a crazy day working in Green Bay - but also on Whole 30 that day and needing something emotionally and physically satisfying. A quick search on Yelp led me to Plae Bistro and it was exactly what I needed.The atmosphere was comfortable, but elegant. The service was spectacular. And the food? Oh my goodness.I got the ahi salad (blackened, thanks to the recommendation from my server. I had my doubts, but I was wrong). This salad was way more than I expected, considering what most restaurants get away with serving for the price they charge these days.  But this salad was overflowing with tasty, fresh, and colorful veggies and fruit. The fish was tender and not too fatty, and very flavorful - which I needed, because Whole 30 can be boring ;)With all elements combined, I left feeling satisfied, refreshed, and ready for the next phase of the day.

The food is just as good as I remember it to be! We were lucky enough to be able to eat outside on the patio also! The inside is really nice as well though. We got the tuna bites for an app and OMG these are outstanding. Get them blackened! Just wow on these. They come with an awesome mayo sauce on top of fresh tomatoes and avocado. The bread also looked amazing, though I didn't have any. They give you three little sides to go with. For dinner, I got the tuna salad with salmon instead of tuna and it was also perfect. It comes with avo, feta, mangoes, jicama and the salmon was perfectly done. My friend got the apple and pear salad and it was also top notch. DEFINITELY GO HERE!! You won't be disappointed.

The atmosphere is upscale casual with decor to make you feel like you're in Martha Stewart's wonderland. First off - their drinks are insane. I had trouble picking a specialty cocktail from the menu because they all sounded awesome. I landed on a Bearcat Mule and it was phenomenal. I went with a locally brewed cider after and slightly regretted switching it up. The cider was good but the Mule was effing amazing. I chose this place for dinner because of their extensive vegetarian options. For an appetizer, we got the grilled cheese bites with tomato bisque soup. These were so cute and so delicious. I've never had a grilled cheese thsy was so flavorful. I went with the grilled apple and walnut salad for my main dish. It came with candied butternut squash and goat cheese. My only complaint, which was partially my fault, is that the salad was far too sweet. I put way too much dressing on and it was just sweet with sweet with sweet. It would have been great if there were a tart element with the salad. My brother got the Kobe burger and demolished it in minutes. Other dishes were a chicken panini, which was the size of a small child, seafood pesto, and an eggplant burger. No one had any complaints and almost everyone ate all of their food. Definitely will go back again. I may not get that same salad but there are plenty of other options on their menu for a limited diet."}, {"review_id": "lnkmfGvBqnIE8yEKoQTZDA", "user_id": "nQXYM9GsNY-4nTppLn2ZJQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "You guys, I love Plae Bistro. I've gone several times now and while it feels like it should be more of a fancy special occasion place, (somewhere you go to celebrate a birthday or a promotion,) it's also great for a casual night out with many reasonably priced items on the menu. It's always tempting to get an appetizer because their food is so good, but don't forget they always bring warm rolls with butter, oil and olive tapenade. If you get an appetizer and and entree you're sure to bring home leftovers... not necessarily a bad thing. The Pecan Encrusted Walleye, the Scallops and the Sea Bass are my family's go-to favorites if you're interested in a \"Big Plate\". The Beet Burger or the Plae Burger are awesome sandwich options. If you're looking for something lighter, their soups are delish. Honestly though, it's hard to go wrong."}, {"review_id": "Uhpo5tNDDnXGruKeF2Lwzg", "user_id": "qc-TFwkaiQN4b7QfJslWEw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/28/2017", "text": "Any special occasion?

Got there just in time for happy hour specials, I opted for a glass of wine, piquitos moscato to be exact. One of the bonuses about this restaurant is bread service. I ordered more on the simple side and had mushroom and tortellini chicken alfredo and it was amazing! One of the more flavorful dishes I've had here! Creamy and cheesy to perfection and the tortellini was freshly stuffed with a mixture of cheeses.My boyfriend had the stuffed chicken which was covered in delicious cherry gastrique on a bed of what was quite honestly some of the best rissoto I've ever had!After dinner they bring out a tray that has 6-7 desserts and they run through what they are and let you make a selection! We had a piece of apple crumble cheesecake that I continued to obsess over an hour after we left dinner. Delicious. The whole dining experience itself took about 45 minutes. So we did feel kind of rushed.
