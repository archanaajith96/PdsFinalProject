Get it once and you'll be coming back time and time again. Give it a shot and I promise you, you'll be back!  I might just see you there."}, {"review_id": "aZ8OnrM5qIDCsSJ_EfybYA", "user_id": "U3Okobx5jY0NA4Nd_kOJog", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/14/2017", "text": "We had a road trip and stayed in town for a few days and found this place.We grabbed food to go and OMG the sslad was amazing especially the dressing I want the recepie of this dressing never tried that begore it was called Cranberry orange maple venigarate but it was so mild perfect!

There. I've said it. Unquestionably the best coffee in town. Michael opened this place in January, 2012. Since then, I have been there more than 200 times. I guess that qualifies as a habit. There are chains like Starbucks, Satellite, Krispy Kreme, and Badass, among others.  These serve coffee that is inferior to that served up at the really good places, like Grove Café & Market, Golden Crown Panaderia,  Michael Thomas Coffee, Napoli Coffee, and now Cafe Bella Coffee. Cafe Bella Coffee is the brainchild and dream come rue of Michael Gonzales, a classically trained chef, nonstop talker, and coffee freak. He knows coffee. And tea, too. Bella has become somewhat of a community center for artists, musicians (there is often live music on some evenings--watch the Facebook page), car collectors, needlepoint ladies, and whomever loves coffee, delicious panini,, and good conversation. You know. A coffee house. I grew up in coffee houses, as did many of you.Michael has told me:\"The coffee served at Cafe Bella Coffee is single source locally micro roasted specialty coffee. We offer a rotating selection of coffees from around the globe for our daily drip coffee. We rotate coffee that is ordered in a 14 day supply. This way we are able to expose our drip coffee customers to a wide range of amazing flavor notes and tones. Customers enjoy tasting and talking about the different characteristics of the drip coffee we offer. We carry at any time 2-4 different coffees and sell whole bean by the 1/2 and 1lb. We are happy to offer professional grinding if needed.\"Our espresso is our only blend that has been created to maximize our equipment capabilities delivery that wonderful crema in every shot we serve. Comprised of no less than 4 single source beans from around the world our signature espresso is a favorite of our customers.\"Our decaf is Fair Trade Organic and is decaffeinated by mountain water steam process resulting in a less dry or \"musty\" decaf with excellent aroma and flavor profile. If we did not tell you it was decaf you may not know.\"We do not offer a French Roast, we feel the darker french roasts tend to rob artisan beans of their natural flavors. Dark French Roast is used often in the commodity coffee market as an aid to mask impurities or age. Many people can experience coffee after breath, upset stomach, headaches and bitter after taste which is often be associated with the carbon properties in French Roast coffee.\" Is the food any good? Yup. *Slow Smoked Carne Panini.We Nuevo Mexicanos are accustomed to having Carne Adovada slow cooked in red chile, but this panini was filled with pork, baby field greens, mozzarella cheese, and a juicy mayo-based sauce and expertly grilled on the press until the cheese  hit that just melted liquid state. This is by no means a dry panini, but five paper napkin sloppy. The fillings  exploded onto my taste buds. Best panini I have ever had. Anyplace.*Turkey Panini My  companion is not a pork fan, so Michael built her a sliced turkey panini with baby field greens and the same mozzarella treatment. I have not seen such a look of sheer delight on her face before, and we have shared many meals together. Best that she has ever had, too. Two Best in Show dishes so far. *Espresso Chocolate Peanut Butter BrownieMichael thought that we needed something sweet to end the lunch with, so he brought us this brownie to share. One of my all-time favorite candies is the venerable Reese's Peanut Butter Cup (yours too?). Add a hint of chopped nuts and some powdered espresso, and you have this amazing brownie. If the panini were Best in Show, the brownie was Best of Best in Show for the whole year. My mouth is watering as I write these words. OMG! *Taco TuesdayOutstanding. Get there early. They sell out fast. ¡Feliz cumpleaños!"}, {"review_id": "_1t2ewj1iklwLBhFax30HQ", "user_id": "ZiYTSAHzzwSSg97jxphtCw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/15/2018", "text": "I came here after getting my haircut at stay Traditional Barbershop the coffee and smoothies are good.

A little reminiscent for me, considering I grew up in Rio. I'm a caffeine fiend and I am always looking for a good place and I don't like to visit starsucks if possible. Sorry. I had to say it. I said it. Don't judge me. I know you feel the same way. Okay, I'm done. Cafe Bella. It's a cute place. Nestled in a small shopping center off of golf course heading north into Rio Rancho. Kind off the beaten path if you are not heading into Rio, but certainly worth the trip if you are near by. The digs are cozy, I could easily find myself just killing some time enjoying one of their many espresso drinks! They also offer food, and I am talking food, food, not just the typical pastry! They offer real breakfast, like waffles and eggs, then there's also sandwiches or paninis and then on certain nights, street tacos! That's what I am talking about. Why aren't they closer to me? Boo. Hiss! The barista, cook, cashier was just delightful! She was so helpful and helped me order a drink that was a little bit more then just espresso (I was going to get the black eye) and I was very happy with what she made me. It wasn't too sweet, which is something I really don't like about most coffee house drinks, they are so sweet that you don't really get to taste and enjoy the coffee itself. It was also the perfect temperature! It wasn't sooo hot to scald your tongue, so you could drink it right away. It kept warm too. I was so happy with the choice to stop here. I look forward to coming back when I have time to stay and chill for a while, perhaps partake in some of the eats they have to offer as well. Until next time Cafe Bella, you can be sure I will return!"}, {"review_id": "kYXGxooxRvca7JBlpMB8uw", "user_id": "93nplV3SmvyC7MUyZELVrA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/2/2016", "text": "My go to place in Rio Rancho for some early morning drank.  Once you walk into the door, you are greeted even if they are busy satisfying another order.  They have so many selections and one day I will try the food here but if you want a tasty drink, you have come to the right spot.This place has a certain type of quiet aspect to it.

Love the atmosphere and sense of community I felt while chatting it up with the owner about their beans, and some of the specifics of the operation. I ordered a Bella Mocha (delicioso!) and she gave my son a cup of whipped cream with chocolate drizzle which totally made his day!!! I learned about their weekend happenings, and some of the food they offer....I was still so full from my previous visit to the Pho Bar in Rio Rancho earlier, but she had me salivating describing the breakfast sandwiches, street tacos (offered Tuesdays, and Friday and Saturday nights), their weekend waffles and Sunday Brunch, salads and paninis...I seriously can't wait to go back!!!

I've tried lots of coffee in this city, but Bella has some of the best there is. In the winter storm of 2017, I found myself crawling through slow Albuquerque traffic and decided to stop by the Bella's coffee house location located off paseo and eagle ranch. I needed some nice warm coffee to compliment this extremely cold day. They have many interesting and unique combinations. I decided to try their toasted coconut mocha. This coffee was the BOMB! The flavor of the drink was really good but the flavor of the coffee really stuck out and I would have to say that this is one of the most delicious roasts that I've ever tried. These people really know their stuff. The prices may be just a little more than Star... whatever the hell, but for me it is totally worth the extra few cents to support an awesome, local spot.

I've been here 8-10 times cuz they're one of the only local coffee shops in Rio Rancho. I liked Cafe Bella's coffee, but their customer service today left a bad taste in my mouth. First, they made my friend stand at the counter for ~10 minutes while the young man (only one working the counter on a Sunday?!) made about 6 espresso drinks, including the one I had ordered. The chef couldn't be bothered to look up and acknowledge her. My drink was not great as it usually is, lacked some flavor and weak foam, probably cuz the young man making drinks was rushed. Second, we were sitting in the back against the wall and I was showing my friend a video on my phone - the chef came over in less than a minute and asked us to turn it down so it didn't disrupt. Ok, I get it, but it came across with a poorly veiled rude attitude. Sure the space is tall and empty, but they play music and have the ceiling fans on high speed which is why I had to turn up the volume in the first place. Third, I'll admit I have never tried their breakfast, but after watching it prepared today I definitely will not. Scrambled eggs on Costco bagels with some cream cheese and bacon is not worth what they're charging, and the chef cooks them one at a time which means slow food as well as slow coffee. Summary: sorely disappointed and probably will not return."}, {"review_id": "GC-Z82JtWxD8F6E7ZBsWAQ", "user_id": "RfBFwLbbQVOJjp3AkGRlLA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/19/2017", "text": "I frequent coffee shops often for work, almost daily, and I've been on the hunt for a place to camp out on the Westside.

(Not before tho...)Being injured and beyoooond tired of the Starbuck's near us- My husband drove 15 minutes out of his way to get me a breakfast sandwich. I found you guys here on Yelp (so yes, Yelp deserves to be taken seriously as a business generation tool). Pro's: The drinks were great. First green tea matcha latte I've had that was perfectly balanced- awesome work there!Cons: The food could use some serious improvement. I got the Breakfast Bagel Sandwich. Owner below said in a reply on this page, that everything is fresh. Well I know FRESH and my bagel NOT. It was dry and somewhat stale. The staleness of that bagel took away from my enjoyment of the wonderful flavors of the eggs and sundried tomato spread. So please, find a way to make the bagels fresher :-)I just wouldn't spend $7 + tax for a bagel sandwich with a dry stale bagel again. My husband got the Carne Adovada Bagel. He's not* a picky eater, and when I asked him how his was he said, \"Meh, it was just sort of plain and didn't have a lot of flavor.\"So really, for the price you pay, you want a bit more \"wow.\" Cafe Bella, you guys are close, just 10-20% more effort with the food and you're there! Last but not least, The PRICE??!!:   I'm from Boulder, Colorado with lots of \"all organic farm to table\" type of places toting higher prices than much of the country.  (Just in case you thought I'm the cheap type)- I'm USED TO paying more for this kind of stuff- but seriously I could get a similar sandwich in Boulder for LESS, with way more bacon on it and super fresh bread..So really, does a $7+ breakfast sandwich make sense for this area and \"meh\" quality? How about charging like $5.50? And/or improve the freshness...Just my sense."}, {"review_id": "2SIIzGu5gxLrCXPVXpoZew", "user_id": "TEZS3Z-bbfI17QWARnjO3w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "7/26/2017", "text": "Love this place!
