Do the servers not depend on tips. My friend wanted nachos I wanted pizza so we got both, wow big mistake worst nachos I ever had, the weirdest thing was this place doesn't have salsa they serve nachos with marinara sauce. I mean come on salsa is not expensive to keep on stalk. The pizza was better but nothing special a thick greasy type crust, funny thing is for a place called the big cheese you would think the cheese would be plentiful but it was not and pretty flavorless. Big disappointment."}, {"review_id": "Pk6gFj2Ucevy8gLtbF4M9w", "user_id": "Ptmy1F8-Rp8133gfz-yrMQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "Went here because we had a lord of the pies coupon for a free small pizza. The small was still large enough for two people to share, especially if your order a side or app. I liked how you could choose how you wanted your pizza made (thin crust, original, whole wheat or Italian style.) We ordered the Italian style with pepperoni and sausage. I loved it! Was crunchy but still soft, and you could really taste the marinara sauce. My husband didn't like it as much as I did. We also ordered a side of the meatballs and sausage. That was really good as well, it came with bread which was nice because I could dip it in that delicious marinara sauce. The only downside was I expected more drink options since this place was called a \"pub.\" They only had three beers on tap, Narragansett, coors lite and blue moon. My husband said the blue moon tasted flat as well. I just settled for a water. The decor was meh, nothing exciting. Looks like the place hasn't been touched or redecorated in decades. Would return for the food but not the drink or atmosphere!"}, {"review_id": "ALaiwZdN21GrLDjAMMLKIw", "user_id": "6Q3PmFEtDB1_ZarZ3zeKMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/27/2018", "text": "One of my friends and I's favorite stop.

They have a large parking lot behind the building and inside there are two distinct dining areas, a small and casual self serve pizza area where you can order at the counter and sit in a booth and a more traditional (but still casual) dining room with full service bar. They serve the same great food in both dining areas, just decide which area you feel most comfortable in and how much time you have to spend to there. Tonight we ordered some soup, the Popeye (spinach pie) stuffed with a Greek salad (my favorite) and a few pizzas but we have had delicious sandwiches, calzones, and nachos from here before too. The service is always friendly and I'm impressed that the cooks/owners in the kitchen know so many of their customers by name - proof that when you deliver a quality product and excellent service that customers continue to return."}, {"review_id": "8xdQKtpOXFymAw93KJmXiw", "user_id": "lOJn1pYsRPW8m_0Sjsv4Kw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "I found this little gem through YELP!! It was my first time here. I can't say enough about this old school pub!  The waitstaff was so welcoming and attentive. The portions are huge! We started with the stuffed mozzarella bread with there red sauce on the side. It really was outstanding. The next course was a salad with there own dressing which was so fresh! No bag salad here. The dressing was so good!  For me it could have ended there but then the bread came and it was so fresh and tasty.  Our main meal was brought next. My husband had the veal and pasta which was excellent and I had the Santa Fe pasta with spinach. Yeah that was crazy good but there was no way I could fit it in. They provide take home I'm sure because it's no secret a lot goes home with you. While we were enjoying our meal we could see there's a lot of take out traffic. This is one little gem we're happy to have found through the best app!  We will definitely be going"}, {"review_id": "o82RWVmlq-Wge7458oMnAw", "user_id": "Av2tUHw-4ZE2R0QKN9UvYg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/7/2017", "text": "Been here twice thanks to the passports we bought through RI Food Fights. Have had a great experience both times.Staff is friendly. And the dining area seats a good number of people. The decor is kind of reminiscent of the 70s in some ways, but not in an outdated musky basement kind of way.Nice selection of pizzas, grinders, calzones, & pasta dishes. Reasonably priced. Food is tasty & comforting. Not 5 star good, but definitely restaurant quality. Portion sizes are really good too.Highly recommend the soups; the beef minestrone & chicken noodle soups were awesome.

I was kind of hoping this could become a regular destination every week. Inside is quite nice, not what you would expect from the outside, it's bigger, homey-er and a little more fancy than you would expect inside, but a very lively, family oriented atmosphere. We ordered the crazy sticks with garlic butter as an appetizer. Fresh made bread sticks with garlic butter and sauce in the side. They are huge and tasty. I couldn't decide if I enjoyed them more with or without the nice portion of sauce. The garlic, oregano and other spices add a little unexpected bite. They weren't as buttery as I expected, but they were tasty, and held us over while we waited for out other food. For the main meal, we ordered a half pepperoni/half cheese pizza and a meatball calzone. Both were delicious and served super hot. The pizza is great. Excellent crust. Medium thick, crisp, airy, substantial, buttery, delicious. The sauce and cheese were perfect as was the very generous amount of crisp, high quality pepperoni. It's a really good pie. The calzone featured soft, tasty meatballs in a great sauce, with nice sharp provolone cheese (we asked for the sandwich to calzone conversion rather than the regular meatball calzone that features ricotta cheese).The service was great. Fast, friendly. The prices are as well. The Big Cheese is going to be a regular spot for us and a big favorite of ours moving forward.

Nowhere, I responded, the reason deep dish sucks outside of Chicago is that the pizza makers more often than not parboil the crust to save time (yuck!). However, I later remembered, The Big Cheese's original--while not technically deep dish--reminds of me of the pan pizza I grew up with back in Chi. For those who have had it, it is similar to Pequod's crust in Chicago (without the cheese baked into it) or perhaps like Jet's pizza or Sicilian style pizza except Big Cheese cuts it into regular pizza triangle slices rather than squares. The pizza is just good, nothing earth shattering, nothing fancy, just good, old-fashioned pizza. So high marks for that.What adds the BIG in the Big Cheese for me though is the service. One thing I miss about family style restaurants in the midwest is how genuine and nice people are--the kind of people who ask \"How are you\" and wait for an answer b/c they really want to know. While New Englanders have their own charm, in family-style restaurants all over the region, there seems to be a higher number than average of brusque even rude servers who kind of stand there and stare at you silently with dead eyes waiting for you to order something. They may or may not be zombies, but I swear it is a regional thing (especially with the Massholes). At Big Cheese though, I have never received anything but warmth and courtesy, and sometimes even a \"hello my name is\" first, which would be par for the course in the South or Midwest, but comes as a surprise at times in New England (many New Englanders I've spoken to about this have protested saying \"We're not fake!\" but then also get rather shellshocked when they actually get good service from non-fake people elsewhere. Again, regional differences). I'm digressing on the restaurant service anthropology, but my point is The Big Cheese & Pub has good food, the pizza crust is made fresh daily, and the service is just the perfect slices of pepperoni on top.The Big Cheese, it's a Craaaaaanston institution for over 30 years (and no wonder)!"}, {"review_id": "c5HliM3jVv1gotNtjGw91g", "user_id": "mDIiJFbG5cNz9-taiGAASQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/23/2017", "text": "I had Big Cheese bookmarked for a while, but after it was recommended to me (when I was desperately seeking something somewhat similar to Chicago style pizza in RI), I knew I had to hurry in and give it a try. I am glad I finally ventured in! Upon walking in the door near the parking lot, I was confused as to where I should stand. Apparently there is a take-out section in the front and you wait by the back door for a table. At the time we came in, it appeared nobody saw us so I simply asked a worker how to get a table. He apologized and sat us right away. No big deal!bFast & friendly service all around. No complaints.Onto the food: the mozzarella bread is a must-try. Huge, cheap, delicious, cheese overload, and the perfect amount of garlic (unlike some places that put way too much garlic on their cheesy bread). The pizza was fantastic. My husband and I got a half cheese/half pepperoni (as we always do when trying a new place). It was surprisingly filling and unexpectedly yummy. The outdated decor of the place may suggest that the food is low-quality. But, they clearly have been doing something right for a number of years, so why fix what isn't broken? It really is one of the best pizzas I've tried in Rhode Island. Thick, buttery, cheesy crust, small amount of sauce, then cheese, cheese, and some more cheese. All good in my book! The crust is definitely the best part. Too bad the middle pieces don't have that delicious end crust. Definitely satisfied my craving for a different style pizza. Bonus: super cheap. 3 beers, mozzarella bread, large pizza, & a 20% tip was all under $50. Not bad, Big Cheese, not bad!I'll be back for sure."}, {"review_id": "mqr41TRYnYPBA4NnggGqow", "user_id": "gWQRST7CW32V4qNCUnWJ4Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/23/2016", "text": "Get the Greek salad; you won't be disappointed. Every time I go to The Big Cheese I split a Greek salad with whomever I'm with. The dressing is delicious. It's topped with a mound of feta cheese. The lettuce is always fresh. I haven't had any of the pasta dishes yet. The pizza crust is the perfect thickness. It holds its form when you pick up a slice. They don't skimp on the cheese. And the cheese is always perfectly crisped on top. The mozzarella bread is a favorite of my boyfriend's. They stuff the bread with the perfect amount of mozzarella and top it with a delicious combination of spices. The marinara sauce for dipping is the perfect pairing. If I don't want to overdue it on my cheese intake, I'll order the crazy sticks. They're basically breadsticks that are about a foot long, covered in the same spices that top the mozzarella bread, and paired with marinara sauce."}, {"review_id": "AOvD_cEvT4gkHCGnsvAWdw", "user_id": "bhVD3k4tjYX0Df2lebwvQA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "I frequent The Big Cheese.
