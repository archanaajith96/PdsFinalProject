I was instantly hooked!Their brick and mortar location is nestled in a quaint space with about 6 tables and a Pinball machine. My go-to every time are the PBJ & BLT soft tacos. The PBJ has jalapeños, black beans and pulled pork. I like to add the corn salsa to mine. And the BLT is the classic mouthwatering  bacon, lettuce and tomato.We decided to try something new and got the Avocado Fritters. They were creamy with a lightly fried coating that \"melted in your mouth\".  Im thankful for the love and joy Poco Loco has consistently brought to my life"}, {"review_id": "3vMZ2AmbNM1XcBblx6JSmQ", "user_id": "io_M76rPJlewnCPIS0GV8w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "*I apologize for the late review, I just realized I didn't hit submit back in October* Prior to this visit I had enjoyed tacos from their food truck and was extremely impressed so I was excited to give their shop a try. Stopped here with a friend and I was not disappointed.  The shop is small but cute. They have a counter where you order and pick up your food as well as a few tables available on a seat your self basis.  When we walked in all of the tables were full, so once one opened up we grabbed it.  Our food was up pretty quickly (less then 10 minutes) considering how busy they were.    The tacos were just as satisfying as I remembered, full of flavor and super fresh!  I had \"The Green Monstah\" in the form of tacos. The guacamole and fresh jalapeños combined with the salsa verde was a party in my mouth!  I can't wait to return to try some other tacos/ burritos that they offer."}, {"review_id": "gaZRnM7u17CnY4QYt-_DGg", "user_id": "b3EJ82I-aep5pSFPwyVNTw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/20/2017", "text": "Very cool place. I'll let the food speak for it self. A BLT Taco, Caesar Tacos, of course gigantic burritos with also funky items I have yet to try. It's a hit or miss with wait time because people are making this a real gem. But the cool thing is you can of course call ahead. Inexpensive and the duality is worth it. Make it a stop if you're in the area! Extra tip, closed on Mondays, and they have a food truck Outdoor seating, limited but for the most part it does keep moving! Ok enough rambling, overall very good spot to catch a quick bite. Oh I forgot, its BYOB with no cup charge, dope huh!!!Ok now I'm done...till next review!"}, {"review_id": "KKxec2plLhpTtNRYHnrCzQ", "user_id": "ATbClROKzPaAfjnq7dT3Yg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "Brief Line Up Front: Fresh ingredients, nicely prepared meats, that are like a subdued version of Latino burritos, tacos, and chips. They do not use a heavy amount of cilantro, cumin, and other savory seasonings you see in traditional Mexican and Latino dishes. Great for people who can't handle super savory dishes.Wife and I stopped by here after talking with a guy in a check out lane at a grocery store nearby. Guy was really nice and told us of this local burrito joint. It is really popular, while we waited for our food for dine in on their six or so tables, about 20-22 people strolled in and out and did take out. Wife and I ordered roasted pork nachos, a potato/chorizo burrito, and a ground beef burrito. The nachos are huge, chips are fresh and it is topped with a ton of fresh vegetables and toppings. The roast pork was really well cooked, nice and soft, not over cooked. Typically with Latino roast pork you expect a heavy cumin and oregano taste, this was just a standard well cooked roast pork.The Chorizo/Potato burrito was a decent size, done mission style with rice, beans, and other fixings inside. I figured since it had Chorizo it would have a nice heavy spice, the potato dulled the hit and it was tasty but didn't have the traditional oomph I would expect with Chorizo dishes. This was intentionally done this way and tasted good. Wife enjoyed her ground beef burrito which was mission style as well. Beef was done in traditional American style seasoning.Wife and I were happily full. This was not the normal taco counter we were used to on the West Coast, but I cannot be mad at a place that does a good job making what they do.  Think of this as Mexican food done for the New England palette. Good food is good food."}, {"review_id": "G6Rfbwe4UEphmpl5sRo6GQ", "user_id": "AmW5t2LjZb2zKKdyztxeoQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "The hubby and I were checking out at nearby V-Mart when we were wondering how long it would take to get to our usual taco/burrito shop when the gentleman in front of us heard us and had thought we were talking about Poco Loco. We had never been until today but decided to check it out since we like checking out new places when we can. As soon as we walked in and looked at the menu, I set my expectations on the low side especially when I saw that ground beef was among the meat options...I went with the ground beef burrito w/ pinto beans, while the husband went with the chorizo-potato burrito and an order of the pan sheet nachos to share. The place seemed pretty busy with people coming in and out for to-go orders or eating in so maybe I might have set my expectations too low...As soon as the food came in and took the first bite, I had set my expectations just right. The food was good and can tell the ingredients were fresh but...it lacked that pop of flavor that you find at a legit Mexican joint. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my meal but being a person of Latino descent and having authentic Mexican food almost all my life, I could tell this place caters to those that like a more subdued version of Mexican.If you're the kind of person that likes Mexican but without the heavy spices, this place is for you. If you're looking for authentic Mexican, I recommend going elsewhere. I doubt I'll be back but was glad I at least tried this place out and walked away satisfied."}, {"review_id": "8bOwCglxTat-yLm20n5oqQ", "user_id": "H7_6Xbh4VxqLbzavqKg_0g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/24/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Got an assortment of soft tacos to go tonight. They were really good, with super  fresh ingredients, generously sized, and well priced. . As  mentioned by fellow Yelpers, the food is Americanized Mexican. What I found disappointing was that the soft taco shells are flour based, rather than corn. I love the usual 2 layer soft tacos. They add so much flavor and texture, and are healthier also. I wish they were an option. That said, the taco fillings here are top quality... wholesome and not greasy at all.   Service is friendly. The food is well packaged for take out too, always appreciated."}, {"review_id": "fhHgnEUFsCOPXc_-q1_DZQ", "user_id": "0MFyg4QIUCZ03YZ0A2lyAA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/16/2017", "text": "Poco Loco Tacos has become my new go-to lunch spot for tacos! The prices are very reasonable, which is rare these days, and the portions are generous. Yesterday I tried the roasted mushroom taco, soyrizo and potato taco, and seasoned beef taco. They were all very fresh, delicious, and filling. However, the mushroom taco was a bit bland...but nothing that hot sauce can't fix!Now, the way tacos are made vary from shop to shop in RI. Don't go to Poco Loco expecting an authentic Mexican meal. It's definitely Americanized but it's not necessarily a bad thing. They also pay attention to details when it comes to preparing take-out which I can totally appreciate.I can't wait to go back and try out some of the other menu items!"}, {"review_id": "QtcrLGW801oxJdEU57U5NA", "user_id": "A7_RUaX9r9CfNbPdhI_6Jg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2017", "text": "I would say this place is a good spot for a quick lunch.

I am a huge taco lover and have always wanted to try this place. For all my cranstonians, this dine in or take out place is not too far from the large funeral home on the corner of broad st. They have a nice varied menu of generic stuff and specialty stuff. No tax is charged to your meal. I got a chicken taco and the BLT taco and the quality of ingredients I felt were very fresh. Large pieces of grilled chicken, and the bacon taco had tons of little bacon bits. The lettuce and tomatoes were very fresh. It's a small location but spacious enough on the inside. They have a parking lot to the left or you just park on the street. My only complaint was they should have more drink options.
