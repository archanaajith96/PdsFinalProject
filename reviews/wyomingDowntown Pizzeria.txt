Great staff and owner!! Service is extremely warm, courteous and friendly. The pizza is the best in town (especially if you like NY style). My family and I just got home from Grandpa's Pizza, we ordered cannolis to go and they never made it out of the car. Totally scrumptious!! We have given up on commercial pizza, it is all the same, just garbage! BTW, did I mention that the cannolis are the best I've ever had!! Seriously!!Go for the pizza, but save room for a cannoli..."}, {"review_id": "VbGx3bGR9oYdYLsqLeb6Ag", "user_id": "jZPR8yG9o0kT7MKXwHfqKg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/20/2018", "text": "We stopped for an overnight in Cheyenne and pizza sounded good! I noticed this place serves by the slice so we stopped in. We ordered 2 pepperoni slices, 1 cheese, an order of garlic knots and a veggie calzone. The slices were large, very thin. The calzone was average, not too flavorful and had more cheese than veggies. The marina sauce that came with the garlic knots was awful. Tasted like a straight up can of tomato juice. The garlic knots - AMAZING. I wish I had just ordered them!!! Soooo garlic-y and delicious. I'd go back again just for those. Service was great as well, very friendly."}, {"review_id": "_1DUCAevRKnHT1WVRmfENg", "user_id": "SdBeQBLQ0ql14uju5R_i3g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Stopped in for lunch on our way home from CO to WY.

Got to try the Green Chili Pizza that they were playing around with. Must say it was pretty good, reminded me of a smothered burrito I had in Denver. The pepperoni and combo was probably the best I have had all year.

How does this place have such a high rating? I came expecting some delicious NY style fare, what we got was some Ellio's style pizza, very bland. That's not the worst part, this place was filthy, beyond dirty. There was dust & dirt & candy sprinkles (yeah, I don't know either?) on every surface, from the floors to the napkin holders to the Parmesan cheese containers. No thanks. I lost my appetite the minute I sat down & had a good look around. My husband & son ate their pizza, buuuuut they're not so picky about cleanliness."}, {"review_id": "69UaOrGRRDZhdoXwgE3yzQ", "user_id": "KteDN6_SjAyBO8NaR03mnQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/20/2017", "text": "Had a great low key pizza lunch today.
