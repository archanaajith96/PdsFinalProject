BEYOND AMAZING!!!We just moved here from Los Angeles and if Pecan Grill was in LA - I would have NEVER left!If you want to have the BEST service ever ask to sit in Diego's section or take a seat at the bar and spend time with Sarah. These two are awesome! The Pecan beer is nothing short of exceptional and again - the service is second to none."}, {"review_id": "NL9WrDHqxII4M7-xWmKzkw", "user_id": "UoDRNX-LG8PVARpImam8zg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "This place is trying too hard to be fancy, but the food and service are both mediocre.I had the steak tacos, which were under seasoned and over cooked. There was way too much pickled onion, which was unevenly chopped so you get these huge chunks of vinegar flavored onion. All the sauces that should have been in the tacos were on the side in little plastic cups.My wife had the beer can chicken. It was overcooked and dry. The sweet potato fries had cinnamon and sugar on them, which was gross.I had the dark and the light flights of beer. It was all pretty good. The pale ale, pecan ale, and stout were very good.Our waiter was not very attentive and it took a very long time to get our check."}, {"review_id": "uz46lQw0MJ6jU3h2t2EYXA", "user_id": "F3DG3m145tI5-J47l8GoFg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "11/28/2017", "text": "Short form: My bill, for 1, not including tip was 40: 2 beers, a salad and an entree. I don't know that I $20 liked the chicken, so based on price I wouldn't eat here again, just come for beer. Be prepared to stay a long while.I am a dark beer drinker and they were out of stouts. The server suggested a mix of their Pecan ale and nut brown, which was good.The food here is good. However, be aware that they will up sell you without indicating something is an upsell. When one pays 20 for a chicken dish and is asked if you would prefer a salad or soup, it implies it comes with it. The salad was an extra charge, but it wasn't presented as so. To top it off, service is on the low end of mediocre. I came in after the dinner rush on a Saturday around 730p. It took about 20 mins for the server to  to get my food order after ordering my beer, another 25 after my 1st beer was empty to get offered a refill. I never did get the water I requested twice either."}, {"review_id": "6xMmzg0Nq0MHPlKD4jiRtw", "user_id": "QMv3G0xwD4u4me0_nWXTng", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "This place is SO GOOD. To start, I ordered the watermelon margarita - loved it. My table also split the cheese fondue appetizer. The bread could have been better quality (more than just a cut up hamburger bun) but the steak and apple slices were perfect with the cheese. For dinner I ordered the tacos al pastor and they were delicious! Very filling as well! They have a great selection of beers here, along with a good wine list and can make anything at the bar. There was live music when I was there and we were able to hang out on the patio at our table and listen. I would definitely go back to this place!"}, {"review_id": "ycW54ee6fbVTJTb4CXi1XA", "user_id": "NpoKkt9hhHpzOK_ZJ46QUg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/12/2018", "text": "Their food is meh but they make an AWESOME margarita and the staff are super friendly.

Beautiful building. Awesome decor inside. On a scale of 1 to 10 as far as service goes; I give it a 6. Not the most attentive of individuals. When i arrived they were not busy, yet there was a wait at the front door with people who simple wanted to be seated. Waiters simply walked by. When I did get a seat another lengthy wait before being greeted and asked what we were having to drink. As far as the food. I'll give it an 8 out of 10. The tempura shrimp appetizer was amazing. Nothing says loving like bacon wrapped tempura shrimp! The Hatch green chile pasta alfredo was extremely flavorful; and it's a very large portion dish. I had a sirloin that was cooked perfectly. Will i go back? Yes."}, {"review_id": "Y0XSVGb9f_3tg5qcFlSlJQ", "user_id": "7D1PhLZtvkWTVafyc7T7fw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "The food was great, had the Prime Rib on Saturday evening.
