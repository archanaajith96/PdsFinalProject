The place's atmosphere is super chill and the music is always great. I just wish this branch was a little bigger like their branch in Hackensack but in a good weather, there are more seats and table available outside. The workers are super friendly they always make sure that your whole experience there is 10/10. There is always sauce available specially the white one. The most important thing of all, they always make sure that every table is clean and the garbage is never full. Since Halal Guys opened up near by I thought the place would lose customers but I still prefer the flavor of the meat and the texture of the rice and the softness of the pita bread. They live up to their name in terms of the flavor of the food and I love it!Definetly THE BEST Halal platter in NJ and NYC"}, {"review_id": "N8I-CdT_OIMIURfz6Phq7Q", "user_id": "Y1_HMZ0-FECxo9Y1B1-qjg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "3 Main items you can order. Platters - For when you're really really hungryWraps - For when you're not that hungryWings - For anytime you're just craving wingsYou add 'Color'(add-ins) to your liking. They also have sides like fries and falafel bites. The Platter. It's the staple. It's the flagship product. There are so many customizable options to The Platter (over rice/salad, green blast, etc.). There's literally a platter option for all diets! -Personally, I always get a mixed platter over rice with falafel. The Wrap. It's a Platter but wrapped.... just not as much food goes into a wrap as a platter. It's satisfying for when you're not hungry but you know you should eat. I don't get it often because I'm usually really bad at portion control. The Wings. These are easily some of my favorite wings. They are super juicy(pun intended) and crispy(breaded). The sauces are really good and full of flavor. They're also not on the menu so if you know, you know. The sauces I always get are Honey BBQ and Mild&Garlic. 1 order comes with 6 wings. They make them to order so the second you order, you hear them shout, 'Drop __ wings!' (Same with the falafel). Great place to hangout at because they're open late.My motto: the later it gets, the more delicious Juicy Platters is."}, {"review_id": "4hR5a_MEagBjFN78a6YDkA", "user_id": "mtx27_uIUZ6lssI_oBeRWA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/23/2018", "text": "Juicy is our personal favorite for when you want to grab a fast healthy option for great value. The food is made cook-to-order so you know you're getting freshest of ingredients. We enjoy getting the salads with a mix of chicken and beef. Obviously you need to get to works if you're trying this for the first time; aka try the falafel, the plantains, the spiced chickpeas. If you're trying to eat clean, they have an option called the \"green blast\" which is comprised of spinach and broccoli. They make veggies tolerable! Also, do we need to mention that you NEED to add the spicy sauce and the white sauce? It's a requirement! You will not be disappointed."}, {"review_id": "uxyKcIqOFOo8dB6JoS8elA", "user_id": "AqR9SsmS6ehOnWV4-gO68Q", "rating": 4.0, "date": "11/21/2017", "text": "Juicy Platters is my all time new favorite platter spot, especially if you're a vegetarian--it's often hard to find a platter place with good falafels but everything is good here and reasonably priced as well. I usually get the Falafel Platter (Falafels, Basmati Rice, Tahini, Salad, Pita and Onions) ($7.94). If you're not too hungry, one platter is big enough to share or save for later. Their fries are also very tasty, especially with some with white sauce and hot sauce drizzles over them. The best part about Juicy Platters is that you can have as much of the delicious white sauce, hot sauce and BBQ sauce as you'd like! The bottles are kept refrigerated on the side and you drench your meal in sauce or use small containers to take it to go. If you'd like, they even have a small bottle you can purchase for a couple bucks if you'd like, but I usually find I am content with what I can drizzle on top of my meal. I've already visited Juicy Platters several times in the last couple months and like to stop by whenever I'm in the Bergen County area."}, {"review_id": "0DdTw5ydsx3ni2b8UrT0bg", "user_id": "tZVeJsXoIAiAyCje4Y8xMQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/7/2018", "text": "The food was really good.

This place handled my carnivore cravings quite well. I was steered here by a coworker and I have to say, it lived up to his hype. Prices are good, food is fresh, and it's a great approach to service. Fast-food delivery of freshly cooked meals.  The Mix platter was enough for two people. Loved their tahini.   My daughter loved the gyro. They offer good vegetarian options for my friends who aren't carnivorous. This is a great lunch place in Fair Lawn, and I like that they're open late as well.

They have recently incorporated salad bowls and wraps as a part of their menu which is so much healthier. I love adding the green blast to my food to get that extra serving of vegetables. And when I want to eat unhealthy, I normally get the wings which are amazing. I love the honey barbeque the most.Best things about juicy? They are HALAL, zabihah halal.

It's not quite the same but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The price is fair and the serving size is comparable to Halal Guys. The white sauce is still extremely delicious and the hot sauce definitely isn't made with hellfire like 53rd & 6th's (again not necessarily a bad thing). They serve other food as well, but the place is called Juicy PLATTERS, you know what to get. They're open very late, especially considering they're in the suburbs which gives them bonus points. Mind you a Halal Guys has recently opened up not too far from Juicy Platters but I have yet to pay them a visit.

Recently came here for lunch with a friend. We are in. They don't have a large seating area inside, and when the weather is nice, they do have some seating outside. You can order a platter, salad, or pita with chicken, gyro, falafel, or a mix of chicken and gyro. They'll ask if you want all the toppings and are willing to take off anything you don't want. They also offer some premium toppings, like kale and plantains, for an additional cost.I had a chicken pita, and my friend had a chicken platter. The portions didn't disappoint, and the seasoning was nice. They have white sauce and hot sauce.

The saffron rice with the cumin spices is perfect, the caramelized onions melt in your mouth, the chicken and beef gyro are marinated perfectly straight from the grill, the pita is perfect, and the salad is solid.

Trust me...it's worth it. Juicy Platters offers an alternative for the Chipotle generation....halal style. Simple, made to order, and delicious!The platters offer a generous serving of delicious halal meat. Both times I've ordered the chicken/beef mix. It is to die for. The white sauce and spicy red sauce are also highly recommended if you'd like to elevate your platter. On our most recent visit I added fried plantains, guacamole and tomato to my platter. Not only did it Not desecrate this heavenly dish, it enhancing the gastronomical experience. If you're anywhere within a 20 mile radius.

I go to both and you simply can't say one is \"better\" than the other.Menu is straightforward and staff is helpful & friendly. You can see the kitchen and what's going on: the fast service and what kind of care goes into making your delicious platter! Don't forget to ask for a loyalty punch card to earn towards a free platter, and to check Yelp for any check-in offers!Plenty of sauces available by the bottle, or dispense it into containers to go. I always get a mix platter over rice & salad. The pita is great. I haven't tried adding anything else and I probably won't. Gonna stick with what I already love!
