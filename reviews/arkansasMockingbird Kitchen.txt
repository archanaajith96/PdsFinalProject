The food is amazing. This is a chef owned restaurant and it shows.  Each dish is carefully designed to provide an experience and the chef's sincerity is in every bite. Carefully prepared, the food is fresh, healthy and well presented.  I find the menu choices to be creative and inspired.  I love how the menu changes seasonally as well as flows with the chef's inspirations.  It feels like I have a personal chef preparing meals just for me. Don't skip the mockingbird pie. It's a wonderful, not too sweet end and wraps up the experience with the warmth and love that Mocking Bird delivers with every bite"}, {"review_id": "qsXwBFIZCcddoyN2zicVKQ", "user_id": "ACBE8_j6p-6gunapo_YSDg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/10/2018", "text": "This was our first time eating here. The meatballs, cheese curds and kale salad were excellent.We had the fried chicken which was amazing. The fish and grits was not. The fish was so over spiced it was hard to eat. The shrimp tacos also were very bland. The pimento burger was good but impossible to eat as a burger. It was so juicy and saucy the bun got super soggy and fell apart. The sage maple whiskey sour and  the grapefruit gin drink was really really good. The cocktails would be much better if they used better ice that did not melt and water down the drink. The service was okay, not great. We would come back again."}, {"review_id": "aNC0dThYZi00XtO7dXUs-Q", "user_id": "FDQpUh4pC3PAP9rfRuaXmQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/7/2018", "text": "Mockingbird Kitchen is tucked in the corner of the nondescript Evelyn Hills shopping center. I'd been stalking their Instagram feed, so I figured it was time to stop in and check it out. So glad we did!After a short wait and lovely conversation with the hostess, we were seated near the kitchen and perused our menus. $3 mimosas? Heck yeah! Signed myself up for that (see proud photo). Ironically, it was between the veggie burger and the meatloaf. I chose the veggie burger. If you think it won't get you full, you'd be wrong. It was huge and filling; I couldn't finish it. The flavor was divine and the smashed sweet potatoes were really good, too.The hubs had the biscuits and with (bacon) gravy. He said they were nothing to write home about, but he did like them. From the looks of other reviews, we need to go back and try that pie! Definitely recommend. Mockingbird Kitchen won't disappoint."}, {"review_id": "k1AF89rikQTMb2pr1gMZLQ", "user_id": "Ckcwv2f9XXXJCwV2MRhV2Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "I was skeptical as I walked into this place tucked into the corner of a non descript strip mall.

I've heard many wonderful things about the food here for brunch, lunch and dinner. The inside of the restaurant is pretty plain, but the great menu makes up for that. Lots of great drink options for brunch from a Bloody Mary to a spiked ice coffee (with Tito's!) and a really great brunch menu. I had the tofu scramble and enjoyed it with salsa and housemade ketchup. Would totally come back for more!"}, {"review_id": "C-rBzqZuaWJDcCOIeibiKA", "user_id": "1dy8IOXaZ7Lz7mXf5tFOKQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/18/2018", "text": "\"Awesome\"!!!!Very good place great customer service food is delicious specials are great always a place to sit even when they're busy will recommend this to everybody"}, {"review_id": "U0jIF8s2K4tiq_8dI-jDNA", "user_id": "nVcDYhYwsgOTYi_TrW7plg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/6/2018", "text": "Nice spot, if you get to engage with management, she seems very engaged.

Saturday lunch menu was a fun group of starters, salads and sandwiches, and a few blue plates. We decided to have the buffalo cauliflower and read the preparation to be poached cauliflower then fried, and I presumed then dressed in the buffalo sauce, as you would do chicken. Instead, the fried florettes just had buffalo sauce on the side. Pretty disappointed - tossing them in the sauce in a hot skillet makes it stick; dipping just doesn't have the same effect. My BFF had a veggie burger on focaccia, and I will say the focaccia was probably some of the best I've ever had. It was light and soft and warm,  not that thick gut bombs of bread that I run across in airports.  I had the duck confit salad, which had soft sweet cheese, pears, pecans, etc. Pretty yummy stuff. Our waitress was sweet, and attentive enough, but just not very knowledgeable. We had to prompt to know what soup they were serving today, prompt another time to find out about specials, etc.  I would have expected by 11:30 on Saturday, they'd be ready for the day. Small concern. Had some fascinating sounding desserts and several selections of homemade ice cream, but couldn't find it in my diet today. Will make a point to go back and give that and some other items another try."}, {"review_id": "pI1kwISOu6Niaklph07_qw", "user_id": "ZzNH8FepkBeFip17xRlH5Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "We went to eat breakfast because we heard how good it was. 3 of us sat down and ordered and within the time of us getting our food 4 different groups had come in, sat down, ordered, ate, and left before we were given our food.

Yea I know that's meant for a crow and not a mockingbird. But it sounded right. This place is FABULOUS! This little nest is snuggled up in a shopping center and can be easily overlooked if you don't know where to look. (Look for Arcadia and its next door)Wait Staff is very pleasant and friendly. The ambiance is very nice and easy going. When we showed up there was 4 tables of older ladies having their brunch. Just to give you an idea of the atmosphere. The food is very 'organic'. Great use of Fresh ingredients and perfect presentation. The food was very tasty. I really can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu.  I had the mockingbird burger and it was spot on delicious!"}, {"review_id": "n1xOqlcxA7XxJd2xvT8lyA", "user_id": "83rGkDzePgU0AcquRljjRQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/25/2018", "text": "Very under seasoned.

I have been wanting to eat here for a while and was excited to take my friends, who live in LR, while they were in town for Sunday brunch. Service: Our server was scattered- took 2 people to bring us sugar substitute; she had to search for a pen to take our orders & forgot our side of fruit (grapes & oranges) twice. Food: friend's waffle was nothing special. Server described the grits as \"creamy\". They were lumpy & flavorless even after we added cheese. Other friend ordered biscuits & gravy. Horrible. Server asked \"you want the peppered gravy right?\" which he agreed. Gravy had no pepper, was flavorless & the (one)biscuit halves were flat, sad, small, hard discs. We all even commented that the coffee tasted sour. My Eggs Benedict arrived without hollandaise sauce. I just gave up. On a side note, the owner read my review & apologized/acknowledged that they were not prepared for the volume of business on this particular day."}, {"review_id": "LQqpNtV2TsZ8kGFv-WIvAg", "user_id": "M0N-ELQAiCbz6J3Ex5NslQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Wow.
