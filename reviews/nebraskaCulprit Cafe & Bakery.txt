I am never not in the mood for espresso and pastries, so I decided we were going to Culprit. For food, we ordered the whole egg sandwich with bacon, a Boston creme doughnut, and a beignet with house jam. I was being indecisive about my drink and saw one on the menu called \"the cool hand,\" which was described as espresso, milk, and flavor of the month (essentially a flavored latte). I asked the girl taking our order what the flavor of the month was, and she said that they didn't really have one at the moment but went on to explain that they make all their syrups in house. She rattled off a list that I don't remember, but I ended up going with caramel. I'm pretty sure this is the best caramel latte I have ever had. Who cares about latte art when it tastes that good?Once our food came out, we started with the whole egg sandwich. We found the spongy shape and consistency (see pic) of the egg a bit strange, but as a whole, the sandwich was simple and tasty. The Boston creme was next, and its filling was fluffy, creamy, and just slightly sweet, though I do wish there had been more doughnut than filling. Last was the beignet, and though I have had fewer truly authentic beignets while living in the South than I'd like to admit, I thought this one was perfect, even with the added sweetness of the jam.My husband told me \"good choice\" when we left. That doesn't happen often. Thank you, Culprit, for a good first impression of Omaha."}, {"review_id": "sx0YMqAoKN-tVZV5BgRl8g", "user_id": "JC4GS8ekuSdqUdKZ17Z91g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "We were excited, the kids for the french toast my wife for quiche. i was open for anything.  order at the counter, prepay for everything, then get called up to pick up your drinks, then get called up to pick up your three orders of french toast and quiche, finally get to bus your own table when finished. why did i tip 20% on a $48 breakfast to do ALL the work myself?

The front end service left a little to be desired. My coffee was served out of a very sticky mug. I'm not sure if it was washed thoroughly.

The decor is really nice inside, full of food furniture, flowers in glass vases, and artfully placed copies of The New Yorker. There is ample seating, and a variety of it. However, the outlets are a little hidden, ask about that before you sit down if you'll be needing a charge.Culprit is known for being a bakery, and their bread supplies local restaurants such as Block 16, Nite Owl, and Avoli Osteria. They also feature a selection of pastries and sweets. During my first visit, on a weekday, they had two varieties of scones and a few types of donuts. When I went on Saturday, they had cinnamon rolls, scones, donuts, and fruit pastries. Their selection definitely varies by day, as does their coffee cocktails, think Spiked Chai, Mimosas, and Spanish Coffee. My first visit, I had the Cherry Almond scone and the plain quick press coffee. I'm not a coffee expert, but I definitely like Culprit's coffee. Its not too bitter and it didn't make me cringe when I downed the last of the mug that had grown cold (am I the only one who does that?) The scone was so good, the texture was amazing. A little crunchy on the outside with the hard bake and the sugar and so soft on the inside I thought it was raw. Don't worry, it wasn't! The flavor of the almond essence overpowered the actual pieces of cherry but it was still good. Onto my *magical* second visit. This time we went on a Saturday and it was poppin'! The shop was busy and we were hungry. They have a Breakfast and Lunch menu on the board, so we ordered from both. My friend got the pork belly Banh Mí with pickled onions, sriracha, and cilantro on ciabatta. His review is, \"tasty!\" I tried a little and I enjoyed it as well. He also had the slow pour, which was awesome, no bitterness at all with a smooth flavor. I had the cinnamon roll and a bowl of soup, which is on rotation every week. I received the cinnamon roll first, and since I was hungry I took a bit. OH. MY. GOD. This was, hands down, the best cinnamon roll i've ever had in my life. Ot was flaky and buttery, with a healthy amount of cinnamon and a generous portion of thick cream cheese frosting spread on top. As I took more bites, the frosting oozed down and mixed with the cinnamon. I want that cinnamon roll to be my last meal. I want to die inside a giant tub of those cinnamon rolls. It was absolutely amazing. The kitchen was really busy, and I still hadn't been given my soup. After all, I didn't want to eat the entire cinnamon roll before my meal! I went to a waiter and checked up on it, and shortly thereafter I was brought my Roasted Red Pepper soup. This was so yummy! It was made of pureed red peppers topped with red onions and chives with a drizzle of olive oil. I do wish I had gotten it with the toast (that's the regular option) because there wasn't much variety in the texture, it needed crackers or something crunchy. Slurp slurp. Overall, I really enjoy Culprit Cafe, I wish I would have found it sooner. The staff I interacted with were really helpful, and the vibes are really flexible.  Quiet study spot in the morning and bustling cafe in the lunchtime. Their hours are limited but its worth a visit when they're open. If anything, please call ahead and see if they have the cinnamon roll, because it will change your life, my promise."}, {"review_id": "CKNeeMENA1cxXduiYFL2vg", "user_id": "9OLYxHqxVVdIvEitnV2Q5Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "Amazing breakfast sandwich probably the best I've ever had.  If I'm ever in Omaha again I'll make a point of coming back!"}, {"review_id": "DkH7ilM7XEOuAL_5BTxJow", "user_id": "XzLpeFAC9ckBZO-5vGnY-w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/24/2018", "text": "A very cute bakery with delicious foods.

They had customers but were not full. The pastries were very creative and pretty. They included a Creme Brûlée donuts, Blueberry and mint scones, and Lemoncello donuts. Unfortunately the pastries looked better than they tasted. Maybe I was just craving sugar, but in all they were not that sweet. And their different ingredients did not stand up to the baking.

It was full but the service was fast. My friend had the Challah French Toast and I had the Whole Egg Sandwich with ham and a hot chocolate. I tasted the French toast and it was delicious. Fluffy and sweet- too sweet for me but that's why I don't order French toast! It was beautifully plated as well. My egg sandwich was good- the egg had a foamy texture, I can't explain it any other way! It could have used some seasoning. Not bad, just not excellent. And it wasn't plated with quite as much finesse as the French Toast- if you're going to make a point of plating some things artfully then you should be consistent with all of your dishes. My only real complaints are that my hot chocolate came out several minutes after our food did and wasn't particularly hot and there weren't any clean tables to sit at. HOWEVER, it was a busy Saturday morning!

Be forewarned that it does get packed on weekends so plan accordingly. Pay attention to portion sizes because it's a wait if you need to get back in line. I made that mistake ordering the beignet. I didn't realize it was a single beignet and not a full order.That said, the beignets are cheap and large but you'll want to oder more than one if you're looking for a meal. I tried the jam and Nutella varieties and both were delicious. You really can't go wrong with either.My husband ordered the french toast which I sampled and loved. The rosemary maple syrup is certainly special.The cinnamon bun is delicious as everyone makes it out to be. I got one for my ride back to Iowa and was delighted by the buttery and flaky pastry.
