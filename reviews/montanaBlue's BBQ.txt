I cannot drive by without smelling the smoke from Main Street. Its like the pied piper is pulling me in. Amazing slow smoked ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and turkey. House made sides and homemade BBQ sauces. I've had a lot of BBQ across America and this place is my go to. Blues doesn't set the bar, they are the bar."}, {"review_id": "0pV68Icfa02teF_brNJBwQ", "user_id": "1sFjPBt4fE_zPWngghtwHg", "rating": 1.0, "date": "9/8/2017", "text": "As popular as this place is, I don't eat anything from them anymore.

Saw that it was connected to a gas station and had a drive thru and almost drove away. It is Definitely a hole in the wall type restaurant but it was busy and we were starving. Ribs were just pulled from the smoker outside and brought in full racks. They were juicy and had great flavor. The brisket sandwich was delicious as well. The beans were delicious and the coleslaw was coleslaw. The BBQ sauce was a little lacking in flavor and the HOT sauce didn't have any kick. Don't regret the stop at all."}, {"review_id": "qDjqEYM2NefVbvohiA6kyQ", "user_id": "bevAcMcU3eP5LSCJ7oRzHw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "7/26/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Poor service. ,Don't DARE TRY SIDES.

They say world famous, and I'm not sure about that, but they are darn tasty. Just the right amount of smoke flavor, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. The sides (I had potato salad and coleslaw) were pretty good, but the ribs are where it's at! A coworker who I ate with had the brisket sandwich, which he said was good, but he ate one rib and said next time he's getting ribs. The prices are fair and the food is ready almost before you're done ordering (they even have a drive through). Probably the best meal I've had on this end of Billings. Don't let the fact that this place is in a gas station deter you!"}, {"review_id": "BflMoZqy8caUh0nEG4PwXQ", "user_id": "w2dABjiM6x2j6AmvMkv6eA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/1/2017", "text": "My husband loves this place!

Definitely get the spicy sausage, it's got the perfect amount of kick to it. Really enjoyed it! My favorite part of my meal for sure.Ribs were very succulent and only really needed a little sauce. Very good!Brisket was a little dry but their BBQ sauce is really good (a little on the sweet side, even the hot), so a little bit of sauce and the brisket was excellent.Baked yam was good and comes with brown sugar and butter on the side. Baked beans were okay.As everyone mentioned, it is in a gas station. It's basically inside the convenience store of the gas station. You can eat inside or they have a drive thru for take out.Super friendly and great service! Definitely recommend for BBQ in Billings."}, {"review_id": "FTYhG7hj493ZysYWVtZRgg", "user_id": "GmfbRFCSaLaab_TjwJZKQw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/17/2017", "text": "I love Blues.
