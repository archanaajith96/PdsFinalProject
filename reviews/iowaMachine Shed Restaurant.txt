She mentioned this place before, as it had been around for awhile. It reminded me of a train-inspired Cracker Barrel. There is a storefront, where you can buy nick-knacks, and old candy, but in the back is the restaurant, which is complete with mason jar water glasses. I had the \"Plowman's Favorite,\" which is corned beef hash and eggs. It was canned hash, but still cooked well. My eggs were delicious and runny, and I had the home fries, which are slices of potatoes that are cooked to a crisp. My breakfast also came with a side of biscuits and gravy, which I only had a sampling off, as I was full with all of the food on my plate! Overall, the food was your basic breakfast fare; it was satisfying, but nothing outstanding. The only downside to this place was the fact that there was only one waitress for the entire room, so it took awhile for us to get our food. She was kind the whole time, and we definitely didn't blame her! I would come back here again, and next time I would check out the front-end shop some more!"}, {"review_id": "V6ul3TcBQOwW-ijjOCfFRw", "user_id": "Xa0f7rPaPykJtE9f4JTJbw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/4/2017", "text": "A group of 12 ate here in Sunday, December 3, 2017.

I had the heartland combo which is three different pork selections one one plate. Don't worry, it comes with sides, and more sides. They asked me if I wanted cottage cheese, apple sauce or cole slaw with it... pick two of the three... they said. I chose the cole slaw and apple sauce. The cole slaw was good... but the apple sauce was... well... not exactly apple sauce... it was more like baked apples that you might get at some other restaurants... it was served cool, and more like apple pie filling... it was excellent! Oh, it also comes with white bread, corn bread and butter... Then came the main course...  the Heartland Combo... 1. Roasted Pork Loin ... stuffed with dressing and covered in gravy... yummy...2. The Heartland Delight which are pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon... imagine a pork bacon wrapped filet mignon... mouth watering...3. The Parmesan Crusted American Cut.  They actually do call this one the filet mignon of pork on the menu. It is charbroiled and served with mushroom wine sauce and Parmesan butter crust.  Image one of the best, juiciest pork chops (non battered) that you have ever had, then cover it with this yummy, cheesy, buttery, mushroom sauce with a terrific Parmesan crust... This was top notch! Oh, I about forgot to mention that it came with corn on the cob with the main dish...Overall, this was one of the best dinners that I have had in a long time. I also love the atmosphere. The waitresses wear bib overalls and it is decorated with old farming memorabilia. And your drinks come in Mason Jars...Oh, it is walking distance from the truck stops just the other side of I-80.  There were a couple truck drivers there that knew about this place and walked over from the truck stop. And the prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend this place if you are in the area around meal time..."}, {"review_id": "Wq5VrDziQG6j5DGaxFlXKQ", "user_id": "fplv5Y5_kS4Wj9a5BfJILA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/21/2018", "text": "The food was pretty good, customer service was the best thing about this place, I had all u can eat ribs and they were somewhat good the bbq sauce wasn't good at all.  Possible go back"}, {"review_id": "wWriIkq0g0iPZK7KAldbBQ", "user_id": "1xT4ODpLNWVqeoIfGE3RzQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/19/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Wait staff is wonderful Fried Chicken is the best around real mashed potatoes delicious snow peas we've been coming here for years and just love this place!"}, {"review_id": "WJNB3OIkJZPX1aS_Ahq5zA", "user_id": "gLzx7N5ZGE9sta47okQeAg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/25/2018", "text": "I ate the loaded potato soup, and had an apple dumpling. The soup was really good, and the apple dumpling with cinnamon ice cream was divine. I was a bit disappointed when we ordered, because I looked at the menu online prior to arriving and decided what I wanted. When I ordered I was told that had not been on the menu for a year or so. So I went to my second choice. I then ordered biscuits only to be told they didn't have biscuits. Shortly there after the waitress came by the table and informed me she was getting me biscuits. She did this because she felt bad that everything I ordered I was told they did not have. They only serve biscuits for breakfast. Good save on the part of the waitress. Our wait time was average and service was not intrusive. I will go back, next time I won't trust the online menu."}, {"review_id": "ve94c5J1GU08Us-2nzx9Gw", "user_id": "ttc3_AtKQzrFlFdfsS0-zg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/5/2017", "text": "First impression when I walked through the doors? Cracker Barrel.I don't know if there's a Cracker Barrel in the area but where I'm from, Ohio, we have Cracker Barrel's.I stopped here during lunch and it wasn't packed but I feel we had some pretty slow service here. Portions were pretty big except for mine but I always seem to get the short end of the straw. I ordered the BBQ beef brisket sandwich and wasn't impressed at all. It was edible but nothing special. One of my coworkers orders the lunch meatloaf and his plate was huge. It looked like a 2\" thick slice on top of a mountain of mashed potatoes. I was actually pretty jealous when compared to my little sandwich.Not much else to say but it's your typical restaurant."}, {"review_id": "PvW1Jyczo5vO_ZY8VxEocg", "user_id": "5QeFg1CIcgKl7CH7tir8eg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/26/2017", "text": "Really cool unique place to visit when you are visiting this area.

But, food is just one part of the equation. The restaurant operates understaffed, for as long as I can remember anyway. People wait 45 minutes for seating, even with several empty tables. Frequently people wait several minutes just to pay their bill.Once your food is served, there is a time sensitive component to people enjoying their food. When someone needs salt, gravy, jelly, etc... your host should be prompt. This too, rarely happens.For elderly people, the seats are hard. Frequently, when dining with family, we've had to leave immediately after eating because of someone's back hurting.Good food? Yes. Absolutely.Good dining experience? No. Sadly, this my last time at this home grown restaurant."}, {"review_id": "rDGVIj31f8QtbfIj8YwVlQ", "user_id": "4fQUAbubJrI9xvTBkm7J1g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "OMG first thoughts.  I LOVE IT!

We had 4 children with us that had grown pretty restless. However, the food was the shining star! The chicken, pork, and brisket were amazing. The bread, coleslaw, and spiced apples were divine. Was it worth the wait and the drive? I encourage you to answer that for yourself. Foodies will enjoy the meal but not necissarily the experience.

We've now been stopping here 2-4 times a year for the last 6 or 7 years. But I keep asking myself why, every time. It's certainly a neat looking place, with a farm-vibe, and neat-o gift shop. And the folks working there are always fast and friendly. But the food is always just okay. Always. I always end up asking myself the same 2 things: Why doesn't this place serve breakfast all day? I feel like they'd kill breakfast, but I'm never there in time for that. And, what does this place do better than a Perkins/Denny's/Village Inn? I mean, the food isn't anything special to me. It's alright, but why do we keep thinking we have to stop here? In fact, I actually think I like those chain places better, because they do serve breakfast all day. I think the answer keeps coming down to the atmosphere here. It really is neat, especially if you have kids who like farm stuff.

Somewhere we visited, it was great,and as time goes by the story grows grander and grander.     In our travels, my husband and I found and sampled the Iowa Machine Shed....once. it was more than a year and a half ago. We loved it, wanted to return, but not lucky enough to get there.       Finally we managed a return visit. My husband worried maybe time had made our heart grow fonder than the actual first visit. In a word, no. Our second visit was magnificent, a five plus....      Our server knew the menu. This is so important. If you cannot answer questions about the dish, you disappoint. If we make a request to change the dish, a less than knowledgeable server cannot help. She made our visit even better.      Portion size was great. There is a nice country themed gift shop. You get a complimentary choice of appetizers, the cooked apples served warm or cold are seasoned with lemon and orange zest. Awesome, a dessert treat! A fabulous find in the midwest. A jewel! One I would ravish to eat at weekly!!!!
