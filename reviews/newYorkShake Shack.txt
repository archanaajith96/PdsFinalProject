I have heard a lot of good things about this place, and of course it was something I had to do before I left the big apple. The line up was very long, but the staff handled each customer quickly - so, there was not much of a wait. You get buzzed when the food is ready which is an efficient way to keep everyone away from the lineup chaos.The classic cheeseburger was delicious, but I had high expectations which it did not live up to. It is your typical homemade burger, very different than other fast-food chains which I think that's why it's highly reputable. The fries were really good to pair with.Nonetheless, It's not the best burger I've ever had, but I would choose this spot over Mcdonald's any day & the food was really good!"}, {"review_id": "PznCPqDJXukR2G2OkB072Q", "user_id": "WmZ57am1XiKLkp9w7lkOZA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/5/2018", "text": "Shake Shack: The Slowest Fast Food EverGot on line at 8:26pm.

Look, I love Shake Shack, this was originally a one star review, and the food was tasty, but seriously. Not sure if this is a staffing issue, or an issue of the menu being too complicated or something, but this is a nightmare.

I would never go back to a restaurant if their burger was not at least this good. The bun is a potato bun which is a great choice, but everything else is not worth mentioning. There isn't anything wrong with it but there isn't anything good about it either. The shake was terrible because it had the consistency of heavy cream and wasn't frozen. I would rather have plain milk. The french fries on the other hand are the only thing I've ever wanted to go back for, and they aren't anything special...they're simply crinkle cut and crispy.Value - average, ~$11 for burger fries and shakeService - fast foodAtmosphere - casual / outdoorsFacility - the best thing about this place is that it is inside Madison Square ParkNeed to know - download the app and order ahead or be prepared to wait a long timeWould I come back - Yes but only if I was with someone and they wanted to goWould I go out of my way - NoAdditional info - There is so much hype around these burger it is crazy. The only place I have had a burger that wasn't better than this is at delis and other fast food joints like Mcdonalds. If you are accustom to in-n-out, the shakes are about the same but the burgers are a step down."}, {"review_id": "ps98QSeNWnTTqexj9G9zgw", "user_id": "XP5hqB6A9rvXlH_LHtzUgA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Shake Shack makes one damn delicious burger that rivals another popular chain on the opposite coast In-N-Out. But we're in the east coast and Shake Shack will do. I ordered a double shack burger, their Chick'n Shack and some fries. Their fries were tasty, their cheese burger tasted fresh and homemade. Just very simple lettuce and tomatoes with their Shacksauce, not gourmet bull crap, just some simple ingredients to make a damn tasty, juicy and meaty burger. Their Chick'n Shack tasted amazing as well. A crispy chicken breast with lettuce and their buttermilk herb mayo. The breast was very thick, perfectly fried and juicy chicken. Both items tasted great and would order both without hesitation. The fact that this place is in the middle of a park I Manhattan is still incredible to me. I didn't have to wait long for my food and once I received my order I was able to enjoy it outdoors in the cold fresh air. Pretty sure this burger has to taste better in the warmer months. I've seen Shack Shack in Vegas, but I've never had it prior to coming here. I also found out that we have some here in Illinois. Although I don't regret trying it in New York first, now that I know it's here locally I probably wouldn't come here again. Gotta be able to try some more food from other places while in NYC."}, {"review_id": "ByVyfjT91tYpR-gyMes6tw", "user_id": "VFYDy2839GEOq7bh8ntMYw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/4/2018", "text": "*** only judging the custard and not the burgers...Custard: 4/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Overall:  custard custard custard YES PLEASE!!!!  Such a shame that the custard calendar is gone.  The extended review...Custard:Pie Oh My concrete - pie à la mode deconstructed!  Very good combination.

The shakes are thick and compliment your choice of burger. Their burgers aren't thick like Five guys, much more similar to smash burger. Shake Shack has built up in the surrounding areas and has many more locations then it used too.

It's grilled to perfection with a toasted potato bun, bacon, cheese and peppers, not spicy at all just very flavorful. Also the fries are so simple but, delicious, add extra cheese and bacon for more flavor! Drinks: Beer, WINE, shakes, and soda .Ambiance: Always busy but that's because it's so good.

All the seating is outdoors. On sunny days it's a great place to enjoy your burger and people/dog watch. Shack Stack is the way to go! It's a cheeseburger with the deep fried Portobello mushroom. The patty is juicy and delicious as is but adding the Portobello mushroom in it makes it THAT much better. They also have the shroom burger which is the vegetarian version. Shake shack fries are crinkle cut so if you're from the west coast like me you might prefer In N Out fries over Shake Shack's. The soft serve is a must here! Pro tip: there's a separate line for just dessert so you can hop into that short line to get your soft serve after you eat your burger and fries."}, {"review_id": "oUXui9JY0Q7v1mQcW4y11w", "user_id": "3byRUpH3xAb55j43UHAp9A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/26/2018", "text": "Long time visitor to Shake Shack, but first time reviewer. I remember in the past when this was the only Shake Shack location in NY and the lines were ridiculous! You might still get stuck on a long line on a warm day, but things are definitely a bit different now with so many more brick and mortar locations.My go to is always the Shack Stack. Best of both worlds when you're unsure if you want a cheese burger or the shroom burger. This is extremely filling, but might as well get that side of fries and a shake while you're at it! Terrible idea to get this for a lunch break if you're in the area.

Yes, it is the original location and yes it is fun to eat in Madison square park. However, if you do not care about either of those things, then I suggest you try a different location.

Often described as the East Coast's In-N-Out Burger, they offer a solid selection of your typical fast food, ranging from burgers to hot dogs, shakes to fries, and everything in between.While I'm indifferent about their burgers, I am quite a fan of the Chick'n Shack. I really like how the chicken breast is sufficiently moist inside, yet pleasantly crispy outside. The buttermilk herb mayo and the pickle that come on the sandwich add a burst of flavor. I thought the potato buns were tasty, but due to its soft texture, it became a big mush each time I took a bite.The fries are also pretty good - fried to golden brown, crispy perfection. When I ordered the Bacon Cheese Fries, I thought it was odd that they gave us the cheese and the bacon in separate containers for us to assemble, instead of putting it together for us. As a result, I felt that the amount of cheese that they provided us wasn't sufficient enough. Nonetheless, I thought the cheese was tasty; if I order this again, I will make sure to specify that I prefer my cheese fries assembled, rather than receiving the DIY version.If you must get the full experience at this original, flagship location, then be prepared to wait. However, if you simply want your food, then consider visiting one of the other locations that are scattered throughout Manhattan."}, {"review_id": "S83TBLoEPowaIWKN1iDfTw", "user_id": "dxUhjUbLs5IZkn1V37Kp4A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "10/21/2017", "text": "So we should have had the hamburger and a shake.

Unadorned plain in its bun it looked rather sad so I added some mustard and ketchup from the condiments. Tasted fine but not sure I'd order again. Nice to know they have other options for non beef eaters though. His Chicago style dog had all the fixings and was a mouthful. He seemed to like it.
