The owner stopped by our table, he was very kind and I appreciated his stopping by.Fresh, flavorful, creative and delicious.

The Godzilla roll is a serious dream. It has tuna, banana, masago, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. The combination is to die for.Baba is quite small but they have a back patio area that is open and airy. Every server I have had is nice and quick. The last time we were there, an item was missing from our order and the server was able to get us the item very quickly (thank you to the chefs as well)."}, {"review_id": "FMwlN4mphDnLGTOT5w9IpA", "user_id": "dCnxB2z1p8EqfM8jkaa-vw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "It's been years since we dined at Baba. The day was cold and we stopped in for lunch. The place was empty. Our server was sweet and helpful. It was freezing inside due to deliveries and an open door and later, sweltering heat. Also, Fox News was on...ugh...sorry, Trump lovers.  That was a distraction from my vantage point. Sushi was great. Hot tea was nice. No lunch specials, a bummer. Dinner pricing mid day kinda sucked. 100 or so with tip. $$$$. Weird seating and setting..too dark, too cramped."}, {"review_id": "sYAgg0lBxITp9VjBNeHU5A", "user_id": "RMeYk-0-jKpCezl3TItk8w", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Small, but cute and amazing food!

We went tonight. We had a reservation. Arrived early. We sat in the back on the patio. Since there were a bunch of open tables, I asked not to sit in the middle of the room. Person sitting is gave us a serious attitude (again, there were many open tables).  Service was slow. Waitress apologized for slow service. (People who sat after us ate dinner & left before us.) Our order was messed up (I ordered sashimi, got sushi). After I pointed it out, waitress apologized and brought our sashimi after another long wait. Then she charged us for BOTH. I asked her to remove sushi charge from bill. I've worked in food service & understand things happen, but she didn't even offer anything. A free drink, free app, anything. She didn't even refill water without being asked. Don't think we'll return for a while. It wasn't worth the high price. I will say atmosphere was nice."}, {"review_id": "LDqDTINz9DW9UwZg7kAvRg", "user_id": "U-PjJEucEyzddhU9hEdouw", "rating": 2.0, "date": "1/5/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Ok, so here's a newsflash: do not sit in the back room on a cold night! The food here is quite good, the physical set up is where things get very dicey! They rely upon heaters which are situated above you in the back room, there is this very interesting physical  dichotomy where your upper body is almost uncomfortably warm while your feet are feeezing. It is a real issue and it seriously affects the dining experience.There is also the fact that these heaters are apparently gas fueled and they have an odor, not overpowering but still there. They also make a hissing sound when they are firing up! The food is very good but it's not worth it if you're physically uncomfortable"}, {"review_id": "miLbGs8kr0od9LsDxzSUBg", "user_id": "j1bftuYeNE7Bkj8jg5Nfww", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/1/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Sushi just okay.

Went to Baba with a friend for lunch on a Sunday. We had a reservation and were seated right away. We actually had a choice of what table we wanted. The restaurant was small but not cramped. The only issue I had with the space was that it was swarming with fruit flies! My friend and I were swatting them for hours - extremely irritating. We had the calamari which was tasty. I was not in the mood for sushi so I had the chicken teriyaki entree. It was ok. The teriyaki is different, more of a tomato base? I didn't hate it but not sure I liked it. My friend had a few maki rolls and they were fresh and tasty. We split a coconut ice cream and it was delicious! For drinks I had a cocktail which was ok but on the strong side, and then we had wine.Service was ok but a bit slow. We do like to gab a bit but I felt like we waited too much time with empty cups or a delay to order more food."}, {"review_id": "q1xj3FyP-QNMFNjr6rI89Q", "user_id": "gX7gRARDJ5ua2mOu1sCMvw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/24/2018", "text": "This is the best sushi you can get in Worcester no doubt but the service isn't top notch, my girlfriend and I at the entrance waiting to be seated for 7 minutes when they weren't busy, not to mention one of the waitresses just sat there starred at us and did nothing.

I  ordered otoro sashimi style and it came out brown. Tried to consume it and it was chewy and gross. This was not a good cut. (See attached picture). Pretty pathetic that this place serve high end fatty tuna sushi at this quality. Service was piss poor too. My water was empty for quite some time. They only have about 6 tables as I could see in the whole place. Had to call the manager over to tell them about the trash otoro they tried serving me. They were confused when I told them the otoro was a bad cut and shouldn't be brown or chewy. They then took it off the bill and gave me another fresh cut on them. was still trash. The maki rolls were pretty good though. Pretty sad this place is considered the best sushi spot in Worcester. I mean it is Worcester so what should I have expected here.... if you want to eat good sushi go to boston at oishii, pabu, or uni. Top 3 spots in the state for clean sushi. Wouldn't ever go back here again. I don't usually make reviews either on yelp just wanted to share my experience with this place. If you're a sushi noob you'll probably like it though. Maybe they just had a bad cut of otoro that day or something.

I asked for a table in the corner, out of the way.. It was a 4 top... Told we couldn't sit there in case a large party came in...

We ordered Godzilla, Angel Maki, and Sushi Sandwich.They were all fresh and tasty, and certainly interesting. And for non-sushi lovers, they do offer other dishes, such as Ginger Chicken. It was thin but large filet of chicken, lightly fried. It didn't have much flavor on its own, the ginger sauce that came with it was necessary to enhance the flavor of the chicken. But, I have to say, it is a \"sushi restaurant\" so if you want to order something other than sushi, it might not be as great as the sushi that they offer...Overall, we were happy with the sushi, it was fresh, tasty, and interesting. The service was fast and efficient. They have many other interesting and unique sushi here, I would love to try some more in the future."}, {"review_id": "czGgsJTqnWhJqafIOeZiGQ", "user_id": "9ZjhOu2tvsvplRA3TBB2AQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/27/2017", "text": "I give 4 stars particularly for their oyster shooters being 5 to me.
