When we have family over I order this scramble and for less than $20 I can feed 10 - 12 people. We make either breakfast tacos or burritos with this huge tray of food.  Sometimes I fry a couple pounds of chorizo and mix it in.  You can't find a deal like this anywhere... The restraunt is super small and packed everytime I've stopped in to grab this scramble to go. The waitresses are super sweet. Cool little place..."}, {"review_id": "gj_GAQDx38dYyfcIGragRA", "user_id": "dvsMjUdVv-ECaxAzCQ7zxw", "rating": 1.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I was really excited for this place after reading so many great reviews and decided to take a friend , who was visiting me, here. My very first impression was not good as they are cash only and I am never the person who carries cash of more than 10 to 20 dollars. They have an atm installed in the place which charged me 3 dollars to take out cash with my Chase visa debit. How about accepting cards? I am sorry but I do not understand businesses who do not want to keep up with new payment options.After this, I think I made a bad choice by ordering fried chicken with waffles, my friend ordered special omelette with pancakes. My fried chicken was too dry and had bones which I am not a fan of. The waffles were just okay. The quantity is too much for one person. The pancakes were too thick and not so great. My friend did not like the omelette either. I kept wondering what people found so great with the place. The service was good but the cash only and the food part did not impress me and I do not think I can recommended this place to anyone."}, {"review_id": "0jI8ZC7_vAgMBiycRompnA", "user_id": "cTZnLROPj9ogLh0dzsRfow", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/23/2018", "text": "Great prices when you consider the portion sizes.

Don't judge a book my it's cover because is the greatest breakfast I have ever had. You can literally just eat the gravy it's so good.

The portions are amazingly huge so share a meal and get all the yummy add ins to the sides!!! Hash browns with the works was awesome. Almost a meal on its own stuffed waffles with berries are coma inducing and i couldn't put my fork down! CFS was perfectly crispy, eggs over medium perfectly cooked! Great meals.

The place is small, maybe 11 tables and booths with room at the counter for about 9. They are strictly cash only. Portions are generous; I always ask for half of a portion of hash browns. Their fruit plate is expensive but incredible; only fresh fruit and plenty of it. Service is good with just the right amount of attentiveness. The hot chocolate is served with a mountain of whipped cream and sprinkles. I'm never disappointed when I come."}, {"review_id": "dfP_kXX3ydhgbnoMK3xMfw", "user_id": "Lo4J4SPNCNFpAWFl6g0Msg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Huge portions lol!!!

I am so glad we stopped here! When we got there the line was a little long but you know it's good when people are standing out of the door at this little restaurant. As you enter their is no sitting area inside but while you are standing in line and waiting watching peoples orders come up and you're so hungry you cannot figure out what to order. Where to start? oh with a cup of coffee and a HOT COCOA yes to the whip cream it's delicious! we went for it and ordered the huge omelette WOE 5 people can finish this but we end up taking the rest To Go on the plane ride back to California. Pancakes are nice and fluffy so delicious , I ordered  1/2 hamburger steak and one over egg, brown gravy to make it a loco coco and add home fries OH SO GOOD! we will definitely return for sure and bring the rest of our family with us. Nice comfort food and GOOD FOOD! Huge Portions ! and the wait staff quick and great!Thank You"}, {"review_id": "24Sx-nMcI8V2BmqCjkuAPQ", "user_id": "LS7BDNctLhFuezOXEr32TA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/21/2018", "text": "Went with in-laws and hubby. Great place. Best places are always dive diners. Dont expect any the fancy frills. But the food is nothing but amazing. Wait staff were kind and kept my coffee/water filled. It has more than just breakfast to choose from. Affordable and worth the drive. Not a lot of outside parking or room inside. CASH ONLY. It does have an ATM inside. Bring an appetite since portions are large and we took most of in a doggie bag.

The food isn't the same quality, definitely not the same chef, very slow to come out, forgot part of our order, and higher prices. The final straw was the foul odor of natural gas that made my asthmatic kid sick, but I was told it is no big deal \"the gas range just does that sometimes.\" If your gas range leaks large amounts into the dining area there is a problem.
