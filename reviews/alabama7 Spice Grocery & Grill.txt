Appetizer: Dip Mix, one of these can easily serve five people as an appetizer and it allow you to try a couple different dips. It comes with fluffy pita bread and is super good.Entree: I got the Moussaka, which came with lentil soup. The soup is extremely thick and wonderfully seasoned. The soup serving was so large that I was almost full afterwards! This dish is eggplant with potatoes and meat. It almost looks like eggplant parm, but has Mediterranean seasoning. At first glance the prices might seem a little much, but the portions are huge!! I barely ate half of my food and had a lot of leftovers."}, {"review_id": "nmJ6D926ejbejneDVDOVmA", "user_id": "TLRlAcSlpKkhGvP2nq7w6A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "AMAZING. Food so good, I forgot I was in the south. The outward appearance is unassuming. I thought it would be a hole in the wall with the possibility of good food. I was so mistaken.The building extends way back and more than makes up for the narrowness of it.  They also did an excellent job arranging the store in the front half. They have a huge variety of products for sale here. I didn't have time to explore this much, but what I saw in passing looked great. You walk through the store to get to the restaurant at the back where there's a chalkboard sign directing you to wait to be seated. Lots of friendly staff here and we were seated immediately during the lunch hour. Service was fast, even though this place was hopping. Our server suggested we order the vegetarian platter as opposed to the vegetarian sampler. It's a much better deal for $2 more. You can take the extra food home with you, if you have any. This will be our only chance to eat here so we tried as much food as possible. The batata harra potatoes were super delicious with just a hint of spice. The citrus vinaigrette on the side salad was absolutely amazing and full of flavour. The baba ganoush was probably my favourite thing. He hummus was amazingly creamy. So glad we decided to give this place a try!"}, {"review_id": "rARkZKB85aW95zaRCZcrow", "user_id": "lYF9p0iGJqEvAZGZ6B3xUg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "The food is amazing and the staff is super friendly and helpful!

To drink I tried the Lebanese iced tea which was definitely different but very refreshing - tasted like some mint infused tea. Service was great.   Overall we definitely enjoyed our meal.  I highly recommend it."}, {"review_id": "tysBWFeJcXPFJfdQUVPfSA", "user_id": "sMBrZWGc58laco1b9S7ijQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/8/2018", "text": "Very interesting Middle Eastern market in the front that had reasonable prices and a big selection of items in the back there was a restaurant with friendly people a good cook that it both of the soups lentil and carrot were delicious and the meal lamb flaky pastry thing was very good just kind of small portion but everything was very done well and we would definitely go back again and at the Lena was a great waitress"}, {"review_id": "nJtwsY_H91hu954KiEbOvg", "user_id": "-RFX6k2bJFJZU7IlZoAMIg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/3/2017", "text": "This place is legit! Best Mediterranean food I've had in a while. I'd highly recommend the three dip sampler as a starter - and good luck trying to pick which one is best. Their carrot soup is phenomenal.  If you've managed to save room for your entree, you can't go wrong with any of their pastries, although the lamb one is particularly well spiced. So. Good. That being said, we almost didn't make it into the restaurant because we couldn't stop browsing in the grocery section. Between the dates, spices, fresh pitas, grains, cheeses, yogurts, etc., this place has so many of the things an adventurous cook needs. An absolute gem of a restaurant and grocery store!"}, {"review_id": "Gaf1HnPFvLl6qJlxux91uQ", "user_id": "qV0aNbii_WXjm0r7wuRMjA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/17/2017", "text": "My wife and I ate here for lunch today. This place is cool! It's tucked away in the back of an international grocery store. The ambiance is cozy and even a bit romantic. I ordered the Lula kebab entree with lentil soup and grilled veggies, and she had the gyro sandwich with fries and a side salad. We both had the Lebanese iced tea to drink. Overall, we both felt that the food was quite good, but not amazing. We each noted that our sides (veggies and fries) were under seasoned, and her salad was a tad light on dressing. That said, each of the mains was very tasty. In addition, my soup was incredible!  I quite liked the added crunch that the toasted pita croutons accompanying this side lent to it.We finished our meal with baklava for dessert. It was sweet, moist, and served warm. Talk about decadent!Another bright spot of our experience was the service. Our waitress was attentive and friendly, and the manager inquired of our experience and seemed sincerely interested in our response.In the end, we concluded that while 7Spice provided a pleasant and tasty dining experience for us today, it probably won't be one we'll drive an hour one-way again to have."}, {"review_id": "A7yoAyQrx90srnXgQ_CmeA", "user_id": "UfVXKcHVENF60Hnd3U8ROA", "rating": 1.0, "date": "3/22/2018", "text": "Overall waitress was nice but the food was pre cooked. I basically ate the french fires and half of my pastry because I was hungry. Veggies were not cooked properly either they had season on them but were not cooked. The pastry had curry seasoned chicken in it something no advertised on menu. I couldn't eat anymore of it. My coworker ordered the gyro entree and the meat was pre sliced thin with grill marks on the meat. The food wasn't my main issue how the manager handled my request was my problem. I ordered a Turkish coffee to try for the first time and I didn't like it. I suggested taking off the coffee and replacing it with a lentil soup. Manager said he couldn't do that but he would do something. Well he brought me back the bill and nothing was done. I paid my bill and left and I won't be returning or recommending anyone go there."}, {"review_id": "KE-Vpe-S8G0JU-1nnZdXZQ", "user_id": "Mys94HjR48K5fC1ZufCnxg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/25/2017", "text": "I never wrote a review in my life but it is the first time I am compelled to write one. Briefly stating, from outside it does not look much and when you enter you only see a grocery store. But there are two gems in the back of the store. A fairly decent looking and spacious restaurant with excellent choice of Greek/Arab food and an excellent service (Ask for COCO, she was awesome). On top of these the food tastes heavenly...perfectly done, large portions and there is more....The prices are so reasonable.Ah, where was this gem hiding for those years I have been visiting Mobile area. :)"}, {"review_id": "zuq_j2N98miNJ7WeEk4qlw", "user_id": "iH3y58KYrfRj-Hp0IsEglA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "10/23/2016", "text": "7 Spice is normally great. I would give this restaurant a 5 on a good day...today it was only a 2. It started with the manager taking our order, arriving at the table with a evening on the town quantity of cologne. A very nice person but be forewarned, I deduct 2 stars automatically if any of the staff are wearing strong fragrance. Once I feel my head closing up and a headache coming on the meal is ruined.The restaurant was busy and the service was very slow. The entree was served first followed by the soup and salad after we had finished. We didn't complain but simply had the balance of our meal boxed to go. Then began a 20 minute wait to get the check. I know this restaurant has a turnover problem in staff but one more experience like this and we are done...very disappointed.On the positive side the market has everything we need for middle eastern cooking."}, {"review_id": "QV5p3ulCmS4DHT9muZpJOw", "user_id": "t2JcJDaK3TDReax6GKcCeA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/24/2018", "text": "Amazing Greek and Arab food.

Both a restaurant and a store so you can peruse the aisles for some necessities and treats while you wait. I picked up some dates and a large tin of dessert treats. The food was above average. I got a Chicken Shwarma sandwich which also come with some grilled vegetables and a lentil soup which was outstanding. Good portion size for the $7.25 price tag. My wife got a tabbouleh salad which was also tasty and a good portion for the price. We also got the baba ganoush, I was hoping for a chunkier version like is standard in the Middle East but it was the blended version...still tasty though.

The starter salads were awesome. Falafel had great depth of flavor. The hummus was basic but served with some good hot sauce. She loved her meal. The pita bead was below average, very mass produced tasting. Also the veggies in the grilled veggie side tasted like they were made the morning of.
