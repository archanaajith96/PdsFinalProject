I arrived ten minutes before my reservation, just to have them tell me someone had claimed to be me, and took my reservation, and were currently sitting at my table. These people just pointed to a name on an open and visible reservation list to take claim. Being a busy night, we had to wait a bit for another table to open up. This was just not acceptable. The person I was with is very non-confrontational, so I didn't pursue it, but I made it clear I was upset. Even though I wanted to know who these people were, so I could tell them to get out of my seat. I wish management threw them out or would of made them wait instead of me, or done something else, but hey, no one seemed to care for my opinion. It just grinds my gears when people get away with being garbage because no one will stand up for themselves, so they continue to walk all over everyone. I was such in a foul mood, I couldn't even enjoy my dinner. I wanted to leave, and go somewhere else, but again, my partner wanted to stay, so I was forced to stick around.As for the food, it was decent, but not for the price. I could of gotten oysters x3 the size they served for the same price in the Plaza. The lobster, my main course, was dry and could of been juicy if done right, I can buy lobster half the price at the China market and make it myself better. The appetizer was good and the drinks well made. Would of been happier by the huge bill if they comp a drink or appetizer for the drama I had to go through, especially after a good tip my partner insisted on leaving that I disagreed with because he felt me wanting answers stressed out the door girl - if she was competent enough to hide the reservation list, it would of not been an issue in the first place! Should of sent the check to the table that took our reservation, since they wanted to be us that badly.The servers seemed nice, but mostly too my partner, they in general avoided me because they knew I was upset at there service and would rather avoid an issue instead of fixing it. And one server, despite how busy it was, found the time to neglect her tables and have a nice long conversation with my partner about absolutely nothing, that somehow I became invisible upon. She should really talk to guys on her own time. And I dunno, away from mine. Or if you have that time, it should more be about how your going to fix and or make up the situation that happened. Instead of laughing how your the one who let the couple point out our name, say it was them, and sat them. Too bad I didn't think it was funny.Will never come here again. Not worth it. I could of went to a place like Jax, and gotten the insane \"hook, line and sinker\" for the same price I paid here with tons more and better food (go look). And they would of kept our reservation. You think a Plaza joint would be too expensive and not worth it, compared to this shady place in the middle of nowhere.Yes, I am still salty overall."}, {"review_id": "lss2wK9Zy_Sj912DS1O8gQ", "user_id": "f33bYwUHSjbX7Y7KNaAsmA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/31/2018", "text": "Had the Pacifico ceviche tostadas they were delicious!

However, we were with my parents and they usually know the best hole-in-the-wall places, so we obliged. And, wow - this place is good. We were seated right away with margaritas in our hands shortly after. Our server could not have been better! We chit chatted with her all night, and when they were out of the entree that I wanted, she suggested the perfect alternative. My husband got the stuffed fish and it was out of this world. I got the carne asada (why not) and it was delicious as well. The rice was flavorful without being the typical, seasoned Spanish rice. The Patron margaritas were large and had just the right kick to them. We will definitely be returning and trying more of their menu. I love the casual vibe with high quality food. 5 Stars, Jarocho!"}, {"review_id": "_leF8ecj7zatjBik6vMz3A", "user_id": "CE-Fvm0BR_ytAYR356cgTg", "rating": 2.0, "date": "3/25/2017", "text": "I'm a tad bit shocked at all of the rave reviews for Jarocho because our experience was less than stellar.First and foremost, the place is a dump. Now mind you, I don't care if a place is a dump if the eats are good and cheap. The eats here were neither. Now, if you're going to charge as much as they're charging, perhaps you can even out your parking lot a bit so your patrons don't break their ankles, straighten your sign and clean the place up a bit.  When we arrived at Jarocho, like a faithful Yelper, I checked in and then proceeded to request the check-in offer, but patiently waited for the server to read off the specials first. After placing the request for the check-in offer with the server, she left for a few minutes, then came back and claimed it was sold out because it was the special that day. Wait! What? If it were the special, why wasn't it mentioned when she was reading off the specials? There was no alternative offered, nor an apology for not honoring the check-in offer. Mind you, this is actually not the reason I gave them two stars, but an interesting way to start off our meal. I'm pretty sure they were lying because they didn't want to honor the offer, and I really would have preferred that they be honest and just refuse to honor it. \"I don't wanna\" is better than having your customers think you're dishonest.My hubby ordered a seafood medley seafood cocktail as an app and it came out in a big margarita glass swimming in chilled lobster broth with a hint of cocktail sauce. We were both surprised at how bland it was and how little seafood was in it. It was mostly broth.For our entrees, the hubby had Octopus in Ink which he truly enjoyed. I ordered the Grilled Golden Trout which is supposed to be a butterflied trout. Now, I'm a fan of trout, but not an expert by any means, yet either this was the skinniest trout known to humankind, it was a different fish altogether or they had removed most of the flesh of the fish to use in other dishes. Whatever was the case, there was a lot of skin and very little fish meat. I'm usually someone who enjoys the trout skin, but the skin was rubbery and inedible. Add to that, the fish meat was bland and flavorless. I literally took only three bites and quit there, electing to box the tiny serving up to take home and doctor up so it would be edible.Also, here's another bit to chew on: Shouldn't a Mexican restaurant have good beans? We both requested beans instead of rice as our side dish and that was a massive mistake. We each received a tiny blob of cold flavorless beans.Overall, there was little positive about the experience, yet we paid nearly $100 including tip for lunch. I don't mind paying that much for lunch every now and again if the experience is excellent. This was far from it."}, {"review_id": "sYmBQCBe8d5oyTbOXx270g", "user_id": "ZvT4T0uyOeSqrZ2UzIYL1g", "rating": 2.0, "date": "5/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "**Update**Got clams on the half shell and was under the assumption that I would be getting 6 clams but when they came to the table it was 3 clams shucked and turned over with little remnants of clam in the other side of the shell.

Very sloppy..Prices have increased at least 15% and there's nothing that makes me believe the food cost of every item should of been raised. You aren't getting anything extra for the price hike.This used to be a hidden gem but now it feels like any other corporate restaurant gouging the customer.**Update**The food was phenomenal. Spicy shrimp (perfect brain pounding heat) not too hot. Just right. Mom got the snapper and rice. Perfectly cooked and not dry. Paella was awesome. So much food and not dry (highly recommend)!

It is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant. The only reason that it is not 5 stars is that the food standard is not always consistent.  Jarochos is a small-hole-in-the-wall, dive restaurant with a world class chef. Seating is limited and it can get noisy depending on the crowd. The food is expensive, but it is high quality seafood in my opinion. Also,  they have daily specials that you should definitely check out on their website. I have ordered the following here:Seafood Paella (Rice cooked in lobster broth and includes clams, calamari, fish, shrimp) - Until now, my only experience with paella was watching it made on the Food Network. This was my first time trying  paella and it was fairly decent.  I just wanted to give it a shot, but paella is not really my cup of tea. However, everything was fresh and well seasoned.  So this will be biased to my taste buds. Cost: $22, Rating - 2/5 . Tip : $4 off on WednesdaysFire-Grilled Fish - I believe the fish is grilled trout garnished with red onions. It also comes with a side of rice, side salad, and choice of corn or wheat tortillas. I always order this as I just love the taste of grilled fish. I am not sure what he seasons the fish with, but it is just so fresh and tasty. The side salad is hit or miss. When they add the vinaigrette to the salad , the taste is amazing. However, there have been times when my salad didn't have any or enough vinaigrette. I always enjoy eating this fish. However on my last visit, I did carryout and the fish and salad were too salty. During my dine-in visit, the fish has always been seasoned well and sublime. Cost: $24, Rating: 5/5 for taste (when seasoned properly),  3/5 for consistencyStuffed Fish Filet. This is grilled fish in a creamy, cheesy sauce. It is layered with shrimp, octopus, and crab meat. It is served with rice, side salad, and tortillas. I never knew dairy would pair so well with seafood, but it is done masterfully in this dish. The seafood that it is topped with is hit or miss. Sometimes, all of the mentioned seafood are there, and sometimes it seems like the fish is only topped with shrimp. I think this dish is the most affordable and best bang for your buck. I love making my own tacos with the fish, seafood toppers, rice, and salad. Cost: $15 Rating (5/5 for taste), 3/5 for consistency (not always topped with all 3 seafood items).If you are craving fresh seafood with a Mexican twist, drive out to this joint. When the food is done right, it cannot be beat.  Again, the lack of consistency is the only reason it is not 5 stars."}, {"review_id": "jRcNgO69kot8FUP9TfbszA", "user_id": "ehgclprY114IswrmireW4Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "8/12/2017", "text": "HOLY SEE FOOD BATMAN!!!!   the chef is amazing.  Fresh.  Crazy differernt and good sauces.  A Must check out kinda Place.  Don't go for the place(Kinda dive like).  Go for some amazing food and good service.  Chef came out of the kitchen and made recommendations.  I thought that was cool...."}, {"review_id": "p-0rTzDxya3CPaUfZyx-_A", "user_id": "fCJYoE6FW9gUm75NHxqioQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/23/2016", "text": "I so wanted this to be a great place, the service was good, then it went down hill.

Bizarre. And wonderful. This is why I love this area of town that also boasts the most interesting BBQ chicken joint in town down the street, and Ninfa's, possibly the most intense gut stuffing Hispanic chow in the bottoms (that's saying something).I had to go for a second visit before reviewing. In a word, if you love seafood, you're missing out if you don't make a stop here. Best oysters in town at half the price? Don't tell anyone, please. Food that transports you to another spot in the world? That's what it does for me. Afraid of garlic? Keep driving my friend. Like some chips and hot sauce with your seared baby octopus? That's what my lunch was yesterday.Carlos Falcon. That's the chef's name, and I think the guy is brilliant. My hat is off to someone with the cahonas to open a restaurant that's no frills in decor but has a multitude of entrees reaching towards $20 each, and well worth it. Bay scallop salad, beautifully done. The langostinos with garlic... heaven. Baby octopus, seared with olive oil and garlic. Sublime. If you come: don't expect white table cloths. Expect what looks like your typical KCK street taco joint only with fine seafood. KCMO and JoCos folk you'll likely arrive from the intersection at 7th and Kansas. You can't turn up the street where they're located, it's a one-way so you'll have to do a U-Turn or park across the street. Afraid of parking your Lexus or Beemer next to guys in work trucks? Stick to 119th and Roe in SoJoCo. You'll feel better, and so will most of the folks eating here.Can't wait to return. Can't wait to try everything on the menu. Is it perfect? Nah, and I think the people dining here could care less. I don't. Something really special going on here and the fewer that find out, I'm OK with this as long as their doors remain open."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/jarocho-kansas-city?adjust_creative=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=TpLShpR2csZ2AtLGvsRWXw"]
