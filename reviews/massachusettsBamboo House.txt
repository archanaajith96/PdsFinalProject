The beef pho is out of this world, and if i could eat it everyday for the rest of my life i'd gladly do so. The staff has been punctual and polite every visit, and the restaurant itself is well maintained. Oh! And their butter chicken wings? FANTASTIC. if you're in the area i recommend this place 100%!

Naturally, Bamboo House is the obvious choice for us to take him to since that is where we always take our friends who never had Vietnamese food before. As soon as he took his first bite of pho, we knew that he instantly became a fan.Likewise, I also had the pho and I must admit, pho is my default choice of food after consuming alcohol. The pho at Bamboo House is your prototypical pho. The broth is crisp, clear, and free of fatty residue from the cooking process. It was not overly salty like most pho broths I had elsewhere in the past. The beef and tendon were tender as evident by the way they fell apart in my mouth. The rice noodles were cooked al denté. Overall, the pho was perfectly made. One thing that I requested that is considered a \"secret menu\" item at most Vietnamese restaurants that offer pho is having the rare flank steak served raw on a plate with onions and parsley. Typically, the rare flank steak would be served within the pho, but often times, it could be eaten raw (if you're feeling adventurous) with a squeeze of lime and sriracha sauce. The flank steak was sliced thin enough so that it didn't require a lot of effort to eat. Furthermore, it was not bloody to the point that it looked unappetizing since it was raw. I would recommend eating it in this style if you are feeling adventurous and want to try something new in regards to your pho experience."}, {"review_id": "3bZxvm2oO32veB9hjwfmSg", "user_id": "NW5QNnLQpuBt8Uu2efXHsg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/1/2017", "text": "Best pho around!

If you happen to get it to go like I have it's pretty impressive how it's all packaged. You literally customize your own bowl depending on your tastes. How can you beat the value of this.....less than $10 for a bowl filled with delicious steaming hot soup. Down one of these babies and your satisfied! Do you think you've been good? Deserve to reward yourself? Try an order of spring rolls. These are little crispy packages of absolute love. Yeah I know there're fried...but wrap one of these little jems in the lettuce leaves that come with them and give it a dip in that side of sweet and sour sauce. Satisfying hunger beats guilt any day."}, {"review_id": "1FPNkGQnOYK3Cc6IVMpMyg", "user_id": "DrhDgmkMjprqWAL98qHJBA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/6/2017", "text": "OMG!! My only and first 5 star rating of a restaurant!! Even though the exterior of this place is nondescript and totally unpretentious and plain; the food is what matters most. Try their staple or signature    entree which I believe is also their famous butter and  oniony chicken wings- so yummy good! Little spicy but I like it! Then all their fried rice choices are good esp. the Thai style shrimp or beef option which has a spicy curry flavor I believe which is pleasing to the palate. Will definitely try their other menu offerings next time."}, {"review_id": "rtL66U_6uvwqiPGbIeEh0g", "user_id": "dvH6H0XwleTbykJiRi8HtQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/29/2015", "text": "Cute, small and clean family run spot.

I have had the pho a number of times, but have also tried the salt and pepper shrimp; the quail; spring rolls and shrimp rolls; garlic chicken wings; a shrimp dish (#57) and a noodle and seafood dish.

With that said, I am VERY picky when it comes to properly spiced, garnished, and prepared Vietnamese dishes. From your \"meat and potatoes\" per se, to more elaborate meals like pho, bun bo hue, bun rieu, or even spring rolls - I am very particular, and I know what I want.Hartford county has a very poor and pathetic selection of what I would consider delicious and authentic Vietnamese cuisine. It seems that everywhere I've gone - many places don't seem to care and or are to willing serve msg-laden foods. Having grown up around it, I am very sensitive to that stuff. Let's be real, it makes me sick and it really is the bane to my foodie existence.  However, I will admit that if I ABSOLUTELY must/crave pho, then I will stop by Pho 501 in East Hartford. The menu, location, parking and family are great but it could be so much more. /endrantThis is where Bamboo House of Springfield comes in. I came here with my Mom ironically enough when she wasn't in the mood to cook. And, ever since that lazy date, it's been smooth glutinous sailing..I will proudly say that their: spring rolls, com suon bi cha, muc xao, bo luc lac, bo nuong lui, hu tieu, and pho; it's as good as it gets gang. \"Almost like Mom made it\" and she'll even admit, it's her favorite place to go to. OH, and how can I forget about the coffee?! Parking is to the side and in front of the building/plaza and it can be very limited, prices are consistent with the portion and quality of the food (no surprise bill here) and the staff is always more than willing to explain/elaborate what the dishes are (my guests tend to ask good questions hehe) If you have been apprehensive and or anxious to try Vietnamese (I wouldn't ever understand why, because EVERYTHING is delicious) stop by for a spring roll, or 5 and enjoy :)"}, {"review_id": "MCLU148snfqsI6yn1IZu5w", "user_id": "JQlpLTD8CZ5-8rq3Pl_4GA", "rating": 4.0, "date": "7/13/2017", "text": "The food here was very delicious, far better than I had remembered it; regretfully I haven't been there in years and have forgotten how  superior the quality of food is at the Vietnamese restaurants in the area compared to the Chinese ones... and Bamboo House is no exception.

Its always tough to get legit pho in New England.  This place has great pho.  I always stay away from the tendon in my pho since its usually a chore to chew and swallow-but my friend said it was good here.  He was right..  It was so tender and melts in your mouth.  I was staying in the area for two weeks and come back a second time.The spring/egg rolls are also GREAT.  They give you freshly washed lettuce to wrap them in and the cold lettuce with the freshly fried rolls is an awesome combination.

Summer rolls are yummy.I would agree with another reviewer to stick to the Vietnamese foods. The Chinese food is below mediocre- brother in law had some sort of lo mein or chow mein which was pretty gross. The service was slow, because there was one server for the entire place and there was one huge family that was seated right before us, with all their five kids who were screaming and crying and basically making a huge ruckus.
