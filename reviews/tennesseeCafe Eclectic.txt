I love the black bean burger and burrito and all of the breakfast options. It is also a great place to grab a coffee or tea- their London Fog is amazing. Also- Cafe Eclectic has some cool performers come through every once in a while that can add to your dining experience. The place is usually pretty busy, but it is so good it is worth the wait."}, {"review_id": "o3lUTR7Dbyoo-FIsap3Qqw", "user_id": "DKIz_c_cK1pMcxIuPIK3bg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Great location for hearty, unique takes on breakfast.  The Bacon Waffle was my favorite, and came with bacon mixed in plus more bacon liberally sprinkled on top.  The Chicken -N- Waffles included a large deep-fried breast on top of a generous waffle.  The Vegan Waffle was delicious and filling.  The coffee drinks range from your basic signature drip coffee to expresso creations as well as Cappuccino varites like the impressive Viennese.Service was very good.  Our only hiccup was a run on lox that caused many of us to have to change our selections because they ran out.  Oh well, this means I will need to make another visit!"}, {"review_id": "wBYDrZA44uQzn2wzuTcuaQ", "user_id": "D5KDaeTGfI55rzCxQWL1Hg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/4/2018", "text": "I came to Memphis for a conference and found this on a list of good brunch places near downtown. We got here around 1PM and were seated almost immediately. The service was prompt and our waitress was very nice. I ordered the burger with the vegetables of the day. When I asked my waitress what those vegetables were, she said, \"Umm, a zucchini and squash mix.\" In reality, my plate was filled with zucchini, squash, carrots, and MUSHROOMS. I HATE MUSHROOMS. I didn't make a big deal out of it and just scooped them off my plate. When she saw me doing this, she didn't think twice to comment about it and I was so hungry I just wanted to eat. I asked for some barbecue sauce, that they make in house, but couldn't get any because they have ONE GUY who makes it and he was out. The food came extremely fast but was cooked really well. My burger was amazing and I really enjoyed the honey mustard paired with my meal."}, {"review_id": "hEX97uvO-ysa3iSJLsE9EA", "user_id": "JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/2/2018", "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars. Service was slooooow. Took us 5 minutes to get seated when literally 4 tables were taken. 3 people behind the bar area saw us and didn't care to find us a table. Getting orders and check took a while as well which sucks when you're in a rush. As far as food, prices were very good. Most meals averaged at $10 and coffees seemed reasonable under $4. Biscuits were great and a must order. My 3 egg omelette was fine, especially for $8, but fell apart and had noticeably undercooked peppers and onions. For a quick meal it would be acceptable but for a sit down breakfast, I need a bit more. My apple cider was very good and a nice addition to the menu I rarely see. In all, fine place to grab a coffee and get some work done with free WiFi, but not a must venture for the food unless it's for the biscuits."}, {"review_id": "x10hJ6avJUAi-gDpKg0b8g", "user_id": "lCwFXUHteEK2FD-jn7ZI4A", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "My son and I went here on a Monday before going to the zoo, as its ridiculously close, and ate outside on the patio.  It was not busy at all on a Monday at 10am so that was pleasant.  I ordered the Crème brulate to drink and it was quite delicious!  I love all things sweet and I felt like it was a great balance of sweetness but not going over the top.  For my breakfast I ordered the Inigo Montoya omelet-grilled chicken, white cheddar and pico de gayo.  I am not a big fan of tomatoes so I figured I would just pick some out since the grilled chicken, eggs and cheese idea was totally speaking to me, but there was just so much tomato's it actually kind of ruined the meal for me.  My most favorite part was the homemade biscuits and their, I'm assuming, homemade jam that came with it.  I was trying to refrain, (calorie counting sucks!) but I just could not help myself!  I had mine and my son's- its ok he still got to eat and had a strawberry donut.  :)Overall good experience, cute place, nice view, friendly server, but I would like to try something different for my main course next time."}, {"review_id": "kyaZV4mDWsevw3zL9Nc3YA", "user_id": "nEfUeg6unAn79GbIKoXaTg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "Amazing espresso, and tons of fun coffee drinks!

We looked for several places to eat and they were all closed. We called Cafe Eclectic and they were open.There was alot of ppl waiting but then  again it was a holiday weekend and everyone and their mamas were out to brunch. A 20 min wait was really a 40 min wait but we enjoyed the nice weather outside so we didn't mind.We started with drinks: London Fog, Sinful Jim and Fresh squeezed OJ. Everyone enjoyed their drinks and we were very anxious for each of our entrees to come.There were 3 of us, i had The kitchen sink which was a 3 egg omelet with pork sausage, ham, bacon, tomato, fresh spinach, red onion, mushrooms, bell peppers, jalapeños and white & yellow cheddar. It was that perfectly made omelet that was hearty and yummy for your first meal of the day. We thoroughly enjoyed it.My friend who had stole my first choice went with the Sunny Tater Hash which consisted of Fried russet & sweet potato hash with bell pepper & onions, topped with bacon, jalapeños, white cheddar & a sunny side up egg. This was good but a bit heavy since it was fried. We were all mehh about it.My 3rd friend opted to go with a wrap, Rachel's breakfast wrap that is. It was stuffed with Scrambled eggs, bell peppers, caramelized onions, avocado, tomato, bacon & white cheddar in a warm tortilla. I thought this was better than my omelet. It was so delicious that i'm thinking about ordering this next time for myself. A nice wholesome breakfast burrito with eggs, bacon  and avocado. What more could you ask for?We all thought this place was a great brunch spot. Indoor and outdoor seatings are available. They have a full lunch and dinner menu as well. I can't believe it took me this long to find out about Cafe Eclectic. Another gem in Memphis! Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu out#Yelp901 #Eatlocal #Memphiseats #Yelpmemphis"}, {"review_id": "MU-ugynlU9B6jI6kLKRrdw", "user_id": "h7p-GuaHFGsiKCF4g6Bjqg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/28/2018", "text": "Very charming cafe in Memphis. My husband and I got breakfast here when we were visiting his brother in Memphis a few weekends ago. They have a large and varied menu (even for coffee), from classic breakfast dishes to creative! I chose something from their \"Lighter Side\" part of the menu - The Funky Salmon: smoked salmon, cream cheese, fresh spinach, tomato, and cucumber on a toasted English muffin. It was light and healthy and yet still really tasty. My husband really enjoyed his chicken biscuits. The menu is also very vegetarian- and vegan-friendly if you or anyone in your party enjoys veg options. This cafe is a Memphis institution, and you can see why. It's classic, simple, and hasn't hipster-ized to keep up with the trends. It's just charming and simple and good food."}, {"review_id": "Nbk47jm2W3qjm7RzjxCbvQ", "user_id": "JoNCq8cmvcugDFEqTB35zw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "1/22/2018", "text": "This place is sort of an overrated cafe with slight hippie vibes. I think the food is good, but it's not great. The food can also be overpriced for what it is. I usually get orange juice and the stuffed French toast when I go here. The orange juice is fresh and taste good, but it also comes in a tiny glass. The French toast is also good, but again nothing really to brag about. Whenever I get hash browns they are always under salted.

The cappuccino I had was very good, and we had wings as an appetizer. I believe they were honey hot flavor, and they were VERY good, they were the best part of the entire trip. The wings took a while to come out and our food did too. There were other people in the patio area that were taken of faster than we were, but I just thought it might have been because we had an appetizer. My friend ordered a melt, and when placing his order, the server asked wrap? And he said no the melt. I ordered the diablo wrap, which the menu said had their diablo chicken, spinach, and cream cheese. When we got our food, they brought my friend the wrap instead of the melt, and they quickly fixed it for him. One bite into my wrap, and there were onions in it, which wouldn't have been a problem if they were listed on the menu. So I mentioned it to the person who brought out the food, and I said if I had known there were onions on it I would have asked for none, and he informed me that that was part of their mix for the diablo chicken. Again, not a problem if they had simply had this on the menu. As a first timer, I had no idea what was or wasn't part of any mixes. I kept my food mostly because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes to get something else and just picked the onions off. The chicken was a little over cooked and overall the wrap was dry and not nearly as flavorful as I thought it would be. Luckily I have no allergies to onions, I'm just picky haha. But I definitely think a comma and one more ingredient on the menu could have helped this review. The food was hit and miss, the service was average, and the prices were good. But from as much as I've heard about this place, it definitely seems overrated. I would definitely try it again to try food I'm more likely to enjoy and to see if the experience I had was just a hiccup."}], "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-eclectic-memphis-5?adjust_creative=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA&start=20&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=t_Pv8b42mVVirl02q-i0FA"]
