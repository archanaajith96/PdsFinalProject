This is NOT Korean BBQ. Not even close. You get a giant bowl of white rice with pieces of iceberg lettuce (which they don't use in Korean cooking, by the way), and a skimpy portion of meat. My noodle bowl was white rice, bland noodles and then some mayo/orange concoction meant to add spicyness. Nasty. I nearly vomited. All this for awesome bargain price of $8 a bowl. I've tasted mediocre Korean food, and this is worse. And because this business advertises food as Korean BBQ, most people unfamiliar with Korean food will think this is actually Korean food. It's not. This is worse than fake. Even my kid knows that. Best Korean restaurants in LA charge this much for great lunch food. Don't waste your time or money."}, {"review_id": "zTQUTngEhIQBlur8vfy83g", "user_id": "LqnLyED1vDj2y_e208ZH8w", "rating": 1.0, "date": "8/29/2017", "text": "Service at the food truck was fast and upbeat. The food...I couldn't eat it, and I was starving!I love most Asian foods and have eaten a lot of rice and noodle dishes. This is not a food for anyone who doesn't like multiple sauces nor unusual textures. (I wish I had seen someone's bowl before I ordered.) I requested an order of mandoo (3 potstickers) and the cup with shredded pork. As it was explained to me, people typically put the mandoo on top of the bowl. OK, I agreed. Then I watched 3 sauces being squeezed on the bowl to make my junior spice, and I knew I was in trouble.Too many creamy sauces; should have asked for it on the side, AND I was given one mandoo (I wasn't charged for an order) and it was also buried under the sauce. Pork had the texture of meat that had been put in the blender. I liked the glass noodles - they had been spared the majority of the sauce - and then I got to the rice in the bottom. The texture was horrible, as if it had sat too long. It disintegrated in my mouth.I had my husband pull over at the nearest garbage so I could dispose of it. I was still starving, but I just couldn't deal with all the textures."}, {"review_id": "5F3nPHxmOsmlhchr_N02VA", "user_id": "yF1D4Q1Nk23XdgsGfQyThA", "rating": 3.0, "date": "9/12/2017", "text": "I went into my first Cupbop experience with really high expectations. I'd heard so much about it from my friends, and thought that I just had to give it a try. Now, I do LOVE Korean food. I have eaten quite a bit over the years and have found some good places along the Wasatch Front to pick up some delicious, fairly authentic Korean food. So, going to Cupbop, I figured I would have another one of those amazing experiences.  Well, after all the hype, I was slightly underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, but it's definitely not authentic Korean.  My wife, kids and I stopped by on a Friday night and picked ourselves up a couple bowls. The weather was great, so we were able to sit down at one of their outdoor tables to enjoy our meal. I got my bowl fairly spicy, and made sure to get the one that has a mix of noodles and rice, along with chicken and beef. That's where things didn't go exactly as I had hoped. I was expecting a beef that had that bulgogi taste. But...it didn't. Again, it wasn't bad at all, but not what I would have expected. Same with the chicken...good, but not what I would have expected. Anyway, if you're not familiar with traditional Korean food, give this place a shot. And if you are, you should still give it a shot. Just don't go into it expecting authentic Korean, that's all. Would I go back? Probably."}, {"review_id": "DZc_lBaOppkg-7LFarWWFg", "user_id": "1prVpumNNs_6LmHR_6opYA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "12/4/2016", "text": "No. just... no.You should know this from the getgo: I'm a food purist. As much as I try to love cheap, fusion grub, I've never gotten behind even Roy Choi, the mastermind behind both the food truck and Korean fusion movements.But I know Roy well enough to know that he would be embarrassed to know that he gave rise to Cupbop.Cupbop, my friends, has no element of flavor consideration or refinement. There is very little thought in the dishes: you can get bulgogi or galbi over rice and sweet potato noodles, and then they drown the bowl--DROWN it--in gochujang and mayo-based sauces. What you get is an awful mush of melded flavors that is one note (essentially gochujang) and completely takes away from any savory qualities that the meat has to offer.I got the combo bowl, and what pork and beef I was able to save from saucy damnation was dry and undermarinated. CupBop relies on the sauces to do all of the flavor work and doesn't put any more care into the meats than they have to. No good.Both the mandu--kimchi and pork--are no good. They were soggy and the fillings were not well prepared or flavorful.If for some reasons I had to go back to CupBop, I would order the bowl totally dry and would get some sauce on the side so I could add it on or dip in it according to what I want. Then and only then it might be 2.5-3 stars. The experience I had was 1.5 stars."}, {"review_id": "cxH04xLi6mjY0lbHBQ6ybQ", "user_id": "qjuupEis71P5H6we2NpvTg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/20/2018", "text": "My husband loves them.

It's crazy how much Cupbop has grown in popularity in Utah. While they aren't the most authentic of bibimbap's, it is fantastic and always hits the spot. This review is specifically for the Provo location but the food in all locations and trucks are mostly all the same. Service here is always really friendly. Though there's typically a huge line everywhere else, I've never had to wait super long here. The outdoor seating may be more inconvenient than a normal restaurant, they accommodate for your comfort as much as possible. We came on a rainy day and sat in the enclosed seating area and it was equipped with heaters. I always get the Combo bop so I can a little bit of everything. Sometimes they include free mandu, sometimes you pay for it, sometimes they run out. But mandu is a nice treat on top of the entree if you have the chance to try it. It is a little overpriced like others have said but not enough to steer me away from coming when I am craving it. The only complaint I have is that sometimes they sauce too little and sometimes they sauce way too much. Depending on which, the meal is too bland or too overpowering. It seldom happens but when it does, it puts a damper on the meal."}, {"review_id": "o34aOoOV9DxWagz4cjbELA", "user_id": "_0oY8NxXSBGxXkdjGm-mGA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/2/2018", "text": "We absolutely love cupbop and this location always makes it the best.

Tried a combo and mando. With the combo you get 2 choices of meat. I had the spicy deep fried chicken and beef. The chicken is only sold at a location not a food truck. After asking the worker (cool guy from New York) what he recommended, he said the spicy deep fried chicken. It was delicious and had a nice crunch to it. The beef was tasty as well. I tried the level 8 spice. It wasn't too spicy but yet didn't leave your mouth on fire. It had enough heat where you could still enjoy the flavors of the meat. The rice was cooked perfectly as well.

I am a die hard fan of the Toc Bop. One of the things I love most about Cupbop is their levels of spiciness that go from a 1-10. For me being raised eating spicy food since I was a little one, the 8 is a great option if you want to have it be spicy but still be able to enjoy the food comfortably. Every once in a while, I'll go with a 9 and it is a very noticeable difference in heat and flavor. I once made the mistake of getting a 9 and requesting extra sauce. If you're in the mood to teach yourself a lesson I'd go with that.I love the overall feel and vibe of Cupbop, they have some of the nicest employees who will a lot of the time start conversations with you and are always friendly.

It's not exotic or pure or transcendent. It's not even shamelessly decadent, like the deep-fried sushi dishes it takes condiment inspiration from. It's simpler than that: a soft, warm, sweet Sriracha bowl with a few minor elements of texture.\"Food truck\" is the perfect setup for this kind of thing. You wouldn't take someone here on a first date, nor is it the place for a weekly lunch with your buddies. But it would be nice as an occasional working lunch, a break from the normal places inside your 2-mile radius.I ordered the Hot Bop (pork). The guy working the truck, who was very friendly, asked what spice level I wanted between 1 and 10. Which begged the question: are we on an Indian food scale or a Taco Bell scale? As it turns out, it's somewhere in between, but closer to the Indian food scale. He said that if I'm used to eating jalapenos/habaneros, then a 7 or an 8 is about right. I went with the 7 just to play it safe, but I think I will get an 8 next time. It was comfortably spicy.A few things could be improved, I think. More vegetables would be welcome (maybe some bok choy, for authenticity). The presence of two starches (noodles and rice) was distracting, and one of them could easily have been left out. I wasn't sure all the sauces were pulling their weight--spicy mayo fades into the background of almost any other flavor. And something crunchy or flaky would have been nice, to counterbalance the general moosh factor.But for the price, I won't complain too much. It's a nice carb splurge and probably the spiciest thing I'm likely to find during my lunch break."}, {"review_id": "HCQ3yMs63SMdaPkE095DaA", "user_id": "o2DUnLwfunyuDmJojse11Q", "rating": 1.0, "date": "7/3/2017", "text": "It's amazing to me how much people like this place.

YumBasically I feel like I'm paying for a sauce... They should switch up the iceberg for fresh cabbage or romain because there is absolutely no nutrition in these cups.
