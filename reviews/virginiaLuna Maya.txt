The cocktails are delicious as well! I can't visit without an order of their Taquitos Vegetarianos and a Passion Fruit Mojito.It is on the pricier side, but I think it's worth it. The atmosphere is great too! If you can sit outside, do it!"}, {"review_id": "_k1d-I1po_G2rJ6jbXxlnA", "user_id": "vD_ZHw4_Kb7bztos6q2PyA", "rating": 2.0, "date": "4/7/2018", "text": "TLDR: Way overpriced, mediocre, cheap chips, decent habanero sauceI was actually rather excited to try this place with all the favorable reviews, as I am slowly making my around Tidewater to find the best tacos/burritos in town. I must give a warning that I have been to Texas and California (the best places outside of Mexico) and have had, in my opinion, some rather amazing food. This means the bar is usually set moderately above most other peoples when it comes to these kinds of foods. Typically, most mexi places offer up a complimentary chips and salsa with your meal, so when I have to actually pay for it, I expect it to be tasty. I can't believe this place had the audacity to serve Tostitos chips with my salsa for $4. I knew immediately by the poor flavor, over salted, plastic taste (from the cheap bag) that these were obviously bottom shelf chips. Take the time to see the attached photo and tell me thats NOT a Tostito's. After getting over the initial sticker shock of seeing $13-18 burritos on the menu, I decided on the lime chicken burrito with the extra hot habanero sauce. For $13 I was expecting something totally amazing, typically you charge more for food when it takes longer to prepare or if it has gourmet ingredients. I was underwhelmed and found the burrito to have the dreaded \"uneven distribution of ingredients\" curse by someone in the kitchen who hasnt been trained thoroughly on how to roll a burrito so you get an equal amount of ingredients on every bite. I added an extra star because the habanero sauce was extremely tasty, otherwise, yawn."}, {"review_id": "UhMHvtQ_QPGetbBLXx6zow", "user_id": "DgHdEvF9E8_QXDpBuXA_Lw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "12/9/2017", "text": "Kristi was very helpful, we got the famous temales and the chorizo queso, spicy guaca, Quesadilla , shrimp tacos and they were GREAT!

It's a great place for a meal with friends, family, or a date. I came here with coworkers for a weeknight dinner and the service was just right. We had drinks, appetizers, and dinner in 1.5 hrs. I got the Tamales Luna Maya which is apparently a house specialty. The corn was sweet and delicious, and the brisket was super tender. It was a perfect combination of flavors in your mouth. The sides were simple rice and black beans, which weren't anything to brag about, but I wasn't there for rice and beans anyway. We also had guac and queso appetizers, which helped add flare to my rice and beans. Some of my coworkers got brisket burritos which looked pretty tasty (and massive) so I plan on trying that next time. One thing about this restaurant is that it is a bit hard to find. It's on the corner of Colley and 21st St in Ghent, and it sits adjacent to an Anytime Fitness center. But the front entrance looked like a back door, and without visible signs in the dusk, I walked past it twice before realizing it. They could probably put some sign out front especially on rainy days when there is nothing on the patio and things are a little harder to see."}, {"review_id": "HYIV3Ht1uBfXsBTgHqVSTA", "user_id": "m4owlulRClLZ5CJyNLbVHw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "5/2/2018", "text": "I had dinner here in the private room with Luna Maya catering so I cannot speak to a regular dining experience here.  However, the food was fine, but rather bland.  There simply wasn't a lot of seasoning or flavor in the meats (we had a variety).  The chips were good, thick and crispy.  The queso and salsa were the best parts of the meal.  I did not drink, but the cocktails looked amazing!"}, {"review_id": "ar-iNmSbsJenp99f1p-36g", "user_id": "ca0mEQNMJ3ttDgRs1qxl8g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/13/2018", "text": "Hands down amazing food!

Started with two mixed drinks (can't quite remember what they were called but one was mango). Tried the guac and that was flavorful and good- wasn't too spicy.

I've gone here a couple times but have failed to write a review. On my last visit, a friend had made a reservation for 8 people and our table was ready when we got there in the smaller area in the restaurant. There is plenty of seating available and I've never had to wait long for a table. I wasn't much in a drinking mood, but I have had a delicious mojito before. Service is also usually great. The menu has a large selection of your typical Mexican items, but the flavor at Luna Maya is top notch. I highly recommend trying their tamales. It is one of their house specialty items and well worth it! The chile sauce is amazing and not too spicy. I've also tried their burritos which are packed with flavor and meat.I would come back here with a group of friends or for a date night. I definitely want to come back and try more items on the menu, but those tamales will always be my favorite!"}, {"review_id": "IwDNwf-o4H3Lw5-tXzShbg", "user_id": "AukB9dGtCrSsuNSLB87tTw", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/28/2017", "text": "This place gets pretty busy in the evening but I managed to have a seat out on the patio with a buddy. I ordered the Margatini and their mushroom quesadilla (which was delicious!). My food came out pretty fast, but my buddies came out so late that we had to get it to-go and he ate it while walking down the street. I'm not sure if our waitress was swamped or the cooks were backed up. My Margatini with Chipotle Salt set my lips on fire and it was hot outside but it was refreshing! The prices for the drinks and food during their Happy Hour are pleasant. The décor was pretty inside and easy on the eyes with their lighting. Small tables in the main room and bigger seating in the back. I didn't have a large amount of time to wander the entire place to get the full effect so I'll have to go back for round 2."}, {"review_id": "o2mGjYwU_Zky2M9TIFuVMg", "user_id": "IIiDBRUG0rHz5tPSTPHQwQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "12/21/2016", "text": "Celebrated my cousin's bday dinner here on a Friday night and it was my first time. If I had to give a theme for this restaurant, I would say \"industrialized romance\". From floating bulb lighting to candle lit tables, from the masonry brick walls to the beautiful hanging mirror, and from the open ceiling vents to the fancy black ceiling tiles. Had reservations but wasnt able to sit everyone together, so the restaurant accommodated us with free Guacamole and Queso with chips for both sides of the table . Finally ordered their beef brisket burrito and topped it off with their homemade queso sauce. It was pretty good!

The food was still incredible and 5/5 stars in my book. I also tried the cilantro chicken tacos, which were really good and not too dry. There was plenty of food and lots of good flavor in the various toppings for the tacos.There were a couple things of note that were a bit disappointing and tempted me to drop a star. First, the poblanos were significantly smaller than last time, which was sad to see.  Second, the service was not optimal; I came with a large group and luckily we were able to squeeze at the community table.  We were initially told the wait would be 45-60 minutes, but were then told that it'd be an additional hour of waiting after we had already been waiting at least 30 minutes. All the time, there was a perfectly empty large table that sat empty when we arrived and remained so for 45 minutes.  The wait for the food after ordering was not bad at all, but there definitely needed to be several reminders to the waitstaff of what food was missing, and there was still a couple of errors in the food that was brought out.Side note: our waitress was really (almost aggressively) on top of water refills, which was both entertaining and appreciated."}, {"review_id": "SnAf32gu7QuVoGPLs9-v6w", "user_id": "R6PI0-sSYhmR2HZwMm5Y9g", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/7/2018", "text": "Food is very good here but the price is really high and because it's over priced we no longer eat here.
