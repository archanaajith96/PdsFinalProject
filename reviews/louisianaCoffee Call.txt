They have the option of going through the drive through, or walk in. They're open late too for your late night craving. We decided to eat in and had a great experience. The employees were all very friendly, and service is quick. There are many tables here making it easy to find seating and they're family friendly. The beignets are delicious, but my favorite is the beignet fingers. They pile the plate high and you could split them between 2-3 people, if you wanted to. We got the hot chocolate and it was delicious. We will definitely be back!"}, {"review_id": "S2zdFVinn-k5PT5n1mN9EQ", "user_id": "4WP2dOtfyjNGscX7LmoK9g", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "Love this place!

Beignets were fresh, hot and oh so darn good! Problem? No one bussing tables. I had to clear one for my Aunt and I to sit at. Lastly, rude older gentleman was telling me I couldn't move the stuff off the dirty table. Strange. We're set for another coffee and beignet outing this weekend. I hope the experience this time is as good as the coffee and beignets!"}, {"review_id": "VKFdyR2meRlRAHNJUb2Zjg", "user_id": "dYCmh8rJl_ZkC_mt70ZDhQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2/3/2018", "text": "Every time I visit Baton Rouge.., I always come here! This place is that good! Their prices are low and the quality & quantity are excellent. They can get crowded on weekends, but they have plenty of seating. Even if they are crowded, there will always be someone leaving soon, and a seat & table will be available soon. They have early & late hours everyday, and opened 24 hours on weekends. Their Monday-Thursday hours are 6am-2am; whereas on Friday's, they will remain open throughout the weekend.As for the ambiance, all the employees are extremely friendly. Even though they may be crowded, this is a perfect place to gather friends together, meet someone and just catch-up and have a conversation together. As for the food.., just thinking about it is making me hungry! You have to order their beignets, their beignet fingers, and their café au lait. Their portions are big & their flavor is so delicious, it's worth every penny! The next time I'm in Baton Rouge again, I'll be making another visit here."}, {"review_id": "_qfrvlPZT0x9pBgWsAOYtA", "user_id": "WKIW7tWyMq7_XN0V2ouo0A", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/2/2018\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review", "text": "Powdered sugar, now who doesn't love that? There is so much of it to go around. Just if you didn't think you got enough on your plate, there is more on your in a sifter on the table. Fries beignets in finger form or regular square shapes, really it's your preference. This cafe serves the masses daily and does it well. Customer service with a smile and a cup of cafe au lait to make your day just a little bit brighter. I love this place and it just wouldn't be Baton Rouge without Coffee Call callin your name. Though it may not be Cafe Du Monde, they have managed to make a name for themselves that sets them apart from their competitors. Now, we have something here in Baton Rouge that puts us right up there with the competition. These beignets are something to talk about!"}, {"review_id": "-nnc0buQyVJ16kzodqNE_w", "user_id": "cUGfK8fjzqSC834H6D5lFQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/30/2018", "text": "We had a local tell us about this place and we did not know what we were getting ourselves into! There was so much passion and knowledge from all the people that worked here. They define the rich culture of Louisiana hands down!!!!Before I tell you how awesome this place is this is a great place to get information for great spots in the rest of the city. They definitely know what's going on in the city, know about events, know how to get around easy and just all out all the Good Eats there is in Louisiana!They let us try the Beignets before we actually had them since we never had them before. We were simply looking for a coffee place and just did a random selection on Google search. I'm so glad we picked this one over all others. The actual location is all off in the corner by itself and I have no clue why because this is one of the best kept secrets in Louisiana! They give you just enough powder the Beignets were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I kid you not! We were in the French Louisiana times I tell you. The venue is great and plenty of spaces to sit with plenty of sunlight ambient sounds and people checking in on you at all times. It is very easy to make a mess with all the powder in the way they stack it up but that's okay because it is so good and well worth it. They have good old school coffee cups and mugs to make you feel modern but still nostalgic. You can tell that it's been a family-run business for very long time. I don't know what more to say except GO THERE NOW! Have fun"}, {"review_id": "pbqW1WBZg3ev_bX2mI1yLw", "user_id": "Kr4NAUL6lUcwjYA4rxAOEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "1/4/2018", "text": "This place is insane!! It's HUGE SPACE so many tables to sit.

So glad my friend drove us here. We bought the fingers and the beignets. I like fingers easier to eat:) lots of powder and doesn't seem greasy but prob is. The hot chocolate with it is PERFECT combo I'm in love. Not too sweet but so GOOD FRESH AND HOT!!! Cost: I think total was 4$ something for SO MUCH BEIGNET fingers  and the regular ones!Service: everyone was so warm and friendly and wish us happy New Years !! The guy over and cleaned up our mess (big mess) It's been here for 14 years and I hope it continues cus it's a LIT place apparently 24 hrs :) Would def come back here it's such dope vibes and delicious :) taste like funnel cakes but SO MUCH BETTER"}, {"review_id": "aHtxfxu1RZBgzgV3P0I-SA", "user_id": "_l8xI0MCMZz2B9hSzelXhg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/10/2017", "text": "BEST BEIGNETS EVER...outside of NOLA!Walking in, the aroma of fresh beignets and cafe au lait transports me back to carefree days and nostalgic childhood memories. As kids, my siblings and I were fascinated watching the staff make beignets. Coffee Call has been in Baton Rouge for as far back as I can remember. Whether we had family or friends visiting, spur of the moment visits or late night cravings, it was always a tradition to make a trip to Coffee Call.Here's the low down: grab a tray, stand in line cafeteria style, and help yourself to some self-service cafe au lait or hot chocolate. Let one of the staff members(if they haven't already asked) behind the counter know what type of beignets you'd like to order- traditional style (an order of 3 is $2.50) or a basket of beignet fingers (small $2.75, large $4.50). At the register, you can order the specialty coffees like iced cafe au lait or a cappuccino icer. Afterwards you can grab a seat since there's plenty of indoor seating and a few tables outside. This location and atmosphere is so much more cleaner than Cafe Du Monde in the French Quarter and you won't be fighting the crowds either!My family enjoys sharing a large basket of beignet fingers. I prefer the beignet fingers because they are the right size for dipping into your cafe au lait. Coffee Call's beignets are warm, fresh, light and fluffy clouds of fried doughy goodness, sprinkled with the right amount of powdered sugar. Do you hear what I hear?! Coffee Call is calling your name- come and get them! Make memories with your family and friends by continuing the Coffee Call tradition. Enjoy the holiday season with some beignets and cafe au lait whenever you're in Baton Rouge."}, {"review_id": "M9iOsW9d8e_05YznXiCzVg", "user_id": "8Jzj9ZK9iZDqqFBRxzLlEQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/30/2017", "text": "Coffee Call is a Baton Rouge institution. I frequented it as a college student and loved it. Every time I go back to BR I have to make a stop and get my beignet fix. Drop by at 11pm on a Friday and it is probably more packed than you'd think. I love it.They have an open kitchen so you can see your beignets getting tossed in the hot oil and puff up into the nice pillowy squares of dough. Really their beignets are all that. The prices are ridiculous cheap too, 3 beignets for $2.50. You can't beat that.Fair warning: eating beignets is a messy messy affair. There is powdered sugar everywhere. If there isn't then you're doing it wrong. But...if you want to try to keep the mess to a minimum, then you can go for the beignet fingers."}, {"review_id": "VM0AfI7GBsfqWDHjNpLhYQ", "user_id": "1yizm-DgDr-jCQv2KcCqMA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/10/2018", "text": "Once a year we drive to an annual event, passing Baton Rouge. We wanted to have a midway stop with coffee and beignets, thus stumbled upon Coffee Call. Never been inside, just drive through, so cannot speak for atmosphere and cleanliness. But food is really great! Very generous with powered sugar, yum! You can get regular beignets and a smaller version, called \"fingers\". I was pleasantly surprised I liked them better because they had more \"outside\" and I like that crispness. Small bag of fingers is a pretty good size, and I could not finish it all in one sitting. Overall, we have stopped at this place three different time a year apart, and it's always been delicious.

So obviously I had to try them:1) Beignet Fingers: Very crisp and airy. Honestly, as I'm writing this, I can't seem to come up with the words to describe the taste of a beignet, but they are excellent. I think next time I would prefer a normal of beignets rather than the fingers, but still a great experience.2) Coffee: just average.Be warned that there will probably be a gigantic line when you go, but the line moves pretty fast and the beignets are worth it! They also have some other items on the menu that sound pretty good.

If you've never been, get in line and grab a tray with either hot chocolate or cafe au lait. Then once at the cashier tell her your preference from the menu. We tried the beignet fingers. So good. We watched them make it as soon as we ordered. Surprisingly no one was in the sitting area. I'm sure after midnight it's a totally different story. A small order is plenty for 2 people.

Many old folks. I have the Cafe Au Lait and beignets. The coffee does produce the aroma and great taste. Sugar is added by your own request. The beignets was fried crispy and top with powder sugar. If you want to eat this beignets, it will be messy. I can guarantee you will look like Santa Clause after you got all the powder sugar around your mouth. Unfortunately there is no lady clause. Most lady eat and wipe at the same time. The other trick is to spread your leg open while eating. So the powder sugar won't be all over your long pant.
