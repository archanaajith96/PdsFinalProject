We ordered the fried chicken wings with drumsticks and the jalapeño black bean noodle since every table seems to have a bowl of noodles. The chicken wings were AMAZING, so crispy, crunchy, flavorful with ginger, garlic, soy sauce taste. I have had smoother texture of the chicken wing flesh but these wings definitely win first place for flavor!I was also surprised with the noodle, they really infused the jalapeño into the black bean sauce. Compared with the Korean version, this one is less oily and more texture to the sauce. I would definitely definitively want to come back."}, {"review_id": "QZW9L078RQzT1zZxZbI6bw", "user_id": "wKFmGpSstN937nv1IWWv5w", "rating": 4.0, "date": "5/8/2018", "text": "Obviously, you are going to have to wait at this restaurant.

Enough about me - the fact is, in my opinion, this place has fallen off. Despite the negative health inspections, I still had a love for this place except for my two recent take out orders. I live in Oakland and any time I'm in the city and able to come thru San Tung, I do! The past two times, the take out was just not worth it. Now, maybe because it is take out and I'm not dining in, that the experience is different. The cherry pork I ordered the past two times, half the entree is inedible to me. It seems they put far too much breading than they do meat, and you're left with crunchy pieces of fried breading. The sauce is still amazing. I end up tossing half of the entree away and try to salvage the sauce for the rice. The chicken fried rice, still delicious and well it's hard to mess that entree up. The chicken wings are still delicious, but at times they are over fried. The sauce is what makes the wings, and in fact most of the dishes here taste delicious because of their sauces.The portions are very large, but the prices definitely went up. This place is still just as busy as ever, but sadly I think they have let the hype take over the quality. I won't give up on this place, but it looks like I'll have to try another spot when I come to the city."}, {"review_id": "fYsMEfLwcaz_6vrB1L0nKQ", "user_id": "lbEY6U0t_Qda65OuouxoOQ", "rating": 3.0, "date": "4/22/2018", "text": "I used to love you so much, San Tung! Why did you have to go and become so cheap!!!!!!!! I still love their food but in the past few years I've come much less because the lines are just getting so ridiculous that it wasn't worth it anymore. However, I came here last week and managed to get seated pretty quickly since they just opened for dinner. I was super disappointed to find out that: 1. they started charging for the what was once complementary kim chi. 2. they started to charge you for refills on rice. I really can't wrap my head around why they used to give away kim chi like it was nothing, literally just slapped a fat plate of that shit on your table then all of a sudden they decide to start charging you for a small ass plate of it. It would have been better had they just stopped selling it completely so situations like this wouldn't happen (i.e, someone bitching about being charged for kim chi) Also, completely understandable that they charge for rice, a lot of restaurants do but if you are going to charge a table of four for four bowls of rice THEN GIVE US 4 BOWLS OF RICE WORTH YOU CHEAP ASS. Our waiter brought out our rice in one of those rice tubs but was not even half filled. The rice was only enough to feed two persons. I hate hate hate when restaurants become more and more popular and suddenly become super cheap, you know you can afford it so why are you playin. I just think it's not right for a business to change and start charging for everything just because they know they can. Kind of sucks for everyone that is paying good money and supporting your business. Also, I understand sometimes there is a language barrier between waiters and customers but I really could not understand what this one waiter was saying. I really don't think he spoke english, had no idea what he was saying and when asked to please repeat himself, he just started screaming angrily. I don't think that is good customer service."}, {"review_id": "GjGSZg5miKeFU4tvjWatdQ", "user_id": "i5AYgyUuDRZaHrHa7CUtAA", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/4/2018", "text": "Home of the crack wings! Whenever I come to SF, I have to get the wings dry-style.  They are so crunchy, crispy, savory/sweet and just amazing!  We usually get two orders of the wings and a couple other dishes (dumplings, noodles, garlic green beans or fried rice) but the main attraction is the wings!  Give it a try and you will not regret it.

Rich settlers would hire immigrants from Africa, China, and other nations to pan for nuggets. It's one of many reasons why San Francisco has such a diverse culture within their walls. You can literally get Mexican, Mediterranean or Chinese food blocks away. A metropolitan filled with love, peace, and food.Everyone that I had talked to about San Francisco would always bring up San Tung. They would mention that if I ever visited San Francisco, I should stop by at San Tung and try their fried wings. The night that my friend and I stayed in S.F, we made sure to stop by San Tungs for dinner. We got to the building and there was a 1 1/2 half wait just for a table of 2. We signed in our name and played the waiting game.After the long wait, we immediately ordered food once we got seated. We got the dry sauteed green beans and the wet fried wings, and a small pot of jasmine rice.The green beans came out first and they were sauteed perfectly. The green beans were still al dente and had a nice sweet and salty flavoring to it. It was a great appetizer. The second course was the fried wings and once I had bit into that piece of wing, it was like my tastebud died and gone to heaven. That sweet soy sauce glaze that was tossed with the chicken was by far one of the delicious tasting wings I had ever had at a restaurant. It was sweet, savory and had a bit of a heat coming from Szechwan peppers. The wings were crispy on the outside moist on the inside. A phenomenal meal. This is on my list of *MUST TRY*. It was an overall great experience, if it wasn't for the long wait, I would have given this place a 5 star but other than that, the service was good and the food was great!"}, {"review_id": "FGda9vX6JKARcyIu36XAig", "user_id": "5re8RQ-2-Mkz7LC4ftYfHw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "3/13/2018", "text": "Like everyone else, I came here for the dried friend chicken wings. So yes, this review is solely for their chicken wings and sautéed greens beans. Those two are a must-get! so much that I only get those two when I eat here (and rice) hahahahI really recommend trying their chicken wings here if you love asian fried chicken wings. If you've ever had Bon Chon or 99 chicken, San Tung sauce is similar to that, but has a little kick to it. But the biggest difference is their breading! For those places, their breading is thicker so the sauce gets absorbed in the sweet crunchy layerAt San Tung, their chicken barely has any breading/batter so you get the saucy, sticky, savory, sweetness that coats the entire chicken. It makes your first bite super flavorful and very crispy! The sautéed greens beans is amazeballs here. probably bc its hella garlicky and has a has a nice crunch when you bite into it. these are so addicting to eat. EVEN if you're one of those people who don't really eat vegetables, I promise. The wait is pretty long, so dont be afraid to put your name down for their second restaurant too, which is right next door! The menu is practically the same and its much quieter. The staff isn't too bad, considering its a Chinese run restaurant. They take your order pretty fast and you get your food just the same. Lots of hustle and bustle in the main restaurant. parking always sucks around here, and don't forget to keep all your belongings safe!"}, {"review_id": "3fiBZ9QRM6X1AbMw7rzo7Q", "user_id": "UP0kMbDaK6_aaBPtVJ7kpg", "rating": 3.0, "date": "3/28/2018", "text": "I haven't been to this place in a few years. There will definitely be a wait for your table/seats. The chicken wings are always highly spoken of. Items ordered were: 1)Sizzling rice soup- soup is super bland and the rice is soggy after when it's put in to the soup. 2)Dried sauteed String beans - Definitely felt like I needed to eat greens from all the carbs and wings. For some reason, the string beans had a very over powering sweet taste to it. Couldn't really taste the garlic. 3)Dry Fried chicken wings - WAY TOO SWEET 4)Black bean sauce noodles- This is probably my favorite dish here. Comes with seafood so that's a plus. I don't know if it's because I'm getting older, but the dishes here are way too sweet for me!"}, {"review_id": "YmfQdP-b94KHUXi7B4-2qg", "user_id": "u1P7POW_Hy4V8xaOWbvf8g", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/18/2018", "text": "My friend & I visited SF for a minigetaway & San Tung made it on our long list of food places to try! We ordered the Sautéed String Beans, Black Bean Sauce Noodles, & of course, the Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings. The Sautéed String Beans were crispy and delicious. It was sautéed in this flavorful garlic sauce. Definitely a must-try. The Black Bean Sauce Noodles was a cross between the Chinese and Korean version. It was tasty, but it was my least favorite of the 3 that my friend & I ordered. Instead of just beef/pork, they added shrimp and calamari, which was weird to me. I'm not a fan of seafood in my Jajjangmyun/Zhajiangmian. Now, let's get down to the chicken y'all. Let me tell ya, it was probably one of the best chicken wings I've ever had. It had a savory sweet taste. These wings definitely made it to overall top 5 favorites that I had to buy a box to bring home to Bae. Trying to win BGFOTY (Best GF of the Year) award nom sayin'? XDThe service wasn't so great as expected at these type of Asian restaurants. It was hard to get water refills and we always had to flag someone down.

Chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy/ tender inside. Yum!- Sizzling Rice Soup - Peppery soup perfect for a cool night. Will order again!- Dried Sauteed Green Bean - This was sweet, which was a little odd for me since I'm used to a more garlicky version of this dish. It was good, but probably not for me.- Potstickers - This was okay. The dumplings were fairly large in size but the filling was generous and the skin was thin.The restaurant feels more like they were serving American Chinese food with how sweet the dishes were.

The chicken wings are such a requirement here that when I've seen a table that doesn't have chicken wings on them (gasp..i know) I try to discern if they are from out of town and try to work in a conversation that they need to order the wings.....lolThis place is always a safe place to take friends and family from out of town. Business is very very good here. Put your name on the list if you see a line. It would be nice if they implemented a texting-wait service like they do at some of the other venues in town now. If you've been coming here for years like I have you'll notice and be familiar with most of the servers here.  Since it's so busy you have to flag down people here often but they are cool and manage the \"stress\" well.

Why was it packed already at opening time? Oh yeah it's because of their amazing kicking chicken wings. Yes I drove 53 mins in a Friday morning  commute to SF for some chicken wings. Also I needed to check this place off my bucket list of eats in SF. Arrived at the restaurant and had to wait but since I was by myself I asked to dine at the communal table so I can get seated quickly.  With a nice array of menu selections I couldn't decide but I CE for one reason and that was for the chicken wings.  Placed my order for the famous wings and some vegetarian chow mein and I was set. 10 minutes later I found myself gorging in some crispy fried wings. Battered with just enough to keep a coating of crispness with every bite and cooked perfectly where it's not too dry or too moist. Sorry but I like my wings dry and crispy. The flavor was hard to describe as the sweetness and spice played with my palates like fresh peeled oranges and a dabs of sriracha I have in the morning. Very little heat to taste but not to where you are gulping water with each piece of wing eaten. Oh yeah I did order some Chow mein, haha. That was just carbs I needed to balance my meals with. Plenty of noodles but could've used more veggies. Good flavor I would say. Reminds me of a place I grew up eating in the east bay. I have to have to go back and try the spicy chicken wings soon.
