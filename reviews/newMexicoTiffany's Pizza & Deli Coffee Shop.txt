We ended up talking to our neighbors and they drove up from El Paso to eat here.  Definitely a place to come back to."}, {"review_id": "gI9plPNrhpx_w1DraxwfGw", "user_id": "lCe7EcHq1NK8JUpr_gvq-A", "rating": 5.0, "date": "10/20/2017", "text": "One of the best spots in town for greek food. It's authentic and delicious and has that homemade taste of love in it. The service is fast and the staff is always friendly even during their busiest hours. I wish the location was bigger as seating can be limited during the lunch hour. I plan to keep this place as one of my favorites when I visit Las Cruces. I did not find a website to oder ahead of time as I saw many people coming in for call in orders. See post of menu picture. I plan to try more on the menu and will share more of my experience at this place. I do find the prices to be reasonable since the portions are large and filling."}, {"review_id": "UCCxt-5fghTyfue-lAc7IQ", "user_id": "On7KqGp-Sx4P_aJT7peFNQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/20/2017", "text": "The pizza!

It is family owned and it's aloud, happy place... The family goes to Greece a month a year.  It's ok... We'll await their return patiently."}, {"review_id": "bSJlYm1VEanNje5VPal-aQ", "user_id": "BG0dgrXMWrL3FEWJU7d3Tw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "9/5/2016", "text": "Tiffany's recently catered a Greek event in El Paso, and a couple of people told me they were good, so I decided to try it out after a Saturday shift in Las Cruces. I almost gave up because I had a hard time finding it and wasn't in the mood for a goose chase. However, I pulled into the parking lot of an apartment or business complex across from the mall to check my GPS, and lo it was there, in the rear of that very parking lot. The Greek gods smiled upon me. Perusing the menu, there were a few vegetarian options, but none really floated my boat. I almost opted for the veggie burger, but decided against it for now. Instead I got three appetizers: dolmades, spanokopita, and a trio of dips. The dips made it out first. The hummus was good, but really creamy. I've never had any of that consistency. It wasn't bad, just not what I'd go for again. The tzatziki could have had more in it, it really felt like dipping yogurt... Good dipping yogurt, but dipping yogurt all the same. The last of the three is what made me almost lick the plate. The eggplant dip (aka babaghanouj) was excellent. It had the pulpy texture I look for, it lacked bitterness and had just the right amount of salt. If you order this dish, my recommendation is to order at least an extra two orders of bread as it runs out quickly. The dolmades were quite good. These are vegetarian with rice and spices in the middle of grape leaves. Some places tend to have these soggy or forget to add the lemon, but this place does it legit. These are my second favorite locally, after Zino's. Finally the spanokopita came out. I was picturing something half its size, and was pleasantly surprised. I love spinach and ricotta anyway, but when you stuff it in between layers of phyllo dough? Mama Mia!. There is something to be said about portions being that I took just under half of my food home. What really cemented the four star rating was the service. I had three women that were helping me, and they all seemed to care about what they were doing. My drinks were never empty and I never questioned where my food was. Brava!"}, {"review_id": "53bo08tO_txBS_ixgYV2wA", "user_id": "Ckoma_QX5MKEx1fvNpq9Fw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "8/25/2016", "text": "I had lunch here today with a friend.
