So by the time we were about to head out from our hotel, breakfast was pretty much brunch...and a highway closure on a Sunday morning further delayed our meal.In looking at Yelp, we considered La Panaderia and Magnolia Haus (both San Antonio landmarks)...and since we plan on checking out Magnolia Haus later during this visit to San Antonio, we opted for La Panaderia.Located along Broadway just off 410, parking for this establishment can be a challenge. We initially thought this was a typical table service restaurant (where you are seated and a server asks for your order) but soon found out we had to place an order by the counter and/or pick out any pastries before being given a number and having to find your own table. We picked out a couple of pastries (a bear claw and a tequila almond croissant for a snack later on) and ordered a Pavo on a croissant with salad (served with the wrong dressing - ordered Caesar dressing but came with a Chipotle-based dressing...unless it's a Caesar Chavez dressing). I had the ham, egg and cheese with black beans on a croissant and a Fidel soup (tomato-based noodle and chopped vegetables). We ordered an Americano and a cappuccino to accompany our meal.The sandwiches were pretty good. My wife liked her turkey sandwich with the flavors of cilantro mayo and chipotle mustard complementing the smoky gouda and the roasted turkey. The biggest negative was she felt the croissant was pressed or toasted to the point where it was charred. My sandwich was decent, with the subtle flavor of black beans. The Fidel soup was good and my wife, despite a mix up in dressing, liked her salad.The pastries were good as well, although I was a bit disappointed that the bear claw didn't have almond filling...more like pecan. Funny, both times we tried a bear claw in TX, neither had almond filling.So...why only 3 stars if the food was generally good?Here are my reasons:- When we eat breakfast or brunch (when we don't have to be anywhere) we prefer to savor our coffee and talk. This place didn't feel suitable for lingering- There are no free coffee refills and no cream or sugar on your table...so not suitable for taking our time eating our meal with a good conversation- The place had an industrial feel and not all that cozy, although there's a couple of sofas in the dining area- It seemed like a majority of male servers had facial hair...a bit off putting for dinersA filling brunch for 2 came out to just over $35. The value isn't quite there...not an elevated dining experience. This place is probably suitable for just picking up pastries to be savored elsewhere while drinking coffee and having a good conversation with friends or a loved one. Maybe the main location is better if you prefer table service like us."}, {"review_id": "8CJRsRhH1vo5R_YIxXw3lQ", "user_id": "Qmo08Wom4GuVw_h9Q3BgTQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "5/3/2018", "text": "This is a hot spot in San Antonio!

After talking to a friend who lived in San Antonio as well as watching Guy Fieri come to La Panaderia on his show, I figured I needed to come out here at some point! Now, I came a little later in the day, so there weren't as many options available, but they still had a decent selection left, and I wasn't disappointed! It is self-serve, so you wait in line, pick out the pastries you want and then pay at the register at the end. They do have breakfast and lunch sandwiches and bowls available for order. I personally haven't With a yelp check-in, you do get a free concha - I liked the slight sweetness of the bread paired with the crunchy topping - nice textural contrast. A few friends and I split the almond croissant, the chocolate croissant, a croissant with berries (not sure what the official name is), and a bread filled with nuts and raisins or cranberries (?). Everything was delicious - flaky, buttery, filling. They have plenty of seating indoors and outdoors, depending on what you're in the mood for and what the SA weather is like. I would love to come back and try more of their baked goods and pastries!"}, {"review_id": "sS79IPXTDT-to-q9QZ8kuQ", "user_id": "aROsX0NqIOLcB7X2-BcyRQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/1/2018", "text": "Came in on Easter for a lunch with my parents and to celebrate my dads birthday.Had a egg and ham and egg and chorizo croissant.Three conchas, a tequila pastry, and a cheesecake.

I didn't eat a meal.Free concha via Yelp check-in drew me in. I was killing time waiting for a friend's flight to arrive. I was expecting a typical panaderia--walls lined with cases of treats and getting a whole tray of goodies for less than $10.  UMMM NO, I was mistaken.  -This place is fancy, not your typical no frills panaderia. -There is not a huge selection of treats (I came around lunch).-It's expensive.I felt bad only getting the free concha, so I got a raspberry cream cheese croissant for my friend. When I got to the register, she tells me I owe $3.50. In shock, I asked, \"Just for the croissant??\"YEPIn Aurora, IL, I can get 4 conchas, 2-3 specialty treats or 1-2 big (16oz) parfaits for $3.50. The concha was not my cup of tea. Super thin sweet topping and dry bread. The croissant was better but not on par with what I'm used to. Super disappointing.Obviously, they're doing something right, because the place was very busy. A lot of people were eating sandwiches, so I would go back to give that a try but definitely won't return for the bakery.

I'm hooked. I was looking for a quick cup of coffee, walked out with not only a latte, but an apple empanada (which I think resembled more of a turnover), and the free yelp concha. I started in on the vanilla concha while they made my latte. I'm not sure if I'd ever had one before that moment, or perhaps the ones I've had were so completely dwarfed by what I put in my mouth that I instantly voided my brain of their memory forever. The top shell had a perfect sweet layer of sugar, so crunchy and thin, almost resembling the crunch of a good baguette. This was contrasted with the inside that was so soft and light... airer than angel food cake, with a delicate texture that held up in my hand, but seemed to disintegrate upon my tongue, leaving me craving just another bite, and then another.At this point I decided that I needed to try the apple empanada, immediately, with or without the coffee. It had sweet apple filling folded in the middle of triangular puff pastry. I would venture to say that was the best puff pastry I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth. Wowie! It was so delicate, intensely buttery, light, crispy, fresh... There was just a bit of sweet apple in the middle, enough for a nice bite, but not too much to overwhelm the awesome pastry. It was everything I ever dreamed of while watching The Great British Baking Show. Mary and Paul would be proud.It was almost gone by the time my latte arrived. The coffee was fine, if not utterly eclipsed by the other items I had. The next time I go, I will have to buy enough to share the joy with my friends in Austin."}, {"review_id": "sDp-uKSexa42YMovamt3WA", "user_id": "52PhP4fDA3Lmt_ZAsymeYw", "rating": 5.0, "date": "12/22/2017", "text": "I was in San Antonio for a weekend trip.

The place is incredibly spacious and clean. As you enter, you're greeted with a wide selection of fresh breads that look instagramable. We ordered off their lonche menu. We ordered the Cubano and the classic. Bread is fresh and has a crunch that great bread is made for in sandwhiches. Flavor of the meats complimented well with their pickles, jalapenos, and condiments. The sandwhiches are accompanied with your preference of either salad or fideo soup (similar to tomato soup with noodles).Staff was very nice and attentive. The food runner checked on us at least 4 times so I am appreciative that they constantly check on you to make sure everything is ok. They offer water, lemonade, and ice tea complimentary.

In the napkins it says a story of where the breads come from and I thought it interesting that the levian is 20 years old and that's where they make the new batches of bread.
