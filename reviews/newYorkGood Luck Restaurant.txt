Do not hesitate. GET. THE. BURGER. I'm not even sure how I can possibly describe the flavor, other than very rich and unique. The meat was so unbelievably juicy. It is technically a plate to share, but I got one for myself and am having the rest as leftovers. We got here at 6, and the dinner rush was just getting started. The ambiance of this place is very nice and comfortable--it's really big. If you come during the day, there are huge windows and it looks really nice with the natural lighting. I also love that it is a bit low key; there isn't a huge sign out front, and you wouldn't know what this place was unless you were looking for it. Our service was prompt and waitress was attentive and polite. We got the Oricchiette and the organic greens as appetizers, which was plenty for the 4 of us. Both were great. The oricchiette was definitely different from anything I've had before, and I enjoyed the little kick it had from the chiles. My dinner consisted of a variety of flavors, so I was happy. I would describe the food here as unique. The burger was particularly remarkable."}, {"review_id": "UUxWaol3TULGobBQv241Xw", "user_id": "v8o0BzeBiLAHAcWmDrzpfg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/30/2018", "text": "It's a thing.First of all, the detractors are right about some things:1) small plates - yes, the food labeled 'to share' on the menu is in pretty dainty portions, which leads us to...2) overpriced - yes again, not a good value.3) loud - right a third time, this place gets real loud, though not too loud for my wife and I to talk.But it's a thing, this place, and here's why four stars:1) Food - delicious.  At least everything tastes at least good, some of it amazing.  We ate vegetarian here twice and enjoyed it both times, lots of interesting options.  The red lentils, while at first too sweet, are impossible to stop eating.  The curried cauliflower is very tasty if you scoop up all components in each bite.  Salads have been great.  The asparagus special was tasty, but I think there were maybe 5 spears on the plate.  But that's just what kind of place it is, very frou-frou.2) Cocktails - every place in town is offering 'craft cocktails,' but not all of them deliver.  This place does.  I had something with bourbon, beets, and ginger, that was amazing.  We've had consistently great drinks here.3) Sharing - every dish is to share, even though they aren't too big, which is great for a date.  Maybe not a first date, but my wife and I find it fun, plus we like the same kinds of food mostly.3) Atmosphere - yeah it's loud, but it's also stylish, hip, and vibrant.  When you spend most of your waking hours around kids with constant needs, it's nice to go on a date to a place kids would hate.If you don't mind the price, and you want a fancy, kind of dainty little culinary experience, this place is fun and tasty."}, {"review_id": "TjsyO3PyRFV3kBhTtD3HbA", "user_id": "2Ekxg2QLLuUNEXadNa5fHQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2/19/2018", "text": "If this review was just about the food, I would give this place 6 stars if I could. By far the best food I've had in Rochester. We ordered and split the Lamb Belly Pastrami and the Chestnut Calamarata, and both were absolutely exquisite. You could tell both dishes were crafted with loads of knowledge and care, and both tasted heavenly at every bite. It was so hard to pick a favorite of the two because they were both just incredible.We also each ordered a cocktail. I tried the Blank Maps and she the Mystery Date, and while the presentation of both was on point, both seemed to have one overpowering flavor; the Blank Maps tasted too strongly of licorice, and the Mystery Date oversweet due to the blood orange. I am by no means a liquor connoisseur and I'm sure my palette isn't the most refined, but we both wished to have either gotten a different drink or to skip them altogether.We had what seemed to be a newer waiter that was struggling with some of the specials and menu items, but he was extremely kind and patient and a joy to interact with. The ambiance is good, mood lighting and a raucous atmosphere to accompany how bustling the place is. We went in the middle of a snowstorm on the weekend in February and it was jam-packed - you will definitely need a reservation!"}, {"review_id": "LazrSxQ3Jrtnrsz6aG7dBg", "user_id": "QWi94mqRq2rRo7U83dksSQ", "rating": 5.0, "date": "4/29/2018", "text": "Can't believe I waited so long to try this place.

We learned oiur first cocktail was from our daughter and son in law.... What a nice treat and surprise as it was our 44th wedding as anniversary!I love their preparation of the Side Car and my husband enjoyed his first try at the Paloma which is a  melange of tequila and grapefruit! Delicious cocktails!We shared the Artichoke Salad which was a compilation of frizee salad greens, fresh Artichoke hearts, fresh mint and feta cheese. The light lemon vinaigrette was the perfect addition to this salad! The portion is huge at the $15 price point so we shared this delightful appetizer! My husband ordered a side of fries ....They were thin, warm and delicious. Our entrees were Rabbit with fresh gnocchi and the Fennel Sausage. Portions were plentiful so needless to say tomorrow's lunch is covered! I was given the Knock on Wood cocktail by mistake and not charged. I kept it because it was yummy!  My husband had a classic Vodka Martini with extra olives. Our server Sarah brought the olives in their own glass...Great service and thought went into that as he got a full Martini and olives too on the side!We enjoyed a well rounded cup of coffee and beautiful crema topped espresso. Our dessert was a hot chocolate cake which we didn't expect but was tasty. The side of vanilla ice cream was exceptional and really needed to cut the richness of the molten cake. We were thinking we would be served regular chocolate cake not a molten cake but suffered through it lol. As an added surprise they brought over two flutes of champagne for our anniversary... A very nice touch and ending to a delightful meal and experience!Hats off to the Chef as everything was outstanding!! Can't wait for our next visit!! UPDATE 2/10/18We were a party of eight celebrating a birthday. So more often than not this is our dining spot of choice.Unfortunately it wasn't a stellar experience. Areas failed were most choices of cocktails,  an entree that half the table ordered and service from our waiter Matt. Cocktails ordered was a bourbon old fashioned with fruit, Side Car, and Glass Hands.The only one that meets the great reputation of this restaurant was the Glass Hands with mezcal tequila. All others were just ok. The entree that half the table ordered was the Chestnut pasta dish made with mushrooms and vermouth. The pasta was a bit chewy...Another minute of cooking would have made a huge difference. Also the dish was sooooo salty. Our server was often MIA and had to be flagged down to place our order.In good conscience I have to say the restaurant was very busy and the birthday diner thoroughly enjoyed his meal and so did his wife.But for the rest of us....what happened to the bartender, wait staff and cooks?We will be back because we realize all places have an off day.  But we hope the owner is bartending and cooks and wait staff are more on their game next time."}, {"review_id": "NrKx7mLvYl0R2iH_yXxctQ", "user_id": "LIkW7aL8_yn_Y20pkpu_rQ", "rating": 4.0, "date": "3/3/2018", "text": "Love that the menu is simple and wonderful! I split their signature burger with my friend. Huge and cooked to perfection. Way too long to get our first drink (30 minute), probably because it was a big crowd on a Friday night. Wine by the glass is $9 per glass. Not great wine, just satisfactory ($9 is a lot for this level of wine...just sayin). Table was wobbly. A staff tried to fix it, but didn't. Food came out ...One. At. A. Time. And since we were not all \"sharing\" an entree, it was definitely awkward. But servers were great. Food was great. Loud, but the ambiance is fun.

That's something you'll need to get a table at this place. Only open Wednesday through Saturday evenings, this place can get packed fast whenever it *is* open. If you ever plan to go on the weekends, the employees/hostess recommend to book a reservation a week in advance, especially if it's a party greater than 2-3 people. Otherwise, you'll be sent to the bar to wait (could be up to 1.5 hours depending in the night/time you do in) or can grab a table behind the bar - first come first serve! That being said, the food and drinks are why I come back to Good Luck. The first time I came here was to celebrate my birthday, and the other times since them have been for after work or late night drinks and snacks. After midnight, there's a second, smaller menu with reduced options, but all are from the main menu. Now, food. The first thing you want to remember is that the food is made to be eaten family style. So most dishes will seem huge! The first thing I want to talk about are the fries. Heave help me I could eat an entire plate of fries in one sitting. Other people in the party? I guess I'll share... Honestly, the fries are great! Cut thin with just enough potato on the inside, this is the perfect fry. Want it even better? Can that be? Yes! Ask for the awesome Good Luck sauce. Yessss! Amazing addition in the fries. They'll give you a bottle. Try not to use it all! ;) The side order of fries is $9, which sounds like a lot, but it's presented as a sharable size that is much more than 3 large McDonald's fries (which would be about the same price!). The food itself is great. My birthday dinner included a special: duck leg with potatoes. This didn't stay on the menu, but it was good. Potatoes were close to chip style, but not as thin and crispy. The duck was well seasoned and well complimented by the potatoes. The other dinner option I tried was the steak. Who can resist a giant rib eye?! This steak was cooked rare/medium rare and very well seasoned. I will say, there were some silver string in it, which says something about the butchering of the meat. My boyfriend loved the steak and somehow ended up with the pieces that didn't have any silver string so it wasn't a big deal for him. Since it was just a few pieces, it's not a focus, but something I figured I'd mention. Last thing I'll add is about the pizza/flatbreads. I've tried the white pizza and the Margherita pizza, and both are great! The white comes with a meat that tastes like pepperoni, and is a bit salty with the meats and parm, but it's a good salt. Not kill-my-taste-buds salty. The Margherita pizza is as sounds. Not salty at all and a good balance of cheese and tomatoes. Yum! Ok finally - the drinks! Every time I've come, I've had a different drink, and not a single drink has been bad! I will say one of the best things about being sent to the bar is that if you snag a good bartender (which is most of them), they can make you a random drink based on your taste. I love a good mixologist who can just think of something for you! They'll do this on a busy night too, so don't worry if you want decide what you want!Go for the fries, stay for a drink! Or ya know, more fries!"}, {"review_id": "EoteaBOQuU2dtbJzArf_LA", "user_id": "geRo6EFWFfqbWgJPU39cKg", "rating": 4.0, "date": "4/15/2018", "text": "Good luck is a fun experience. Everything on the menu is meant to be shared, so you can sample a lot of their menu items. I came here for a birthday celebration with 7 others. We ordered 2 of the burgers, their 2 specials that day (smoked salmon salad and a goat cheese gnocchi), the white pizza, the greens salad, and we tried the coconut cream pie and chocolate cake for dessert. The burger is awesome as mentioned in other reviews. I'm not a fan of the fries but they're OK. The two specials were amazing, I'm still dreaming about that gnocchi! The white pizza was also great, the spicy honey was a cool addition! The coconut cream pie was tasty, but the chocolate cake was burnt so it was rather disappointing. Our waiter was friendly and answered all of our questions, all in all I would say this is a great place for groups and a fun way to try new food!"}, {"review_id": "ZEzLPOP55PU-nYH6uGqy_w", "user_id": "m9qYqa6m81u1VqqKmy4Kcg", "rating": 5.0, "date": "11/2/2017", "text": "One of our favorite places to eat!

My husband who claims he doesn't like booze or beets loved it, too!We shared the Braised Oxtail with tripe. Who knew I'd like tripe? It was rich and flavorful, as good as any dish in a traditional American-italian restaurant.  I also had the Chestnut Calamarata: perfect, toothsome pasta, and yummy for lunch the next day. The fried chicken is always good, if perhaps a bit too salty.  Desserts are decent too, although the chocolate peanut butter ice cream we tried last night was basicly a scoop of straight-up peanut butter. I'd give 5 stars if they had better bread (it's a bit dry) and warmer service.  Overall however I love this place and am glad they're a Rochester staple that continues to deliver delicious food and drink."}, {"review_id": "Vqgz5coKf8M6vSjGRDzOCg", "user_id": "xKwdQNkBZIpwKLWYOlyz9Q", "rating": 5.0, "date": "9/4/2017", "text": "Over the years I have eaten at Good Luck numerous times: just me eating a late dinner (usually the burger or a pizza), on dates with my hubby, entertaining out of town guests (this is always great - everyone shares everything as it comes out), parties for special occasions, New Year's Eve dinner and drinks (prix fixe) , and most recently, a couple of the Chef's Table dinners. Every experience has been perfection. If you have read some of the other reviews here, they really say it all: great service, amazing food, a bit on the loud side (and pricey side), but excellent value for the overall food quality and experience. This review though is to focus on my Chef's Table dinner experiences.Back in May I attended one of the first Chef's Table dinners for the 'summer' season. It had been promoted among those of us who have eaten at some of the Good Luck special events in the past, via email, and the menu was a total tease: five ingredients listed with no details or explanation. One of those ingredients was morel mushrooms. It reminded me of a special dinner my husband and I attended years ago at Good Luck, where they featured wild ingredients foraged in nature (ramps, nettles, fiddleheads, etc), coupled with delicious wines from Ravines winery. I secretly hoped for a re-do of that menu, but knew whatever we were served would be great.On that evening, we received an amuse bouche of roasted broccoli with miso and something like a chili oil and fried shallots. It was delicious. The first course was asparagus with a hollandaise sauce with chives and a parmesan crisp. Divine. The second course was house-made beet cavatelli with spruce tips, morel mushrooms and a cream sauce. Easily one of the most amazing, unique and mind blowing dishes I've ever eaten. The third course was a piece of white fish, broiled, with several sauces on the plate and a squid-ink reduction. Fantastic. The fourth course was a piece of roasted lamb, cooked to perfection, with crispy potato strings and a trio of sauces all made from different peppers. The final course was a fruit crisp made with rhubarb and house-made vanilla gelato. The perfect ending. For me, the timing of the courses, the size of each plate, everything was special, and I ended the night feeling totally sated. And really, kind of in love with the chef.I attended another Chef's Table this past weekend. I went with a friend who had never been to Good Luck before, who was celebrating a birthday. At our table were 4 other parties, for a total of 13 people. Another fantastic experience. Right now, at this time of year, the tease was 'kale - cauliflower - tomato - squash - plum'. There was no amuse bouche, but each course was as beautiful as it was delicious. The first course was a baby kale salad with pickled blueberries (holy yum) and onions and something like feta or goat cheese. The second course was cauliflower done 3 ways: a cauliflower parmesan cream, a cauliflower-golden raisin sauce, and roasted cauliflower complimented with roasted peppers and pine nuts. The third course was house-made orecchiette with a tomato sauce - they called it a confit, but that's not really accurate since tomatoes have no fat - none the less it was a delight. The fourth course was a piece of roasted arctic char (a kind of salmon) with summer squash and pureed acorn squash - sort of summer and fall on the plate. The char was out of this world! And the final course was a dessert made with plums and served with vanilla gelato and some kind of crisp. I don't actually know what you would call it, but it was sweet and tart and hot and cold, and really amazing.The Chef's Table dinners cost $65 per person, with an optional add-on wine menu, with wines paired with each course (yes - each course - for a total of 5 wines....). The dinners are served Wed, Thurs, Fri and Sat nights, and start at 7 pm. The table fits up to 14 people; reservations are required, and they always fill the table. Expect to be there at least 2.5 hours. And get there early if you can, so you can get your pick of the seating and grab a drink at the bar before.  Also, the dinners take place in the section of the restaurant just next to the kitchen, sort of 'in the back' - there's a large table there and because you are off to the side of the kitchen, it is a little less noisy, so you can have good conversation with the other diners - all likely to be foodies!"}, {"review_id": "HN5DiWVmkDyYXuWOaNfLhg", "user_id": "bMI2T02s60_SybKiNH-DDw", "rating": 4.0, "date": "1/9/2017", "text": "Over the years, Rochester has had many Good Luck clones pop up but Good Luck has held its own very well. I have never had a bad meal here in terms of service or food. The service is always stellar. I almost always get one of the specials along with the lentils and a salad. It is the one of the very few restaurants in town where I try the seafood. Also, I am secretly annoyed that their lentils are spiced so well and I cannot recreate it at home!Due to the brick walls and lack of carpeting, the bar area is very loud and the wait is usually at least an hour. It is somewhat quieter on the dining side.

I highly suggest a reservation! It's nearly impossible to get seated as a walk-in, even on a Wednesday night. Needless to say, I was very eager to try the acclaimed fare at Good Luck.A table of four, we split the burger, the rib eye and a margarita pizza along with some lovely beer.The burger was succulent, juicy, packed with flavor and topped with the perfect fries. It's served with a \"burger sauce\" which is a genius mixture of ketchup, mayo and.... brandy! It's a definite party in your mouth if you go with the burger. Happily serves 4 people, though I'm sure I could have split it between 2 if that were the only entree.The pizza was a disappointingly exact foil of the burger. Although it was $13, it was the most lackluster pizza I've ever eaten. It looked delicious and it was topped with some nice fresh basil, but that's as far as the compliments go. This pizza is the only reason I dropped a star. I really expected more with all the hype the food gets here. It was flavorless, in serious need of some garlic... and some cheese... and the crust left little to desire. I unfortunately cannot eat steak, but I will say the Rib Eye looked spectacular and perfectly cooked to order. The others very much enjoyed it and were licking their lips from the juices it exuded.Regardless of the food quality, this is always a great place to come with friends.
